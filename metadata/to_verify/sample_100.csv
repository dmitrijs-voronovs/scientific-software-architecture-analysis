Quality Attribute: Integrability
Attribute Description: The ease of combining the system with other systems or components, measured by integration cost and technical risks. Integrability considers the complexity and compatibility of interfaces, including syntactic, semantic, behavioral, and temporal alignment.
Content: P10 computation or; energy('zapt25') to invoke a ZAPT25 computation. This will; automatically set several additional user options to their appropriate; values. The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule to obtain higher-order; energies from lower-order wavefunctions.; For the interested reader, the additional user options that are; automatically set up by the calls above are as follows. A call like; energy('mp10') sets MPN to TRUE.; The program uses the Wigner (2n+1) rule by default; (MPN_WIGNER = TRUE); and figures out what order of wavefunction is; necessary to reach the desired order in the energy. The program then; sets MAX_NUM_VECS to the required order in the; wavefunction.; By default, the requested n-th order energy is saved as the current; energy to the process environment. ZAPTN works essentially the same; way for an ROHF reference. Arbitrary Order Coupled-Cluster Theory¶; This DETCI-based version of this feature is not yet released. However,; the current version of the code does include an interface to; Kallay’s MRCC code.; The DETCI module is also capable of computing arbitrary-order; coupled-cluster energies, using an approach similar to that of Hirata; and Bartlett [Hirata:2000:216], or of Olsen [Olsen:2000:7140].; Notably, the approach in DETCI also allows arbitrary-order; active space coupled-cluster procedures. The general algorithm; for doing this in DETCI is inefficient compared to optimized; lower-order coupled-cluster codes and should not be used for CCSD,; where the CCENERGY module is much more efficient. For higher-order; CC (like CCSDT and beyond), the code is also not as efficient as the; MRCC code by Kállay, to which PSI4 can interface (see Section; Interface to MRCC by M. Kállay); however, it may allow certain truncations of the model; space that might not be available presently in MRCC. For very small; systems, the code can be useful for testing of, for example, CCSDTQ or; its active-space CCSDtq analog [Piecuch:1999:6103].; To perform arbit

To be used by PSI4, the classic program binary (dftd3) must be; found in your PATH or the s-dftd3 module in your PYTHONPATH; so QCEngine can detect it. Check if and where found through qcengine info. If; PSI4 is unable to execute the binary, an error will be reported.; To preferentially use a particular dftd3 compilation, simply adjust its; position in the path environment variables. Theory¶; The local or semilocal character of conventional density functionals; necessarily leads to neglect of the long-range correlation interactions; which capture attractive van der Waals forces.

This keyword applies only to EOM-CC calculations and specifies whether any excited or ionized state one-electron properties are to be calculated. Proper use of this keyword requires a relatively advanced knowledge of quantum chemistry and the available options are discussed here. The options are: OFF (=0) [no properties or transition moments are calculated]; EXPECTATION (=1) [transition moments and dipole strengths are calculated along with selected one-electron properties which are evaluated as expectation values]; UNRELAXED (=2) [selected one-electron properties are calculated in an approximation that neglects relaxation of molecular orbitals]; RESPONSE (=3) [selected one-electron properties are calculated as analytic first derivatives of the energy]. Except for EOMCC calculations on two-electron systems (which are exact), properties obtained by the three approaches will not be equivalent. The default value for this keyword is slightly complicated. For TDA calculations, the default is EXPECTATION since the evaluation of transition moments involves only a negligible amount of additional computation relative to the evaluation of the excitation energies. For EOMCC, the default is OFF since evaluation of any transition moments or properties requires approximately twice the computational time. Transition moments and dipole strengths are evaluated by default for all values of ESTATE_PROP other than OFF.

Content: ﻿. <no title>. Navigation. Index. modules    .    .    .    .  · ; 1.2.1;  · . PSI4. Appendices; Keywords by Module; CFOUR. CFOUR_ESTATE_PROP. This keyword applies only to EOM-CC calculations and specifies whether any excited or ionized state one-electron properties are to be calculated. Proper use of this keyword requires a relatively advanced knowledge of quantum chemistry and the available options are discussed here. The options are: OFF (=0) [no properties or transition moments are calculated]; EXPECTATION (=1) [transition moments and dipole strengths are calculated along with selected one-electron properties which are evaluated as expectation values]; UNRELAXED (=2) [selected one-electron properties are calculated in an approximation that neglects relaxation of molecular orbitals]; RESPONSE (=3) [selected one-electron properties are calculated as analytic first derivatives of the energy]. Except for EOMCC calculations on two-electron systems (which are exact), properties obtained by the three approaches will not be equivalent. The default value for this keyword is slightly complicated. For TDA calculations, the default is EXPECTATION since the evaluation of transition moments involves only a negligible amount of additional computation relative to the evaluation of the excitation energies. For EOMCC, the default is OFF since evaluation of any transition moments or properties requires approximately twice the computational time. Transition moments and dipole strengths are evaluated by default for all values of ESTATE_PROP other than OFF.
