1368,Energy Efficiency,"Hello @ruchim! Thanks for looking into the issue. The idea behind the init script was to reduce code duplication between all Cromwell tasks that use [recently added](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/5343) `enable_fuse` flag as much as possible. Otherwise mounts have to be manually configured for each and every Cromwell task in order to take advantage of the fuse capabilities. Definitely the decision either to use or not use such init script highly depends on a workflow. From my point of view if some of workflow tasks use fuse capabilities then most of them probably do the same. Therefore the usage of init script is not required but can be helpful in such cases. As an example let's look at the following workflow. It just calculates number of files in some of the mounted directories. *count.wdl*; ```wdl; version 1.0. workflow count {; output {; Int REFERENCES = references.NUMBER; Int SAMPLES = samples.NUMBER; }. call references { }; call samples { }; }. task references {; output {; Int NUMBER = read_int(""number""); }. command <<<; mkdir -p /mount-point; mount 8.8.8.8:/data /mount-point; ls -lh /mount-point/references/ | wc -l > number; >>>; }. task samples {; output {; Int NUMBER = read_int(""number""); }. command <<<; mkdir -p /mount-point; mount 8.8.8.8:/data /mount-point; ls -lh /mount-point/samples/ | wc -l > number; >>>; }; ```. As long as we have some common initialization in both tasks we can extract it to the init script which will be executed right before each task command. If we perform such optimization then we have to upload `init_script.sh` to google cloud and enable it in the workflow properties. *init_script.sh*; ```bash; mkdir -p /mount-point; mount 8.8.8.8:/data /mount-point; ```. *workflow_options.json*; ```bash; {; ""init_script"": ""gs://storage/init_script.sh""; }; ```. *count.wdl*; ```wdl; version 1.0. workflow count {; output {; Int REFERENCES = references.NUMBER; Int SAMPLES = samples.NUMBER; }. call references { }; call samples { }; }.

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: # There are actually two timestamps in the JSON log entries which appear to represent different concepts:; # time emitted ('jsonPayload.localTimestamp') versus time added to the log ('timestamp'). Time emitted would; # seem to be preferable but that value is not specified with a timezone and is ambiguously interpreted by; # the parsing code as being EST when it's actually UTC. This can make reading the report a bit confusing or; # misleading. In practice the timestamps only seem to differ by small amounts, so no big deal to use; # 'timestamp' with its explicit UTC timezone.

On the bright side, the data set including the ref is only 23MB and will meet with @droazen's approval in terms of size. . Good luck @magicDGS.

1791,Security,"et held out from the training/truth positives used to train the model, while the F1 score is calculated using ""orthogonal truth"" positives/negatives determined using 3 families of ~30 trios each. However, there's some arbitrariness in how we define the boundary for the latter positives/negatives, and hence some arbitrariness in the F1 score itself. But I'd expect using gold-standard GIAB truth would be more straightforward. Not sure how much we can conclude, but that the validation and test F1s are similar and that the validation LL score isn't *too* far off are encouraging. That said, there is a pretty big drop in recall when optimizing LL. But we should also expect some discrepancy between LL and F1, according to one of the papers linked above. I would hope that with more variants or reliable training/truth (as in your data), things might stabilize or line up better. I'll try running with more malaria data, as well. The following trios x sites heatmap (top plot) for the validation set might better illustrate the arbitrariness in F1 (click to enlarge):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385585-1a0dfe8e-d4b7-4770-aed0-19ad81162c92.png). Here, yellow = het errors (since these are supposed to be clonal malaria samples), red = Mendelian errors, grey = no calls, green = Mendelian consistency, white = reference. The second plot shows the training/truth positives used to train the model and to calculate the LL score in the validation shard. The third plot shows the ""orthogonal truth"" positives/negatives used to calculate F1.

Quality Attribute: Security
Attribute Description: The system’s ability to safeguard information against unauthorized access, while permitting authorized access. Security emphasizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability, using tactics to detect, prevent, and respond to attacks.
Content: et held out from the training/truth positives used to train the model, while the F1 score is calculated using ""orthogonal truth"" positives/negatives determined using 3 families of ~30 trios each. However, there's some arbitrariness in how we define the boundary for the latter positives/negatives, and hence some arbitrariness in the F1 score itself. But I'd expect using gold-standard GIAB truth would be more straightforward. Not sure how much we can conclude, but that the validation and test F1s are similar and that the validation LL score isn't *too* far off are encouraging. That said, there is a pretty big drop in recall when optimizing LL. But we should also expect some discrepancy between LL and F1, according to one of the papers linked above. I would hope that with more variants or reliable training/truth (as in your data), things might stabilize or line up better. I'll try running with more malaria data, as well. The following trios x sites heatmap (top plot) for the validation set might better illustrate the arbitrariness in F1 (click to enlarge):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/158385585-1a0dfe8e-d4b7-4770-aed0-19ad81162c92.png). Here, yellow = het errors (since these are supposed to be clonal malaria samples), red = Mendelian errors, grey = no calls, green = Mendelian consistency, white = reference. The second plot shows the training/truth positives used to train the model and to calculate the LL score in the validation shard. The third plot shows the ""orthogonal truth"" positives/negatives used to calculate F1. So we can see that the difficulty in deriving F1 as a function of the score along the horizontal axis to give the third plot lies in collapsing the columns in the top plot into a single condition positive or condition negative status. Again, hard to do so without some arbitrariness; I simply came up with some rules to convert various amounts of red, yellow, green, etc. in each column to a red/white/green status. If you're u

Quality Attribute: Availability
Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: A quick question: if I run in local my workflow and I parallelize with several sample using scatter, Cromwell, takes all the CPU that we have in our machine. I then used this option in every task in order to take only 6 CPU and let some memory also for my colleagues:. ```; runtime {; docker_user: ""ngs""; cpu: 6; }; ```. But this does not work, and all the CPU are taken at the same time. And I have these errors:. The first is this one: ; `[warn] Local [f8d35e0f]: Key/s [cpu] is/are not supported by backend. Unsupported attributes will not be part of job executions.`. The second this one: ; `[warn] BackgroundConfigAsyncJobExecutionActor [7e5755bcscMeth.mapping:0:1]: Unrecognized runtime attribute keys: cpu`. Is there any explanation for this? These errors do not cause any interruption though.; Thanks in advance.

277,Security,"ed by groupReadPairs is very expensive both in time and in memory. It's a full hash shuffle of GATKReads (time expensive), that results in a gazillion 1- and 2-element Lists (memory expensive). So you certainly don't want to do it twice. But the way pairedReads and unpairedReads is set up, you *will* do it twice if you want to process both paired and unpaired reads. (And even if you aren't, someone else might try to use this code to do so.). So my first suggestion is that you remove the call to groupReadPairs from pairedReads and unpairedReads, and let a user groupReadPairs once, and reuse the resulting JavaPairRDD to process paired and unpaired reads. My second suggestion is quite a bit more complicated, but I think it would result in far better performance. I'll sketch it out here, and then I can explain it further in person, if it's a direction you'd like to pursue. The first step is to create a JavaRDD<GATKRead> in which all pairs sharing a template name are in the same partition (but without grouping them). To do that, you temporarily boost the input JavaRDD into a JavaPairRDD<String,GATKRead> by extracting the read name as a key. Then you repartition (to do the shuffle). Then you map back to an ordinary JavaRDD<GATKRead> by keeping just the value. (Note: if the BAM has queryname sort order, you can just skip this step entirely.); Now you can do a mapPartition operation to filter for paired or unpaired reads: Iterate over the reads in the partition, and keep a hash map of [name -> read] of reads that have not yet found mates. To filter for paired reads, whenever you find the name of the current read already in the table, just emit the current read and the read in the map as a pair, and delete the read from the map (you're done with that name -- this keeps the table smaller).
