Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: LGTM. Some sort of comment in the docs about when/why I'd want to use this might be nice. My thinking is, if I just want to ""try it out as simple as possible"" I probably don't want to be scared off by all these options?. Anyway, that's just a ToL so 👍 .

Might be a problem for WDL gen though (which doesn't support tags).; - [ ] Test utilities (createTempFile/Dir, etc. that return GATKPath); - [ ] Add a `toHadoopPath` method to `GATKPath` that returns a `org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path`.; - [ ] Change tools that generate multiple output files using a stem (SplitReads, etc) to use the `resolve` methods listed above once they're available.; - [ ] All usages of `PrintStream` should be replaced with `OutputStreamWriter` (code that requires printf-style formatting can use `write` with `String.format` instead of the `printf` methods). `PrintStream` doesn't propagate IOExceptions and instead requires calls to `checkError`, but almost all usages of `PrintStream` don't call it.; - [ ] Update `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.utils.report` (`GATKReport` and friends) to eliminate `File` references and `PrintStream` usages.; - [ ] Update `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.utils.recalibration` (`RecalUtils` and friends) to eliminate `File` references and `PrintStream` usages.; - [ ] Fix cases where we have a tool with a `File` that needs to be accessible to R code (determine if the code can handle non-local file paths). i.e.`VariantRecalibrator` TRANCHES_FILE.; - [ ] Fix cases where we have a tool with a `File` that needs to be accessible to Python (determine if

It's not complete and needs clean up / refinements / tests, but considering that one of the goals is reliability/scalability, I thought I'd make a PR out of it since it might provide a base for discussion. This branch has an IO Actor that handles *some* of the IO that has to be done both on the engine and the backend side. Specifically the script.sh upload, rc file reading, stderr file size reading, call cache copying (on JES), workflow outputs copying is done using this mechanism.; The actor is under the service registry umbrella, that was to be able to test it more rapidly (as the service registry is already wired up pretty much everywhere), but it should probably be it's own top level actor. Due to the Future-based approach we took in the backend interface, the IO messages (copy, read, write, delete file...) are declined into 2 different flavors:; - A classic Command -> Response; - A Promise based version, that takes a promise in the command message itself to be completed when the operation finishes. This allow for the actor to integrate with parts of the code that can't (easily) handle the response as a message. The underlying implementation of the IO Actor is a router, but could be swapped for something else. Each worker tries to perform the operation, and once it's complete (successfully or not) either sends a message back or completes the promise depending on the command flavor.; Retries are handled by keeping an exponential backoff object in the command itself. If the failure is retryable, the worker sends the command message back to the router after waiting for the appropriate backoff time. The message will then be rerouted when a worker is available.; Note that the actual time before the command is picked up again by another worker could be longer than intended if all workers are busy and the command spends time in the mailbox. ; A command will be retried as many times as po",scalab,ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/1831:197,scalability,197,,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/1831,2,"['cache', 'scalab']","['cache', 'scalability']","The system’s capacity to meet its timing requirements, managing event handling and response times effectively.

Specifically the script.sh upload, rc file reading, stderr file size reading, call cache copying (on JES), workflow outputs copying is done using this mechanism.; The actor is under the service registry umbrella, that was to be able to test it more rapidly (as the service registry is already wired up pretty much everywhere), but it should probably be it's own top level actor. Due to the Future-based approach we took in the backend interface, the IO messages (copy, read, write, delete file...) are declined into 2 different flavors:; - A classic Command -> Response; - A Promise based version, that takes a promise in the command message itself to be completed when the operation finishes. This allow for the actor to integrate with parts of the code that can't (easily) handle the response as a message. The underlying implementation of the IO Actor is a router, but could be swapped for something else. Each worker tries to perform the operation, and once it's complete (successfully or not) either sends a message back or completes the promise depending on the command flavor.; Retries are handled by keeping an exponential backoff object in the command itself. If the failure is retryable, the worker sends the command message back to the router after waiting for the appropriate backoff time. The message will then be rerouted when a worker is available.; Note that the actual time before the command is picked up again by another worker could be longer than intended if all workers are busy and the command spends time in the mailbox. ; A command will be retried as many times as po

One key difference with `SubArray` is that we want to offset indices. For example with `SubArray` we have. ```julia; julia> b[1, 1, 1]; 0.5750957798298579. julia> a[1, 2, 2]; 0.5750957798298579; ```. But I think we instead want offset indices that behave something like. ```julia; julia> c = OffsetArray(view(a, :, 2:3, 2:2), 0, 1, 1); 3×2×1 OffsetArray(view(::Array{Float64, 3}, :, 2:3, 2:2), 1:3, 2:3, 2:2) with eltype Float64 with indices 1:3×2:3×2:2:; [:, :, 2] =; 0.575096 0.631413; 0.479499 0.0708911; 0.979659 0.117883. julia> c[1, 2, 2]; 0.5750957798298579; ```. So the indices for `c` and `a` are identical. Something also seems a bit clearer: when we are computing on fields with `indices`, we compute index ""intersections"" to figure out the range of the computation. For example if we want to compute something like. ```julia; u * η; ```. right now our infrastructure would assume this is a 3D computation defined at every level. But what we probably want is to return an object that just computes `u * η` at the _surface_. This will work if `η.indices = (:, :, Nz:Nz)` for example; then the product `u * η` is also defined over the indices `(:, :, Nz:Nz)`. We can also use this feature to support `FieldTimeSeries` of sliced output. If we use this then a `Nothing` location is truly _reduced_, ie, the field has no location in the reduced direction. But a field like the free surface displacement is not reduced; it's `IndexedField` (or something), with `!isnothing(η.indices)`.",reduce,ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2177#issuecomment-1029994350:2239,reduced,2239,,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2177#issuecomment-1029994350,2,['reduce'],['reduced'],"The system’s ability to optimize resource use and minimize energy consumption while achieving required performance.

[:, :, 3] =; 0.868073 0.0576275 0.328323; 0.522754 0.663369 0.840316; 0.40434 0.631349 0.577748. julia> b = view(a, :, 2:3, 2); 3×2 view(::Array{Float64, 3}, :, 2:3, 2) with eltype Float64:; 0.575096 0.631413; 0.479499 0.0708911; 0.979659 0.117883. julia> typeof(b); SubArray{Float64, 2, Array{Float64, 3}, Tuple{Base.Slice{Base.OneTo{Int64}}, UnitRange{Int64}, Int64}, true}. julia> b.indices; (Base.Slice(Base.OneTo(3)), 2:3, 2); ```. One key difference with `SubArray` is that we want to offset indices. For example with `SubArray` we have. ```julia; julia> b[1, 1, 1]; 0.5750957798298579. julia> a[1, 2, 2]; 0.5750957798298579; ```. But I think we instead want offset indices that behave something like. ```julia; julia> c = OffsetArray(view(a, :, 2:3, 2:2), 0, 1, 1); 3×2×1 OffsetArray(view(::Array{Float64, 3}, :, 2:3, 2:2), 1:3, 2:3, 2:2) with eltype Float64 with indices 1:3×2:3×2:2:; [:, :, 2] =; 0.575096 0.631413; 0.479499 0.0708911; 0.979659 0.117883. julia> c[1, 2, 2]; 0.5750957798298579; ```. So the indices for `c` and `a` are identical. Something also seems a bit clearer: when we are computing on fields with `indices`, we compute index ""intersections"" to figure out the range of the computation. For example if we want to compute something like. ```julia; u * η; ```. right now our infrastructure would assume this is a 3D computation defined at every level. But what we probably want is to return an object that just computes `u * η` at the _surface_. This will work if `η.indices = (:, :, Nz:Nz)` for example; then the product `u * η` is also defined over the indices `(:, :, Nz:Nz)`. We can also use this feature to support `FieldTimeSeries` of sliced output. If we use this then a `Nothing` location is truly _reduced_, ie, the field has no location in the reduced direction. But a field like the free surface displacement is not reduced; it's `IndexedField` (or something), with `!isnothing(η.indices)`.
