Security,"I've now added some validation scripts that seem appropriate for realistic use cases. First, as a classic CFD example we have flow around a cylinder with prescribed flow on one side and no gradient in the wall-normal flow on the other, this works quite well:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/26657828/e3c13b81-b5d9-4fda-81b5-900013d566fa. Adding to this, as a case where we know what the flow is doing ""outside"" the domain, the flow now oscillates sinusoidally. We could do the same as above and prescribe this on both the boundaries:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/26657828/116344f5-699a-4af1-a47c-3d4fd9b65975. but when the flow is out of the domain this causes oscillations as interior perturbations hit the boundary. To reduce the oscillations we can instead say that there should be no wall-normal velocity gradient and relax to the prescribed flow (so the boundary point is some mix of information from the prescribed and interior flows):. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/26657828/09668bb2-adf5-4529-bad6-6c8c484ac3e9.

Security,"Instructions to adapt the code to `MultiRegion` from a Slack conversation with @simone-silvestri:. If you want to adapt your script to multiregion you have to:; - define a multiregion grid with: `grid = MultiRegionGrid(grid, partition = XPartition(n_gpus_you_want_to_use), devices = n_gpus_you_want_to_use)` . The multiregion grid supersedes the immersed boundary grid, i.e. if you are using an immersed boundary grid then `grid = MultiRegionGrid(ibg; kwargs...)` , not the other way around.; - if you are using any array for forcing or boundary condition, you have to adapt it to the multiregion paradigm as follows: `using Oceananigans.MultiRegion: multi_region_object_from_array; my_adapted_array = multi_region_object_from_array(my_array, grid)`. MultiRegion works only on single node multi GPU, so all the GPUs should be accessible from a single process in the node. You can check the number of GPUs available by logging in a node and typing nvidia-smi , if you want to split your grid on specific devices (let’s say GPU 0 and 3), you can pass `devices = (0, 3)` to the `MultiRegionGrid` constructor. There is another thing that you have to take care of: the pressure solve is performed on one GPU only so both the storage and source term (a field of complex values of the size of the full grid) reside on 1 GPU only (usually the one corresponding to the last region). This means that if your grid is 100M points, 2.98 GB will have to be reserved for the solver’s auxiliary fields; ```julia; julia> sizeof(complex(zeros(Int(100e6)))) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 * 2; 2.9802322387695312; ```; So make sure you have that space available. (When I have time I ll try to find a solution to run truly parallel pressure solvers, for both nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic models). In terms of outputs, we make use of `reconstruct_global_field` , a function used to reconstruct a global field from a `MultiRegionField` on the CPU.

Easy and supported prior to this PR.; 2. `user_output` is pre-allocated `Field` with full indices. We compute the output indices given `user_indices` and `with_halo` (this is what we supported previously), and then construct a `view(field, indices...)`. Supported prior to this PR.; 3. `user_output` is a pre-allocated `Field` with _non-default indices_. This case is tricker, because there are several possible scenarios:; - `user_output` is a view over a full field (aka `WindowedField`). In this case, we can in principle re-index at will, since we have access to the full underlying data.; - `user_output` is a ""partial field"" with data that covers only part of the grid. In this case, not all indices are valid. We don't have any infrastructure for constructing views into ""partial fields"" in the code right now. This is probably the source of the error we are seeing. I guess the simplest solution is just to ignore ""output writer indices"" for fields that have non-default indices. And this is the first solution discussed on this PR... but then we can't respect the argument `with_halos`. To respect `with_halos` it looks to me like we need more infrastructure for calculating index intersections.

Security,"OK, let me put my 2 cents. If we have the validations in the docs just because of the animations then we should just put the animations on YouTube or somewhere and point people there. Having the non-working versions of, e.g., `lid_cavity.jl` script in the repo and in the docs has lead many new users in the rabbit hole of figure it out. Then users feel that scripts are not working, sometimes they post an issue or ask in Slack. But who know how many other users are simply discouraged. Personally, if I download a code that includes non-working pieces of code I am very discouraged. Thus, bottom-line: I see @glwagner's point that the functionality or pipeline for maintaining healthy validations scripts (even a subset of them) then *only those* should be included in the Docs. `Sandbox`: I'm so against a `sandbox` directory! It's like keeping your trash bin in your house for ever in case there is something useful there. I used to to it all the time: I'd keep commented out code in my scripts... But I think it's a bad practice. We need to let go. The repository and the tagged versions should not include half-bake scripts and what not. I'm happy with a sandbox repository `Oceananigans.jl-sandbox` where we keep things. Or a `sandbox` branch even. Regarding this PR and what's should be kept in the Docs: I vote we keep the convergence tests in the docs and nuke the validations. I agree with the git history size issue and probably the method of including the `.png` files that @ali-ramadhan suggests would work -- I've never done it though.

Security,"Ok I think I figured it out. The `Float64` values are coming in from functions like `depthᶜᶜᶠ` and `height_above_bottomᶜᶜᶠ`. The main issue is actually the grid coordinates not being fully `Float32`. In particular, when coordinates like `grid.zᵃᵃᶜ` are ranges the reference and step size are `Float64`:. ```julia; julia> r = range(0.0f0, 1.0f0, 16); 0.0f0:0.06666667f0:1.0f0. julia> typeof(r); StepRangeLen{Float32, Float64, Float64, Int64}; ```. You can force it to be `Float32` via:. ```julia; julia> rr = StepRangeLen{Float32, Float32, Float32, Int}(r); 0.0f0:0.06666667f0:1.0f0. julia> typeof(rr); StepRangeLen{Float32, Float32, Float32, Int64}; ```. Doing this in `grid_coordinates.jl` fixes the MWE. Curiously this behavior of `range` is not mentioned in the docs for `range` or `StepRangeLen` but is discussed on the [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/the-type-of-a-range-step-defined-as-float32-changes-to-float64/27411). Well looks like it was briefly mentioned in the `StepRangeLen` docstring in 2019. The step size being twice the precision is supposed to help with rounding errors. But maybe on the GPU it can do more harm than good?. I can see how this leads to type promotion to `Float64` but I'm not totally sure how having a `Float64` reference and step size leads to illegal memory accesses. I'm also surprised that this issue never cropped up before. On another note, I wonder if this had any impact on performance.

Security,"Okay, apologies. I just didn't quite understand what you meant when you said they _seem_ identical. Typically we would just write something like `T1 == T2`, which will return `true` or `false`, or equivalently something like `all(T1 .== T2)`. Another test is to use `isapprox` (also written `≈`) as in `all(T1 .≈ T2)`. Here's a bit more background on the reproducibility tests we currently have:. We have [""regression tests""](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/main/test/regression_tests) that test to ensure that output from a certain simulation remains identical across PRs, including tests that involve LES closures. These tests involve ~10 time steps. We conclude that results are ""identical"" when every grid point is within `sqrt(eps(T))`, where `T` is the floating point type (eg `Float64` or `Float32`), for example:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/fc84215f76661e9f1cfb103dc18f86442cec9d89/test/regression_tests/hydrostatic_free_turbulence_regression_test.jl#L112. Many of our other tests also implicitly rely on reproducibility. I think, therefore, that we do have reproduciblity in many cases. However, it is quite possible that your case exposes some particular feature that leads to a loss of reprodicibility. I think perhaps the next step in order to make progress is to code up a ""minimal working example"" (often called an MWE), which involves relentlessly simplifying the examle until we isolate the essential complication that leads to a failure of the test. With that knowledge in hand, we can dig deeper to find the underlying cause (and hopefully fix it). Often, the process of simplying a script in order to isolate the MWE also produces some insight about the issue (and potentially about the test).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2766#issuecomment-1273675416:1174,expose,exposes,1174,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2766#issuecomment-1273675416,2,['expose'],['exposes']

The output is a little difficult to interpret but the error seems to be located here. ```; peripheral_node(::Center, ::Face, ::Center, ::Int64, ::Int64, ::Int64, ::ImmersedBoundaryGrid{Float64, Bounded, Flat, ; Bounded, RectilinearGrid{Float64, Bounded, Flat, Bounded, Float64, Float64, Float64, OffsetArrays.OffsetVector{Float64, ; StepRangeLen{Float64, Base.TwicePrecision{Float64}, Base.TwicePrecision{Float64}, Int64}}, StepRangeLen{Float64, ; Base.TwicePrecision{Float64}, Base.TwicePrecision{Float64}, Int64}, OffsetArrays.OffsetVector{Float64, ; StepRangeLen{Float64, Base.TwicePrecision{Float64}, Base.TwicePrecision{Float64}, Int64}}, Nothing}, ; GridFittedBottom{OffsetArrays.OffsetMatrix{Float64, CUDA.CuDeviceMatrix{Float64, 1}}}, Nothing}) at ; /home/ssilvest/Oceananigans.jl/src/Grids/inactive_node.jl:104; ```. So it seems like it is trying to do a `peripheral_node` of the v velocity, which in this case is flattened since the direction is `Flat`. In this case it will try to do; ```; @inline peripheral_node(LX, ::Face, LZ, i, j, k, grid) = inactive_cell(i, j, k, grid) | inactive_cell(i, j-1, k, grid); ```; hitting `inactive_cell(i, 0, k, grid)`.

Security,"Surprisingly I was able to get a distributed `IncompressibleModel` running just using multiple dispatch without having to modify any existing code, although a cleaner design might require a bit of refactoring. PR is still a work-in-progress so it's a bit messy, the purpose was to demonstrate a proof of concept. MPI.jl and PencilFFTs.jl are new dependencies but I haven't updated the Project.toml yet. So far this PR adds some new infrastructure:; 1. Distributed/multi-architectures (e.g. `MultiCPU`) that know about rank connectivity.; 2. Halo communication between ranks is done via multiple dispatch on a new `HaloCommunicationBC` type.; 3. A `DistributedFFTBasedPoissonSolver` for solving Poisson equations across ranks.; 4. A `DistributedModel` that creates local grids for each ranks, injects halo communication BCs, and passes the distributed pressure solver to a local `IncompressibleModel`. I also added some simple tests for multi architecture rank connectivity, local grid construction, injection of halo communication BCs, and halo communication (testing x, y, and z slab decompositions). Also added tests for the distributed Poisson solver ensuring the solution is divergence-free. Next step for testing would probably be to test that the code handles `Bounded` topologies correctly then add tests that reproduce the regression tests but on multiple ranks and ensure the output matches the regression output. ## Some notes. ### Domain decomposition. Domain decomposition is supported and tested in x, y, and z. But for `IncompressibleModel` z-decomposition won't work right now because vertical integrals are done inside GPU kernels (so we probably don't want to decompose in z). And PencilFFTs.jl supports decompositions in dimensions 2 and 3 (since dimension 1 FFTs are the fastest). As a result, right now Oceananigans.jl only supports slab decompositions in y although we should figure out if pencil decompositions are possible. ### Local topologies.

Security,"Thank you for the links !. The Oceananigans src code is very clearly written so the reading is relatively OK (I could use some explanations on your closure usage). If it was up to me I would prefer an extended documentation of GPUifyLoops ;) I only understand how it works by reading what you do with it. . The GPU shared memory is basically a programmable cache while the cache of CPU can't be (easily) controlled. In both cases there is cache so, if you compute multiple partial derivatives of a given (set of) field(s) (d/dx,d/dy, d2/dx2,...) once a block has been fetched in the cache then the memory operations are cheap. Cache is also useful for performing tiny transpositions enabling fast access and vectorized (SIMD) CPU or GPU ops in both X,Y or Z directions. . I hope that obtaining an efficient code for both (multicore SIMD) CPUs and GPUs maybe possible adjusting the (recursive?) block sizes (i.e. controlling the data layout and adapt it to the computing target). I will try to use part of your code to rewrite the toy 2D CFD solver I have translated from Matlab (https://discourse.julialang.org/t/asynchronous-makie/27127/9?u=laurentplagne).

Security,"Thanks, everyone. I agree with the major points here. To answer some specific comments:. > Btw, when I am doing small exploratory runs I only need to ""pay compilation time"" once per model. Constructing another model in the same REPL session doesn't have any extra compilation costs unless I change something in the source code (Oceananigans source code; node my scripts). This is mostly because the majority of my exploratory runs are run in the GPU, and since I have limited GPU time I try to not leave interactive GPU sessions open. If I unlimited access to a GPU (or in the cases where I can explore on the CPU), then I agree with your point. > I agree with Navid, it is better to have a more complicated script for cases this specific than a complicated source code. Again, agree. I posted this more because, if this was something a lot of other people were doing, it might be worth to maintain the infrastructure. But since it sounds like that's not the case, then I agree it's best to have complex user scripts and keep the source code simple. > Does @navidcy's suggestion work for you @tomchor ?. Yes, thanks for the suggestion @navidcy. I think this is the next best thing.

Security,"The convention we use for the other variables stored on faces is that our ""interior"" data spans from `i=1` to `i=N`. Thus we call the `i=N+1` a ""halo point"" for fields on faces, even though it really is not (its on the boundary, see #455). . In addition, we use a convention that face indices are ""left"" of cell indices. Thus `iFace=1` corresponds to the ""left"" boundary of the domain. `iCell=N` is the rightmost cell in the domain; and `iFace=N+1` corresponds to the rightmost boundary. Why do you want ""direct"" access to the surface at `k=Nz`? Can you explain why you want this? This is confusing to me and I don't see why we would want to have an odd and surprising convention for the vertical coordinate. The fact is simply that the face at `i=N` is a very concrete and real place. It lies in the interior of the domain, to the left of the cell point `i=N`. This is a fact of our grid and must be internalized by anyone who wants to work with the discrete data and index fields directly by raw index. If/when we use named axis conventions for `fields` (see #457), we would be able to access the surface via `u[Z(At(0))]` (or some syntax like that.

Security,"Upon thinking about it I think perhaps it makes more sense to run `dynamics` first before `advect_lagrangian_particles!`, one example of which might be that particles sink depending on the radius of the particle, which changes with time. In such a case it is perhaps better to evolve the particle radius, then compute the sinking velocity given the new radius before advective it. Also provided a draft example of how one could set up a problem where the particle sinks with a drag in the form of $\frac{d \boldsymbol{v}}{dt} = \frac{C_d}{\tau}(\boldsymbol{u} - \boldsymbol{v})$. ; Note: in the calculation the velocity of the particle itself needs to be tracked. This is done in `u_particle`, `v_particle`, and `w_particle` in `particles.properties` where `particles::LagrangianParticles`. The particle velocities are computed and updated in the `dynamics` step, then `ParticleVelocities` only has functions that access the particle properties to grab the particle velocity. It is slightly clunky but unless we keep track of the particle velocities right out of the box and update them during the `advect_lagrangian_particles!` step, this is the way I could think of. Since particle velocities are not updated when the particle is bounced, it will not work if the particles bounce from the boundaries back into the interior during the advection step, but for doubly-periodic domian and sinking particles it might not be very important.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3396#issuecomment-1872156350:914,access,access,914,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3396#issuecomment-1872156350,1,['access'],['access']
Security,"Very sorry for the problems that you found but I'm glad you found them. I believe when @ali-ramadhan and I put this together we were following other examples but I definitely should have been more careful. Just so that I understand, instead of having `momentum_flux_huu, advection` and `transport_tracer_flux_x` we should have had something involving the area? I'm happy to help fix this where I can. As for computing the velocity, I hope we can fix that soon as well. I know that `ShallowWaterModel` is a bit odd as we integrate the mass transports, not the velocities, but we do use the velocity a lot. I wonder if it's worth while computing the velocities (correctly) and then storing those. That should certainly help when we add in `closure` schemes, since those should be based on the velocities, for the most part. One option would be to add `model.velocities,u` and something similar for `v`, and then access them when we need them. That has the unfortuante effect of storing 5 instead of 3 fields, so it would make things more memory intensive.

Certainly that would decrease our maintenance burden during development, while tracking the Oceananigans version that the validation scripts are ""guaranteed"" to work with.

Security,"Well, there was a major bug associated with the fact that we were trying to avoid precomputed the diffusivities. Basically, diffusivities cannot be computed on the fly due to the ""predictor-corrector"" algorithm we use for implicit time stepping. Opting to precompute diffusivities solves this problem, at the cost of three additional 3D model fields when using `TKEBasedVerticalDiffusivity`. I think this is not a huge price to pay considering that models with 3 velocities and n tracers have (3 + n) * 3 fields already; thus in the simplest case (one buoyancy tracer and one TKE tracer) we incur ~20% (3/15) additional memory allocation from diffusivity precomputation. We can optimize memory allocation further in the future as well, potentially. On the upside, things are looking pretty good now.

This might help streamline the development workflow. Also if we are using Caltech's central cluster for CI we can potentially split the jobs amongst more workers, which might help speed up tests overall. Even more important is simplifying the test implementation.

Security,"Yestereday, @simone-silvestri and I had a chat and discussed the current state of the shallow water model. We found that if we ignore this PR and run the validation script on main, then it runs for 20 days before it blows up. This is different from what we saw a year or two ago, but that is the current state of affairs. We observed that there were very strong zonal velocities, `+25 m/s`, that occured in the arctic and the antarctic. This is presumably what gives rise to `NaN`'s that appear. Maybe there is a problem with the immersed boundary method, we are not sure. We took a side step and decided to study an acquaplanet case on main. We removed the continents and made the bathymetry flat. Below are the plots of `u,v,h` after 59 days. Note that you can still see the continents but I think that's because there is no forcing over land. Some good news is that we do see the ACC and it's moving in the right direction! @navidcy .

One way is to use the observation at [Ocean Station Papa](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/ocs/Papa). The UW APL group has very nice [Waverider mooring observations there](https://cdip.ucsd.edu/themes/cdip?d2=p70&u2=s:166:v:parameter). Fig. 7 and Fig.8a,b of [this paper](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-4261-2021) is a comparison of the Stokes drift between the ""theory wave"" and OS Papa in one year. [Here](https://github.com/qingli411/A2020_CVMix_in_GOTM/blob/main/OSPapa/ospapa_stokes_drift.nc) is the half-hourly Stokes drift data I computed from the wave spectrum at OS Papa used in that paper (without directional spreading). It was computed on a 1 m vertical grid in the upper 36 m and a much coarser grid below. But I can easily compute it on a finer grid if we need. . > Since Oceananigans doesn't yet have bulk formulae, we have to ""invert"" a toy bulk formula to obtain an ""expected air speed"" for a given kinematic momentum flux τ. I'm not sure whether it makes more sense to parameterize Stokes drift in terms of U10 or momentum flux (momentum fluxes saturate when waves stop growing at high wind speeds?). The reason we used U10 in the ""theory wave"" is that the empirical relations we used to estimate the peak wave number are based on wind speed. We need a bulk formula to convert these relations to momentum flux. The relation between U10 and surface Stokes drift does vary with U10 (see, e.g., Fig. 6 of [Rascle & Ardhuin 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2012.12.001)).

As for _clarification_, I don't have much to offer. Perhaps the constant was taken from some reference that used a different formulation than either us or Pressel et al. 2015. Nobody has submitted a validation test for this closure so I don't think we know how it performs. As a historical note, the paper cited by both Pressel et al (2015) and us is Lilly (1962), which does indeed use the same formulation:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127507507-c7d11dfc-733a-4472-8216-dca4e5844b3f.png). where. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127507737-94aa05d4-6fa5-4d38-9a9d-b1bbcc8a1e79.png). @tomchor I can't tell if the formula you've pasted is actually different from ours (or what the definition of `|S|` is). Where does it come from?. It'd be fine to change the constant because there's no validation test. So the best we can do is theorize, and theorization on this issue suggests changing the default to `C=0.17`.

Security,"aves. In other words, if particles and thus fluid undergo some net drift, then some external mean force must have imparted mean momentum to the fluid. So the first sentence of the Wikipedia article misleads. It's easy to get this wrong because in many systems the mean dynamics are ""trivial"" and do not evolve. But this is not always the case... The reason this subject is so tricky is because the physics of surface gravity waves _require_ a transfer of mean momentum from some external agent if they are excited (this is part of what it means for a wave field to have pseudomomentum). Thus the forced growth of waves is _also_ associated with a transfer of mean momentum (from the atmosphere to the ocean). But the mean momentum so transferred is not by any reasonable definition a ""wave property""; it undergoes an independent evolution and is easily divorced from wave fields that propagate rapidly away. In particular, if the system is rotating, the mean momentum excites a stationary inertial oscillation that has no net transport over long periods of time (while the wave field happily propagates ad infinitum)... Not that Wikipedia was always right before this on every topic --- but the view on Wikipedia is the same one that's taught in classrooms. I think users know _mathematically_ what is indicated by the keyword `stokes_drift`, especially if we well-document the fact that we solve for the Lagrangian-mean velocity. That's probably the most important thing. Buhler (2014) provides a good perspective on these issues, but doesn't really directly attack the primary conceptual error here (perhaps because such an attack is politically unpopular). I also am publishing a paper on this topic... https://glwagner.github.io/assets/pdf/near-inertial-waves-turbulence-growth-swell-preprint.pdf. I'm not sure this point matters much practically, but I think it might not be responsible to let it slide by without discussion.

This means that our formula is identical to Pressel et al (2015), but the constant is wrong: Pressel proposes `Cs=0.17`, and we have a default of `Cs=0.23`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/32c5c5a2d0f441a4b663866d511807d0f9413c90/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/smagorinsky_lilly.jl#L63-L64.

As for _clarification_, I don't have much to offer. Perhaps the constant was taken from some reference that used a different formulation than either us or Pressel et al. 2015. Nobody has submitted a validation test for this closure so I don't think we know how it performs. As a historical note, the paper cited by both Pressel et al (2015) and us is Lilly (1962), which does indeed use the same formulation:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127507507-c7d11dfc-733a-4472-8216-dca4e5844b3f.png). where. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127507737-94aa05d4-6fa5-4d38-9a9d-b1bbcc8a1e79.png). @tomchor I can't tell if the formula you've pasted is actually different from ours (or what the definition of `|S|` is). Where does it come from?. It'd be fine to change the constant because there's no validation test. So the best we can do is theorize, and theorization on this issue suggests changing the default to `C=0.17`. If one wanted to set up a validation test, it could be nice to reproduce [Compte-Bellot and Corrsin (1964)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/abs/simple-eulerian-time-correlation-of-fulland-narrowband-velocity-si",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1907#issuecomment-889189927:2069,validat,validation,2069,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1907#issuecomment-889189927,2,['validat'],['validation']

Security,"experiment really does depend on keeping it up to date with the current version of Oceananigans.

I think it might be nice to have a separate repository of ""cool setups"", each of which links to the specific Oceananigans version that it works with... I definitely see your point. But if that's true, then I think there's a deeper problem here which is that neither the validation scripts nor the benchmarks are kept up to date. (The benchmarks on the docs right now are done with v0.34.0!). I actually tried discussing this in https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1634, and even proposed a solution that should work. I think we have three options:. - We adopt the opinion that even though it's not ideal because it's out-of-date, we keep the validation experiments since they are cool set-ups that show that our code worked in the past (and supposedly should still be working now, although without proof); - We adopt the opinion that if it's not up-to-date, it's not desired. So we nuke the benchmarks and the validation experiments altogether; - We try to fix this issue and keep the validation experiments and benchmarks up-to-date.

Security,"he problem. It only fails intermittently.; > ; > We have some validation of the shallow water model in the example. I propose that in order to move forward, we should generate a few additional validation tests including some with bathymetry. Once we have those and have analyzed them to ensure we are satisfied with the dynamics, we should then work on designing a better regression test --- one that won't ""pass"" when it should not. Then we can add that better regression test to our test suite, and remove the warning from the shallow water model constructor.; > ; > Probably best to also resolve the issue with the pressure gradient in presence of bathymetry. Maybe a topographic Rossby wave or some such would help build confidence that we are treating non-uniform bathymetry correctly with both of the formulations that we have. Thanks for the explanation. I agree that looking at a topographic Rossby wave is a good test to have. In the case of a small linear slope and small amplitude wave, it should be close to an exact solution so that will be easy. If we want more challenging tests, there are no shortage of those. Lots of tests have shocks and people like to test those but I would suggest avoiding those, as shocks mean the aspect ratio is order one or larger, and that violates the underyling hydrostatic assumption in the model. We could take the Bicklet jet example we have and put it over topography and compute the growth rates. There is a Poulin and Flierl (2005) in JPO that studies that and it would be easy enough to put to get linear stability code to compute the growth rates. That way we also have some theory to support the code. Also, we could look at a wind-driven gyre problem with and without topography. Not a simple test but would help to validate the global simulations that @simone-silvestri did a while ago with the shallow water model. Lots we can do!.

Security,"ions on #1241 (and proposed as a solution there). Specifically, abstraction operations that failed to compile due to a recursive call to `identity` now compile, because we use different identity functions. The compiler doesn't complain and compiles these objects. This includes operators like `u - v + w` as demonstrated in my example. This hack doesn't allow us to execute arbitrarily complex abstract operations on the GPU. I don't think we can guarantee execution of arbitrary code in general. In this case, there are other issues that compiler might encounter that are not related to recursive calls to `identity`. We identified two additional issues on https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1241#issuecomment-738870593. There may be other problems that we haven't uncovered. An important additional case that doesn't work right now is operations that have embedded `AveragedField`. I think this is some kind of type inference issue. For `Field` on the GPU we ""throw away"" the wrapper and expose the underlying `OffsetArray` to GPU kernels. So compilation of functions of `Field` is ""no more difficult"" than compilation of functions with `OffsetArray`. This idealization is successful because indexing into the underlying `field.data` is identical indexing into the field itself, and because we don't require field locations _inside_ the kernel (we build expression trees for AbstractOperations on the CPU, prior to launching the kernel). But this idealization doesn't hold for `AveragedField` or any `ReducedField`. In particular, abstract operations index into these objects at all `i, j, k`. However, they don't vary on one or more of these directions; the indexing operation needs to be ""collapsed"" so that reduced indices are translated correctly. Thus when we adapt `AveragedField` for the GPU, we hold onto the wrapper:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/98cd4f7a56aa581defc721a01d6e1ab89b534d26/src/Fields/averaged_field.jl#L94-L96.

In the existing code the condition and classification are never directly accessed (except from inside `getbc`) and all of the other bits are based on the types:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/77ee4980a32d39d802fc6c7b2a8ef81b4c6c0c1a/src/BoundaryConditions/fill_halo_regions_value_gradient.jl#L15. so we can just write methods like:. ```julia; @inline function _fill_west_halo!(j, k, grid, c, bc::BoundaryCondition{Open{<:SomeMatchingScheme}}, loc, args...); ```. I don't really understand how it makes the code any harder to understand if we then get the condition as above v.s. writing new things so we can do `external_state = some_function(bc)`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3482#issuecomment-1988307344:1544,access,accessed,1544,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3482#issuecomment-1988307344,1,['access'],['accessed']

Security,"ns currently does not store intermediate terms in the computation of a PDE's right hand side (with notable exceptions hydrostatic pressure and eddy diffusivities). In other words, a single, sometimes large kernel that evaluates the right hand side at each grid point `i, j, k` is compiled for each PDE in a user's model, and there's no way to pull out intermediate steps in that calculation to use elsewhere. It's important to note when considering optimization strategies that our computations are probably memory-limited, rather than compute-limited. In other words, we think the process of transferring data from global memory to local thread memory is a bottleneck for our computations (we can really only know this through profiling a particular application, however, since all models are different...) Storing intermediate components of the tendency terms would probably create more memory accesses overall (since rather than immediately using intermediate results for subsequent calculations, we would have to send them to global memory, and then back, to complete the evaluation of a tendency) --- and thus could slow down tendency evaluations that are performed 1-3 times per time-step. For example, our best idea for speeding up tendency evaluations is to better manage memory movement using GPU shared memory (unfortunately, we haven't had the time to explore such optimization strategies...). I think there may be other ways to optimize diagnostics calculations, however. # Fusing `ComputedField` kernels. One possibility to speed up diagnostics is to ""fuse"" kernels for different `ComputedField` diagnostics. The kernel for a `ComputedField` is. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/9b52f3f911d26a66c75f1c3cb58fdd0a1cecb131/src/Fields/computed_field.jl#L112-L115. where `operand` is an `AbstractOperation`.

Security,"on for our more adventurous users that want to experiment with new viscosities/diffusivities. Is the issue about what we define as ""feasible""? It's simple to add a new struct with a custom `calculate_diffusivities!`. I agree though that this could result in more boilerplate. So, the difference is really just ""how much code"" one needs to write to get to a custom `calculate_diffusivities!`. I think I would prefer a simple interface that allows users to dispatch on the type of `closure.ν`, ie something like. ```julia; calculate_diffusivities!(diffusivities, closure::ScalarDiffusivity, args...) =; calculate_diffusivities!(closure.ν, closure.κ, diffusivities, closure, args...) =; ```. Then if users have special viscosities that require computation, they can define a custom `calculate_diffusivities!(ν::MyCustomViscosity, ...)`. Another interface could un-comment these fields:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/1a288c175d07b3d4262e965c7e75376d5541e24d/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/scalar_diffusivity.jl#L117-L121. and then users can define fields with custom `compute!` definitions. If we have an interface like the one above, we may not need a separate struct for `AnisotropicMinimumDissipation` at all. It really boils down to where we put information about the closure, such as free parameters. Right now we have an interface that encourages a new struct that subtypes `AbstractScalarDiffusivity`. An alternative is to do away with ""abstract"" scalar diffusivity, and generalize the concrete `ScalarDiffusivity` to any computed viscosity / diffusivity. This would then cover cases like `AnisotropicMinimumDissipation`, and move the free parameters associated with AMD from the turbulence closure struct into the viscosity struct. The first design is ""flatter"", and therefore exposes data like free parameters a bit more. The second design is more ""hierarchical"", which reduces boilerplate but is a little bit more complex. That's the trade-off I see.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2751#issuecomment-1261037943:2209,expose,exposes,2209,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2751#issuecomment-1261037943,2,['expose'],['exposes']
Security,"on; .; . for this reason I was thinking you cannot have a `DistributedNonhydrostaticModel` vs a `NonhydrostaticModel` as much as you don't have a `CPUNonhydrostaticModel` vs a `GPUNonhydrostaticModel`. About the future direction: I was thinking that `Distributed` could be as much of an architecture as `CPU` and `GPU` are. As an example, there is no GPU.jl module which individually extends all the other modules for gpu execution like the extending the Fields.jl module with a `gpu_fields.jl` in GPU.jl. But I see what you mean when you say boundary conditions and fields have to take the precedence over distributed because it is maybe more linear to extend them in a separate module. Maybe integrating fields and boundary conditions in the respective modules (how is done for CPU and GPU which are not separated) for Distributed might make the code a little too complex and keeping it separate is the way to go. I am all up for that. . Now, discussing the `architecture` vs `grid` problem, step (1) and (2) are interlocked, and choosing which goes first (i.e. grid depend on architecture or other way around?) will make a big difference. At the moment they are kind of independent one another (i.e. some `grids` have an `architecture` field, distributed architecture depends on a grid). . In the future I believe we don't want to have the users fiddling with local_ and parent_ grids. I believe you want them to specify the parent grid, an architecture, and the code takes care of the rest. To achieve that, either a copy of the local or parent grid has to be stored in the architecture type when running `MultiArch`. For the constructor you where talking about `RectilinearGrid(arch=MultiArch; kwargs...)` which returns the local grid, we can do that, but the problem is that the connectivity of the architecture depends on the topology of the grid.

Security,"pproach could completely fail if we had cut cells, which represents another caveat. The problem is that, when the cell facets are no longer oriented along one of x, y, z, we need to define what a flux across the bottom _means_. Is it a flux normal to the boundary, or is it a flux projected along one of the orthogonal directions? I'm not sure interpreting `ImmersedBoundaryCondition(bottom=flux)` as representing _only_ the vertical component of the bottom flux is sensible, especially when we consider the small scale limit or large eddy simulation or direct numerical simulation. We'll have to discuss that. To elaborate on the details, the geological constraint we have from observations is on the heat flux averaged over large patches of the ocean basin:. $$ Q_\text{obs} \approx \frac{1}{A} \int \boldsymbol{q} \cdot \boldsymbol{n} d A $$. where $A$ is the surface area of the ocean bottom (not the horizontal area). As you have noted, we can reproduce this constraint by applying the flux $Q$ across all upward facing facets. Then the total flux in our model is. $$ Q_\text{model} = \frac{1}{A_h} \int Q_\text{obs} d A_h $$. where $A_h$ is the horizontal area of the ocean basin and $d A_h$ is the horizontal projection of the surface area of the bottom. Clearly we obtain $Q_\text{model} = Q_\text{obs}$ and our goal is achieved. At small scales, this approximate model becomes questionable (but of course, it is also questionable to use a constant heat flux at small scales). Basically, I think that using this convenience actually obscures the true physics. So while it produces the right answer, it leads to confusion about what the observed geological heat flux actually represents, and the detailed physics of heat flux across irregular boundaries... That said, I take the very important point that the convenience greatly simplifies applying this kind of model at large scales. So I am more convinced that we should expose `ImmersedBoundaryCondition` to users --- despite the dangers...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3141#issuecomment-1587736510:2246,expose,expose,2246,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3141#issuecomment-1587736510,2,['expose'],['expose']
Security,"quent calculations, we would have to send them to global memory, and then back, to complete the evaluation of a tendency) --- and thus could slow down tendency evaluations that are performed 1-3 times per time-step. For example, our best idea for speeding up tendency evaluations is to better manage memory movement using GPU shared memory (unfortunately, we haven't had the time to explore such optimization strategies...). I think there may be other ways to optimize diagnostics calculations, however. # Fusing `ComputedField` kernels. One possibility to speed up diagnostics is to ""fuse"" kernels for different `ComputedField` diagnostics. The kernel for a `ComputedField` is. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/9b52f3f911d26a66c75f1c3cb58fdd0a1cecb131/src/Fields/computed_field.jl#L112-L115. where `operand` is an `AbstractOperation`. But different `ComputedField`s may somehow depend on the same underlying data in memory. Thus if the kernels for differnet `ComputedField`s are fused into one, we overlap memory accesses for different computations. Our computations are usually memory-limited... so its possible this strategy could produce significant speed ups. For example, for two `ComputedField`s we might have something like. ```julia; function compute!(field1, field2); # calls _compute_two(field1.data, field2.data, field1.operand, field2.operand); end; ```. and the kernel. ```julia; @kernel function _compute_two!(data1, data2, operand1, operand2); i, j, k = @index(Global, NTuple); @inbounds data1[i, j, k] = operand1[i, j, k]; @inbounds data2[i, j, k] = operand2[i, j, k]; end; ```. There should also be a way to generalize to the nth case using some `ntuple` magic. (Note that we tried this with tracer kernels previously without obtaining any speed up, but overlapping `ComputedField`s could be a more promising application of this technique.). # Using `mapreduce` for averaging `AbstractOperations`. We also might be able to apply `mapreduce` directly to `AbstractOperati",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1483#issuecomment-800567837:2042,access,accesses,2042,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1483#issuecomment-800567837,1,['access'],['accesses']

This `if`-statement (as well as the logicals `&&` and `||`) are _short-circuiting_. That is, `c` is guaranteed _not_ to run if `a === true`. For example. ```; julia> f(a, first) = first ? a[1] : a[2]; f (generic function with 1 method). julia> a = rand(1); 1-element Vector{Float64}:; 0.6018054291910822. julia> f(a, true); 0.6018054291910822. julia> f(a, false); ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 1-element Vector{Float64} at index [2]; Stacktrace:; [1] getindex; @ ./array.jl:805 [inlined]; [2] f(a::Vector{Float64}, first::Bool); @ Main ./REPL[7]:1; [3] top-level scope; @ REPL[10]:1; ```. The first call to `f(a, true)` executes without problems, because the second _branch_ isn't executed at all.

Security,"skyLilly` closure, while the one on the right shows results for the `ScaleInvarianteSmagorinsky` closure, implemented in this PR. The bottom panel shows the evolution of the dynamically-calculated Smagorinsky coefficient for the latter, in comparison with the constant value of 0.16 imposed on the former. Important here is that the value of 0.16 was analytically derived by Lilly by assuming an isotropic 3D turbulence, a Kolmogorovian energy cascade, and further assuming that the cut-off filter is in the inertial range. I think all these assumptions are valid in this simulation, so we expect the dynamically-calculated value of the Smagorinsky coefficient (the black line) to approach the value 0.16 as time goes on. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/13205162/4049e7cf-452e-4883-a709-a675cf12277c. Although the match is not exact (the value it approaches is ~0.17), I think this is close enough. That said, I'm planning on also implementing a boundary layer validation along similar lines, which we can use to validate the model in the same fashion as [Bou-Zeid et al. (2005)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.1839152). One thing to note is that the current implementation appears to be very slow.

Ok, no rush!. Trig functions aren't generically slower on GPUs than CPUs. On CPUs I think our code is fairly non-optimal right now, so various sources of overhead (eg non-optimal threading) can ""hide"" slow operations on the CPU. On the GPU we are more efficient, so overall speed might depend more sensitively on user code when it's injected. (I'd also argue that the beginning of this section is a bit misleading in how it claims we ""try to optimize"" internal source code. In fact, we have performed almost no performance optimization, and this is an important topic for future work.). I found this reference for the cost of various floating point operations on the CPU:. https://latkin.org/blog/2014/11/09/a-simple-benchmark-of-various-math-operations/. We could reproduce this chart on a GPU with CUDA.jl if we want to provide some useful information to users. I think if we're talking about a _constant_ (the current case), then precomputation hardly harms code complexity (both examples are equally readable to me). Precomputing an _array_ is another story (for example, a forcing function or boundary condition that depends on `sin(x)`). This lesson is definitely not restricted to trigonometric functions or the GPU.

Security,"t we are using `with_halo=true`? Just want to confirm that. Nope, that is without the halo (`with_halo=False`), when using `with_halo=true` the indexes passed are `(Colon(), Colon(), Colon())` so there is no issue accessing the indexes of the `output`.; ; > Second there is a typo right @josuemtzmo ? You meant to say that the indices should be `(4:8, 4:8, 1:1)`?. When I print the indexes I get `(4:8, 4:8, 1:0)` but I agree that there is something strange, since I also expected what you said `(4:8, 4:8, 1:1)`.; ; > This is maybe where the incorrect assumption is. If we need `(4:8, 4:8, 1:1)`, then we are looking for the indices of the underlying _view_ --- but not the indices of the Field. Because, the indices of `eta` are definitely `(4:8, 4:8, 4:5)`. That's the whole point of the windowed fields abstraction is to be able to properly locate a field in the 3D index space. `eta` is the free surface, so it's indices are at the top of the domain. That's likely the case, since it seems that we are accessing the indexes of the __view__. For example, doing `eta.indices` I get `(Colon(), Colon(), 5:5)`. However, the only way I manage to make work `Field(eta, indices = indices)` is using `indices = (4:8,4:8,-2)`. I think the reason it only works by pass a `-2` (`z` index) results from the fact that the view uses `-2+3`, where 3 is the size of the halo. I've confirmed that changing the halo in the `RectilinearGrid`, changes the value of the (`z` index) to pass to access the `Field`. ```; julia> Field(eta, indices = (1:5,1:5,-2)); 5×5×1 Field{Center, Center, Face} on RectilinearGrid on CPU; ├── grid: 5×5×4 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on CPU with 3×3×3 halo; ├── boundary conditions: FieldBoundaryConditions; │ └── west: Nothing, east: Nothing, south: Nothing, north: Nothing, bottom: Nothing, top: Nothing, immersed: ZeroFlux; ├── indices: (1:5, 1:5, -2:-2); └── data: 5×5×1 OffsetArray(view(::Array{Float64, 3}, 4:8, 4:8, 1:1), 1:5, 1:5, -2:-2) with eltype ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3260#issuecomment-2014615658:1364,access,accessing,1364,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3260#issuecomment-2014615658,1,['access'],['accessing']

Security,"tructuring:. * Break-out ""quick"" unit-tests to be run by github actions under a single configuration (ex: linux, julia 1.6) and be able to run them in parallel. We have a ""Team"" account donated by Github so we can have tons of concurrent GitHub actions so this is beneficial if you can take advantage (might be limited by compilation costs). These tests will be run for every PR push and fast fail on error.; * `bors try` trigger a more expensive CI job to be submitted to the cluster, allowing for GPU / MPI tests. The logic here is that if the cpu tests are not working then the GPU tests almost certainly won't so you can get away with executing them less often. We have a daemon running on the cluster that synchronizes the jobs from buildkite with the local slurm controller, so every step in the buildkite config is submitted as a separate slurm job and canceling buildkite jobs kills them with slum. What is nice about that setup is you can tailor the resources used for each buildkite step just as you would slurm (ex. ""gres:1"" for 1 gpu). You can run jobs on multiple ranks, multiple GPU's, different resource limits, timeouts, etc. basically anything you can pass through to as a cli argument to a slurm batch job is supported. Also it's running on a cluster so obviously your job parallelism is very good.; * `bors r+` trigger merging the PR into `main` branch. This serializes the commits to `main` (and roll-up concurrent PR's to be submitted) so that all merge commits will pass the tests. This is an opportunity to also maybe run more expensive tests (it's easy in buildkite to conditionally run steps if running on `staging` branch) because you'll probably only run the staging CI step one or at most a few times at the very end,. the general strategy is to tier the tests so that they get progressively more expensive and to maximize ci-parallelism to reduce the overall time. @glwagner can control who on the project can submit bors jobs by editing the bors access control settings.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906541778:2122,access,access,2122,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906541778,1,['access'],['access']
Security,"tself is calling some kind of spline. ```julia; spl_scale = Spline1D(secs, df.scale, k=1) ; ```. Since these functions are going to be called in GPU kernels, I think everything used by these functions should be made locally available to the functions and any arrays need to be `CuArray`s. Just looking around your script it looks like `secs` is just a regular array when it should be a `CuArray` if you want to use it in a GPU kernel, e.g. as part of `UniformStokesDrift`. I think the `df` dataframe object might not be GPU-compatible (i.e. it's not `isbits` and has no Adapt.jl function) so you might not want to use the `df` variable inside GPU kernels. It looks like you mostly use numbers from `df` (?) so you could instead pull out what you need. ```julia; const secs = CuArray(...); const scale = CuArray(...); const spl_scale = Spline1D(secs, scale, k=1); @inline Fxn_scale(t) = spl_scale(t); ```. You might also need to make variables `const`, e.g. `const secs = ...` so that they can be accessed from the GPU kernels. There's also the question of whether these splines are GPU-compatible, i.e. do they do the right thing on the GPU when given `CuArray`s instead of regular `Array`s. Unfortunately not every Julia package is GPU-compatible and not always efficient if it falls back on CPU methods to deal with `CuArray`s. I notice you're using Dierckx.jl for splines, which looks like a wrapper around a Fortran library so that's not going to work inside a GPU kernel. The Julia GPU/CUDA compiler can only compile pure Julia code to run on GPUs. We can look around a bit to see if there's a better package unless Dierckx splines are essential to your setup? Interpolations.jl might be an option but I'm not sure if it's GPU compatible. Worst case scenario maybe it wouldn't be too hard to code up a simple spline/interpolation scheme?.

Security,"ure out a clean way of integrating `fill_horizontal_velocity_halos!` with the existing time-stepping. Perhaps we just need a `maybe_fill_horizontal_velocity_halos!` function that only does something on a connected cubed sphere. 4. We need values for the grid coordinates `λᶜᶠᵃ`, `λᶠᶜᵃ`, `φᶜᶠᵃ`, and `φᶠᶜᵃ` so that we can use `set!` for velocities on the cubed sphere. They are not provided by the file but we should be able to convert the available coordinates back to the cubed sphere face in (ξ, η) coordinates where -1 ≤ ξ, η ≤ 1 which forms a regular grid then interpolate in between and back to the sphere to get the other staggered grid coordinates. 5. We need to use the sine and cosine of the local angle between the grid orientation (e.g., u-velocity) and zonal west-east direction at the grid-cell centers to `set!` velocity fields. Right now we're limited to setting velocity fields from a streamfunction... 6. Should we be filling the halos of the grid metrics? Seems like they should be filled like velocity halos but without any sign changes. 7. Make sure that calling `fill_halo_regions!` on a horizontal velocity field only fills the halos with non-`CubedSphereExchange` boundary conditions. 8. Add the cubed sphere passive tracer advection and surface gravity waves validation experiments to validation CI pipeline. 9.

It's tedious to have to type them out but could be clearer and easier to debug in its current form... 12. Fix tests!. 13.

Testability," code feature? Just to be clear, I'm not saying it should be one way or another, but it's good to have explicit justification for source code features (which are expensive to maintain and require resources to test)!; > ; > No problem at all, [heres](https://gist.github.com/jagoosw/213d7f2ce3707768d4ddb07f8827cdd2) an example (not sure where best to put this/if you'd want it in the examples folder). This is about the simplest version I could think of where we have a particle randomly walking around converting tracer a into tracer b. The specific use case we've been using this for is modelling kelp fronds as particles which grow (variety of particle properties change) depending on how much nutrients the particles uptake from a biogeochemical model, and also release tracer back into the model. I also envisage using this to exert drag on the flow at some point.; > ; > ![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26657828/188803448-86bc2fe2-dbbc-447a-93c6-ff238f6dde06.gif) [ ![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26657828/188803448-86bc2fe2-dbbc-447a-93c6-ff238f6dde06.gif) ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26657828/188803448-86bc2fe2-dbbc-447a-93c6-ff238f6dde06.gif) [ ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26657828/188803448-86bc2fe2-dbbc-447a-93c6-ff238f6dde06.gif); > ; > Although I've had this working as custom dynamics of the particles the effect of the particles tendency can only be integrated with explicit Euler, i.e. at each substep it just does `tracer[i, j, k] += value*Δt`, where as this solution allows it to be properly integrated along with the other tendencies. I couldn't think of a way to implement this as a forcing function before, but perhaps I could use a callback to update an auxiliary field with the tendencies of the particles, and then add this as a forcing function, although I imagine that could use a lot more memory if there were a large grid and small amount of particles.; > ; > (I fix the tests that's failed until we've",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2724#issuecomment-1239608678:1244,test,test,1244,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2724#issuecomment-1239608678,2,['test'],['test']

Testability," errors are present even in the initial velocities and the diagnosed initial vorticity. The vorticity error is significantly pronounced near the cubed sphere corners due to the deviation from orthogonality. For instance, in the domain's interior, the vorticity error norm is three orders of magnitude less than the vorticity norm, whereas at the corners, it is nearly the same order of magnitude.; - As the simulation progresses, the amplified error from the corners propagates into the interior as expected. After 500 time steps, the vorticity error in the interior increases from three orders of magnitude less to one order of magnitude less than the vorticity norm. I have attached panel-wise plots of the exact vorticity and the error of its numerical counterpart on the cubed sphere for the initial condition and after 500 time steps for reference. Given these circumstances, @navidcy and I are contemplating whether we should continue using the exact solution for verification in the test script or consider alternative verification methods, such as ensuring that the norm of the numerical solution of the Rossby-Haurwitz wave remains bounded within a specified range (as mentioned in the introduction to this PR). @glwagner, @simone-silvestri and @jm-c, let us know your thoughts. **Exact initial vorticity**. ![cubed_sphere_rossby_haurwitz_wave_ζ₀_exact](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/12926768/ec936d28-49e5-4da2-9f49-783e517b6f0c). **Error in initial vorticity**. ![cubed_sphere_rossby_haurwitz_wave_ζ₀_error](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/12926768/59374933-eeab-417b-adfe-56eb1e2e5673). **Exact vorticity after 500 time steps**. ![cubed_sphere_rossby_haurwitz_wave_ζ_exact](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/12926768/15c81d0c-239e-42ad-a740-8505bd3a4a35). **Error in vorticity after 500 time steps**. ![cubed_sphere_rossby_haurwitz_wave_ζ_error](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/12926768/9209cb44-860b-4a88-8d4a-946d1143da7c)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3570#issuecomment-2134152684:1739,test,test,1739,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3570#issuecomment-2134152684,1,['test'],['test']

Testability," factor of `sqrt(2)` snuck into our constant. As for _clarification_, I don't have much to offer. Perhaps the constant was taken from some reference that used a different formulation than either us or Pressel et al. 2015. Nobody has submitted a validation test for this closure so I don't think we know how it performs. As a historical note, the paper cited by both Pressel et al (2015) and us is Lilly (1962), which does indeed use the same formulation:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127507507-c7d11dfc-733a-4472-8216-dca4e5844b3f.png). where. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127507737-94aa05d4-6fa5-4d38-9a9d-b1bbcc8a1e79.png). @tomchor I can't tell if the formula you've pasted is actually different from ours (or what the definition of `|S|` is). Where does it come from?. It'd be fine to change the constant because there's no validation test. So the best we can do is theorize, and theorization on this issue suggests changing the default to `C=0.17`. If one wanted to set up a validation test, it could be nice to reproduce [Compte-Bellot and Corrsin (1964)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/abs/simple-eulerian-time-correlation-of-fulland-narrowband-velocity-signals-in-gridgenerated-isotropic-turbulence/A3D7B0DD621DE46CB6CC543F65A66F93) (this wasn't possible when the closures were written because we didn't support triply periodic domains, but is possible now). This could also be used to validate Anisotropic Minimum Dissipation. Here's a figure with such a comparison from [Rozema et al 2015](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.4928700):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/127508527-e5f7d150-56c4-4949-ad8e-90d67fdbee64.png).

This might help us disentangle a few issues (eg satisfying impenetrability, correct divergences, etc.) I think we are discovering that in some cases its better to hard code certain ""assumed boundary conditions"" directly into operators, such as impenetrable conditions (considering complex domains is the key to realize the right abstractions here, since there are many simple solutions for non-complex domains and no obvious way to distinguish their tradeoffs).

Testability," it. Another way to say this is that `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` is _concretely typed_, which means that functions of `model` can be optimized based on the types of _every_ property of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. This gives us performance advantages / reduces overhead, but also creates some limitations like: we have to define a `closure` before building model. Here's a simple example:. ```julia; julia> mutable struct Test{T}; a :: T; end. julia> t = Test(1.0); Test{Float64}(1.0). julia> t.a = 2.0; 2.0. julia> t.a = ""hi""; ERROR: MethodError: Cannot `convert` an object of type String to an object of type Float64; Closest candidates are:; convert(::Type{T}, ::T) where T<:Number at number.jl:6; convert(::Type{T}, ::Number) where T<:Number at number.jl:7; convert(::Type{T}, ::Base.TwicePrecision) where T<:Number at twiceprecision.jl:250; ...; Stacktrace:; [1] setproperty!(x::Test{Float64}, f::Symbol, v::String); @ Base ./Base.jl:34; [2] top-level scope; @ REPL[6]:1; ```. Here, `t` is `Test{Float64}`. We can change `a` as long as the new value can be converted to `Float64` via `convert(Float64, new_value)`. Otherwise we can't and we just have to write `s = Test(""hi"")` instead. Another possible solution is to build a ""dummy"" closure with the correct type, and then replace it with the ""real"" closure after constructing model by writing `model.closure = real_closure`. It could be fun to try that and see if the code is simpler. I suspect it might not be but it's worth a shot (you might learn something). . > Thinking on a more general way, it would be awesome to give a general function that could depend on any field in the model, including auxiliary. I am thinking that this way it would be easier for users to create and implement their own parameterizations. I guess that's sort of what we're doing here. The main issue is reducing boilerplate / making this as easy as possible.

Testability," manually filled out the halos of the parent (off-set) array and compared them against the halos of the array filled out with the fill_halo_regions! function. At the ffa locations, the tests fail for all halos. At the cca, fca, and cfa locations, the tests fail for (a) the north and west halos of the odd-numbered panels 1, 3, 5 (with non-trivial connectivities), and (b) the south and east halos of the even-numbered panels 2, 4, 6 (with non-trivial connectivities). The tests which fail are currently commented out in the script test/test_multi_region_cubed_sphere_scalar_halos.jl. After some digging, I found out that both the latitude and longitude values are not correctly defined on these halos. .

Testability," rather than a _field_. So `ℑxzᶜᵃᶜ(i, j, k, grid, f², ∂zᶠᶜᶠ, U.u)` represents a stencil that interpolates `∂zᶠᶜᶠ(i, j, k, grid, u)^2` from `Face` to `Center` in both x and z. > For instance, you could first create the model, define Ri and closure and then set! the model with this new closure and auxiliary field. Yes, your question makes a lot of sense! The reason we can't do that is because _type_ of any of the properties of `model` cannot change. This means we need to know the type of `model.closure` _before_ we build it. Another way to say this is that `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` is _concretely typed_, which means that functions of `model` can be optimized based on the types of _every_ property of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. This gives us performance advantages / reduces overhead, but also creates some limitations like: we have to define a `closure` before building model. Here's a simple example:. ```julia; julia> mutable struct Test{T}; a :: T; end. julia> t = Test(1.0); Test{Float64}(1.0). julia> t.a = 2.0; 2.0. julia> t.a = ""hi""; ERROR: MethodError: Cannot `convert` an object of type String to an object of type Float64; Closest candidates are:; convert(::Type{T}, ::T) where T<:Number at number.jl:6; convert(::Type{T}, ::Number) where T<:Number at number.jl:7; convert(::Type{T}, ::Base.TwicePrecision) where T<:Number at twiceprecision.jl:250; ...; Stacktrace:; [1] setproperty!(x::Test{Float64}, f::Symbol, v::String); @ Base ./Base.jl:34; [2] top-level scope; @ REPL[6]:1; ```. Here, `t` is `Test{Float64}`. We can change `a` as long as the new value can be converted to `Float64` via `convert(Float64, new_value)`. Otherwise we can't and we just have to write `s = Test(""hi"")` instead. Another possible solution is to build a ""dummy"" closure with the correct type, and then replace it with the ""real"" closure after constructing model by writing `model.closure = real_closure`. It could be fun to try that and see if the code is simpler. I suspect it might not be but ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2337#issuecomment-1066113513:1657,Test,Test,1657,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2337#issuecomment-1066113513,1,['Test'],['Test']

Testability," tridiagonal solver in the pure FFT solver. You might argue that we just put nothing if we don't need it, but then we have more ""ambiguous"" fields like eigenvalues that are not needed in the tridiagonal solver and source_term that is not needed in the FFT. I am not convinced that a single solver would lead to less (or cleaner) code. Mostly because the underlying code (constructor and `solve!` functions) is compact and slender enough to justify writing individual functions for different grids (the number of lines in the docstring for the `DistributedFourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver` is comparable to the code related to the solver). I think this improves the interpretability of the algorithm. Maybe an improvement would be writing a unified constructor that would spit out the different solvers. > 2. It might make sense to split the constructor into two parts, so that we can build a tridiagonal solver even when all three directions are regular. That could be useful for testing, for example. . I have added this capability by passing the `stretched_direction` kwarg. > Also note that in terms of operation count the tridiagonal solve is cheaper than FFT... I think, all things considered, the mixed FFT / tridiagonal solve will have basically the same computational cost as the pure FFT solve only for a stretched x direction. The additional transposes required for a y or stretched z direction will completely dominate the cost of the actual operations. As an example, this is a slab decomposition with a fairly big grid (512 x 256^2) split on 2 GPUs on Tartarus; ![311333172-43dba752-a91f-4b33-8ade-5a6ec57c982b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a376c1e-9912-4e00-8dca-91deb46338f8); The AlltoAllv is the dominant cost, while the FFT (in between the two transposes) is quite irrelevant. In the near future, I'll perform scaling tests on Perlmutter, which has a much better network, so it might be that (even if I think it's unlikely) the cost is not all communication after all.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3689#issuecomment-2276030073:2352,test,tests,2352,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3689#issuecomment-2276030073,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"# Benchmarks!. As mentioned [in the docs](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/numerical_implementation/poisson_solvers/#Direct-method-with-a-vertically-stretched-grid), the Fourier-tridiagonal solver is theoretically faster for large problems. Raw numbers in all their glory below but to summarize:; 1. The Fourier-tridiagonal Poisson solver is indeed faster! But only on the GPU. About ~1.5x faster for 256³ grids (15 -> 10 ms/solve).; 2. As a result, GPU incompressible models are faster with `FourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver`! But only by ~1.15x.; 3. More features with a faster solver though, seems like a win-win. ; 4. I should clarify the speedup is only enjoyed by `(Periodic, Periodic, Bounded)` on the GPU. For channel topologies, `FourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver` is slower.; 5. Oceananigans.jl is roughly as fast as it was before `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. ---. ## Vertically stretched incompressible model benchmarks. ### Raw benchmarks. ```; ┌───────────────┬─────────────┬─────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────┐; │ Architectures │ Float_types │ Ns │ min │ median │ mean │ max │ memory │ allocs │; ├───────────────┼─────────────┼─────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────┤; │ CPU │ Float32 │ 32 │ 6.370 ms │ 7.323 ms │ 7.089 ms │ 7.649 ms │ 139.61 KiB │ 1832 │; │ CPU │ Float32 │ 64 │ 48.449 ms │ 49.064 ms │ 49.345 ms │ 51.689 ms │ 139.61 KiB │ 1832 │; │ CPU │ Float32 │ 128 │ 400.112 ms │ 402.124 ms │ 409.183 ms │ 469.727 ms │ 139.61 KiB │ 1832 │; │ CPU │ Float32 │ 256 │ 4.036 s │ 4.074 s │ 4.074 s │ 4.112 s │ 139.61 KiB │ 1832 │; │ CPU │ Float64 │ 32 │ 6.343 ms │ 6.425 ms │ 6.573 ms │ 7.301 ms │ 139.84 KiB │ 1832 │; │ CPU │ Float64 │ 64 │ 47.988 ms │ 48.355 ms │ 48.603 ms │ 50.857 ms │ 139.84 KiB │ 1832 │; │ CPU │ Float64 │ 128 │ 405.724 ms │ 408.699 ms │ 409.013 ms │ 414.735 ms │ 139.84 KiB │ 1832 │; │ CPU │ Float64 │ 256 │ 4.333 s │ 4.333 s │ 4.333 s │ 4.334 s │ 139.84 K",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1403#issuecomment-786398050:2,Benchmark,Benchmarks,2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1403#issuecomment-786398050,3,"['Benchmark', 'benchmark']","['Benchmarks', 'benchmarks']"

Testability,"**Final Commit Details**. Remove 4/3 factor, && --> &, ζ=NaN where undefined. 1. Remove 4/3 Factor in Vorticity Computation: The 4/3 factor was initially introduced in the vorticity calculation at the corners because the area used to divide the circulation (in the denominator) was reduced to three-quarters of its original value. However, it turns out that by adopting the Haversine formula for calculating the quadrilateral area on a sphere---which simplifies to a triangle when two points coincide---the 4/3 factor is inherently accounted for. Therefore, the explicit inclusion of this factor is no longer necessary. 2. Replace Short-Circuiting && with Logical &: Changed the short-circuiting && operator to the logical & operator to ensure compatibility with GPU operations. 3. Set Circulation Γ and Vorticity ζ to NaN when Undefined: Updated the code to assign NaN (Not a Number) to circulation Γ and vorticity ζ in cases where they are undefined. @glwagner, @navidcy, could one of you please review this PR once the tests pass, so I can proceed with merging?

Huh, that error seems unrelated but I'm not sure. In particular, it looks like you cannot create a netcdf file in the first place (this takes place before any code is executed that has to do specifically with this PR). Does your code work on `main`?

(Btw, the example above obviously works fine with `architecture=CPU()`, where I can check that `dwpdz_nested` actually produces the correct result.). I even ran some other tests with even increased complexity. And they all appear to work on GPUs. For example this one:. ```julia; function crazy_calc(); p = ComputedField(sum(model.pressures)); wp = ComputedField(@at (Center, Center, Face) w*p); dwpdz = (1/1024) * ∂z(wp); println(dwpdz); dwpdz = ComputedField(dwpdz); dwpdz2 = ComputedField(dwpdz^2); return ComputedField(dwpdz2+dwpdz); end; ```. I'd appreciate if some of you could try to reproduce this result on other machines. I ran this in one of NCAR's Tesla V100s. If you can reproduce this behavior, then this kinda makes `KernelComputedField`s obsolete, no?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1241#issuecomment-786777011:7948,test,tests,7948,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1241#issuecomment-786777011,2,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"4841c96. I wrote a new script test/test_multi_region_cubed_sphere_scalar_halos.jl to verify the correct halo filling for scalar fields at locations cca, fca, cfa, and ffa. I manually filled out the halos of the parent (off-set) array and compared them against the halos of the array filled out with the fill_halo_regions! function. At the ffa locations, the tests fail for all halos. At the cca, fca, and cfa locations, the tests fail for (a) the north and west halos of the odd-numbered panels 1, 3, 5 (with non-trivial connectivities), and (b) the south and east halos of the even-numbered panels 2, 4, 6 (with non-trivial connectivities). The tests which fail are currently commented out in the script test/test_multi_region_cubed_sphere_scalar_halos.jl. After some digging, I found out that both the latitude and longitude values are not correctly defined on these halos. . To delve into the root of the issue, I first replace the line ; ```julia; Ψᵣ(λ, φ, z) = - U * R * (sind(φ) * cosd(α) - cosd(λ) * cosd(φ) * sind(α)); ```; with; ```julia; Ψᵣ(λ, φ, z) = λ ; ```; in test/test_multi_region_cubed_sphere_scalar_halos.jl, and run the script:; ```julia; julia> include(""test/test_multi_region_cubed_sphere_scalar_halos.jl""); ```; Then I type the following commands over the terminal and study the output:; ```julia; julia> Nx, Ny, Nz = 3, 3, 1; (3, 3, 1). julia> grid = ConformalCubedSphereGrid(panel_size = (Nx, Ny, Nz), z = (0, 1), radius = 1, horizontal_direction_halo = 3, z_halo = 1); ConformalCubedSphereGrid{Float64, FullyConnected, FullyConnected, Bounded} partitioned on CPU():; ├── grids: 3×3×1 OrthogonalSphericalShellGrid{Float64, FullyConnected, FullyConnected, Bounded} on CPU with 3×3×1 halo and with precomputed metrics; ├── partitioning: CubedSpherePartition with (1 region in each panel); ├── connectivity: CubedSphereConnectivity; └── devices: (CPU(), CPU(), CPU(), CPU(), CPU(), CPU()). julia> data_1 = create_c_test_data(grid); CubedSphereField{Center, Center, Center}; ├── g",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3280#issuecomment-1743842511:1117,test,test,1117,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3280#issuecomment-1743842511,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"> (this is how PISCES implements a lot of the growth to prevent repetitive calculation of the same values, I don't know if this would be faster in this setting without testing but just as an example). I agree that we need this feature, but from a software design perspective one might argue that such an invasive change to model dynamics belongs in the source code itself, rather than a callback (and this of course how it works for PISCES, or any model other than Oceananigans --- since Oceananigans is the only model where we can envision such a fine-grained callback schema). I think having a callback infrastructure like this effectively allows people who implement advanced / custom applications to keep their code up to date with other changes to Oceananigans. The alternative model for software design, which is simply to create a new version of the source code for your custom application, leads to much more code duplication.

Testability,"> 1. I tried something in a gist here ( https://gist.github.com/christophernhill/d1f07cec81c19df9903b18461ba38250 ) that seems to suggest that if we accept we are only really interested in finding a potential whose ""difference"" (weighted in some way) makes our source terms non-divergent then it may be possible to use FFT approach with a stretched grid? In other words we aren't so interested in the pressure, more the gradient of the pressure.; > I am not sure I believe the result, since it seems like someone would have done it 40+ years ago if this was the case. On the other hand the gist does seem to work, and I can't see what I am missing! I would be interested to chat about whether there is something I am overlooking. That is intriguing. If I understand correctly, the test code indeed provides a divergence-free field by adding a finite-difference to the velocity. I wonder if on a stretched grid the approach makes sure the added force is actually a pressure gradient (i.e. derives from a potential). In other words, maybe on a stretched grid the code tested might lead to energy inconsistencies ?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1727#issuecomment-855238172:781,test,test,781,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1727#issuecomment-855238172,2,['test'],"['test', 'tested']"
Testability,"> 1. Should we change the flux convention in Oceananigans so that `FluxBoundaryCondition` specifies the flux along the _inward pointing normal_? This reverses the convention we use on ""right"" boundaries (west, north, top). For example, a negative buoyancy flux would cause cooling at the surface with this convention. This is a huge change, but I think is necessary to do things like specifying a drag boundary condition on vertical velocity (I can discuss further why this is the case if needed.). I quite like the current convention for specifying fluxes since (imho) it's more mathematically intuitive, so my vote goes to maintaining that convention if we can (although I agree that it makes it harder to apply it generally for immersed solids...). One way to do it would be to leave most of the heavy work for the user, which would have to specify fluxes in each of the immersed solid's interfaces separately. The user's script would look like what I did here:; https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/faed0c4ac85409cb94811b0bdba2bbb7becf330a/sandbox/drag_test.jl#L25-L41. The downside is that this won't work for non-grid-fitted boundaries and requires more user-written code. The upside is that could (I think) re-use much of the inner-workings of the current BC implementation. > We can do 2. without 1. In that case we'll be able to support a lot of common cases, including ordinary oceanic cases (where boundaries do not overhang, and we only specify drag on tangential components). It's really LES cases that become tricky because we can't specify drag on vertical velocity components, or on tangential components when the boundary overhangs. Not sure I understand this point. Do you mind clarifying @glwagner? By ""overhang"" do you mean that there's no fluid-to-the-bottom-immersed-boundary-to-the-top interface?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-1086345975:1053,sandbox,sandbox,1053,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-1086345975,2,['sandbox'],['sandbox']
Testability,"> 2\. It would be a good idea in my opinion to support either options of passing the prefix or the filename (as many softwares do) so that we always preservw the extension which I believe is our priority. (Just implement a check on the last relevant characters, if there is a correct extension leave it as is otherwise append it). I think this is an excellent suggestion!. We can do. ```julia; dotindex = findlast('.', filename); possible_ext = isnothing(dotindex) ? """" : filename[dotindex+1:end]; possible_ext == "".nc"" || filename *= "".nc""; ```. We can put similar logic into `FieldTimeSeries`. I was stuck on trying to throw an error if the ext is wrong, which has the major downside that we can't use `.` in filenames anymore. But this is a pretty nice solution I think. The main downside is that if you accidentally call your file `.jld2` for netcdf then you'll end up with a file `.jld2.nc`. But I think we can just _recommend_ that `filename` has no extension and we figure it out. And we also support explicit extensions for users that want that interface, with the caveat that if they screw up they'll have funny filenames.

But these two will result to the same array. So I'm confused. I understand that there is no test for these things, but the chances of breaking the code is nil because the same logic applies to the remaining halo points. Regarding the index shifting, your example is not quite analogous to our case. Just consider my example above, where field_1[2:Nc+1, Nc+1:Nc+Hc] of panel 1 corresponds to field_2[1:Hc, 1:Nc] of panel 3. That is for sure, right? If, instead, I specified field_1[2:Nc, Nc+1:Nc+Hc] of panel 1 corresponds to field_2[1:Hc, 2:Nc] of panel 3, that would have removed the additional row/column of halo fills and made it look cleaner. I thought if the additional row/column were filled incorrectly, it would have been reflected in the remaining rows/columns as well, since the halos were filled in the same way.

I think it sounds like a great idea to support `AbstractOperation` output. It's kind of logical. Doing this even allows us to do some clever stuff behind the scenes, like using one underlying array to store the results of multiple computations performed serial (thus saving memory). The confusion is that I wasn't aware that that a `Field` has `data`, and therefore takes up memory, which allows it to store values. While an `AbstractOperation` is just instructions on how to compute things. This extended to the output writers, but I wouldn't say output writers were the source of confusion.

Testability,"> > I'm strongly opposed to having multiple small packages.; >; > Why is that, given the benefits?. Mainly I think we can get all the same benefits by maintaining a single unified and tidy repository with sub-modules. I don't see Oceananigans as a complex project yet, we're barely at 2,500 lines of code (minus turbulence closure operators which aren't integrated yet). I can see reasons for having a separate repository for examples and tutorials if there are enough of them, but I don't see e.g. the output writers as being logically separate from the main code. As a stand alone package, OceananigansOutput.jl doesn't do anything useful. Something like TurbulenceClosures.jl could though. Keeping things in tidy submodules within a single repository increases code visibility, which I think is important. When I see a package or framework spread across multiply small packages I find it hard to get an idea about what it can do. Another nice thing is we currently have ""unified versioning"" so when releases occur we know everything works together. We don't have to worry about running with Oceananigans v0.x with OceananigansPlotting v0.y and OceananigansOutput#master to fix some issue. From a development perspective, issues and pull requests are now spread across multiple repositories and we can end up with pull requests that depend on other pull requests in other repositories, e.g. when adding in halo regions the main code got refactored but so did the output writers and plotting code would change as well. We can also end up with multiple test suites that need to pass, plus possibly multiple CI pipelines to manage. So right now it's easy to make atomic changes that touch upon multiple pieces of code (and we'll probably be in this stage where we need to refactor frequently for a while). I also don't have to git clone a bunch of repositories just to work on a simple example.

Additionally, the fields of the solvers are tailored to their task; for example, there is no tridiagonal solver in the pure FFT solver. You might argue that we just put nothing if we don't need it, but then we have more ""ambiguous"" fields like eigenvalues that are not needed in the tridiagonal solver and source_term that is not needed in the FFT. I am not convinced that a single solver would lead to less (or cleaner) code. Mostly because the underlying code (constructor and `solve!` functions) is compact and slender enough to justify writing individual functions for different grids (the number of lines in the docstring for the `DistributedFourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver` is comparable to the code related to the solver).

Do you know of any scaling results that people have done using this multiGPU approach? I'd be keen to try this with Oceananigans when it's working. I know that we tried using MPI and GPU last summer and had some problems. One, getting it to work was a pain. Two, the effiicency dropped down to 60% when going fro 1 to 2 GPUs. I now we can do better, and maybe this is a way of doing that. One key problem to solve is that we cannot pass non-contiguous data between GPUs without scalar operations. This affects both ""direct"" communication via the CUDA.jl API and cuda-aware MPI. As a result passing non-continuous data is _extremely_ slow and is probably the primary reason for the abysmal multi-GPU scaling we saw. I believe @simone-silvestri is going to use a single layer buffer to pass halo data (copy halo to buffer, pass to buffer on remote device, then copy from remote buffer to remote halo).

I tried setting up a simulation with `closure = (AnisotropicMinimumDissipation(), ScalarDiffusivity(ν=κ,κ=κ))` but am getting errors with `no method matching south_ib_flux`. Could this be specific to immersed boundary or has the turbulence closure definition of the molecular values of kinematic viscosity and diffusivity changed since #1277?. Here's a question. Doing wall-resolved LES is a bit tricky here. In the way the code is written, the diffusivity for wall fluxes with value or gradient boundary condition is derived from the model closure. For closure tuples, the logical thing to do is to add all the diffusivities together to come up with the immersed flux. However, this means that to do wall resolved LES we have to solve a tricky problem which is how to specify that the LES diffusivity has a value of 0 on the boundary. The interface implemented here doesn't support that; when we write `ValueBoundaryCondition(0)` what that means is that we add fluxes to a tendency consistent with `ValueBoundaryCondition(0)`. (The alternative, which would essentially mean ""return `0` when the field is reconstructed on boundary faces"" requires feeding boundary conditions into the reconstruction operator used by the closure. Doing that would substantially complicate the code.) This means effectively that there's no way to set the LES diffusivity to 0 on an immersed boundary. Even if there were a way to ensure this, it's also inconvenient to have to specify boundary conditions on the LES diffusivities... An alternative approach might attach a diffusivity / viscosity to the immersed boundary condition. Then the closure is ignored when calculating the immersed flux and the ""boundary diffusivity"" is used instead. This has some convenience downsides (ie diffusivity values have to be passed both to the closure _and_ the boundary condition), but would a",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2437#issuecomment-1107321166:14,test,tested,14,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2437#issuecomment-1107321166,2,"['log', 'test']","['logical', 'tested']"

Testability,"> @tomchor @whitleyv what's the ultimate vision for this PR. I think we just want to add a more ""precise"" drag option to IB by using the `conditional_flux` functions, so that a drag can be added at the exact locations that need it for the grid fitted version, while also avoiding the user having to call the correct conditional for each location. (For context, when adding drag to IB I have been just adding drag as a forcing over a cell-width above the boundary. So I'd prefer something a little more exact.) Hard coding this option in is mostly a test to see how it would go while using the available framework, before creating a full method that users would be able to implement nicely. . Implementing immersed boundary conditions as a separate term would work, I believe! A `value` immersed option wouldn't involve as much effort (as we've previously worked out for no slip), besides getting the direction correct. I think, one of our concerns was the interpolating of field dependencies within a functional form of a boundary condition, and how they would interact with the IB, could it be generalized to any input.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2275#issuecomment-1075635953:549,test,test,549,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2275#issuecomment-1075635953,1,['test'],['test']

The rationale is that even though the immersed Poisson solver isn't progressing right now (and I agree we shouldn't wait for it), when it does progress it may turn out that it works better with the original (i.e. hydrostatic pressure separation) algorithm.

The main issue is that the dynamics can be ""correct"" but the test can fail. I feel its a bad test for this reason. I don't have much to add to the discussion. I agree with you that a balanced state in a continuous system doesn't necessarily translate exactly to a discrete one. When I (or Ali?) came up with this test I figured this translation error would be small enough to be acceptable, and when the test actually passed I was happy enough with that. So if this translation error is indeed large enough with the new solver that the tests don't pass I'm very much okay with changing the test. I can't, for the moment, think of another simple test to replace it though.

However, I assume I must have done something wrong with my MWE because when I finally was able to test this with my main research code I wasn't able to start the simulation; - The issue that popped up was a scalar indexing one.

Testability,"> A question @ali-ramadhan , how much work will it be to have a stretched grid in `x`? I ask because I want to do a `ShallowWaterModel` run wtih a western boundary current and an intensified western grid. I'm happy to work on this sometime but curious as to how much effort you think this will take, after it is fully tested of course. The hardest part of implementing a vertically-stretched grid for an incompressible model was implementing and testing the pressure solver. So it should be pretty straightforward to stretch x and y for `ShallowWaterModel` (or any model without a pressure solver), just maybe a little tedious. . Right now in `Oceananigans.Operators` we have functions `Δx(i, j, k, grid)` and `Δy(i, j, k, grid)` that return the grid spacings at grid point `[i, j, k]`. Stretching the staggered grid in x and y we will need to add `ΔxC` and `ΔxF` functions (same for y) for the grid spacing between cell centers and cell faces and use them in the appropriate places (same for area and volume functions). This will probably mirror what has been done for z with `ΔzF` and `ΔzC`. Thankfully it'll probably be hard to break the code since there are so many tests in place that will fail if you miss a change.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1348#issuecomment-776236013:318,test,tested,318,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1348#issuecomment-776236013,3,['test'],"['tested', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"> Ah interesting. Does this work because broadcasting over GPU subarray views is a little rough around the edges?; > ; > Also, is it worth adding the MWE from [#1767 (comment)](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1767#issuecomment-868793917) as a test?. Certainly _something_ is rough... I think it's ""broadcasting over ReducedField"" that's the issue here. Prior to this PR, `mean!` used a broadcast over `R::AbstractReducedField` to compute the normalization. For some reason this has data synchronicity issues on the GPU (I'm at a loss to explain why). This PR just changes that broadcast operation to compute over all members of `R`. The halo regions of `R` (presumably) aren't touched during `sum!`, so doing some extra normalization in the halos doesn't really matter, I guess... (if we want halos to be right we should probably fill them after executing `mean!` in `compute!`, or something). But the _reason_ why this change fixes the issue isn't at all obvious to me. Maybe there's a bad interaction between `KernelAbstractions` (which gets used for the broadcast) and `sum!`? Not sure. Maybe another solution would wrap `sum!` in `CUDA.@sync` (eg the solution here could _implicitly_ synchronize in order to perform the broadcast correctly; otherwise CUDA wouldn't work generally... ?!?). Might be worth testing that, though I don't know which solution we should prefer (if any).

Right? That's a nice improvement!. Yes, I think so. I didn't test many, but I did confirm that `u - v + w` will compile (where it did not previously). The error we were previously receiving was ""dynamic function invocation error"". This is often a type inference problem: if the julia compiler cannot infer types probably, then the resulting julia code cannot be translated into CUDA. Thus the kernel still contains ""dynamic julia functions"". This is the same error we get when trying to compile operations containing `AveragedField`. But apparently the compilation issues for those kernels are different and not resolved by this PR sadly. I think there is a very specific issue associated with `AveragedField`. .

The problem is that, except for `IterationInterval`, we usually can't _guarantee_ that a schedule will always actuate on the _next iteration_ (since the time-step can be modified by a callback, or by an alignment requirement associated with another schedule present in the simulation). Users can implement a custom ""just before iteration interval"" schedule to achieve a backward difference (with respect to other quantities that are output on `IterationInterval` by writing. ```julia; primary_schedule = IterationInterval(10); just_before_iteration_interval(model) = model.clock.iteration + 1 % primary_schedule.interval == 0; schedule = ConsecutiveIterations(just_before_iteration_interval); ```. Thinking about it a bit, I think that we do want to calculate a forward difference for most purposes.

Testability,"> Can you please restate this? I think a code example would be helpful with an explanation on what's being accomplished. Also can you explain why this can't be implemented with a Callback (or forcing function)? I.e., why do we desire this as a source code feature? Just to be clear, I'm not saying it should be one way or another, but it's good to have explicit justification for source code features (which are expensive to maintain and require resources to test)!. No problem at all, [heres](https://gist.github.com/jagoosw/213d7f2ce3707768d4ddb07f8827cdd2) an example (not sure where best to put this/if you'd want it in the examples folder). This is about the simplest version I could think of where we have a particle randomly walking around converting tracer a into tracer b. The specific use case we've been using this for is modelling kelp fronds as particles which grow (variety of particle properties change) depending on how much nutrients the particles uptake from a biogeochemical model, and also release tracer back into the model. I also envisage using this to exert drag on the flow at some point. ![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26657828/188803448-86bc2fe2-dbbc-447a-93c6-ff238f6dde06.gif). Although I've had this working as custom dynamics of the particles the effect of the particles tendency can only be integrated with explicit Euler, i.e. at each substep it just does `tracer[i, j, k] += value*Δt`, where as this solution allows it to be properly integrated along with the other tendencies. I couldn't think of a way to implement this as a forcing function before, but perhaps I could use a callback to update an auxiliary field with the tendencies of the particles, and then add this as a forcing function, although I imagine that could use a lot more memory if there were a large grid and small amount of particles.

No, the ternary operator `a ? b : c` is shorthand for . ```julia; if a; b; else; c; end; ```. This `if`-statement (as well as the logicals `&&` and `||`) are _short-circuiting_. That is, `c` is guaranteed _not_ to run if `a === true`.

The first call to `f(a, true)` executes without problems, because the second _branch_ isn't executed at all.

Luckily, I found a reliable way to get NaNs immediately is to set both `reltol` and `abstol` to zero and `maxiter` to more than a thousand. The purpose is to test the numerical stability of the iteration method. My theory is that the current CG iteration solver is numerically unstable.

Testability,"> Hmmm, I don't know if many log levels will be that helpful. I'm not entirely sure either. It's worth considering whether the standard `Info` and `Debug` levels might be enough for some of your uses, but there's also nothing wrong with trying out some custom levels and removing them if they don't end up making sense. For general logging I've often wondered whether it would be helpful to have a `Notice` level with severity between `Info` and `Warn` to allow informational messages to be stratified into two groups, though we would need clear guidelines for how to use it. Likewise, to have a `Debug2` or `VerboseDebug` level for ""really verbose"" debugging messages (possibly compiled out by default, though that would need a minor tweak in Base to make it possible). > but for user-facing info messages maybe we should remove the file name and line number and instead a custom log level like `DIAGNOSTIC` or `MODEL_SETUP` will be useful. This is basically what the standard `Info` level printing does in `Logging.ConsoleLogger` - it just ignores the line and file info captured by the fontend to simplify the pretty printing of the message. Btw, the pretty printing of log events can be separate from the storage format if desired.

Probably just https://github.com/glwagner/ColumnModelOptimizationProject/blob/master/les/deepening_mixed_layer.jl; 2. A script that produces plots from the data.

Testability,"> I believe for your implementation, since the tracer values are not corrected for pressure, any leakage will be due to the advection of tracer by momentum that _is_ impacted by the pressure correction. This advection should be less with a smaller spacial step if I remember correctly. Well, I agree that less leakage implies that less tracer is advected across the boundary. But why is less tracer advected across the boundary?. It occurs to me that we are not converging to a particular solution as we refine the grid in this case, because this problem has no viscosity. Perhaps we should do a convergence test for a case with finite viscosity. We do introduce grid-scale gradients in the predictor velocity field via masking, so it does seem possible to me that the leakage / pressure gradient error might scale with resolution. It'd be nice to have a solid mathematical explanation for this behavior. Another question might be whether the leakage / error depends on the extent of the masked region (holding resolution constant).

The domain is horizontally periodic and vertically bounded with one point in the y-direction; therefore the grid could be made `Flat` in the y-direction. Also, the wave has a vertical wavenumber of 16 and a horizontal wavenumber of 1, so it has a thin aspect ratio and is nearly hydrostatic.

Testability,"> I don’t like “Singleton”: Periodic and Bounded refer to the physical nature of the dimension, while Singleton obliquely references the size of an underlying array of discrete data. A better name would refer to the physical nature of the coordinate; “Uniform” or “Flat” are examples. We're setting up a discrete model anyways, but I guess if it's supposed to model some physical system then ""Singleton"" may not be completely appropriate. I'd vote for Flat over Uniform then. Uniform could be multiple grid points while Flat strongly implies one grid point (while both imply homogenous dynamics in that dimension). > It could make sense to make (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded) a default. This is already the default of Model. Yeah I guess we have a choice here: do we want to make horizontally periodic the default or are users now required to specify a grid topology?. I could see benefits either way. Keeping it the default would introduce no breaking changes and simplify the tests, but requiring it would improve the clarity of most scripts (an issue that has been brought up before, see #459).

Testability,"> I encountered similar issues months ago when using the CG Poisson solver. I fixed my code by slightly modifying the algorithm ([Yixiao-Zhang@c7983b8/\](https://github.com/Yixiao-Zhang/Oceananigans.jl/commit/c7983b8002b91cd5939018a7c999eae77e2105ac/\)). The reason is that the CG method can be numerically unstably for positive (or negative) semi-definite matrices. Did you encounter the same issue whereby the simulation would _immediately_ NaN (rather than intermittently)? I'd be curious to see your setup in order to have more than one working example to test with. I've made a little progress with regularizing the solver (vs the simpler technique of setting the mean directly). The issue is that while regularization does seem to be able to stabilize the solver, we still experience extremely slow convergence with `FlatExtrapolationOpenBoundaryCondition` to the point that it's basically unusable practically, I think (at least if the same convergence rate is experienced at higher resolution / with better physics).

Testability,"> I like @glwagner 's suggestions.; > ; > One question: if we remove examples can they still reside in tests of somewhere else where people can dig them up if they want to see them or will they disappear?. That's a great question, since there are really two points at stake here and there's more than one way to provide ""examples"" to users. In any case, providing ""assured"" examples required testing. That's perhaps why we're hesitant to advertise the huge amount of code in `validation` as a resource for users. It is a resource, but only if you know what you're doing, because the scripts often go stale and we don't have the mojo to test them all in CI right now. ""Examples"" are scripts that we'd like to offer to users as guaranteed-to-work pieces of code to get them started. Right now, we build all of our examples with `Documenter.jl`. This both tests that the examples work correctly, and also allows users to browse the examples in html (pretty sweet). But currently (and just because we haven't devoted time to cracking the problem) this means we have limited computational resources for examples. But another possible solution is to test examples in CI _without_ piping them through documenter. Those scripts would then be available for viewing on github (and we can link to them in the docs); it's just that we wouldn't get the pretty markdown / images / movies. If we don't use Documenter then we can run these tests like any others, and also test examples for GPU. We currently test just one script this way, namely the stratified couette flow validation test:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/e796a5de99e791466ef43ab1ed8628b4c4d62f64/test/test_validation.jl#L13-L27",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2326#issuecomment-1062870462:103,test,tests,103,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2326#issuecomment-1062870462,10,['test'],"['test', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"> I now recall the reason for the discrepancy. It was due to an index shift, which made filling the extra layer of halos quite straightforward, so I proceeded with it. For example, field_1[2:Nc+1, Nc+1:Nc+Hc] from an odd panel corresponds to field_2[1:Hc, 1:Nc] from the panel to the north. I can modify this expression to field_1[2:Nc, Nc+1:Nc+Hc] aligning with field_2[1:Hc, 2:Nc] and make similar adjustments for other halo fillings to minimize confusion. Please let me know your thoughts. My thoughts are two:. - how will we know that while doing that change you won't break anything since there is no test for any of these things. - I understand that you are telling me is merely an indexing reordering, that is instead of doing; ```julia; for j in 1:10; a[j] = 10; ```; you do; ```julia; for j in 2:11; a[j-1] = j-1; ```; right?

Testability,"> I over-simplified. FFTs are efficient when there are a small number of prime divisors --- 2, 3, 5, 7 --- of the length of the sample. 100 may actually be ok because it is 2*2*5*5. I don't feel strongly, but you will find that most people running simulations are using powers of 2 and 3 (128, 192, 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024) --- even when their code has no FFTs! Perhaps the purpose of this convention is so people who _do_ use codes that rely _heavily_ on FFTs are able to run code comparisons. I find the convention to be an appropriate best practice. An 1D FFT of length 257, for example, is 4 times slower than an FFT of length 256 on my machine. For tests, of course, using small numbers of prime divisors is completely irrelevant; I just want to encourage best practices and promote awareness of them, and also implicitly emphasize to users that this code uses FFTs, and don't want random person X to read the tests and scratch their head and ask ""doesn't this code rely on FFTs?"" (like I did when I saw the examples). I don't disagree with anything here. I just think users should be able to run using whatever resolution they want and know that the code has been tested and works with weird inefficient resolutions. To encourage users maybe we can print a ""performance warning"" if the grid resolution is not the product of a small number of prime divisors?. > I certainly prefer that.

We're missing many of the horizontal metrics too so I think we should add those, otherwise `Flat` won't work with curvilinear grids, either. EDIT: definitions for flat _area_ metrics are probably not very useful / represent edge cases that need special consideration. So we might just focus on flat _linear_ metrics for now (dx, dy at various locations). Right now additional horizontal linear metrics are irrelevant because there are no rectilinear grids that are stretched in horizontal directions. However, we will need these once we have general stretched rectilinear grids and it might be good to avoid confusion like what's happening in the present issue...

My intuition from seeing results from papers (and from previous LES+IBM at my previous group) is that partial step cells would be almost as accurate as shaved cells (at least for oceanic cases with mild bathymetry slopes) but significantly simpler to implement. Since we already have the full-cell grid-fitted IBM it might be better to just focus on that for now and later modify it to make it partial-step when everything is working well (I think we'd just need to modify the calculation of vertical areas and volumes, no?).

I often find myself spending way longer on PRs than I initially anticipate so I'm generally not very good at assessing these things lol. ok ok! Here's a rule of thumb: a bugfix or refactor is the least committment, because you can get away with no new tests or docs. A new _feature_ takes more time because of documentation. One should expect to spend most of their time on docs and tests. If you're spending a lot of time implementing a feature, then either the feature is very complicated / hard, or your workflow can use some improvement. Among new features, different types of features require different amount of effort. This case is one of the easier cases --- it's extending functionality without changing existing functionality, also its fairly niche (at this point) so simple documentation will suffice. The work required to test the feature also has already been partially completed (the script you posted). Other features, like adding new _physics_ will take much longer, because often you'll have to run a full validation case + analysis to assess whether things work as expected. So even if the source code change is small to implement new physics, the validation will take a while and dominate the development effort. If a new feature also requires changing existing functionality / refactoring, that's going to take the most amount of time, because you will probably also have to change existing tests.

I don't really see why it makes user specification more complicated. The discussion is purely about how the user API communicates and organizes information. I would argue that it's logical or clear to ""classify"" a radiating boundary condition as an ""open boundary condition"", because radiating boundary conditions imply that there is a non-trivial external state outside the prognostic domain. This differs from `Value` or `Gradient` which communicate the notion of either a solid wall or fixed external state. The alternative propose is to get rid of `Open` entirely, which we could do. That would be a ""flatter"" design. I think that a possible user workflow might involve 1) deciding what boundary conditions are ""Open"" versus not, and _then_ 2) deciding how to treat the open boundary numerically / physically.

The canonical way to do it apparently is to flatten the array, sort it, and then put it back into the original shape.

Are you producing a lot of 3D time averages (which can't be constructed in post-processing?) We've attempted to design the code so that reductions can be performed with minimal memory allocation. 3D diagnostics can simply be calculated from snapshots of the model state, so there's no need to allocate memory (assuming that static memory greatly exceeds GPU memory, this would be preferred). Are we missing a feature to help reduce memory requirements of diagnostics perhaps?. That's interesting. I'm actually also performing a significant amount of 3D averages, as you picked up on. The reason for that is because I want them at a higher frequency than the 3D snapshots that I'm outputting. I'd need a lot of disk-space to output the 3D fields at such high frequencies, so it's a storage limitation issue.

I recently tried the 1 degree setup (switching to v0.75.3 of Oceananigans) and saw that there are still stability issues. Given that the solution blows up within 10 iterations it's probably more worthwhile to use the CPU for debugging purposes. It took 50 minutes to precompile on the GPU with TEOS10 + GM + Biharmonic viscosity + Vertical Diffusivity + Convective Adjustment. Also, the CPU is pretty fast at 1 deg resolution! I was able to do 30 day runs. So we may only need GPU for production runs. @sandreza how did you test on the latest Oceananigans? It looks like `main` isn't merged here but needs to be.

If we want more challenging tests, there are no shortage of those. Lots of tests have shocks and people like to test those but I would suggest avoiding those, as shocks mean the aspect ratio is order one or larger, and that violates the underyling hydrostatic assumption in the model. We could take the Bicklet jet example we have and put it over topography and compute the growth rates. There is a Poulin and Flierl (2005) in JPO that studies that and it would be easy enough to put to get linear stability code to compute the growth rates. That way we also have some theory to support the code. Also, we could look at a wind-driven gyre problem with and without topography.

Testability,"> Just a question about implementation:; > ; > It looks like #2538 implemented just one solver, with an optional tridiagonal component, is that right. Why does this PR take a different approach? Wouldn't using a single solver result in less code / duplication of transform logic?. Here, the approach follows the serial implementation quite closely, where we have an FFT solver and a FourierTridiagonal solver. Additionally, the fields of the solvers are tailored to their task; for example, there is no tridiagonal solver in the pure FFT solver. You might argue that we just put nothing if we don't need it, but then we have more ""ambiguous"" fields like eigenvalues that are not needed in the tridiagonal solver and source_term that is not needed in the FFT. I am not convinced that a single solver would lead to less (or cleaner) code. Mostly because the underlying code (constructor and `solve!` functions) is compact and slender enough to justify writing individual functions for different grids (the number of lines in the docstring for the `DistributedFourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver` is comparable to the code related to the solver). I think this improves the interpretability of the algorithm. Maybe an improvement would be writing a unified constructor that would spit out the different solvers. > 2. It might make sense to split the constructor into two parts, so that we can build a tridiagonal solver even when all three directions are regular. That could be useful for testing, for example. . I have added this capability by passing the `stretched_direction` kwarg. > Also note that in terms of operation count the tridiagonal solve is cheaper than FFT... I think, all things considered, the mixed FFT / tridiagonal solve will have basically the same computational cost as the pure FFT solve only for a stretched x direction. The additional transposes required for a y or stretched z direction will completely dominate the cost of the actual operations.

Testability,"> My primitive logic: for a flux boundary condition, bc.calc() ""calculates"" the flux at the given grid point and time-step. For a ""value"" boundary condition, bc.calc() ""calculates"" the value of the boundary condition at the given grid point and time-step. But I agree it is a weird name. What is a better name?. It may not stand up to mathematical rigor but I still like `bc.impose()`. In your two examples, I feel like a flux is being _imposed_ and a value is being _imposed_. If `bc.calc()` calculates a number then it should be used as; ```julia; something = bc.calc(args...); ```; while `bc.impose` should be used like; ```julia; bc.impose!(args...); ```.

Testability,"> Nice work! I'm curious about the criteria. Should it be something like; > ; > ```julia; > dt = 10 * eps(dt) * sim.dt; > ```; > ; > ? Or does it have to be larger than that (hence the factor 1e10). I actually don't know what the proper criterion should be. With the one you proposed, the error doesn't go away in this example since the tiny time-step is about `1e-12`, but `10 * eps(dt) * sim.dt` come out to be about `1e-13`. If we use `100 * eps(dt) * sim.dt` then it works. But I don't yet know how much of this will generalize to other, more complex simulations.

Plus, we want users to be able to provide custom schedules (since they only need to be a function of `model` that returns true/false) so that people can trigger output / action using interesting custom criteria... Yeah, agree. I'm not sure of a good workaround here though. Do you have suggestions?. For the time being we can just set a fallback method as `next_actuation_time(scheduke) = Inf` I guess?

In terms of _reading_ these code statements I much prefer seeing `pressure_solver = poisson_solver`. Its even pedagogical because it teaches you that we solve the Poisson equation for pressure. I love that and that is exactly why we chose this design. Please bear with me to understand the reason I am proposing this change. In practical usage / when coding new experiments it is easy to mix up ""pressure"" with ""poisson"". I've been working testing lots of different solvers these past few days, and keep accidentally typing `pressure_solver = ConjugateGradientPressureSolver(grid)` which is wrong. If it becomes more common to configure the pressure / poisson solver in the future (because we have better support for different solvers for irregular geometries) then I would like to also help others that may run into this issue. It's nice to have syntax that ""rolls of the tongue"", ie, is what you would type if you were typing without concentrating very hard. It's not big deal either.

Interesting. I don't believe we make any attempt to manage GPU memory. However, the tests are all quite lightweight (the largest are probably the regression tests, at 16^3?) The GPU we use for CI has 24 GB total memory. Up to 16 jobs can run simultaneously.

Testability,"> So it seems that our model has an extra degree of freedom that neither Lilly nor Pressel propose. Quite! Though Lilly admits that his model amounts to ""little more than a scaling argument"" and that both `Pr_t` and the model ""constant"" are themselves unknown functions. So I actually think there is room to interpret Lilly as proposing a whole family of models. Since time is finite only one has been tested I guess (and also the structure of the model is questionable, so people have moved on to other formulations...). > I propose we either get rid of `C_b` and just use `1/Pr_t` or make it clear in the docs and docstring that we offer an extra degree of freedom, but that the model as proposed has `C_b=1/Pr_t`. I'm not sure which one is best since I do like the idea of Oceananigans allowing for easy (customization), but also that favors mistakes by un-attentive users (such as myself haha). Does the default `Cb = 1/Pr` both retain flexibility and also reduce the chances of unexpected behavior / mistakes?. If we get rid of `Cb` then we may want to introduce an alternative way to eliminate the buoyancy correction entirely (currently achievable with `Cb=0`). A further caveat is that using `1/Pr` only applies if `Pr` is the same for all tracers and if a linear equation of state links tracers to buoyancy. With nonlinear equations of state it's unclear what to use for `Cb`. I believe we also allow a different `Pr` for every tracer. In this case the default `Cb=1/Pr` will throw an error (probably a good thing, since you'd have to decide what to use for `Cb` in this case).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1908#issuecomment-889333799:402,test,tested,402,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1908#issuecomment-889333799,2,['test'],['tested']

Testability,"> So what do you guys think if this tilting is implement at the AbstractBuoyancy level? If I understand correctly all buoyancy types inherit that, right? That way we'd have a keyword for the tilt (maybe tilt, gravitational_direction or gravity_projection) that would default to (0, 0, 1) and a similar option could be given to FPlane, avoiding confusion. Ah, the issue is that abstract types cannot have properties --- they can only be used to organize type parameters and dispatch.; The logic and motivation of your suggestion is sound though (avoiding code duplication through good design); we just have to come up with a different solution. A similar solution could perhaps design a more hierarchical interface to `IncompressibleModel.buoyancy`. For example, we might write. ```julia; struct Buoyancy{G, B}; gravitational_direction :: G; model :: B; end; ```. The existing subtypes of `AbstractBuoyancy` are used for `Buoyancy.model`. The user API could be. ```julia; buoyancy = Buoyancy(gravitational_direction=(0.1, 0, 0.9), model=BuoyancyTracer()); ```. or. ```julia; buoyancy = Buoyancy(gravitational_direction=(0.1, 0, 0.9),; model=SeawaterBuoyancy(gravitational_acceleration=9.81, equation_of_state=LinearEquationOfState(α=2e-4, β=8e-5))); ```. This is more verbose but could avoid some of the issues that @tomchor sees. As for `Plane` and `BetaPlane`, I agree that those models are really predicated on a thin aspect ratio assumption that has to do with gravitational accelerations, and therefore ""know"" about the direction of gravity. We could either add a property `gravitational_direction` or, perhaps, add some wrapper / helper functions for constructing coriolis forces in tilted domains (eg `coriolis = TiltedCoriolisForces(FPlane(f=1e-4), vertical_direction=(0.1, 0.0, 0.9))` which returns `GeneralCoriolis` with 3D Coriolis forces --- or something).

Testability,"> Thanks @jagoosw and @glwagner for your thoughts on this. @glwagner, the approach to nesting is going to be highly dependent on the particular case. The nesting strategy for a simulation with mesoscale eddies passing across the boundary will be very different from the strategy to nest an LES inside a low resolution simulation. I think that this PR should provide different types of boundary conditions (the 'ingredients') and the user will need to decide how to use them for their particular case (the 'recipe' which will rely on different combinations of the 'ingredients').

Testability,"> This is great, thanks @glwagner and @iuryt! Si Chen has been testing the code with a buouyant tracer added through forcing like this and he is running a comparison with Jenny Dingwall's simulations with Diablo. The extra `slip' velocity needs to vanish at the boundaries in order to conserve tracer, but then adding the advection term to the RHS forcing like @glwagner suggested seems to work and conserves tracer. We did something like this: . ```julia; lambda = 1 # decay scale for slip velocity in meters; for k=0:Nz+2; slip_vel.w[:,:,k].+=(tanh(max(-grid.zᵃᵃᶠ[k]/lambda,0))*tanh(max((grid.zᵃᵃᶠ[k]+Lz)/lambda,0))); end; ```. Makes sense!. Since there's a `dw/dz`, this means that the ""additional"" velocity field has divergence and thus tracer still not exactly conserved, right? But perhaps the divergence is small enough that it's almost conserved. Should we implement the advection differently (ie not using flux form) so that it's correct even when the velocity field is divergent? Another possibility is to have a flag, something like. ```julia; forcing = AdvectiveForcing(w=prescribed_w, flux_form=true); ```. Or, perhaps `divergent=true`, or something like that.

Testability,"> This is great, though I'm wondering what it's role in the Oceananigans code base is. Is the intention to remove these bits once WENO is actually implemented in the code?. Yeah so the point of this PR was to test the WENO operators independently of Oceananigans.jl (also to play around with how advection schemes interact with different time steppers). The WENO operators were coded so that we can readily integrate them with the existing operators in `tracer_advection_operators`. So when an advection scheme abstraction is implemented and `weno.jl` is integrated into the main code, `verification/tracer_advection_1d/tracer_advection_1d.jl` can be converted into an Oceananigans.jl verification experiment. Right now it's just a WENO-5 verification experiment. > Why not?. Ah sorry I wasn't clear.

A flag called `separate_hydrostatic_pressure` that takes `true`/`false` would be much more intuitive, although we'd need a little more code. Should we prioritize user-friendliness here?. This is more flexible, because sometimes users want to have access to the pressure field prior to model construction. If we use a flag, then we either can't support that or have to put some annoying logic in the constructor. Since I feel it'll be rare that people want to change this kwarg, I think the trade-offs work out that its better to have a simpler constructor even if those rare users that want to separate hydrostatic pressure have to build `CenterField`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3574#issuecomment-2088676711:541,log,logic,541,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3574#issuecomment-2088676711,2,['log'],['logic']

Testability,"> Update: I used the formulas in the paper to approximate the gradient of pressure. In a test case that is pressure dominated, I found that the accuracy imporoved by more than what the theory predicted (> 16), but that is very encouraging that we are doing something right. Note that ""4th-order"" refers to the rate of convergence of the scheme as the grid spacing is reduced. For a particular resolution (and assuming that you are in the ""asymptotic regime of convergence""), the improvement gained from higher-order scheme involves both the rate of convergence / slope of the error estimate as well as a constant (the intercept) that's specific to the problem. As a result, you usually don't have a theoretical prediction for improvement at fixed resolution, I don't think (though I suppose you might be able to generate an estimate if you are differentiating a function with easily knowable properties). Empirically we usually find that higher-order schemes reduce the constant by quite a bit! Which is good --- since we often run marginally resolved problems, improving the constant (rather than the slope/rate of convergence) turns out to be the most important benefit of a high-order scheme. The plot is super busy, but the point is hopefully illustrated: higher-order advection schemes not only converge _more quickly_ to the exact solution as resolution is increased (eg, the slopes of the lines are steeper) but _also_ have reduced error at a _fixed_ resolution (eg, the error is less for WENO5 than CenteredSecondOrder at the fixed resolution 2^7):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/101667154-fba01600-3a1c-11eb-824e-f3ec82367229.png)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1266#issuecomment-741942088:89,test,test,89,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1266#issuecomment-741942088,1,['test'],['test']

Here are some numbers that I think bring some clarity:. - Using Julia 1.6 and Oceananigans 0.77.5:; - Biggest grid I can run: `997×997×96 ImmersedBoundaryGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on GPU with 4×4×4 halo`; - Memory usage right after building `model`: 19712MiB / 32768MiB; - Memory usage right before running and after adding simulation and diagnostics: 25778MiB / 32768MiB; - Using Julia 1.7 and Oceanaigans 0.78.0:; - Biggest grid I can run: `941×941×90 ImmersedBoundaryGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on GPU with 4×4×4 halo`; - Memory usage right after building `model`: 16576MiB / 32768MiB; - Memory usage right before running and after adding simulation and diagnostics: 31026MiB / 32768MiB; - Using Julia 1.8 and Oceanaigans 0.78.0:; - Biggest grid I can run: `941×941×90 ImmersedBoundaryGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on GPU with 4×4×4 halo`; - Memory usage right after building `model`: 16576MiB / 32768MiB; - Memory usage right before running and after adding simulation and diagnostics: 31026MiB / 32768MiB. Note that although Julia 1.6 + Oceananigans 0.77 ends up with the smaller memory usage in the end, it apparently uses a lot of temporary allocations because I get an out-of-memory error when adding diagnostics with bigger grids. That said, it still manages to have the smallest ""permanent"" memory usage and allows me to run larger simulations. Interesting results.

There are a LOT of choices between e.g. `512x512x128` and `1024x1024x128`. It might be that the largest model that fits in memory isn't nice powers of 2. Users may have various reasons for running resolutions that aren't powers of 2. I over-simplified. FFTs are efficient when there are a small number of prime divisors --- 2, 3, 5, 7 --- of the length of the sample. 100 may actually be ok because it is 2\*2\*5\*5. I don't feel strongly, but you will find that most people running simulations are using powers of 2 and 3 (128, 192, 256, 384, 512, 768, 1024) --- even when their code has no FFTs! Perhaps the purpose of this convention is so people who *do* use codes that rely *heavily* on FFTs are able to run code comparisons. I find the convention to be an appropriate best practice. An 1D FFT of length 257, for example, is 4 times slower than an FFT of length 256 on my machine. For tests, of course, using small numbers of prime divisors is completely irrelevant; I just want to encourage best practices and promote awareness of them, and also implicitly emphasize to users that this code uses FFTs, and don't want random person X to read the tests and scratch their head and ask ""doesn't this code rely on FFTs?""

Testability,"> Yes, that seems promising! For some problems of that nature we have recommended that people write functions to interpolate their discrete data, since one can then change resolution seamlessly... but perhaps there's a case where writing an interpolator doesn't make sense or is too cumbersome for a simple setup. 🤔. Writing an interpolator function would certainly be the most elegant way but some user might already be used to other regridding tools (like nco) and would prefer to read in some fields?. A simple fun example for using array inputs:. Prepare a tracer field by backward advecting the attached image or a logo in a Stommel gyre. Save the distorted image and now prepare the example using this distorted image as the initial condition for a forward advection :-).

Testability,"> Yes, this simulation is a bit underresolved I think. Increasing ν would definitely help.

I'd need to increase the number of points too and then it would be too costly of a simulation for a docs example.; > ; > This also depends on the philosophy behind the docs examples. Do we want them to be simulations that absolutely hold scientific scrutiny from all fronts? If so then yeah, I should probably make it better-resolved. I see the docs example as having some wiggle room, though, as long as it teaches users something valuable. But that's obviously up for debate. I think underresolution is ok; many of the examples are underresolved, mostly because we want them to be cheap. The docs examples (in my opinion) are to demonstrate code functionality; eg give users the tools and inspiration they need to set up their own experiments. . A great docs example does go above and beyond and also includes lessons about physics, style and scripting practices, and creative uses of the code.

Testability,"> that looks very weird! But it is structured in some sense, it looks like the initial condition has some inbalances that generate noise which gets cleaned up by numerical diffusion. Interesting also that buoyancy extrema are continuously increasing in magnitude. If this is not happening with z-directed gravity, it might really be that there is some bug/incorrectness in the buoyancy model. A way to test this would be to recreate the same setup with z-directed gravity and use an immersed boundary to represent the tilt. If that case behaves as expected we know where to focus. @simone-silvestri I'm not sure if that'd be an apples-to-apples comparison. We'd be comparing a domain with smooth tilted boundaries (using the rotated buoyancy) against a domain with jagged tilted boundaries (using our grid-fitted IB). So I'm not sure what we could learn there (please lmk if I'm missing something here).

Testability,">I think that the problem is that we are passing an integer and not an array. I disagree and let me clarify my statement that ""the test uses incorrect syntax"". We are testing topologies that are both two- and three-dimensional, but using syntax to construct `VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid` that is _only valid for three-dimensional topologies_. To see this, take a look at the `vs_topos` we test:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/365d00d61d8a73171a7b89712a8629694cad2388/test/test_poisson_solvers.jl#L257-L266. this list includes two-dimensional topologies like `(Flat, Bounded, Bounded)` (two-dimensional in `y-z`). However, when we construct `VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid` we write. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/365d00d61d8a73171a7b89712a8629694cad2388/test/test_poisson_solvers.jl#L140. which only works if there is no `Flat` dimension. . For example, if the topology is `(Flat, Bounded, Bounded)`, then our syntax should be. ```julia; vs_grid = VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid(FT, architecture=arch, topology=topo, size=(Ny, Nz), y=(0, 1), zF=zF); ```.

Testability,">On #1962 we add bars capability, which will allow us to separate the tests into a few categories: fast-running, crucial tests will run on every commit to a PR, and slower, more comprehensive integration tests will run only when bors try or bors r+ is invoked. This might help streamline the development workflow. Also if we are using Caltech's central cluster for CI we can potentially split the jobs amongst more workers, which might help speed up tests overall. Definitely looking forward to that PR. > Even more important is simplifying the test implementation. Right now updating tests and validation experiments is a time sink for developers that change the API and has really slowed development down lately. So we shouldn't rewrite tests in a way that makes development more difficult (eg keeping the maintenance burden of the test infrastructure small is more important than decreasing the computational cost of tests). This is really a side comment --- we should be able to improve the tests both so they are faster and easier to maintain, if we are careful. I definitely agree with that.

Testability,"@ali-ramadhan @christophernhill it looks like the incompressible-in-time tests are failing for a hyperbolically `VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid`. However, a curious aspect of the test is that we compare `maximum(|δ|)` to 0, where `δ` is the divergence. Models that use `VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid` fail this test because `maximum(|δ|)` is greater than 5e-8 (its around 1e-4 for AdamsBashforth, and 3e-5 for RK3). . However, it looks like `sum(δ)` is smaller than machine precision; thus mass does not accumulate in time. . The larger-than-normal error only shows up when the grid is stretched; when the coordinate spacing in `VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid` is constant, the tests pass. Should we modify this test?

Then we can work on various FFT approaches on CPU and GPU (3-d FFT, 2-d + cyclic reduction), Greg's thought on saving for gradients in continuous form. . In principle the eigenvectors and eigenvalues above should correspond with amplitudes that come out of FFTW - except that there are a bunch of 1/2 factors, N versus m numbers, complex versus split cos/sin notation bits that need to be carefully understood etc.... .

Testability,"@christophernhill @glwagner @ali-ramadhan ; I obtained some interesting results from profiling the shallow water model running on GPU. This was done on Satori's login-002.; The gist of it is that varying gird sizes does not change GPU activities except when the grid size gets very small e.g. 128 x 128. All other grid resolutions profiled had about the same GPU activities result as shown below and so only one set is shown. As far as @francispoulin and I know, the GPU activities seem to be correct, with what should be taking up the most time doing so.; However, for API calls, results differ a lot based on grid resolution. As the grid increases in size, `cuStreamQuery` and eventually `cuCtxGetCurrent` becomes the dominant API call. See below the API call profile result tables for the different grid sizes. It seems that `cuStreamQuery` is what is checking on the status of the cuda streams so larger grids taking more time to run the kernels than launching the kernels may have something to do with it.; ```; Oceananigans v0.61.0; Julia Version 1.6.2; Commit 1b93d53fc4 (2021-07-14 15:36 UTC); Platform Info:; OS: Linux (powerpc64le-unknown-linux-gnu); CPU: unknown; WORD_SIZE: 64; LIBM: libopenlibm; LLVM: libLLVM-11.0.1 (ORCJIT, pwr9); GPU: Tesla V100-SXM2-32GB.

To answer your latest question --- our nonhydrostatic pressure solver is based on FFTs for regular grids and is therefore quite fast. In simple benchmarks long ago we found that other parts of the algorithm dominated the cost of a time-step. Because of that we aren't sure that having a hydrostatic-only solver would help. Of course, the story is different if we need to stretch the grid in horizontal directions. That said, it would still be interesting to be able to solve hydrostatic-only problems. This would complicate the algorithm a bit because you have to distinguish the barotropic mode, and perform a 2D pressure solve. We already have a function to integrate the buoyancy field to obtain the hydrostatic pressure. For ""things I want worked on"" my wish list falls into three categories: new physics features, new numerics / algorithms, and more boring software / UI work. Here's a couple... 1. Finishing the vertically-stretched grid implementation (numerics). We started work on this but its incomplete. This is a tricky and arduous task but would be quite nice to have... 2. Vertically-implicit time-stepping for diffusion terms (numerics). Ocean models typically use a time-stepping method that treats vertical diffusion terms implicitly. We haven't worried about this because we are focused on LES for the most part, or problems with very little diffusion. But ultimately we will need this, especially when we get around to implementing boundary layer closures. We have a tridiagonal solver that works on the GPU, so in some respects the hard work is already done for this problem. 3. Closures for LES and ocean modeling (Dynamic Smagorinsky, Deardorff, k-epsilon, Gent-McWilliams, convective adjustment (?) etc --- physics). We have a need to implement new turbulence closures new and old alike. Gent-McWilliams is probably easy since we already have a Leith closure implemented which calculates the tensor needed to rot",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1153#issuecomment-724262281:210,benchmark,benchmarks,210,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1153#issuecomment-724262281,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarks']

Testability,"@francispoulin @glwagner @ali-ramadhan @christophernhill ; I took a look at all the benchmarking scripts in our benchmarks folder and realized that many of them are very similar and can be unified. For example, the single script for shallow water model's strong and weak scaling differ only by one substring. ; The latest commit I pushed to this branch unifies all of the launcher and single scripts for shallow water model into three scripts. Now, at the top of the launcher script `distributed_shallow_water_model.jl`, there are two boolean variables that the user can toggle for strong vs weak scaling and mpi vs threaded parallel execution. Everything including output graphs, HTML tables, and info messages also change accordingly based on the two booleans. There are some other features that Francis and I have discussed but would like your approval first before adding them in.; Other possible additions to the script can include a for loop which wraps around the whole launcher script which loops through the strong/weak scaling and mpi/threaded parallelism options to allow for running 4 benchmarks at once. Another possible addition is to have what model is benchmarked also be an option. Granted, I could just copy and paste the shallow water model scripts and replace all instances of `shallow water` with `nonhydrostatic` or `hydrostatic` and tune some options a little bit, but then this would again cause avoidable clutter. Having what model is benchmarked as an easily changeable option can be achieved through a model setup function that dispatches what model is initialized based on a custom model type object that's passed to it.

Testability,"@francispoulin Ah 1.69 is how much slower `UpwindBiasedFifthOrder` is on the GPU instead of `CenteredSecondOrder` (also on the GPU). Below are the raw benchmarks and the CPU -> GPU speedups which show a speedup of ~114x for `UpwindBiasedFifthOrder` on 192^3 which should agree better with your figure of ~80x. Actually looking at the advection scheme benchmarks more closely it looks like WENO5 is incurring lots of CPU allocations. According to https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1169#issuecomment-725471594 changing the advection did not change the number of allocations, but now it does and WENO5 allocates much more memory than the other schemes. @glwagner I posted the turbulence closure benchmarks below and they seem fine/unchanged. ---. # Advection scheme benchmarks. ```; Advection scheme benchmarks ; ┌───────────────┬────────────────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬───────────┬────────┬─────────┐ ; │ Architectures │ Schemes │ min │ median │ mean │ max │ memory │ allocs │ samples │ ; ├───────────────┼────────────────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼───────────┼────────┼─────────┤ ; │ CPU │ CenteredFourthOrder │ 1.541 s │ 1.545 s │ 1.545 s │ 1.548 s │ 1.61 MiB │ 2096 │ 4 │ ; │ CPU │ CenteredSecondOrder │ 1.029 s │ 1.035 s │ 1.036 s │ 1.048 s │ 1.61 MiB │ 2096 │ 5 │ ; │ CPU │ UpwindBiasedFifthOrder │ 2.250 s │ 2.251 s │ 2.251 s │ 2.252 s │ 1.61 MiB │ 2096 │ 3 │ ; │ CPU │ UpwindBiasedThirdOrder │ 1.589 s │ 1.594 s │ 1.594 s │ 1.599 s │ 1.61 MiB │ 2096 │ 4 │ ; │ CPU │ WENO5 │ 6.339 s │ 6.339 s │ 6.339 s │ 6.339 s │ 1.61 MiB │ 2096 │ 1 │ ; │ GPU │ CenteredFourthOrder │ 17.309 ms │ 17.419 ms │ 18.107 ms │ 24.384 ms │ 2.71 MiB │ 27650 │ 10 │ ; │ GPU │ CenteredSecondOrder │ 10.369 ms │ 11.588 ms │ 11.472 ms │ 11.642 ms │ 2.53 MiB │ 16296 │ 10 │; │ GPU │ UpwindBiasedFifthOrder │ 19.561 ms │ 19.675 ms │ 20.975 ms │ 32.694 ms │ 2.77 MiB │ 32028 │ 10 │ ; │ GPU │ UpwindBiasedThirdOrder │ 16.131 ms │ 16.211 ms │ 16.8",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1764#issuecomment-868470173:151,benchmark,benchmarks,151,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1764#issuecomment-868470173,5,['benchmark'],['benchmarks']
Testability,"@francispoulin I do not know but I think it would be good to find out. `VerticallyImplicitTimeDiscretization`, despite being verbose, is actually too terse --- what we are really implementing is a _backwards_ vertically implicit time discretization. Our implementation in `QuasiAdamsBashforth2` is a first-order backwards approximation. Note that `QuasiAdamsBashforth2` is also first-order for explicit stepping, so this implementation should not change the accuracy of the scheme, I don't think. In `RungeKutta3` we implement a scheme that is backwards ""within stages"". This corresponds to some particular choice of Butcher tableau and I am not sure if it is formally 3rd order still. We might be able to develop a convergence test to an analytical solution to investigate this problem.

Testability,"@glwagner @tomchor ; I have just tested the turbulent boundary layer with wall model using Oceananigans on Julia 1.6.7 and Julia 1.9.2. The performances of AMD in both versions are exactly the same. It turns to overestimate the velocity shear at the second node from the wall, therefore, turns to overestimate the velocity in the middle and upper parts of the boundary layers. I used to use the SGS model based on the Lagrangian-averaged scale-dependent dynamic model (LASD) (https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/17/2/025105/895722/A-scale-dependent-Lagrangian-dynamic-model-for). @tomchor is very familiar with this SGS model.

Testability,"@glwagner I think I see what you mean now. It's definitely a harder problem than I anticipated. I think the ideal way would be to infer these conditions automatically, but like you said that may be a very hard problem. I don't think it's ill-posed, since you basically have all the necessary information in one way or another. So if I, a human, can arrive at the right answer with the same information, I think a program could do the same. Second best way would be to try infer the right BCs but provide an option to manually force a certain BC. I think inferring should be relatively easy in very simple cases, no? ~For example, in the pseudo-code below...~. ```julia. ... # Some code; UVelocityBoundaryConditions(grid, top = BoundaryCondition(Gradient, 0), bottom = BoundaryCondition(Gradient, 0),); ... # More code. dudz_comp = ComputedField(∂z(u)); compute!(dudz_comp); ```. ~This currently produces something with the wrong derivatives at the boundary, but I'd expect that it wouldn't be too hard to get this one right automatically since you basically have to do something similar to solve the Boussinesq equations. Am I wrong?~. Finally, I don't oppose relying completely on the user to provide the BCs for the ComputedFields like you said. Mostly I don't know the difference in the amount of effort between these options!

Testability,"@glwagner that sounds like a good strategy, ideally you would want to front-load the most useful tests for catching errors to the degree possible (the whole goal here is to reduce iteration time). If using Linux we can have up to 60 concurrent actions going so spawning as many as is useful for reducing the iteration time is the correct strategy (probably you could set this up as a job matrix for compactness). If spawning up a ton of github actions you can maximize concurrency by killing stale jobs (old push commits) as we do here: https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaCore.jl/blob/main/.github/workflows/Linux-UnitTests.yml#L24",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906584759:97,test,tests,97,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906584759,1,['test'],['tests']

There are quite a few things to double (triple) check. 1. **are you running on multiple GPUs?** ; There is some obscure foo for that here ( https://github.com/christophernhill/ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl/blob/5e4fd0698b7087467d9314bfa253d6bc9a09a40a/diffusion3D_multigpu_CuArrays_novis.jl#L21 ) that is not in Oceananigans or ImplicitGlobal as downloaded. Its not really particularly documented anywhere either (except in a blog post for this https://github.com/NVIDIA-developer-blog/code-samples/blob/master/posts/cuda-aware-mpi-example/src/CUDA_Aware_MPI.c as far as I can tell)! Without this bit you may end up running all ranks on the same GPU. The blog post here https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/benchmarking-cuda-aware-mpi/ gives a bit of background. . 2. **is there anything else running on the node when you test?** ; When I looked earlier in the week satori had become annoyingly busy. You need to request an exclusive node - and then wait unfortunately because of every else using. If you skip asking for exclusive you may end up sharing node - which is OK for getting work done, but confusing for benchmarking. . 3. **as @vchuravy mentions you may or may not be using messaging that goes direct GPU to GPU?** ; There is an issue with recent CUDA.jl that makes that hard (possibly not even possible). We are working to resolve that. @vchuravy has a suggested fix, but I found that caused other problems. The ImplicitGlobal team found @vchuravy fix to work, but with a very recent version of CUDA.jl where I think it isn't supposed to work - so they may have been mistaken.

The recommended syntax nowadays is, for example,. ```; bc = ValueBoundaryCondition(0); ```. rather than `BoundaryCondition(Value, 0)`. This change was made to avoid name conflicts with some common names in the Julia ecosystem (like `Flux`). But, it looks like the validation script was not updated when this change was made to our exported names. I opened a PR to fix it in #1982. You can fix the script yourself as well by replacing `BoundaryCondition(Value, ` with `ValueBoundaryCondition(`.

Testability,"@jakebolewski I'm wondering what you think about the strategy of running a few key integration tests via GitHub actions, in addition perhaps to unit tests that have low compilation costs. For example, we have a couple ""regression tests"" that ensure the output of a simulation is identical to one run previously. These regression tests are imprecise (we only know that something has changed, but can't identify exactly what it is), but nevertheless catch both obvious API bugs and subtle numerics bugs incurred by refactoring. Another nice feature is that regression tests invoke (or are supposed to invoke) configurations that are most common / most valuable to users. They are also relatively cheap since we load states from a file and run for 10-100 time-steps at modest resolutions, and there are a small number of them which mitigates compilation cost. When I undertake a major refactor I often find myself running regression tests first. Testing corner cases and/or catching bugs associated with interactions between model components in less-frequently used configurations requires more extensive testing (a combinatorial explosion of cases...) and incurs heavier compilation costs; so these are probably better tested via `bors try`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906570444:95,test,tests,95,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906570444,9,"['Test', 'test']","['Testing', 'tested', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"@jmbeckers thanks for the delucidation! Indeed, a conservative discretization might be more ""natural"" (have better discrete properties) in terms of momentum conservation. Especially because vector invariant formulations do not conserve momentum but angular momentum. @francispoulin, indeed, I think that, for a one layer model explicit dissipation might not be necessary because the noise associated with a horizontal velocity divergence is encoded in the mass equation which is discretized with a WENO formulation also (another way of repeating what @glwagner said). This is the difference with the hydrostatic model where we do not explicitly evolve a prognostic equation for the vertical velocity and we have to explicitly damp the noise contained in the vertical velocity `w` through a divergence damping closure. So you can think at that ""divergence damping"" closure as a ""WENO"" for an hypothetical `w` equation (which we have in the shallow water equations explicitly trough `h`). I agree also that we should introduce a diffusion term anyways. It is always good to be able to quickly quantify the dissipation you have in your model and with implicit dissipation that is very difficult (implicit LES is frowned upon by many purist of turbulence). for the documentation problem I think it's just because I changed the example.

Testability,"@navidcy PyPlot is used for the log2 scale for the x-axis of certain graphs. The normal backend of Plots,jl only has natural log scale axis option. Log-base-2 scale works best for these plots since most of them have an independent variable that scales based on powers of 2. The inclusion of Oceananigans in `benchmark/Project.toml` is likely due to a Julia package config suggested by @ali-ramadhan. What was done was that in Julia's package manager, `dev ..` was inputted to enable what I assume is the dev version of the Oceananigans package folder. Before this was done, there were numerous output errors with the benchmark scripts, and doing so fixes them all.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1746#issuecomment-864599629:125,log,log,125,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1746#issuecomment-864599629,4,"['Log', 'benchmark', 'log']","['Log-base-', 'benchmark', 'log']"
Testability,"@navidcy Thanks for the feedback. I added a docstring for `aligned_time_step` that explains its purpose:. ```; aligned_time_step(sim). Returns a time step Δt that is aligned with the output writer schedules and stop time of the simulation `sim`.; The purpose of aligning the time step is to ensure simulations do not time step beyond the `sim.stop_time` and; to ensure that output is written at the exact time specified by the output writer schedules.; ```. ---. > 1. Why does `aligned_time_step(sim)` return a negative time-step? Is this a bug? ; > 2. Why is this fix temporary? What would a more permanent fix look like?; > ; > It seems that aligning the time-step is causing a host of issues. Is this the real problem? Should we stop aligning time-steps until we are sure that we can do it safely?. @glwagner Sorry I thought I explained the issue in #1280 but looks like I didn't. The problem has to do with checkpointing and pickup when output writers are using `TimeInterval` schedules. Output writer schedules are not checkpointed so when you pickup a simulations that includes output writers with `TimeInterval` schedules, the `model.clock` is restored but the `schedule.previous_actuation_time` is 0 for all `TimeInterval` schedules. So `aligned_time_step` thinks it needs to take a negative time step as it needs to write output at t = `schedule.time_interval`. The permanent fix is to checkpoint and pickup schedules (properly fixing #1280) which would prevent `aligned_time_step` from returning negative time steps. I see this as more of a checkpointing issue than a time step alignment issue. In general we are not extensively testing checkpointing.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1303#issuecomment-766101050:1639,test,testing,1639,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1303#issuecomment-766101050,2,['test'],['testing']

Testability,"@navidcy it shouldn't impact developer workflow too much. When going over the test structure with @glwagner on Tues. I suggested the following restructuring:. * Break-out ""quick"" unit-tests to be run by github actions under a single configuration (ex: linux, julia 1.6) and be able to run them in parallel. We have a ""Team"" account donated by Github so we can have tons of concurrent GitHub actions so this is beneficial if you can take advantage (might be limited by compilation costs). These tests will be run for every PR push and fast fail on error.; * `bors try` trigger a more expensive CI job to be submitted to the cluster, allowing for GPU / MPI tests. The logic here is that if the cpu tests are not working then the GPU tests almost certainly won't so you can get away with executing them less often. We have a daemon running on the cluster that synchronizes the jobs from buildkite with the local slurm controller, so every step in the buildkite config is submitted as a separate slurm job and canceling buildkite jobs kills them with slum. What is nice about that setup is you can tailor the resources used for each buildkite step just as you would slurm (ex. ""gres:1"" for 1 gpu). You can run jobs on multiple ranks, multiple GPU's, different resource limits, timeouts, etc. basically anything you can pass through to as a cli argument to a slurm batch job is supported. Also it's running on a cluster so obviously your job parallelism is very good.; * `bors r+` trigger merging the PR into `main` branch. This serializes the commits to `main` (and roll-up concurrent PR's to be submitted) so that all merge commits will pass the tests. This is an opportunity to also maybe run more expensive tests (it's easy in buildkite to conditionally run steps if running on `staging` branch) because you'll probably only run the staging CI step one or at most a few times at the very end,. the general strategy is to tier the tests so that they get progressively more expensive and to maximize ci-p",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906541778:78,test,test,78,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906541778,7,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'test', 'tests']"

But if we were to allow for a rigid-lid `ShallowWaterModel`, then we could test the exact solution in the context of this model where momentum evolves. I realize this is a multi-step process, but I for one have wanted to have a rigid lid shallow water model, and this would help to make it happen, as well as create a nice sandbox to test our advection schemes with a classical problem.

Testability,"@tomchor . In terms of ""smoothness indicators"" yes, not in terms of polynomial reconstruction. The WENO we had before is `WENO5()`. This will be formally wrong on a stretched grid because the reconstruction at the face is not done accounting for variable spacing. . `WENO5(grid = grid, stretched_smoothness=false) ` accounts for variable spacing in the reconstruction polynomial (i.e., the <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=c_{rj}""> coefficients are calculated based on grid spacing). This makes the scheme formally correct as, independently on how you weight the polynomials, the different stencils will have mathematically correct reconstructions at the face. This should _always_ be done in case of a stretched grid (and it does not decrease execution speed). Now, the `stretched_smoothness=true` calculates the <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_{r}""> accounting for a stretched mesh. This means that the three reconstruction polynomials (<img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=p_{0}, p_{1}, p_{2}"">) are weighted accounting for their actual smoothness and not a ""uniform smoothness"" that `WENO5(grid = grid, stretched_smoothness=false) ` calculates. In my tests this did not give a noticeable benefit in terms of accuracy (apparently <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_{r}""> for a stretched mesh are very similar to <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta_{r}""> for a uniform mesh). In addition, it gives a non-negligible decrease in execution speed (especially on the GPU).

Testability,"@tomchor After this PR, I believe there are no issues.; Except we currently have to manually adjust the actuation to match the correct value based on the pre-pickup simulation during setup. ; For example, we have to do something like this: ; ```julia; # Run a simulation that saves data to a checkpoint; simulation = test_simulation(T1, Δt, window_nΔt, interval_nΔt, stride, true); run!(simulation); checkpointed_wta = simulation.output_writers[:single_output_time_average].outputs[""c1""]; checkpointed_actuations = checkpointed_wta.schedule.actuations. # Now try again, but picking up from the previous checkpoint; N = iteration(simulation); checkpoint = ""test_iteration$N.jld2""; simulation = test_simulation(T2, Δt, window_nΔt, interval_nΔt, stride, false); simulation.output_writers[:single_output_time_average].outputs[""c1""].schedule.actuations = checkpointed_actuations; run!(simulation, pickup=checkpoint); ```. The point is to ensure that the actuation after the pickup matches the actuation value from before the checkpoint.; ```julia; simulation.output_writers[:single_output_time_average].outputs[""c1""].schedule.actuations = checkpointed_actuations; ```.

For example:. ```; N² * g̃[2] = 8.660254037844387e-6, mean(∂y_b) = 8.660254037844065e-6, Δ = 3.2187251995663413e-19 at t = 1 hour with θ=60; N² * g̃[3] = 5.0e-6, mean(∂z_b) = 5.00000000000176e-6, Δ = -1.7592874314471818e-18 at t = 1 hour with θ=60; N² * g̃[2] = 8.660254037844387e-6, mean(∂y_b) = 8.660130013623816e-6, Δ = 1.2402422057088938e-10 at t = 10 hours with θ=60; N² * g̃[3] = 5.0e-6, mean(∂z_b) = 5.000172734522595e-6, Δ = -1.7273452259476338e-10 at t = 10 hours with θ=60. ```. I guess the difference is still pretty small and this is a coarse 2D testing setup with low-order numerics, but it does grow quite a bit. Is this something to be worried about for turbulent simulations? I wonder if it's worth making a movie to see what happens after 10-100+ hours. I think all tests should pass now so we could probably start using tilted gravity more seriously!

Testability,"@tomchor this is the report from Shu deriving ENO coefficients for a finite volume scheme https://www3.nd.edu/~zxu2/acms60790S13/Shu-WENO-notes.pdf (In particular equation 2.20 which becomes equation 2.21 for uniform grids and reduces to the coefficient we used before) I can add some documentation on the WENO. .

This is just a quick fix to try out the new Oceananigans. ; Also, to try out if the problem persists it is enough to test some simple second-order moments. ; The ones you have in your script should do the job; ```; u, v, w = model.velocities; t = model.tracers.T. U = Average(u, dims=(1, 2)) ; V = Average(v, dims=(1, 2)); T = Average(t, dims=(1, 2)); wu = Average(w * u, dims=(1, 2)); wv = Average(w * v, dims=(1, 2)); uu = Average(u * u, dims=(1, 2)); vv = Average(v * v, dims=(1, 2)); ww = Average(w * w, dims=(1, 2)); www = Average(w * w * w, dims=(1, 2)); wT = Average(w * t, dims=(1, 2)); uv = Average(u * v, dims=(1, 2)); uT = Average(u * t, dims=(1, 2)); vT = Average(v * t, dims=(1, 2)); TT = Average(t * t, dims=(1, 2)); ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2766#issuecomment-1266331571:409,test,test,409,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2766#issuecomment-1266331571,2,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Also to elaborate a bit: file extensions are _always_ arbitrary.

I don't believe there are any simple tests that `Value` / `Gradient` boundary conditions are imposed correctly --- even without an immersed boundary. Instead, we have relied on validation tests to check that. I think it does make sense though to have some tests in that direction... maybe something like a test that 1D couette flow is maintained (for momentum) and that a simple linear tracer gradient is maintained (for tracers). Those would go here: https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/glw/immersed-bcs/test/test_dynamics.jl. Since we don't have that yet we should probably add in another PR.

Testability,"Anyways, I don't quite see it but that could be the issue. So we can try replacing. ```julia; # Reset the ""previous"" interval time, subtracting a sliver that presents overshoot from accumulating. ; wta.schedule.previous_interval_stop_time = model.clock.time - rem(model.clock.time, wta.schedule.interval) ; ```. with. ```julia; if model.clock.time == wta.schedule.previous_interval_stop_time + wta.schedule.interval; wta.schedule.previous_interval_stop_time = model.clock.time; else; # Reset the ""previous"" interval time, subtracting a sliver that presents overshoot from accumulating. ; wta.schedule.previous_interval_stop_time = model.clock.time - rem(model.clock.time, wta.schedule.interval); end; ```.

Testability,"As far as I can tell the main purpose of `CLIMAParameters` is to provide a central / global place to specify common parameters found in different model components. For example, `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` has a `gravitational_acceleration` for both `buoyancy` and `free_surface`. On the other hand, it turns out that it's sometimes convenient for these to be different for testing and experimentation, which may impose additional requirements on `CLIMAParameters` that were not part of the original design. One possible solution might be to build a global `CLIMAParameters` instance in `Oceananigans` that's referenced in model constructors for default parameter values (but we can still let users change parameters when instantiating various model components if they want). A possible goal of CLIMAParameters is to _restrict_ the user interface so that users ""can't mess up""; eg users can't accidentally set `gravitational_acceleration` in `free_surface` and erroneously expect that this also changes `gravitational_acceleration` for buoyancy.

Testability,"As the diff shows, this PR reconstructs buoyancy at the location it's needed. For example, `x_dot_g_b` must reconstruct the buoyancy perturbation, which is located at tracer locations `ccc`, at the location `fcc`. . Similarly, `z_dot_g_b` should be reconstructed at `ccf` (the location of vertical velocity). Note that we _also_ do this reconstructed when computing the hydrostatic pressure integral, therefore:. $$ p_h = \int^0_z \bar b^z \text{ } dz $$. where $\overline{()}^z$ indicates a reconstruction in $z$. Previously, we were assuming within the hydrsotatic pressure integral that `z_dot_g_b` returned at `ccc`. The first commit on this PR changed the reconstruction for `z_dot_g_b` so it returns at `ccf`. However, making this change also requires ""undoing"" the reconstruction in the hyrostatic pressure integral, which previously assumed that `z_dot_g_b` returned at `ccc`. With both changes, the regression tests should pass _and_ tilted gravity should be fixed.

Testability,"Can we just compare 1) the topology and 2) all of the nodes? I think that would be sufficient to determine equality. I'm worried if we don't explicitly check the topology that we might run into some edge cases where the nodes / spacings are the same but the topologies are different (these would possibly be pathological with 0 halo in a periodic / flat direction, but still good to explicitly check I think...). When comparing numeric equality for nodes, we should add `@allowscalar` as needed there. I think we should add a test that equality works as expected, as well. We should also add a test for checkpointing on stretched grids. I think its ok if we don't support a numeric equality for other grids --- we can build them up one at a time. They are specific to each grid. The main downside here is that we need to refactor our grid implementation to have a single `RectilinearGrid` (there's no reason to have different rectilinear grid types, since we can dispatch on the case that certain directions have constant spacing easily). So this code will go away when we make that change. But I think it's a useful incremental improvement for now while we still have two rectilinear grids, so I'm fine to have it go in once it's cleaned up. Because of this:. ```julia; julia> using CUDA. julia> a = rand(2); 2-element Vector{Float64}:; 0.8207604162394306; 0.3815099688071648. julia> b = CuArray(a); 2-element CuArray{Float64, 1}:; 0.8207604162394306; 0.3815099688071648. julia> CUDA.@allowscalar a == b; true; ```.

Testability,"Couple thoughts from a discussion with @ali-ramadhan today:. To get `DiskTimeSeries` working with `JLD2OutputWriter`, we'll need to 1) serialize the grid (mostly for convenience...) and 2) serialize ""meta"" for fields by adding lines like. ```julia; file[""serialized/grid""] = model.grid. for (i, out) in enumerate(outputs); field_name = keys(outputs)[i]; out isa AbstractField && (file[""timeseries/$field_name/meta/location""] = location(out)); end; ```. to the `JLD2OutputWriter` constructor. We need a bit of extra work for `ReducedField`... though on second though it might be easier to build this logic into `DiskTimeSeries`. Some logic for serializing boundary conditions might be nice too (sometimes, but not always possible). This, plus changing the default `FieldSlicer` to `nothing`, are the primary changes that's needed for `JLD2OutputWriter`, I think. For `NetCDFOutputWriter`, the field location needs to be saved as a string in the field's attributes. I think we have what we need to reconstruct the grid otherwise. @ali-ramadhan can comment.

Testability,"EDIT: This has nothing to do with Oceananigans.jl per se. Better pursued on LambertW.jl. I agree with https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3438#issuecomment-1904990127 . This part of the stack trace suggests that it is the `@warn` that is causing the problem. It should be possible to remove that somehow. Better would be to remove the `@warn` entirely and instead return the result along with info on the convergence. And maybe convenience interface for people who want to ignore it. That's a more robust interface for other reasons as well. I don't know anything about running on GPUs. Does `@warn` cause failure if it is anywhere in the package being compiled? or anywhere in the function being called? Or does execution have to hit the `@warn` so that io is attempted at run time?. EDIT: I missed this above:; >> Do you get a warning during CPU execution ?. > Nope. Everything seems to run pretty smoothly:. So it seems that execution does not have to hit the `@warn` for the reported failure. Also the stack trace indicates that the error happens when the macro is expanded. EDIT: so the following comment may be relevant, but perhaps not. It would be nice if there were a way to redirect io or send it to dev null or otherwise disable everywhere when running on a GPU. ```; Reason: unsupported call to an unknown function (call to jl_f__call_latest); Stacktrace:; [1] #invokelatest#2; @ ./essentials.jl:816; [2] invokelatest; @ ./essentials.jl:813; [3] macro expansion; @ ./logging.jl:381; [4] lambertw_root_finding; @ /glade/work/tomasc/.julia/packages/LambertW/tom9a/src/LambertW.jl:188; [5] lambertw_branch_zero; @ /glade/work/tomasc/.julia/packages/LambertW/tom9a/src/LambertW.jl:117; [6] _lambertw; @ /glade/work/tomasc/.julia/packages/LambertW/tom9a/src/LambertW.jl:93; [7] lambertw (repeats 2 times); @ /glade/work/tomasc/.julia/packages/LambertW/tom9a/src/LambertW.jl:73; [8] W; @ /glade/derecho/scratch/tomasc/twake4/headland_simulations/mwe.jl:9; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3438#issuecomment-1910836945:1491,log,logging,1491,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3438#issuecomment-1910836945,1,['log'],['logging']

Second, you can see an older version of the plot [here](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1648). Since then we've added first order upwinding. I haven't tried running this for a while and hope it works but I guess I should try it and find out. I should point out that this script uses `ShallowWaterModel`. It is easy enough to change it for another of the two models, but I did see some odd behaviour. For `ShallowWaterModel` we have that the error goes down to 1e-14, basically machine precision and the slopes are what we should expect. When I tried this for `NonhydrostaticModel`, I found that the error didn't get any better than 1e-11 or so. I looked into this but never figured out why. The major difference between the two models is that `ShallowWater` does no thave a pressure solve, so I suspect that might be part of the problem. In the end I decided that the latter was probably the best way to test pure advection. But in retrospect, if we used `PrescribedVelocity`, then the pressure solve would not be a factor, and things should work out nicely.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2060#issuecomment-969007656:1016,test,test,1016,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2060#issuecomment-969007656,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Great job! Though I have not looked at the code, I have two comments:. 1. I am surprised that the choice of `regularization` affects the convergence rate. I will think about it more.; 2. The rate of convergence depends on the distribution of eigenvalues of the preconditioned linear operator. I have a piece code of that outputs the preconditioned linear operator as a dense `Matrix`, which can be useful for testing the convergence rate and new algorithms without invoking `Oceananigans`. It can be helpful for testing why `FlatExtrapolationOpenBoundaryCondition` results in a much slower convergence. Besides, I have found that grids with better symmetry have faster convergence because the resulting Laplacian operators have more repeated eigenvalues. In theory, the number of iterations required for the CG method to get the exact solution is the number of unique eigenvalues. ```Julia; using LinearAlgebra; using Oceananigans; using Oceananigans.Models.NonhydrostaticModels: ImmersedPoissonSolver; using Oceananigans.ImmersedBoundaries: active_cells_map, immersed_cell, mask_immersed_field!; using Oceananigans.Solvers: solve!; using Statistics: norm, mean. using Oceananigans.Solvers: precondition!.

I am skeptical about the value of this test. In general, discretizations _do not necessarily_ represent the balance states of the continuous systems they approximate. Thus in general this test should fail! It will succeed of course in the case that the discrete system shares a balanced state with the continuous state. I think this is flawed as a _test_ because, while certainly formulating discrete systems that share balanced states with their continuous systems is _desirable_, I'm not sure it's something we want to guarantee via CI. We should be allowed to violate this prescription if the discrete system has other _more important_ desirable properties. It could be a nice validation test though. In this particular case, the nonhydrostatic useful is most often used for simulations of _vigorous_ turbulence in which weak flows induced by a violation of hydrostatic balance are likely irrelevant.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1910#issuecomment-890017453:88,test,test,88,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1910#issuecomment-890017453,8,"['Test', 'log', 'test']","['Test', 'log', 'test']"

Testability,"Hello, ; Do you want to simulate a channel flow or a turbulent boundary layer? Because at the moment, you are just specifying the drag at the bottom (which I guess is a model for the no-slip boundary condition), while a channel requires no-slip at both the top and the bottom. Also, in case you want to simulate a turbulent boundary layer, take care that it is not a periodic case but spatially developing in the streamwise direction, so if you are looking for the self-similar solution (the log-law), you need to rescale somewhere at the beginning or the end of the domain. ; This is not a problem with a fully developed channel flow that is statistically homogeneous in the streamwise direction. Given that you probably need to specify the drag at the top and bottom (unless drag is only for roughness), also `cᴰᵇ` is wrong.

Energy always decreases (rapidly). Momentum is more squirrely, but fortunately we do find that specifying drag / no-slip seems to extract more momentum than otherwise (eg than with free slip boundary conditions). The amount of momentum lost with a free-slip boundary condition and hills of size `h=0.2` is roughly equivalent to the flat bottom case with no-slip. There's also transient periods with `h=0.2` where the case with no-slip boundary conditions has more momentum than free-slip. I'm going to run a few more cases at higher resolution.

Maybe two tests: one for `ComputedField` with interpolation or derivatives, and another with `KernelComputedField` (that's maybe a bit simpler)?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1517#issuecomment-817992499:430,test,test,430,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1517#issuecomment-817992499,4,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"Hey thanks for doing all this! Things look a lot neater. Just have a few comments/thoughts that I'll pepper throughout but should be good to merge!. > A `Model` constructor is now provided in which all important information can be input via keyword arguments. This is great for understanding what the model does, I agree. Would still be nice to keep the ""legacy constructor"" around for when you just want to create a simple `Model` for playing around with or for testing. And it makes for very nice and simple example code. > I also reduced the computational burden of a few of the tests, and changed to factor of 2 resolutions since this makes sense for FFTs (though relatively unimportant for testing, I think should encourage users to use powers of 2 and make a habit of using them ourselves). I would argue against this. While we should try to use powers of 2 for performance, I think that overly restricts the model resolutions we can be running at. There are a LOT of choices between e.g. `512x512x128` and `1024x1024x128`. It might be that the largest model that fits in memory isn't nice powers of 2. Users may have various reasons for running resolutions that aren't powers of 2. Either way, we should always be testing a wide range of grid sizes (and weird grid sizes like `109x77x13`) because the code should work for all of them. If computational cost becomes an issue we should look into paying for extra CI resources rather than reduce testing. > A few more notes:. Might be good to create some new issues based on those just to keep track of what needs to be done. > The examples are outdated. We should probably reduce the number of examples until the code becomes more stable, and commit to maintaining the few that remain. This is something I'm actively working on in a different branch.

Testability,"Hi @c42f thank you for chiming in! Will definitely ping you as we work on logging. I think we probably should have tackled logging much earlier. We still use `@printf` and vanilla `@info` for logging, which has been quite counter-productive haha. Definitely hoping we can reach a useful logger that can; * help developers by providing info and debug messages. Also nice in test logs.; * help users understand what the model is doing and provide a better and more responsive user experience by logging what the model is doing. This is where `@setup` and `@diagnostic` logging messages might be really nice. Although `@setup` and `@diagnostic` might be bad names as they don't imply logging? Not sure of the best solution but maybe your kwarg suggestion would help here, e.g. `@info source=""diagnostic"" msg`?. @arcavaliere seems to be developing a pretty general-purpose `ModelLogger` which hopefully we can adapt for all these uses! @arcavaliere I'm more than happy to help if you need anything. MicroLogging.jl looks pretty neat! I like that it puts the log level, file name, and line number on the right as putting them on the left causes messages not to align and makes logs harder to read.

Furthermore, I don't think removing `@disallowscalar` would cause tests to fail; rather, it means that those tests _will_ pass even if they have scalar operations (where previously they would not have passed or would have thrown an error).

Testability,"Hmmm, I don't know if many log levels will be that helpful. I guess for debug messages we'll want to have the file name and line number, but for user-facing info messages maybe we should remove the file name and line number and instead a custom log level like `DIAGNOSTIC` or `MODEL_SETUP` will be useful. I think one place that logging can hugely improve user experience is in setting up large models, especially on the GPU, where you could be waiting for several minutes while all of Julia, CUDA, and Oceananigans compiles, model is being set up, memory is allocated, etc. We know it takes time but most users will think that something is wrong if Julia is silent for 5 minutes. In this context info messages can be useful and reassure the user that Oceananigans is working properly.

Our initial guess is that it might be related to #3056.

Testability,"I did a few tests with some criteria for timestep-skipping with a couple of my own simulations in addition to the MWE included here. In summary:. 1. Criterion `sim.Δt / 1e10`: successfully gets rids of the problem in both the MWE and in my simulations; 2. Criterion `10 * eps(sim.Δt) * sim.Δt`: doesn't get rid of the problem in any simulation; 3. `100 * eps(sim.Δt) * sim.Δt`: fixes the problem in the MWE but not in my simulations, although it does decrease its frequency of occurrence a good amount.; 4. `1000 * eps(sim.Δt) * sim.Δt`: fixes everything in all simulations I've tried. So only options 1 and 4 fully fix the problem (at least in the simulations I've tried so far). For me both those options rely on pretty arbitrary numbers though, so I'm not very happy with neither. From the point of view seeing the timestep-skipping as an approximation ($u^{n+1} \approx u^n$), then maybe criterion 1 makes more sense, although I'm not sure how it'd behave for Float32 simulations. I see three possible ways to go about it right now:. 1. Do what this PR is doing, and manually set the criterion to either option 1 or 4 above. If it turns out that some simulations still have issues, we revisit.; 2. We add `min_Δt` as a property of `NonhydrostaticModel` (or maybe `Simulation`?). I think the minimum `Δt` for which time skipping will be necessary will vary significantly between simulations, so this solution deals with that by leaving the decision up to the user if they are interested in the pressure output.; 3.

Testability,"I don't think there's a chicken and egg problem. Testing new features requires some initiative and also experience with / understanding of the relevant science applications. I think the ""egg"" is the validation test itself. A groomed, pedagogical docs example is the ""chicken"" that emerges from that egg. I also think that validation is not just about ensuring quantative accuracy, but about working out the user interface. We want the docs implementations to reflect relatively mature user interfaces, since the docs examples are relatively influential pieces of code. I believe immersed boundaries are still experimental, not least in light of #3142. What are the quantitative validation tests that use immersed boundaries? The only one that I know if is the one I worked on, which shows that a stratified ocean remains at rest:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/main/validation/immersed_boundaries/resting_stratified_bumpy_ocean.jl. We haven't documented those results well, though. The internal tide case could be adapted to validate immersed boundaries with the hydrostatic model, leveraging the vast literature on that subject. I don't think the example involves a comparison with theory or other published numerical results though. It wouldn't be that much work to turn that case into a validation test. As for `NonhydrostaticModel`, by all accounts it seems that it should be experimental until we have a validated pressure solver. It could be interesting to see if we can validate the nonhydrostatic model for certain LES cases, somehow. Otherwise, we do know that pressure solver is in general incorrect (either impenetrability across immersed boundaries is not satisfied, or the velocity field is divergent close to the immersed boundary).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3148#issuecomment-1601130874:49,Test,Testing,49,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3148#issuecomment-1601130874,4,"['Test', 'test']","['Testing', 'test', 'tests']"

Testability,I find that the code for boundary conditions for particles cannot deal with unusually large velocity \(when $u\Delta t$ has the order of the domain size\). Fixing the related code \(Yixiao-Zhang/Oceananigans.jl@95f68a1\) enables running the script that I posted previously in this page. Do we need an additional test for such cases?. One remaining question is why the log shows that the error occurs from the pressure solver. Can we do anything to improve the accuracy of error messages?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3320#issuecomment-1753799918:312,test,test,312,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3320#issuecomment-1753799918,2,"['log', 'test']","['log', 'test']"

Testability,"I guess both would be good. But specifically I meant that it'd be good for someone to run the same scripts I ran and see if they can reproduce the behavior. Who knows, maybe it's something wrong in my setup. (Although I have tried in both my laptop and on the Casper cluster.). I do think it's weird that an error (apparently) this serious isn't being caught by the tests, so it's very possible that I'm making a silly mistake somewhere... having someone investigate this as well would alleviate this concern a bit.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1517#issuecomment-814125461:366,test,tests,366,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1517#issuecomment-814125461,1,['test'],['tests']
