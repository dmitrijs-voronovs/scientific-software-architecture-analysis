See [our blog post on DRAGEN-GATK](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360039984151-DRAGEN-GATK-Update-Let-s-get-more-specific) for more details on these improvements. A full `DRAGEN-GATK` pipeline that leverages these new features will be released in the near future as a WDL workflow script in the [WARP](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp) repo on GitHub as well as a featured workspace in [Terra](https://terra.bio/). ; * Below is a summary of the improvements we've ported from DRAGEN in this release.

The python code for this tool was written by members of NVIDIA Genomics Research. ; * Thank you Babak Zamirai, Ankit Sethia, Mehrzad Samadi, George Vacek and the whole NVIDIA genomics team!; * This [ GATK blog post ](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/10064202674971-Introducing-NVIDIA-s-NVScoreVariants-a-new-deep-learning-tool-for-filtering-variants) has more of the story from when we first made the tool available for testing.; * New `Funcotator` argument `--prefer-mane-transcripts` which improves transcript selection and lays groundwork for upcoming improvements.; * New argument `--variant-output-filtering` which lets you restrict output variants based on the input intervals. This replaces and imrpoves on `--only-output-calls-starting-in-interval` and works with `SelectVariants` and other VariantWalkers. This is useful to prevent duplicating variants when splitting an input VCF into multiple shards. **Full list of changes:**; -------------------------; * **CNNScoreVariants -> NVScoreVariants** (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8004, https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/9010, https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/9009); * CNNScore variants has been replaced by NVScoreVariants, scripts that use it should be updated to use NVScoreVariants instead.; * The training tools (CNNVariantTrain, ",MatchSource.RELEASES,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases/tag/4.6.1.0:1153,avail,available,1153,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases/tag/4.6.1.0,1,['avail'],['available']

Previously we required Java 8, which is now end-of-life. ; * Newer non-LTS Java releases such as Java 18 or Java 19 may work as well, but since they are untested by us we only officially support running with Java 17. * Significant enhancements to `SelectVariants`, including arguments to enable `GVCF` filtering support and to work with genotype fields more easily. * A new tool `SVConcordance`, that calculates SV genotype concordance between an ""evaluation"" VCF and a ""truth"" VCF. * Bug fixes and enhancements to the support for the Ultima Genomics flow-based sequencing platform introduced in GATK 4.3.0.0. **Full list of changes:**; -------------------------. * **Flow-based Variant Calling**; * `FlowFeatureMapper`: added surrounding-median-quality-size feature (#8222); * Removed hardcoded limit on max homopolymer call (#8088); * Fixed bug in dynamic read disqualification (#8171); * Fixed a bug in the parsing of the T0 tag (#8185); * Updated flow-based calling `Mutect2` parameters to make them consistent with the `HaplotypeCaller` parameters (#8186); ; * **SelectVariants**; * Enabled GVCF type filtering support in `SelectVariants` (#7193); * Added an optional argument `--ignore-non-ref-in-types` to support correct handling of VariantContexts that contain a NON_REF allele. This is necessary because every variant in a GVCF file would otherwise be assigned the type MIXED, which makes it impossible to filter for e.g. SNPs.; * Note that this only enables correct handling of GVCF input.

This is necessary because every variant in a GVCF file would otherwise be assigned the type MIXED, which makes it impossible to filter for e.g. SNPs.; * Note that this only enables correct handling of GVCF input. The filtered output files are VCF (not GVCF) files, since reference blocks are not extended when a variant is filtered out.; * `SelectVariants`: added new arguments for controlling genotype JEXL filtering (#8092); * `-select-genotype`: with this new genotype-specific JEXL argument, we support easily filtering by genotype fields with expressions like 'GQ > 0', where the behavior in the multi-sample case is 'GQ > 0' in at least one sample. It's still possible to manually access genotype fields using the old `-select` argument and expressions such as `vc.getGenotype('NA12878').getGQ() > 0`.; * `--apply-jexl-filters-first`: This flag is provided to allow the user to do JEXL filtering before subsetting the format fields, in particular the case where the filtering is done on INFO fields only, which may improve speed when working with a large cohort VCF that contains genotypes for thousands of samples. * **SV Calling**; * Added a new tool `SVConcordance`, that calculates SV genotype concordance between an ""evaluation"" VCF and a ""truth"" VCF (#7977); * R",MatchSource.RELEASES,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases/tag/4.4.0.0:2009,extend,extended,2009,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases/tag/4.4.0.0,1,['extend'],['extended']

All the python tools have been updated appropriately. This will enable easier integration of new machine learning tools. ; * ***If you use python tools outside of the docker, you must rebuild your conda environment for this release***; * `CNNScoreVariants` has been replaced by `NVScoreVariants`, a rewritten and modernized version. The python code for this tool was written by members of NVIDIA Genomics Research. ; * Thank you Babak Zamirai, Ankit Sethia, Mehrzad Samadi, George Vacek and the whole NVIDIA genomics team!; * This [ GATK blog post ](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/10064202674971-Introducing-NVIDIA-s-NVScoreVariants-a-new-deep-learning-tool-for-filtering-variants) has more of the story from when we first made the tool available for testing.; * New `Funcotator` argument `--prefer-mane-transcripts` which improves transcript selection and lays groundwork for upcoming improvements.; * New argument `--variant-output-filtering` which lets you restrict output variants based on the input intervals. This replaces and imrpoves on `--only-output-calls-starting-in-interval` and works with `SelectVariants` and other VariantWalkers. This is useful to prevent duplicating variants when splitting an input VCF into multiple shards. **Full list of changes:**; -------------------------; * **CNNScoreVariants -> NVScoreVariants** (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8004, https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/9010, https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/9009); * CNNScore variants has been replaced by NVScoreVariants, scripts that use it should be updated to use NVScoreVariants instead.; * The training tools (CNNVariantTrain, ",MatchSource.RELEASES,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases/tag/4.6.1.0:1167,test,testing,1167,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases/tag/4.6.1.0,1,['test'],['testing']
