Availability,"We've discussed moving `validation` to another repo in the past. Certainly that would decrease our maintenance burden during development, while tracking the Oceananigans version that the validation scripts are ""guaranteed"" to work with. The main downside I think is that the validation repo goes stale by design. By putting `validation` in `Oceananigans` and requiring the scripts to run during CI we ""enforce"" that the scripts are up to date with the API implemented in `master`. This helps the validation scripts better serve their purpose... One solution might be to split up the scripts in `validation/`. A growing number of the `validation` cases really just use an ""eyeball"" norm and more serve to demonstrate functionality than to ""validate"" it in a scientific sense. (This includes the immersed boundary case.) Perhaps we can create a new repo for these cases which achieve most of their value as ""advanced examples"", while keeping quantitatively valuable validation cases in the main repo.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1634#issuecomment-832055527:99,mainten,maintenance,99,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1634#issuecomment-832055527,2,"['down', 'mainten']","['downside', 'maintenance']"

Availability,"Well, it looks like this PR does not completely solve the problem, and the jury is out perhaps on whether it helps or not. I did learn a few things. It seems the race condition originates from an attempt to ""re-resolve"" the manifest during the test:. https://buildkite.com/clima/oceananigans/builds/17516#01920c32-4e89-4654-a4a8-9b077e51e87c/39-221. The puzzling part is how to solve the problem. I thought at first we could solve it by preventing the Manifest from being ""re-resolved"" --- perhaps by resolving it correctly during initialization? But actually, this isn't possible, since the problematic manifest in question is a temporary run that is created only for the tests (and its different from the project's manifest, because it also includes the test dependencies). This temporary test manifest can't be initialized as far as I can tell and is created independently for each test. Finally, it seems that some race conditions happen in a print statement (this is just from reading the error message). It all boils down eventually to these two lines:. https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl/blob/5fbfa125045ce3e68ce10bf9fc1727bb3232c123/src/Operations.jl#L799-L800.

Availability,"Well, the usage is limited here because we always ""count from 1"". For an atmospheric simulation with a sponge layer on top, you might have a stretched coordinate as the domain gets higher and higher. Then you could keep your levels fixed and reduce the height of the domain by changing Nz. This might be convenient if you've carefully designed your vertical coordinate to get the spacings ""right"" at the bottom of the domain, but care a lot less about what happens higher up. Then if you get more computational power, you can increase Nz (decreasing the dependence of the stuff lower down on your ""sponge region""). We actually have a similar situation in the ocean where the vertical coordinate is carefully designed in the upper ocean; we could in principle ask for fewer ""lower"" levels --- now that would be a feature we might want to add too!. I think that's why it's good to have a guideline like ""throw an error when we _know_ things are incorrect"". Because if we get into the business of trying to ""predict what users want to do"", we'll quickly find our imaginations are limited! Personally my philosophy is to allow as much as possible because it lets people exercise creativity as freely as possible (not limited by what I personally think people should do).

Then we can implement. ```julia; function set_dt!(simulation, new_dt); validate_time_step_size(simulation.model, dt); simulation.dt = dt; return nothing; end; ```. Now, model developers have the option to implement this function (and the fallback would be `nothing`).

What if we consdier the rotation of a Gaussian bump? That is a classic problem and we could text the order of accuracy after one time step, or after a full rotation. That way we can determine empirically what the orders of accuracy are for the different schemes.; 3.

However, where we write `collect`, its probably better to rewrite this in a different way. But note that `collect` is only used for plotting. So what we do here depends on the application. @sangeethasankar01 are you trying to get this to run on the GPU for some specific purpose? Or is this merely an educational exercise?.

Maybe it makes sense to try and condense some abstract operations into an isolated minimal working example which we can use to open an issue on CUDA.jl if that turns out to be the problem? Might help isolate the problem, and would certainly be much easier to debug. I recall we encounter a limitation of the GPU compiler when trying to construct a GPU model with too many arbitrary tracers.

Availability,"Yeah I think this change would help! It would definitely make things; clearer. Here's a couple alternative thoughts though:.

Availability,"Yep, they are, although extension to 3D non-hydrostatic is possible and easy to implement. `multi_dimensional` is opposed to a direction-by-direction reconstruction. It means that we reconstruct not only in the ""derivative"" direction but also in the ""tangential"" direction, i.e. we use a multi-dimensional stencil as opposed to a one-dimensional stencil. For the moment, it is only implemented for the vector invariant advection since it is quite expensive to implement it in a full 3d reconstruction (it would require a 3D stencil, while vector_invariant only requires a 2D stencil). It improves a bit the solution for what I have tested but more tests are needed, I think to make sure it de facto increases the order of reconstruction (for non-linear problems, it should allow a high-order reconstruction, on the contrary, our advection schemes only allow us second order spatial scaling of the truncation error.).

Availability,"Yes we definitely need to speed up the tests. I think 95% of the time it takes to run tests is spent in compilation, however, so creating fewer models may not help much. Instead we may need to be more strategic with how we run tests, and perhaps also work on speeding up compilation time using something like [SnoopCompile.jl](https://github.com/timholy/SnoopCompile.jl). On #1962 we add bars capability, which will allow us to separate the tests into a few categories: fast-running, crucial tests will run on every commit to a PR, and slower, more comprehensive integration tests will run only when `bors try` or `bors r+` is invoked. This might help streamline the development workflow. Also if we are using Caltech's central cluster for CI we can potentially split the jobs amongst more workers, which might help speed up tests overall. Even more important is simplifying the test implementation. Right now updating tests and validation experiments is a time sink for developers that change the API and has really slowed development down lately. So we shouldn't rewrite tests in a way that makes development more difficult (eg keeping the maintenance burden of the test infrastructure small is more important than decreasing the computational cost of tests).

Availability,"Yes! Make sure to work from `main` because remember we changed how `TimeInterval` works recently. `TimeInterval` actuates on this criteria:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/dc5dc28c6cf433dcb8a6668cef99e98309e6ead9/src/Utils/schedules.jl#L65-L79. when `t` exceeds or is equal to `next_actuation_time`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/dc5dc28c6cf433dcb8a6668cef99e98309e6ead9/src/Utils/schedules.jl#L58-L63.

I think `WindowedTimeAverage` works differently and looks at `previous_stop_time`, plus the `interval` of the time-averaging. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/dc5dc28c6cf433dcb8a6668cef99e98309e6ead9/src/OutputWriters/windowed_time_average.jl#L90. and `previous_stop_time` is recorded here:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/dc5dc28c6cf433dcb8a6668cef99e98309e6ead9/src/OutputWriters/windowed_time_average.jl#L91. which in turn is called here:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/dc5dc28c6cf433dcb8a6668cef99e98309e6ead9/src/OutputWriters/windowed_time_average.jl#L280. So there's something about using the previous stop time, rather than the _number_ of actuations, which incurs a floating point error issue. I think `AveragedTimeInterval` should somehow use a _number_ of actuations as a criteria. Not sure actually how that would work, need to study the flow of information in detail.

Availability,"Yes, that is pretty much what I had in mind but for a different physical problem. . There are a variety of ways one can do this. Below are a few that come to mind. 1. Power method: worked well for Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and should work well for other problems. Two nice features are that it's pretty simple, and it's already coded up for one example so should be easy to adapt. One not so nice feature is that it only tells us the most unstable mode (spatial structure, growth rates and phase speed) but it doesn't tell us about any other unstable modes. 2. Arnoldi Method: A quick google search came across this [library](https://haampie.github.io/ArnoldiMethod.jl/stable/). I have not tried it but could try adapting it to the above mentioned KH problem. . 3. Standard eigenvals: If we assume periodicity in two directions it boils down to a 1D eigenvalue problem that should be easy to solve using eigenvals. There should be a direct solver that forms a full matrix and gives you all the eigenfunctions but the indirect uses Arnoldi and gives you some. .

Then `f_op` gives the correct answer, but `f_perturbation_op` does not. And yes, I agree the core of the issue is that `u_avg` isn't computed before. If I first compute `u_avg`, then `f_perturbation_op` also produces the correct result. But is that the expected behavior?

Availability,"You should be able to impose `NormalFlow` (we've done this for flow past a cylinder, I think). The outflow condition is tricky. In reality we want a condition like an Orlanski / radiation boundary condition, but we don't have those implemented. In lieu of that you'll have to use a sponge layer to relax the velocity / transport to what's specified at the outflow. But in that case a periodic domain + downstream sponge layer could work just as well.

Availability,"You should write. ```julia; import Oceananigans.Utils: cell_advection_timescale; ```. at the top of the file `shallow_water_cell_advection_timescale.jl`. This ""imports"" the name `cell_advection_timescale` into your present scope such that the function can be extended with new methods. Next, you want to define a new method for `cell_advection_timescale` with the signature. ```julia; cell_advection_timescale(model::ShallowWaterModel) = # definition here; ```. Note that the function signature. ```julia; cell_advection_timescale(uh, vh, h, grid); ```. is already taken by one of the existing methods for `cell_advection_timescale`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/2016e730350e0b6b625a5cf85a68269a370686fd/src/Utils/cell_advection_timescale.jl#L2-L12. This means that you need to either use type annotations to distinguish the version that takes arguments `uh, vh, h, grid` from the method that takes `u, v, w, grid`, or (probably better) use a unique name. A good name for the method that takes the arguments `uh, vh, h, grid` could be. ```julia; shallow_water_cell_advection_timescale(uh, vh, h, grid) = # definition here; ```. Remember that with this new name, the function `cell_advection_timescale(model::ShallowWaterModel)` must call `shallow_water_cell_advection_timescale`; eg. ```; cell_advection_timescale(model::ShallowWaterModel) =; shallow_water_cell_advection_timescale(model.solution.uh.data.parent,; model.solution.vh.data.parent,; model.solution.h.data.parent,; model.grid); ```. when this file is put together, you should include it in `ShallowWaterModels.jl`. This should allow you to `run!` a `Simulation` with `TimeStepWizard`. Perhaps it makes sense to add a test for this in this PR?.

Also, we've provided a parameterized convenience type for a Gaussian `mask`. So, sponge layers are simply one application of `Relaxation`. @tomchor, perhaps what you're saying is that a Gaussian is not appropriate for a sponge layer `mask`, since one might want a function with a sharper cutoff (subject to @navidcy's caveats). I think this is a valid criticism --- it might make sense to add more appropriate parameterized types (using tanh's, etc?)

Availability,"`CUDA.CuArray`](https://juliagpu.gitlab.io/CUDA.jl/usage/array/https://juliagpu.gitlab.io/CUDA.jl/usage/array/). It looks like you are using an object called `df.taux` that comes out of the `CSV` package:. ```julia; spl_taux = Spline1D(secs, df.taux / ρₒ, k=1); ```. Provided that whatever `Spline1D` does is GPU-friendly (and it may not be), then you may only need to convert `df.taux / ρₒ` to a `CuArray` prior to passing it to `Spline1D`. I don't know if this code would work, but as an example of something you _might_ do:. ```julia; using CUDA. kinematic_x_momentum_flux = Array(df.taux / ρₒ); kinematic_x_momentum_flux = CuArray(kinematic_x_momentum_flux). spl_taux = Spline1D(secs, kinematic_x_momentum_flux, k=1); ```. The array `secs` may also need to be converted:. ```julia; secs = CuArray(secs); ```. `Spline1D` may not work on the GPU, but there seem to be other options. A google search for ""interpolation GPU julia"" turned up this page:. https://juliagpu.org/2020-10-30-cuda_2.1/. which has instructions for using some CUDA built-in interpolation functionality. In summary, if you're working with arrays on the GPU, you'll need to. * convert arrays to `CuArray` when using the GPU; * use interpolation / other functionality that's GPU-friendly. As a side note, a convenient way to program a script to be switchable from CPU to GPU easily is to include a line at the top like. ```julia; DeviceArrayType = arch isa GPU ? CuArray : Array; ```. and then use patterns like. ```julia; data = Array(df.data); data = convert(DeviceArrayType, data); ```. This allows you to switch between `arch = GPU()` and `arch = CPU()` with a single line at the top of your script. As a side, side note, julia does not require you to put semi-colons to end lines!. Please don't be afraid to simply try running your script and reporting the error you get (if any!)

Availability,"`const` matters when a variable is referenced as a global variable in a function; something like. ```julia; const a = 2; f(x) = a * x; ```. `a` is not an argument to `f(x)`; it's value is taken from the global scope. In that case it needs to be `const`, or `f(x)` cannot be compiled on the GPU. When numbers are added to explicit data structures --- which is what happens when they are inserted into the `parameters` kwarg in the constructor for `BoundaryCondition` or `Forcing` --- then it's irrelevant whether a variable is declared `const`. This is because in that case the variable is explicitly an argument to the function (eg via the argument `p` in `boundary_condition(x, y, t, p)`). In fact, this is the purpose of the `parameters` kwarg --- to avoid having to use `const` (which is annoying or inconvenient, and has compilation / performance pitfalls). However the API has not developed enough to completely avoid `const` in all cases (eg for `BackgroundFields`, or for masking / target functions in things like `Relaxation`).

Availability,"`no method matching south_ib_flux`. Could this be specific to immersed boundary or has the turbulence closure definition of the molecular values of kinematic viscosity and diffusivity changed since #1277?. Here's a question. Doing wall-resolved LES is a bit tricky here. In the way the code is written, the diffusivity for wall fluxes with value or gradient boundary condition is derived from the model closure. For closure tuples, the logical thing to do is to add all the diffusivities together to come up with the immersed flux. However, this means that to do wall resolved LES we have to solve a tricky problem which is how to specify that the LES diffusivity has a value of 0 on the boundary. The interface implemented here doesn't support that; when we write `ValueBoundaryCondition(0)` what that means is that we add fluxes to a tendency consistent with `ValueBoundaryCondition(0)`. (The alternative, which would essentially mean ""return `0` when the field is reconstructed on boundary faces"" requires feeding boundary conditions into the reconstruction operator used by the closure. Doing that would substantially complicate the code.) This means effectively that there's no way to set the LES diffusivity to 0 on an immersed boundary. Even if there were a way to ensure this, it's also inconvenient to have to specify boundary conditions on the LES diffusivities... An alternative approach might attach a diffusivity / viscosity to the immersed boundary condition. Then the closure is ignored when calculating the immersed flux and the ""boundary diffusivity"" is used instead. This has some convenience downsides (ie diffusivity values have to be passed both to the closure _and_ the boundary condition), but would at least produce correct results in a straightforward way. I won't be able to spend too much time on working out the kinks for wall-resolved LES since the priority of the Climate Modeling Alliance is flux boundary conditions for wall-modeled LES and large-scale GCM problems...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2437#issuecomment-1107321166:1888,down,downsides,1888,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2437#issuecomment-1107321166,1,['down'],['downsides']

Availability,"able to start running distributed simulations immediately with minimal start up time). Here are a few things I learned:. * Remember to load a system MPI on your HPC, eg `module load openmpi`; * MPI may have to be installed / configured carefully --- after loading a system MPI. `MPIPreferences` can help:. ```julia; using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(); ```. https://juliaparallel.org/MPI.jl/stable/configuration/. * Configuring SLURM correctly may also require some trial and error, because the documentation is unclear and there are a huge number of options. I can't figure out if the documentation is wrong, in fact, or if instead the engaging cluster does not support some options. Either way, a small test script like. ```julia; using MPI. MPI.Init(); @show MPI.Comm_rank(MPI.COMM_WORLD); @show MPI.Comm_size(MPI.COMM_WORLD); ```. Is helpful for debugging. Also, I recommend first trying to start jobs interactively before using `sbatch`. Interactive jobs launch faster, so we get a faster trial-error iteration. I'm still working on things, but it seems like another point may be salient:. * Initialize / precompile outside of a parallel job before trying to launch a parallel job via `mpiexec`. Here are some notes that may be specific to engaging:. I'm using `srun` to get a 4-GPU node to use interactively:. ```; srun -p my_partition --tasks-per-node=4 --cpus-per-task=32 --gres=gpu:4 --gpus-per-node=4 --mem=0 -t 01:00:00 -N 1; ```. it seems we have to use the option `gpus-per-node`, rather than setting the total number of GPUs. Also we redundantly also have to specify `gres=gpu:4` (`gres` stands for ""generalized resource""). Why `gres` can't tell what `gpus-per-node` is, I don't know. `-N 1` means 1 node. Finally we also have to specify ``--tasks-per-node=4` (matching `gres` _and_ the number of GPUs per node), otherwise we cannot launch `mpiexec` with 4 tasks (1 for each GPU). It's helpful to have the maximum number of CPUs for precompilation. Otherwise precom",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3698#issuecomment-2389107436:1165,error,error,1165,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3698#issuecomment-2389107436,2,['error'],['error']

I've plotted both the IBM and non-IBM (lighter colors) results to see the differences. This one is on a log plot. You can see that leakage is happening in the IBM versions. It's hard to say how bad the leakage is here, and it'll probably be better to consider an initial constant concentration rather than sinusoidal to see how much leakage is occurring due to the immersed solid. ![volint_Concentration_log](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67593861/122986580-a058c400-d36d-11eb-9a7c-e3e8d2a7367e.png).

The error between the nonIBM and IBM versions at these same grid sizes are below. Unfortunately this is not getting better with increased resolution. This could be due to base state changes causing the stress to change and not necessarily something wrong with the method. It might take better refinement than 256 x 256 to really see a trend here. ![Bickley_dudy_diff](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67593861/122987679-dc405900-d36e-11eb-895a-0f66daf9a473.png). Any thought on these results would be greatly appreciated, or if there is something else that might be good to look at with this particular test case. Further refinements to the grid are taking quite a long time to run on my PC, but they can be done. These were run with a viscosity of 0 for the isotropic closure. I want to look at the viscous cases of these to see if the results change at all with added viscosity.

Would also be interested to learn about your project which seems to be very cool. Thanks so much for working on NetCDF.jl! I didn't mean to sound ungrateful about NetCDF.jl's performance. We were just debating which package to use. With https://github.com/JuliaGeo/NetCDF.jl/issues/87 fixed, I think we'll be happy for a long time. The `compress=9` bug explains why the IO was slow. @glwagner has suggested that for a project of our scale we'd want to help and contribute to the packages we use. We definitely want to stick with NetCDF as it's the _de facto_ standard in the climate, atmospheric, and ocean sciences. A discussion might be helpful down the line. With faster IO I think we're happy now and we're still figuring how to do IO long-term. > My feeling is that if you want to write NetCDF files through the HDF API that it will be more work, though I never tried.; > ; > Regarding NetCDF.jl & NCDatasets.jl, I feel that the statements in the OP that NetCDF.jl is not being maintained and that NCDatasets.jl grew out of bugs not being fixed is are a bit of a misrepresentation.; > ; > For installations and dependency reduction, hopefully the new HDF5 release, which will for the first time support cross compilation, will lead to HDF5.jl switching to BinaryBuilder, which will allow NetCDF.jl to do the same.

The latter approach is probably preferable since it may be more broadly useful. > Doing 4th order Center Differencing in either model would be easy enough to do but it does mean that the method is not strictly Finite Volume, and therefore does not retain nice conservation properties, in case we have them. I think we would like Oceananigans.jl to use finite volume methods, not finite difference methods. Perhaps @ali-ramadhan and @christophernhill can comment as well. We can use a 4th order finite volume methods instead of a 4th order finite different method to obtain 4th order convergence without resorting to a finite difference method. We already have 4th-order interpolation of fields, so the only missing piece for a fully 4th-order method is 4th-order interpolation of field gradients... ? I believe we know how to do 4th order interpolation of gradients via comments in PR #1806. We probably cannot support a 4th-order treatment of pressure for `IncompressibleModel` in the near future. The reason is that the FFT-based method we use to solve the pressure Poisson equation for `IncompressibleModel` explicitly requires 2nd-order discretization of pressure. We do not have an alternative implementation of a pressure Poisson solver for arbitrary-order methods. When we have a hydrostatic pressure solver for the 3D equations, a high-order pressure discretization could be interesting to explore. Alternatively, we could add a more general method for solving the pressure Poisson equation. But this is a non-trivial amount of work. I think the principal challenge of a high-order implementation is code design. The finite volume stencils themselves are not so hard to write down. But I think we want a clean code design that minimizes bugs and maximizes the utility of the high-order stencil.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1265#issuecomment-744468361:3298,down,down,3298,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1265#issuecomment-744468361,1,['down'],['down']

I think this is the only part that I'm confused about. Why was not interpolating `z_dot_g_b` okay?. I ran some tests to investigate this and found some interesting things. As a background: when we originally tried to nuke the pressure separation, I noticed that some wave noise was being created. Unfortunately the videos of that PR were lost in time so I can't show them to you, but here is the relevant comment: https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1910#issuecomment-995840271. The worst offender was the internal wave example, where the wave packet seemed to break down pretty quickly without a hydrostatic pressure separation. So I just ran the same example using the `main` branch and branch https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/tc/nhpressure2 (which now has this bugfix in and it doesn't separate the pressure). I ran it for 10 times longer and here are the videos of both (respectively):. https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13205162/233692840-edd9780b-dbc4-4958-843d-9895ac85c32f.mp4. https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13205162/233692959-841c2a2c-2a8a-40e2-9448-fa2943a67502.mp4. They look exactly the same to me. So whatever was causing the added wave noise in https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1910 when we removed the hydrostatic pressure (whether it was the things you changed in this PR or not), it's not causing the noise anymore.

Availability,"aves. In other words, if particles and thus fluid undergo some net drift, then some external mean force must have imparted mean momentum to the fluid. So the first sentence of the Wikipedia article misleads. It's easy to get this wrong because in many systems the mean dynamics are ""trivial"" and do not evolve. But this is not always the case... The reason this subject is so tricky is because the physics of surface gravity waves _require_ a transfer of mean momentum from some external agent if they are excited (this is part of what it means for a wave field to have pseudomomentum). Thus the forced growth of waves is _also_ associated with a transfer of mean momentum (from the atmosphere to the ocean). But the mean momentum so transferred is not by any reasonable definition a ""wave property""; it undergoes an independent evolution and is easily divorced from wave fields that propagate rapidly away. In particular, if the system is rotating, the mean momentum excites a stationary inertial oscillation that has no net transport over long periods of time (while the wave field happily propagates ad infinitum)... Not that Wikipedia was always right before this on every topic --- but the view on Wikipedia is the same one that's taught in classrooms. I think users know _mathematically_ what is indicated by the keyword `stokes_drift`, especially if we well-document the fact that we solve for the Lagrangian-mean velocity. That's probably the most important thing. Buhler (2014) provides a good perspective on these issues, but doesn't really directly attack the primary conceptual error here (perhaps because such an attack is politically unpopular). I also am publishing a paper on this topic... https://glwagner.github.io/assets/pdf/near-inertial-waves-turbulence-growth-swell-preprint.pdf. I'm not sure this point matters much practically, but I think it might not be responsible to let it slide by without discussion.

Availability,"because we have to taper _inside_ the `R` terms, if we just taper outside it will not have the intended effect. This is because `bz` is very small (can go down to 1e-20) so calculating the slope is quite a delicate operation. In a realistic simulation (as this one) it can well be (and it happens) that bz changes of 4-5 orders of magnitude between face and centers. Especially because our horizontal mesh is very coarse. This means that the taper factor (which is always calculated at centers) does not ""see"" the actual slope that you calculate in the rotation tensor, leaving you with R factors of the order of 1e10.

Availability,"but then the function is applied in `mapreduce` (basically you sum `f(vector[i])`) so in this case, if we pass `f(get_neutral_mask(Base.$(reduction!))` to mask places we want to exclude, then we would sum over `f(f(get_neutral_mask(Base.$(reduction!)))` which is not the same as `f(f⁻¹(get_neutral_mask(Base.$(reduction!))) == get_neutral_mask(Base.$(reduction!)` which is what we want. As a practical example if we use `mask = f(get_neutral_mask(Base.$(reduction!))` in case of a sum and `f(x) = x +1` we would have `sum(f, c, mask = 1, condition = (i, j, k, grid, c) -> i < Nx/2)`. Then we would subsitute `1` where `condition == true` and this would effectively add `2` for each `i >= Nx/2` (`f(mask)`). We would like to have `mask = -1` which is `f⁻¹(x)` but that is not really possible as we don't know `f⁻¹(x)` for each `f(x)` a-priori.

Availability,"ce to provide but I can describe the problem as I've seen it. Basically, very rare, subtle irregularities have been observed on the GPU when using `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` in a `Periodic, Bounded, Bounded` configuration. I think that it is possible the main issue is an interaction (a read-write race condition) associated with both impenetrable boundary conditions and periodic boundary conditions that affects the 8 corner points. The race condition affects model trajectories via the Coriolis force (which is the only term as far as I know that touches the 8 ""corner"" points affected by this race condition). Because the race condition only manifests when a `Coriolis` or `VectorInvariant` stencil touches corner points, it may not affect _most_ `Periodic, Periodic, Bounded` models, which could explain why we haven't caught it. The reason it doesn't affect those models is because this race condition would only affect the corner points of `w`, which are not touched when using an `FPlane` Coriolis model. However, it's possible (I'm not sure) that the race condition could affect models using `NonTraditionalFPlane` in `Periodic, Periodic, Bounded` configurations. More generally, it will also affect models that are bounded in the `y`-direction, because in those models the corner points of the `y`-velocity are affected and also invoked when using `FPlane` or `BetaPlane` coriolis. That's as much as I know. It's very hard to gather information about this bug because it's so rare are subtle. In other words, only one grid point among 10,000 iterations might be affected, and the errors induced are very small.

I would even argue from an economic standpoint that the productivity saved from this setting outweights any rare instances of lost data, if they actually would ever occur due to changing the default. Now it is clear. If we handle properly picking up simulations, I completely agree with you that best option is for the user to manually change `overwrite_existing=false` to ensure their own data. I also follow the same workflow when creating a simulation in which I rely on the `overwrite_existing=true` until I reach the ""production"" phase of the simulation. > Also curious --- do you split files to make them easier to download? . I mostly do it to keep a consistent size and chunks across files for post-processing, but supporting both things will make the user workflow more flexible, particularly when running long simulations with multiple pickups.

Availability,"consider the tilted bottom boundary layer example: https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/literated/tilted_bottom_boundary_layer/. In this problem, the buoyancy is decomposed ($b=\bar{b} + b^{\prime}$) into a background component $\bar{b} = N^{2} \hat{z}$ (where $\hat{z}$ is positive in the direction opposite the gravitational vector) and the remaining perturbation. The current example script applies no boundary conditions to the perturbation buoyancy, which I believe defaults to a no-normal-flux condition at the top and bottom boundary. Because no boundary conditions are applied to the background field, there is an implied diffusive flux $\hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot (-\kappa \nabla \bar{b}) = ±\kappa N^{2} \cos{\theta}$ across these boundaries. This means that the boundary condition on the total buoyancy is a non-zero flux across the seafloor, which does not make much sense for this problem. The normal way of implementing this problem is to apply a gradient boundary condition, $\frac{\partial b^{\prime}}{\partial z} = -N^{2}\cos{\theta}$, at the bottom, to impose the no-flux condition. (In my MITgcm configurations, I verified that implementing the boundary condition this way recovered the classical analytical solutions of [Garrett et al. 1993](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.fl.25.010193.001451). Here is [another example using Dedalus](https://github.com/hdrake/bmli-linear/blob/main/examples/evp_replicate_Wenegrat2018_growth_rates.ipynb) to replicate some of Jacob Wenegrat's results, where I also include a non-zero gradient boundary condition on the perturbation buoyancy to impose no flux on the total buoyancy.). I understand why one might want background fields to be constructed a certain way for idealized problems, but it should be communicated clearly (and consistently) to the user exactly how this works. Is the tilted bottom boundary layer example incorrectly implemented or do I still not understand how the background fields work?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3568#issuecomment-2083158198:1263,recover,recovered,1263,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3568#issuecomment-2083158198,2,['recover'],['recovered']

Question: where is the bottleneck that reduces the global spatial accuracy from double to single precision?. This third figure shows the result for increased spatial resolution and we observe that the higher order methods saturate near `1e-16`, as you would expect from double precision. ![convergence_rates](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8239041/103028959-c7514d00-4526-11eb-94c6-81fb3d429882.png).

Availability,"d specify what they want the two tangential and 1 normal direction to be instead of (u,v,w) specifically. Right, this is what I mean by having an ""abstraction for vectors"" --- awesome! If the momentum equation is treated in vector form then the three components are coupled. User specification is then on the vector momentum equation; users will specify `VelocityBoundaryConditions` (rather than boundary conditions for each component, and `VectorForcing`, rather than forcing on each component. It may also make sense to coalesce the kernels that compute tendencies for each velocity component (but I'm less sure about that). Either way this is a major change to the API at the very least, but probably necessary and something we also need for complex domains for GCM simulations, like the cubed sphere. > the original idea was to infer Flux from Gradient. This makes sense for a continuous immersed boundary where it's not possible to _discretely_ specify fluxes. If we can't discretely specify fluxes, we have to rely on a diffusivity extracted from the specified turbulence closure. This is simple for closures that have isotropic diffusivities, but gets more complicated for closures with anisotropic / tensor diffusivities. Even worse is supporting flux boundary conditions for the case that a closure doesn't use a diffusivity at all... Note also that flux boundary conditions are used almost exclusively except for direct numerical simulation, so this is indeed an important consideration. > I know this is a little different than the fitted version, because it's a little harder to specify a normal direction in that case,. For `GridFittedImmersedBoundary` the normal direction can be easily and efficiently inferred from the masking function by evaluating it at offset `i`, `j`, `k`. If fluid is adjacent to solid in any of those directions, you are on a boundary with a normal in the `x, y, z` direction (respectively), and the sign of the normal direction can be inferred from the offset.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-850559517:2111,mask,masking,2111,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-850559517,2,['mask'],['masking']

Looking at the behavior of `AveragedField` I think we should not `dropdim` when doing the average anymore since `AveragedField` always returns a 3D array:. ```julia; julia> bmean = AveragedField(b, dims=(1, 2)); AveragedField over dims=(1, 2) located at (⋅, ⋅, Center) of Field located at (Center, Center, Center); ├── data: OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64,3,Array{Float64,3}}, size: (1, 1, 20); ├── grid: RegularRectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Bounded, Bounded}(Nx=1, Ny=1024, Nz=16); ├── dims: (1, 2); ├── operand: Field located at (Center, Center, Center); └── status: time=0.0. julia> bmean.data; 1×1×20 OffsetArray(::Array{Float64,3}, 1:1, 1:1, -1:18) with eltype Float64 with indices 1:1×1:1×-1:18:; [:, :, -1] =; 0.0.

The second time-step is when QuasiAdamsBashforth2 uses tendency information saved from the previous time-step. On the first time-step it's equivalent to a forward Euler scheme. I know the differences are small, 8th decimal place or so, but on such a coarse grid should we be expecting the same answers?. Hardware differences can produce results that differ by something like sqrt(eps(Float64)) I think. This is the tolerance we use for regression tests (but even those sometimes fail to pass on the GPU for some reason). Since the background buoyancy field has a linear gradient and your domain is bounded, can you try running the same simulation but explicitly resolving the background buoyancy field?

As an example, we can consider a simple implementation. ```julia; struct AdvectiveFlux{S, D, C, G}; u :: D; v :: D; w :: D; c :: C; grid :: G; scheme :: S; end. getindex(adv::AdvectiveFlux{Centered}, i, j, k) = # centered advective flux calculation. struct IsotropicDiffusiveFlux{N, D, G}; ν :: N; ψ :: D; grid :: G; end. getindex(diff::IsotropicDiffusiveFlux, i, j, k) = # calculates flux due to isotropic diffusion by ν. struct RightHandSide{F, V}; fluxes :: F; volume_terms :: V; end. advection = AdvectiveFlux(velocities..., tracers.c); diffusion = IsotropicDiffusiveFlux(ν, tracers.c). tracer_rhs = RightHandSide((advection, diffusion), nothing); ```.

Obviously questions of performance are paramount, though in the case that _everything_ is inlined I think there is hope. A downside of this approach is that we can't use shared memory stencils on the GPU. Shared memory stencils on the GPU require _functions_ for all terms that avoid carrying around internal references to data (since we need to be able to pass them references to shared memory blocks, rather than references to global memory. This is a fair rewrite of the code internals. For example, each term in the `u_velocity_tendency`:. https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/8e3c27504be68ca06bacc7502cd6095ae390f8c6/src/TimeSteppers/velocity_and_tracer_tendencies.jl#L24. would get it's own type.

Availability,"e than ""regularization"". Note also that as formulated, $\delta$ has units of $1 / \mathrm{length}^2$. But maybe we should write the code so that the ""regularization"" has units length^2, or even just length. On the other hand the interpretation of ""regularization"" as an eigenvalue is nice. The choice of `regularization` affects the rate of convergence of the CG iteration. Note that the eigenvalues of the Poisson operator all scale with $1 / \Delta^2$, where $\Delta$ is the grid spacing (for highly anisotropic grids, take the finer direction for this scaling argument). Empirically I found that `regularization=1` works best for the MWE above though, which is a bit larger than the inverse grid spacing squared. The regularization seems to stabilize the CG iteration, so that we can iterate all the way to `maxiter`. Disappointingly though the convergence with `FlatExtrapolationOpenBoundaryCondition` is still very slow. Also interesting is that because the convergence is so slow, the difference in error / divergence between `maxiter=N^3` and `maxiter=10` is not great. Here's an example screen shot using `regularization=1` and `maxiter=N^3=4096`:. ```julia; julia> include(""mwe.jl""); [ Info: Initializing simulation...; Iter: 0, time: 0.0, Δt: 1.10e-01, max|δ|: 0.00e+00, mean(p): 0.00e+00, solver iterations: 0, max|r|: 0.00e+00; [ Info: ... simulation initialization complete (2.976 seconds); [ Info: Executing initial time step...; [ Info: ... initial time step complete (9.965 seconds).; Iter: 1, time: 0.1, Δt: 1.10e-01, max|d|: 4.17e-04, mean(p): -5.98e-03, solver iterations: 4096, max|r|: 6.97e-03; Iter: 2, time: 0.2, Δt: 1.10e-01, max|d|: 6.88e-04, mean(p): 3.33e-03, solver iterations: 4096, max|r|: 2.21e-02; Iter: 3, time: 0.3, Δt: 1.10e-01, max|d|: 5.67e-04, mean(p): -4.26e-03, solver iterations: 4096, max|r|: 1.12e-02; ```. Above `d` is the divergence and `r` is the residual of the Poisson equation. But then with `maxiter=10`,. ```julia; julia> include(""mwe.jl""); [ Info: I",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3848#issuecomment-2420098775:2497,error,error,2497,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3848#issuecomment-2420098775,1,['error'],['error']

We need values for the grid coordinates `λᶜᶠᵃ`, `λᶠᶜᵃ`, `φᶜᶠᵃ`, and `φᶠᶜᵃ` so that we can use `set!` for velocities on the cubed sphere. They are not provided by the file but we should be able to convert the available coordinates back to the cubed sphere face in (ξ, η) coordinates where -1 ≤ ξ, η ≤ 1 which forms a regular grid then interpolate in between and back to the sphere to get the other staggered grid coordinates.

My actual production code is far too complicated to paste here, but the relevant forcings I'm using there are:. ```julia; const z₀ = -100; const z₂ = -120; const z₁ = -grid.Lz. @inline function bottom_mask_cos(x, y, z); if z₀ >= z > z₁; return 1/2 * (1 - cos( π*(z-z₀)/(z₁-z₀) )); elseif z₁ >= z #> z₂; return 1.0; else; return 0.0; end ; end. @inline sponge_u(x, y, z, t, u, p) = -bottom_mask_cos(x, y, z) * p.σ * u; @inline sponge_v(x, y, z, t, v, p) = -bottom_mask_cos(x, y, z) * p.σ * v; @inline sponge_w(x, y, z, t, w, p) = -bottom_mask_cos(x, y, z) * p.σ * w; @inline sponge_b(x, y, z, t, b, p) = -bottom_mask_cos(x, y, z) * p.σ * (b - b∞(0, 0, z, 0, p)).

The above are the forcing functions, and below is the background field. There are also parameters passed for the boundary conditions. ```julia; @inline b_bg(x, y, z, t, p) = p.M² * x; B_field = BackgroundField(b_bg, parameters = (; params.M²)); ```. Changing things so that variables that are currently passed as parameters are set as `const`ants helps (as you can see I did with `z₀`, etc.). However, that also means I can't run back-to-back simulations where those parameters differ, which is something that makes my workflow way more streamlined, so I'm trying to avoid that.

This lets us increase the resolution and reduce the diffusivity, which is neat. It's a bit more turbulent now.

Arrays are needed only if we need to mutate elements or perform linear algebra.; > * Don't import CUDA because the example wasn't GPU friendly anyways (if you like, we can make it GPU friendly but I don't think it should be ""partially"" GPU friendly since it just makes the code more complicated). I tried to make it 100% GPU friendly actually (although I didn't test it). You already pointed out one flaw, which is the use of an array instead of a tuple for the unit vertical vector. > * When I try to run the example multiple times I get `ERROR: LoadError: NetCDF error: Permission denied (NetCDF error code: 13)`. How can we avoid this error? I think it's important that users can easily change parameters and re-run without having to manually delete a file; this is key to productivity. This only happens with me when the NetCDF file is open by another program (generally python in my case) while Julia is trying to write to it. Was that the case? If so, that's the usual behavior afaik and I don't think we can do anything on our end except inform users about it. > * This is a great inexpensive example.

Availability,"ere (not the solution of the non-linear shallow water equations). This was achieved by replacing the initial phase Rλ with the time-dependent phase Rλ−νt in Equations (143)–(146) of [Williamson et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999105800166), using the angular velocity ν given by Equation (142). The results at a resolution of 128x128 cells per panel are as follows:. - Since we prescribe the initial stream function and numerically take its derivatives to specify the initial velocities on the cubed sphere, numerical errors are present even in the initial velocities and the diagnosed initial vorticity. The vorticity error is significantly pronounced near the cubed sphere corners due to the deviation from orthogonality. For instance, in the domain's interior, the vorticity error norm is three orders of magnitude less than the vorticity norm, whereas at the corners, it is nearly the same order of magnitude.; - As the simulation progresses, the amplified error from the corners propagates into the interior as expected. After 500 time steps, the vorticity error in the interior increases from three orders of magnitude less to one order of magnitude less than the vorticity norm. I have attached panel-wise plots of the exact vorticity and the error of its numerical counterpart on the cubed sphere for the initial condition and after 500 time steps for reference. Given these circumstances, @navidcy and I are contemplating whether we should continue using the exact solution for verification in the test script or consider alternative verification methods, such as ensuring that the norm of the numerical solution of the Rossby-Haurwitz wave remains bounded within a specified range (as mentioned in the introduction to this PR). @glwagner, @simone-silvestri and @jm-c, let us know your thoughts. **Exact initial vorticity**. ![cubed_sphere_rossby_haurwitz_wave_ζ₀_exact](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/12926768/ec936d28-49e5-4da2-9f49-783e517b",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3570#issuecomment-2134152684:1193,error,error,1193,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3570#issuecomment-2134152684,1,['error'],['error']

In line 69 above you will see that I tried doing this by definig a new operator, div_UV, for partial_x U + partial_y V. This was clunky because I needed to pass variables U and V, and I had an error.

Availability,"from `Face` to `Center` in both x and z. > For instance, you could first create the model, define Ri and closure and then set! the model with this new closure and auxiliary field. Yes, your question makes a lot of sense! The reason we can't do that is because _type_ of any of the properties of `model` cannot change. This means we need to know the type of `model.closure` _before_ we build it. Another way to say this is that `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` is _concretely typed_, which means that functions of `model` can be optimized based on the types of _every_ property of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. This gives us performance advantages / reduces overhead, but also creates some limitations like: we have to define a `closure` before building model. Here's a simple example:. ```julia; julia> mutable struct Test{T}; a :: T; end. julia> t = Test(1.0); Test{Float64}(1.0). julia> t.a = 2.0; 2.0. julia> t.a = ""hi""; ERROR: MethodError: Cannot `convert` an object of type String to an object of type Float64; Closest candidates are:; convert(::Type{T}, ::T) where T<:Number at number.jl:6; convert(::Type{T}, ::Number) where T<:Number at number.jl:7; convert(::Type{T}, ::Base.TwicePrecision) where T<:Number at twiceprecision.jl:250; ...; Stacktrace:; [1] setproperty!(x::Test{Float64}, f::Symbol, v::String); @ Base ./Base.jl:34; [2] top-level scope; @ REPL[6]:1; ```. Here, `t` is `Test{Float64}`. We can change `a` as long as the new value can be converted to `Float64` via `convert(Float64, new_value)`. Otherwise we can't and we just have to write `s = Test(""hi"")` instead. Another possible solution is to build a ""dummy"" closure with the correct type, and then replace it with the ""real"" closure after constructing model by writing `model.closure = real_closure`. It could be fun to try that and see if the code is simpler. I suspect it might not be but it's worth a shot (you might learn something). . > Thinking on a more general way, it would be awesome to give a general function that ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2337#issuecomment-1066113513:1719,ERROR,ERROR,1719,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2337#issuecomment-1066113513,1,['ERROR'],['ERROR']

Availability,"h @simone-silvestri:. If you want to adapt your script to multiregion you have to:; - define a multiregion grid with: `grid = MultiRegionGrid(grid, partition = XPartition(n_gpus_you_want_to_use), devices = n_gpus_you_want_to_use)` . The multiregion grid supersedes the immersed boundary grid, i.e. if you are using an immersed boundary grid then `grid = MultiRegionGrid(ibg; kwargs...)` , not the other way around.; - if you are using any array for forcing or boundary condition, you have to adapt it to the multiregion paradigm as follows: `using Oceananigans.MultiRegion: multi_region_object_from_array; my_adapted_array = multi_region_object_from_array(my_array, grid)`. MultiRegion works only on single node multi GPU, so all the GPUs should be accessible from a single process in the node. You can check the number of GPUs available by logging in a node and typing nvidia-smi , if you want to split your grid on specific devices (let’s say GPU 0 and 3), you can pass `devices = (0, 3)` to the `MultiRegionGrid` constructor. There is another thing that you have to take care of: the pressure solve is performed on one GPU only so both the storage and source term (a field of complex values of the size of the full grid) reside on 1 GPU only (usually the one corresponding to the last region). This means that if your grid is 100M points, 2.98 GB will have to be reserved for the solver’s auxiliary fields; ```julia; julia> sizeof(complex(zeros(Int(100e6)))) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 * 2; 2.9802322387695312; ```; So make sure you have that space available. (When I have time I ll try to find a solution to run truly parallel pressure solvers, for both nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic models). In terms of outputs, we make use of `reconstruct_global_field` , a function used to reconstruct a global field from a `MultiRegionField` on the CPU. It is used by the output writers to spit out the full field.

Availability,"hat sometimes `model` has to use a very tiny time-step to bridge the gap between the current time and the output time? If so, that's an interesting possibility that I hadn't considered. Although in the example above I'm fixing the time-step at `25`, while the output time interval is `200`, so I wouldn't expect any issues there. Can you check just to be sure? Because having an output interval that's some multiple of the time step is exactly when we expect to see miniscule time-steps due to round off error. The pressure source term is the divergence of the predictor velocity divided by time-step. As the time-step vanishes, the divergence of the predictor velocity also vanishes (because the flow has not evolved from its previous, non-divergent solution). We get a situation tending to 0/0. I think there's a few things we could do to solve this. First of all if we take a very small time-step, I think we can actually just re-set the model time rather than taking a time-step. Second I am wondering if we want to implement a time type that has finite resolution (ie there is a smallest time increment one can take). For example, datetimes have a smallest unit (micro or nanoseconds). A non-dimensional or dimensional-agnostic time type could also be designed analogously (eg every time is the multiple of an integer by the fundamental unit). This would eliminate round off error but it's a bit of work and also we have to put some thought into how best to accomplish it. There might also be a simpler solution by adjusting how we increment time. I'm not sure. > Also wouldn't that also affect simulations with `buoyancy=nothing` if the pre-output time-step were to blame?. I think so, but I also don't think that you can guarantee this problem won't ever occur. The presence of the buoyancy does somehow impact the divergence that accumulates during a time-step / the pressure correction that has to be applied. So it's possible that the buoyancy configuration affects these results. Not sure.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3593#issuecomment-2103013025:1761,error,error,1761,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3593#issuecomment-2103013025,2,['error'],['error']
Availability,"he source code. As for the source code and the topic of this issue, I think it will be generally impossible to include the diffusivity fields in the model fields. First of all, closures and diffusivity fields can be user defined. We want people to be free to do creative things in closure design without having to worry about whether trying to merge the diffusivity fields into `model_fields` will cause their model to fail to compile, preventing them from doing work. However, it might be possible to ""whitelist"" some fields when the situation calls for it, like the eddy diffusivities in LES closures. For that we need to introduce a new function, something like `nonhydrostatic_fields` (mirroring the `hydrostatic_fields` we have now for the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`) which, unlike `fields`, is more low-level and not user facing. Then this function can be designed to take `closure` as an argument to support the inclusion of diffusivity fields where appropriate, something like. ```julia; @inline nonhydrostatic_model_fields(closure, velocities, tracers, aux_fields, diffusivity_fields) =; merge(velocities, tracers, aux_fields) # fallback. @inline nonhydrostatic_model_fields(::SmagorinskyLilly, velocities, tracers, aux_fields, diffusivity_fields) =; merge(velocities, tracers, aux_fields, (; νₑ=diffusivity_fields.νₑ)) # desired behavior; ```. then we can use that in the tendency kernel functions. I think this would probably succeed because we can simply omit the closures with too-complex diffusivity fields. It might require a bit more work for closure tuples though. It's an interesting idea for a contribution. But note that the current ways to solve this problem (creating a new field for the forcing, and then utilizing callbacks to compute the needed field during time stepping) are fairly straightforward and also generalize to much more complex situations that I'm not sure it makes sense to go down the rabbit hole of extending `model_fields` to cover more exotic situations.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3582#issuecomment-2095180262:2426,down,down,2426,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3582#issuecomment-2095180262,2,['down'],['down']

Availability,"iguration/. * Configuring SLURM correctly may also require some trial and error, because the documentation is unclear and there are a huge number of options. I can't figure out if the documentation is wrong, in fact, or if instead the engaging cluster does not support some options. Either way, a small test script like. ```julia; using MPI. MPI.Init(); @show MPI.Comm_rank(MPI.COMM_WORLD); @show MPI.Comm_size(MPI.COMM_WORLD); ```. Is helpful for debugging. Also, I recommend first trying to start jobs interactively before using `sbatch`. Interactive jobs launch faster, so we get a faster trial-error iteration. I'm still working on things, but it seems like another point may be salient:. * Initialize / precompile outside of a parallel job before trying to launch a parallel job via `mpiexec`. Here are some notes that may be specific to engaging:. I'm using `srun` to get a 4-GPU node to use interactively:. ```; srun -p my_partition --tasks-per-node=4 --cpus-per-task=32 --gres=gpu:4 --gpus-per-node=4 --mem=0 -t 01:00:00 -N 1; ```. it seems we have to use the option `gpus-per-node`, rather than setting the total number of GPUs. Also we redundantly also have to specify `gres=gpu:4` (`gres` stands for ""generalized resource""). Why `gres` can't tell what `gpus-per-node` is, I don't know. `-N 1` means 1 node. Finally we also have to specify ``--tasks-per-node=4` (matching `gres` _and_ the number of GPUs per node), otherwise we cannot launch `mpiexec` with 4 tasks (1 for each GPU). It's helpful to have the maximum number of CPUs for precompilation. Otherwise precompilation is very slow. I also set. ```; export JULIA_NUM_PRECOMPILE_TASKS=64; ```. (half the total) --- adapt for your system. Here is also a small test script for debuggin Oceananigans:. ```julia; using Oceananigans; arch = Distributed(GPU()); @show arch; ```. as a side note, it would be nice if we could print to the screen from different ranks without them talking over one another. It makes it hard to read the output.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3698#issuecomment-2389107436:1713,redundant,redundantly,1713,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3698#issuecomment-2389107436,2,['redundant'],['redundantly']

Using a `CFL` of `51` (`Nx = 50` in this case) reproduces the error on a CPU:; ```; [ Info: Initializing simulation...; [ Info: ... simulation initialization complete (108.842 ms); [ Info: Executing initial time step...; [ Info: ... initial time step complete (3.303 seconds).; ERROR: LoadError: BoundsError: attempt to access 56×56×56 OffsetArray(::Array{Float64, 3}, -2:53, -2:53, -2:53) with eltype Float64 with indices -2:53×-2:53×-2:53 at index [54, 49, 1]; Stacktrace:; [1] throw_boundserror(A::OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64, 3, Array{Float64, 3}}, I::Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64}); @ Base ./abstractarray.jl:744; [2] checkbounds; @ ./abstractarray.jl:709 [inlined]; [3] getindex; @ ~/.julia/packages/OffsetArrays/0MOrf/src/OffsetArrays.jl:420 [inlined]; [4] getindex; @ ~/Documents/IdealizedOceanWorlds.jl/OceananigansMemeoryIssue.jl/dev/Oceananigans/src/Fields/field.jl:399 [inlined]; [5] getindex; @ ~/Documents/IdealizedOceanWorlds.jl/OceananigansMemeoryIssue.jl/dev/Oceananigans/src/Utils/sum_of_arrays.jl:23 [inlined]; [6] _interpolate; @ ~/Documents/IdealizedOceanWorlds.jl/OceananigansMemeoryIssue.jl/dev/Oceananigans/src/Fields/interpolate.jl:148 [inlined]; [7] interpolate; @ ~/Documents/IdealizedOceanWorlds.jl/OceananigansMemeoryIssue.jl/dev/Oceananigans/src/Fields/interpolate.jl:197 [inlined]; [8] advect_particle; @ ~/Documents/IdealizedOceanWorlds.jl/OceananigansMemeoryIs",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3320#issuecomment-1773032135:1041,ERROR,ERROR,1041,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3320#issuecomment-1773032135,1,['ERROR'],['ERROR']

Without immersed boundaries, this is pretty straightforward.

The call to `zspacing()` goes through some metaprogramming [here](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/56fc69bcb08623424afe25e39ae616c29208095e/src/Operators/spacings_and_areas_and_volumes.jl#L247-L269) but ultimately also directly accesses the `grid`'s `Δzᵃᵃᶜ` property here:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/56fc69bcb08623424afe25e39ae616c29208095e/src/Operators/spacings_and_areas_and_volumes.jl#L104-L112. ---. ### Current behavior for `ImmersedBoundaryGrid`. For the same grid wrapped around an `ImmersedBoundaryGrid` on `main`, when calling `zspacings()` we get the error at the top comment (`MethodError: no method matching`; which this PR aims to fix). The call to `zspacing()` works the same way as with `RectilinearGrid`, with the exception of an extra dispatch [here](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/56fc69bcb08623424afe25e39ae616c29208095e/src/ImmersedBoundaries/immersed_grid_metrics.jl#L16-L31). ---. ### Summary of the PR as of this post. This PR is originally trying to fix the issue with `zspacings(::IBG)` simply by adding. ```julia; zspacings(grid::IBG, args...; kwargs...) = zspacings(grid.underlying_grid, args...; kwargs...); ```. If I understand correctly, @glwagner's point is that this is wrong in cases where cells have a fraction of ""wet"" volume and a fraction of ""immersed solid"" volume. (For now the two such cases in sight are `PartialCellBottom` and `CutCellBottom` (for which there's open PR https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3146).).

Availability,"irections `Vertical` and `Horizontal`, since those names are pretty intuitive and play well with already-defined terms like `VerticallyImplicit` (which are also intuitive and widely used in the literature). The downside to this option, if we were to follow (2), appears as an inconsistency whenever we tilt the domain and need to use `buoyancy = Buoyancy(model=BuoyancyTracer(), vertical_unit_vector=ĝ)` (`ĝ` being a unit vector). So we could end up with a case where the vertical direction is implicitly defined as being tilted 45 degrees (by means of `Buoyancy`), but for `ScalarDiffusivity` `Vertical` will still mean the `z` direction, which is confusing. Furthermore, the default option for buoyancy would be called `buoyancy = Buoyancy(model=BuoyancyTracer(), vertical_unit_vector=Vertical())`, which is not helpful. ### Option 2. Second option is to change the notation to what I proposed here: `XYDirection` etc., which avoids this inconsistency. The downside is that it doesn't play well with terms like `VerticallyImplicit` anymore. Something we either would have to live with, or we'd need to change those terms as well (something like `ZImplicit` isn't wrong, but it's not what people generally call it). ### Option 3. We could also keep the names `Vertical` etc., but change the interface of `Buoyancy` so that it doesn't implicitly define that the vertical direction is. So instead of having the interface be. `buoyancy = Buoyancy(model=BuoyancyTracer(), vertical_unit_vector=ĝ)`. it would be something like. `buoyancy = Buoyancy(model=BuoyancyTracer(), direction_antiparallel_to_gravity=ĝ)`. which is equally correct and doesn't assume that ""vertical"" is connected to the direction of gravity. The issue here is that the name `direction_antiparallel_to_gravity` is super long. ### Option 4. @simone-silvestri raised an interesting point that these aren't just ""directions"" they are also different formulations. In light of this, it might make sense to not do (2).

Availability,"kernel function `fourier_tridiagonal_preconditioner_rhs!` is being called with the wrong arguments. For example:. ```julia; julia> f(x, y) = x + y; f (generic function with 1 method). julia> f(1); ERROR: MethodError: no method matching f(::Int64). Closest candidates are:; f(::Any, ::Any); @ Main REPL[1]:1. Stacktrace:; [1] top-level scope; @ REPL[2]:1; ```. The stacktrace shows. ```; [8] compute_preconditioner_rhs!(solver::Oceananigans.Solvers.FourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver{…}, rhs::Field{…}); @ Oceananigans.Solvers ~/.julia/packages/Oceananigans/HPOLD/src/Solvers/conjugate_gradient_poisson_solver.jl:109; ```. let's look at that line:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/6c40d7e225c2127051b2703b9c62a8b18260e3a5/src/Solvers/conjugate_gradient_poisson_solver.jl#L109-L110. This uses the Oceananigans utility `launch!` which launches the kernel `fourier_tridiagonal_preconditioner_rhs!` with the arguments `solver.storage, tridiagonal_dir, rhs`. However, looking at the function `fourier_tridiagonal_preconditioner_rhs` a few lines above. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/6c40d7e225c2127051b2703b9c62a8b18260e3a5/src/Solvers/conjugate_gradient_poisson_solver.jl#L93. we see that the function has 4 arguments, not 3. Hence the error. To summarize the analysis method, the key is to find the function that causes the error in the source code (`fourier_tridiagonal_preconditioner_rhs`) and then identify where it is called, and how it should be called. Here's an updated MWE from your nice one @liuchihl :. ```julia; using Oceananigans; using Oceananigans.Solvers: ConjugateGradientPoissonSolver, fft_poisson_solver. N = 2; x = y = (0, 1); z = [0, 0.2, 1]; grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(N, N, N); x, y, z, halo=(2, 2, 2), topology=(Bounded, Periodic, Bounded)); fft_solver = fft_poisson_solver(grid); pressure_solver = ConjugateGradientPoissonSolver(grid, preconditioner=fft_poisson_solver(grid)); model = NonhydrostaticModel(; grid, pressure_solver); set!(model, u=1); ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3896#issuecomment-2453118576:1717,error,error,1717,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3896#issuecomment-2453118576,2,['error'],['error']

(Also note this doesn't work with `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` apparently... we need to fix that.). One downside of this method is that it precludes `VerticallyImplicitTimeDiscretization()`: because we use a predictor-corrector method for implicit time discretization, diffusivities that are treated implicitly _must_ be precomputed. ## Subtleties. There's more. There are subtleties peculiar to using `Ri` in a closure, because `Ri` easily becomes NaN when both the buoyancy gradient and shear are zero. The usual solution to this for ocean modeling is to use the ""hack"" that 0/0 = 0. In other words, NaNs are intercepted and set to 0. There are again a few solutions to this. One is simply to set all `NaN` to zero in side the function that computes `Ri`, eg. ```julia; u, v, w = model.velocities; b = model.tracers.b; Ri_op = @at (Center, Center, Center) ∂z(b) / (∂z(u)^2 + ∂z(v)^2). """""" Compute the Richardson number and store in `Ri`. """"""; function compute_Ri!(sim); Ri .= Ri_op. # Zero out NaNs; Ri_parent = parent(Ri); parent(Ri_parent)[isnan.(Ri_parent)] .= 0. fill_halo_regions!(Ri, sim.model.architecture); return nothing; end; ```. Other possibilities are 1) use `ConditionalOperation` to intercept `0/0` ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2337#issuecomment-1065995186:3588,down,downside,3588,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2337#issuecomment-1065995186,2,['down'],['downside']

Availability,"lse` can be excluded from the reduction. . (probably not the right place to say it but I see now that we might have a problem with specific functions, for example `maximum(abs, field, condition = something) = Inf`. We probably should mask after the function is applied). An example is here; ```; julia> grid = RectilinearGrid(arch, size = (4, 1, 1), extent = (1, 1, 1)); RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded}; architecture: CPU(); domain: x ∈ [0.0, 1.0], y ∈ [0.0, 1.0], z ∈ [-1.0, 0.0]; topology: (Periodic, Periodic, Bounded); size (Nx, Ny, Nz): (4, 1, 1); halo (Hx, Hy, Hz): (1, 1, 1); spacing in x: Regular, with spacing 0.25; spacing in y: Regular, with spacing 1.0; spacing in z: Regular, with spacing 1.0. julia> field = Field{Center, Center, Center}(grid); Field located at (Center, Center, Center); ├── data: OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64, 3, Array{Float64, 3}}, size: (4, 1, 1); ├── grid: RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded}(Nx=4, Ny=1, Nz=1); └── boundary conditions: west=Periodic, east=Periodic, south=Periodic, north=Periodic, bottom=ZeroFlux, top=ZeroFlux, immersed=ZeroFlux. julia> set!(field, [1, 2, 3, 4]). julia> sum(field); 10.0. julia> sum(field, condition = field .> 2); 7.0. julia> sum(field, condition = field .> 2, mask = 100); 207.0. julia> sum(field, condition = (i, j, k, grid, field) -> grid.xᶜᵃᵃ[i] < 0.3); 1.0; ```. A `ConditionalOperation` just contains the ""operand"" to reduce (might be an `AbstractField` or an `AbstractOperation`), a grid, the condition (which can be a `Function` or an `AbstractArray`), and the `mask` (which at the moment is just a number). You can construct it with `condition_operand(field, condition, mask)`. But most of the time you probably won't need it (reductions automatically construct a `ConditionalOperation` when specifying a condition through the keyword argument). @glwagner `condition_operand` is used because we needed to define it in `Fields.jl` which is added before `AbstractOperations.jl`",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2185#issuecomment-1022269235:1702,mask,mask,1702,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2185#issuecomment-1022269235,3,['mask'],['mask']

Availability,"nd of this comment\) that demonstrates this. The residual keeps oscillating \(see the attached figure\). Besides, if we add a small random perturbation to `b` so that `Ax = b` does not have a solution \(this line is commented out for the figure shown below), the residual can grow over time and become larger than 1e4. There are two potential solutions:. 1. Modify the CG method to make it numerically stably for positive semi-definite matrices; 2. Apply the CG method to another matrix that is positive definite and gives the same solution. My method belongs to the second category. I create a new matrix. $$\tilde{A} = A + cv_0v_0^\dagger$$. where $c$ is a positive real number and $v_0$ is the basis of the null space of $A$. In contrast, enforcing the zero mean belongs to the first category. It definitely helps, since the CG method will likely blow up if the mean is not zero \(which means there is no solution\). However, dealing with round-off errors is always tricky, especially in this case where fast convergence leads to a rapid decrease in the ""signal-to-error ratio"". . ```Python; import numpy as np; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt. def gram_schmidt(X, row_vecs=True, norm = True):; if not row_vecs:; X = X.T; Y = X[0:1,:].copy(); for i in range(1, X.shape[0]):; proj = np.diag((X[i,:].dot(Y.T)/np.linalg.norm(Y,axis=1)**2).flat).dot(Y); Y = np.vstack((Y, X[i,:] - proj.sum(0))); if norm:; Y = np.diag(1/np.linalg.norm(Y,axis=1)).dot(Y); if row_vecs:; return Y; else:; return Y.T. def cg_solve(A,b,N):. x = np.zeros_like(b). r = b - A.dot(x). p = r.copy(). rs = []. for i in range(N):. rs.append(np.linalg.norm(r)).

Availability,"ndent phase Rλ−νt in Equations (143)–(146) of [Williamson et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999105800166), using the angular velocity ν given by Equation (142). The results at a resolution of 128x128 cells per panel are as follows:. - Since we prescribe the initial stream function and numerically take its derivatives to specify the initial velocities on the cubed sphere, numerical errors are present even in the initial velocities and the diagnosed initial vorticity. The vorticity error is significantly pronounced near the cubed sphere corners due to the deviation from orthogonality. For instance, in the domain's interior, the vorticity error norm is three orders of magnitude less than the vorticity norm, whereas at the corners, it is nearly the same order of magnitude.; - As the simulation progresses, the amplified error from the corners propagates into the interior as expected. After 500 time steps, the vorticity error in the interior increases from three orders of magnitude less to one order of magnitude less than the vorticity norm. I have attached panel-wise plots of the exact vorticity and the error of its numerical counterpart on the cubed sphere for the initial condition and after 500 time steps for reference. Given these circumstances, @navidcy and I are contemplating whether we should continue using the exact solution for verification in the test script or consider alternative verification methods, such as ensuring that the norm of the numerical solution of the Rossby-Haurwitz wave remains bounded within a specified range (as mentioned in the introduction to this PR). @glwagner, @simone-silvestri and @jm-c, let us know your thoughts. **Exact initial vorticity**. ![cubed_sphere_rossby_haurwitz_wave_ζ₀_exact](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/12926768/ec936d28-49e5-4da2-9f49-783e517b6f0c). **Error in initial vorticity**. ![cubed_sphere_rossby_haurwitz_wave_ζ₀_error](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/129",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3570#issuecomment-2134152684:1294,error,error,1294,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3570#issuecomment-2134152684,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"ns currently does not store intermediate terms in the computation of a PDE's right hand side (with notable exceptions hydrostatic pressure and eddy diffusivities). In other words, a single, sometimes large kernel that evaluates the right hand side at each grid point `i, j, k` is compiled for each PDE in a user's model, and there's no way to pull out intermediate steps in that calculation to use elsewhere. It's important to note when considering optimization strategies that our computations are probably memory-limited, rather than compute-limited. In other words, we think the process of transferring data from global memory to local thread memory is a bottleneck for our computations (we can really only know this through profiling a particular application, however, since all models are different...) Storing intermediate components of the tendency terms would probably create more memory accesses overall (since rather than immediately using intermediate results for subsequent calculations, we would have to send them to global memory, and then back, to complete the evaluation of a tendency) --- and thus could slow down tendency evaluations that are performed 1-3 times per time-step. For example, our best idea for speeding up tendency evaluations is to better manage memory movement using GPU shared memory (unfortunately, we haven't had the time to explore such optimization strategies...). I think there may be other ways to optimize diagnostics calculations, however. # Fusing `ComputedField` kernels. One possibility to speed up diagnostics is to ""fuse"" kernels for different `ComputedField` diagnostics.

Availability,"nt changes:. * I removed the `BackgroundField` v-velocity, which had no effect on the solution because the domain is `Flat` in y. The only effect of the background flow is through the bottom drag boundary condition.; * I reduced the domain aspect ratio to 400 x 100 because based on the visualization it seemed the domain didn't need to be so wide. This lets us increase the resolution and reduce the diffusivity, which is neat. It's a bit more turbulent now. Minor changes:. * Update style to be consistent with other examples / source code (commas, spaces, etc); * Reorganized the script to read like the other examples / tutorials (like a paper, parameters are introduced when they are used rather than at the top); * Reorganized a few other misc stuff for pedagogical reasons, like building buoyancy + coriolis together; * Note using a tuple for `ĝ` rather than `Array` means it can be used as a parameter on the GPU, so that's probably preferred. Arrays are needed only if we need to mutate elements or perform linear algebra.; * Change tilting angle to 3 degrees rather than 0.05 radians; * Don't import CUDA because the example wasn't GPU friendly anyways (if you like, we can make it GPU friendly but I don't think it should be ""partially"" GPU friendly since it just makes the code more complicated); * When I try to run the example multiple times I get `ERROR: LoadError: NetCDF error: Permission denied (NetCDF error code: 13)`. How can we avoid this error? I think it's important that users can easily change parameters and re-run without having to manually delete a file; this is key to productivity; * Plotting fewer contours makes the animation faster (the most expensive part of this example); * We don't need to form `Field`s any more for the output writers any more.

Availability,"o @maleadt on the Julia slack's GPU channel and in regards to the shallow water model profiles:. > Don't focus on time spent in API calls to much. since GPU execution is asynchronous, you'll have to synchronize at some point, and that API call will then 'soak up' time until the stream has finished executing. and here that's literally the synchronize function, which is implemented using cuStreamQuery: https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/blob/2b3ec03ff9774b65541fc88dd6b0f1f7aea5d9e0/lib/cudadrv/stream.jl#L115-L144. >use a timeline profiler (i.e. NSNight Systems) to profile your app, or nvpp if you really want to use the old profiler toolchain. plain nvprof results are too simple once your application hits some level of complexity. >now, it is possible that our CPU-side implementation of synchronize does too many API calls and could be optimized a little, but in the end the call serves to wait until the GPU has finished so it probably doesn't matter much. if it does, e.g. because you want to perform other useful work on another CPU task concurrently, you could try to profile that in isolation and file an issue. Essentially, Tim explains that `cuStreamQuery` takes up more time as the grid size increases because it's called in the synchronize function. The synchronize function as shown in the link above tends to be called more and soaks up more waiting time the bigger the problem hence why it scales positively to grid size. ; Taking a closer look at the shallow water gpu profiling results above, it seems that `cuStreamQuery` takes up a lot of time in the finer resolution runs because it is called many times and not because each call takes a lot of time. For example, in the 16k case, `cuSteamQuery` is called three order of magnitudes more times than `cuLaunchKernel` while both calls are measured in microseconds. ; I'm not sure if `cuStreamQuery` being called 400,000 times is an error with our code, an error with CUDA.jl, not an error at all, or an error with my profiling.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1912#issuecomment-899945654:1916,error,error,1916,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1912#issuecomment-899945654,8,['error'],['error']
Availability,"o switch on/off different terms in the MEKE budget. For instance, as of now, MOM6 OM4 only uses the `PrognosticMEKEDiffusivity` (and no backscatter), but the CPT and others are looking into the energetically-constrained backscatter term intensively these days!; 3. **MEKE vs. GEOMETRIC**: As you mention above, the two schemes are very similar. There are maybe three notable differences: ; a) **energy type**: MEKE solves a prognostic equation for `EKE`, whereas GEOMETRIC solves a prognostic equation for `EKE + EPE`. To inform GM, the two schemes then use the variable `2 * EKE` and `EKE + EPE`, respectively. [Bachman (2017)](10.1016/j.ocemod.2016.12.004) found that in practice, kappa_GM is not sensitive to whether one solves for `EKE` (as MEKE does) or `EKE + EPE` (as GEOMETRIC does). So we could probably start by following the MEKE approach, and just solve for `EKE`.; b) **GM/energy source term**: In MEKE, it is left to the user how to specify the mixing length scale `L_mix` in `kappa_GM = c * sqrt(2 MEKE) * L_mix` and in the inferred MEKE source term. (Options are: the deformation scale, Rhines scale, grid scale, frictional halting scale, Eady length scale, or any combination of those, see [here](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MOM6/blob/0e8acd90b46656ccb7fbc73bc5911ef2733a345c/src/parameterizations/lateral/MOM_MEKE.F90#L995-L1012).) In GEOMETRIC, the mixing length scale is essentially chosen as the Eady length scale. So if you use MEKE with the Eady length scale `L_e` (see Appendix Ab in Kong and Jansen, 2021), you recover the GEOMETRIC source term.; c) **sub-grid dissipation**: MEKE assumes only bottom drag, GEOMETRIC uses one ""catch-all"" linear damping term as the energy sink term in the sub-grid energy budget. As highlighted in [Mak et al. (2022)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021GL097259), this sub-grid dissipation term is probably the big elephant in the room, which the solution is very sensitive to but noone knows what the term should look like.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2431#issuecomment-1122829692:2705,recover,recover,2705,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2431#issuecomment-1122829692,1,['recover'],['recover']

Availability,"on for our more adventurous users that want to experiment with new viscosities/diffusivities. Is the issue about what we define as ""feasible""? It's simple to add a new struct with a custom `calculate_diffusivities!`. I agree though that this could result in more boilerplate. So, the difference is really just ""how much code"" one needs to write to get to a custom `calculate_diffusivities!`. I think I would prefer a simple interface that allows users to dispatch on the type of `closure.ν`, ie something like. ```julia; calculate_diffusivities!(diffusivities, closure::ScalarDiffusivity, args...) =; calculate_diffusivities!(closure.ν, closure.κ, diffusivities, closure, args...) =; ```. Then if users have special viscosities that require computation, they can define a custom `calculate_diffusivities!(ν::MyCustomViscosity, ...)`. Another interface could un-comment these fields:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/1a288c175d07b3d4262e965c7e75376d5541e24d/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/scalar_diffusivity.jl#L117-L121. and then users can define fields with custom `compute!` definitions. If we have an interface like the one above, we may not need a separate struct for `AnisotropicMinimumDissipation` at all. It really boils down to where we put information about the closure, such as free parameters. Right now we have an interface that encourages a new struct that subtypes `AbstractScalarDiffusivity`. An alternative is to do away with ""abstract"" scalar diffusivity, and generalize the concrete `ScalarDiffusivity` to any computed viscosity / diffusivity. This would then cover cases like `AnisotropicMinimumDissipation`, and move the free parameters associated with AMD from the turbulence closure struct into the viscosity struct. The first design is ""flatter"", and therefore exposes data like free parameters a bit more. The second design is more ""hierarchical"", which reduces boilerplate but is a little bit more complex. That's the trade-off I see.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2751#issuecomment-1261037943:1653,down,down,1653,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2751#issuecomment-1261037943,2,['down'],['down']

Availability,"or is the problem ""out of memory errors""? Because the second might have to do with temporary allocations. That's a good point! I've been measuring the memory usage right after defining `model` and right before calling `run!()` (the only things in between are the definition of `simulation` and a bunch of diagnostics), but I've definitely been focusing more on the errors. Here are some numbers that I think bring some clarity:. - Using Julia 1.6 and Oceananigans 0.77.5:; - Biggest grid I can run: `997×997×96 ImmersedBoundaryGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on GPU with 4×4×4 halo`; - Memory usage right after building `model`: 19712MiB / 32768MiB; - Memory usage right before running and after adding simulation and diagnostics: 25778MiB / 32768MiB; - Using Julia 1.7 and Oceanaigans 0.78.0:; - Biggest grid I can run: `941×941×90 ImmersedBoundaryGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on GPU with 4×4×4 halo`; - Memory usage right after building `model`: 16576MiB / 32768MiB; - Memory usage right before running and after adding simulation and diagnostics: 31026MiB / 32768MiB; - Using Julia 1.8 and Oceanaigans 0.78.0:; - Biggest grid I can run: `941×941×90 ImmersedBoundaryGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on GPU with 4×4×4 halo`; - Memory usage right after building `model`: 16576MiB / 32768MiB; - Memory usage right before running and after adding simulation and diagnostics: 31026MiB / 32768MiB. Note that although Julia 1.6 + Oceananigans 0.77 ends up with the smaller memory usage in the end, it apparently uses a lot of temporary allocations because I get an out-of-memory error when adding diagnostics with bigger grids. That said, it still manages to have the smallest ""permanent"" memory usage and allows me to run larger simulations. Interesting results. The biggest difference seems to be in the allocations required for the diagnostics (or maybe `Simulation`?). I can tests without diagnostics at some point and compare the results if you agree that's useful.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2794#issuecomment-1299523285:1713,error,error,1713,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2794#issuecomment-1299523285,1,['error'],['error']

The puzzling part is how to solve the problem. I thought at first we could solve it by preventing the Manifest from being ""re-resolved"" --- perhaps by resolving it correctly during initialization? But actually, this isn't possible, since the problematic manifest in question is a temporary run that is created only for the tests (and its different from the project's manifest, because it also includes the test dependencies). This temporary test manifest can't be initialized as far as I can tell and is created independently for each test.

Availability,"pected the sponge layer to be _identically_ zero for most of the domain. Us not ""being on the same page"" here (for the lack of a better description! haha) may be due to different philosophies of what a sponge layer should be. So, due to my background, a sponge layer should be a function that _only_ acts in a _finite_ part of the domain. So, for example, in my code I set-up the sponge layer mask as. ```; mask = H(-(z-z₀)) ⋅ (z - z₀)² / (z₁ - z₀)²; ```; with H(z) being the Heaviside function. Comparing this to the Gaussian mask, this has a disadvantage of not being as smooth (although it should be smooth enough because of the (z - z₀)² / (z₁ - z₀)² term, and we can always increase the order of the exponents). However it has a very important advantage: I know _exactly_ when it stops influencing my solution. So I know that in the range `(z₀, max(z)]` my solver is solving the NS equations (plus or minus some approximations) without any added nonphysical term. I was always taught (and I still agree) that setting up a sponge layer mask as something that only reaches zero at infinity (like a Gaussian) is not recommended since you don't know when do start believing your solution. In practice if you're 4σs away from the center of the Gaussian you're pretty sure that the sponge layer influences are minimal (but they're not exactly zero!). But a harder question is: how far away is far enough?. A note here should be that if my mask was simply `mask = H(-(z-z₀))` it would probably fail as a sponge layer because, as @navidcy and @glwagner have pointed out, it would reflect a ton of waves. So the transition should be done with care. So, again, I think it boils down to your background and modeling philosophy! But it would be nice to have options for finite-range masks, such as the one I imposed, as well. (Although there are many other functions that are used and mine is probably the easiest one you can come up with...). I hope I made the issue clearer! And sorry about any confusion.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1203#issuecomment-734431314:1333,mask,mask,1333,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1203#issuecomment-734431314,5,"['down', 'mask']","['down', 'mask', 'masks']"

I think the issue here is that there are a few flavors of ""reduced fields"":. * ""Sliced fields"", which have reduced dimensionality, but still have a ""position"" in 3D space. These may be fields that exist only on boundaries, like the free surface, ice concentration, boundary conditions, etc. It should also be valid to define ""sliced fields"" at other positions / indices, inside the domain. If one of the ranges has a length 1, then the field is ""2.5 dimensional""... ?; * _Truly_ two-dimensional fields derived from a reduction operation, like `Average` or `Integral`. These fields have no position in the reduced dimension. To express the above in code, we might introduce a new location, perhaps `Level` (`Slice`, `Layer`, `Plane`...), which maybe stores both an integer `index` and the ""underlying location"". The free surface might have the location `Level{Face}(grid.Nz+1)` in the vertical (for example). I'm unsure the best solution to the masking issue. For 2.5D fields, the answer is clear: we need to evaluate `solid_interface` at the actual ""location"" of the field. Right now `Nothing` in the vertical means `k -> 1`. But this is _wrong_, as this issue identifies. If we have a new location `Level`, we can evaluate `solid_interface` at `Level.index` (for example). For truly 2D fields, it's murkier. I think in _general_ if one wants to identify whether an _entire_ dimension is masked, there's little choice but to evaluate the masking function at every index in that dimension. But there are special cases for which the job is a bit easier, because we encode assumptions about the shape of the immersed boundary. For example, `GridFittedBottom` assumes that masking occurs at every location _below_ a specified depth. Thus, a column can be identified as masked by evaluating `solid_interface` at the upper grid point, eg `k = grid.Nz`. So, we have a design problem on our hands to figure out how to represent these ideas in the code. We might need more types ;-)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2177#issuecomment-1021328044:1530,mask,masked,1530,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2177#issuecomment-1021328044,8,['mask'],"['masked', 'masking']"

This is clearer, and will give you the correct value even if you change the grid in the future. Note that in the call to `zspacing()` above, we need to specify the x, y and z positions to get the spacing, but in a `RectilinearGrid` Δz is constant in x and y so those arguments don't really matter. Also note that the code above is written for the most recent Oceananigans version (for which you'll need Julia 1.9). 3. Now to your main point (sorry for the tangents! :grimacing:), I don't see anything obviously wrong with the code. Just from looking at it, it looks like it _should_ work. (Btw, when I say that, I assume this is a _only snippet, and not the full-code_, since I get errors when I try to run your code (`coriolis`, `T_bcs` and `S_bcs` aren't defined, `Fx` looks like it'd cause an error, etc.), so I haven't been able to properly run and test your snippet.). That said, there are things I personally would try:; - Have you tried better resolving the model? A 64^3 model _should_ be able to achieve a log-law, but it's still worth investigating.; - Have you tried using the `SmagorinskyLilly` closure? I've had some issues with AMD in the past (although not exactly the same as yours), and I remember @glwagner mentioning having an issue with AMD near boundaries that could explain the behavior you're seeing.; - Finally, I'd suggest starting with a very simple model first for debugging/investigating. Just the bare minimum to reproduce a log-law.

Availability,"rpretable and readable. I'm not sure we would achieve the same if we hide such a feature inside the source code. Does @navidcy's suggestion work for you @tomchor ?. I also think it is preferred to use separate files for a situation like this (though it may not be necessary to save intermediate times in the spin-up at all --- so a second file might not be necessary). If the spin up is recorded, I think it's better to use a separate file for its data. If the spin up is expensive, the following performance optimization could be used (we can leverage the `velocities` kwarg to save a bit of allocation):. ```julia; # Spin up with no tracers; model = NonhydrostaticModel(; tracers=nothing, kwargs...); simulation = Simulation(model, ...) # etc; run!(simulation). # Run for real, re-using the old `velocities` fields but overwriting the old `model`; model = NonhydrostaticModel(; tracers=:c, velocities=model.velocities, kwargs...); simulation = Simulation(model, ...) # etc; ```. There is some additional memory allocation for tendencies in this case, however, so it may not work for simulations that push GPU memory. > (I'm not aware of any way to ""remove"" the old Simulation from the GPU memory, but if there is, then this downside can be negated.). This occurs automatically with garbage collection, provided that there's no reference to the old simulation in the name space. CUDA may have a way to manually call the garbage collector, after doing something like `model=nothing; simulation=nothing`. If you figure that out, it'd be nice to know. > It makes for more complex code, especially when figuring out when it's safe to pick-up a simulation or not, due to the way pick-ups work. I don't follow, but if there's something to improve about picking simulations up we should pursue that.

Availability,"rt(3)=1.7 --- just barely achieving the ""3x"" needed for RK3 to be superior. But that's just in theory. In practice we find that solutions become unstable at lower CFL, and caution warrants a bit of buffer. It seems like we usually use CFL=0.1-0.2 for AB2 but CFL=0.5-1 for RK3. So at the lower end for AB2, RK3 is indeed providing a decent speed up for time to solution. And I agree with you @ali-ramadhan that I have found in practice that I prefer RK3 for LES. There is more to the story --- RK3 also has superior stability properties for diffusion. Where there is some interesting room for further research is also to understand how much more stable RK3 might make a turbulence closure scheme like CATKE or k-epsilon. We do find that these can impose stricter time-step restrictions than advection, especially on grids with very fine vertical resolution near the surface. RK3 also has the crucial advantage that it is self-starting. This means we can change the time-step at will (without resolving this issue I guess) and we don't need tendencies to checkpoint. Also of course RK3 is actually 3rd order whereas QAB2 is first order. Note that the advantages of RK3 have historically not been useful for ocean simulations because at coarse (non-eddy-resolving) resolutions the momentum time-step is limited by Coriolis, not by CFL / advection. In that case a one-stage time-stepper might be preferred. > Out of curiousity, how much work is it to implement RK3 for HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel?. It may be a research project to adapt the split-explicit free surface. It's little unclear because naively, we may be able to advance the split-explicit free surface each stage and therefore use the same algorithm we use for AB2.

Availability,"s an alias for ifelse?. No, the ternary operator `a ? b : c` is shorthand for . ```julia; if a; b; else; c; end; ```. This `if`-statement (as well as the logicals `&&` and `||`) are _short-circuiting_. That is, `c` is guaranteed _not_ to run if `a === true`.

The first call to `f(a, true)` executes without problems, because the second _branch_ isn't executed at all.

Availability,"small `Δt` even in this MWE. But now I realize that because of the status of the immersed Poisson solver, the velocity along the boundary is divergent, strongly so. So, `div(u')` is large along the boundary. And when we divide by `Δt` we get something huge. The magnitude of `div(u')` also somehow seems to depend on the time step (as does the magnitude of the spurious circulation). The correct solution to this case remains at rest of course. (An aside is that this problem _could_ be avoided by separately computing the hydrostatic pressure, and then using a special horizontal gradient operators that avoid computing a hydrostatic pressure gradient across an immersed boundary. However, this would only be correct for no-flux boundary conditions on buoyancy on side walls). Anyways, apparently because of this issue with the immersed pressure solver, it seems that `div(u')` is large (because `div(u)` is large) even when `Δt = O(1e-14)`... - As a result of all of this I am confused about whether this MWE is actually reliable for debugging the issue. I guess we should expect to see problems simply when `Δt = O(eps)` because this is when `div(u') / Δt` cannot be reliably computed, I think. This leads to a fairly simple criteria for the time step that's compatible with the pressure correction. But as noted in this PR, this is not enough to fix issues with the immersed boundary MWE... but whether or not that is because of problems with the setup itself, I'm not sure... - All of that said, taking @tomchor suggestion to be more careful in updating the clock for RK3 actually does solve the MWE here. Obviously, this is again addressing the (in principle not entirely solvable) issue of error accumulation in `clock.time`, rather than addressing the other issue with very small time-steps producing an ill-posed pressure correction. I think we should fix RK3 separately, basically because we cannot completely avoid accumulating error in `clock.time`, every little thing we do to make it mo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3606#issuecomment-2153020136:1747,reliab,reliable,1747,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3606#issuecomment-2153020136,2,['reliab'],['reliable']

Availability,"spatch?. The main motivation being that we don't have to write extra functions that dispatch on the forcing, thus simplifying the time stepping code. As you point out we don't want to write _5! = 120_ new functions. The `update_source_terms!` function is already 52 lines long so I'd rather avoid having to dispatch on this function. > An argument against macros is that they make the code more obscure. It's harder to figure out what is happening because you have to find the definition of the macro. I think this is context-dependent. The purpose of a macro with a name like `@insert_forcing_u` or `@insert_forcing_term` is pretty clear. If we used dispatch then you'd still have to scroll through multiple function definitions. > Come to think of it, the user can also just define a forcing function that indexes into some constant array. Why is this not a good solution?. I think this would work pretty well. I couldn't figure out how to pass in the array to be indexed so that it can fit in the `Fu(grid, velocities, tracers, i, j, k)` signature and be available for the user to fill. Where in the model should we store the forcing array in this case?. Hmmm, actually we could make the function accept the forcing struct, e.g.; ```julia; Fu(grid, velocities, tracers, forcing, i, j, k); ```; but then we'd have to have arrays in the forcing struct, e.g.; ```julia; struct Forcing{Tu,Tv,Tw,TT,TS,TA<:AbstractArray}; u::Tu; v::Tv; w::Tw; T::TT; S::TS; u_arr::TA; v_arr::TA; w_arr::TA; T_arr::TA; S_arr::TA; end; ```; and then the forcing function is just; ```julia; Fu(grid, velocities, tracers, forcing, i, j, k) = forcing.u_arr[i, j, k]; ```. Either we have 5 array types so fields with an actual forcing function get `nothing` for the array or we have 1 array type `TA` and set the arrays for forcings with a function to something like `Array{Float64}(undef, 0)`. Might be a little too ugly but I think yeah we should be able to accommodate array forcings with the current framework somehow (and",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/110#issuecomment-470548318:1123,avail,available,1123,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/110#issuecomment-470548318,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"und + deviation. If that's not the case then the boundary conditions are set up correctly. I believe the next thing to try is the same set up but without `BackgroundField` and imposing the Neumann boundary conditions associated with the buoyancy frequency. If that behaves correctly, then the problem would appear to be in `BackgroundField`, as you suspect. . **Update:** ; I made the following changes,. - Removed the background field from model,; - Added `N^2 * (z + D)` into the initial conditiosn of the buoyancy,; - Imposed `buoyancy_gradient_bc` at the top and bottom of the domain. Unfortunately, the same problems occur at the boundary. . This does not seem to be imposing the correct boundary conditions on a tracer field at the top and bottom. **Periodic condition:**; I did try setting the vertical direction to periodic and unfortunately that gave an error, copied below. .

Availability,"urwitz wave on the cubed sphere against an established benchmark, I chose the exact solution of the non-linear barotropic vorticity equation on the sphere (not the solution of the non-linear shallow water equations). This was achieved by replacing the initial phase Rλ with the time-dependent phase Rλ−νt in Equations (143)–(146) of [Williamson et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999105800166), using the angular velocity ν given by Equation (142). The results at a resolution of 128x128 cells per panel are as follows:. - Since we prescribe the initial stream function and numerically take its derivatives to specify the initial velocities on the cubed sphere, numerical errors are present even in the initial velocities and the diagnosed initial vorticity. The vorticity error is significantly pronounced near the cubed sphere corners due to the deviation from orthogonality. For instance, in the domain's interior, the vorticity error norm is three orders of magnitude less than the vorticity norm, whereas at the corners, it is nearly the same order of magnitude.; - As the simulation progresses, the amplified error from the corners propagates into the interior as expected. After 500 time steps, the vorticity error in the interior increases from three orders of magnitude less to one order of magnitude less than the vorticity norm. I have attached panel-wise plots of the exact vorticity and the error of its numerical counterpart on the cubed sphere for the initial condition and after 500 time steps for reference. Given these circumstances, @navidcy and I are contemplating whether we should continue using the exact solution for verification in the test script or consider alternative verification methods, such as ensuring that the norm of the numerical solution of the Rossby-Haurwitz wave remains bounded within a specified range (as mentioned in the introduction to this PR). @glwagner, @simone-silvestri and @jm-c, let us know your thoughts. **Exact initi",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3570#issuecomment-2134152684:1010,error,error,1010,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3570#issuecomment-2134152684,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"uspect.; 3. Note: these forms of viscosity are not strictly positive preserving and they can increase kinetic energy. I know of a form of the harmonic case that is positive preserving and we could include that. But does anyone case about those levels of details? If yes I can include the form in the writeup and even a short derivation of how to get it from the 3D equations.; 4. @glwagner pointed out that `ShallowWaterModel` is very separate from everything else in Oceananigans and that is a bit of a pain to maintain. One advantage of a `VectorInvariant` form is that it could rely heavily on `HydrostaticModel`, that way they grow together. It might even ben an embarassingly simply application.; 5. I would like there to be a switch from free-surface to rigid-lid. In the latter we have to solve an elliptic problem, and again probably easier with a `VectorInvariant` form but probably not difficult with a conservative form either. How do people suggest this would work?; 6. I would like to have both `VectorInvariant` and `Conservative` forms. Each has their advantages and if you wanted to know if your results were robust, you could try both and if they give you the same result then you would have confidence in your results. But maybe people would think this is too much effort to maintain?. As for the utility of the shallow water model, I would like to get some students using it in Oceananigans to study oceanographic problems, and if we wanted to include coastlines I think we could do this using the `VectorInvariant` form but not the `Conservative` form. I don't expect this will be of huge demand, but it is also be useful for pedagogical reasons, for students learning about GFD and oceanography. I also think it's a nice way to test advection schemes as with the free-surface version we don't have to solve for the pressure, so it's simpler. I am of course very interested as to what others think about these issues as well.

Availability,"vant PR if there is a long list of PRs within a particular release, only one of which is important. (Note this information can also be obtained via `git blame` on `Project.toml`.). One concern I have is that we struggle to enforce conventions already, like style conventions in source code, branch naming conventions, etc. For example, issues should be labeled --- this issue itself needs a label!. What do we think about working on making PR titles more descriptive and helpful, rather than copying information that I think should be in PRs into release notes? It's nice to encourage people to look at PRs too; we can have conversations there (unlike release notes). As far as breaking changes go, by definition they should be encapsulated in a single PR so I think this will succeed. Another policy change that could help is to require two approving reviews (rather than just one), and to also informally try to be more strict about approving PRs. > Users can have an idea if their code will break with updating, which might prompt them to update more often; (I think in practice lots of users don't update their code regularly since there's a looming possibility of their code to stop running and them having to deal with errors.).

Availability,"y Equation (142). The results at a resolution of 128x128 cells per panel are as follows:. - Since we prescribe the initial stream function and numerically take its derivatives to specify the initial velocities on the cubed sphere, numerical errors are present even in the initial velocities and the diagnosed initial vorticity. The vorticity error is significantly pronounced near the cubed sphere corners due to the deviation from orthogonality. For instance, in the domain's interior, the vorticity error norm is three orders of magnitude less than the vorticity norm, whereas at the corners, it is nearly the same order of magnitude.; - As the simulation progresses, the amplified error from the corners propagates into the interior as expected. After 500 time steps, the vorticity error in the interior increases from three orders of magnitude less to one order of magnitude less than the vorticity norm. I have attached panel-wise plots of the exact vorticity and the error of its numerical counterpart on the cubed sphere for the initial condition and after 500 time steps for reference. Given these circumstances, @navidcy and I are contemplating whether we should continue using the exact solution for verification in the test script or consider alternative verification methods, such as ensuring that the norm of the numerical solution of the Rossby-Haurwitz wave remains bounded within a specified range (as mentioned in the introduction to this PR). @glwagner, @simone-silvestri and @jm-c, let us know your thoughts. **Exact initial vorticity**. ![cubed_sphere_rossby_haurwitz_wave_ζ₀_exact](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/12926768/ec936d28-49e5-4da2-9f49-783e517b6f0c). **Error in initial vorticity**. ![cubed_sphere_rossby_haurwitz_wave_ζ₀_error](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/12926768/59374933-eeab-417b-adfe-56eb1e2e5673). **Exact vorticity after 500 time steps**. ![cubed_sphere_rossby_haurwitz_wave_ζ_exact](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3570#issuecomment-2134152684:1482,error,error,1482,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3570#issuecomment-2134152684,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"y but is simple to implement and requires no significant changes to the model. For fast flows you might need to damp more strongly (and thus decrease the time step) but the solution should converge as you do so. It's not a built-in feature but is pretty easy to implement by adding appropriate forcing functions to an Oceananigans model. For example, in PR #693 we used such a method to simulate viscous flow around a cylinder (in 2D). Here is the simulation script: https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/ar/flow-around-cylinder/verification/flow_around_cylinder/flow_around_cylinder.jl. These are the most relevant lines: https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/a921fc3edbf795bf4a2193cca84cad41ebdd5625/verification/flow_around_cylinder/flow_around_cylinder.jl#L18-L27. In this case the boundary was described analytically and `boundary(x, y, z)` evaluates to `1` inside the cylinder and to `0` outside. In your case maybe it's easier to describe the boundary or missing nodes with a mask or array (also updated snippet for v0.29):; ```julia; # ... Create boundary[i, j, k] array that's 1.0 inside the boundary and 0.0 outside ... K = 50.0 # ""Spring constant"" for immersed boundary method ; parameters = (boundary=boundary, K=K). # Continuous forcing immersed boundary method ; @inline u_immersed_boundary(i, j, k, grid, clock, state, params) =; @inbounds -params.boundary[i, j, k] * params.K * state.velocities.u[i, j, k] ; @inline w_immersed_boundary(i, j, k, grid, clock, state, params) =; @inbounds -params.boundary[i, j, k] * params.K * state.velocities.w[i, j, k] . u_forcing = ParameterizedForcing(u_immersed_boundary, parameters); w_forcing = ParameterizedForcing(w_immersed_boundary, parameters). forcing = ModelForcing(u=u_forcing, w=w_forcing) ; ```. Note that the API has changed a bit since PR #693 so the example is a little out of date.

You can try replacing these lines with something like. ```julia; Random.seed!(1414). T = model.tracers.T; u, v, w = model.velocities. x, y, z = nodes(T, reshape=true); Lz = model.grid.Lz. shape = @. z / Lz * (1 + z / Lz); ΞT = randn(size(T)...) *. shape; Ξu = randn(size(u)...) *. shape; Ξw = randn(size(w)...) *. shape.

Here are a few more tips and best practices for raising issues here:. * Please reduce your code to minimum working examples. The script that was linked contains a lot of extraneous code (including comments copy/pasted from an example) that is irrelevant to the issue we are discussing. Reducing your code to a minimum example is kind to the community and will help people answer your questions faster. * If you can, avoid linking to code and instead paste your code directly into the issue. * Use [github's markdown formatting](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) (such as triple backticks, ""```"") to format code and julia prompt instructions. * Finally, I strongly recommend using environments to manage the Oceananigans version (though I don't think this is intrinsic to the issue, it will help us rule out a lot of possible issues if we can focus on one Oceananigans version). We have written some tips in our wiki: https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/wiki/Productive-Oceananigans-workflows-and-Julia-environments which includes a link to the official Julia documentation. * Sounds like LESbrary.jl needs to be updated!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2766#issuecomment-1267909092:2668,update,updated,2668,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2766#issuecomment-1267909092,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability," can be pretty variable in made more sense for us to take this approach. So the user would specify what they want the two tangential and 1 normal direction to be instead of (u,v,w) specifically. Right, this is what I mean by having an ""abstraction for vectors"" --- awesome! If the momentum equation is treated in vector form then the three components are coupled. User specification is then on the vector momentum equation; users will specify `VelocityBoundaryConditions` (rather than boundary conditions for each component, and `VectorForcing`, rather than forcing on each component. It may also make sense to coalesce the kernels that compute tendencies for each velocity component (but I'm less sure about that). Either way this is a major change to the API at the very least, but probably necessary and something we also need for complex domains for GCM simulations, like the cubed sphere. > the original idea was to infer Flux from Gradient. This makes sense for a continuous immersed boundary where it's not possible to _discretely_ specify fluxes. If we can't discretely specify fluxes, we have to rely on a diffusivity extracted from the specified turbulence closure. This is simple for closures that have isotropic diffusivities, but gets more complicated for closures with anisotropic / tensor diffusivities. Even worse is supporting flux boundary conditions for the case that a closure doesn't use a diffusivity at all... Note also that flux boundary conditions are used almost exclusively except for direct numerical simulation, so this is indeed an important consideration. > I know this is a little different than the fitted version, because it's a little harder to specify a normal direction in that case,. For `GridFittedImmersedBoundary` the normal direction can be easily and efficiently inferred from the masking function by evaluating it at offset `i`, `j`, `k`. If fluid is adjacent to solid in any of those directions, you are on a boundary with a normal in the `x, y, z` direct",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-850559517:1257,continuous,continuous,1257,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-850559517,2,['continuous'],['continuous']

Deployability," describe the PR in words in the top comment, which certainly includes describing a breaking change. It's true that we don't achieve this, however. We could be stricter in PR reviews?. To make it easier to find the specific PRs that has the change which updates the minor version within release notes, we could have a policy to put the new version in the name of the PR, ie preface the PR with. ```; (0.83.0) Title of the PR; ```. That way one can easily find the relevant PR if there is a long list of PRs within a particular release, only one of which is important. (Note this information can also be obtained via `git blame` on `Project.toml`.). One concern I have is that we struggle to enforce conventions already, like style conventions in source code, branch naming conventions, etc. For example, issues should be labeled --- this issue itself needs a label!. What do we think about working on making PR titles more descriptive and helpful, rather than copying information that I think should be in PRs into release notes? It's nice to encourage people to look at PRs too; we can have conversations there (unlike release notes). As far as breaking changes go, by definition they should be encapsulated in a single PR so I think this will succeed. Another policy change that could help is to require two approving reviews (rather than just one), and to also informally try to be more strict about approving PRs. > Users can have an idea if their code will break with updating, which might prompt them to update more often; (I think in practice lots of users don't update their code regularly since there's a looming possibility of their code to stop running and them having to deal with errors.).

Deployability," get this feature is to refactor the output writers to have a more generic interface for splitting. If we have a property called `file_splitting` that _is_ a schedule, then we can write. ```julia; NetCDFOutputWriter(model, outputs; file_splitting = TimeInterval(30days), ...); ```. Then the decision about whether to start a new file will change from. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/9f3f8e6d1469e570b0778f328ab864e879785ffd/src/OutputWriters/jld2_output_writer.jl#L275. to. ```julia; writer.file_splitting(model) && start_next_file(model, writer) ; ```. Next, you will have to add a new schedule in `Utils/schedules.jl` that can split based on filesize:. ```julia; mutable struct FileSizeLargerThan <: AbstractSchedule; max_filesize :: Float64; path :: String; end. (fslt::FileSizeLargerThan)(model) = filesize(fslt.path) >= fslt.max_filesize; ```. Finally, you need to add a user interface for initializing and modifying the schedules to smooth out the user experience (for example, we don't want users to have to specify the file path more than once, and the file path that is checked by the schedule has to be updated). This will have to take two parts. In `Utils/schedules.jl`, a constructor:. ```julia; FileSizeLargerThan(max_filesize) = FileSizeLargerThan(max_filesize, """"); ```. Then in output writers, an interface to be used in both the model constructor and `write_output!`:. ```julia; update_schedule!(schedule, path) = nothing; update_schedule!(schedule::FileSizeLargerThan, path) = schedule.path = path; ```. This function `update_schedule!(writer.schedule, path)` then replaces this line. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/9f3f8e6d1469e570b0778f328ab864e879785ffd/src/OutputWriters/jld2_output_writer.jl#L276. and also needs to be added in the output writer constructor so that. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/9f3f8e6d1469e570b0778f328ab864e879785ffd/src/OutputWriters/jld2_output_writer.jl#L176. becomes. ```julia; filepath = joinpath(dir, fil",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2967#issuecomment-2000029793:1318,update,updated,1318,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2967#issuecomment-2000029793,2,['update'],['updated']

Deployability," if we consider for now just a 1D problem with boundary point $\phi_b$ and interior points at $\phi_{b-1}$ etc. When we go to update the boundary point we have $\phi_b^n$ and $\phi_{b-1}^{n+1}$ and we want $\phi_b^{n+1}$. As per previous work we assume that the bulk speed is the same at both $b$ and $b-1$ but we don't have both the spatial and time derivatives of the $\phi$ interior at the same step so we first need to approximate the previous step as:. $\phi_{b-i}^n = \phi_{b-i}^{n+1}-\Delta t G^n_{b+1}$. We can then find the bulk velocity at timestep n as:. $U_b^n = -\frac{2\Delta x_{b-1}G^n_{b-1}}{\phi^n_b - \phi^{n+1}_{b-2} - \Delta t G^n _{b-2}}$. We then have all the information to step $\phi_b$ to:. $\phi_b^{n+1}=\phi_b^n-\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x_b}U_b(\phi_b^n-\phi_{b-1}^{n+1} - \Delta t G^n_{b-1})$. This will require us to give the boundary condition both the tendencies and $\Delta t$, but this seems to be the easiest thing to change. I also think this is the only way we can get a physically sensible bulk speed where all of the components are calculated at the same timestep. I have also realised that we need to have an exterior value for every open boundary for when the flow spontaneously becomes an inflow so I think it would make sense to have every open boundary be the same and just be `OpenBoundaryCondition(external_value)`, and then put the tendencies etc in as arguments to `_fill_X_halo!`. Then when `U_b` is negative we either set the value or do nudging like in ROMS to prevent shocks (but I think this is a question for further down the line). We might also want to consider oblique waves but that shouldn't be too hard to extend to we might just have to calculate a lot of surrounding points which might motivate some other way to do it. Does this make sense to everyone? I also can't see an obvious way to get $\Delta t$ to the halo fill since it doesn't even make it into the `update_state!` so any suggestions would be appreciated.

Deployability," makes some significant source code changes for what I think is a rather narrow application, which is disproportional compared to most of the other features we have I think. > If for some reason we cannot use a forcing function approach, we'll have to think carefully about how to design a flexible user API for ""particle-induced tracer forcing"". I think if we are going to add this then it should be more general than just a source/sink calculation --- ie, we should attempt to have a small source code addition that makes a wide range of new behavior possible, if we can. I've reconsidered this now and think we may not even need any source code change to properly implement this behaviour and integrate some particle induced tracer forcing. If we have a model with some tracers `(:A, :B)` which we want to force with some particles, we can define an auxiliary field `G\_p=TracerFields((:A, :B), grid)`. We can then have a particle dynamics function that modifies `model.auxiliary_fields.G\_p`, for example sets the points surrounding the particles to `-A[i, j, k]` for `A`, and `+A[i, j, k]` for `B` like in my example above. You can then define a discrete forcing function for each of the tracers like `a_forcing(i, j, k, grid, clock, model_fields) = model_fields.G\_p.A[i, j, k]` etc. (this would only work with my other PR #2733 added so that the `auxiliary_fields` are available). > It seems the memory requirement of the forcing function approach is proportional to the number of tracers, not the number of particles --- right? We would nee an ""auxiliary tendency"" for every tracer; the memory requirement doesn't change based on the number of particles. My reservation with this was that if there's e.g. 1 particle effecting loads of tracers you have to store lots more fields, but I see now that this is much less of an issue. Sorry about making this much more complicated than it should have been!.

Deployability," practice this is really just a performance optimization rather than a physical model (the horizontal drag has no effect on the solution), but it's probably important that we can support it. This low-level, but fully general interface allow advanced users to specify any kind of immersed flux / boundary condition they need to. The next challenge is to design a convenient API that interprets user-input and builds `ImmersedBoundaryCondition` appropriately under the hood. For constant `ValueBoundaryCondition` (eg no-slip) or constant `FluxBoundaryCondition`, this is simple --- just copy the boundary condition into every direction. For `FluxBoundaryCondition` we orient the flux along the inward normal (eg positive for `west, south, bottom` and negative for `east, north, top`. This breaks existing convention for fluxes... but we really don't have a choice. We may want to change the convention for the _other_ boundaries eventually. `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` is perhaps the most important case since we'll use this to implement drag boundary conditions. For this I believe we can use the existing infrastructure for `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` (eg we have a way to properly interpolate fields in a manner consistent with the application of drag boundary conditions, etc). It's functionality will have to be extended to accept functions of `i, j, k` (the way it works now is that the ""third"" index (normal to the boundary) is stored inside the object; for immersed boundary conditions we don't need that). `DiscreteBoundaryFunction` won't be very convenient for most people for immersed boundary conditions, but we can treat it the same way we treat constant `Value` or `Flux`. I wasn't planning to implement support for `Gradient` just yet, though this can be done too. Finally, one remaining task is to define or generalize the existing `conditional_flux` so that it adds fluxes only on _immersed_ boundaries. It looks like right now it's too eager and will add fluxes on non-immersed boun",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2437#issuecomment-1100563991:1440,Continuous,ContinuousBoundaryFunction,1440,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2437#issuecomment-1100563991,1,['Continuous'],['ContinuousBoundaryFunction']

Deployability," we can support it. This low-level, but fully general interface allow advanced users to specify any kind of immersed flux / boundary condition they need to. The next challenge is to design a convenient API that interprets user-input and builds `ImmersedBoundaryCondition` appropriately under the hood. For constant `ValueBoundaryCondition` (eg no-slip) or constant `FluxBoundaryCondition`, this is simple --- just copy the boundary condition into every direction. For `FluxBoundaryCondition` we orient the flux along the inward normal (eg positive for `west, south, bottom` and negative for `east, north, top`. This breaks existing convention for fluxes... but we really don't have a choice. We may want to change the convention for the _other_ boundaries eventually. `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` is perhaps the most important case since we'll use this to implement drag boundary conditions. For this I believe we can use the existing infrastructure for `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` (eg we have a way to properly interpolate fields in a manner consistent with the application of drag boundary conditions, etc). It's functionality will have to be extended to accept functions of `i, j, k` (the way it works now is that the ""third"" index (normal to the boundary) is stored inside the object; for immersed boundary conditions we don't need that). `DiscreteBoundaryFunction` won't be very convenient for most people for immersed boundary conditions, but we can treat it the same way we treat constant `Value` or `Flux`. I wasn't planning to implement support for `Gradient` just yet, though this can be done too. Finally, one remaining task is to define or generalize the existing `conditional_flux` so that it adds fluxes only on _immersed_ boundaries. It looks like right now it's too eager and will add fluxes on non-immersed boundaries. Associated with this development I'd like to refactor our naming scheme for the boolean tools we have. Right now these are `solid_node` and `solid_interface`.

Deployability,"""slow moving"" and carefully curated --- like a textbook --- while using GitHub discussions to encapsulate ""living"", transient, and often more fine-grained knowledge about usage, experimental / rapidly changing features, and generally things that might require extended discussion and benefit from clarification questions. In part this means mostly avoiding tagging issues and pull requests in the documentation. The motivation for this approach has a few parts. First is to clarify ""what belongs in the docs"" versus what kinds of things will be documented elsewhere on the vast internet, so that people know where to look to get the answers they need. The second reason is to help control the development of docs by the community. As the code grows, the docs will have to necessarily grow to become very long. The docs are much shorter than they should be right now because the hydrostatic model in particular is still somewhat ""experimental"" (it's a multi-year effort to develop a fully functional GCM, and we are in the thick of it now). There will be so much more in the docs in the end --- a dozen or more parameterizations for ocean turbulence, sea ice, biogeochemistry, and on and on. As a result, it's going to become very important that the docs are as concise as possible (eg, the same constraint we face when writing a textbook). Thus in this process we'll have to carefully curate whatever goes into the docs as a community, and I think it will be helpful if the docs are only used for ""big"" things. A third reason is just that I think this is will reduce the effort required to maintain docs. For example, this change to the docs will become incorrect when we merge the multi-region PR (which hopefully will be soon). That means that we need to update the docs when we merge that PR. Maybe we will remember this time, but in general I think this approach doesn't scale, and also does something highly undesirable by placing barriers in the way of development.

Deployability,"# Progress update. I decided to take a stab at the simplest case: triply-periodic on the CPU. Surprisingly I was able to get a distributed `IncompressibleModel` running just using multiple dispatch without having to modify any existing code, although a cleaner design might require a bit of refactoring. PR is still a work-in-progress so it's a bit messy, the purpose was to demonstrate a proof of concept. MPI.jl and PencilFFTs.jl are new dependencies but I haven't updated the Project.toml yet. So far this PR adds some new infrastructure:; 1. Distributed/multi-architectures (e.g. `MultiCPU`) that know about rank connectivity.; 2. Halo communication between ranks is done via multiple dispatch on a new `HaloCommunicationBC` type.; 3. A `DistributedFFTBasedPoissonSolver` for solving Poisson equations across ranks.; 4. A `DistributedModel` that creates local grids for each ranks, injects halo communication BCs, and passes the distributed pressure solver to a local `IncompressibleModel`. I also added some simple tests for multi architecture rank connectivity, local grid construction, injection of halo communication BCs, and halo communication (testing x, y, and z slab decompositions). Also added tests for the distributed Poisson solver ensuring the solution is divergence-free. Next step for testing would probably be to test that the code handles `Bounded` topologies correctly then add tests that reproduce the regression tests but on multiple ranks and ensure the output matches the regression output. ## Some notes. ### Domain decomposition. Domain decomposition is supported and tested in x, y, and z. But for `IncompressibleModel` z-decomposition won't work right now because vertical integrals are done inside GPU kernels (so we probably don't want to decompose in z). And PencilFFTs.jl supports decompositions in dimensions 2 and 3 (since dimension 1 FFTs are the fastest). As a result, right now Oceananigans.jl only supports slab decompositions in y although we should figure out",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/590#issuecomment-775301066:11,update,update,11,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/590#issuecomment-775301066,2,['update'],"['update', 'updated']"

Deployability,"**Final Commit Details**. Remove 4/3 factor, && --> &, ζ=NaN where undefined. 1. Remove 4/3 Factor in Vorticity Computation: The 4/3 factor was initially introduced in the vorticity calculation at the corners because the area used to divide the circulation (in the denominator) was reduced to three-quarters of its original value. However, it turns out that by adopting the Haversine formula for calculating the quadrilateral area on a sphere---which simplifies to a triangle when two points coincide---the 4/3 factor is inherently accounted for. Therefore, the explicit inclusion of this factor is no longer necessary. 2. Replace Short-Circuiting && with Logical &: Changed the short-circuiting && operator to the logical & operator to ensure compatibility with GPU operations. 3. Set Circulation Γ and Vorticity ζ to NaN when Undefined: Updated the code to assign NaN (Not a Number) to circulation Γ and vorticity ζ in cases where they are undefined. @glwagner, @navidcy, could one of you please review this PR once the tests pass, so I can proceed with merging?

So whatever's happening probably has to do with the HydrostaticModel, which I'm really not familiar with unfortunately.

Deployability,"1 which forms a regular grid then interpolate in between and back to the sphere to get the other staggered grid coordinates. The file should provide this. > 5. We need to use the sine and cosine of the local angle between the grid orientation (e.g., u-velocity) and zonal west-east direction at the grid-cell centers to `set!` velocity fields. Right now we're limited to setting velocity fields from a streamfunction... Let's come up with an abstraction for vectors and use this for `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. > 6. Should we be filling the halos of the grid metrics? Seems like they should be filled like velocity halos but without any sign changes. Yes. > 7. Make sure that calling `fill_halo_regions!` on a horizontal velocity field only fills the halos with non-`CubedSphereExchange` boundary conditions. Seems easy, but setting boundary conditions will require an abstraction for vectors and coordinate system transformations. > 8. Add the cubed sphere passive tracer advection and surface gravity waves validation experiments to validation CI pipeline. Not urgent. > 9. Figure out a way to abstract and clean up `fill_horizontal_velocity_halos!` and `fill_*_halo!`... Let's come up with an abstraction for vectors and use this for `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. We want to write `fill_halo_regions!(::HorizontalVectorField, ...)`. > 10. Merge utils from `src/CubedSpheres/cubed_sphere_utils.jl` and `src/Distributed/distributed_utils.jl` into `Oceananigans.Grids`. No rush... > 11. Figure out if the tests in `test_cubed_sphere_halo_exchange.jl` can be abstracted and run for all six faces. It's tedious to have to type them out but could be clearer and easier to debug in its current form... I don't think less abstraction is more clear. > 12. Fix tests!. Tests must pass or we can't develop. > 13. I think cubed sphere performance can be improved, especially for halo filling.

Deployability,"2e807a80-d36d-11eb-924a-074ca0ad127c.png). ### Tracer Conservation; We can also look at tracer conservation. The initial concentration is sinusoidal, so the area integrated concentration is zero over the domain initially. I've plotted both the IBM and non-IBM (lighter colors) results to see the differences. This one is on a log plot. You can see that leakage is happening in the IBM versions. It's hard to say how bad the leakage is here, and it'll probably be better to consider an initial constant concentration rather than sinusoidal to see how much leakage is occurring due to the immersed solid. ![volint_Concentration_log](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67593861/122986580-a058c400-d36d-11eb-9a7c-e3e8d2a7367e.png). It might be easier to see what is going on in the IBM cases without the log scaling:. ![volint_Concentration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67593861/122989251-984e5380-d370-11eb-88cc-ccf4444fb331.png). ### Integrated Boundary Stress; Finally, I looked at the integrated boundary stress along the top wall. The error between the nonIBM and IBM versions at these same grid sizes are below. Unfortunately this is not getting better with increased resolution. This could be due to base state changes causing the stress to change and not necessarily something wrong with the method. It might take better refinement than 256 x 256 to really see a trend here. ![Bickley_dudy_diff](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67593861/122987679-dc405900-d36e-11eb-895a-0f66daf9a473.png). Any thought on these results would be greatly appreciated, or if there is something else that might be good to look at with this particular test case. Further refinements to the grid are taking quite a long time to run on my PC, but they can be done. These were run with a viscosity of 0 for the isotropic closure. I want to look at the viscous cases of these to see if the results change at all with added viscosity. I'm also working on some cylinder validation metrics for ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1733#issuecomment-866285588:1544,Integrat,Integrated,1544,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1733#issuecomment-866285588,2,"['Integrat', 'integrat']","['Integrated', 'integrated']"

Deployability,"> * I removed the `BackgroundField` v-velocity, which had no effect on the solution because the domain is `Flat` in y. The only effect of the background flow is through the bottom drag boundary condition. The docs preview hasn't updated yet, so I can't see the video, but I suspect removing `v` as a background creates oscillations. @glwagner have you checked? If not, let's wait for the video to see what happens... > * I reduced the domain aspect ratio to 400 x 100 because based on the visualization it seemed the domain didn't need to be so wide. This lets us increase the resolution and reduce the diffusivity, which is neat. It's a bit more turbulent now. Good move :+1: . > * Note using a tuple for `ĝ` rather than `Array` means it can be used as a parameter on the GPU, so that's probably preferred.

The purpose of creating a new environment is to carefully control the package versions that are used when you compile and run Oceananigans code. This is good practice regardless of whether bugs like this exist, because you can ensure that you always run the same code with the same release version of Oceananigans. You should update packages in your environment _carefully and deliberately_ --- because updating packages can (and certainly will, given you are working for enough time) break your scripts.

For example, the perturbation vorticity in the current definition may not be initially zero, even if there were no noise. If the ""mean vorticity"" were calculated discretely, then the perturbation vorticity would be identically zero initially. A similar concept holds for geostrophic balance. There is a discrete geostrophic balance condition contains in a model that's stratified and rotating. This discrete condition is close to, but not exactly identical to the continuous geostrophic balance condition.

If we try using whatever closure here that is used in the hydrostatic model, I would think that it should yield a similar result. But that's maybe better saved for a future PR?. Let me clarify. We've never run the hydrostatic model with a single layer on the sphere, but this is a good idea. Most of our runs have been with 50 vertical levels. In the 3D configuration with 50 vertical levels, we smooth results with 1) WENO5 vector invariant advection and 2) biharmonic ""divergence damping"" of the divergence component of the flow. If we are going to compare the shallow water on a sphere to they hydrostatic model, we will have to produce additional runs with just 1 vertical level. In other words, there are no results to compare with right now. When we perform additional runs, we may choose to include divergence damping, or another kind of closure, if we want to. The results presented in #2317 also use a single layer hydrostatic model, and these did not require any explicit dissipation. Therefore, there is reason to believe that divergence damping is only required for 3D simulations. An additional point is that in the shallow water equations we can introduce a WENO reconstruction of the mass flux. This reconstruction may provide divergence damping (whether or not we need it!). In summary, if we would like to perform a comparison, we can choose to either 1) produce a comparison between the shallow water model and one layer hydrostatic model with no explicit closure on the sphere or 2) run new 1 layer hydrostatic simulations with some closure (of our choosing) and then _also_ implement that closure in the shallow water model.

Do you know what the time-step is when this happens?I'm wondering if it has to do with using a very small time-step, leading to a round-off error issue. That would also explain why it doesn't affect dynamics, because huge pressure gradient integrated over a machine epsilon duration may not have an impact.; > ; > Are you referring to the fact that sometimes `model` has to use a very tiny time-step to bridge the gap between the current time and the output time? If so, that's an interesting possibility that I hadn't considered. Although in the example above I'm fixing the time-step at `25`, while the output time interval is `200`, so I wouldn't expect any issues there. Can you check just to be sure? Because having an output interval that's some multiple of the time step is exactly when we expect to see miniscule time-steps due to round off error. The pressure source term is the divergence of the predictor velocity divided by time-step. As the time-step vanishes, the divergence of the predictor velocity also vanishes (because the flow has not evolved from its previous, non-divergent solution). We get a situation tending to 0/0. I think there's a few things we could do to solve this. First of all if we take a very small time-step, I think we can actually just re-set the model time rather than taking a time-step. Second I am wondering if we want to implement a time type that has finite resolution (ie there is a smallest time increment one can take). For example, datetimes have a smallest unit (micro or nanoseconds). A non-dimensional or dimensional-agnostic time type could also be designed analogously (eg every time is the multiple of an integer by the fundamental unit). This would eliminate round off error but it's a bit of work and also we have to put some thought into how best to accomplish it.

Deployability,"> > I'm strongly opposed to having multiple small packages.; >; > Why is that, given the benefits?. Mainly I think we can get all the same benefits by maintaining a single unified and tidy repository with sub-modules. I don't see Oceananigans as a complex project yet, we're barely at 2,500 lines of code (minus turbulence closure operators which aren't integrated yet). I can see reasons for having a separate repository for examples and tutorials if there are enough of them, but I don't see e.g. the output writers as being logically separate from the main code. As a stand alone package, OceananigansOutput.jl doesn't do anything useful. Something like TurbulenceClosures.jl could though. Keeping things in tidy submodules within a single repository increases code visibility, which I think is important. When I see a package or framework spread across multiply small packages I find it hard to get an idea about what it can do. Another nice thing is we currently have ""unified versioning"" so when releases occur we know everything works together. We don't have to worry about running with Oceananigans v0.x with OceananigansPlotting v0.y and OceananigansOutput#master to fix some issue. From a development perspective, issues and pull requests are now spread across multiple repositories and we can end up with pull requests that depend on other pull requests in other repositories, e.g. when adding in halo regions the main code got refactored but so did the output writers and plotting code would change as well. We can also end up with multiple test suites that need to pass, plus possibly multiple CI pipelines to manage. So right now it's easy to make atomic changes that touch upon multiple pieces of code (and we'll probably be in this stage where we need to refactor frequently for a while).

It's just that subtle bugs can creep into packages that might cause things to fail for us (for example something subtle can break type inference, causing everything to fail on the GPU).

Just to clarify, the quoted example suggests integrating `b` to find `psi`. If `u` is a function of `y` only I think we can integrate the relation `dy(psi) = u` to find `psi`. If the geostrophic streamfunction is a function of `x, y` then I think solving an elliptic problem is required, probably?. To summarize:. * To obtain `psi(x, y, z)` from `b(x, y, z)`, we integrate the relation `b = f * dz(psi)`. `IntegratedField` is useful.; * To obtain `psi(x, y, z)` from from `u(x, y, z)`, `v(x, y, z)` I _think_ (might be worth thinking about this more) we solve the horizontal elliptic problem `hlap(psi) = dx(v) - dy(u)` at every vertical level.; * To obtain a 2D `psi(y, z)` (for example), we might be able to integrate `dy(psi) = u`. These techniques could be important when initializing from data, perhaps. I'm not sure. For example, if a 3D distribution of `T, S` were obtained from data without knowledge of the velocity field, it might make sense to initialize the problem with a geostrophic velocity field. It'd be great to have utilities for all of these cases eventually. For idealized work I think its better to specify the streamfunction `psi`.

Can you point to them for us? Have you considered expanding to ""online"" capabilities? What are the pros and cons of that?. The two models we currently have some support for (offline) are `MITgcm` and `oceananigans.jl`. . I have examples for both models in <https://gaelforget.github.io/ClimateModels.jl/dev/examples/> which you can run the JuliaClimate sandbox <https://juliaclimate.github.io/Notebooks/> and generate the kind of model output that `PlanktonIndividuals.jl` or `IndividualDisplacement.jl` can then ingest as input for offline computation. The `PlanktonIndividuals.jl` documentation has corresponding examples on the ecology + bgc side. An online mode with models like `MITgcm` and `oceananigans.jl` would be useful in my view, in the case of both `PlanktonIndividuals.jl` or `IndividualDisplacement.jl`. With this being said, I tend to most like the idea of small'ish modeling components developed outside of monolitic modeling efforts that emphasize code re-usability and integration with multiple models. .

I now we can do better, and maybe this is a way of doing that. One key problem to solve is that we cannot pass non-contiguous data between GPUs without scalar operations. This affects both ""direct"" communication via the CUDA.jl API and cuda-aware MPI. As a result passing non-continuous data is _extremely_ slow and is probably the primary reason for the abysmal multi-GPU scaling we saw.

Reading over the features there makes me realize that we probably want to ""align"" the time-step (somehow, similar to the root finding feature that's provided for DiffEq) for callbacks. We align time-steps for output, but not for callbacks (yet). That would be nice to add. I think we could also add an analog of the ""continuous callback"" --- to the models, not the simulations --- that's executed during `update_state!`, and therefore can be thought of as a function that ""continuously"" (eg valid at every moment in time) modifies the state of the model.

For the moment those two elements are part of this PR.; > ; > This PR follows the (simple) configuration of the 2decomp library https://github.com/2decomp-fft/2decomp-fft, the difference between PencilFFT/PencilArray and this PR (a part bounded domain ffts) is that here (at the moment) we impose the stricter limitation that `Ny` has to be divisible by `Rx` and `Ry` while `Nz` has to be divisible by `Ry`, where `Rx` and `Ry` are the number of ranks (divisions) in the x and y direction. Relaxing the requirements should not be too difficult. Nice, thanks for that explanation. Why are we following 2decomp? PencilArrays has some benchmarking that shows it can compete with the fastest codes out there. I don't see anything similar for 2decomp, so I can't figure out what the motivation for following that strategy would be. I'm not sure if they are different, either. Something we do not previously support (but which is implemented in https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2538) was an algorithm that could support any topology with vertically-stretched grids. What is the relationship between this PR and https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2538, and does this PR support vertically stretched grids?. One of the main limitations of PencilArrays from our perspective is that it could not distribute an array along the first dimension. Since we almost always would like to use vertically stretched grids (and for various reasons, we may want to also compute the hydrostatic pressure with a vertical integral), ocean LES are typically distributed in x and y.

The main issue is that the dynamics can be ""correct"" but the test can fail. I feel its a bad test for this reason. I don't have much to add to the discussion. I agree with you that a balanced state in a continuous system doesn't necessarily translate exactly to a discrete one. When I (or Ali?) came up with this test I figured this translation error would be small enough to be acceptable, and when the test actually passed I was happy enough with that. So if this translation error is indeed large enough with the new solver that the tests don't pass I'm very much okay with changing the test. I can't, for the moment, think of another simple test to replace it though.

I see you used `GradientBoundaryCondition(0)` in your validation codes but, for example, for buoyancy that's not gonna cut it and will lead to reflections. The majority of the new code here deals with the fact that you can't update the boundary condition on wall normal velocities after the pressure correction step and maintain the interior domain to be physical and divergence-free, so we have a new function `_fill_X_open_halo!`, but there is nothing stopping you from also defining new methods for `_fill_west_halo!` which still acts before both the predictor and correct step and is what you would need to write for centre field OBCs. The reason I used `GradientBoundaryCondition(0)` in the validation case is that the literature suggests that it doesn't make much of a difference for the non-wall normal velocity component what boundary condition you use (e.g. https://doi.org/10.1002/fld.1650181006 ""(iii)&plat + Vacp/dn = 0, where V is ‘user-specified’, but cannot be zero, and should be positive if fluid is leaving the domain.

It might be helpful to add this kind of forcing more similar to the first interface and ask users to define slip velocity functions with arbitrary arguments e.g. `w(x, y, z, t, $\rho$, d)`, and then we make the inside of the lagrangian particle advection kernel pass the correct particle properties to the function.

Deployability,"> Can you please restate this? I think a code example would be helpful with an explanation on what's being accomplished. Also can you explain why this can't be implemented with a Callback (or forcing function)? I.e., why do we desire this as a source code feature? Just to be clear, I'm not saying it should be one way or another, but it's good to have explicit justification for source code features (which are expensive to maintain and require resources to test)!. No problem at all, [heres](https://gist.github.com/jagoosw/213d7f2ce3707768d4ddb07f8827cdd2) an example (not sure where best to put this/if you'd want it in the examples folder). This is about the simplest version I could think of where we have a particle randomly walking around converting tracer a into tracer b. The specific use case we've been using this for is modelling kelp fronds as particles which grow (variety of particle properties change) depending on how much nutrients the particles uptake from a biogeochemical model, and also release tracer back into the model. I also envisage using this to exert drag on the flow at some point. ![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26657828/188803448-86bc2fe2-dbbc-447a-93c6-ff238f6dde06.gif). Although I've had this working as custom dynamics of the particles the effect of the particles tendency can only be integrated with explicit Euler, i.e. at each substep it just does `tracer[i, j, k] += value*Δt`, where as this solution allows it to be properly integrated along with the other tendencies. I couldn't think of a way to implement this as a forcing function before, but perhaps I could use a callback to update an auxiliary field with the tendencies of the particles, and then add this as a forcing function, although I imagine that could use a lot more memory if there were a large grid and small amount of particles.

Deployability,"> Greg, Doesn't Ali have a version of immersed boundary layers going?. @johncmarshall54, Ali experimented with a simple immersed boundary implemented via Oceananigans's user-defined forcing functions. The code is these 9 lines:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/a921fc3edbf795bf4a2193cca84cad41ebdd5625/verification/flow_around_cylinder/flow_around_cylinder.jl#L18-L27. This implementation damps the velocity field to zero on a very fast time-scale (specified by the parameter `K`) within the immersed boundary. This is certainly a nice, simple immersed boundary implementation for Dirichlet / Value boundary conditions and could be a good starting point. However, I also think there's some good reasons to pursue an alternate immersed boundary implementation to what @ali-ramadhan has done:. 1. @ali-ramadhan's implementation doesn't obviously extend to other boundary conditions, like prescribed gradients or fluxes (the latter being crucial for the geophysical problems we're interested in). So, even if we use a continuous forcing method similar to @ali-ramadhan's implementation, we need to figure out how to enforce boundary conditions other than Dirichlet boundary conditions.; 2. @ali-ramadhan's implementation conforms exactly to the grid; however we would like to be able to model smoothly-varying boundaries.; 3. As noted by @whitleyv, @ali-ramadhan's ""continuous forcing method"" implementation introduces a time-step restriction due to the need to explicitly resolve the damping time-scale in the forcing function. It seems that a discrete forcing method overcomes this restriction and could prove crucial for geophysical problems that involve otherwise long time-steps.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1036#issuecomment-707412244:1029,continuous,continuous,1029,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1036#issuecomment-707412244,2,['continuous'],['continuous']

Then when `U_b` is negative we either set the value or do nudging like in ROMS to prevent shocks (but I think this is a question for further down the line).

To clarify, the statement ""when U_b is negative"" means more generally ""when U_b implies inflow into the domain"". It makes sense to me that inflow is prescribed, whereas outflow is a little tricker, requiring us to smoothly advect information out of the domain. Having the boundary condition depend on the previous time-step does seem to break assumptions we have made about how information flows. For example, we call `update_state!` during model construction. How does the first time-step / initialization work with this kind of outflow model? It might help to consider that. Practically speaking it would not be hard to pass the time-step to update state.

Deployability,"> I think it would be good to have the Stokes drift profile available somewhere. So even though only the Stokes shear is used in Oceananigans, I think it is still useful to get the Stokes drift at every level and then differentiate that to get the Stokes shear. I agree! Just to makes sure we're on the same page, it seems we need two separate functions to calculate both the Stokes velocity and Stokes shear averaged over a finite volume cell:. 1. The finite-volume-averaged Stokes _shear_ is the difference between a continuous expression for the Stokes velocity evaluated at the top and bottom of a cell; 2. The finite-volume-averaged Stokes velocity is the difference between a continuous expression for the total-depth-averaged Stokes velocity at the top and bottom of a cell. > In terms of implementation the ""theory wave"" is easier -- it's essentially a function of wind speed (the integration over the empirical wave spectrum is done analytically). We just need to apply it multiple time to different depths and then differentiate that to get the layer averaged Stokes drift.

Deployability,"> I'm still wondering about this solution, which may both be _more general_ (since users can effect arbitrary changes to tracer tendencies, not just source/sink terms) and is less heavy in the source code. Right now, this PR makes some significant source code changes for what I think is a rather narrow application, which is disproportional compared to most of the other features we have I think. > If for some reason we cannot use a forcing function approach, we'll have to think carefully about how to design a flexible user API for ""particle-induced tracer forcing"". I think if we are going to add this then it should be more general than just a source/sink calculation --- ie, we should attempt to have a small source code addition that makes a wide range of new behavior possible, if we can. I've reconsidered this now and think we may not even need any source code change to properly implement this behaviour and integrate some particle induced tracer forcing. If we have a model with some tracers `(:A, :B)` which we want to force with some particles, we can define an auxiliary field `G\_p=TracerFields((:A, :B), grid)`. We can then have a particle dynamics function that modifies `model.auxiliary_fields.G\_p`, for example sets the points surrounding the particles to `-A[i, j, k]` for `A`, and `+A[i, j, k]` for `B` like in my example above. You can then define a discrete forcing function for each of the tracers like `a_forcing(i, j, k, grid, clock, model_fields) = model_fields.G\_p.A[i, j, k]` etc. (this would only work with my other PR #2733 added so that the `auxiliary_fields` are available). > It seems the memory requirement of the forcing function approach is proportional to the number of tracers, not the number of particles --- right?

Deployability,"> Interesting, thanks for those details! That's odd that there are changes in memory allocation associated with building diagnostics. I don't think there's been changes to `Field` between 0.77.5 and 0.78.0. @navidcy might be able to say more. I think 0.78.0 only upgraded the tests to julia 1.8?; ; Maybe this indicates that the changes are due to changes in the dependencies when upgrading to 1.8?. > I'm also curious why the diagnostics consume so much memory. Are you producing a lot of 3D time averages (which can't be constructed in post-processing?) We've attempted to design the code so that reductions can be performed with minimal memory allocation. 3D diagnostics can simply be calculated from snapshots of the model state, so there's no need to allocate memory (assuming that static memory greatly exceeds GPU memory, this would be preferred). Are we missing a feature to help reduce memory requirements of diagnostics perhaps?. That's interesting. I'm actually also performing a significant amount of 3D averages, as you picked up on. The reason for that is because I want them at a higher frequency than the 3D snapshots that I'm outputting. I'd need a lot of disk-space to output the 3D fields at such high frequencies, so it's a storage limitation issue. That said, I wasn't aware that 3D averages in particular were memory-intensive, so I might rethink that rationale.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2794#issuecomment-1300682800:263,upgrade,upgraded,263,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2794#issuecomment-1300682800,2,['upgrade'],['upgraded']

Deployability,"> Its ok for there to be a divergence in the slip velocity. In the case of the ocean surface or seafloor that's exactly what you want since the particles will then accumulate at those surfaces depending on whether they are light or dense. Tracer is conserved in an integrated sense since the flux through the boundary vanishes. In some cases the user might want a flux across the boundary, e.g. for dense particles sinking through an open boundary at the bottom of the domain, so we probably want the profile of the slip velocity in the user's control. Also, note that for very buoyant tracers there will be numerical issues if the tracer all accumulates at the surface. Finer grid spacing can help a bit, but I think this is a drawback to using buoyant tracers and particles work better in those cases (Jenny discusses this in her draft paper on microplastics which is under review). That makes physical sense!. I believe supporting divergent slip velocities means we cannot use the ""flux form"" of the advection term, ie we cannot rewrite. ```; u_slip ⋅ ∇c = ∇ ⋅ (u_slip c); ```. correct? This means that we cannot use native Oceananigans operators for this advection term, since the operators we've implemented all assume that the advecting velocity field is non-divergent. This is not much of an issue since we can easily write a second-order discretization of `u_slip ⋅ ∇c`. In addition, we can support a flag in which users might optionally declare the velocity field as non-divergent, in which case we can use higher-order discretizations of `∇ ⋅ (u_slip c)`.

So the background buoyancy shouldn't be introducing any extra energy reservoirs (unlike, for example, an Eady set-up, which constantly injects energy into the system by imposing a horizontal buoyancy gradient). My understanding of this comes mainly from [Umlauf et al (2015)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/configurable/content/journals$002fphoc$002f45$002f12$002fjpo-d-15-0041.1.xml?t:ac=journals%24002fphoc%24002f45%24002f12%24002fjpo-d-15-0041.1.xml). Their equation (24) applied to the set-up above (i.e. without any boundary stresses and without applying a Reynolds decomposition) reads. ```math; \frac{d}{dt}\int_V \left[ \frac{u_i u_i}{2} + \frac{b^2}{2N^2} \right] dV = ; - \int_V \left[ ; \kappa \frac{\partial_j b \partial_j b}{N^2} ; + \nu {\partial_j u_i \partial_j u_i}; \right] dV \le 0; ```. Also it's worth noting that even in a `(Bounded, Flat, Bounded)` domain I still get an energy buildup, although in this case the KE stops growing after a while:. https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13205162/228590310-51b59910-2550-48c9-93a7-f22d70c2474e.mp4.

This change was important because it's required for checkpointing/restoring large model (implemented in #628). The field tuple constructors are further generalized in #631. Sounds good. Just for the record, `model.velocities` is just a named tuple, so if individual fields can be manually built with pre-allocated data, then so can the named tuples that hold velocity field data and tracer data. I suppose the change here is a function that achieves the same. If the current changes make the checkpointer code clearer, than I am for it. > fill_halo_regions! assumes field.data has a certain size consistent with the size of the grid. Let's be specific here. `fill_halo_regions!` does not assume anything about the ""size"" of data. Specifically, it invokes `getindex` on the property `parent` of `.data` at certain indices. Therefore such a method call must work for `.data`. In the case that `.data` is either a plain `Array` or a `CuArray`, we *know* from the properties of those types when such a `getindex` call for certain indicies will fail. Therefore, we should feel free to intercept such an error during `Field` construction. In other cases we cannot be sure that such a method will fail because we don't know how `getindex` works on `.parent` for arbitrary types. In the spirit of ""not assuming what we don't know"", we should opt to throw errors only in cases that we *know* an error should occur.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/627#issuecomment-587006980:115,update,updated,115,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/627#issuecomment-587006980,1,['update'],['updated']

That's the whole point of the windowed fields abstraction is to be able to properly locate a field in the 3D index space. `eta` is the free surface, so it's indices are at the top of the domain. That's likely the case, since it seems that we are accessing the indexes of the __view__. For example, doing `eta.indices` I get `(Colon(), Colon(), 5:5)`. However, the only way I manage to make work `Field(eta, indices = indices)` is using `indices = (4:8,4:8,-2)`. I think the reason it only works by pass a `-2` (`z` index) results from the fact that the view uses `-2+3`, where 3 is the size of the halo. I've confirmed that changing the halo in the `RectilinearGrid`, changes the value of the (`z` index) to pass to access the `Field`. ```; julia> Field(eta, indices = (1:5,1:5,-2)); 5×5×1 Field{Center, Center, Face} on RectilinearGrid on CPU; ├── grid: 5×5×4 RectilinearGrid{Float6",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3260#issuecomment-2014615658:59,pipeline,pipeline,59,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3260#issuecomment-2014615658,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

The WENO operators were coded so that we can readily integrate them with the existing operators in `tracer_advection_operators`.

Deployability,"> Update: I used the formulas in the paper to approximate the gradient of pressure. In a test case that is pressure dominated, I found that the accuracy imporoved by more than what the theory predicted (> 16), but that is very encouraging that we are doing something right. Note that ""4th-order"" refers to the rate of convergence of the scheme as the grid spacing is reduced. For a particular resolution (and assuming that you are in the ""asymptotic regime of convergence""), the improvement gained from higher-order scheme involves both the rate of convergence / slope of the error estimate as well as a constant (the intercept) that's specific to the problem. As a result, you usually don't have a theoretical prediction for improvement at fixed resolution, I don't think (though I suppose you might be able to generate an estimate if you are differentiating a function with easily knowable properties). Empirically we usually find that higher-order schemes reduce the constant by quite a bit! Which is good --- since we often run marginally resolved problems, improving the constant (rather than the slope/rate of convergence) turns out to be the most important benefit of a high-order scheme. The plot is super busy, but the point is hopefully illustrated: higher-order advection schemes not only converge _more quickly_ to the exact solution as resolution is increased (eg, the slopes of the lines are steeper) but _also_ have reduced error at a _fixed_ resolution (eg, the error is less for WENO5 than CenteredSecondOrder at the fixed resolution 2^7):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/101667154-fba01600-3a1c-11eb-824e-f3ec82367229.png)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1266#issuecomment-741942088:2,Update,Update,2,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1266#issuecomment-741942088,1,['Update'],['Update']

Deployability,"> Using a discretized version of the thermal wind balance is a sound suggestion, but it does not explain why the error only appears when evolving the total fields. Why not? When evolving the total fields, the condition of geostrophic balance is computed during the prognostic evolution of the total variables. When evolving just the perturbation, the algorithm for mean-perturbaiton decomposition _assumes_ that the mean fields are balanced. There is no need to worry about the tiny difference between discrete and continuous balance in the case that you only evolve perturbations. But if you want to evolve the geostrophically balanced state, you must ensure that it is perfectly balanced to within machine precision, or you will have an adjustment. That's the basis for my suggestion. I'm not sure the computation I recommended achieves numerical balance (something might be missing) --- that should be checked.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3251#issuecomment-1712196487:515,continuous,continuous,515,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3251#issuecomment-1712196487,1,['continuous'],['continuous']

Deployability,"> We could procede in a couple of ways from here:. Let me provide a few other options:. * Compute the 2D boolean masks for reduced operations in `x`, `y`, and `z` when forming `ImmersedBoundaryGrid`. Then, use those masks for conditional differencing of reduced fields, rather than calling `immersed_inactive_node`. * For `GridFittedBottom` and `PartialCellBottom`, as a stop gap, define these methods:. ```julia; @inline conditional_δx_f(ℓy, ℓz, i, j, k, ibg::GFBIBG, δx, r::ZIRF, args...) = ifelse(immersed_inactive_node(i, j, ibg.Nz, ibg, c, ℓy, ℓz) |; immersed_inactive_node(i-1, j, ibg.Nz, ibg, c, ℓy, ℓz),; zero(ibg),; δx(i, j, k, ibg.underlying_grid, r, args...)). ```. That use a condition based on whether `k == Nz` is immersed. This will fix fields that are reduced in `z` without increasing memory storage or doing a computation in the immersed boundary grid constructor. And that's the most common case anyways. * When building a `ReducedField`, compute the mask that has to be applied to abstract operations. Then, extend the `_derivative` constructor for the combination of a `ReducedField` argument + `ImmersedBoundaryGrid` using conditional operation. This has the advantage of avoiding the mask computation in `ImmersedBoundaryGrid` (since its only needed to do operations on reduced fields). The disadvantage is that different reduced fields have to redo the computation. Also, this only fixes abstract operations and does not fix the internal operators. We also have to update the conditional operators to throw away the immersed boundary grid for reduced fields, or throw away the immersed boundary grid inside the abstract operation. * A variant on the above approach is to compute the mask when forming `Derivative`. But then a new mask is computed for every operation. There's probably a lot of other options.

Deployability,"> note that our input is the Stokes shear, so I think the most convenient thing to have is the Stokes drift at every level. We can difference that between the top and bottom of a cell to get the ""finite volume averaged Stokes shear"". What do you think about that?. I think it would be good to have the Stokes drift profile available somewhere. So even though only the Stokes shear is used in Oceananigans, I think it is still useful to get the Stokes drift at every level and then differentiate that to get the Stokes shear. >Perhaps it makes sense to start with the Harcourt and D'Asaro 2008 model then? I'll look into that and document what I find here... In terms of implementation the ""theory wave"" is easier -- it's essentially a function of wind speed (the integration over the empirical wave spectrum is done analytically). We just need to apply it multiple time to different depths and then differentiate that to get the layer averaged Stokes drift. For the model used in Harcourt and D'Asaro (2008) we need to do the integration over the empirical wave spectrum numerically. And in addition to wind speed, it also depends on wave age. So I would probably start from the ""theory wave"". I guess it should be straightforward to convert [the Fortran function in GOTM](https://github.com/gotm-model/code/blob/master/src/stokes_drift/stokes_drift_theory.F90) to Julia? . In terms of the resulting Stokes drift profile, ""theory wave"" usually gives a weaker Stokes shear under the same wind. The Donelan et al. (1985) spectrum used in Harcourt and D'Asaro (2008) is for pure wind-wave and gives a strong Stokes shear especially very close to the surface. . I have never used ""theory wave"" to drive an LES. But if we want to approximate the Stokes drift under a wide range of wave conditions with both wind waves and swell, I guess it might not be a bad option at least in an averaged sense?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2290#issuecomment-1055347882:763,integrat,integration,763,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2290#issuecomment-1055347882,2,['integrat'],['integration']

Deployability,"> that looks very weird! But it is structured in some sense, it looks like the initial condition has some inbalances that generate noise which gets cleaned up by numerical diffusion. Interesting also that buoyancy extrema are continuously increasing in magnitude. If this is not happening with z-directed gravity, it might really be that there is some bug/incorrectness in the buoyancy model. A way to test this would be to recreate the same setup with z-directed gravity and use an immersed boundary to represent the tilt. If that case behaves as expected we know where to focus. @simone-silvestri I'm not sure if that'd be an apples-to-apples comparison. We'd be comparing a domain with smooth tilted boundaries (using the rotated buoyancy) against a domain with jagged tilted boundaries (using our grid-fitted IB).

Deployability,"> then we'd have to rewrite loads of stuff to make it so the user can specify whatever they want for the external state. I think see your point (I'm not sure I grasp the totality of it). Is your point that we are able to _re-use_ more existing code if we allow `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` and `DiscreteBoundaryFunction` as `condition`? I didn't understand this previously so thank you for clarifying. To re-use that code with a new `condition`, we can use a nesting technique:. ```julia; function getbc(open_bc::OpenBoundaryCondition, ...); state_value = getbc(open_bc.condition.external_state, ...); # other stuff related to matching; end; ```. This means that we don't have to rewrite anything, we just add new functionality for open boundary conditions on top. You could make the point that we have less _new_ code to write though, if we implement a design that allows conditions to be the same. And for users, this could be clearer, so I see the advantage of that. On the flip side, the advantage of making a new `OpenCondition` is that `getbc` retains its meaning as ""the function that returns the boundary condition value"". When we have an external state + matching scheme, the boundary condition values are not exactly the external state and are modified by the matching scheme. So I see pros and cons to both, but the good news is that we can actually talk coherently about the pros and cons.

I am not sure they use unified memory but they for sure use transposes https://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2014/presentations/S4788-rapid-multi-gpu-programming-cuda-libraries.pdf. Mmm ok. Is this proposal a way to avoid cuffxt basically? I think what you outlined is somehow roughly how PencilFTTs work:. 1. FFT along local direction (dim=1); 2. Simultaneously communicate and permute data to (2, 1, 3) (or is it (2, 3, 1)?); 3. FFT along local direction (dim=2); 4. Simultaneously communicate and permute data to (3, 2, 1); 5. FFT along dim=3. At the end, the data has permutation (3, 2, 1). The backwards transform then reverses this process. `solver.storage` is actually a tuple of 3 preallocated arrays to support this algorithm. For the tridiagonal solver I think we want to use the same algorithm, except that we skip step 1 (ie the first step is to communicate and permute data with no transform). Once the two other transforms are complete we have data in the configuration (x, y, z) where z is local, and we can do a tridiagonal solve in eigenfunction space. Then we transform back and obtain data back in the (z, y, x) permutation, with z local, and copy into the pressure. We have to extend the tridiagonal solver to accomodate this kind of permutation for distributed CPU, so if we have an algorithm like the one above we can then also use it for MultiRegionGrid solves on the GPU.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2523#issuecomment-1119916674:1258,configurat,configuration,1258,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2523#issuecomment-1119916674,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"@francispoulin ! No worries about the question. I like questions. To answer your latest question --- our nonhydrostatic pressure solver is based on FFTs for regular grids and is therefore quite fast. In simple benchmarks long ago we found that other parts of the algorithm dominated the cost of a time-step. Because of that we aren't sure that having a hydrostatic-only solver would help. Of course, the story is different if we need to stretch the grid in horizontal directions. That said, it would still be interesting to be able to solve hydrostatic-only problems. This would complicate the algorithm a bit because you have to distinguish the barotropic mode, and perform a 2D pressure solve. We already have a function to integrate the buoyancy field to obtain the hydrostatic pressure. For ""things I want worked on"" my wish list falls into three categories: new physics features, new numerics / algorithms, and more boring software / UI work. Here's a couple... 1. Finishing the vertically-stretched grid implementation (numerics). We started work on this but its incomplete. This is a tricky and arduous task but would be quite nice to have... 2. Vertically-implicit time-stepping for diffusion terms (numerics). Ocean models typically use a time-stepping method that treats vertical diffusion terms implicitly. We haven't worried about this because we are focused on LES for the most part, or problems with very little diffusion. But ultimately we will need this, especially when we get around to implementing boundary layer closures. We have a tridiagonal solver that works on the GPU, so in some respects the hard work is already done for this problem. 3. Closures for LES and ocean modeling (Dynamic Smagorinsky, Deardorff, k-epsilon, Gent-McWilliams, convective adjustment (?) etc --- physics). We have a need to implement new turbulence closures new and old alike. Gent-McWilliams is probably easy since we already have a Leith closure implemented which calculates the tensor needed to rot",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1153#issuecomment-724262281:726,integrat,integrate,726,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1153#issuecomment-724262281,1,['integrat'],['integrate']

Deployability,"@francispoulin @glwagner @ali-ramadhan @christophernhill ; I took a look at all the benchmarking scripts in our benchmarks folder and realized that many of them are very similar and can be unified. For example, the single script for shallow water model's strong and weak scaling differ only by one substring. ; The latest commit I pushed to this branch unifies all of the launcher and single scripts for shallow water model into three scripts. Now, at the top of the launcher script `distributed_shallow_water_model.jl`, there are two boolean variables that the user can toggle for strong vs weak scaling and mpi vs threaded parallel execution. Everything including output graphs, HTML tables, and info messages also change accordingly based on the two booleans. There are some other features that Francis and I have discussed but would like your approval first before adding them in.; Other possible additions to the script can include a for loop which wraps around the whole launcher script which loops through the strong/weak scaling and mpi/threaded parallelism options to allow for running 4 benchmarks at once. Another possible addition is to have what model is benchmarked also be an option. Granted, I could just copy and paste the shallow water model scripts and replace all instances of `shallow water` with `nonhydrostatic` or `hydrostatic` and tune some options a little bit, but then this would again cause avoidable clutter. Having what model is benchmarked as an easily changeable option can be achieved through a model setup function that dispatches what model is initialized based on a custom model type object that's passed to it.

Deployability,"@francispoulin explained the situation well for `Gradient` and `Value` boundary conditions. I'd like to restate what he said in the context of the finite volume method and clarify the situation for `Flux` boundary conditions because I said something wrong above... Oceananigans uses a weak formulation of PDEs via the finite volume method. We evolve the average value of fields, integrated over a cell volume. In this integral formulation there are two contributions to the tendency of a field: fluxes across cell interfaces (advective and diffusive usually, but also possibly others via user-defined forcing), and interior ""sources"" (such as pressure gradients, Coriolis forces, gravitational forces). When users invoke `Gradient` or `Value` boundary conditions, then the same model is used for fluxes across interior cell interfaces as for ""exterior"" interfaces (domain boundaries). Thus if users set `closure=nothing` and zero out diffusive fluxes, boundary fluxes are _always_ zero regardless of what `Gradient` or `Value` are specified. More specifically, we enforce `Gradient` or `Value` boundary conditions by filling halo regions and then calculating exterior fluxes using the same kernel that's evaluated in the interior. As @francispoulin points out this is not some quirk of our algorithm or numerics; this follows from the properties of the underlying PDE. Something different happens when `Flux` boundary conditions are specified and this is where I was wrong above. With `Flux` boundary conditions, users are really specifying two _different_ models for fluxes: one across ""interior"" cell interfaces, and another for fluxes across domain boundaries. Setting `closure=nothing` in this case only nullifies _interior_ diffusive fluxes. But since boundary fluxes are explicitly specified in this case, they still do have an impact on interior tendency values. . A further subtlety is that `Value` and `Gradient` boundary conditions do actually have an impact if there is non-zero `NormalFlow",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1630#issuecomment-832093191:379,integrat,integrated,379,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1630#issuecomment-832093191,1,['integrat'],['integrated']
Deployability,"@francispoulin sounds like a good plan! Then we can see how to proceed.

These weights are 3 constant parameters, which are quite empirical and ""free-to-choose"" (in our case just `1/10` for the downstream, `6/10` for the central and `3/10` for the upstream stencil). Dissipation can be reduced by increasing the ""central stencil weight"". The idea with @sandreza was to perform an easy calibration to try to ""reasonably"" preserve enstrophy in the Bickley jet (then maybe calibrate it also against the spherical bicklet jet or R-H waves where also Coriolis is involved). The objective is to completely eliminate explicit viscous dissipation in the horizontal direction (harmonic and/or biharmonic) for the global simulation",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2317#issuecomment-1063249741:547,Integrat,Integrated,547,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2317#issuecomment-1063249741,1,['Integrat'],['Integrated']
Deployability,"@francispoulin thanks for starting this discussion!. Broadly speaking I think we would like to implement an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian vertical coordinate in the long run. As far as I understand, implementing an ALE scheme would require more changes than just a new `AbstractGrid`. We need to modify the time-stepping to include a regridding / interpolation stage, and I believe we also need to change the equations being solved (the tendency kernels). . My preliminary thought on software design is that this might be a new model property, something like `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel.vertical_coordinate`. Then one needs to interpret the z-coordinate in the chosen `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel.grid` in light of the choice of `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel.vertical_coordinate`. Other design ideas are certainly welcome!. Something less clear is what happens if we design a terrain following coordinate. Perhaps you are write @francispoulin that terrain following coordinates can be implemented purely by introducing a new type of grid (because the grid is not moving... ?) I think terrain-following, curvilinear grid would require three-dimensionally curvilinear operators, correct? So we would have to update the implementation of the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` operators as well. As for a horizontal grid for `ShallowWaterModel`, since we have horizontally-curvilinear operators I think you might be able to do `boundary_following` in the horizontal once you refactor `ShallowWaterModel` to use horizontally-curvilinear operators.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1549#issuecomment-814206629:1206,update,update,1206,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1549#issuecomment-814206629,2,['update'],['update']
Deployability,"@glwagner ; I am really impressed with your effort to explain to me all details of the implementation. Thanks you!; In the past few days I am learning a lot reading the code/documentation and examples of Oceananigans. When I started this issue, I wasn't really expecting to have Pacanowski-Philander parameterization implemented in a few hours. Kudos to you!!; I know this parameterization is very simple, but implementing it on a FORTRAN-based GCM from scratch would take waaaay more time, at least for me. Can you help me to see if I understood everything correctly? Please, sorry if I am asking too-trivial questions. Why you need to define `f²`, wouldn't work simply using `∂zᶠᶜᶠ` and squaring the operation?. I understand that you create a fake model and don't run it, simply use it to update the auxiliary field. I don't understand why you could not do the same for the main model. For instance, you could first create the model, define Ri and closure and then `set!` the model with this new closure and auxiliary field. Does that makes sense? I understand the in the background this might not work the way it is now. Something like this:. ```; model = HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel(; grid, tracers=:b, buoyancy=BuoyancyTracer()). Ri = Field(KernelFunctionOperation{Center, Center, Center}(Riᶜᶜᶜ, grid, computed_dependencies=(model.velocities, model.tracers.b))). ν = ν₀ + ν₁ / (1 + c * Ri^n); κᵇ = κ₀ + κ₁ / (1 + c * Ri^(n+1)). closure = ScalarDiffusivity(VerticallyImplicitTimeDiscretization(); ν, κ=(; b=κᵇ)). set!(model, closure = closure, auxiliary_fields = (; Ri)); ```. Thinking on a more general way, it would be awesome to give a general function that could depend on any field in the model, including auxiliary. I am thinking that this way it would be easier for users to create and implement their own parameterizations. Including using any model in general that could come in a form of a function. For instance, a ML model could be simply used as a turbulence closure.

Deployability,"@glwagner the idea is that the flow of the script for a user would be something like this:. (1) define a grid; (2) choose an architecture; .; .; code does not change from here on; .; . for this reason I was thinking you cannot have a `DistributedNonhydrostaticModel` vs a `NonhydrostaticModel` as much as you don't have a `CPUNonhydrostaticModel` vs a `GPUNonhydrostaticModel`. About the future direction: I was thinking that `Distributed` could be as much of an architecture as `CPU` and `GPU` are. As an example, there is no GPU.jl module which individually extends all the other modules for gpu execution like the extending the Fields.jl module with a `gpu_fields.jl` in GPU.jl. But I see what you mean when you say boundary conditions and fields have to take the precedence over distributed because it is maybe more linear to extend them in a separate module. Maybe integrating fields and boundary conditions in the respective modules (how is done for CPU and GPU which are not separated) for Distributed might make the code a little too complex and keeping it separate is the way to go. I am all up for that. . Now, discussing the `architecture` vs `grid` problem, step (1) and (2) are interlocked, and choosing which goes first (i.e. grid depend on architecture or other way around?) will make a big difference. At the moment they are kind of independent one another (i.e. some `grids` have an `architecture` field, distributed architecture depends on a grid). . In the future I believe we don't want to have the users fiddling with local_ and parent_ grids. I believe you want them to specify the parent grid, an architecture, and the code takes care of the rest. To achieve that, either a copy of the local or parent grid has to be stored in the architecture type when running `MultiArch`. For the constructor you where talking about `RectilinearGrid(arch=MultiArch; kwargs...)` which returns the local grid, we can do that, but the problem is that the connectivity of the architecture depends",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2073#issuecomment-974677724:870,integrat,integrating,870,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2073#issuecomment-974677724,1,['integrat'],['integrating']

Deployability,"@iuryt speaks truth... it's hard to say something _isn't_ ""feasible"". However, I do think that polishing off an n-layer extension of the existing ShallowWaterModel would require some time. I think you want to write not only the continuous equations, but also the finite volume discretization (and there's some issues around discretization of the advection operator now see #1866). There are some design questions regarding the user interface and the use of existing grids. One possibility is to use the existing grids (which all have a z-coordinate) to specify the _number_ of layers (via the vertical size), but to ignore the vertical grid. Then users would also have to input the buoyancy of each layer (I think I'd prefer buoyancy to density, if that's possible...) But another design might be possible that ""re-uses"" whatever users provide for the vertical grid. I just took a look at the code and was surprised to notice that all of the kernels and fields are already three-dimensional. That means that once the user interface is figured out and appropriate model modifications are made, the ""only"" thing left might be to generalize the kernels... I'm not sure how you do immersed boundaries, or how you blend ""explicit"" bathymetry (added through the pressure gradient) and immersed boundaries.

Deployability,"@jakebolewski I'm wondering what you think about the strategy of running a few key integration tests via GitHub actions, in addition perhaps to unit tests that have low compilation costs. For example, we have a couple ""regression tests"" that ensure the output of a simulation is identical to one run previously. These regression tests are imprecise (we only know that something has changed, but can't identify exactly what it is), but nevertheless catch both obvious API bugs and subtle numerics bugs incurred by refactoring. Another nice feature is that regression tests invoke (or are supposed to invoke) configurations that are most common / most valuable to users. They are also relatively cheap since we load states from a file and run for 10-100 time-steps at modest resolutions, and there are a small number of them which mitigates compilation cost. When I undertake a major refactor I often find myself running regression tests first. Testing corner cases and/or catching bugs associated with interactions between model components in less-frequently used configurations requires more extensive testing (a combinatorial explosion of cases...) and incurs heavier compilation costs; so these are probably better tested via `bors try`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906570444:83,integrat,integration,83,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906570444,3,"['configurat', 'integrat']","['configurations', 'integration']"

Deployability,"@johncmarshall54 agreed, that's a challenge we have to confront. If we implement immersed boundaries using the ""continuous forcing technique"", then a boundary may be defined essentially by a masking function of `(x, y, z)` (it is also possible for it to be a function of time). In this case, we might be able to ""label"" each boundary / masking function with a name or number. The boundary condition objects we then give to fields would have to define a condition to be applied both at the boundaries of the numerical grid (which we currently support), as well as any immersed boundaries, where immersed boundaries are referenced by name or number. By the way, if we use a continuous forcing technique, we do not have to change the pressure solver. This is a major simplification. Recent work suggests there is no disadvantage in terms of accuracy in using the continuous forcing technique over discrete forcing techniques (which I think is the category the MITgcm solver falls under).

Deployability,"@navidcy it shouldn't impact developer workflow too much. When going over the test structure with @glwagner on Tues. I suggested the following restructuring:. * Break-out ""quick"" unit-tests to be run by github actions under a single configuration (ex: linux, julia 1.6) and be able to run them in parallel. We have a ""Team"" account donated by Github so we can have tons of concurrent GitHub actions so this is beneficial if you can take advantage (might be limited by compilation costs). These tests will be run for every PR push and fast fail on error.; * `bors try` trigger a more expensive CI job to be submitted to the cluster, allowing for GPU / MPI tests. The logic here is that if the cpu tests are not working then the GPU tests almost certainly won't so you can get away with executing them less often. We have a daemon running on the cluster that synchronizes the jobs from buildkite with the local slurm controller, so every step in the buildkite config is submitted as a separate slurm job and canceling buildkite jobs kills them with slum. What is nice about that setup is you can tailor the resources used for each buildkite step just as you would slurm (ex. ""gres:1"" for 1 gpu). You can run jobs on multiple ranks, multiple GPU's, different resource limits, timeouts, etc. basically anything you can pass through to as a cli argument to a slurm batch job is supported. Also it's running on a cluster so obviously your job parallelism is very good.; * `bors r+` trigger merging the PR into `main` branch. This serializes the commits to `main` (and roll-up concurrent PR's to be submitted) so that all merge commits will pass the tests. This is an opportunity to also maybe run more expensive tests (it's easy in buildkite to conditionally run steps if running on `staging` branch) because you'll probably only run the staging CI step one or at most a few times at the very end,. the general strategy is to tier the tests so that they get progressively more expensive and to maximize ci-p",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906541778:233,configurat,configuration,233,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906541778,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"@tomchor check out my changes to the tilted bottom boundary layer example: https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2333/commits/d8b455ffe1eabac34e9ef1c21ec70731eae03a74. The most important changes:. * I removed the `BackgroundField` v-velocity, which had no effect on the solution because the domain is `Flat` in y. The only effect of the background flow is through the bottom drag boundary condition.; * I reduced the domain aspect ratio to 400 x 100 because based on the visualization it seemed the domain didn't need to be so wide. This lets us increase the resolution and reduce the diffusivity, which is neat. It's a bit more turbulent now. Minor changes:. * Update style to be consistent with other examples / source code (commas, spaces, etc); * Reorganized the script to read like the other examples / tutorials (like a paper, parameters are introduced when they are used rather than at the top); * Reorganized a few other misc stuff for pedagogical reasons, like building buoyancy + coriolis together; * Note using a tuple for `ĝ` rather than `Array` means it can be used as a parameter on the GPU, so that's probably preferred. Arrays are needed only if we need to mutate elements or perform linear algebra.; * Change tilting angle to 3 degrees rather than 0.05 radians; * Don't import CUDA because the example wasn't GPU friendly anyways (if you like, we can make it GPU friendly but I don't think it should be ""partially"" GPU friendly since it just makes the code more complicated); * When I try to run the example multiple times I get `ERROR: LoadError: NetCDF error: Permission denied (NetCDF error code: 13)`. How can we avoid this error? I think it's important that users can easily change parameters and re-run without having to manually delete a file; this is key to productivity; * Plotting fewer contours makes the animation faster (the most expensive part of this example); * We don't need to form `Field`s any more for the output writers any more.

Deployability,"@tomchor unfortunately we don't have an issue for this problem. @sandreza is it possible to open an issue to document the problem that we are seeing? In the case that this PR does not resolve the issue, we'd like to have an issue open... I don't have much hard evidence to provide but I can describe the problem as I've seen it. Basically, very rare, subtle irregularities have been observed on the GPU when using `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` in a `Periodic, Bounded, Bounded` configuration. I think that it is possible the main issue is an interaction (a read-write race condition) associated with both impenetrable boundary conditions and periodic boundary conditions that affects the 8 corner points. The race condition affects model trajectories via the Coriolis force (which is the only term as far as I know that touches the 8 ""corner"" points affected by this race condition). Because the race condition only manifests when a `Coriolis` or `VectorInvariant` stencil touches corner points, it may not affect _most_ `Periodic, Periodic, Bounded` models, which could explain why we haven't caught it. The reason it doesn't affect those models is because this race condition would only affect the corner points of `w`, which are not touched when using an `FPlane` Coriolis model. However, it's possible (I'm not sure) that the race condition could affect models using `NonTraditionalFPlane` in `Periodic, Periodic, Bounded` configurations. More generally, it will also affect models that are bounded in the `y`-direction, because in those models the corner points of the `y`-velocity are affected and also invoked when using `FPlane` or `BetaPlane` coriolis. That's as much as I know. It's very hard to gather information about this bug because it's so rare are subtle. In other words, only one grid point among 10,000 iterations might be affected, and the errors induced are very small. To find this issue, we have to run tens of thousands of iterations of identical models on the GPU, and then co",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1985#issuecomment-921143865:478,configurat,configuration,478,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1985#issuecomment-921143865,1,['configurat'],['configuration']
Deployability,"@tomchor, I haven't implemented `MultiRegion` for `NonhydrostaticModel` yet. It would be quite easy to extent it if it weren't for the pressure solver which is done in two different ways and both of them are global (`FFT` and `TridiagonalFFT`). A quick and dirty solution would be to do as I have done with the `ImplicitFreeSurface` and reserve the calculation on 1 GPU only. The problem is that the pressure solve is 3D and not 2D so we would probably like to use the `cuFFT` multi-gpu functionality (in particular the cuFFTxt library, which I hope is implemented in `CUDA.jl` although I haven't checked yet) I ll open a PR to start implementing it. Regarding the `OutputWriters`, they are implemented in jld2 trivially with `reconstruct_global_field`. ; You can specify a `JLDOutputWriter` as you do for a single region grid, provided you don't want to slice the direction across the regions ; for example you cannot do; ```; indices = (1:10, :, :) ; ```; for an `XPartition` or ; ```; indices = (:, 1:10, :); ```; for a `YPartition`; (`MultiRegion` does not play well with `indices` at the moment). . It runs, but there is a weird bug for which the fields are not updated as the model timesteps (i.e., all the outputs are the initial condition). I think it is easily solvable but I have to take a deeper look. So basically, it is not working at the moment... On the other hand, to anticipate the `CubedSphere` refactor, we probably want to have `OutputWriters` which output all regions separately (as `reconstruct_global_field` does not mean much in a cubed sphere context). The `OutputReaders`, on the other hand, are completely undefined",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2253#issuecomment-1116860842:1167,update,updated,1167,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2253#issuecomment-1116860842,1,['update'],['updated']

Introduce the predictor velocities in the discretized momentum equation, and then sum the discretized momentum equation in the vertical.; 3. Combine the discretized momentum equation with the free surface equation by taking the divergence of the vertically-summed momentum equation.

Deployability,"Ah ok I see why your original script didn't work now. When executing. ```julia; model = IncompressibleModel(grid=grid,; closure = closure,; boundary_conditions = (v=v_bcs); ); ```. this assigned `v_bcs` to the new variable `v` and passes it to the `IncompressibleModel` function. `v_bc` itself is a `NamedTuple` containing `x, y, z` properties so the `IncompressibleModel` constructor does not complain. Since the named tuple that is passed does not not have a `v` property, the velocities get the default boundary conditions (free slip and no normal flow). Then when you call `set!(model, v=-0.5)` it fills v to be -0.5 everywhere but then `update_state!(model)` is called to ensure that the velocity field is incompressible (divergence-free) by performing a pressure projection step. Since the default boundary condition enforces no-normal flow, the velocity cannot be -0.5 everywhere so the pressure field updates it to be zero to enforce incompressibility. This is a pretty subtle bug (related to #1204)... Since the proper named tuple can't be checked for in the constructor function signature, I wonder if it's worth adding a manual check to make sure a `NamedTuple{(:x,:y,:z)}` was not passed to the model constructor.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1294#issuecomment-756979930:909,update,updates,909,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1294#issuecomment-756979930,1,['update'],['updates']

Deployability,"Ah, it's true that in the continuous equations a Dirichlet condition can be specified without invoking the boundary normal. I'm not sure that holds for us though because we use the weak form of the equations. This means that all the boundary conditions boil down to specification of a `Flux`. In a sense `Value` and `Gradient` are really convenience features that _infer_ what the flux needs to be (assuming second order evaluation of the gradient across the boundary). So I think we need to know about the boundary normal for all boundary conditions... The name ""vector invariant"" is confusing but only refers to the advection of momentum, so I don't think it helps. After thinking about it a little bit I think we can implement a hack that will allow us to proceed for most cases. I think we can prescribe a priori a zero component of the boundary normal component of the viscous momentum flux. This will allow users to specify drag conditions. For example, a drag condition specifies only boundary-tangential viscous fluxes, and has the form `flux = C * u | u |` for boundaries with both `y` and `z` normal vectors (where `| u |` can be correctly evaluated due to masking). To specify a no-slip condition we would also have a normal component of the viscous flux, so we'll have to get a little smarter for that case.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-849952733:26,continuous,continuous,26,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-849952733,1,['continuous'],['continuous']
Deployability,"Ah, thanks for clarifying as clearly I was mistaken. I thought I needed to impose the boundary conditions on the total field, background + deviation. If that's not the case then the boundary conditions are set up correctly. I believe the next thing to try is the same set up but without `BackgroundField` and imposing the Neumann boundary conditions associated with the buoyancy frequency. If that behaves correctly, then the problem would appear to be in `BackgroundField`, as you suspect. . **Update:** ; I made the following changes,. - Removed the background field from model,; - Added `N^2 * (z + D)` into the initial conditiosn of the buoyancy,; - Imposed `buoyancy_gradient_bc` at the top and bottom of the domain. Unfortunately, the same problems occur at the boundary. . This does not seem to be imposing the correct boundary conditions on a tracer field at the top and bottom. **Periodic condition:**; I did try setting the vertical direction to periodic and unfortunately that gave an error, copied below. .

If we want to support these more complicated BC for `Open`, `Value` and `Gradient`, we have to make sure that in all places where we use the `fill_halo_regions!` we also pass as arguments the `clock` and all the `model_fields`, which might be doable. In this case you are hitting this problem in the hydrostatic model because in the `ImplicitFreeSurfaceSolver` there is a `fill_halo_regions!` for velocities that does not pass `clock` and `model_fields`, making julia complain. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/d4bcc095be66c7b5c98a462106285a6f6d341fe1/src/Models/HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModels/implicit_free_surface.jl#L137.

This is because, in the previous transposes we switch partitioning between the in and out free direction while the third dimension remains untouched.

Deployability,"Definitely agree with everything @glwagner said!. > I am very curious to learn about what is currently being worked on. I can share a bit about what I've been working on (and hope to work on). Right now I'm almost done adding some support for Lagrangian particle tracking (PRs #1090 and #1091). After that I'm hoping to upgrade the pressure solver to use 1D FFTs and DCTs for the CPU and GPU (#586, #1007). This would allow us to support all possible topologies on the GPU but might require some playing around with the CuFFT library (see https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl/issues/119). So if you know someone who's interested in FFTs and GPUs (or interested in learning about them!), this might be useful problem to work on! I think some other members of the Julia community would benefit from figuring this out as well. Also hoping to revisit trying to support distributed parallelism with MPI (#590). So if there's someone interested in the nuts and bolts of distributed parallelism, might be great to work on this together!. We also have an early/experimental compressible version of Oceananigans.jl (see #1079 and https://github.com/ali-ramadhan/Atmosfoolery.jl) if you guys are interested in compressible fluid dynamics. > (and I can look at the issues for that I suppose).

Deployability,"EDIT: there were a number of mistakes in the original post here. I've updated it. As for the _profiles_, there are some interesting differences between the ""Brevik"" and ""Lenain"" formulations. In particular, the Lenain profile depends on the _air_ friction velocity `u★`, while the Brevik does not. This is because Lenain divide the spectrum into saturation and equilibrium ranges, and the transition wavenumber between the two _depends on the friction velocity_ (it scales with `1 / u★^2`. Lenain also introduce an ""isotropic wavenumber"", which is an upper cutoff above which short waves do not contribute to the net Stokes drift. This isotropic wavenumber also scales with `1 / u★^2`. In all cases the Lenain model has strong shear at the surface. The effect is less pronounced on a (relatively coarse) grid with dz = 1 m, but still significant. The shear is also not monotonic in `u★`, possibly because the lower-frequency components start to contribute more at higher wind speeds, reducing the shear relative to the surface value of the Stokes drift. Check out the results:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/156649792-02639f67-5d0d-47f3-93f7-e1faa7ad92f9.png).

Deployability,"Ha, @rabernat beat me to it. I just wanted to mention that I am also available for questions and maybe clarify one more point of confusion that seems to stem from our current docs (working on improving that with @tomchor s input). . There are two parts in the NetCDF output that would make the integration with xgcm smooth: ; - Proper metadata for the dimensions (as mentioned by @rabernat above); - Output of grid metrics, which are distances, areas and cell volume of the grid. An important detail there is that each of the metrics should describe properties of the *surrounding cell*. So if you have a tracer value on the point `xT` and the cell bounds are given by a staggered coordinate `xC`, the distance (lets call it `dx`) for each `xT` point should describe the distance between the two surrounding `xC` points (and have `xC` as coordinate, so it can be matched correctly by xgcm). Currently the user has to input these manually but it might be convenient to add the [cf-attribute `cell_measures`](http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#cell-measures), which we might support in the future with a more complete support for cf-metadata (see e.g. https://github.com/xgcm/xgcm/issues/127)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1334#issuecomment-777081849:294,integrat,integration,294,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1334#issuecomment-777081849,1,['integrat'],['integration']

I am skeptical about the value of this test. In general, discretizations _do not necessarily_ represent the balance states of the continuous systems they approximate. Thus in general this test should fail! It will succeed of course in the case that the discrete system shares a balanced state with the continuous state. I think this is flawed as a _test_ because, while certainly formulating discrete systems that share balanced states with their continuous systems is _desirable_, I'm not sure it's something we want to guarantee via CI. We should be allowed to violate this prescription if the discrete system has other _more important_ desirable properties. It could be a nice validation test though. In this particular case, the nonhydrostatic useful is most often used for simulations of _vigorous_ turbulence in which weak flows induced by a violation of hydrostatic balance are likely irrelevant.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1910#issuecomment-890017453:1072,continuous,continuous,1072,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1910#issuecomment-890017453,3,['continuous'],['continuous']

Deployability,"Here are a couple of comments that come to mind when looking at your code. 1. You're using a call to `znodes(Center,grid)`, which indicates that you're using an out-of-date version of the code. I suggest you update the code to the latest version and then try again. It's good to always keep your code up-to-date (especially when posting here) because the code is always being improved upon (and in some instances some bugs get fixed which may be important to your example!). 2. That said, about this:. > Finally, in this case the z-axis is range from -15 to 0, so I can't use `const z₁ = -1*znodes(Center,grid)[1]` because if I do that, the value of z1 will change to 14.88. My code `const z₁ = -1*znodes(Center,grid)[grid.Nz]` will keep z1 equals to Closest grid center to the bottom (0.12). This isn't the best way to define $z_1$. The current statement will break if you, for example, decide to stretch the grid vertically. The more robust way to define $z_1$ is. ```julia; julia> grid = RectilinearGrid(CPU(), size=(64,64,64), extent=(π*H, π*H, H)); 64×64×64 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on CPU with 3×3×3 halo; ├── Periodic x ∈ [1.54466e-16, 47.1239) regularly spaced with Δx=0.736311; ├── Periodic y ∈ [1.54466e-16, 47.1239) regularly spaced with Δy=0.736311; └── Bounded z ∈ [-15.0, 0.0] regularly spaced with Δz=0.234375. julia> using Oceananigans.Grids: zspacing. julia> zspacing(1, 1, 1, grid, Center(), Center(), Center())/2 # Half the distance around a center point; 0.1171875; ```. This is clearer, and will give you the correct value even if you change the grid in the future. Note that in the call to `zspacing()` above, we need to specify the x, y and z positions to get the spacing, but in a `RectilinearGrid` Δz is constant in x and y so those arguments don't really matter. Also note that the code above is written for the most recent Oceananigans version (for which you'll need Julia 1.9). 3.

Deployability,"Here's a few notes on a model with fetch dependence. ## Time-dependence of the spectral peak. Under persistent winds, the sea state continuously evolves.

The difference (the key to this PR) is using the velocity field in the smoothness metric for vorticity reconstruction, rather than the vorticity field. The ordinary WENO algorithm uses the smoothness of the field being reconstructed to produce weights for the candidate stencils. This method is therefore an innovation, since we are using the _velocity_ field to evaluate smoothness for reconstructing _vorticity_. The velocity field is smoother than vorticity, so this generally leads to less-dissipative stencils (but still ""enough"" dissipation to stabilize the simulation). @simone-silvestri definitely has more plots showing differences in spectra and time-series of integrated enstrophy, perhaps he will share!.

Deployability,"Hi @EavenW hope it wasn't too hard to get started (the documentation needs some more work, sorry about that). Not totally sure what you mean by a flux boundary condition with two components (sounds like the u and v velocity fields might be further coupled via this boundary condition?). Sounds like you're trying to impose a (time-dependent?) surface flux boundary condition which can be done a few different ways.; * If it's independent of time then [imposing a flux BC with a 2D array](https://climate-machine.github.io/Oceananigans.jl/stable/model_setup/boundary_conditions/#Creating-individual-boundary-conditions-1) is one option.; * If it's time-dependent then [imposing the flux BC as a function](https://climate-machine.github.io/Oceananigans.jl/stable/model_setup/boundary_conditions/#Specifying-boundary-conditions-with-functions-1) is probably the way to go. The function signature for boundary conditions is `f(i, j, grid, t, U, C, params)` so the boundary condition can depend on time `t`, the velocity fields `U = (u, v, w)` and any tracer quantity in `C`.; * If you can write your surface flux BC as a function of only (x, y, t) then a [`BoundaryFunction`](https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/master/src/BoundaryConditions/boundary_function.jl) can simplify the setup a little. I just realized this isn't showing up in the documentation but the docstring in the file I linked to has an example of how to use it. PS: Not sure which version you're running but we've been making some improvements to the user interface lately which may break certain things if you upgrade to v0.21 or v0.22.

Deployability,"Hi @ma-sadeghi, thanks for opening an issue. This should be possible using a continuous forcing immersed boundary method. It's somewhat crude as it just damps the velocity inside the boundary but is simple to implement and requires no significant changes to the model. For fast flows you might need to damp more strongly (and thus decrease the time step) but the solution should converge as you do so. It's not a built-in feature but is pretty easy to implement by adding appropriate forcing functions to an Oceananigans model. For example, in PR #693 we used such a method to simulate viscous flow around a cylinder (in 2D). Here is the simulation script: https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/ar/flow-around-cylinder/verification/flow_around_cylinder/flow_around_cylinder.jl. These are the most relevant lines: https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/a921fc3edbf795bf4a2193cca84cad41ebdd5625/verification/flow_around_cylinder/flow_around_cylinder.jl#L18-L27. In this case the boundary was described analytically and `boundary(x, y, z)` evaluates to `1` inside the cylinder and to `0` outside. In your case maybe it's easier to describe the boundary or missing nodes with a mask or array (also updated snippet for v0.29):; ```julia; # ... Create boundary[i, j, k] array that's 1.0 inside the boundary and 0.0 outside ... K = 50.0 # ""Spring constant"" for immersed boundary method ; parameters = (boundary=boundary, K=K). # Continuous forcing immersed boundary method ; @inline u_immersed_boundary(i, j, k, grid, clock, state, params) =; @inbounds -params.boundary[i, j, k] * params.K * state.velocities.u[i, j, k] ; @inline w_immersed_boundary(i, j, k, grid, clock, state, params) =; @inbounds -params.boundary[i, j, k] * params.K * state.velocities.w[i, j, k] . u_forcing = ParameterizedForcing(u_immersed_boundary, parameters); w_forcing = ParameterizedForcing(w_immersed_boundary, parameters). forcing = ModelForcing(u=u_forcing, w=w_forcing) ; ```.

Deployability,"Hmm ok. But just to make sure I understand --- you are saying that you _disagree_ with Yang, Park, and Moin (2017) paper, correct? In that paper, they apparently use the Lagrangian-scale-averaged (LSA) SGS model. <img width=""1040"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/15271942/b67188a4-a2e9-4705-955c-7ba42bdd4d3a"">. Of course, whether or not this LSA closure has an issue, there could _still_ be a problem with wall-modeled stresses when using `AnisotropicMinimumDissipation`. (In the above paper, they claim that the SGS model doesn't matter.). I'm curious what happens if you try. ```julia; advection = WENO(order=9); ```. You may also need to add something like `halo = (4, 4, 4)` or `halo = (5, 5, 5)` to the `RectilinearGrid` constructor. I'm also curious what happens if you use `advection = WENO(order=9)` with `closure = nothing`. > Now the problem is that if someone can implement this filtering in the code or not. Are you referring to the time-filtering described in equation 2?. <img width=""1047"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/15271942/f9bb4cf7-06bd-4aef-9965-f7ace6530a44"">. It is not necessary to change Oceananigans to implement this --- it can be implemented in your script. You need to introduce a new field to store the time-filtered wall velocity, and update this field in a `Simulation.callbacks`. It should be straightforward. By the way, I think this should be a Discussion (rather than an issue), because this does not (as far as I can tell) involve a bug of some kind in Oceananigans.

Deployability,"Hmm, so after working on `ContinuousForcing` a bit, I think this discussion needs to be updated:. 1. The keyword we'll provide is `field_dependencies`, as in `field_dependencies=(:u, :v, :T)`.; 2. We'll have to put a function `regularize_boundary_conditions` inside the constructor for `IncompressibleModel`, since fundamentally this function needs to know what the `model_fields` are.; 3. Since `regularize_boundary_conditions` goes inside `IncompressibleModel`, we don't need to modify `FieldBoundaryConditions`. Instead, the boundary conditions can be ""regularized"" prior to being passed to the various field tuples. This may simplify `FieldBoundaryConditions`.; 4. The implementation within `BoundaryFunction` can basically follow what was done for `ContinuousForcing`; the only difference being that, as mentioned above, the `side` at which the boundary function is applied needs to be known for correct indexing.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/897#issuecomment-702327644:88,update,updated,88,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/897#issuecomment-702327644,1,['update'],['updated']
Deployability,"Hmm. I think given general `u, v` we need to solve an elliptic equation to find `psi`, eg `lap(psi) = dx v - dy u`. Then the geostrophic buoyancy field is `b = f * dz(psi)`. For some boundary conditions or assumptions of homogeneity, we can possibly simplify this procedure. One could in principle use the conjugate gradient solver to write a fully general utility, though. Hopefully this task will be taken up once the hydrostatic model is operational. Some care must be taken with the geostrophic mode / computation of the geostrophic free surface displacement for the hydrostatic model. Or, given a geostrophic buoyancy field we can integrate in `z` (eg summation of `b * dz`). This would be the intent of `IntegratedField`, but nobody has implemented that yet. Absent those techniques I think the best method for idealized problems is to use a geostrophic streamfunction. This is illustrated by the Eady turbulence example:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/0153dec98e58b7819ae8e1d57516fc7994694762/examples/eady_turbulence.jl#L38-L41. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/0153dec98e58b7819ae8e1d57516fc7994694762/examples/eady_turbulence.jl#L151-L152.

Deployability,"Hmmm - I am skeptical about that from a computer point of view? In an implicit algorithm and/or radiative transfer alg the next step often depends on the result of the previous steps. . As every CCE graduate student learns, computers take many tens of cycles to evaluate an operation like a an add or multiply. The operation is sequential and carried out in a multi-stage pipeline in the heart of a CPU (or GPU). So unless the compiler has something else for the processor to do, the processor will have to wait for one step to make it through the pipeline before the next step? . I think the normal way to do this is to have some inner horiz blocking that is flexible (and can be 1,1) and then iterate over levels with some intermediate stores? The horiz block can be some fraction of inner cache or GPU local proc shared mem. The math doesn't quite look at this way because it assumes that a+b and/or a*b etc.. happen ""instantaneously"". It does not take into account that the awnser from a*b might take; 5-10 clock cycles to pass through the CPU floating point unit. . I think that is fairly generally true?

Deployability,"I agree that `z_faces` is clearer! I just wanted to be sure we were talking about the same changes. I believe that specifying the grid with `z_faces` does indeed require knowledge of the number of grid points, because the user specification depends on the vertical _index_. The case of a uniform grid illustrates this point: `z_faces = k -> (k - 1) * Lz / (Nz + 1)` for `z = (0, Lz)`. Note that the keyword argument `z` is redundant, since it can be inferred from `z_faces` (by evaluating `z_faces(1)` and `z_faces(Nz+1)`. Thus I am not sure I agree that we should require the `z` keyword argument when `z_faces` is supplied. I think it'd be nice to have both a ""discrete"" interface that uses the `z_faces` or `z_cell_interfaces` keyword argument, as well as a ""continuous"" interface that accepts a ""mapping"" or ""stretching"" function as I described above. With a ""continuous"" interface, the interval kwarg `z` is required because it cannot be inferred from `z_stretching` or `z_map` (whichever we prefer).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1551#issuecomment-815159490:762,continuous,continuous,762,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1551#issuecomment-815159490,4,['continuous'],['continuous']
Deployability,"I agree with this --- though this something similar is already our policy. PRs that have breaking changes are supposed to update the minor version, and also describe the PR in words in the top comment, which certainly includes describing a breaking change. It's true that we don't achieve this, however. We could be stricter in PR reviews?. To make it easier to find the specific PRs that has the change which updates the minor version within release notes, we could have a policy to put the new version in the name of the PR, ie preface the PR with. ```; (0.83.0) Title of the PR; ```. That way one can easily find the relevant PR if there is a long list of PRs within a particular release, only one of which is important. (Note this information can also be obtained via `git blame` on `Project.toml`.). One concern I have is that we struggle to enforce conventions already, like style conventions in source code, branch naming conventions, etc. For example, issues should be labeled --- this issue itself needs a label!. What do we think about working on making PR titles more descriptive and helpful, rather than copying information that I think should be in PRs into release notes? It's nice to encourage people to look at PRs too; we can have conversations there (unlike release notes). As far as breaking changes go, by definition they should be encapsulated in a single PR so I think this will succeed. Another policy change that could help is to require two approving reviews (rather than just one), and to also informally try to be more strict about approving PRs. > Users can have an idea if their code will break with updating, which might prompt them to update more often; (I think in practice lots of users don't update their code regularly since there's a looming possibility of their code to stop running and them having to deal with errors.).

That is a good reason to consider the change. One concern that I have is, as nice as these figures are, I can't really tell much of a difference between column 1 and column 2. Actually, they look pretty identical to me. I can believe that the new method can behave better with the improved accuracy but this example, and the others they consider, don't make this obvous. If they had plotted diagnostics and demonstrated that the new method conserved things better, that would have been more motivation to switch.

Deployability,"I ran a few tests using the [Bickley Jet](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/glw-vw/grid-fitted-incompressible-model/validation/immersed_boundaries/immersed_bickley_jet.jl) with an immersed top wall from the validation script. . ### Surface Normal Velocity; We can easily look at the surface normal velocity of the immersed wall (which should be zero) with increased resolution and see that it is converging nicely, as this method should be exact except for the pressure correction, which will scale. ![Bickley_normal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67593861/122986244-2e807a80-d36d-11eb-924a-074ca0ad127c.png). ### Tracer Conservation; We can also look at tracer conservation. The initial concentration is sinusoidal, so the area integrated concentration is zero over the domain initially. I've plotted both the IBM and non-IBM (lighter colors) results to see the differences. This one is on a log plot. You can see that leakage is happening in the IBM versions. It's hard to say how bad the leakage is here, and it'll probably be better to consider an initial constant concentration rather than sinusoidal to see how much leakage is occurring due to the immersed solid. ![volint_Concentration_log](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67593861/122986580-a058c400-d36d-11eb-9a7c-e3e8d2a7367e.png). It might be easier to see what is going on in the IBM cases without the log scaling:. ![volint_Concentration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67593861/122989251-984e5380-d370-11eb-88cc-ccf4444fb331.png). ### Integrated Boundary Stress; Finally, I looked at the integrated boundary stress along the top wall. The error between the nonIBM and IBM versions at these same grid sizes are below. Unfortunately this is not getting better with increased resolution. This could be due to base state changes causing the stress to change and not necessarily something wrong with the method. It might take better refinement than 256 x 256 to really see a trend here. ![Bickley_",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1733#issuecomment-866285588:753,integrat,integrated,753,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1733#issuecomment-866285588,1,['integrat'],['integrated']

Deployability,"I started tackling this issue in ClimaAtmos last week. I wrote a module, `OutputPathGenerator`, in a separate utilities package ([documentation](https://clima.github.io/ClimaUtilities.jl/dev/outputpathgenerator/)). This module defines an object, `OutputPathGenerator` that can be extended with different `OutputPathGeneratorStyle`s. ; The `OutputPathGenerator` is used in a `generate_output_path` function that takes the base output dir and the style.; The simplest of such styles is ""overwrite"". . The style that is currently being used in Atmos is `ActiveLinkStyle`. Citing from the docs:; > This style provides a more convenient and non-destructive approach. It manages a sequence of subfolders within the base directory specified by `output_path`. It also creates a symbolic link named `output_active` that points to the current active subfolder. This allows you to easily access the latest simulation results with a predictable path. > Example:; > Let's assume your output_path is set to data.; > If data doesn't exist, the module creates it and returns data/output_active. This link points to the newly created subfolder data/output_0000.; > If data exists and contains an output_active link pointing to data/output_0005, the module creates a new subfolder data/output_0006 and updates output_active to point to it.; > If data exists with or without an output_active link, the module checks for existing subfolders named data/output_XXXX (with XXXX a number). If none are found, it creates data/output_0000 and a link data/output_active pointing to it. Atmos uses `OutputPathGenerator` internally. My vision is that end users would be providing the base path and possibly choosing a `Style` if they don't want the default behavior (which is the ActiveLinkStyle). `Styles` are Julia objects and new ones can be defined in scripts by implementing a method for the function `generate_output_path`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3543#issuecomment-2041168662:1284,update,updates,1284,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3543#issuecomment-2041168662,2,['update'],['updates']

The code is already modular with few circular dependencies so I don't think splitting up the repo would be difficult from a purely typing standpoint. I think it's fine if the solvers are specific to `Field` and `AbstractGrid`. One could envision an ecosystem of packages for finite volume calculations on staggered grids:. * `StaggeredVolumes.jl` or maybe `StaggeredFields.jl` (`Oceananigans.Grids, Oceananigans.Operators, Oceananigans.Fields, Oceananigans.AbstractOperations`); * `StaggeredEllipticSolvers.jl` (`Oceananigans.Solvers`) Note that these are both Poisson solvers and Helmholtz solvers.; * We may also want to put the `Simulation` infastructure in a standalone package, because this could be used by any model (not just ocean-specific models); * Anything else?.

Deployability,"I think we can impose a little more structure that eases biogeochemical model development.

This is similar to how `SeawaterBuoyancy` works, in that it provides a concrete structure with a slot `equation_of_state` whereby ""external"" packages like `SeawaterPolynomials` can insert custom behavior. Another possibility is to build out a new abstract type below `AbstractBiogeochemistry` with a function-based interface (somehow). I was also thinking it would be nice to supply a ""continuous form"" interface, so that model developers can implement functions that look something like. ```julia; biogeochemical_transition(x, y, z, t, N, P, Z, D, parameters); ```. rather than having to use the ""discrete form"".

Deployability,"I think we should write a `Field` tutorial that covers this (and everything else...) It's been on my todo list for so many eons. . `fill_halo_regions!` certainly is important. This function fills the halo regions of a field --- that is, a buffer of cells that surrounds the ""interior"" (physical part) of the domain. The halo regions are touched when we evaluate gradients or interpolate across boundaries. They are also used for distributed models (there the halo regions need to be communicated between different regions / processes). In general, the halo regions are linked to the interior values of the field --- so every time interior values are updated, halo regions must be updated for the entire state to be consistent. In short, we need to fill halo regions so that 1) spurious fluxes are not added while evaluating flux divergences across `Bounded` boundaries for `FluxBoundaryConditions`; 2) periodicity is correctly enforced in `Periodic` directions, 3) fluxes are correct for `Value/Gradient` boundary conditions. . I think our philosophy is generally that we want an API in which users don't need to call this function. It's just that people want to do ~~crazy~~ creative and cool!! things and writing an API that supports it all is hard. Or maybe more importantly its a chicken-egg problem so we (developers) need to _see_ the applications in action _first_, then we can design an API (at least for those wild applications out there).

Deployability,"I wanted to comment on the first step, just to make sure everything is perfectly clear. The x-component of the momentum equation can be written as. `` ; ∂ₜu + g ∂ₓη = Gₓ; ``. The first step of the finite volume method is to integrate over the volume and then divide by the volume. This leads to . ``; ∂ₜū + g/Vfcc ∭ ∂ₓη dV = 1/Vfcc ∭ G_x dV; ``. So far we all agree. If we integrate the term with the free-surface we don't get a line integral, we get a surface integral. Using integration by parts, second integral yields. ``; ∭ ∂ₓη dV = ∬ [ η ]_{west}^{east} dy dz; ``. Line integrals happen from Green's/Stokes' theorems but those begin with area integrals.

This is the basic way to implement a quadratic drag from the interface in this PR. In this case what happens under the hood is that we create 4 `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` for the relevant faces of boundary-adjacent cells (the other 2 faces are normal to the given velocity component, so receive a no-penetration boundary condition). So there could be a type instability compiling all of those (which have been notoriously fickle to compile in the past). We clearly need to hard code quadratic drag though, because for stretched grids and partial cells (and other types of immersed boundaries in the future) we have to do precompute the logarithm of the grid metrics (to use in a Monin-Obukhov-type model) in each direction independently, as well as the logarithm of the roughness. It's too much for this PR though, so I think we should just document how to specify no-slip on immersed boundaries (which appears to be performant), and add a few tests. Then in a future PR we can add a `QuadraticDrag` utility (I have a prototype for this object; others are welcome to collaborate on implementing the necessary functions to support it).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2437#issuecomment-1104673081:993,Continuous,ContinuousBoundaryFunction,993,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2437#issuecomment-1104673081,1,['Continuous'],['ContinuousBoundaryFunction']
Deployability,"I'm sort of glad to see @glwagner is verifying the issues we first discussed last year. My 2 cents: . - Small errors in the BC eventually propagating to the whole simulation is unavoidable; this is a well mixed flow. Checking on integrated quantities, such as maintaining conserved properties or matching the expected global dissipation rate, is a more achievable and important goal. ; - Using a test case with some stronger pressure gradients along the boundary would be good as well since this induces much of the error. The circle @wenegrat suggests is the classic, but you might be able to find a more subtle case which is more relevant to your application. Perhaps turbulent flow in a wavy-wall channel?

Following discussion with @johnryantaylor we noticed that it seems the energy increases in all three of these (the velocity clips the colormap which is set to the analytical amplitudes) before it decays.

Deployability,"I've had a go at implementing a proper NPZD model (rather than one I just made up on the fly) and have some thoughts on how we should modify the API:; - I think we need an `required_biogeochemical_auxiliary_fields` like `required_biogeochemical_tracers` because for most models we're going to want the user to at least specify a PAR field (I suppose we may want this to also check the shape of the field because some models may have a pre defined depth dependence of PAR so we might want the user to specify a 2D PAR field rather than doing it properly by integrating a 3D field); - Given what you said the other day about callbacks only being used for features that should be built into Oceananigans we might want to have a think about how a BGC model can specify the attenuation of PAR. You've mentioned that we could define some kind of integrated field?; - It might be helpful to have a simpler interface for advection in biogeochemical models. Although a user could just add another forcing, I think the only way for a model to automatically add an advective forcing is how I've implimented it in the below example. I Think this works quite well since a lot of BGC models write the sinking terms with the other forcing terms, but its a little cumbersome to write e.g. `sinking = div_Uc(i, j, k, grid, bgc.adv_scheme, bgc.u⃗ᵖ, fields.P)`, and model makers will need to do the setup stuff I've done to make the advective velocity fields. You can see my implementation [here](https://github.com/OceanBioME/OceanBioME.jl/blob/Oceananigans-Update/src/Models/AdvectedPopulations/NPZD.jl) and a script using it [here](https://github.com/OceanBioME/OceanBioME.jl/blob/Oceananigans-Update/examples/NPZD.jl) since I thought it was probably too complicated for the test (and will change that back to a 1 variable model later).

Deployability,"I've played more with this now and think the way we can do this with the minimum code changes is as follows. The only other way I can see is for the boundary to store the previous timestep of the boundary adjacent points but since Fields depends on BoundaryConditions that isn't really possible. The key problem really is that previous solutions to this problem have been written in codes that store at least two time levels which we don't have. So, if we consider for now just a 1D problem with boundary point $\phi_b$ and interior points at $\phi_{b-1}$ etc. When we go to update the boundary point we have $\phi_b^n$ and $\phi_{b-1}^{n+1}$ and we want $\phi_b^{n+1}$. As per previous work we assume that the bulk speed is the same at both $b$ and $b-1$ but we don't have both the spatial and time derivatives of the $\phi$ interior at the same step so we first need to approximate the previous step as:. $\phi_{b-i}^n = \phi_{b-i}^{n+1}-\Delta t G^n_{b+1}$. We can then find the bulk velocity at timestep n as:. $U_b^n = -\frac{2\Delta x_{b-1}G^n_{b-1}}{\phi^n_b - \phi^{n+1}_{b-2} - \Delta t G^n _{b-2}}$. We then have all the information to step $\phi_b$ to:. $\phi_b^{n+1}=\phi_b^n-\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x_b}U_b(\phi_b^n-\phi_{b-1}^{n+1} - \Delta t G^n_{b-1})$. This will require us to give the boundary condition both the tendencies and $\Delta t$, but this seems to be the easiest thing to change. I also think this is the only way we can get a physically sensible bulk speed where all of the components are calculated at the same timestep. I have also realised that we need to have an exterior value for every open boundary for when the flow spontaneously becomes an inflow so I think it would make sense to have every open boundary be the same and just be `OpenBoundaryCondition(external_value)`, and then put the tendencies etc in as arguments to `_fill_X_halo!`. Then when `U_b` is negative we either set the value or do nudging like in ROMS to prevent shocks (but I think this is a quest",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3482#issuecomment-1971616810:575,update,update,575,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3482#issuecomment-1971616810,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"I've worked out where my problem is coming from. For the wall-normal velocity: first, we compute and apply the tendencies from 1:N face points, then compute the pressure correction at 1:N center points, then fill the boundary points at 1 and N+1, and apply it at 1:N face points (except the gradient is zero across the 1 face point so this doesn't do anything to the boundary. The N+1 boundary point is fine because we can just set it to anything, or time integrate something at the point since nothing else effects its value. The same is true if we prescribe a value at the 1 face point because (even though we redundantly integrate the tendencies there) it just gets reset to whatever we want. The problem is if we try to integrate something like a radiation condition there then we actually end up with $u(1, j, k) = \int (G_u + B_u) dt$ where $B_u$ is whatever integration we're trying to do at the boundary.

Deployability,"In my last commit, I changed how boundary conditions are internally initialised as before we were passing the name of the classification so that we could catch functions and turn them into `Discrete/ContinuousBoundaryFunction`s, but this was causing a problem when I wanted the classification to also have properties (i.e. the matching scheme in this case). . Instead, I've changed it so we pass an instance of the classification (so e.g. we can pass `Open(SomeMatchingScheme())`) and this seems to work fine still. . The boundary conditions setup tests now pass locally and I will wait to see how the rest of the tests do, but is there any problem with this change otherwise @glwagner?

Deployability,"In terms of the validation experimens, from what I understand, they are created when someone does something new and the script is a proof by example, or sorts. Since they are never run in tests they do become stale, and a bunch no longer run, as has been pointed out. The same can be said for benchmarks. . Examples are great because they are continually tested and therefore updated as needed. There are a bunch, but still, I don't think as much is covered in the examples as we see in validation. It would be nice for people to see whats in validation, but if they don't work then that causes other problems. I don't claim there is a simple solution but I'm glad we're talking about it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1797#issuecomment-872510039:376,update,updated,376,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1797#issuecomment-872510039,2,['update'],['updated']
Deployability,"In this case if we see convergence with decreasing time-step (spatial resolution isn't relevant for these dynamics, which are at the grid scale and therefore not physical) then I suppose that would be an indication the issue is due to a finite time step. It's important to recognize that the dynamics of the _discrete_ linear equations are different than the continuous. When we have a smooth solution, such that our spatial discretization should approximate some exact smooth solution, we can test that refining the grid and time step leads to convergence to an exact solution. Moreover, we can estimate the time-scale of the dynamics using the time-scales of the smooth dynamics as a guide. An example is a resolved buoyancy oscillation: it has a timescale of roughly 1/N. This example is dominated by small amplitude (eg linear) noise at the grid scale. Therefore my initial time scale estimate of 1/N may not hold. Instead, we'd have to look at the discrete eigenvalues of the system at the very higheset wavenumbers (ie the Nyquist number 2pi / dx). We could then calculate the time-step that would be required to resolve these (completely unphysical) dynamics. I'm not sure what a lower bound on such spurious discrete dynamics might be. It could be far smaller than any physical time scale, ie as small as 1e-16, or smaller? Perhaps the evolution of grid scale noise also has to do with spatial resolution, so that could be another knob to vary. So if we want to investigate this further, we should conduct a systematic study of the dynamics of this grid-scale noise system affected by buoyancy, decreasing the time-step to zero. Or we can convince ourselves that non-noisy dynamics _are_ accurate --- eg by analyzing a system like the one we use for our ""internal wave"" dynamics test:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/main/test/test_internal_wave_dynamics.jl. that test verifies that a wave packet in our code propagates at the correct group speed, for example.

Deployability,"Indeed the pressure solver at the moment allows only a variable z-direction. This is because for a regular grid we can use a full FFT solve while with a singular stretched direction we can solve a tridiagonal system. . For more than one stretched direction we should use an iterative solver to solve the Poisson equation (the solvers are there but the infrastructure not quite yet). We should implement the iterative solver as a default for two or more stretched directions. And set up the FFT-tridiagonal solver as default when we have one stretched direction (either x, y or z).

Deployability,"Interesting, thanks for those details! That's odd that there are changes in memory allocation associated with building diagnostics. I don't think there's been changes to `Field` between 0.77.5 and 0.78.0. @navidcy might be able to say more. I think 0.78.0 only upgraded the tests to julia 1.8?. I'm also curious why the diagnostics consume so much memory. Are you producing a lot of 3D time averages (which can't be constructed in post-processing?) We've attempted to design the code so that reductions can be performed with minimal memory allocation. 3D diagnostics can simply be calculated from snapshots of the model state, so there's no need to allocate memory (assuming that static memory greatly exceeds GPU memory, this would be preferred).

Deployability,"It's as @simone-silvestri said, more broadly it seems that we need to think of boundary conditions differently between `Face` fields and `Center` fields. `Face` fields have nodes on the boundary (sometimes we call those ""peripheral nodes""), so we simply impose boundary values to satisfy boundary conditions, eg for determining wall-normal velocities. `Center` fields have nodes within and outside, but not on the boundary. This is the core of the discussion @simone-silvestri and I had about tracer boundary conditions: we can choose either to set the tracer halos to produce a result when tracers are reconstructed _on_ the boundary (that's how `Value` and `Gradient` boundary conditions work -- the halos are determined by extrapolation). Or, we can set the tracer halos as if the halo region is part of some other prognostic state (which is what I envisioned `Open` should do). Finally as @simone-silvestri says the tracer halos are `0, N+1` while wall-normal velocity points _on_ the boundary are `1` and `N+1`. I think its fine to pass additional arguments to `fill_halo_regions!`, and use these for open boundary conditions. In fact, `DiscreteBoundaryCondition` and `ContinuousBoundaryCondition` appear to already be designed to accomodate additional arguments that are unused by those user interfaces (note the `args...`):. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/643b484e81e0aeb038b3038266912ad051bce9b8/src/BoundaryConditions/discrete_boundary_function.jl#L45 . https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/643b484e81e0aeb038b3038266912ad051bce9b8/src/BoundaryConditions/continuous_boundary_function.jl#L136-L137",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3482#issuecomment-1972507075:1174,Continuous,ContinuousBoundaryCondition,1174,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3482#issuecomment-1972507075,1,['Continuous'],['ContinuousBoundaryCondition']

Deployability,"Its ok for there to be a divergence in the slip velocity. In the case of the ocean surface or seafloor that's exactly what you want since the particles will then accumulate at those surfaces depending on whether they are light or dense. Tracer is conserved in an integrated sense since the flux through the boundary vanishes. In some cases the user might want a flux across the boundary, e.g. for dense particles sinking through an open boundary at the bottom of the domain, so we probably want the profile of the slip velocity in the user's control. Also, note that for very buoyant tracers there will be numerical issues if the tracer all accumulates at the surface. Finer grid spacing can help a bit, but I think this is a drawback to using buoyant tracers and particles work better in those cases (Jenny discusses this in her draft paper on microplastics which is under review).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2389#issuecomment-1082411718:263,integrat,integrated,263,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2389#issuecomment-1082411718,1,['integrat'],['integrated']

Deployability,"Just as an update --- we actually currently cannot do this verification experiment because of a problem with LES models (a theoretical problem, not an implementation problem) with specified buoyancy flux boundary conditions and zero stress boundary conditions. In short, we observe grid-scale oscillations in the near-surface buoyancy gradient when buoyancy fluxes are specified. The primary issue is associated with a too-small near-surface LES diffusivity. . I want to emphasize that this is not a numerical issue with boundary condition specification, or a bug in the LES implementation --- this is a fundamental, theoretical problem with LES formulation. Others have observed this issue before with a variety of LES formulations, so this issue is not particular to AMD, either. I'm working on a fix because this is an important, canonical problem. The easiest way to fix the problem is to allow the LES model constant (which we should view as a free parameter) to vary in space and in particular to increase near the wall. This is simple, yet completely empirical solution. . The level of empiricism / near-wall enhancement of the model constant needed for a smooth solution is mitigated somewhat if we can specify the gradient of buoyancy / temperature on the boundary. This second component of the fix can be done by introducing a wall model on top of the interior LES formulation that applies *on* boundaries. The wall model introduces a second free parameter in addition to the interior LES free parameter. Adjusting the wall model's free parameter allows us to ""effectively"" increase the near-wall value of the AMD diffusivity. An even better, more complete fix would also modify the interior LES model near the wall.

Deployability,"Just to be clear, the point of doing this is because you want to use dispatch to write flexible array operations that are agnostic to whether the array is a 'raw' array (like an `Array` or `CuArray`), or some kind of wrapper like an `OffsetArray`. By writing `parent(a)`, you ensure correct behavior on `a` in both cases; you don't need to write new high-level functions for wrappers versus arrays because dispatch is performed at the lower level, where it belongs. With `data` we can use the same logic --- this concept is deployed extensively in PR #463.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/454#issuecomment-542269350:524,deploy,deployed,524,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/454#issuecomment-542269350,1,['deploy'],['deployed']
Deployability,"Just to clarify things a bit for you @loganpknudsen --- your error says. > ERROR: LoadError: Failed to precompile Oceananigans. this means that the segmentation fault occurs during precompilation of `Oceananigans`, which occurs before any code you have written executes.

Deployability,"Just to frame the discussion: this is probably most important in the context of new users or scientists trying to read examples, docs, and scripts that implement numerical experiments for scientific purposes. In that context I agree with @ali-ramadhan that `BoussinesqModel` is misleading for models with `tracers = nothing` and `buoyancy = nothing`. I think we've also discussed making this default, since its simple... As for the distinction between hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic models I agree that with currently supported configurations, `NonhydrostaticRigidLid` is better than `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. I'm only hesitant about this change because I wonder if we may want to combine these two models in the future. The motivation to develop `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` separately is largely practical and caves to short term timeline pressures (it's easier to break things when nobody's using it, and we throw a warning right in the constructor so people know its experimental). In the long run it might make sense to have just a single interface to all incompressible models and support all combinations of hydrostatic, non-hydrostatic, free surface / rigid lid, etc through a single interface, similar to what MITgcm offers. The interfaces / model specific code is expensive to maintain, which motivates having just one interface. If this is our goal, it'd be premature to change the name of `IncompressibleModel`. If people feel they'd like to commit to maintaining two interfaces / model constructors / time-stepping code then I think changing the name to be clearer but less general is an option to consider. I personally would rather maintain as few `AbstractModel` as possible because I feel they are fairly expensive in terms of person-time to maintain. And we probably have a lot of improvements that need to be made (features like `model.auxiliary_fields`, `VectorField` for velocity field rather than baking in the coordinate system which fails on the cubed sphere), proper su",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1620#issuecomment-827842772:529,configurat,configurations,529,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1620#issuecomment-827842772,2,['configurat'],['configurations']

Deployability,"Looks good to me. My only question is about the derivation of ``wˢ``, which results from a vertical integration of the analytical functions. Currently this integral is performed under the assumption that ``wˢ`` is zero at large depths, which I clarified in the code:; https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/06f6ac746742d08c78b3cfed0bd40f7df4392819/src/StokesDrifts.jl#L213-L215. **Is this the correct assumption here?** It effectively means that ``wˢ`` and its gradients are a maximum at the surface under a depth-decaying Stokes drift, so any horizontal convergence/divergence of Stokes drift manifests a local change in sea surface height:; https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/06f6ac746742d08c78b3cfed0bd40f7df4392819/src/StokesDrifts.jl#L248-L250. An alternative would be to set ``wˢ`` to zero at the surface, which would cause ``wˢ`` and its horizontal gradients to reach a maximum at large depths, as the occurrences of ``ûˢ(z)`` above would become ``( ûˢ(z) - ûˢ(0) )``. Essentially, horizontal convergence/divergence would manifest as downwelling/upwelling (rather than SSH changes in the current case). I feel like this approach makes sense for LES setups, but it could cause problems for simulations of the full water column where you don't want direct Stokes drift effects deep in the ocean interior.

Deployability,"Now that the spacing functions are in place, I'm going to start working on this. (I'll update the top post with the information below.). The goal here is to add grid metrics to NetCDF output. The are two main avenues to follow:. 1. We can follow Oceananigans nomenclature and conventions, which would make the output play more nicely with Oceananigans itself (and more generally in the Julia environment).; 2. We can follow standard community conventions, which would mean the output won't follow Oceananigans naming etc., but it would optimize its readability by other software. I think we should follow option 2, since if a user wants to work with the output in Oceananigans/Julia, then using JLD2 output is probably the right choice anyway. Given that most people in the community use Python, `xarray` and `xgcm` to analyze model output, I think we should optimize the output to work with that ecosystem out of the box. Based on the discussion in https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1334, it seems the preferred conventions to use are the [SGRID conventions](https://sgrid.github.io/sgrid/). For the more technical aspects, I'm planning on starting with `RectilinearGrids` and `LatLonGrids` in this PR since these are more straightforward. And then we can expand from there.

Deployability,"OK, let me put my 2 cents. If we have the validations in the docs just because of the animations then we should just put the animations on YouTube or somewhere and point people there. Having the non-working versions of, e.g., `lid_cavity.jl` script in the repo and in the docs has lead many new users in the rabbit hole of figure it out. Then users feel that scripts are not working, sometimes they post an issue or ask in Slack. But who know how many other users are simply discouraged. Personally, if I download a code that includes non-working pieces of code I am very discouraged. Thus, bottom-line: I see @glwagner's point that the functionality or pipeline for maintaining healthy validations scripts (even a subset of them) then *only those* should be included in the Docs. `Sandbox`: I'm so against a `sandbox` directory! It's like keeping your trash bin in your house for ever in case there is something useful there. I used to to it all the time: I'd keep commented out code in my scripts... But I think it's a bad practice. We need to let go. The repository and the tagged versions should not include half-bake scripts and what not. I'm happy with a sandbox repository `Oceananigans.jl-sandbox` where we keep things. Or a `sandbox` branch even. Regarding this PR and what's should be kept in the Docs: I vote we keep the convergence tests in the docs and nuke the validations. I agree with the git history size issue and probably the method of including the `.png` files that @ali-ramadhan suggests would work -- I've never done it though.

Deployability,"OK, perhaps I'm a bit oblivious to physics of tilted gravity etc. Are is the tilted gravity crucially important for this to occur?. Also, is there an energy integral associated with these dynamics when there is a fixed imposed buoyancy? Even in the continuous case, before we go to discrete world, is there guarantee that E should decrease?. Usually systems with imposed mean flow _do not_ have an energy integral. This is a side-effect of the system not being energetically closed since something is continuously putting energy in to keep that mean flow fixed. E.g., Phillips 2-layer baroclinic instability where an imposed mean flow is kept fixed then kinetic energy grows... I'm not sure if this imposed mean buoyancy does this in this example, but here's an example in which the imposed mean flow does not guarantee that kinetic energy will decay:.

Deployability,"Ok @navidcy I've updated the parameters. For the sake of documentation: these parameters were obtained by calibrating CATKE against 5 LES from LESbrary's ""4 day suite"" at 8m resolution. The defaults are now the ""best"" parameters at the end of that calibration. The last iteration of the calibration produced these plots:. <img width=""687"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/155354710-33778efc-b52a-4fdb-a54d-e9ba97c4bda1.png"">. The blue line is the forward solution produced by a column model with CATKE using the best parameters. The TKE is a bit off, and the velocity profiles aren't ""perfect"" (still very good); but the buoyancy profiles are near perfect. I have some ideas for improving CATKE further, but it's going to take a bit of time. I think moving forward the right approach is to always use CATKE's default configuration for experiments. Then, whenever we update CATKE we'll take a new version. That way we can figure out what CATKE flavor we used by referencing the Oceananigans version. Also for documentation, here's a screenshot of the parameter values from the end of the calibration:. <img width=""1549"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/155355188-089d306f-32ae-46ed-a5e1-f70d3b16f4df.png"">. The defaults were copied from that screenshot. @navidcy I think @rafferrari is referring to any time-step constraints that CATKE might impose. You should be prepared to take short time-steps between 10s and 1 minute during the initial stages of the simulation (while the TKE profile is rapidly adjusting to the initial condition + forcing). Hopefully we can take longer time-steps later on.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2273#issuecomment-1048925824:17,update,updated,17,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2273#issuecomment-1048925824,3,"['configurat', 'update']","['configuration', 'update', 'updated']"

Deployability,"Okay interesting!. I'm not sure why you would need `gcc`. Have you tried omitting that?. Also, did you try installing julia yourself? There could be some benefit in using the system Julia via `module load julia/1.9.2`, but this would mostly have to do with compilation speed (not execution speed) I think. If you have found discrepancy between the system Julia vs your own Julia install that'd be interesting to hear about... You could also let julia handle netcdf --- again, I'm not sure if this would have performance implications or not, but it might provide faster way to get up and running if you are simply trying to run scripts.

Deployability,"Okay, thank you very much for the clarification about hydrostatic vs. nonhydrostatic pressure! The hydrostatic pressure integral:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/e76deefc1fdf115e05856a18977c593d0b5d3b0d/src/Models/NonhydrostaticModels/update_hydrostatic_pressure.jl#L15. does indeed use tracers; in addition it involves a reconstruction / interpolation that _might_ be affecting results here. Bug perhaps? I say ""might"" and ""perhaps"" because the precise mechanism isn't clear to me. Since we integrate downwards, there's only an error in the hydrostatic pressure _below_ the immersed boundary. Hmm... Note, this particular issue is not fixed by ""unmasking"" tracers (it's just that the bug / error is different, and perhaps less innocuous).

Deployability,"One idea to avoid a huge amount of refactoring could be to define something like. ```julia; default_float_type = Ref(Float64); ```. Then to change to float32 we'd write. ```julia; Oceananigans.default_float_type[] = Float32; ```. Next, everywhere we've written `FT=Float64` we change to `FT=default_float_type[]`. Basically that adds a global variable that users can modulate at the top of a script. We'd also have to introduce type parameters here and there wherever `Float64` was hardcoded (eg `TimeInterval`).

Deployability,"Probably related:. I saw the new `Simulation` API and the new `Callback` idea. This brought a change: the old way of building a Simulation included a `parameters` arguments. This `parameters` was accesible from the `progress` function. With the new way, we build callbacks and then register them, but there is no way to pass additional parameters to it. . In one of my usages I was hacking a progress function https://github.com/aramirezreyes/RamirezReyes_ShallowWaterInFPlane/blob/c1971c0cb3fc99fbb2dbf3303a8fd60b17a59d5a/scripts/run_oceananigans_example_cpu.jl#L101 to update some arrays on a parameterization. Unfortunately, this depended on the `parameters` argument. The more generalized idea of the `callbacks` is very elegant and works nice, but it loses some power from the lack of ability to add additional parameters to the callback function. Is there a way to recover this ability? (there are other ways of getting it to work but having it in the design would be nice).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1895#issuecomment-1001102006:571,update,update,571,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1895#issuecomment-1001102006,1,['update'],['update']

I think what would help the most is a simple benchmarking script that compares identical forcing function implementations with `ContinuousForcing` and `DiscreteForcing` to no forcing.

Deployability,"So in summary, a future effort should take these steps:. 1. Write a function like `substepped_tracers(bgc::AbstractBiogeochemistry)` that can be extended by a hypothetical substepping BGC implementation.; 2. Prototype this concept by implementing a new (hopefully simple, one tracer) BGC model, and prototype the time-stepping algorithm that substeps the tracer forward during `update_biogeocemical_state!`. This should be easy to merge since it only requires defining the one new function `substepped_tracers` for skipping the tracer update. Furthermore, the prototype will demonstrate that the substepping is useful for a stiff problem, and will also develop a substepping scheme. Next, we can consider building an interface for doing the substepping itself, much like we have an interface for doing ordinary time-stepping. That will require a bit more design, but I think the initial prototype will give us a lot of information about the best way to go about it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3888#issuecomment-2455678251:535,update,update,535,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3888#issuecomment-2455678251,2,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"Some progress:. The type infererence issue seems to be fixed. For `flow_over_hills.jl` the cost per time-step is approximately the same on my CPU for the ""reference case"" (no immersed boundary), and either free-slip or no-slip immersed boundary. I updated `flow_over_hills.jl` to introduce an initial perturbation that goes turbulent immediately. Here's a visualization of vorticity alongside total momentum loss for a 64x64 resolution:. https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/163830810-8f15244b-27e2-4bf0-a7b2-e35d73bd8c79.mp4. The ""reference"" case has a no-slip boundary but no bathymetry. The momentum loss between reference and free-slip case are similar. No-slip and immersed boundary has the most momentum loss. The effect of the pressure errors can be seen plainly that there is transient _injection_ of momentum into the system, which isn't physically possible. However over long periods of time the momentum goes in the right direction. I'm wondering if anyone has experience with PALM, which I believe uses a very similar immersed boundary method (with no pressure solver correction)... ? They must have similar ""leakage"" errors.

We need values for the grid coordinates `λᶜᶠᵃ`, `λᶠᶜᵃ`, `φᶜᶠᵃ`, and `φᶠᶜᵃ` so that we can use `set!` for velocities on the cubed sphere. They are not provided by the file but we should be able to convert the available coordinates back to the cubed sphere face in (ξ, η) coordinates where -1 ≤ ξ, η ≤ 1 which forms a regular grid then interpolate in between and back to the sphere to get the other staggered grid coordinates. 5. We need to use the sine and cosine of the local angle between the grid orientation (e.g., u-velocity) and zonal west-east direction at the grid-cell centers to `set!` velocity fields. Right now we're limited to setting velocity fields from a streamfunction... 6. Should we be filling the halos of the grid metrics? Seems like they should be filled like velocity halos but without any sign changes. 7. Make sure that calling `fill_halo_regions!` on a horizontal velocity field only fills the halos with non-`CubedSphereExchange` boundary conditions. 8. Add the cubed sphere passive tracer advection and surface gravity waves validation experiments to validation CI pipeline. 9. Figure out a way to abstract and clean up `fill_horizontal_velocity_halos!` and `fill_*_halo!`... 10. Merge utils from `src/CubedSpheres/cubed_sphere_utils.jl` and `src/Distributed/distributed_utils.jl` into `Oceananigans.Grids`. 11.

Deployability,"Thank you for your feedback @maleadt! What is CUDAnative compilation? If you mean the precompilation phase when CUDAnative is first loaded, then it's not that as I start timing after all packages are loaded. I thought 6-7 minutes was normal/expected as @vchuravy et al. reported similar GPU compilation times for their shallow water model: https://github.com/JuliaLabs/ShallowWaterBench. I haven't done any rigorous benchmarking yet but out of those 6 minutes, ~1.5 minutes are spent on compiling code that creates CuFFT plans (the first plan takes 1.5 minutes then the others take <1 second). From watching the log I'm guessing the other 4.5 minutes are evenly split between setting up the model (creating CuArrays, initializing them, etc.) and the first time step (where the kernels are getting compiled presumably). I don't think we have that many kernels (just 5 bigger ones) but one of them; https://github.com/ali-ramadhan/Oceananigans.jl/blob/2b64d584c79ece0429f2421335ddb6bc0c6c6663/src/time_steppers.jl#L213; has several layers of inlining (it's inlining the majority of the functions in [operators/ops_regular_cartesian_grid_elementwise.jl](https://github.com/ali-ramadhan/Oceananigans.jl/blob/master/src/operators/ops_regular_cartesian_grid_elementwise.jl)) after which it probably balloons up to be a pretty big kernel. They also have tons of arguments crammed in as the structs I was passing weren't `isbitstype` (working on this #59). I should come back and update this issue once we do some proper benchmarking (note to self: nvprof seems like it's being deprecated in favor of Nsight).

Deployability,"Thanks @ali-ramadhan that is some great advice and will certainly make the changes you requested and try and not forget these lessons for the future. . For starters, here are Hovmoeller plots of h, uh, and vh from the 1D case. Note that I tried it in the x and y directions and I'm glad to say they produce the same results, except for uh and vh are switched. ![Hovmoller_vh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8239041/101361249-b6d57d00-386c-11eb-90da-552784ea98b7.png); ![Hovmoller_uh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8239041/101361250-b76e1380-386c-11eb-91cd-672bd56da677.png); ![Hovmoller_h](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8239041/101361251-b76e1380-386c-11eb-859a-218361e43d7f.png). Second, this is a plot of the solution for the 1D case that starts off with no motion and a Gaussian field for height. This is a nice example of geostrophic adjustment, and can certainly be compared to papers that do such things. ![one_dimensional_shallow_water_x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8239041/101361665-45e29500-386d-11eb-82d8-f440f3b07d80.gif). Third, I have done a 2D case and everything looks qualitatively the same, but it is much more diffusive. This is a plot of a slide through the centre that should reproduce the same thing as above, but the amplitudes are much weaker. This is only 64x64 so it's not very high resolution but I should probably change the advection scheme to make it more accurate. ![one_dimensional_shallow_water_2D_x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8239041/101361578-251a3f80-386d-11eb-8e59-8c02e271cfcc.gif).

It occurs to me that if we solve for the buoyancy using array operators at the beginning, then we can specify the`BackgroundField` using arrays. Should that work?

Deployability,"Thanks @navidcy for the reply. This is helpful. This means that when we integrate the zonal momentum equation over a volume (as part of deriving the finite volume method), we get the vertical integral in the `z` derivative and hence why we get the flux at the top minus the flux at the bottom.

I wonder if making it a required argument would that help with #3800 by making sure users won't forget to pass the grid to set the float type.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3857#issuecomment-2435301292:171,update,updated,171,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3857#issuecomment-2435301292,1,['update'],['updated']
Deployability,"Thanks for the feedback @glwagner and @tomchor . I will respond soon but I have an updated I wanted to share. I did a simulation in each for 100 time steps a few times each. I found sometimes the second simulation was way faster than the first. For different advection schemes I found, to my surprise, they do scale differently. ```; scheme ratio; ====== ===; C2 1.7; U3 2.4; C4 3; U5 2.4; W5 3.4; ```. I would not call these offical benchmarks but more back of the envelop calculations (between friends). But these numbers are, mostly, around 3, which is what I expected. . For fun, I will do the same thing with GPUs (and will find out if my new code runs on a GPU). I guess one mystery is why is it that my actual simulation ran so slowly?

Deployability,"Thanks for working on this @navidcy! I'll try to `git merge master` which should fix some tests and then I'll look at fixing the other failures. > A question that comes about is that after this PR: do we test *only* on v1.6? If so, how are we making sure that code works smooth on v1.5? Should we test on both? Should we bump the julia compat requirement in the `Project.toml` file to `^1.6`?. Ideally yeah we would test on both 1.5 and 1.6 but I don't think we have the CI resources to do so :(. We could set up some GitHub Actions pipelines to test Mac and Windows with 1.5 and only run a subset of the tests so it doesn't massively slow down CI. It wouldn't be comprehensive but we'd get more coverage. Not sure if we'll have to only support Julia 1.6+ only soon, but that would save us from having to test on 1.5. We might not want to jump ship to 1.6 too soon though. I experienced longer compilation times when using Julia 1.6 in developing PR #1522 so I had to switch back to 1.5. Maybe I just had a weird setup though, I should investigate more carefully. I could be the only one who's had issues...

I believe with the methods we are using, we only ever need the normal direction of the ""numerical"" or discrete IB. Actually I think we should call _that_ the ""true"" IB; if there's a continuous function from which the discrete specification is derived, maybe we can call that the ""IB generator""? Right now this ""normal"" direction is always aligned with a cardinal direction of the grid (east, west, etc...).

Deployability,"Thanks, that's helpful @jagoosw. Just one more thought... I realized after I did the testing for my previous post that the hang occurs at ""Initializing simulation..."". This implies that the problem isn't with any constructors (eg the `Field` constructor above) but rather the actual computations, probably. A big change from 0.85 (which [occurred in 0.88](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/releases/tag/v0.88.0)) is the [introduction of the `KernelParameters` abstraction](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3125) for offsetting indices within kernels, used here:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/70536571523ad2eb71fd9a2200121eca63998ac4/src/AbstractOperations/computed_field.jl#L78. and I think other places, which @simone-silvestri can advise. `KernelParameters` extends some `KernelAbstractions` functionality in a non-trivial way I think. Maybe there are some things we can improve there:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/main/src/Utils/kernel_launching.jl. Even if the issue is fixed on 1.10, I think we still ought to understand this problem better since it might come back in the future (things like this often do...)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3381#issuecomment-1808580651:397,release,releases,397,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3381#issuecomment-1808580651,1,['release'],['releases']
Deployability,"That could work --- though I'd point out that listing the model components that can be inconsistent with one another might be more explicit. I would advocate for a ""blacklisting"" method whereby blacklisted combinations of components are listed local to the implementation of the component. For example, in `beta_plane.jl` we could add. ```julia; validate_coriolis(::BetaPlane, ::AbstractGrid{FT, TX, <:Periodic}) where {FT, TX} = # error; ```. we also need, in `hydrostatic_spherical_coriolis.jl`,. ```julia; validate_coriolis(::HydrostaticSphericalCoriolis, ::AbstractRectilinearGrid) = # error; ```. I think a warning is better than an error for `WENO5` on a curvilinear grid. That'd be a fun scheme to experiment with and we don't know ""how wrong"" it is. If the curvilinear grid is almost regular, we have reason to think it might work. In cases like these where we aren't completely, rock-solid positive that a certain model configuration is invalid I think we should also err conservative and allow such models to be constructed. . We do need to strike a balance between being helicopter parents to users, and catching common mistakes. I don't think we should get in the business of curating science --- we should just provide useful software. Specialty applications can just avoid the kwarg-based constructor so I'm not sure we should worry much about that.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1453#issuecomment-796814847:929,configurat,configuration,929,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1453#issuecomment-796814847,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"That's right. Purely for simplicity we launch all the tendency kernels from 1:N, though for Face-fields in Bounded directions, we only require 2:N. In fact using tendencies only from 2:N could allow an optimization where we don't need to ""enforce"" no-penetration boundary conditions. It'd be hard to achieve this optimization though because users can write things like `parent(u) .= 1` so I'm not sure we can get away with this being guaranteed correct. This has never been a problem because we simply overwrite the boundary velocity and therefore simply discard the tendency at index 1. > The problem is if we try to integrate something like a radiation condition. Can you point me to where in the code this goes down?. > On bounded topology I don't think we ever want to integrate the tendency right? But it might be more complicated to do that. I think that's right that we don't need the tendency. This has been part of the algorithm since time immemorial and back in the mists of time it was indeed more complicated than worthwhile. The complication is that KernelAbstractions assumes indices start at 1... However, we now have a way of offsetting indices in kernels via our `KernelParameters`. So it's not very hard to do this anymore. I can give it a start. If we make this change, we also want to take a step back and look at all the kernels we are launching currently to make sure everything makes sense. For example, here is a question: while we don't want to integrate the velocity tendencies on boundaries, what do we do about diagnostics? Do we want to compute vorticity on the boundary, for example, if we are computing a vorticity diagnostic? It seems simpler if we don't, that way we don't have special cases...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3810#issuecomment-2388758985:618,integrat,integrate,618,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3810#issuecomment-2388758985,6,['integrat'],['integrate']

Deployability,"The way I implemented it, the matrix ""constructors"" are saved in the solver without the variable diagonal term. Basically the constructors include all the terms except for the term that varies with the time step which is saved in `solver.diagonal`. ; i.e. the `Dᵢⱼₖ` in; ```; Axᵢ₊₁ ηᵢ₊₁ + Axᵢ ηᵢ₋₁ + Ayⱼ₊₁ ηⱼ₊₁ + Ayⱼ ηⱼ₋₁ + Azₖ₊₁ ηₖ₊₁ + Azₖ ηⱼ₋₁ ; - 2 ( Axᵢ₊₁ + Axᵢ + Ayⱼ₊₁ + Ayⱼ + Azₖ₊₁ + Azₖ ) ηᵢⱼₖ ; + ( Cᵢⱼₖ + Dᵢⱼₖ/Δt^2 ) ηᵢⱼₖ = b; ```. Every time that the time step changes this is the operation that is performed:; ```; constructors = deepcopy(solver.matrix_constructors); M = prod(solver.problem_size); update_diag!(constructors, arch, M, M, solver.diagonal, Δt, 0); solver.matrix = arch_sparse_matrix(arch, constructors) ; ```. So the matrix is constructed from a copy of the updated constructors. In this way there is no need to subtract anything to the diagonal because `solver.matrix_constructors` does not include the diagonal term. . `update_diag!` adds `Dᵢⱼₖ/Δt^2` to the diagonal elements. . If you want to do the something analogous with the linear operation, remove the time dependent term from it. Then add it separately with `update_diag!` every time the time step changes. Of course you want to make sure that you have elements in your diagonal, non trivial if `Cᵢⱼₖ` because a sparse matrix removes 0 elements. check out this function ; `ensure_diagonal_elements_are_present!(sparse_matrix)`",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2396#issuecomment-1179415403:784,update,updated,784,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2396#issuecomment-1179415403,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"Thinking about this more, I think it would make sense to make an even more radical change. I think we should add `diagnostics`, `output_writers`, and `clock` to `Simulation`. . The `time_step!` function then performs a single time-step, whereas to run a simulation one should write `run!(simulation)`, which handles diagnostics, output writing, adaptive time-stepping, and logging in an integrated way. This orthogonalizes the design a bit: `diagnostics` and `output_writers` are not really aspects of a ""model"", if we use a narrow interpretation of a model as a discrete representation of a physical system. A single physical system might conceivably be associated with a wide range of disparate diagnostics and output, depending on what kind of science is being done. I think scripts become clearer. The user writes. ```julia; model = Model(; model_parameters...). simulation = Simulation(model; simulation_parameters...). simulation.diagnostics[:diag] = # something. run!(simulation); ```. As an example to illustrate why `Simulation` is orthogonal to `Model`, here's a possible clear and coherent usage of this separation:. ```julia; model = Model(; model_parameters...). set!(model; first_interesting_initial_condition...). first_simulation = Simulation(model, first_simulation_parameters...); first_simulation[:diag] = diag_specific_to_first_simulation; run!(first_simulation). set!(model; second_interesting_initial_condition...) # same physical model, but different starting initial condition... no new memory allocated, no recompilation --- fast. second_simulation = Simulation(model, second_simulation_parameters...); second_simulation[:diag] = diag_specific_to_second_simulation; run!(second_simulation); ```.

Deployability,"To clarify: I think there is utility in a simple example. However, I also recommend using a streamfunction for idealized cases, since its easier to reproduce and understand. Idealized cases with simple geostrophic flows include experiments like the Eady turbulence problem, or LES cases that simulate turbulence in the presence of a simple geostrophic flow. Another class of experiments (likely more prevalent and important than LES around geostrophic flows?) are realistic / quasi-realistic simulations on the sphere initialized from data or complicated buoyancy distributions. For these it's often important to find a flow field that's in _discrete_ geostrophic balance with an arbitrary buoyancy field. We can show how to integrate the buoyancy field for this purpose; but having `IntegratedField` implemented will make it a bit cleaner. The problem of finding a streamfunction from a velocity field is likewise be important for simulations on the cubed sphere; or cases in which the grid coordinate system does not align with, for example, a geographic coordinate system. This is the case that @francispoulin was attempting to solve in #1826, I think. @navidcy may illustrate how to do this in post processing using the conjugate gradient solver in his horizontal convection example, perhaps.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1846#issuecomment-877651839:725,integrat,integrate,725,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1846#issuecomment-877651839,3,"['Integrat', 'integrat']","['IntegratedField', 'integrate']"

Deployability,"To summarize what I think is happening: the immersed boundary is working essentially as expected in that the immersed boundary ""appears"" like a solid wall in visualization and qualitative inspection of the solution. However, small errors in both the pressure gradient and the boundary condition accumulate over the course of the simulation. The result is a realistic looking simulation with an immersed boundaries whose nonlinear trajectory gradually but persistently deviates _point-by-point_ from the ""true"" solution. We should also check the tracer budget. I expect that the tracer is not conserved due to leakage through the boundary. There is some subtlety in the implementation of the masking. Here, we only mask the _predictor velocity field_, prior to the pressure correction step. This ensures that the velocity field which is used to calculate tendency terms is divergence-free to machine precision. However, this also means that the impenetrable boundary condition is not satisfied exactly, because there is an unbalanced pressure gradient across the boundary. As a result, tracer ""leaks"" across the boundary. An alternative implementation might mask the velocity field both prior to the correction step, and when the auxiliary state is updated (as is done for `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` and `ShallowWaterModel`). But this is not a cure for tracer conservation because the flux form advection schemes we use assume that the velocity field is divergence free. The upshot is that we cannot achieve tracer conservation (or momentum conservation) with immersed boundaries unless we modify the pressure solver. An easy thing to try is to use the `PreconditionedConjugateGradientSolver` to ""polish off"" the pressure field obtained from the FFT based solver such that a correct pressure field + divergence free velocity field is obtained.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1733#issuecomment-855109309:1248,update,updated,1248,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1733#issuecomment-855109309,1,['update'],['updated']

This requires defining `fill_halo_west_east`, `fill_halo_north_south` and `top_bottom` for tuples. This said on a fairly large grid (`512²×30`) I get an efficiency of 78% going from 1 to 2 GPUs.

Deployability,"Upon thinking about it I think perhaps it makes more sense to run `dynamics` first before `advect_lagrangian_particles!`, one example of which might be that particles sink depending on the radius of the particle, which changes with time. In such a case it is perhaps better to evolve the particle radius, then compute the sinking velocity given the new radius before advective it. Also provided a draft example of how one could set up a problem where the particle sinks with a drag in the form of $\frac{d \boldsymbol{v}}{dt} = \frac{C_d}{\tau}(\boldsymbol{u} - \boldsymbol{v})$. ; Note: in the calculation the velocity of the particle itself needs to be tracked. This is done in `u_particle`, `v_particle`, and `w_particle` in `particles.properties` where `particles::LagrangianParticles`. The particle velocities are computed and updated in the `dynamics` step, then `ParticleVelocities` only has functions that access the particle properties to grab the particle velocity. It is slightly clunky but unless we keep track of the particle velocities right out of the box and update them during the `advect_lagrangian_particles!` step, this is the way I could think of. Since particle velocities are not updated when the particle is bounced, it will not work if the particles bounce from the boundaries back into the interior during the advection step, but for doubly-periodic domian and sinking particles it might not be very important.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3396#issuecomment-1872156350:832,update,updated,832,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3396#issuecomment-1872156350,3,['update'],"['update', 'updated']"

Deployability,"Very sorry for the problems that you found but I'm glad you found them. I believe when @ali-ramadhan and I put this together we were following other examples but I definitely should have been more careful. Just so that I understand, instead of having `momentum_flux_huu, advection` and `transport_tracer_flux_x` we should have had something involving the area? I'm happy to help fix this where I can. As for computing the velocity, I hope we can fix that soon as well. I know that `ShallowWaterModel` is a bit odd as we integrate the mass transports, not the velocities, but we do use the velocity a lot. I wonder if it's worth while computing the velocities (correctly) and then storing those. That should certainly help when we add in `closure` schemes, since those should be based on the velocities, for the most part. One option would be to add `model.velocities,u` and something similar for `v`, and then access them when we need them. That has the unfortuante effect of storing 5 instead of 3 fields, so it would make things more memory intensive.

Although I have no idea how close we are to that goal. > I think the main downside of a separate package is that we have to maintain two CI pipelines, two docs, etc. My idea about separating the Poisson solvers specifically was mainly motivated by my perception that that part of code the changes very rarely compared to the other parts.

Deployability,"We need an MPI tips / wiki section... been working on getting distributed simulations running on Engaging since yesterday (we need people to be able to start running distributed simulations immediately with minimal start up time). Here are a few things I learned:. * Remember to load a system MPI on your HPC, eg `module load openmpi`; * MPI may have to be installed / configured carefully --- after loading a system MPI. `MPIPreferences` can help:. ```julia; using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(); ```. https://juliaparallel.org/MPI.jl/stable/configuration/. * Configuring SLURM correctly may also require some trial and error, because the documentation is unclear and there are a huge number of options. I can't figure out if the documentation is wrong, in fact, or if instead the engaging cluster does not support some options. Either way, a small test script like. ```julia; using MPI. MPI.Init(); @show MPI.Comm_rank(MPI.COMM_WORLD); @show MPI.Comm_size(MPI.COMM_WORLD); ```. Is helpful for debugging. Also, I recommend first trying to start jobs interactively before using `sbatch`. Interactive jobs launch faster, so we get a faster trial-error iteration. I'm still working on things, but it seems like another point may be salient:. * Initialize / precompile outside of a parallel job before trying to launch a parallel job via `mpiexec`. Here are some notes that may be specific to engaging:. I'm using `srun` to get a 4-GPU node to use interactively:. ```; srun -p my_partition --tasks-per-node=4 --cpus-per-task=32 --gres=gpu:4 --gpus-per-node=4 --mem=0 -t 01:00:00 -N 1; ```. it seems we have to use the option `gpus-per-node`, rather than setting the total number of GPUs. Also we redundantly also have to specify `gres=gpu:4` (`gres` stands for ""generalized resource""). Why `gres` can't tell what `gpus-per-node` is, I don't know. `-N 1` means 1 node. Finally we also have to specify ``--tasks-per-node=4` (matching `gres` _and_ the number of GPUs per node), otherwise",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3698#issuecomment-2389107436:357,install,installed,357,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3698#issuecomment-2389107436,4,"['configurat', 'install']","['configuration', 'installed']"

Deployability,"We should have a way to mask the tracers for sure.

For this reason, we don't need to mask the tracer within the time integration.

Deployability,"Well, right now, the `Model` includes both discrete and continuous aspects of the PDE. `Model` also stores `architecture`, for example, which is unrelated to the PDE. We did consider an abstraction that represented the equation set independent from discretization. This would not be a replacement for model, but would simply be a way to organize some of the properties of model (eg buoyancy, coriolis, diffusion, etc). Yet this is a challenging abstraction to design. One issue is specification. If we try to separate the terms from their numerical implementation, we have to figure how to distinguish between ""diffusion with second-order differences"" and ""diffusion with fourth-order differences"". It's clearly possible to do this, but it's going to take some time and careful thought to implement. We've taken a more incremental approach to development the model instead, resulting in a fairly ""flat"" interface to `IncompressibleModel` that combines aspects both of the continuous equations, their discretization, and things like `architecture`, the `pressure_solver`, etc. I think flat is simple (think parameter files as the platonic ideal of a flat API); however, we still want to benefit from modularity where it's a simple change that doesn't overcomplicate the interface (hence this issue).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1175#issuecomment-729123548:56,continuous,continuous,56,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1175#issuecomment-729123548,2,['continuous'],['continuous']

Deployability,"What is the intent of these tests? Are they intended to be included in CI, or are they more in the style of “benchmarks” that are run relatively infrequently?. @edoddridge A twist on option 1 is to design a forcing that exactly cancels the terms associated with nonlinear and linear terms in a given equation for some simple initial condition consisting of sines and cosines. For example, pick an initial condition, calculate all terms in a given equation, and then write a forcing that exactly cancels those terms. Then check that the initial condition doesn’t change after a few time-steps. This method allows a test at low resolution with low computational burden and allows each nonlinear and linear term in each equation to be assessed separately. . It would also be good to run “benchmarks” that are designed to be run less frequently, which is a category I think some of the suggested tests fall into (?)

I guess they're not as commonly used as `ContinuousForcing`.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1642#issuecomment-836886632:138,Continuous,ContinuousForcing,138,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1642#issuecomment-836886632,1,['Continuous'],['ContinuousForcing']
Deployability,"Yeah okay, both of those suggestions make sense and adding a line in update state is probably the most general solution too. Once I've cleaned up a bit I guess the only the last we would need to settle on for the simplest case is how we specify the form of $\phi^{n+1}$ (and how I've written the fill_bulk_outflow_halo file). Currently, it is hardcoded that it is upwinded when there is an outflow and relaxed to an external solution when it inflows as:. `(1 - Ūᵇ - 1/τ̄) * ϕⁿ + Ūᵇ * ϕᵢ₋₁ + ϕᵉ / τ̄`,. where $0 < U^b < 1 $, but conceivably it could be something along the lines of unwinding both ways like:. `(1 - Ūᵇ) * ϕⁿ + max(0, Ūᵇ) * ϕᵢ₋₁ - min(0, Ūᵇ) * ϕᵉ`. Perhaps if we change to:; ```julia; struct BulkOutflow{IS, OS} <: AbstractBoundaryConditionClassification; inflow_speed :: IS; outflow_speed :: OS; end; ```; then we can make it the general form:. $\phi^{n+1} _i = (1 - U_i - U_o) \phi^n + U_i \phi^e + U_o \phi^n _{i-1}$. with $0 < U_i, U_o < 1$ and only $U_i$ or $U_o$ can be non-zero.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3482#issuecomment-1978821684:69,update,update,69,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3482#issuecomment-1978821684,2,['update'],['update']
Deployability,Yeah only a few more fixes!. CUDA.jl 3.0 only supports Julia 1.6+ and the next release of KernelAbstractions.jl should switch to CUDA.jl 3.0 so if this PR is open for a bit longer we might as well bump Oceananigans.jl to only support Julia 1.6 as well.

Deployability,"Yeah that would definitely help with modularization. They might need to take in the whole model, e.g. `validate_coriolis(model)`, `validate_advection(model)`, etc. since it seems hard to anticipate all the inconsistent configurations.

Deployability,"Yeah this has always been an issue on my local setup and at some point Plots.jl/GR.jl stopped working haha (I'm probably missing some library) so I fully switched to CairoMakie.jl. We use `ENV[""GKSwstype""]=""nul""` in CI for this reason. It could be good to add to the examples so users don't encounter this issue but it's been a long-standing issue in Plots.jl/GR.jl (https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl/issues/1649) but the solution seems to involve installing extra libraries (https://gr-framework.org/julia.html#installation) which gets somewhat user unfriendly...

Deployability,"Yeah, I think we can overlap a bit. I think the benefit of providing a link is because as Julia's instructions get better, we benefit for free. If we write a long essay about installing Julia, our users might miss out on those improvements elsewhere. Plus, we have to maintain it as things change, which creates work for us.

Deployability,"Yeah, this is confusing. @navidcy updated the docs so that `\vec v = (u, v, w)` is three-dimensional, while `\vec u = (u, v)` is two-dimensional. Right now, we only support two-dimensional Stokes drift, so two-dimensionalization would be fine. In the future it's in principle possible to support Stokes drift with a vertical component, but there are some details regarding divergent Stokes drift fields / divergent Lagrangian-mean velocity fields that would have to be considered. Because of the complications of 3D Stokes drift maybe it's best to explicitly state that the Stokes drift is 2D (and use `\vec u^S`?)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2007#issuecomment-941336434:34,update,updated,34,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2007#issuecomment-941336434,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"Yes we definitely need to speed up the tests. I think 95% of the time it takes to run tests is spent in compilation, however, so creating fewer models may not help much. Instead we may need to be more strategic with how we run tests, and perhaps also work on speeding up compilation time using something like [SnoopCompile.jl](https://github.com/timholy/SnoopCompile.jl). On #1962 we add bars capability, which will allow us to separate the tests into a few categories: fast-running, crucial tests will run on every commit to a PR, and slower, more comprehensive integration tests will run only when `bors try` or `bors r+` is invoked. This might help streamline the development workflow. Also if we are using Caltech's central cluster for CI we can potentially split the jobs amongst more workers, which might help speed up tests overall. Even more important is simplifying the test implementation. Right now updating tests and validation experiments is a time sink for developers that change the API and has really slowed development down lately. So we shouldn't rewrite tests in a way that makes development more difficult (eg keeping the maintenance burden of the test infrastructure small is more important than decreasing the computational cost of tests). This is really a side comment --- we should be able to improve the tests both so they are faster _and_ easier to maintain, if we are careful.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1990#issuecomment-922526970:563,integrat,integration,563,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1990#issuecomment-922526970,2,['integrat'],['integration']
