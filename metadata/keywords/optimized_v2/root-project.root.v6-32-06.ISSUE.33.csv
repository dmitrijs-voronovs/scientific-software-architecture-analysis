Integrability,"For our users, it's important to fix certain parameters in the likelihood easily with any overhead. So far, this didn't work when using gradients from AD, because the gradients were only produced for the parameters that are floating at the time where the likelihood is created. However, it has no additional runtime overhead in backwards AD mode to simply generate the gradient for **all** parameters, and then filter out the right elements in the the RooMinimizer-related code. This is what is implemented in the second commit of this PR. Some changes in the RooAbsMinimizerFcn were necessary to do this filtering: so far it didn't store any information on all the parameters in order. It only stored two separate lists for floating and constant parameters. The first commit in this PR adds the necessary data members (`_allParams` and `_allParamsInit`) to the RooAbsMinimizerFcn for the filtering of parameters. Furthermore, the previous datamembers that stored the parameters separately are removed to avoid duplication and possible desync of information. On this occasion, the parameter management was completely rewritten to be more concise and robust. This will also help later when we integrate the discrete profiling from CMS combine, where changing the state and filtering of minimization parameters is also relevant. It was validated with the ATLAS and CMS likelihoods from ICHEP 2024 that this PR results in no performance regression, even though we are now generating the gradient for more parameters (roughly up to two times more, because for every floating nuisance parameter there is usually one constant global observable that constrains it).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16750:1192,integrat,integrate,1192,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16750,1,['integrat'],['integrate']

Integrability,"For the new RooFit BatchMode, the model pdf had to be ""compiled"" for a; fixed normalization set before being evaluated by the RooFit driver. This step was implemented in a rather hacky way, because it only became; clear gradually how important this step is, as many changes need to be; done to the computation graph before it can be used by the BatchMode. It started by ""unrolling"" the normalization integrals such that they are; separate nodes that can be evaluated by the RooFit driver. Then, it also covered the transformation of every RooProdPdf into a new; object that exposes the full intenal computation graph that is cached by; the RooProdPdf for a given norm set. These two changes where done in separate passes through the compute; graph, and there was also a third pass to figure out dependencies and; normalization sets in the graph, and some more recursive passes the; attach new servers. This all became very compilcated and hard to debug, as the separate; passes through the graph interfered with each other as well.

This guarantees that if CMSSW has N output modules, there will be at most N queued merge operations and while the merge are going on only 1 thread is used for it (and the other N-1 can be used for other CMSSW work). e) We need to implement a queuing of the merge operations tasks without relying on the ROOT global write lock.

Integrability,"Good job, @j-mathe! All the changes of the tutorial look reasonable to me. Small remarks regarding naming conventions:; 1. PRs would usually trigger several machines to build ROOT on them and run all the ROOT tests on them (CI). Since the changes are only on comments, you should start the name of your PR/commit as `[skip-ci]`. This would prevent these machines from building/testing.; 2. Since the changes are very closely related to RDataFrame, it is advisable to specify in the name of the commit `[DF]`. So I would suggest a better name for your commit to be `[skip-ci][DF] Fix typos and grammar mistakes in df002 tutorials`. I changed the name of the PR to that.

Integrability,"Great regarding the 6.24. As for the interface, there are Unuran methods (HINV and NINV) that do not require PDF, only CDF. This is why I proposed a constructor which only sets the `fOwnFunc` and let all 3 xxDF functions be optional. I see there is a ctor accepting TF1 pointers that can be used in this case, but it sets unconditionally the `fOwnFunc`. With that in mind, my proposed ctor has to be:; ```cpp; TUnuranContDist(bool copyFunc);; ```; i.e. without a default value for copyFunc. So for the case when the user wants only CDF and not to copy it in TUnuranContDist, a new ctor or a method to set `fOwnFunc` is needed anyway. For the case where the user wants to set all 3 xxDF functions indeed the ctor is there, my point is just that the user code looks a bit ugly:; ```cpp; TUnuranContDist dist(pdf, &dpdf, false, true);; dist.SetCdf(cdf);; ```; compared to:; ```cpp; TUnuranContDist dist(pdf, dpdf, cdf, false, true);; ```; or:; ```cpp; TUnuranContDist dist(true);; dist.SetPdf(pdf);; dist.SetDpdf(dpdf);; dist.SetCdf(cdf);; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8196#issuecomment-849392582:37,interface,interface,37,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8196#issuecomment-849392582,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"HI Rahul, thanks for the PR! Here is what I would do to get started with the missing bullet points:. 1. added tutorials. A tutorial that showcases the Taylor expansion feature is definitely welcome! I would show the 1D case, where you Taylor expand let's say a 4th degree polynomial at different orders and plot the Taylor expansions together with the original Polynomial. At 4th order, the Taylor expansion should match with the original. 2. added unit test. For sure we need a unit test for these new features. It's always good to start with some closure tests:; * check that a one dimensional RooPolyFunc wrapped in a PDF behaves the same as a RooPolynomial; * check that the Taylor expansion of a 2nd order 1D RooPolyFunc at 2nd order matches the original Polynomial; * same check as in the provious bullet point, but n-dimensional case (2D is enough). 3. analytical integral. Let's deal with this later, I still need to think more about this. We should start with the unit tests anyway. Let me know on Mattermost if you need any help with the unit tests or tutorials!

Integrability,"Hello @Harshalzzzzzzz ,; basically what the description says: currently, if you construct a `TFile` directly (i.e. not going through the factory function `TFile::Open`) the constructor errors out if some protocol must be used to access the file (e.g. `root://` or `http://`) -- like in the first example in the description. The reason why this does not work is not very important, the point is that `TFile(""root://..."")` fails and the right thing to do instead is `TFile::Open(""root://..."")`. So if the TFile constructor fails with that ""file ... does not exist"" error, _before_ printing that error we want to check whether the filename contains `""://""` and if it does we want to print a _different_ error message that does not say ""file ... does not exist"" but instead it points users to using ""TFile::Open"" instead (as in the issue description).

Integrability,"Hello @hcmidt, discussed a bit with my colleagues about what we'd need to do in this PR to set a good precedent for the RooFit pythonizations. 1. We should better stick with the `CamelCase` instead casting to of `lower_case` with underscore. True, it's less pythonic, but it would also mean we'd have to duplicate the documentation for pyROOT with the new parameter names. If we keep the same argument names as in C++, the C++ documentation is still useful.; 2. Please extend your test such that it covers also the case where one mixes the C++-style arguments with the keyword arguments, e.g. `fitTo(self.data, Range=""sideband"", ROOT.RooFit.Save=True)`; 3. Rename the `test/rooabspdf` directory you created to `test/roofit`, otherwise it's a bit too granular; 4. Create also a `_roofit` subdirectory directory in the `ROOT/pythonization` directory where you put your `_rooabspdf.py ` file. The underscore at the beginning is to mark that this is not part of the ""public"" interface. I suppose you also need to create a new `__init__.py` file in the same directory. That would be enough for this PR I think. Here are some thoughts on what to do as we proceed (of course you can do some of it also in this PR if you like). We probably will have some common helper classes for RooFit pythonizations at some point, as there are reoccurring patterns, like the `RooCmdArg` pattern you saw in [`fitTo`](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooAbsPdf.html#a8f802a3a93467d5b7b089e3ccaec0fa8). Then, I'd suggest to we don't create a new `@pythonization()` function every RooFit class we pythonize in the future, because that would mean to pattern-match all class names one after the other. Maybe we can have a single `@pythonization()` in `ROOT/pythonization/_roofit/__init__.py` that checks if the class has a name starting with `Roo`. If it does, it will call all the roofit pythonization functions that we create. As we add more pythonizations, we probably have to add some doxygen text if the pythonized inte",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7314#issuecomment-790082105:971,interface,interface,971,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7314#issuecomment-790082105,1,['interface'],['interface']

I can do the fit with as pdf : model_had1A = RooProdPdf (fsb_had1A, constbias_had1A) where; fsb = ns x fs + nb x fb, fs and fb are signal and background pdf, ns contains the poi, nb is free floating. It runs; smoothly even if we are close to the unphysical region (poi < 0). (Probably many error messages from the exploration of the unphysical region have been removed from the output.); I can also try a fit with the pdf : simPdf = RooSimultaneous (indexCat=had1A, had1A=model_had1A) : this is virtually the same pdf, but this time embeded in a RooSimultaneous object. The fit fails. Between the two root versions, one things that appeared weird to me is that fsb_had1A does not seem to be; normalized when embeded in the RooSimultaneous in root 6.24.00. Maybe that is fine, but this is different from; what I see in root 6.22.02. ### Expected behavior; I would expect exactly the same results in both fits, with a best fit poi = 0 and a reasonable uncertainty.; This is what I see in root-6.22.02. In root 6.24.00 the fit with a RooSimultaneous fails. . ### To Reproduce; I put the code here /afs/cern.ch/user/j/jdevivi/public/ISSUEROOFIT. In root-6.24.00, I just do ; root.exe testWSsimulvsprod.C. In root-6.22.02, I do; root.exe load.C testWSsimulvsprod.C; since I use a RooCrystalBall from root-6.24 and did not put the code in the workspace.

Integrability,"Here is a relevant [issue](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/17735) where this is discussed more in depth. One of the [comments](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/17735#note_487572) in this issue explains the rationale behind overriding `find_package` quite well. If there is a better solution that can work the way the current solution does (i.e. works also for LLVM without having to change its calls to `find_package(ZLIB)`, for example), we can implement it. However, so far I have not found a another way to do it. Maybe now that the required version of CMake is newer than 3.11, we may be able to improve things by using the [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html) module. It may also be possible to use [CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_\<PackageName\>](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.10/variable/CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_PackageName.html) to skip checking for packages if that doesn't force packages to be considered not found when `<PackageName_FOUND>` is then also set by hand. The reality, though, is that CMake still kinda sucks for managing optionally bundled dependencies like ROOT wants to support. As for the undocumented nature of the feature, it's sad but, like the [CDash test measurements](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/ctest_test.html?#additional-test-measurements) that were undocumented for a long time, if you offer it, people will try to use it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8633#issuecomment-898406007:1127,depend,dependencies,1127,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8633#issuecomment-898406007,2,['depend'],['dependencies']
Integrability,"Here is a suggestion for a class to input and output JSON data. It is _not_ meant for (`T`)object serialisation (there's `TBufferJSON` for that) - but for use cases where one wants to import or export JSON data into ROOT-based code. Examples could be . - Input and output of HEPData data. For example, one may want to read in some table via JSON and visualize, or one has produced a result one wants to upload to HEPData ; - Interoperability with Python. Python has support for many data format - not least JSON. . The attached class `TJSON` allows for this in a relatively straight forward manner. For example, one can do . ```c++; TJSON null;; TJSON b(true);; TJSON s(""RawString"");; TJSON s2(std::string(""C++String""));; TJSON i(42);; TJSON f(3.14);; TJSON a = TJSON::Array();; TJSON o = TJSON::Object();; ```; for null, boolean, string, numbers (int and float), arrays or objects (associative container). . A more complex object can be created like . ```c++ ; TJSON o2 = std::map<std::string,TJSON>{; {""key1"",""value""},; {""key2"",true},; {""key3"",; {""key4"", TJSON::Array(""This"",""is"",""an"",""array""),; ""key5"",; {""boolean"", true}; }; }; };; ```. and elements are accessed via `operator[]` . ```c++; assert o2[""key1""] == ""value"";; assert o2[""key3""][""key4""][1] == ""is""; ```. One can loop over arrays or objects via `TJSON::ArrayRange` or `TJSON::ObjectRange` respectively. . ```c++; TJSON a = TJSON::Array();; TJSON o = TJSON::Object();. for (size_t i = 0; i < 4; i++); a[i] = ""Test""+std::to_string(i);. o[""key0""] = ""value1"";; o[""key1""] = a;; o[""key2""] = 123;. std::cout << ""Array: "" << std::endl;; for (auto& e : a.ArrayRange()); std::cout << e << std::endl;. std::cout << ""Object: "" << std::endl;; for (auto& kv : o.ObjectRange()); std::cout << ""o["" << kv.first << ""] = "" << kv.second << std::endl;; ```. JSON can be read and written to streams . ```c++; std::cout << ""=== Loading ==="" << std::endl;; std::string s(""{\""key1\"":\""string\"",""; 		"" \""key2\"": true,""; 		"" \""key3\"": 1234,""; 		"" \""key4\"":null}"");.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6889:425,Interoperab,Interoperability,425,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6889,1,['Interoperab'],['Interoperability']

Integrability,"Here's an explanation that at least satisfies me: I added a `module->dump();` to `IncrementalJIT::addModule()` so that I can see what code is handed over to LLVM when just starting `./bin/root -q -l`. My understanding is that this comes from the dicts that are loaded on startup. Looking for `GetPoolSize`, here's the relevant part of the LLVM IR:; ```llvm; ; Function Attrs: noinline uwtable; define i32 @_ZNK4ROOT8Internal9TExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::Internal::TExecutor""*) #0 align 2 {; ; contains calls to; %seq = call i32 @_ZNK4ROOT19TSequentialExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::TSequentialExecutor""* %9); %thread = call i32 @_ZNK4ROOT15TThreadExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::TThreadExecutor""* %13); %process = call i32 @_ZNK4ROOT16TProcessExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::TProcessExecutor""* %17); }. ; Function Attrs: noinline nounwind uwtable; define linkonce_odr i32 @_ZNK4ROOT19TSequentialExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::TSequentialExecutor""*) #1 comdat align 2 {; ; ...; }. declare i32 @_ZNK4ROOT15TThreadExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::TThreadExecutor""*) #2; ```. So the dict contains the definition of `Executor::GetPoolSize()`, which is not `inline`, and references `TThreadExecutor::GetPoolSize()` defined in `libImt.so`, but obviously not in the dict. This symbol remains unresolved during JIT, leading to the error message we're seeing. Notice that `TSequentialExecutor::GetPoolSize()` is `linkonce_odr` due to being `inline`. When adding the `inline` keyword to `TExecutor::GetPoolSize()` (thanks Philippe for the less intrusive proposal), all these functions disappear from the loaded `llvm::Module` because unused `linkonce_odr` are dropped (recursively) before passing to JIT. So in essence I think this is not about symbols not being exported or inlined by the compiler, but what we need is the semantics of `inline` that the function can be dropped from the `llvm::Module`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7033#issuecomment-760022478:1369,message,message,1369,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7033#issuecomment-760022478,1,['message'],['message']

In coffea, we didn't go all the way to formalizing it in a schema since there are many details but you can see the basic validation we do here:; https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea/blob/master/coffea/processor/executor.py#L1353; We allow forms like:; ```; fileset = { ""dataset"" : [""some"", ""list"", ""of"", ""files""], ...}; # and; fileset = { ""dataset"": { ""files"": [""file1"", ""file2"", ...], ""treename"": ""Events"", ""metadata"": { ""stuff"": ""about stuff""}, ...}, { .... } }; ```; depending on user need.; I think optional and union types are very convenient here since not every user will need or want to specify all components of the full schema on each use (but uniformizing the description when needed is very important). .

Integrability,"Hi @Axel-Naumann ,. >IEEE 754 brings defined behavior to ""degenerate"" (not in the IEEE 754 sense) cases. That is true. But does not help practically.

Or, even worse, produces a result that looks fine but is incorrect and then user (e.g. me) will spend some days to understand where the problem is. > as the optimizer might change fp operations. Yes, GCC tries to keep them ""fp-safe"" but that might change in any of the upcoming versions.

This is not meant for merging, we are fine with an out of tree patch for now, but we would of course be very happy if something like this becomes upstream eventually. This is a very ""hacky"" try to be able to create ROOT files with; deterministic checksum that is not dependent on timestamp or hostname or; anything: Create a file with the same content twice on different; machines should yield the same checksum (assuming they have the same root file format version and same class definitions ...). We cannot really modify the software using these checksums and it's not just ROOT files but also other files in there so a distinction between ""content checksum"" and ""file checksum"" would be rather tricky. That's why we went for the brutal approach. We need this mostly for small files in a well controlled environment:; The file is created in one place at one time and not incrementally over; a long time, no threads. . So we would be fine with a global flag to not store time dependent information in files but it is of course ugly.

Integrability,"Hi @Harshalzzzzzzz ,; ROOT has a high-level data analysis interface called [RDataFrame](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html), you can take a look at the docs and try reading and running some of the tutorials [here](https://root.cern/doc/master/group__tutorial__dataframe.html). `RDataFrame` returns results wrapped in the [RResultPtr](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDF_1_1RResultPtr.html) type, through which we implement lazy execution (data processing is triggered when a user accesses the contents of a `RResultPtr`, _not_ when they request the result). RResultPtr has interface and semantics similar to [std::shared_ptr](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr), but currently it's missing a way to release ownership of its contents. `RResultPtr<T>::Release` is a simple method that would mimic the semantics of `std::shared_ptr::release`: it must return a `T*` and empty the `RResultPtr`. What needs to be done concretely:. - [x] add the `RResultPtr::Release` method in RResultPtr.hxx. It should be implemented in terms of `fObjPtr.release()` and it should also set `fActionPtr` and `fLoopManager` to null; - [x] add tests for the feature in `tree/dataframe/test/dataframe_resptr.cxx`, in particular making sure that `Release` and the ResultPtr's move-constructor have consistent behavior; - [x] add logic to the current method `RResultPtr::GetValue` to throw an exception if it's called on a null `RResultPtr`.

It only technically seemed to work without error, but in fact the read-back RooNLLVars are corrupted and give wrong results when you read them back even for simple Gaussian cases, as I showed in the description of the linked PR. This and other reasons lead us to the decision to disallow the IO of `RooNLLVar` and other test statistics classes. From your warnings and error messages, it seems like you're trying to do IO of the RooNLLVar. Is there a way you can avoid this in your workflow? As I said it's not allowed anymore and in older ROOT versions it was not reliable. What people usually do is to save the pdf and the datasets in a RooWorkspace, and maybe a `ModelConfig` to simplify the NLL creation when reading back the data and pdf.

Integrability,"Hi @eguiraud and @Axel-Naumann,. Actually, this is an instance of vexing parse. Specifically, in the context where `bool(foo)` appears, it is parsed as a variable declaration with superfluous parenthesis, i.e. same as `bool foo`. Because definition shadowing is enabled, it replaces the old definition (of type `int`) and value-initializes it to `false`, which explains your first reported result.; Moreover, using `!!bool(foo)` disambiguates the input, which is now parsed as an expression and correctly prints `true`. The behavior seen in the second report is again due to vexing parse, and `bool(foo[0])` is parsed as the declaration `bool foo[0];`. Again, switching off definition shadowing gives:; ```; ROOT_prompt_3:1:6: error: redefinition of 'foo' with a different type: 'bool ([0]' vs 'const char *'; bool(foo[0]); ^; ROOT_prompt_1:1:13: note: previous definition is here; const char *foo = ""foo"";; ```; In this case, the output `(bool ([0]) @0x55c4ba66f180` is the address of the `bool [0]` object (whose size should be `1`). > Also note that the last example is missing a closing `)` for the type... Also, as can be seen above, the diagnostic message provided by Clang has one extra `(`, which I think should not be there. Now, what can we do about this? IMHO, while I think _that_ is the correct parsing, we should be probably issuing a warning. Any opinions on this? .

Integrability,"Hi @elusian, thank you so much as always for reporting this!. I haven't solved the problem yet, but just to track my progress here: the underlying problem is that the integrals of a derived PDF (like the `RooRealSumPdf` in your case) somehow have their client-server interface messed up. Here is a reproducer:. ```C++; void repro() {; using namespace RooFit;; RooRealVar x(""x"", """", 0, 1);. RooRealVar par(""par"", """", -0.005, -5, 5);; RooProduct parMod(""par_mod"", """", RooArgSet(par, RooConst(10)));. RooGaussian gauss(""gauss"", """", x, parMod, RooConst(2.0));; RooGenericPdf pdf(""pdf"", ""gauss"", gauss);. std::unique_ptr<RooAbsReal> integ1{gauss.createIntegral(x, *pdf.getIntegratorConfig(), nullptr)};; integ1->Print(""v"");. std::cout << std::endl;. std::unique_ptr<RooAbsReal> integ2{pdf.createIntegral(x, *pdf.getIntegratorConfig(), nullptr)};; integ2->Print(""v"");; }; ```. The integral of the Gaussian has the correct value (`V`) servers (the parameters of the Gaussian):; ```; (0x7ffc9b9bf798,-S) RooRealVar::x """"; (0x7ffc9b9bf240,--) RooGaussian::gauss """"; (0x7ffc9b9bff68,V-) RooProduct::par_mod """"; (0x55ac531cd470,V-) RooConstVar::2 ""2""; ```. The integral of the `RooGenericPdf` should have the same value servers, but it doesn't:; ```; (0x7ffc9b9bf798,-S) RooRealVar::x """"; (0x7ffc9b9bec88,--) RooRealSumPdf::pdf """"; (0x7ffc9b9bfb80,V-) RooRealVar::par """"; (0x55ac51984c50,V-) RooConstVar::10 ""10""; (0x55ac531cd470,V-) RooConstVar::2 ""2""; ```. For some reason, the direct value server, which is `par_mod` is **skipped** now, misrepresenting the client-server relationship. The new BatchMode makes strong use of the value-server interface for the `RooFitDriver`, so it's very sensitive to `RooRealIntegrals` getting it wrong. I need to fix this problem with the value servers registered for integrals on RooRealSumPdfs. Further notes:. * The problem has always been there in RooFit, it's just that the BatchMode uncovered it; * Naturally, the problem is somehow in `getValueAndShapeServers` in [Roo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11578#issuecomment-1281427464:267,interface,interface,267,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11578#issuecomment-1281427464,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"Hi @greenc-FNAL,. Thanks for this request. I will try to reply inline directly to some of the concerns and try to give some public-friendly outline the bigger picture as I see it. > Generated module files are compiler-specific, which would seem likely to lead to issues with interactions between Cling-generated PCM dictionaries and any C++20 modules used by the code upon which those dictionaries depend. I am not sure if that is the case at least for the next 10 years. I see this can be an issue if we start shipping module files (`bmi`s or equivalent) instead of header files. However, in practice that won't be the case in near future because the compiler vendors cannot agree on a common file format and make it standard. Until then, there will be always some sort of a textual header file which can be processed with our clang-based rootcling and build a pcm file as basis for our dictionaries. . > My request is for the upcoming ROOT with Clang 16 to be able to accommodate the generation and use of PCM dictionaries where dependencies thereof are or use C++20 modules. Clang has at least 5 different ""flavors"" of modules. One of them is the C++20 modules as described by the C++ standard. At the moment you start using C++ 20 you could use the `import`/`export` constructs and you will be able to use that feature for encapsulation purposes. There is not enough project transitions which are bigger than toy examples. One of the challenges is how we discover module dependencies. That is, we need extra tooling to decide how to split the source files into modules. In practice we need to pre-lex all of the content before the build system can start processing project files. The community is discussing scanners (such as clang scan-deps), daemons (the gcc implementation), protocols, etc. There is increasing amount of papers trying to address how we put C++ modules at scale (https://wg21.link/p2656, https://wg21.link/P2409, https://youtu.be/_LGR0U5Opdg?si=AbLazREvyl5PXVFG).

I addressed all of your comments, but for one comment I'm not sure if I made the right choice. My hesitation concerns the new member variables in `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` that relate to the batched mode: I don't know if they should take part in the IO or not. On one hand, I don't know why flags about how the test statistic is evaluated need to be stored. On the other hand, the `_batchEvaluations` flag that is currently in `RooNLLVar` and that this PR moves to `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` [is not excluded from the IO](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooNLLVar.h#L82). I guess you had a good reason for this choice, so I kept the new flags in `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` also for the IO. You think this is the right choice?.

Integrability,"Hi @henryiii, thanks for the contributions. I think that the tcmalloc space after the -L is something we need to fix. However, I'm not quite so sure about adding `ROOT::Flags` and `ROOT::Libraries`. These will be moving targets that may cause more trouble than they fix. We need to fix ROOT to only really pass required flags, not recommended flags. GeantV, for example, cannot compile against ROOT sometimes, because they inherit bad flags (think C++ standard). Also, `ROOT::Libraries` is quite generic and may or may not contain what the user needs, so if dependent projects use that rather than individual targets, they will certainly run into problems. However, for things like using `ROOT::RooFit` as convenience target already including `RooFitCore`, I think we should add the targets. With proper target dependencies, users will probably not need to list all targets, but only the ones used directly. So, if `ROOT::Math` requires `ROOT::Core`, that will be added automatically if you link against `ROOT::Math`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1959#issuecomment-387355022:558,depend,dependent,558,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1959#issuecomment-387355022,2,['depend'],"['dependencies', 'dependent']"

Integrability,"Hi @ynikitenko, thanks for the request! There are several reasons for not supporting PyPy. PyROOT, which is building on top of cppyy, is very deeply connected to the CPython implementation of CPyCppyy. Just like the CPython version of cppyy, PyROOT consists of a Python module and a compiled CPython extension (`libROOTPythonization`). And you can't use CPython extensions in PyPy. So to support PyPy, we would have to rewrite [all this code](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/bindings/pyroot/pythonizations/src), and work closely with the cppyy team to make sure it's PyPy implementation also provides the interfaces that PyROOT expects. That would be a *huge* amount of work with no usecase to justify it. And there are so many alternative of fast analysis frameworks that people are trying out right now: RDataFrame, NumPy, numba, awkward arrays, etc. And let's not forget that pypy has it's limitations! It only supports a restricted subset of Python, and it would require large efforts to port PyROOT to this. One final point: the future of PyPy development is not very clear. Right now, they don't support Python 3.11 yet, for example. Builds are only available for [Python 3.9 and Python 3.10](https://www.pypy.org/download_advanced.html). So investing in PyPy compatibility is also risky because of that. Imagine we would spend half a year trying to support it, and then PyPy would not be maintained anymore :(. I'll therefore close this issue as ""not planned"". tldr; the HEP community is gravitation towards other C++ native of jit-based Python packages to speed up analysis, and at this point investing in pypy is not worth it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8110#issuecomment-2148504771:622,interface,interfaces,622,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8110#issuecomment-2148504771,2,['interface'],['interfaces']

Behind the scene such stuff relies on serialization/deserialization of objects via `pickle` or `dill`; 2. explicitely where I store my data into custom `shelve`-like database, that relies on serialization of objects via pickling. - for (1) I do not know if I can properly inject ""import ROOT"" into the code flow at all vital occurances. ; - for (2) of course I can pre-import `ROOT` for all manipulations with custom database, but it is rather unnatural solution. E.g. opening a (originally `ROOT`-blind) database I need to know that it contains some `ROOT`-objects, and in this case use `import ROOT` before accessing objects from the database.

Integrability,"Hi Patrick, thanks a lot for these excellent developments! I will start the Jenkins tests to see if the CI can build it. To successfully integrate these developments, we should split the changes up into smaller PRs, as discussed in the RooFit weekly meeting. We could, for example, chunk it like this:. 1. First PR with changes to `math` only (`mathcore` and `minuit2`). Please ensure that no commit in this PR doesn't touch both math packages at the same time if not necessary. As far as I understood, the changes to `mathcore` and `minuit2` factorize, and you can make a commit for `mathcore` and then one or more for `minuit2`.; 2. Second PR with the new `roofit` packages `multiprocess` and `roofitZMQ`, again with separate commits for the individual packages. I guess you'd have to exclude the multiprocessing test that depends on roofit at that point, though. In this PR, we can also discuss in more detail how to manage the zero MQ dependency.; 3. Third PR with the rest, integrating the new `multiprocess` and `roofit/ZMQ` packages into RooFit. Feel free to split it up further if you think that's better. Some general things to consider in the new PRs:. * It seems unfeasible to rewrite the commit history in this PR to something that factorizes as proposed above. I guess you need to create new commits from the diff that only affect single packages.; * Please avoid mixing code formatting changes with actual changes in the same commit.; * Even better, avoid code formatting changes altogether. We want to eventually use a well-defined clang-format style (specified in [this file](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/.clang-format)), so changing the formatting in your PRs to something that is not compliant with the clang-format style is not meaningful.; * If your developments introduce new files (in particular the new `roofit` packages), please apply the ROOT clang-format style, so we don't have to touch these files again later just for the sake of reformatting.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8294#issuecomment-854587983:137,integrat,integrate,137,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8294#issuecomment-854587983,4,"['depend', 'integrat']","['dependency', 'depends', 'integrate', 'integrating']"
Integrability,"Hi Patrick, thanks for the explanation, things make more sense for me now! Interesting that you also experimented with making the full RooAbsMinimizer templated. I agree that making the RooAbsMinimizer a templated class is not the best solution, but I still think we can even avoid the templated constructor, making the code more clear and reducing compile time/binary size. You already have this nice `FcnMode` enum class which I think is great because enum class is typesafe while enum is not. Taking this enum, you could have a RooMinimizer constructor with the signature:; ```; RooMinimizer(RooAbsReal &function, FcnMode fcnMode);; ```; Then depending on `fcnMode`, you can create the correct function instance. You would not even have to check for the `logic_error`, because with the enum class is is ensured that the value is either `classic` or `gradient`. You would just need a little helper struct to make the `RooMinimizer::create()` function work, something to translate from the function class to the FcnMode:. ```C++; class RooMinimizer { ; ; ... ; private: ; ; template <typename MinimizerFcn ; struct GetFcnMode { ; static const FcnMode value = FcnMode::classic; ; }; ; ; ... ; ; } ; ; ; template<> ; struct RooMinimizer::GetFcnMode<RooGradMinimizerFcn> { ; static const FcnMode value = FcnMode::gradient; ; }; ; ; ; // static function ; template <typename MinimizerFcn> ; std::unique_ptr<RooMinimizer> RooMinimizer::create(RooAbsReal &function) { ; return std::make_unique<RooMinimizer>(function, GetFcnMode<MinimizerFcn>::value); ; } ; ```.

Integrability,"Hi Sergey, . The class `TJSON` is indeed similar to the library of _nlohmann_ except a whole lot more lean (_nlohmann_ is 14,748 lines of code, while `TJSON` is 962 lines of code - as per `sloccount`). _nhlohmann_ tries to be very general and in fact expands upon the JSON standard, while `TJSON` tries to be as simple as possible. . Also, for `TJSON` I tried to do a bit of ROOT integration. For example, one can get arrays as `TArrayD` or `TArrayI` if possible, or one can assign from `TParameter<T>`. This is simple to make life a little easier for people. . That said, I have no particular preference for either. However, you should consider in the build system to use system available installation of _nlohmann_ instead of using built-in copy.

Integrability,"Hi Xavier,. I would very much like to be able to use ROOT together with the latest oneAPI beta, if at all possible. Since oneAPI comes (amongst many other things) with TBB, if I want to use ROOT reliably in that environment, it should really use oneAPI's TBB version. (In the past this worked quite well for my tests.). Wanting to hide the public TBB dependency from your interfaces is a good goal. But I would not do it with a forward declaration. Even in case the class would not be hidden behind version specific namespaces. If you do need to use the TBB class in the interface of the class, then tough luck. Then the class can just not hide its dependence on TBB, and that's the end of it. You could however try to design the class such that it would not have to directly reference the `tbb::task_arena` type at all in its interface. Then you could cleanly hide the include of this type into the source file. Long story short: TBB is changing its interface, as we've been warned for a while. If ROOT wants to be able to use multiple versions of TBB at the same time, it must stop relying on explicit names like `tbb::interface7::task_arena`...

Integrability,"Hi all! To assess the situation, I tried to build ROOT with CUDNN 9.0 myself, and it is actually a *huge* interface change!. I wouldn't recommend to anyone to do this migration without the help of CI tests, which we don't have for anything CUDA-related. Just for reference, the previous migration to CUDNN 8.0 wasn't done by a core ROOT developer but indeed generously by the Arch package maintainer @kgizdov in 2020:; https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6058; Of the 3350 lines of code in `tmva/tmva/src/DNN/Architectures/Cudnn`, a significant fraction had to be changed. Therefore, we need to have a discussion: should `cudnn` even be enabled in any build of ROOT?.

Also it required some very weird/bad formatting for calling the function ""plotTwoTGraphs"" in the tutorial added, I think it is trying to reduce the number of characters per line, but it does it in a quite poor way. Also the command that the script ""https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/.ci/format_script.sh"" which does this format check says to run to rebase is incorrect.

Integrability,"Hi, I've found this proposal in scope of https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/22616 investigation.; I'd vote for such improvement and can help with it from TBB side. First, I can confirm that TBB 2021 (now it's oneTBB 2021) has CMake build system. Second, oneTBB integration to CMake project may be done in two major ways:; 1. Source integration (`add_subdirectory`) - oneTBB is just built from sources together with user project.; 2. Binary integration (`find_package`) - user project relies on pre-built oneTBB, it is supported through TBBConfig files inside oneTBB packages, for some distributions/versions it will work out-of-the-box, but for others it may require additional CMake variable to be set. [Here ](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/blob/master/cmake/README.md#tbbconfig---integration-of-binary-packages)is a short description of binary integration. The (1) way is supported only starting from oneTBB 2021, while the (2) way was [introduced](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/tree/tbb_2020/cmake#binary-package-integration) in TBB 2017 U7 and slightly changed in oneTBB 2021.

Integrability,"Hi, some update on this. First, let me try to clear a bit the context. I am not sure why `gc.collect` is being invoked here. Manually invoking the Python garbage collector is not going to give any guarantees on which objects are actually destroyed by the interpreter, it depends on the types and sometimes it's even undefined behaviour, as per the docs https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html#gc.collect. Second, even if we had that guarantee, the first and the second loops are doing two wildly different things.; ```; my_data = rvec; ```; Is doing a copy of an `RVec` to another `RVec`, with a thin Python proxy to present it to the user. The copy of an RVec is a well-defined operation in terms of memory management, i.e. it will call the copy-constructor of the `RVec`. Whereas; ```; my_data = numpy.asarray(rvec); ```; Is creating a new numpy array object in memory which is an owning view on the contents of the RVec. The management of the RVec in memory can be clearly seen with this simplified example; ```; process = psutil.Process(). ROOT.gInterpreter.Declare(""""""; auto create_rvec(unsigned int n) {; //return std::array<unsigned int, 3>({n, n, n});; return ROOT::RVec<unsigned int>({n, n, n});; }; """"""); df = ROOT.RDataFrame(100).Define(""my_rvecs"", ""create_rvec(rdfentry_)""); rvecs = df.AsNumpy([""my_rvecs""])[""my_rvecs""]. def get_mem_usage():; return process.memory_info().rss # in kbytes. mem0 = get_mem_usage(); print(mem0). for v2 in rvecs:; n = v2; mem2 = get_mem_usage(); print(mem2); ```.

Integrability,"Hi, thanks for the PR first of all!. Yes, it would be nice to fix that, I see now that the `RooEffGenContext` header and source almost correctly follow the ROOT clang-format style correctly:; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/.clang-format. (well, the header not really, but it also doesn't have that many lines). I think your PR is a good opportunity to correctly format them for good! Could you add an initial commit to this PR where you `clang-format` these files first? You can write in the commit message something like ""this reformatting is done now because the files will be changed in the following commit, and the differences to the ROOT code style were already minor"".

Integrability,"Hi, thanks for the question!. The standard way of do this in ROOT is to use [TParameter](https://root.cern.ch/doc/v612/classTParameter.html) or an `std::` container, as also discussed here:; https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/writing-simple-variable-in-root-files/11094/5.

A package manager can install wherever it wants and can make its own; adjustment (simply copy over the two files, or put symlinks); this will; affect users building from source. I don't worry about package managers,; only about the latter users. As to 'how': the common case mixing; installations (e.g. from packagers and building from source), versions; (different pythons), system upgrades (that wipe out site-packages), or; simply a user doing 'rm -rf' for only half the installation. Users are; very, very inventive in creating trouble. :P None of that if all of ROOT; is kept in a single directory. So the only upside there seems to be is removing of this teeny-weeny; inconvenience of having to setup PYTHONPATH if you install in /usr/local.; But A) most from-source builders don't do that, they use bin/thisroot.sh,; which sets up PYTHONPATH; and B) installing in /usr/local is not; recommended to begin with, b/c of the same problem with remnants. Debugging a setup problem is very time consuming and frustrating: the; error messages are spurious and only occur on the user's machine to which; I have no access. In sum, I see no upside to speak of, but do see enormous downsides. And; if you really believe otherwise: sign that blood contract. Best regards,. ## Wim.

Integrability,"Hi,. the LHCb point of view on the issue is that we must be able to know which code we executed, mostly for debugging purposes (understanding why the trigger application took a specific decision counts as debugging for me). When you have an application that can decide which version of a function to run depending on something you cannot control, like the specific CPU on the Grid node or the time of the day, makes the debugging much more tricky (at some point we started storing in each event the binary id and the CPU type used for that event), so we decided that we do not want this kind of automatic dispatching: an application compiled to run on a Nehalem equivalent CPU should run only instructions valid for Nehalem processors, even if the actual CPU can do better. Our approach is that we still have some functions that have different implementations for different instructions sets (basically scalar, sse4.2 and avx2), but we chose at compile time which one to use by adding something like `-mavx2` or `-march=haswell` to the compile flags. And yes, it should be a cmake flag, but you are most welcome to have also the `ARCH=dynamic` option. OTOH you are talking about RooFit and AFAIK we do not use it in trigger, reconstruction or simulation software, but it is only used for the analysis, and there we have less constraints, as it has become common practice to use Conda based installations, so builds and versions decoupled from our production software.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7361#issuecomment-791253985:304,depend,depending,304,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7361#issuecomment-791253985,1,['depend'],['depending']
Integrability,"Hi,; After some more thinking, I believe we have to close this and rethink the all thing.; I found particularly tricky this point raised by Philippe:. > a good example is two free standings (not attached to any directory) histograms that happens to have the same name in two distinct and independent part of the code (e.g. two CMSSW modules). Supporting this case makes basically impossible to have an identifier for the histogram. In this moment I do not see how we can synchronize objects that we cannot somehow tag being together. In PROOF we somehow implicitly assumed that this could not happen (PROOF is not supporting it). > Rather than a completely global state, wouldn't it make sense to have a wrapper object (for example TThreadedObject) be the holder of the lock and list for a single set of related histogram. This looked an appealing idea. However, it means that the member of a TThreadedObject has to know that is part of a TThreadedObject (which is not the case now) or that we should have a specialized TThreadedObject for histograms that does some settings on the histograms to steer the special behavior. And remains the fact that people will be forced to use a TThreadedObject (which may be ok). Perhaps it is also worth to investigate if we can find an improved bin-finding algorithm that gives consistent binnings in the first place that can be merged. That would solve the problem at the roots.

Integrability,"Hi,; I ran into a memory leak training a BDT yesterday.; Strangely only when running through the root_numpy interface.; The problem appears to scale with number of training events (somewhere between 6.4k and 12.8k training events I run out of RAM); Valgrind/memcheck pointed into `TMVA::DecisionTree::TrainNodeFast` (assuming I read the output correctly. valgrind gave me some 370k lines and i tried with diff'ing a many-event run with a few-event run to get rid of unrelated issues); since this is in an if IMT block, I tried rebuilding root without IMT => tada leak gone.; So diffing the if and else blocks of the preprocessor if (i.e. two different `TMVA::DecisionTree::TrainNodeFast` implementations) I noticed these lines commented out. This patch does not fix the original problem for me, and I'm still on the chase, but the change looks right to me. EDIT: I should add, this does not seem to be a general root_numpy issue because other TMVA methods don't see the issue. the memory only starts exploding during the BDT training. I don't see the issue with tmva through pyroot either. so I really need all three root_numpy+IMT+BDT.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2836:108,interface,interface,108,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2836,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"Hi; few comments after digging a bit in the code... . - it looks the problem is not in the RooDataHist itself but it's in the plotOn function. If you check the RooDataHist content, bin content is equal to the original histogram. The problem looks coming from this line [0]: if you comment it then the plot looks good.; - the plotting problem occurs also when you get a PDF from the RooDataHist using RooHistPdf. If you compare the PDF with the original histogram (scaled to have integral equal to one), the fixed size bin histogram looks good while the variable size bin histogram doesn't. In this case I didn't find how to fix the problem (the RooHistPdf code is a lot more complicated than the RooDataHist routine) but checking the behaviour of the PDF (i.e fitting the PDF to the RooDataHist), everything looks ok both for the fixed and variable size histogram. See the attached modified version of the previous code to see the PDF begaviour mentioned above. Best. Attilio.

Integrability,"Hmmh, but then I'd need to stream path information with every REveText object, now only the font name is streamed. It is indeed a reasonable thing to check if the font files exist before object's json is sent over to the client --- but creating a font during the streaming traversal would be pushing it a bit. Is it possible to register custom prefixes and callbacks from REveManager (via RWebWindow) so they can be handled when requests come in? Like: http://server/sdf-fonts/. I went through the code a bit (but clearly do not have the full picture) ... one way would be to add THttpServer::fActiveLocations, where instead of replacement string one provides a lambda [](TString& prefix, TString& reminder, THttpRequest& req, THttpServer &srv) so one can then do appropriate lookup in the callback, potentially generating the font, and then calling srv->SendFile() (or sending back the default font, if the desired one can not be found/generated). I think this functionality could be useful for other cases in REve, where semi-static data needs to be provided. The font-generation code in REveText invokes TGL generator through the interpreter now, via gROOT->ProcessLine(), to avoid dependency of REve on RGL.

Integrability,"How would we do that with Define?. Is it not possible to store these indexes in the trees when they are produced? If not, currently you have three possible solutions that I can think of:. - calculate the index from the value of `rdfentry_`, knowing how many entries are in each tree and their ordering inside the TChain; - store some unique identifier in each tree when it's produced (even a timestamp works, and although it's not elegant you don't have to worry about having that same value stored in each event because it will compress almost perfectly, occupying very little extra space on disk). With that unique identifier per tree you can build another tree that serves as a lookup table between id and index. It will have two branches, `id` and `index`, with the first taking the values of the ids of each tree and the second being an index from 0 to nTrees-1. Then you can use `TTree::BuildIndex` and `TChain::AddFriend` to add that lookup table tree as a friend of the original chain and thanks to `BuildIndex` the correct value of `index` will be returned for each event depending on the value of `id` in the original chain. More info at https://root.cern/manual/trees/#indexing-trees; - do a pass on each input tree to calculate whatever other quantities you need to calculate (let's call these trees `aux1`, `aux2` etc.), then make a TChain out of the original trees, another TChain out of the `aux` trees, and then add the second chain as a friend of the first (effectively creating a single large ""virtual"" TTree with everything in it). The simplest solution: with the upcoming `DefinePerSample` method you can solve this more easily, but the feature will only be merged in ROOT master in a few days ([PR here](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8841)). With `DefinePerSample` you could write something like this:. ```cpp; df.DefinePerSample(""index"", ""GetIndex(rdfsampleinfo_.AsString())""); ```. where `rdfsampleinfo_.AsString()` will be of the form `<filename>/<treename>`.

Integrability,"I agree that it is an unfortunate circumstance to have the test not passing. However, I still urge you to consider the effect on debugability removing strict tests will have. I have wasted a lot of time trying to track down a subtle bug due to loose tests which left me unable to determine where the bug came from. Conversely, setting tests strictly and tracing discrepancies, I found a different bug in the Kahan sum: #11940. Unit tests especially should be as strict as possible. In absence of unit tests (which unfortunately is the case for the parts of RooFit I worked on), strict ""integration"" tests like these are the closest I could get. Note also that it was simply part of my original assignment: to ensure users can trust the new parallelized methods, I built them to be bit-wise exactly equal to the old methods. So, I know from experience how tedious it is to trace down these bit-wise differences to their actual concrete source, but also think that because we are dealing with scientific software, precision, robustness, reliability and interpretability (of components and hence the whole) are important. Of course, performance is an important factor too, but it's just one of the aspects. We want the end-results of experiments to be accurate and explainable, right? I personally at least don't like when I have to sell a ""because of floating point errors"", because I've been bitten by them a few times now. Now, I'm also well aware that the project only has a given amount of resources and I myself am currently more or less out of resources (I can spend only my free time), so my vote probably doesn't count strongly :) If I could be of more practical help in this, I would definitely be happy to, but I also don't have a non-x86 machine, so it's not feasible for me to do much right now.

When I last touched this, we decided to use variables and rely on the fact that vdt headers were installed into the same place as ROOT headers when Vdt was builtin. However, when Vdt and ROOT are installed separately and into different locations, this doesn't work so well indeed.

Most of these patches can be applied in any order, they do not depend on each other. We can discuss the large modernize-loops commit. I didn't have enough time to go through the loop variable names.

Integrability,I also found the culprit of the new CI failures. It's the Python [tblib](https://github.com/ionelmc/python-tblib) package (a dependency of Dask) that specifically treats the serialization/deserialization of exceptions. A new release appeared on Oct 22th and that somehow forces the serialization of the `std::runtime_error` thrown in the RDataFrame event loop. Downgrading to the previous tblib version makes the problem disappear on the alma9 CI image that I'm testing with.

Integrability,"I am a little concerned about the basic idea. If I understood correctly, there is a (unique) global registry where the histogram are identified based on their 'full path name' (beside the fact that GetNameForRanges seems both brittle and currently seems on first reading 'wrong'/'not-as-intended'). I see two major problems, one is that the 'full path name' may never be really unique i.e. it might be impossible to avoid synonyms that are semantically distincts ... a good example is two free standings (not attached to any directory) histograms that happens to have the same name in two distinct and independent part of the code (e.g. two CMSSW modules). The other major problem is that it unnecessary tie (via that global mutex) all the 'parallel' histogram, this means that the overall scalability is inherently decreased. Rather than a completely global state, wouldn't it make sense to have a wrapper object (for example TThreadedObject) be the holder of the lock and list for a single set of related histogram.; This would both reduce contention and guarantees that the histograms are really related. A 3rd significant problem (but fixeable) is that the operation covered by the ReadWrite lock are not atomic (and/or trivial) and for the look of it could plausibly indirectly request the ROOT global lock and thus can lead to deadlocks (from some other code that hold the ROOT global locks and request the Write part of the ReadWrite lock). A 4th deficiency is that once activated for one histogram it *seems* to apply to all histogram. i.e. as far as can tell if you one parallel histograms and 10,000 single-thread histograms, filling the single-thread histogram still has to go through the multi-thread registration/mechanism. And that remind me, that another challenge for the 'unique registry' solution is to understand its scalability where reaching 10 to 100 thousands histograms.

This option is not normally needed unless developers are expected to modify something the external project's build depends on in a way that is not detectable via the step target dependencies (e.g. SOURCE_DIR is used without a download method and developers might modify the sources in SOURCE_DIR)."".

Integrability,"I figured out the reason of my apparent 'instability' in results. Rather than a problem with the ROOT build, it was actually a variation in the way I generated/created the library needed to emulated the ATLAS libraries. The original 2 files contains respectively 1 and 2 ATLAS classes derived from the RooAbsPdf and because the objects of that type are added to a compiled list, they must be created properly (otherwise you get type detection errors .. in part because RooAbsPdf is an abstract class). In order to generate this library, I use TFile::MakeProject (which almost works, I have to add an implementation for the abstract functions by hand). Part of the this MakeProject is to generate a LinkDef file. Because the output of MakeProject should not depend on the ROOT version, I generated the libraries with an arbitrary version of ROOT (and did not pay attention which one at the time, but it was different on different machine and upon seeing the weird crash, I may have regenerated the project on the machine I was using at the time). The issue is that a particular commit (e8eb7875c73ea00bedf11c022a055d50ec5f081d, part of the new PR) change whether the dictionary was requested (in the LinkDef file) for the pair that was causing the problem (pair<string,RooArgSet>) ... and having an explicit dictionary for that pair works around the problem introduced by the first wave of pair related changes. .

Integrability,"I have a general comment about adding this extra level of parallelism to the branch reading. While it might indeed help in cases where there is only one top-level branch that is split in sub-branches, it could also bring ""too much"" parallelism in some other cases. The performance of the top-level branch parallelism heavily depends on the granularity of the branches. For small branches, the creation of a task does not really pay off. I fear this problem might be exacerbated if we also operate in sub-branches. Moreover, as we offer it now, we won't have any way for the user to select how deep in parallelisation terms they want to go, meaning every time we run GetEntry with IMT on all the parallelism levels will be activated. On the other hand, another thing that hindered performance in the top-level branch parallelism was synchronization. Now there is one synchronization point per entry, which can be problematic if there is load unbalance (that is why we sorted the branches by time). Adding a second level of parallelism means we will have one more synchronization point per top-level branch and we don't know how this can impact performance.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1468#issuecomment-352709176:325,depend,depends,325,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1468#issuecomment-352709176,4,"['depend', 'synchroniz']","['depends', 'synchronization']"

In the end I have not moved the return after `StackTrace`, so with this solution we don't print the stack trace for an unexpected `SIGABRT`.

Integrability,"I recommend not sourcing `thisroot.sh` multiple times in the same shell. That will mess up your environment. This is not related to install/uninstall. If you install ROOT somewhere with `make install`, just add `<prefix>/bin` to your `$PATH` and `<prefix>/lib` to your `$PYTHONPATH` and you should never need to `source thisroot.sh`. Also, if you install your own multiple versions of ROOT with `make install`, I recommend installing into an empty directory, not `/usr/local` where Homebrew may have installed it. Then you can just `rm -rf` if needed to uninstall. If you install into `/usr/local` with a package manager, just use the package manager to uninstall. Installing with `make install` a custom ROOT that overwrites another installation with a package manager is going to get you into trouble and `make uninstall` will not help much. With the uninstall target, if you change configuration before uninstalling, you may have half-uninstalled ROOT left over (e.g by enabling/disabling `pyroot_experimental` between make install/make uninstall), or may remove important files from other packages depending on what builtins you had enabled when you built ROOT.

Integrability,"I said this in my original comments, I am not sure that adding a `ROOT::Libraries` target will help much. It goes against modern CMake usage, and now even things like dataframe can be disabled during configuration, so if someone links against `ROOT::Libraries` to get dataframe, it might not be there. ROOT library targets propagate C++ standard, include directories, and link dependencies now, so I think that it's best to use those when linking instead of a generic target that may or may not contain the libraries you need. We still have the old style `${ROOT_LIBRARIES}` that contains what `root-config --libs` contains if one wants to go that route.

Integrability,"I see, in this case, you can go with the code snippet I pasted above. Since you open the ntuple without your own model, RNTuple needs to generate the model from the on-disk information. The call to `r->GetModel()` calls `RNTupleDescriptor::GenerateModel()`, which in turn uses `RFieldBase::Create()` with the on-disk type string. So you do exercise the type-erased `RRVecField`. More generally, perhaps it _is_ correct to make at least `GenerateValue` and `CaptureValue` non-const (`DestroyValue` could probably be const). An `RFieldValue` emerges from a field, it is linked to it, and it is meant to alter the field's state through reading and writing data. We could possibly add a `const` method like `virtual void *RFieldBase::GenerateType() const;` to just construct the type that is wrapped by the field. (Without such a function, a work-around is to clone the field and generate an `RFieldValue` on the clone.) I'm not sure if it is really necessary. Framework code that uses the type-erased reading API will most likely receive a `void *` pointer from somewhere else. The framework can then use `RNTupleModel::CreateBareEntry()` and `REntry::CaptureValueUnsafe()` to read into that `void *`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10408#issuecomment-1117593717:788,wrap,wrapped,788,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10408#issuecomment-1117593717,1,['wrap'],['wrapped']

MakeProject is irrelevant here. It is ""only"" just to quickly produce an emulation of the ""Experiment Framework"" type of problem size.

But what is odd is that under some circumstances it seems that the const var value is correctly loaded -- it seems connected to if the arg is ""dirty"" or not.

Integrability,"I understand where `PySequence_Check` is coming from (there is e.g. a standard Python `iterator` that will try indexing an object from 0 with integers), but for C++ bound containers (or C++ objects in general), the right question to ask is whether they implement the iterator protocol. E.g. an `std::list` is a sequence and can be iterated over, but not through indexing, as it's not random-access. For `std::map` the same issues exist as for Python, but of course with no special-case exception made in `PySequence_Check` and `std::map<int, T>` is a particular hot mess. Then there's the fact that `operator[](T)` can be redefined in both C++ and Python to mean whatever ... Note that an iterator protocol check would be for `hasattr(obj, '__iter__')` and not `iter(obj)`, as the latter would succeed b/c of that index-based `iterator` mentioned. I'm not really convinced by the `is_sequence()` method proposed, as it would currently fail for this:; ```; import cppyy. cppyy.cppdef(""""""\; struct MyStruct {};; MyStruct* fff = nullptr;; """"""). def is_sequence(obj):; try:; obj[0]; return True; except TypeError as e:; print(e); return False. print(is_sequence(cppyy.gbl.fff)); ```; which prints `True` as all data members are presumed both `*` and `[]`. This should perhaps also be extended to function return types, but returning arrays that way seems to be much less common in practice. Or at least, I've never had that request. Regardless, the problem remains that C++ is simply ambiguous here and I even think it would be fair to assume that `obj[0]` is only every done if `obj` is in fact an array. (Currently not the case, but why not.). Maybe `__getitem__` can be refined to only appear after lookup through `__getattr__`, i.e. to make it fully instance-specific. The result might be confusing as it would still have to be permissive to cover all cases. However, if the check for `__getitem__` is then performed on the class, instead of on the object, it would give you the old behavior back.

Integrability,"I would again prefer to have a run-time option and I think I have a solution that satisfies everyone.

I think we need to collect the prefix stack if we want to be able to filter out, for example, messages from MnLineSearch that happen inside MnMigrad, but not those that happen inside MnHesse. That's why I think the prefix stack should stay. It is also fast, since only a couple of pointers are copied around. However, there is no need to show the full stack of prefixes. By default, MnPrint could just show the prefix from the innermost scope. I added the static method `MnPrint::ShowPrefixStack(bool yes)` to toggle showing the full prefix or not. The default is off so that the messages are not too long. I also now implemented filtering of messages based on the value of the prefix stack. When no filters are set, all messages are shown. Once a filter is set, only messages that match the filter are shown. This is done with strings, using `MnPrint::AddFilter` and `MnPrint::ClearFilter` to reset the filters. Filtering works like `grep` on the full prefix, the message is shown if any of the filter strings match. To only see messages from `MnHesse`, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""MnHesse"");; ```; To only see messages from `MnHesse` called from VariableMetrixBuilder, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""VariableMetricBuilder:MnHesse"");; ```; To only match the beginning of the prefix string, use ""^"". For example,; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""^MnHesse"");; ```; only matches direct execution of MnHesse, but not MnHesse called by MnMigrad. It also works with substrings. To see all messages from any Gradient calculator, one can do:; ```c++; MnPrint::AddFilter(""Gradient"");; ```; to match AnalyticalGradientCalculator, Numerical2PGradientCalculator, and InitialGradientCalculator.

Integrability,"I'm totally +1 for using target-based CMake, and I believe I have fixed the issue of ROOT picking up its own headers here:; https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8709 (needs rebasing). This fixed it at least for many builtins. There still might be more builtins that have the same problem, but let's go one step at a time. I solved the VDT-related part a bit differently. If I rebased, the diff would approximately read (done manually, sorry for possible indentation errors):; ```diff; DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR} COMPONENT extra-headers); set(vdt ON CACHE BOOL ""Enabled because builtin_vdt enabled (${vdt_description})"" FORCE); set_property(GLOBAL APPEND PROPERTY ROOT_BUILTIN_TARGETS VDT); - add_library(VDT::VDT STATIC IMPORTED GLOBAL); - set_target_properties(VDT::VDT; - PROPERTIES; - IMPORTED_LOCATION ""${VDT_LIBRARIES}""; - INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES ""${VDT_INCLUDE_DIRS}""; + add_library(VDT IMPORTED SHARED); + add_dependencies(VDT BUILTIN_VDT); + set_target_properties(VDT PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION ""${VDT_LIBRARIES}""); + target_include_directories(VDT INTERFACE $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${VDT_INCLUDE_DIR}> $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/>); ); endif(); endif(); ```; Whether the target is declared global, static or shared, I'm not sure if it makes a big difference. I'm happy to call it `VDT::VDT`, though. I think the important part was to switch the include directories via generator expressions, and to use **SYSTEM** includes instead of includes in `FindVDT`. #11844 is missing the usage of the `VDT::VDT` target in RooFit and in tmva, but that would come into effect after a rebase of #8709. I guess therefore that we could proceed with merging #11844 if it's green, and then I rebase #8709, so I have to do the rebase work only once. Does that sound reasonable for @amadio, @krasznaa, @bellenot ?. ### Edit ; And to be clear, for `SearchInstalledSoftware` I would leave everything as proposed in Attila's commit but the change to `target_include_directories` with the two ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11797#issuecomment-1339660363:1083,INTERFACE,INTERFACE,1083,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11797#issuecomment-1339660363,1,['INTERFACE'],['INTERFACE']

The relevant part of `mmapsup.c` is:; ```c; #if defined(R__LINUX) && !defined(R__GLIBC) && !defined(__CYGWIN__) \; || (defined(__CYGWIN__) && (CYGWIN_VERSION_API_MAJOR > 0 || CYGWIN_VERSION_API_MINOR < 213)); extern size_t getpagesize PARAMS ((void));; #else; extern int getpagesize PARAMS ((void));; #endif; ```. My understanding is that as musl doesn't define `R__GLIBC`, the condition resolves in favor of declaring `getpagesize` return value as `size_t`. However, this conflicts with the declaration present in `unistd.h` (which is included several lines above this), which declares it as `int` (in accordance with the POSIX standard). The same code snippet also causes error during `core/clib/src/mvalloc.c` compilation. It's not entirely clear to me why should `getpagesize` be declared in the first place, as it is declared in the included `unistd.h` file - my guess is for some kind of compatibility, although POSIX dropped it twenty years ago and Cygwin seems to have implemented it at least four years ago, likely more, I am not sure how this works on Windows - let alone as `size_t`. Thus my suggestion is to remove the above code block from both of the mentioned files entirely, which seems to fix the problem for me (at least until the compilation fails on another problem, which I haven't analyzed yet; and I'm still able to compile for glibc too) and my question is: would it break anything crucial (as I mentioned, `getpagesi",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9253:115,message,message,115,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9253,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"I've been able reproduce this on my desktop (CentOS7, gcc 8.3) when building ROOT from source. The parameter that makes it fail is `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17` (C++ 14 works fine). The reason is: when passing a Python callable as a parameter of a function (e.g. the `TF1` constructor in your example) cppyy automatically generates a C++ wrapper for it. As part of the wrapper generation, cppyy jits Python headers, some of which still use (in Python2) the `register` keyword, which causes an error in C++ 17. For example, when running your reproducer with dev3 these errors appear first:. ```; In file included from /cvmfs/sft-nightlies.cern.ch/lcg/nightlies/dev3python2/Thu/ROOT/HEAD/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/include/CPyCppyy/API.h:30:; In file included from /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/releases/Python/2.7.16-3adfa/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/include/python2.7/Python.h:88:; /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/releases/Python/2.7.16-3adfa/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/include/python2.7/unicodeobject.h:534:5: error: ISO C++17 does not allow 'register' storage class specifier [-Wregister]; register PyObject *obj, /* Object */; ^~~~~~~~~; ```. this is what ultimately causes the `TF1` constructor error, since the C++ wrapper for the Python callable can't be generated.

In short: You would need to cover the case of `vector.size() == 0` in `STLVectorArrayInterface` properly.

Integrability,"In RooFit, there are many functions that return pointers that are owned; by the caller. We can't change this interface anymore, but we can wrap; the return values transparently in a raw pointer wrapper that is called; a `RooFit::Owner`.

This is more flexible and convenient than the existing; cppyy way of flagging the CPPOverloads on the Python side with the; `__creates__ = True` attribute for at least two reasons:. 1. This flag can't be applied at the granularity of indivirual C++; overloads; 2. It's only on the Python side, so if you want to flag these functions; in C++ as well as in Python you have to do some bookkeeping. A unit test was implemented to check that the `RooFit::Owner` behaves in; Python as expected, and that there is no memory leaking when using; functions that return them.

I'm not sure how much of a difference this has made in practice in the past three years, as I'm not a user of RooFitExtensions. Maybe @cburgard can say more (or find someone who knows).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11736#issuecomment-1319839498:354,message,message,354,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11736#issuecomment-1319839498,2,"['integrat', 'message']","['integration', 'message']"

Integrability,"Indeed, this solution only improves the error message to solve the problem of ; 1. losing the information of the error reported by the `TTF` library function (for us it was `0x17` = `bad pixel size`); 2. not knowing the context of the call (input values). In our case it was enough additional information to identify the origin of the error as being a bad input value and exclude troubles at the `libTTF` packages level such as missing package(s) or mismatching versions (or also in the `tsize` calculation or in `libTTF`, but these were anyway unlikely given the 20+ years of usage). It would probably be helpful to have in addition some info on the call stack, but I do not know enough of `ROOT` core methods to propose anything there.; As I could track the source of the bad values in our code with the old-school ""add temp printouts around calls from top to bottom"" method, I must confess I stopped my investigation here :sweat_smile:",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14592#issuecomment-1929667487:46,message,message,46,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/14592#issuecomment-1929667487,1,['message'],['message']

The integral of the Gaussian has the correct value (`V`) servers (the parameters of the Gaussian):; ```; (0x7ffc9b9bf798,-S) RooRealVar::x """"; (0x7ffc9b9bf240,--) RooGaussian::gauss """"; (0x7ffc9b9bff68,V-) RooProduct::par_mod """"; (0x55ac531cd470,V-) RooConstVar::2 ""2""; ```.

That means, the direct value server `par_mod` is **skipped** now,; misrepresenting the client-server relationship. The new BatchMode makes strong use of the value-server interface for the; `RooFitDriver`, so it's very sensitive to `RooRealIntegrals` getting it; wrong. That's why this commit suggests to change the logic in `RooRealIntegral`; to always add the next direct value servers that don't depend on the; integration variable, and not the leaves. A unit test that verifies that the value servers of the integral are the; mathematically direct value servers and not the computation graph leaves; is also implemented.

Integrability,"It happens often that one passes a temporary RooArgSet to the; RooCmdArg constructor, where the RooCmdArg is itself a temporary that is; passed to a RooFit function. The RooCmdArg contains only pointers to the; RooArgSets, so this pattern relies on the RooArgSet being kept alive; until the function end. In code, this pattern would look like this statement:; ```C++; func(RooCmdArg{RooArgSet{}});; ```. In C++, this works because the temporaries survive until the statement; end. But in Python, the inner temporary RooArgSet will be destructed; after the RooCmdArg has been constructed, leaving the RooCmdArg with; dangling pointers. To solve this problem, all the functions that can create a RooCmdArg; from a RooArgSet are overloaded with versions accepting rvalue; references. These overloads are indeed used for temporaries both in C++; and Python. In the rvalue reference versions, the temporaries are moved; into a vector of std::unique_ptr<TObject>. The constructed RooCmdArg; then takes ownership of this vector wrapped in a shared_ptr.

Integrability,"Maybe a few more notes to make the review easier, because this is a huge patch. * The previous code used macros to log things. I found that the macros are not needed, so I replaced all the macros with method calls to MnPrint::Error, MnPrint::Info, ....; * The old logging made a useful habit of prefixing messages with a string to indicate the origin, e.g. when you logged from MnHesse, messages would be prefixed with ""MnHesse:"". Inside ``MnHesse``, to stay with the example, you might have seen code like this; ```c++; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some foo happened"");; [...]; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; Setting the prefix by hand was error prone and repetetive and made the logging code more distractive from the actual code. Especially now, since all the debug messages should also have this prefix, I wanted to automate this. So I turned MnPrint into a class that one can instantiate with a prefix for a given scope.; ```c++; MnPrint print(""MnHesse""); // appears once at the beginning of a long method; [...]; print.Info(""Some foo happened"");; [...]; print.Info(""Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; print.Info(""Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; The method ``MnPrint::Info`` uses the prefix set in the MnPrint ctor. The ctor of MnPrint also has an optional argument to print with a local print level. If this is not set, the global print level is used. In the long run (not in this patch), we should get rid of the global print level, because global mutable variables are difficult to reason about and in particular do not play nice with multi-threading. This design prepares for that step.; * I generally made sure that the logging messages contain the same information as the previous ones, but I reduced excess whitespace and improved the formatting. Some debug messages added several empty lines to the output, which made the logs hard to read.; * In very few isolated cases I removed redundant messages.

Integrability,"Merge the `RooIntegrator1D` class with its slight variations: `RooIntegrator2D`, `RooSegmentedIntegrator1D`, and `RooSegmentedIntegrator2D`. To reflect the fact that it can now be used for the n-dimenstional case, it is renamed to `RooRombergIntegrator`. This greatly reduces boilerplate code to implement the different numeric integration methods (more detail in the PR description).; It will also make porting the numerical integration with the Romberg method to the GPU much easier.

Integrability,"Minuit migrad minimization: 1. the setup phase where the initial gradient is calculated and 2. the line search phases. To make the above possible, a few bugs had to be fixed:; - `RooAbsL` classes have `evaluatePartition` which allows you to specify the range of events and components over which to evaluate the likelihood. This had some bugs: the extended term and possible subsidiary components were added for each partition, leading to N duplicates (for N partitions). Commits 3db2e0dd36478813cfb534451f459348e8d90da9 and c2a8bc9df029f65ee575e140825af6c509860538.; - As a result of this fix, which reorders some terms in the sum, the LikelihoodGradientJob test was failing for a specific case due to increased floating point differences. We would like to add back in an option for retaining bit-wise exact same results in the future, but since the minimization still converges to the same value within the desired precision, for now we leave it like this, since the user can still pick the old ways if they prefer their exact old results. Commit b7f7fa7b705e2dfb767187dce3f6a32275f30d9e.; - `LikelihoodJob` had a bug where it didn't reset its `result` sum variable to zero before doing a new sum. Commits 042e1577d8c303d532016537e7467d6e2fbfcd9c and 44197a2a64f77b47587e5ee200d360c4514b8098. Finally, I made a mini optimization in `LikelihoodJob` by using `publish_from_master_to_workers` more efficiently, which reduces communication overhead slightly (and makes the code a bit cleaner). Also in commit 567b7988d56b6c1db6102d857b523fc2da607dbc.

Integrability,"Multi-range fits in RooFit are more complicated than they should be. In principle, all that is required is to change the normalization range of the PDF to the union of the ranges. There is a RooAbdPdf interface to suggest that this could be done easily like this:; ```C++; pdf.setNormRange(""range1,range2""); ```. But this doesn't work well for RooAddPdfs, which is probably why it was chosen to implement mulit-range fits as a sum of separate RooNLLVars. But in this case, the PDFs are normalized separately, and extra terms need to be introduced to correct for that. This resulted in lots of complicated code, and still there are issues like #11447, i.e. is still doesn't work for simultaneous fits. That's why I decided to fix the `setNormRange()` for RooAddPdfs, and then starting from that re-implement multi-ranged fits in both the new BatchMode and the old RooFit based on that. .

Integrability,"My 2 cents:. 1. It is extremly weird/ a bug that the webgui needs to depend on `TObject`.; 2. `RBrowserDataCleanup` derives from `TObject`, so it *must* have a `ClassDef` as per https://root.cern/manual/io_custom_classes/#the-classdef-macro . I am not sure about what using `ClassDefInline` as suggested by @pcanal would change; 2a. Can `RBrowserDataCleanup` just avoid inheriting from `TObject` completely? ; 3. `RBrowserData` has a dictionary and allows I/O, as it is defined in `LinkDef.h`, so it is only natural that its data members need a dictionary as well. As @hahnjo commented, the particular error coming from a `std::tuple` is due to the fact that the class uses ` std::unique_ptr<RBrowserDataCleanup>`. Bottom line, to me everything looks very clear and I don't understand the comments regarding looking for a deeper reason behind the error.

Integrability,"My reasoning for removing usage of `std::string_view` is that using `const std::string&` avoids copying memory and only requires C++11, while `std::string_view` requires C++17 or a backport. Moreover, along with the extra requirements of `std::string_view`, when it is passed by value it uses a pointer + length, which means possibly twice the size of just a reference. If we are not using the editing potential of `std::string_view`, or even worse, are just using it to actually make a copy of the data inside, then I see no real advantage in using it relative to just using a reference to `std::string` in the interface that basically does the same job better without adding the extra requirements of a higher C++ standard and/or a backport.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/804#issuecomment-318633601:612,interface,interface,612,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/804#issuecomment-318633601,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"My two cents. The root cause of the problem is understood and it is what you mentioned. However, the way this presents to users is that if they run the following code on a large-enough inputs:. ```python; >>> f = ROOT.TFile('DYJetsToLL.root'); >>> t = f.Get('Events'); >>> t.Draw('GenPart_pdgId'); ```. users _silently_ get a completely wrong histogram:. ![image](https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/10999034/1d53b401-cf13-471c-bf6f-908835845b20). instead of the histogram they _should_ get:. ![image](https://github.com/root-project/root/assets/10999034/4bfc1d5d-e7e6-450a-b3c0-783cfccbda3a). Even if you are lucky enough that the histogram is so wrong that you spot the problem immediately, it is then very difficult to go from ""my histogram is wrong"" to ""low floating point precision makes `Fill` effectively a no-op inside `TTree::Draw`"". So difficult that I do not think one can reasonably expect users to diagnose the issue themselves. With that said, new interfaces already moved to TH1D by default instead of TH1F, and TTree::Draw cannot be changed to produce a TH1D for the backward-compat issues Axel listed above, so the only remaining option, AFAICT, is to add a check after every `Fill` or deprecate `TTree::Draw`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6671#issuecomment-1861816430:970,interface,interfaces,970,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6671#issuecomment-1861816430,1,['interface'],['interfaces']

RooUniform u_nt_x(""u_nt_x"", ""u_nt_x"", x);; RooUniform u_nt_y(""u_nt_y"", ""u_nt_y"", y);; RooProdPdf uxy_nt(""uxy_nt"", ""uxy_nt"", RooArgList(u_nt_x, u_nt_y));. So I have 5 pdfs for which I need to create a separate uniform distribution on (x, y), which in turn requires creation of new pdfs on x (and on y), which are all uniform and absolutely the same. This leads to 15 new lines of code, which is not that much, but seems redundant (as names and titles of the uniform distribution on all x) and even more error-prone (because of very similar code).

First is that we *must* build a dictionary before we use a header file. We are likely missing a build dependency on `ROOTGpadv7`. I believe you are trying to fix the second problem. Namely, `TLine.hxx` includes `TPadPainter.hxx` which includes `TDisplayItem.hxx` and you end up with the cycle `ROOTGraphicsPrimitives -> ROOTGpadv7 -> ROOTGraphicsPrimitives`. It seems that `ROOTGraphicsPrimitives` is a foundational module. Its header `TLine.hxx` should not depend on headers in `ROOTGpadv7`. @Teemperor is right, `TLine.hxx` should not depend on `TPadPainter.hxx`. You can break that loop by introducing a forward declarations of `TPadPainter.hxx` entities where necessary if definitions are not required. This is how the current master's modulemap looks like (maybe this helps to see the cycle).; ```; module ""ROOTGraphicsPrimitives"" {; requires cplusplus; module ""ROOT/TColor.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TColor.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TDisplayItem.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TDisplayItem.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TDrawingAttr.hxx"" { header ""ROOT/TDrawingAttr.hxx"" export * }; module ""ROOT/TDrawingOpts",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2091#issuecomment-392598607:1979,depend,dependency,1979,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2091#issuecomment-392598607,1,['depend'],['dependency']

There we have (essentially):; ```; {; gROOT->ProcessLine("".L loadcode.C+"");; ...; TTree *t; _file0->GetObject(""t"",t);; }; ```; The use of TTree means that before executing the script libTree is laoded.; During the execution of CompileMacro, the depend library are loaded (see for example the collection line [3363](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/f32d06e70ce357b53050a25eecd5186859021e30/core/base/src/TSystem.cxx#L3363) .; And in this case the result is:; ```; loadcode_C.so libTree.6.21.01.so libTree.so; ```; which coupled with the ***new*** feature that gSystem->Load first dlclose the library then reopen it means that libTree is dlclose 2 or 3 times (one for both the versioned and unversioned version). This behavior is a **very significant** departure from the existing behavior (where, because the libraries were added to the link line, the library were never reloaded). Reloading arbitrary depend library is never a good idea since they (are likely to) include static object that may do things that are **essential** to do only once (initialization, connection to db). Technically CompileMacro could (as it does elsewhere) first check if the library is loaded. But still several questions:. 1) Why is libTree listed twice in the list of depend library?. 2) When should gSystem->Load automatically reload a library, if ever?. @Axel-Naumann @vgvassilev opinions?.

Integrability,"Originally, I used https://github.com/GooFit/Minuit2 - that uses a python script to re-copy the changed files from the ROOT sources. Being a git repository, it also easily is included as a submodule in the `/extern` folder for GooFit, for example. After meeting and talking with @lmoneta a couple of days ago over a coffee, he outlined the procedure I initially implemented. He showed me the old ""build"" directory, with an old bash script that copied the necessary files out. He wanted me to make a new folder to eventually replace his build folder. The idea is that you could create source distributions that would be packaged and made available as downloads to continue the outdated ones available here: http://project-mathlibs.web.cern.ch/project-mathlibs/minuit/release/download.html. I added this though `make package_source`, and included `make package` for binary distributions as well. The integrated version does look a bit better, though it is a bit more invasive and not nearly as well separated. I do need to copy to `/inc/Math`, etc, since a source distribution needs to be in the source directory. Everything is copied to `INSTALL_PREFIX/include` when it's installed or packaged for a binary distribution. As for use, a git only solution really is not feasible, unfortunately, with any method that does not include git submodules. The current methods for a user are:. * Install beforehand from one of the downloadable packages, either building a source package or installing a binary package. This is the way some people will get it, but not ideal for a modern package that wants to have minimal dependencies.; * Have CMake download and build the package with `ExternalProject` - probably the best solution for now, still not as nice for something like GooFit that already has all dependencies as git submodules.; * Check out all of ROOT as a submodule, then `add_subdirectory(extern/root/math/minuit2)`.

Integrability,"Partial fix of #8708.; In a setup where ROOT was installed in a system directory, ROOT was picking up headers from that directory instead of its own. . ## How to reproduce:; 1. `echo '#error This is the wrong header' > /my/include/directory/RooSpan.h` (or a few other headers).; 2. Install some builtins into that directory, e.g. VDT; 3. `cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/my/include/directory/ <root>` to create a dependency to that include directory.; 4. Build. The problem only becomes visible when `A` depends on `B and C`, and `B` depends on something in `/system/include/`, and `C` is installed in those system includes as well. This generates a compile command such as:; ```; -I.../core/x -I.../core/y -I.../core/... -I.../A/include -I.../B/include -I/system/include/ -I.../C/include ...; ```. ## In this PR:; - Includes for VDT and XROOTD are fixed by making them `IMPORTED` targets, so their includes have lowest precedence.; - Some cheating where include directories are copied around between targets is removed. CMake should handle this.; - Some dependency and target management is simplified (or rather modernised with target-based cmake); - A broken dependency in RooFit is fixed, which was previously hidden by the cheating with include directories. ## What remains to be done:; It is likely that more builtins (or rather `FindXXX` have to be converted to `IMPORTED` targets, so they don't provoke this error again. A broken configuration can be detected by; 1. Having CMake pick up a dependency in some common directory; 2. Either; - Placing a lot of `#error`-ROOT headers in there or; - Searching `compile_commands.json` for `-I/my/include/directory/`; 3.

Integrability,"Possible reason for the problem, in Cling (also Clang) some headers are included automatically at startup to simplify the operation. In the case of CUDA, the order of the headers is really important because CUDA has to annotate the `stl` functions to be available on CPU and GPU (e.g. `int std::abs(int n)` -> `__device__ __host__ std::abs(int n))`. If the order is not correct, various things can happen (no GPU version available, redefinition errors, error messages that have nothing to do with the actual problem ...). A good starting point for bug hunting is to compare the startup process of vanilla cling and ROOT cling.; * A good starting point for Cling the is the function [`CIFactory::createCIImpl()`](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/de3514c2a88f653584108d2be64e28f50a2b29da/interpreter/cling/lib/Interpreter/CIFactory.cpp#L1214); * In ROOT, some extra headers are injected (before?) in the [TCling](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/a56901942dfefa6e7e2e7df397a60c9d1cda31a0/core/metacling/src/TCling.cxx#L1327) class",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7518#issuecomment-808738232:459,message,messages,459,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7518#issuecomment-808738232,4,"['inject', 'message']","['injected', 'messages']"

Integrability,"Probably due to historical reasons, the Minuit2 code uses several systems to report errors, warnings, and debug info. Some of these only work when certain compile flags are set (WARNINGMSG and DEBUG). I would like to unify these systems and use the MnPrint facilities consistently everywhere. This would have the advantage that debug info can be turned on at any time without recompiling and it has additional advantages for frontends to Minuit2, like [iminuit](https://github.com/scikit-hep/iminuit). I would like to work on this, but need some feedback before I invest time. ### Proposed changes. Currently, there are three systems to report info, errors, warnings, and debug messages. The latter two need to be enabled with compile flags (WARNINGMSG and DEBUG). Examples from VariableMetricBuilder.cxx:. Direct use of the MnPrint facilities (this is the ""proper"" way); ```c++; if (PrintLevel() > 1) {; MnPrint::PrintState(std::cout, result.back(), ""VariableMetric: Iteration # "",result.size()-1);; }; ```; Use of MnPrint macros for info messages that are only enabled when WARNINGMSG is set; ```c++; #ifdef WARNINGMSG; MN_INFO_MSG(""VariableMetricBuilder: initial matrix not pos.def."");; #endif; ```; Use of DEBUG and std::cout; ```c++; #ifdef DEBUG; std::cout<<""VariableMetricBuilder convergence when edm < ""<<edmval<<std::endl;; #endif; ```; The latter two need to be enabled at compile-time. If they are enabled, there is no fine-grained run-time control, because the MnPrint system only distinguishes two verbosity levels 0 and 1. On level 0, only errors are reported. On level 1, errors and ""info"" are reported. I propose to enhance this by two more levels. - level 0: report errors; - level 1: all of level 0 + warnings; - level 2: all of level 1 + info; - level 3: all of level 2 + debug. and add the corresponding macros; ```c++; MN_WARN_MSG; MN_WARN_MSG2; MN_WARN_VAL; MN_WARN_VAL2; MN_DEBUG_MSG; MN_DEBUG_MSG2; MN_DEBUG_VAL; MN_DEBUG_VAL2; ```; in addition to the existing MN_INFO_* and MN",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421:678,message,messages,678,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421,1,['message'],['messages']

Integrability,"ROOT injects forward declarations of entities as trampolines to resolve the full definitions and load the corresponding library. This allows the ROOT users to 'just' type a name and the interpreter will resolve its definition and dlopen the library describing it. There is a well-known (not well understood until now) limitation with this system: we cannot load entities in namespaces. Namely, if we type `ROOT::TDF::TDataFrame;` the system won't be able to resolve it. This is because we enable the system to load only the contents of namespaces from the forward declarations. For example,; ```cpp; // rootmap file; namespace ROOT{ namespace Experimental { class TDataFrame; } } // #1. // real code; namespace ROOT{ namespace Experimental { class TDataFrame {}; } } // #2. [root] ROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame d; // #3; ```; `#1` is piped at root/interpreter start up; we find the DeclContext and flag it. `#3` triggers a lookup and `#includes #2`. The problem is that we do not issue a lookup in `#2`. The effect is that we practically cannot autoload entities from namespaces. Turning it 'just' on breaks performance and starts loading irrelevant libraries. This is because clang eagerly deserializes template specialization declarations for the decl context in question when computing linkage information in CodeGen. All heavy lifting is done in [D41416](https://reviews.llvm.org/D41416) and landed in e51a2b9de4. It enables finer-grained template specialization deserialization removing the effect of loading irrelevant libraries. The performance impact will be seen shortly after we land this PR.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1547:5,inject,injects,5,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1547,1,['inject'],['injects']

I bisected this to commit https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/46ba2eefd00371b024ae239626c7600cd3259885 (""Enable a few modules for Windows"") which introduced a check to filter dependencies without cxxmodule. There are (at least) two problems with this check: First, we add the `cpp_module` which is equal to the `library_target_name` and not the pcm file name. This results in currently no module dependencies being passed to `rootcling` at all because the condition is never true!. This could be fixed by checking `dep IN_LIST local_modules_idx_deps`. However, that still doesn't work because `local_modules_idx_deps` does not contain all modules from the start but is constructed on-the-fly. This is particularly a problem for `libCore` whose dictionary is only created after the other libraries located below `core/` are processed, for example `Imt`. The problem is that `libImt` depends on `Core`, but at the time `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` is called for `Imt`, it doesn't know yet about the dictionary of `Core`. Finally, I'm not sure if completely omitting the dependency for a target with `NO_CXXMODULE` in case of `runtime_cxxmodules` is correct. Based on the code around, I would expect to fall back to `*_rdict.pcm` in that case. Note: This change will probably break the (partial) support for modules on Windows, but for the the reasons spelled out above, I don't see an easy fix given the current situation.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12561:52,depend,depending,52,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12561,5,['depend'],"['dependencies', 'dependency', 'depending', 'depends']"

Historically the configure script has been more feature complete and some things that the configure script is able to do are either missing or broken in the cmake build. However, new features are often only added to the cmake build. This has resulted in that today neither of the two is able to build root with a complete set of features. The cmake build is more standard and behaves in a more predictive way, e.g. it understands CFLAGS, LDFLAGS and friends which the configure script never did. It also integrates the test suite in the build and allows for running ""make test"", a feature that the configure script is missing. So the cmake build is in many ways better, if it wasn't for those missing and broken things mentioned earlier.

Integrability,"S I use the following code to set up the generation of dictionary source files:. https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/master/Build/AtlasCMake/modules/AtlasDictionaryFunctions.cmake. And that provides a much better behaviour. Mainly because in ATLAS's setup dictionary generations do not need to wait for anything. Even if the library that a dictionary is being produced for depends on a number of upstream libraries, the dictionary for that library can be generated before all the upstream libraries would have finished building. In practice this actually means that the start of any ATLAS software build is dominated by running dictionary generation. As GNU Make and Ninja both prefer running those build steps first. (As they do not have any dependencies themselves.). The reason I blame the dictionary generation code is that regular C(\+\+) code building with Ninja scales very well to many cores. Even when one has many small libraries in a project, Ninja can start the build of object files before all of the libraries that they depend on would've finished building. (In ATLAS's offline software the very end of a build is taken up purely by library/executable linking steps.). ## To Reproduce. Unfortunately you need a pretty powerful machine to do so... But once you do, just do something similar to what I did:. ```; cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 \; -Dall=ON -Dbuiltin_gsl=ON -Dbuiltin_freetype=ON -Dbuiltin_lzma=ON -Dbuiltin_veccore=ON \; -DXROOTD_ROOT_DIR=~/software/xrootd/4.12.2/x86_64-ubuntu2004-gcc9-opt \; -DTBB_ROOT_DIR=~/software/oneTBB/2020.2/x86_64-ubuntu2004-gcc9-opt \; -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/software/root/6.20.08/x86_64-ubuntu2004-gcc9-opt ../root-6.20.08/; ninja; ```. ## Setup.

Now, set the start point of the filling to be the end of the previous filling rather than the start of the current cluster (which can sometimes; be before the end of the previous filling). Issue: The error message was inaccurate, it did not take into account jagged filling of the TTreeCache. In this case, the cache was filled with a little more than one cluster and when it needs to do the next refill it restarted from the cluster start boundary of that partially downloaded cluster which is “indeed” within the range of the last TreeCache fill (i.e. the error). We did not see the problem with a local file because the TTreeCache usage is different. CMSSW take note of whether prefetching (asynchronous reads) is available for a while or not. In the setup CMSSW has, the prefetching (asynchronous reads) is available for the local file but not for the network/remote file. In addition when prefetching (asynchronous reads) is not available, CMSSW uses multiple TTreeCache for a given TTree while it uses only one when prefetching (asynchronous reads) is available.

Integrability,"Signed-off-by: Stephan Lachnit <stephanlachnit@debian.org>. # This Pull request:. ## Changes or fixes:. Fix for #12152. Requires #12153. The idea is the following:. - add `libbsd` option & `find_packge` module defining `LIBBSD::libbsd` target; - define `R__USE_LIBBSD` in `RConfigure.h` if `libbsd` enabled; - adjust `strlcpy` to include `bsd/string.h` if `R__USE_LIBBSD` defined; - add `LIBBSD::libbsd` to the public linking interface of `Clib`. Unfortunately, this does not work. The reason here is that (for some reason beyond me) `rootcling_stage1`, `libCling.so`, `bin/root` and probably more don't link to `Clib` as *target* but instead fetch the *target object* directly. Relevant CMake documentation:; - [`$<TARGET_OBJECTS:tgt`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html#genex:TARGET_OBJECTS); - [Object Libraries](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html#object-libraries); - [Linking Object Libraries](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.13/command/target_link_libraries.html#linking-object-libraries). Example using `rootcling_stage1`:.

Integrability,"Some boost histogram utility functions have trouble being called from PyROOT. I've traced this back to what looks like a name normalization problem. Unfortunately I did not manage to put together a standalone example without the boost histogram dependency. Consider the following test case:. test.c; ```cpp; #include ""TInterpreter.h""; #include ""TClass.h""; #include ""TMethod.h""; #include <iostream>; #include <boost/histogram.hpp>. int test() {; auto ns = TClass::GetClass(""boost::histogram"");; auto meth = ns->GetMethodWithPrototype(""make_histogram"", ""boost::histogram::axis::regular<>&&"");. std::cout << ""meth->GetReturnTypeName(): "" << meth->GetReturnTypeName() << std::endl;; std::cout << ""meth->GetReturnTypeNormalizedName(): "" << meth->GetReturnTypeNormalizedName() << std::endl;. auto cl = TClass::GetClass(meth->GetReturnTypeNormalizedName().c_str());; std::cout << ""cl: "" << cl << std::endl;. return 0;; }; ```. output:; ```; meth->GetReturnTypeName(): boost::histogram::histogram<tuple<boost::histogram::axis::regular<double,boost::use_default,boost::use_default,boost::use_default> >,boost::histogram::unlimited_storage<allocator<char> > >; meth->GetReturnTypeNormalizedName(): boost::histogram::histogram<tuple<regular<double,use_default,use_default,use_default> >,unlimited_storage<allocator<char> > >; cl: 0; (int) 0; ```. So note that the normalized return type is missing the ```boost::histogram``` namespace for the template arguments of the std::tuple. (and then obviously trying to lookup the type again fails). This prevents properly calling this function and other similar ones from PyROOT because the normalized return type is used e.g. here https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/4483b01b7f4bad47332f98d773dbd9b8c7f36b9d/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy-backend/clingwrapper/src/clingwrapper.cxx#L1515",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12548:245,depend,dependency,245,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12548,1,['depend'],['dependency']

We add a new method `Unwrap()` to obtain the inner type by value. The caller takes ownership of the inner type, and for move-only types the `RResult` is left in an unspecified state. I decided against adding safeguards against double-moves for now because it would result in false-positive messages for types without move specializations (e.g. `return std::move(42)`). Instead, we should make clear through documentation and examples that `Unwrap()` consumes the `RResult`. . The existing const-ref access method `Get()` has been renamed `Inspect()` following Mozilla's `RResult`-like type [here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mfbt/Result.h#90-91). `Get()` has caused some confusion in code review and we've been looking for alternative names. . Example: ; ```cpp; auto TestMoveOnly = []() -> RResult<std::unique_ptr<int>> {; return std::make_unique<int>(1);; };; auto res = TestMoveOnly();. // Using Inspect to make a copy won't compile; // auto copy_inner = res.Inspect();. // This will compile, but we only have read-only access; const auto& copy_inner = res.Inspect();; EXPECT_EQ(1, *copy_inner);. // Instead, Unwrap is required to get ownership of the move-only type; auto move_inner = res.Unwrap();; EXPECT_EQ(1, *move_inner);; move_inner.reset();; move_inner = std::make_unique<int>(2);; EXPECT_EQ(2, *move_inner);; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5985:161,wrap,wrap,161,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5985,2,"['message', 'wrap']","['messages', 'wrap']"

The problem stems from the fact, that the condition for using `socklen_t` is (among others) glibc:; ```c; #if (defined(R__AIX) && !defined(_AIX43)) || \; (defined(R__SUNGCC3) && !defined(__arch64__)); # define USE_SIZE_T; #elif defined(R__GLIBC) || defined(R__FBSD) || \; (defined(R__SUNGCC3) && defined(__arch64__)) || \; defined(R__OBSD) || defined(MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_4) || \; (defined(R__AIX) && defined(_AIX43)) || \; (defined(R__SOLARIS) && defined(_SOCKLEN_T)); # define USE_SOCKLEN_T; #endif; ```; [Here](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/xrat/V4_xsh_chap02.html#tag_22_02_10_06) is some context:; > All socklen_t types were originally (in BSD UNIX) of type int. During the development of POSIX.1-2017, it was decided to change all buffer lengths to size_t, which appears at face value to make sense. When dual mode 32/64-bit systems came along, this choice unnecessarily complicated system interfaces because size_t (with long) was a different size under ILP32 and LP64 models. Reverting to int would have happened except that some implementations had already shipped 64-bit-only interfaces. The compromise was a type which could be defined to be any size by the implementation: socklen_t. I am not sure how to approach this, because the standardization of `socklen_t` seems fairly recent, but in the long run, avoiding this whole types dance altogether and simply using explicit `socklen_t` seems to make most sense and will make for a simpler code.

Integrability,"Take a model with completely independent identical observables that have both a signal and a background component:; ```; p(x,y) = p(x) * p(y) = (s(x) + b(x)) * (s(y) + b(y)) ; ```; It should be equivalent to define this as a sum of products:; ```; p(x,y) = s(x,y) + b(x,y) = s(x) * s(y) + b(x) * b(y); ```; All sums in these expressions are normalized sums. However, in RooFit, you get different probabilities depending on how you define the model, either as a product of sums or sum of products.

Integrability,"Tests has been augmented and refactored to avoid code duplication. There's one issue that I'm not sure how to solve: random access iterators are required to support the forms `it + n` as well as `n + it` (where `n` in our case is of type `std::ptrdiff_t`. The second form requires the definition of a free-standing `operator+`, which I implemented this way:. ```c++; template <typename T>; auto operator+(std::ptrdiff_t n, const typename TTreeReaderArray<T>::iterator &it); -> decltype(it + n); {; return it + n;; }; ```.

Integrability,"Thank you very much for this, this is obviously much nicer than our horrible solution and highly appreciated. I cannot judge everything since I'm not familiar enough with these details. One thing different to our hack which I don't see here is the name of the file. We set `fName` to a hardcoded constant (empty didn't work) so that we're not dependent on the name of the file on creation. (for example I can create a file with `mkstemp()`, write and then rename and I will get the same checksum as writing directly to the final name). At the very least it would be necessary to be able to construct the file with the same name in different directories and still obtain the checksum but I would prefer if the filename doesn't have any affect on the checksum. . I would be fine if I can set the name after creating the file but it looks to me that the first key with the file metadata is written right in the beginning and a later change might not have the desired effect?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4253#issuecomment-524211456:343,depend,dependent,343,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4253#issuecomment-524211456,1,['depend'],['dependent']

But if we decide *not to normalize* the RooDataHist used to create the RooHistPdf,; the RooHistPdf -> getVal() will return a value normalized to the number of events of the RooDataHist : so in this case it gives a *non-normalized result*. This is strange since it is stated : ""The histogram distribution is explicitly normalized by RooHistPdf and can have an arbitrary number of real or discrete dimensions. "". Indeed, with my minimum example where you may put the option option_normalize_hist=0 (with the fix that you kindly found of <=55 bins); we get :; value_pdf total=39.9713; which represents : pdf->getVal()*bin_width. so in this case, we don't need to multiply by the number of events to obtain a prediction !!; The value of the pdf is not inside [0, 1]. So, depending whether the RooDataHist that was used in order to construct the RooHistPdf, was normalized or not normalized, the RooHistPdf->getVal() returns a normalized or a not normalised result,; in contradiction with the sentence that roofit is expected to do it : the sentence : ""The histogram distribution is explicitly normalized by RooHistPdf and can have an arbitrary number of real or discrete dimensions.

Integrability,"Thanks @amadio for the extensive input! Let me address it point by point:. First: the current choice for ""built-in only"". The built-in is there for two reasons: 1) as a dependency, obviously, but 2) also because the full source is needed to build `zmq::ppoll`. `ppoll` was written as an extension to libzmq itself. In the ideal world, I would have committed this back to libzmq (which they are open to, and which I'll do later, see https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/4220), but haven't had time yet. The interim solution is to just ship it with ROOT, but this requires (part of) the libzmq source to build against. We can do this in two ways: a) just include the necessary libzmq files or b) get them externally on the fly. I actually went with option a) first. However, when people started trying out this branch on their machines, it turned out that the `conda` libzmq build (which I was using in my dev setup) had a more favorable configuration than for instance most Linux native builds, especially because those native builds lack CMake configuration files. That latter fact made me decide to just make the built-in dependency the default; this way I wouldn't have to figure out how to best detect libzmq on each platform (or find / cobble together a good and freely licensed FindZeroMQ.cmake, but the general feeling around the ZeroMQ community is that this is a waste of effort, because the CMake config files that come along with libzmq itself already solve this finding problem; it's just unfortunate that the Linux distro's won't include them...). So in the end, because of time constraints, I made the choice to prioritize other things over putting a lot of effort into this dependency which will probably end up different in the near future anyway (because of the ppoll PR, which will make things a lot easier on the ROOT side). So, long story, I hope it is clear. Do you think that given this (temporary) situation, the choice for built-in only is acceptable?.

Integrability,"Thanks Philippe. After further consideration, i think you're right. I had indeed been concerned about a possible deadlock, but i had thought; that it was probably ok because a similar change was working fine; in production. But (a), i had forgotten about the dlopen lock and (b),; they weren't exactly the same change. As i alluded to above, we didn't; want to have a custom patch to ROOT, so for production we address this; race by wrapping dlopen. But in that case, the core lock is acquired; _before_ the call to dlopen, not after. So, what is to be done?. There is probably only one code path in ATLAS that was giving us problems.; The Gaudi plugin manager was being used to load one of the POOL libraries; that happened to include ROOT dictionary information. I could; acquire the ROOT core lock around this (and one or two other places; where i known that Gaudi components may be loaded after event processing; starts). However, there are many other places where shared libraries; could potentially be loaded. While those probably don't matter...; the original bug here was quite opaque, taking several months; to completely track down. So i'm loathe to leave open any possibility; that it could bite us again. We could add locking within TClassTable. This is perhaps an attractive; way forward, as it should make it much easier to ensure that usages; of TClassTable are correct. A drawback is that is hard to then ensure; that we don't have something else that is also supposed to be protected; by the core mutex. Nevertheless, i could try to prepare a change; to do this if it sounds good. However, that's not the end of the problems. If this analysis is correct, then we _already_ have potential deadlock; problems, as there is nothing to prevent the initialization code of a; shared library (which can be arbitrary used code) from calling into ROOT; in a way that would acquire the core mutex. So code which would look; innocent to the user would have a chance of deadlocking.; I'm not sure ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071:433,wrap,wrapping,433,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071,1,['wrap'],['wrapping']

Integrability,"Thanks for being willing to help here - I do understand the pain... We have thousands and thousands of user C++ files (macros) that rely on ROOT's `using namespace std`. We have that since the birth of ROOT, and we intentionally implemented it again for cling / ROOT6.

Both are bad options, but IMHO the first is worse. As I said, we're considering replacing it with a bunch of `using std::cout` etc - but that might not help you, if `std::any` is part of the list. ROOT's `using namespace std` is even required for some (at least old) files to be read, so its suppression has more consequences than just at the prompt. We don't have a feature to ""dump cling input"" - because much of cling's input is actually synthetic AST, and code that gets unloaded again, or code that is injected without proper code context, e.g. `std::vector<MyClass>` might be looked up by some part of cling, the I/O, or PyROOT, and that's not valid code by itself, yet has very visible effects on cling, triggering instantiation etc. If you have an idea of how to approximate this let me know!.

Integrability,"Thanks for the attention to it. Maybe I was too enthusiastic in the context of displayed objects and interactive root sessions. I'm not an expert, but still learning. Th RDirectory looks interesting. Subroutines leaving global objects lying around still seems funny. It could be convenient for casual scripting. As an example of a main routine, and a subroutine that ""makes"" a TCanvas that persists after a .x, I'd be inclined to skin the cat this way:. ```; // my_subroutines.C; void my_subroutine(unique_ptr<TCanvas> &x) {; x.reset() // TCanvas requires the extra step, see note below.; x.reset(new TCanvas());; // .. do something with it.; }; ```. ```; //make_canvas.C; namespace root_global { ; unique_ptr<TCanvas> c1;; }. void make_canvas() {; // we decide at the top level to use a global here:; my_subroutine(root_global::c1);. //This one doesn't use a global and will die, our choice; unique_ptr<TCanvas> local_canvas;; my_subroutine(local_canvas);; }; ```; or if being a little more lazy, I'd likely use static instead of the namespace, but the root interpreter doesn't respect translation unit boundaries well. Really I'd use a class though in case I need to add more global things easily:. ```; //display.h. class display {; private:; unique_ptr<TCanvas> c1;; public:; void make_canvas() {; c1.reset(); ; c1.reset(new TCanvas());; }; };; ```; And use it like:; ```; //make_display.C; #include ""display.h"". namespace root_global { ; display my_display;; }. // main routine:; void make_display() { ; // This one will stick around; root_global::my_display.make_canvas();. // This one wont. ; display local_display;; local_display.make_canvas();; }; ```. There are two main differences compared to the PR. 1) I'm not letting the subroutine allocate heap objects that aren't handled explicitly by the caller. 2) I'm using standard C++ that even works fine right now in root 6.

Integrability,"Thanks for the great comments @guitargeek! All the ones I didn't comment on I agree with, so will implement those soon. I agree that it has become quite a complex class. It would be nice if things could be refactored at some time. However, part of it is also inevitable, I fear, because `RooMinimizer` has to bridge between two rather different frameworks, that of Minuit2 and RooFit, and now due to all the parallel processing work will have to deal with even more stuff than before. By the way, just as a historical aside: at some point I had turned `RooMinimizer` into a fully templated class, which made it even more horrible to maintain and time consuming to develop (since the header had to be recompiled on every change). I managed to trim the template horror down to just the constructor by introducing `RooAbsMinimizerFcn`. That introduced its own complexity here and there, as we discussed above :) But it was better in the end, I think. Note that the sole reason the template parameter is still necessary in the constructor is that the `MinimizerFcn` needs the proper constructor inside the `RooMinimizer` constructor. I like your suggestion of also using the template class argument instead of the `dynamic_cast` using `std::is_same`, but this is not strictly necessary like using the proper constructor is. By the way, note also that in the upcoming TestStatistics PR, there will be yet another `RooMinimizer` constructor, also with template arguments, but different ones, namely the concrete calculator classes for the likelihood and gradient.

Integrability,"Thanks for you comments @lmoneta.; I'm sorry for my late reply but since nothing happened here for over a month, I stopped watching. The reason I used double pointers for the 2D arrays was to have the most low level datatype possible, have full felxibility and stay consistent with the other TGraph classes which are all using pointers for 1D arrays. Nevertheless I understand your concerns since double pointers for arrays are a rather dirty way of programming. I think it might be a good compromise to use the ROOT array wrapper class TArrayD. Then the two dimensional Arrays could be represented by an 1D array of TArrayD objects. The functions SetPointEY, SetPointEYL and SetPointEYH were implemented by me to keep full consistency with the TGraphAsymmErrors class. They are overloaded with one version taking the point and an array in which case the array cointains all errors of the named point for the different dimensions. My idea was to alter the TGraphAsymmErrors notation as little as possible so TGraphAsymmErrors::SetPointEY(i, el, eh) would translate to TGraphMultiErrors::SetPointEY(i, &el, &ey) in the case of only one error dimension which would be equal to a TGraphAsymmErrors. The idea of the function SetDimensionEY, SetDimensionEYL and SetDimensionEYH is basically the same. They set the errors of all points in the given dimension. My idea was to think of a way to convert from multiple TGraphAsymmErrors objects to one single TGraphMultiErrors object like in this small example:; ```; TGraphAsymmErrors* statisticErrors = ...; TGraphAsymmErrors* systematicErrors = ... TGraphMultiErrors* theGraph = new TGraphMultiErrors(statisticErrors->GetN(), 2, statisticErrors->GetX(), statisticErrors->GetY(), statisticErrors->GetEXlow(), statisticErrors->GetEXhigh());; theGraph->SetDimensionEY(0, statisticErrors->GetEYlow(), statisticErrors->GetEYhigh());; theGraph->SetDimensionEY(1, systematicErrors->GetEYlow(), systematicErrors->GetEYhigh());; ```.

So e.g. I would have code like:. ```; RooDataSet ds(""data"",""data"", RooArgSet{a,b,c}, RooFit::GlobalObservables(RooArgSet({x,y,z}));; ds.getGlobals(); // return RooArgSet* to global observables, or null pointer if Dataset has no global observables attached; ds.getGlobals()->setRealValue(""x"",4); // changing the value in the global observables; ```.

Integrability,"The ""Math/Error.h"" header is not shipped with standalone Minuit2. It is not a perfect solution to just ship it with Minuit2, because the Error.h header behaves differently depending on the `MATHCORE_STANDALONE` macro being defined or not. The code would only work correctly if the user defines the `MATHCORE_STANDALONE` herself in the user code that uses standalone Minuit2, which would be annoying. Instead, this commit proposes another solution to the problem: for all headers also used in Minuit2 standalone, MathCore; moves the definitions of all functions that use `Math/Error.h` out of the header files in the cxx files. Like this, the `Math/Error.h` is only a build dependency of standalone Minuit2, and the user doesn't need to define the `MATHCORE_STANDALONE` macro for it to work. Including the ""Math/Util.h"" header needs to be avoided for similar reasons (it's about another preprocessor macro related to `veccore`).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13646:172,depend,depending,172,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13646,2,['depend'],"['dependency', 'depending']"

When executed creates a file where the object ""h"" gets the default title ""object title"":. ```bash; $ rootls -l myfile.root; TH1F Aug 21 10:41 2021 myhistoname;1 ""object title""; ```. This commit adds an extra check in the TKey constructor above. If the object is derived from TNamed, then we know that it has a title (either empty or provided by the user), so we should use that instead of ""object title"". It could be interesting to have a way to; generalise this to classes that have a `GetTitle(), SetTitle()` interface, but it would be more difficult. After this commit, the example; above outputs a file that contains the histogram object with the correct title:. ```bash; $ rootls -l myfile.root; TH1F Aug 21 11:00 2021 myhistoname;1 ""myhistotitle""; ```. ## Note; This commit provides an idea of a fix, if there's a faster way to get to the object title that doesn't involve all those casts it would be great :smile:",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8879:282,interface,interface,282,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8879,2,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"The `RooAbsL` class is implemented for four kinds of likelihoods: binned, unbinned, ""subsidiary"" (an optimization for numerical stability that gathers components like global observables) and ""sum"" (over multiple components of the other types).

On top of the likelihood classes, we also provide for convenience a set of likelihood builders. The calculator ""`...Wrapper`"" classes are abstract interfaces. These can be implemented for different kinds of algorithms, or with different kinds of optimization ""back-ends"" in mind. In an upcoming PR, we will introduce the fork-based multi-processing implementation based on `RooFit::MultiProcess`.

For example, to run a coverage build in debug mode, with less verbose output, and showing test output when a test failure happens, one can run:; ```sh; ctest -V --output-on-failure -C Debug -DCOVERAGE=1 -S test.cmake; ```; Some environment variables can also influence the behavior of the script, like `CC`, `CXX`, `CMAKE_GENERATOR`, `CTEST_CONFIGURATION_TYPE`, `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL`, `CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL`, `CMAKE_ARGS`, `CDASH`, `DESTDIR`, `BASE_REF`, `HEAD_REF`, and GitHub Actions environment variables. These are mostly self-explanatory and can be used to override the provided defaults. For example, to build with the clang compiler and use Ninja as CMake generator, one can run:; ```sh; env CC=clang CXX=clang++ CMAKE_GENERATOR=Ninja ctest -V -S test.cmake; ```; Finally, the script tries to load configuration files from the `.ci/` subdirectory in t",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14999:148,integrat,integration,148,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14999,1,['integrat'],['integration']
Integrability,"The analytical integral code of the `RooTruthModel` was making the wrong assumption that if one uses the single-sided bases, the minimum x value is always at zero (or the maximum value at zero, for the case of the flipped bases).

This commit rewrites the RooTruthModel analytical integral code to also consider these cases. To avoid that with the additional code branches the code becomes too verbose, the code was refactored to use a helper function for evaluating indefinite integrals of symmetric or asymmetric basis functions.

Integrability,"The ctor of `GSLMCIntegrator` creates a `GSLRngWrapper` instance on the heap and calls its `Allocate()` member function which in turn allocates memory for a GSL random number generator via `gsl_rng_alloc()`.

However, `~GSLRngWrapper()` frees the allocated memory only if `fOwn` pointer is set to true, which is only set so in the assignment operator, but not in the `Allocate()` member function.

Integrability,"The idea of the RooGenProdProj is that we divide two integral objects; each created with this makeIntgral() function to get the normalized; integral of a product. Therefore, we don't need to normalize the; numerater and denominator integrals themselves. Doing the normalization; would be expensive and it would cancel out anyway. However, if we don't; specify an explicit normalization integral in createIntegral(), the; last-used normalization set might be used to normalize the pdf,; resulting in redundant computations. For this reason, the normalization set of the integrated pdfs is fixed; to an empty set in this case. Note that in RooFit, a nullptr; normalization set and an empty normalization set is not equivalent. The; former implies taking the last-used normalization set, and the latter; means explicitly no normalization. This fixes the performance regression reported in https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11814, and a new unit; test is implemented to make sure no new numeric integrals pop up in the; reproducer code to that issue.

A new unit test to cover this was also implemented.

Integrability,"The main change in this PR is that the `CustomColumn` term is replaced by the clearer, shorter `Define` term. This require quite a few changes all over RDataFrame internals. Motivation for the change can be found below, copy-pasted from the commit message. This will make future backports a bit of a pain, but I think it's worth doing it now, for the following reasons:; * we are at a historical low of RDF-related open bugs -> less backports are expected in the future; * recent large refactorings in RAction.hxx (#6220) and in the column reader logic (#6170) already make backports much less likely to apply cleanly to release branches, so if there is a less bad time to do this, it's probably now; * expected upcoming refactorings necessary to support bulk entry processing will put another nail in the coffin of backportable bug-fixes; * I think we can all agree that RCustomColumn is a terribly opaque name for something that at this point we all know as a ""Define"", and in a few years I'd rather not have doctoral students complain about how my class names are completely arbitrary and unnecessarily hard to understand . The original commit message:. Until recently, RCustomColumns could correspond to data-source columns; or defined columns. Due to recent refactorings, RCustomColumns are now; back to serving only their original purpose: representing Define nodes; in the computation graph.; RCustomColumn is a very opaque name, and it crops up when debugging,; reading code and looking at performance profilings.

This happens because the library depends on other libraries (`libXrdCrypto`, `libXrdUtils`) and cannot find them since the `@rpath` palceholder is not substituted with the correct path to the libraries directory at runtime.; While this is true for the xrootd libraries in `build/lib`, it's not for the ones in `build/XROOTD-prefix/../src` which have the `LC_RPATH` variable set. The difference can be shown with `otool -l`; ```; $ otool -l build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so > libXrdSecpwd_buildlib.txt; $ otool -l build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src/libXrdSecpwd-4.so > libXrdSecpwd_xrootdprefixlib.txt; $ diff libXrdSecpwd_buildlib.txt libXrdSecpwd_xrootdprefixlib.txt; < build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so:; ---; > build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src/libXrdSecpwd-4.so:; 307a308,311; > cmd LC_RPATH; > cmdsize 80; > path /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src (offset 12); > Load command 14; 312c316; < Load command 14; ---; ```. This `LC_RPATH` variable is set for our own libraries, e.g. `libHtml.so`; ```; $ otool -l build/lib/libHtml.so; [...]; Load command 15; cmd LC_RPATH; cmdsize 80; path /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/lib (offset 12); ```; But for some reason this information is lost after building `builtin_xrootd` (probably while installing the libraries from the prefix to the install directory). A way to solve this is by manually adding the `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH` option to the `cmake` invokation of `builtin_xrootd` as is done in this PR. The result is:; ```; $ otool -l build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so; [...]; Load command 15; cmd LC_RPATH; cmdsize 80; path /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/bui",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6128:409,depend,depends,409,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6128,1,['depend'],['depends']

Integrability,"The previous implementation required TGeoTessellated shapes to be read attached to a TGeoManager. This removes the limitation, and allows also reading geometry files containing shapes converted to VecGeom corresponding solids. # This Pull request:. ## Changes or fixes:; * Restructured the `TGeoFacet` helper class, eliminating referencing vertices stored in the associated `TGeoTessellated` object, since this required calling a specific method `TGeoTessellated::AfterStreamer` to fix all the facet objects. The new version moves all vertex operations from TGeoFacet to the TGeoTessellated class, making the latter readable from a root file even if not connected to a `TGeoManager`; * Added persistency to the class `TGeoVGShape` which interfaces `TGeoShape` to `vecgeom::VPlacedVolume`. This allows to write/read geometry files after being converted to VecGeom. Upon reading, a check is made that the current root version was also compiled with VecGeom support, and if this is not the case a `Fatal` exception is fired. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally; - [ ] updated the docs (if necessary).

Integrability,"The reason for this behaviour seems to be that all the Python classes in the reproducer (`B`, `C` and `D`) get a `Dispatcher` wrapper class automatically created (`Dispatcher1`, `Dispatcher2` and `Dispatcher3`, respectively) that inherits from `A`. Since for `B` and `C` `fun1` is overridden in Python, `Dispatcher1` and `Dispatcher2` define a `fun1` implementation that redirects the call to the Python `fun1` of `B` and `C`, respectively. That is not the case of `D`, whose `Dispatcher3` defines no `fun1`. What I described above explains the behaviour reported in this ticket. When calling `d.fun2()`, which in turn calls `fun1`, the latter will be resolved to `A::fun1`, whereas one would expect that it is the `fun1` defined in Python by `B` that is called instead. This issue does not exist in upstream cppyy: `Dispatcher3` inherits from `Dispatcher1` (`B`'s dispatcher) and not from `A` directly, which means that the call to `fun1` from `fun2` will be resolved to `Dispatcher1::fun1`, which will redirect the call to Python (`B`'s `fun1`).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6470#issuecomment-713715166:126,wrap,wrapper,126,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6470#issuecomment-713715166,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']

Integrability,"The work of this MR has been presented in RooFit developer meetings a few times already. However, I would like to put this forward not as a ""final MR"" (would need to be rebased anyway), but as a way to get a preliminary review of this code. Purpose: HistFactory and RooWorkspace should be able to import and export their contents from and to text files, using a common JSON/YAML syntax. Method: The code has been written in such a way as to. - Minimize the amount of changes to existing code; - Make it as easy as possible for users to add new serializers/deserializers for new or existing classes; - Provide a clean interface as much as possible. Dependencies: The code requires a JSON/YML parser and emitter.; ROOT already includes the nlohmann JSON module, which is used as a default for the interface.; However, for development, I have been using the rapidyml package, which also supports reading and writing of YML files. As the code for this already exists, I have kept this in as an optional dependency. When available, it replaces the nlohmann interface and then also provides YML reading and writing capabilities, while the default is limited to JSON. Please review:. - general coding style; - packaging: Should these new files continue to live in RooStats, or should they go to a new subpackage of RooFit?; - code placement: Is the way I split the functionality up into different source files acceptable, or would you wish for a smaller/higher granularity of the splitting?; - build system: Is the way I encoded the optional dependency acceptable?; - class and function names: Are the names of classes and functions acceptable, or should things be renamed to be more conformant?. Please don't review yet:; - lack of functionality - more things will be added over time; - individual violations of the style guide (e.g. missing spaces or newlines) .

Integrability,"There are a number of trivial operations that users often want to perform on dataframes that are surprisingly hard to get right, for example adding several `Define`s in a loop or conditionally adding a `Filter` depending on a runtime boolean (both use-cases are challenging in C++, trivial in python). The way I see it, difficulties boil down to the fact that different dataframe nodes have different types (because their types incorporate e.g. the type of the callable passed to a `Filter` and the type of their parent node in the computation graph). In this PR I propose to add a common base class `ROOT::RDF::RNode` to all nodes of the graph (except leaves a.k.a results, which have a completely different interface),; so that users can, for example:; * take any dataframe node by reference in non-template functions as `RNode&`; * `emplace_back` dataframe nodes in ~`std::vector<RNode>`~ `vector<RInterface<RNode>>`; * have non-const pointers to dataframe nodes. and so on. For example, conditionally adding a `Range` do a dataframe now looks like this:. ```c++; auto maybe_ranged = [&df, mustAddRange] { ; return mustAddRange ? ROOT::RDF::RNode(d.Range(1)); : ROOT::RDF::RNode(d); ; }(); ; ```. while before this PR one would have to add fake `Filter(""true"")` filters to normalize the return type of the lambda, involving the interpreter for no reason. Internal `RDataFrame` code is also simplified by the introduction of this common base class.; The only downside I can think of is that if this mechanism is abused users might end up with extra, unnecessary virtual calls in their event loop -- on the other hand, this mechanism should only be used in situations that required either complex template magic or dirty and slow tricks before. Questions:; * can we come up with a better name than `ROOT::RDF::ToCommonNodeType` for the function that upcasts any dataframe object to the same type?; * should this cast only be explicit through an upcasting function call or should we allow implicit cas",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2182:211,depend,depending,211,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2182,2,"['depend', 'interface']","['depending', 'interface']"

Integrability,"This PR adds a first iteration of snapshotting to RNTuple from an RDataFrame. It uses the existing `Snapshot` interface, with an addition to `RSnapshotOptions`, `kOutputFormat`. This option can be set to write to either TTree, RNTuple, or take the default choice. The table below describes how `Snapshot` behaves accoring to the output format option:; | | From TTree | From RNTuple | From other DS |; | -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |; | **To TTree** | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kDefault` | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kTTree` | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kDefault` |; | **To RNTuple** | Not yet possible, will be added in a follow-up, using functionality from `RNTupleImporter` | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kDefault` | `ESnapshotOutputFormat::kRNTuple` |. ## Implementation; As mentioned, the existing `Snapshot` interface is used. A new `SnapshotRNTupleHelper` has been created to handle the creation and writing of the RNTuple, akin to the existing `SnapshotHelper` (which has been renamed to `SnapshotTTreeHelper` for consistency). ### RLoopManager data source initialization (rev bbf221f); The snapshot action creates a new loop manager which manages the snapshotted data set. The loop manager gets initialized before the actual snapshotting takes place. Originally, the pointer to the data source owned by the loop manager was marked as `const`. Because the RNTuple's data source _has_ to be created after the loop manager, for this PR the `const` qualifier has been dropped. ### Move `ROOT::RDF::Experimental::FromRNTuple` (rev 0a29b02); For snapshotting RNTuples, we need to include the header file for RNTupleDS in `ActionHelpers.hxx`. To avoid dependency conflicts related to including `ROOT/RDataFrame.hxx`, the free `FromRNTuple` functions have been moved to a separate header. ## Current limitations and follow-ups; This PR adds the minimal functionality for (single-threaded) snapshotting to RNTuple.

Integrability,"This PR adds a new data source for `RDataFrame` that is able to provide data from SQlite `SELECT` queries. It will be useful for cvmfs, where we have file catalogs and monitoring information in sqlite files. For instance, one can do. auto rdf = ROOT::RDF::MakeSqliteDataFrame(""catalog.sqlite"", ""select * from catalog"");; auto h = rdf.Define(""lname"", ""name.length()"").Histo1D(""lname"");. to show the distribution of file name sizes. There are probably more use cases, for instance sqlite export of conditions data. This is work in progress, I'm posting it for early comments and feedback. My open points are. - Unit and integration tests are yet to be done; - The data source work single-threaded only at the moment. I initially thought it might be enough to return only a single row in `GetEntryRanges()` to make it thread-safe but that's apparently not enough. So I'm now thinking to wrap `SetEntry()` and `GetEntryRanges()` in a mutex.; - The code is not reusing `TSQLiteServer`. It felt like it requires stretching the `TSQLServer` interface in perhaps unwanted ways, for saving only a handful of direct sqlite API calls. On the other hand, with (probably quite a bit) more work it might be possible to have a more general data source that works on any SQL result set.; - Determining column types in SQlite is tricky as it is dynamically typed and in principle each row can have different column types. If a table column is queried as is, I can use the default/declared column type. For expressions, I'll use the type of the first row of the result set. Still it can result in a column to be of type `NULL` where subsequent rows actually have meaningful values. My guess is that the current heuristic is practical enough, and of course the user can formulate the `SELECT` query to avoid ambiguity.; - It would not be impossible to add support for remote reading of sqlite files.

This allowed us to exactly (floating point bit-wise) replicate the Minuit2 gradient calculation outside of Minuit2 itself, allowing us to parallelize this gradient calculation process exactly without having to worry about breaking Minuit2. The replication, `NumericalDerivatorMinuit2`, was based on earlier work by @lmoneta who already had separated out the bulk of the gradient calculation code from Minuit2.; 2.

Integrability,"This PR allows us to use [`liburing`](https://github.com/axboe/liburing), the ""application-level"" interface to [`io_uring`](https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf), the new Linux kernel IO interface.; `liburing` takes care of many of the low-level details (e.g. `mmap` calls, barriers) required to correctly use `io_uring`. `io_uring` is supported on Linux kernels 5.1 and up, but it's up to the user to download and install `liburing` themselves, either from source (`make && make install`) or through a package manager. The rationale for including `liburing` in ROOT is to experiment with `io_uring`'s parallel, async IO features. This may drive performance improvements in low-level IO. . I based the CMake changes on how `jemalloc` is handled. I am not very experienced with CMake and would be happy to find out that I've done something wrong here.

In the current version of jsroot the d3 script has been updated to version 4 and the file is now called d3.min.js. The pull request changes the name of the file in the two places where it is referenced, so it should now find the file.

This PR does not introduce any other changes than changing the name of the js file in the two places where it is referenced in the code, just as PR #1520 does. The API of d3 v4 is not fully backward compatible with d3 v3. Did you go through the code and check that nothing else needs to be changed?

Integrability,"This PR is a do-over of #8385 and #8412 and, as such, again the second part of a split and clean-up of #8294. The most important blocker in those PRs was the inclusion of a patched libzmq in RooFitZMQ itself. [This patch has now been included in libzmq proper](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/4255). Another blocking review comment was that libzmq symbols must not be allowed to be exported through our libraries. [This has been solved in theory, and in practice is pending another PR to libzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/4266). Having fixed these two blockers, we should now be able to continue. To recap:. > In this PR, we introduce two packages: RooFitZMQ and RooFit::MultiProcess. It also adds two builtins for ZeroMQ to ease dependency management: libzmq and cppzmq. The builtin for libzmq is especially necessary at this point because it has recently gained a necessary feature that has not been released yet.; > ; > RooFit::MultiProcess is a task-based parallelization framework.; > ; > It uses forked processes for parallelization, as opposed to threads. We chose this approach because A) the existing RooRealMPFE parallelization framework already made use of forks as well, so we had something to build on and B) it was at the time deemed infeasible to check the entire RooFit code for thread-safety. Moreover, we use MultiProcess to parallelize gradients -- i.e. the tasks to be executed in parallel are partial derivatives -- and these are sufficiently large tasks that communication in between tasks is not a big concern in the big fits that we aimed to parallelize.; > ; > The communication between processes is done using ZeroMQ.

Integrability,"This PR is the second part of a split and clean-up of #8294, as suggested by @guitargeek. In this PR, we introduce ~three~ two packages: ~RooFit::MultiProcess,~ RooFitZMQ and a ZeroMQ builtin to ease dependency management. ~RooFit::MultiProcess is a task-based parallelization framework.~. ~It uses forked processes for parallelization, as opposed to threads. We chose this approach because A) the existing RooRealMPFE parallelization framework already made use of forks as well, so we had something to build on and B) it was at the time deemed infeasible to check the entire RooFit code for thread-safety. Moreover, we use MultiProcess to parallelize gradients -- i.e. the tasks to be executed in parallel are _partial derivatives_ -- and these are sufficiently large tasks that communication in between tasks is not a big concern in the big fits that we aimed to parallelize.~. Edit: We decided to keep this PR for ZeroMQ only, MultiProcess will come in a next PR. The communication between processes is done using ZeroMQ.

It also removes move-only semantics on `RFieldDescriptor` (my eventual intent is to remove move-only semantics on all `Descriptors`). `RFieldDescriptor` is made up of value-types only, so there are no resources to worry about. . For merging `NTuples`, we need to copy many descriptors (possibly with some small adjustments). ; With move-only semantics, we'd have to implement a `Clone` method for `RFieldDescriptor`. ; This is disadvantageous compared to relying on value semantics. `Clone`, while conceptually simple, is additional code to maintain.; * If we ever add fields to the class, Clone could be buggy (missing the added field); In contrast, the copy constructor will never miss any fields. ; * Move-only object lifetimes are non-trivial to reason about, we increase the risk of introducing UB by relying on a moved-from object, etc. .

Integrability,"This Pull request extends `RPageSink::RPageSinkDaos` to implement `RPageSinkDaos::CommitSealedPageVImpl()`, of signature: ; ```c++; vector<RNTupleLocator> RPageSinkDaos::CommitSealedPageVImpl(span<RPageStorage::RSealedPageGroup> ranges); ```; , which is virtually declared in the parent class `RPageSink` since PR #10775. . The implemented method modifies the default behavior for committing page ranges, i.e. calling `::CommitSealedPage` repeatedly for each individual page. ; Instead, it coalesces the buffered page ranges - e.g. all pages in a column or cluster - into a batch of vector writes, enabling I/O parallelization after recent optimizations to the `RDaos` library. . As with the batched fetching case in `RPageSourceDaos::LoadClusters()`, the page write requests are aggregated by the pair (Object ID, Distribution Key). This pair is part of the `RDaosKey` determined by the mapping strategy set in `kDefaultDaosMapping` from the pages metadata and the `RPageSinkDaos` instance's atomic counter `fPageId` that uniquely identifies pages in the storage sink. ## Changes or fixes:. * Implements `std::vector<RNTupleLocator> RPageSinkDaos::CommitSealedPageVImpl(std::span<RPageStorage::RSealedPageGroup> ranges)`; * Modifies the default behavior in `RPageSink::CommitSealedPageV()` to coalesce pages before sending out the write request to storage; * Enables optimized (i.e. batched) vector write requests of multiple pages within a column range by exploiting the refactored `RDaos` interface and the generalized ntuple-object mappings in `RPageStorageDaos`. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally and on openlab cluster `olsky-03` with DAOS 2.0.x; - [ ] updated the docs (if necessary).

Integrability,"This adds a new standalone Minuit2 build system built in CMake to replace the old one that no longer works. The following features are part of the design:. * Full featured CMake build, based on https://github.com/GooFit/Minuit2; - Only requires CMake 3.1+; - Support for adding as a subdirectory, using from build directory, or installing; - Works inside of ROOT or standalone; - Support for CPack binary `make package`; - Options for MPI and OpenMP integrated with main ROOT build; - Support for macOS, Linux, and Windows; - Version captured from ROOT; - CTest support; - `make docs` support (CMake 3.8+ only); * No need for extra ""prepare"" shell scripts, everything is done cross-platform through CMake and CPack; - Files can be copied in to make redistributable source with `-Dminuit2-standalone=ON`; - `make package_source` on Unix creates `.tar.gz` and `.zip` files (non-binary CPack); - `make purge` can remove copied files; * Helpful `README.md` and `DEVELOP.md` files. ### To produce a source distribution:; Make sure you have CMake 3.1+ (ROOT requires 3.4.3+, so that's likely). Then, from `/math/minuit2/build` run:. ```bash; cmake .. -Dminuit2-standalone=ON; make package_source; make purge; ```. ### You can also build Minuit2 for testing (standalone option on or off) with:. ```; make; ```. ### And you can make a prebuilt binary package with:. ```; make package; ```.

Before this commit:; For the TTree based case, the entries of the range are global with respect to the TChain created inside the distributed task.; `TChain.SetCacheEntryRange` is called with the start and end entries of the range to make sure we don't read more than needed; An RDataFrame is created with the chain as argument. The `Range` operation is used to select only the entries of the TChain in the current task that are inside the input entry range. After this commit:; For the TTree based case, the input range will report global entries with respect to the TChain of the task. But it will also report local entries with respect to each single file of the TChain in the current task.; A global TEntryList is created and filled with one sub-TEntryList per file in the chain. This allows to do a preselection directly in the TChain of the entries that should be processed or not.; `SetCacheEntryRange` is still called to ensure we don't read more than needed (hence the need to still keep global entries in the range object); The TChain (with the TEntryList) is passed as argument to an RDataFrame constructor. ## TODOs. - [x] ~add some check against using multiple times the same filename, to prevent hitting https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8505~ No longer needed after #8660 ; - [x] Old tests adapted to new logic; - [x] Added one new test to check against reading the wrong number of entries depending on the number of partitions (a result of using TEntryList with multiple times the same treename and filename)",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8646:1766,depend,depending,1766,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8646,1,['depend'],['depending']
Integrability,"This commit introduces a new layer on top of RDataFrame to enable distributed computations. It is a port of the previously known PyRDF python package, that includes all changes discussed recently in the team. The python package, inside bindings/experimental/distrdf, is dynamically injected into the ROOT.RDF namespace. TODO:; 1. Figure out a better approach to injection, currently the following happens:; ```; >>> import ROOT # ok; >>> import ROOT.RDF # ok; >>> from ROOT import RDF # ok; >>> from ROOT.RDF import Distributed # ok; >>> Distributed; <module 'DistRDF' from '/home/vpadulan/Programs/rootproject/rootinstall/branchdev/lib/DistRDF/__init__.py'>; >>> import ROOT.RDF.Distributed; Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>; File ""/home/vpadulan/Programs/rootproject/rootinstall/branchdev/lib/ROOT/_facade.py"", line 121, in _importhook; return _orig_ihook(name, *args, **kwds); ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ROOT.RDF'; 'ROOT' is not a package; >>> from ROOT.RDF.Distributed import Spark; Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>; File ""/home/vpadulan/Programs/rootproject/rootinstall/branchdev/lib/ROOT/_facade.py"", line 121, in _importhook; return _orig_ihook(name, *args, **kwds); ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ROOT.RDF.Distributed'; 'ROOT.RDF' is not a package; ```; 2.

Integrability,"This commit introduces an alias for raw pointers for indicating that the return type of a RooFit function is an owning pointer that must be deleted by the caller. For RooFit developers, it can be very useful to make this an alias to `std::unique_ptr<T>`, in order to check that your code has no memory problems. Changing this alias is equivalent to forcing all code immediately wraps the result of functions returning a `RooFit::OwningPtr<T>` in a `std::unique_ptr<T>`. The two fundamental RooFit functions `RooAbsArg::getVariables()` and `RooAbsArg::getParameters()` are also migrated to this new alias, and I tried to recompile ROOT locally using the `std::unique_ptr<T>` alias. This commit includes also the necessary changes to make ROOT compile with both raw and smart pointer alias, always wrapping the result of these functions in `std::unique_ptr<RooArgSet>`. There are many benefits of this alias, and my ultimate goal here is to eventually make PyROOT aware of it to always take ownership of the referenced objects. But it's also a great tool for developers to check that there are no memory issues in RooFit code. Now that this PR sets the first examples of how to use this alias, I can make further migrations also a good warm-up projects for new contributors such as students.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12614:378,wrap,wraps,378,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12614,2,['wrap'],"['wrapping', 'wraps']"

Integrability,"This depends on #5998 . - TMVA was somehow vetoing dataframe python tutorials.

Integrability,"This is a followup to commit 47c250898f3. The new algorithm to figure out the servers of a RooRealIntegral could get very expensive for large computation graphs, as seen with the ATLAS Higgs combinaiton. The problem was that there was a loop over an arguments clients for each argument in the computation graph. In this commit, loop is replaced by another loop over the computation graph in which one iterates only over the servers of the arguments that depend on the integration variables. I think this logic is even more intuitive to understand as well. I learned also that iterating over clients is never a good idea, because while the number of servers is well defined, there can be arbitrary many clients, making the performance very unpredictable.

Integrability,"This is done to better separate CUDA-specific code from the generic code; in RooBatchCompute. Two problems are addressed in this commit:. 1. The RooBatchCompute library had too many CUDA specific functions. The virtual RooBatchCompute interface should be backend agnostic, but; it had CUDA specific functions like `cudaMalloc()` and `cudaFree()`,; which where only implemented in the CUDA case. So an abstraction; didn't make much sense there. It's better to move the CUDA specifics; to a new `roofitcuda` library. Then, the functions from this library; are used in `batchcompute` and `roofitcore` behind preprocessor; macros when using CUDA. 2. Passing around `cudaStream_t` and `cudaEvent_t`. These types are only; available to `nvcc`, and in case gcc is used, these were forward; declared as stucts. This is a hack that should be avoided. In; particular, it can cause linker errors because the types are not the; same in the CUDA and C++ translation units. The proposed solution is to wrap the `cudaStream_t` and `cudaEvent_t`; pointers into C++ structs that are in the new CUDA support library,; and only when using `nvcc` it is allowed to unwrap these types. 3. Too specific signature of `RooAbsReal::computeBatch()`. This function; should not be too backend specific, but it took the `cudaStream_t`; directly. This parameter is removed. Now, the CUDA stream is stored; in a `RooBatchCompute::Config` struct that is passed around in the; `DataMap`.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13409:235,interface,interface,235,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13409,2,"['interface', 'wrap']","['interface', 'wrap']"

Integrability,"This issue is very case-dependent.; When trying to calculate memory usage, normally the actual free memory on the system is `free + buffer + cached `. If shared memory usage is high (e.g mmaping a big cache) the calculation is slightly different:; `(free + buffer/cache) - shared`. The author of **htop** mentions on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55090900/how-can-i-calculate-memory-utilisation-of-a-linux-server-using-sar-report) question that htop uses this convention(in 2016):. - Total used memory = MemTotal - MemFree; - Non cache/buffer memory = Total used memory - (Buffers + Cached memory). Now htop (managed by htop-dev) uses this (on https://github.com/htop-dev/htop/blob/main/linux/LinuxMachine.c#L210):. ```; const memory_t usedDiff = freeMem + cachedMem + sreclaimableMem + buffersMem;; host->usedMem = (totalMem >= usedDiff) ? totalMem - usedDiff : totalMem - freeMem;; ```. This issue intends to merge the total used memory to include cached instead of just free which isn't strictly a correct solution.

It is obviously correct - since if you use dynamic_cast and then do NOT check for nullptr and happily dereference the result, you can as well use a static_cast - if the old code was correct, the new one is correct as well.

Integrability,"This problem appears ""only"" in newer OS/compiler (as seen in the original reports leading to #12715) the dependent library are now dlclose'd when the 'main' library is dlclose'd. In the example a cmake generated library is linked against `libHist` and `libHist` is then loaded and unloaded when the example's library is (intentionally) loaded and unloaded. `libHist` happens to share a STL collection's dictionary (`std::vector<TString>`) with `libCore` (and this collection is used for the reading of rootpcm files and thus during the loading of the example's library). . Details:. Unload only the TClass actually generated by the unloaded library. The TGenericClassInfo's destructor now passes the TClass that they actually generated in; addition to the name so that only that TClass is destroyed. This avoid the problem (seen in #12715) where 2 librares (`A` and `B`) have a dictionary for the same; STL collection (this is supported) and we have the following sequence of operation:. 1. load library A; 2. load library B (dictionary registration is ignored as intended); 3. request TClass for STL collection.; 4. unload (dclose) library B; 5. use TClass for STL collection. With the previous code, step 4. would lead to the TClass for STL; collection to be marked as ""unloaded"" even though it library (A); was still actually loaded. Fix reloading of library with a module. Prior to this fix, the in-memory rootpcm loaded as part of the module was removed; from memory on first use and thus if the library was closed and re-opened/loaded; we no longer had the information needed to restore the TClass object corresponding; to that library.

In turn, `modifyClassWebpage.sh` depends on `libs.C` which is ACLiC'ed if to generate `libs_C.so` where required.; However, if `libs_C.so` does not exist, multiple processes might race to create it.

Integrability,"This pull request extends `RPageSink` to allow for vector commit of sealed pages.

These changes enable (parallel) vector writes in concrete backends, e.g. in DAOS. Derived classes that do not override the base implementation will see a sequence of calls to `CommitSealedPage()`. The first measurements of vector writes on DAOS based on this PR, indicate an improvement of _an order of magnitude_ in the write throughput. The refactor in this PR passes all the RPageSinkBuf tests. ## Changes or fixes:; - Add `CommitSealedPageV()` to the public interface of `RPageSink`. This function carries out a vector write of a number of sealed page ranges. Each range applies to a given columnId.; The default implementation of `CommitSealedPageVImpl()` sequentially calls `CommitSealedPageImpl()` for each page on each range, but derived classes can override it to provide an optimized implementation.; - Use `CommitSealedPageV()` in RPageSinkBuf. If a buffered column contains only sealed pages, commit the whole range; via `CommitSealedPageV()`.; - If all buffered columns consist solely of sealed pages, coalesce all pages to be committed in a single `CommitSealedPageV()` call that includes a sealed page range per column. ## Checklist:; - [X] tested changes locally; - [X] updated the docs (if necessary).

Integrability,"This pull request introduces RField support for user-defined classes that behave as collections of elements. These classes specify a ""collection proxy"" that provides access to the elements in the collection.; A legacy collection proxy is provided in the form of an instance of a class derived from `TVirtualCollectionProxy`. The collection proxy for a class is typically set during initialization, usually using `TClass::CopyCollectionProxy()` or similar. In this pull request, we introduce support for legacy collection proxies derived from the `TVirtualCollectionProxy` class, although in later stages, RNTuple might provide this functionality through an interface different interface. At a bare minimum, the user is required to provide an implementation for the following functions in `TVirtualCollectionProxy`:; - `HasPointers()`, `GetProperties()`, `GetValueClass()`, `GetType()`, `Sizeof()`: for general information about the collection and its value type.; - `Sizeof()`, `At()`, `Clear()`, and `Insert()`: for element access; - `PushProxy()`, `PopProxy()`: for selecting the target object.

Integrability,"This pull request provides a page allocator that caches previous allocations up to a certain limit. The cache is thread-local and defaults to 16 pages per thread (~1MiB per thread for default-sized pages). This PR is largely based on the concepts in #8634. Reuse of memory allocations in `RPageAllocatorCache` not only reduces calls to the global allocator but also heap fragmentation. The global allocator is thread-safe albeit locked; thus, to also reduce contention, the cache in `RPageAllocatorCache` is thread-local.; Given the small size of the (per-thread) cache, the internal structure is a simple `std::deque`. Anything more complex is not justified at the moment of this writing. . **NOTE:** Performance evaluation (specially for the multi-threaded case) should be inserted here tomorrow. ## Changes or fixes:; - Add `RPageAllocatorCache`: this templated allocator returns pages that have at least the required capacity. `DeletePage()` does not immediately deallocate memory; instead, pages are returned to a thread-local cache, dropping the smallest allocated buffer if the cache is full. If a previous page cannot be recycled, the underlying allocator `AllocT` (`RPageAllocatorHeap` by default) is used to allocate memory.; - Change the signature of `RPageSource::UnsealPage()`: `SealPage()`, the counterpart of `UnsealPage()` takes an RPage and returns an RSealedPage.
