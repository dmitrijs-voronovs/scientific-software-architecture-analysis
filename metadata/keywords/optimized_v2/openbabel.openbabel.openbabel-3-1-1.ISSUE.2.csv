Deployability,"I assume your note. > Well I can import babel in python now. relates to an eventual successful installation of openbabel with `pip install openbabel-wheel` from PyPI *instead* of the standard openbabel (and `pip install openbabel`) reported [here](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2018). *Possibly* your Python environment still contains some data by previous attempts to install standard openbabel. Because `openbabel-wheel` aims to fill the gap of standard `openbabel` with a setup as similar as standard openbabel would do (within reason), the Python interpreter plausibly has a hard time to identify the correct files; all while the *installation* of `openbabel` or `openbabel-wheel` is mutually exclusive. Recommendation: set up a virtual Python environment for your project; see Python's documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). With the virtual environment activated, install `pip install openbabel-wheel` only, then test your sample code. Once the work on your project is done, or the source code no longer is used by you, you can simply delete the folder containing the supporting virtual environment. This approach keeps your standard Python installation (outside the virtual environment) unaffected and easy to maintain. Notes:. - `pip list` will tabulate all pip installed Python packages.* The log is about the current environment used, i.e. if called while running the virtual environment, the listing is about the virtual environment only.; - as usual, you can remove a package by `pip uninstall name_of_the_package_to_remove`.; - use [pipreqs](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) to generate a `requirements.txt` file based on the `import` statements in your project. A future user of your work (which could be you) then can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to resolve the dependencies in a pristine virtual environment.

Deployability,"I have come across some potential issues with the way OpenBabel handles hydrogen (H2). In particular, InChI -> OBMol and OBMol -> SMILES appear to be incorrect.

Note that in the first case, SMILES -> OBMol -> SMILES does not match. The intermediate OBMol returns information that reflect the hydrogen molecule, as expected. Also note that in the second case, although InChI -> OBMol -> InChI appears to work, the intermediate OBMol returns information that reflect the hydrogen atom, not the hydrogen molecule.

Deployability,"I have only tested on OS X. The main thing I could see being an issue across platforms is using pkg-config to locate the Open Babel install. I added a fallback so if pkg-config fails, `/usr/local/` is guessed as the install location. If this is different across platforms, it should be possible to add some platform detection with alternative paths. I suspect this won't get a lot of use, considering it seems no one noticed setup.py has been broken for ages until Joshua fixed it a couple of weeks ago – I guess everyone just uses the cmake options when compiling. However this is useful for anyone who wants to install using pip and for virtualenv support. With regards to the name, the -python suffix seems uncommon on PyPI, seeing as by definition everything is python. If you are doing `pip install openbabel` you know you are getting python bindings.

Deployability,"I have the same problem with version 2.4.1 on Gentoo, reading output from GAMESS-US ver. 11 Nov 2017 (R3). I did some debugging and I found the problem to be in actual part of **gamessformat.cpp** that reads frequencies. Namely in line **515**, before reading reduced mass, it should also read SYMMETRY line:; ```; frequencies.push_back(atof(vs[i].c_str()));; }; ifs.getline(buffer, BUFF_SIZE); // reduced mass; ```; Fixed:; ```; frequencies.push_back(atof(vs[i].c_str()));; }; ifs.getline(buffer, BUFF_SIZE); // SYMMETRY; ifs.getline(buffer, BUFF_SIZE); // reduced mass; ```; otherwise lines **549-550** process a blank line instead of an atom - hence the segfault. Patch is attached that fixes the code. Here is a fragment of the GAMESS output where the problem appears:; > FREQUENCY: 2.93 1.88 0.55 0.35 0.16; > SYMMETRY: E E E E E; > REDUCED MASS: 6.79503 6.40438 13.42881 10.66293 9.71937; > IR INTENSITY: 0.23456 0.34034 0.01209 0.00004 0.00182. The second issue arises at the end of the loop that reads the modes (lines **582-584**):; ```; ifs.getline(buffer, BUFF_SIZE);; tokenize(vs, buffer);; modeCount = vs.size() - 3;; ```; At the end of the modes `buffer` variable contains empty string, so `vs.size()` returns 0. However, `modeCount` is defined as `unsigned int` (in line **544**):; ```; unsigned int modeCount = vs.size() - 3;; ```; therefore line **584** produces a huge positive value instead of -3, and the program does not leave the loop (condition in line **547**), leading to another segfault, which wasn't exposed due to the first one.

One should not just make a simple patch to switch a pkg-config arrangement. My guess is that whenever 4.0 comes out, the 100 projects (or whatever) will similarly need to make updates - and possibly significant ones.

Deployability,"I started to convert your `.sdf` test files into `.pdb` by `obabel -isdf <ligand_name>.sdf -opdb -O <ligand_name>.pdb` with Open Babel (version 3.1.0 in Linux Debian, I suggest you check if you equally may update to this) and displayed them pairwise in an elder installation of Jmol (14.6.4_2016.11.05). Only the conversion about `PEMETREXED_1.sdb` yielded a reasonable display of the `.pdb` with different atom colors for C, H, N, O. You know that Open Babel may read and write `.sdf` and `.pdb` files. I knew there are multiple ways an `.xyz` or a `.pdb` file may be written and occasionally -- just for the sake of consistency -- I use Open Babel to «correct» these prior to further processing. Thanks to your test files, I learn that this apparently equally is the case for `.sdf` files and I thus issued conversions in pattern of `obabel -isdf NATEGLINIDE_1.sdf -osdf -O NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.sdf` for both `NATEGLINIDE` and `PEMETREXED`, and then converted these by e.g., `obabel -isdf NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.sdf -opdb NATEGLINIDE_1_rewritten.pdb`. The visualizations by Jmol then look considerably better. Could such an edit equally be helpful for you?. The obvious question is about the difference between the original and the modified `.sdf` files. According to a difference view with `vimdiff` (an extension of the vim editor) or [meld](http://meldmerge.org/) (version 3.20.2) is that both the number of columns in the upper part of the connectivity table increase, as well as the connectivities are in part defined differently.

Deployability,"I was looking briefly at the logs from https://github.com/hackingmaterials/atomate/pull/734 and it seems like the problem is that when installing atomate via pip, it doesn't pick up the python-openbabel version installed earlier (the comment that it is due to system python vs virtual env is most likely correct). So instead it tries to install from pypi.; The 3.1.1.1 is the latest version of OpenBabel on pypi (https://pypi.org/project/openbabel/3.1.1.1/) that was created due to some packaging issue. If I recall correctly it's the same as 3.1.1 on most platforms.; I don't think the ""invalid version error"" is the real error, the problem is that it doesn't find the include files.; I haven't used packaged installs in a while but you might try to install libopenbabel-dev instead of python3-openbabel. I cannot remember if the dev files are included in the ""regular openbabel install"" but it's worth a try.; Otherwise we need to check if the folder `/usr/local/include/openbabel3` contains the missing files.

Deployability,"I've been reading up on charge equilibration methods, specifically the EQeq method by Wilmer et al. (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz3008485) and looking over the code in the supporting info (which was released in an addition to the original paper, https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz301439a). . I've noticed some inconsistencies with the implementation in both codes with the derivation provided in the supporting info. I'll focus on the Ewald implementation, as that's the one that I've been spending time on:. # Solving the Problem; The basis of the EQeq method is forming a system of equations and solving it with Householder or something equivalent. This system of equations aims to minimize all charges in the system, subject to the constraint that the system is charge neutral. I won't go into details of the method here, but it uses Lagrange multipliers and eventually solves a problem similar to `Ax = b` where `x` contains the charges in the system. . The main difficulty of this method is constructing `A`, but each entry contains a few terms, including Coulombic terms, idempotential and orbital overlap energy. # Orbital Overlap Energy; In the derivation Wilmer et al. talk about the orbital overlap energy term (or short-ranged damping term), which they define as. <a href=""https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=E_o(r_{ij})&space;=&space;\sum_m&space;\left(\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{J_{ij}r_{ij}}{K}&space;\right&space;)^2}&space;\left(\frac{J_{ij}}{K}&space;=&space;\frac{J_{ij}^2r_{ij}}{K^2}&space;-&space;\frac{1}{r_{ij}}&space;\right&space;)&space;\right&space;)"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E_o(r_{ij})&space;=&space;\sum_m&space;\left(\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{J_{ij}r_{ij}}{K}&space;\right&space;)^2}&space;\left(\frac{J_{ij}}{K}&space;=&space;\frac{J_{ij}^2r_{ij}}{K^2}&space;-&space;\frac{1}{r_{ij}}&space;\right&space;)&space;\right&space;)"" title=""E_o(r_{ij}) = \sum_m \left(\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{J_{ij}r_{ij}}{K} \right )^2",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1861:209,release,released,209,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1861,1,['release'],['released']

Deployability,"I've updated the patch, and updated the title of this patch to better reflect what it does. The problem was that OBConversion::Write() always set SetOneObjectOnly() so there was no way it could be used to generate CML output. The CML writer looked at Index and IsLast to see if it was a single-molecule or multi-molecule output. If the former, it wrote <molecule> element. If the latter it wrote a <cml> element containing 2 or more <molecule> elements. Another problem was that it needs to Index++ before calling WriteMolecule(), as that's the only way for the initialization code check (Index==1) to be correct *and* for GetOutputIndex() to reflect the number of molecules written. That in turn means that WriteFile() and WriteString() need to set Index=0 before calling Write(). In addition, I updated WriteString() so it saves/restores more state, and I added the new testobconversion_writers.py test program to the list of test cases for ""make test"". Finally, I include a 2-molecule CML test case, to ensure that it is possible to use the updated Writer API implementation to create the correct output.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1923#issuecomment-455598175:5,update,updated,5,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1923#issuecomment-455598175,6,"['patch', 'update']","['patch', 'updated']"

Deployability,"Just create the virtual environment (example for Linux Debian attached below); the isolated vessel of Python's standard library is available to you in a matter of a few seconds. I don't know how Python was installed to the computer you use (perhaps by an installer from python.org, maybe Winpython, maybe chocolately, maybe ...). It is possible other programs / utilities / the operating system (now) rely on Python; hence, the sudden removal of Python can unexpectedly hamper / corrupt the work elsewhere. *This* is a reason of the previous suggestion to simply set up a virtual environment (of Python) for your project because you know to eventually use some functionality outside the standard library & share a `requirements.txt` file. It equally helps you to build something in a reproducible way (share with a colleague, your script is written in partial fulfillment of a class, etc.). Regarding the GUI of openbabel: you don't have to use it. Like every GUI, the developers selected some functionality which now is presented in a hierarchy assumed to be logical and useful. If there is only one, or a few of structures to interconvert into an other file format, the GUI *can* be useful. The access from the CLI however is *more suitable* (or, the only reasonable way) to interact with openbabel to *pipe* and *tee* input, output, error streams with a script, or programs (grep, sed, awk; an other instance of openbabel; something written by you, etc.). In the case of a Debian based Linux operating system, for instance, the installation is modular: bindings to python, or the installation of the gui are optional (require an additional explicit opt-in) to `openbabel` and `libopenbabel7` for the executable to the CLI:. ![synaptic](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/assets/19709084/c40aa8e1-4551-4e89-8f44-d6fc35df2400).

Deployability,Logged In: YES ; user_id=1189615; Originator: NO. The main cause of this seems to be that the fragments.txt data file is not being found.; Setting the Environment Variable BABEL_DATADIR to the installation directory (this is C:\Program Files\OpenBabel-2.2.0 for me) seems to fix the problem. (Use Control Panel/System/Advanced/Environment Variables). What is going on needs further investigation since the current directory does not seem to be what I was expecting.

There is no equivalent on Windows systems. However; there may be a bableconfig.h already in the CVS.

Deployability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1444119; Originator: NO. This is a bug in the canonicalizer. The canonicalizer figures out the symmetry groups of the atoms without taking chirality into account, so any time there are two atoms that are identical except for their chirality, you'll get two possible ""canonical"" SMILES. Another instance of this is documented in the code, where a cis/trans configuration is incorrectly analyzed because, without taking chirality into account, it appears to be symmetrical and hence not cis or trans. In this case there is an axis of symmetry through a ring, and the only difference in the two halves of the ring are the two chiral centers themselves. So when the canonical-SMILES tree-generator reaches the ring, it has a choice between going left or right, and both paths appear identical, so it can generate two different canonical SMILES. The canonicalizer needs to add chirality to the atom-invarients *before* it starts analyzing chirality. However, even this is tricky, because sometimes a center can be chiral or achiral depending on the chirality of *other* atoms, leading to a sort of chicken-or-egg problem. Maybe a two-pass symmetry analysis is needed: First without chirality, then add in the chirality as new atom-invarients when a tie between two chiral atoms is discovered, and re-do the symmetry analysis.

Deployability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=1871725; Originator: NO. SMI format does not have it even in 2.2 release.; CAN format has it but the normalization procedure often makes it difficult to compare the resulting SMILES with the structure one wanted to generate - e.g. the directions ""in"" and ""out"" of the screen are often reversed etc. For complicated structures it is sometimes very non-trivial to check if the stereochemistry; has been correctly assigned.; The best option (for me) would be to have regular SMILES (not normalized to canonical format) reflect the stereoinformation conveyed by the OB_HASH_BOND and OB_WEDGE_BOND flags.

Deployability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=21420. I'd like to make sure porphyrin rings (metallated or not) and ; phthalocyanines are typed correctly for the 2.0 final release.

Deployability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=21420; Originator: NO. The ""audit log"" comments are more informative. The 2.1 version gives a quick summary of any warnings, errors, debugging information, etc. This way you can see if there were potential problems during conversion (or ignore if you like). The audit log keeps track of possible chemical transformations during conversion (e.g., creating bonds from a MOPAC file). The segmentation fault is fixed in the current SVN trunk. I'd be glad to give you an updated version or patch if you like. Obviously it should be fixed in 2.1.0 final release, which should come out in a week or three. The partial charges for MOPAC should be parsed correctly. But regular .mol files don't have partial charges as far as I know, so they aren't output. On the other hand, .mol2 files do, so you should seem them there. If not, please file another bug, or e-mail the mailing list.

Deployability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=850620; Originator: NO. I'm bumping up the priority as I've just spent an hour or two trying to figure out this problem myself, and it has also caused several bug reports to date. I suggest sorting this out in configure by adding some extra tests. Here is what I suggest:; (0) The user optionally sets BOOSTDIR. (1) If BOOSTDIR is defined, then add ""-DUSE_BOOST"" to DEFS, and ""-I$(BOOSTDIR)"" to INCLUDES. (2) configure should then try to compile a test program involving ""tr1/whatever"". If it succeeds, it sets a flag HAS_BOOSTLIKE_HEADERS. Otherwise, it prints a warning message saying ""It looks like you don't have the Boost headers so the following formats will not be compiled: chemdrawcdx, etc.. This is probably because you are using GCC3.x and don't have Boost installed. For more information, see http://openbabel.sf.net/Install (Source Code)"". (3) If HAS_BOOSTLIKE_HEADERS is not defined, don't compile any format that relies on the existence of Boost-like headers. (4) Update the documentation appropriately. I will do 4, and I can test 1-->3. (By the way, I note that although ./configure --includedir=whatever correctly sets includedir in the Makefile, the value of includedir does not seem to be incorporated into $INCLUDES.). Noel.

Deployability,"Logged In: YES ; user_id=850620; Originator: YES. I note that the conversion proceeds much better (perhaps even perfectly) if I first unset BABEL_DATADIR (on Windows). Setting BABEL_DATADIR is required for using FP3 from Python. However, something has gone wrong since the last release of OB and OBPython. It seems that OB cannot correctly read types.txt, nor patterns.txt, once you set BABEL_DATADIR. How do I know? Well, if I don't set BABEL_DATADIR, OB complains that it cannot find patterns.txt, but it correctly converts the MOL2 file in the Pybel test suite. If I set BABEL_DATADIR, it doesn't complain any longer about patterns.txt, but it cannot set any bits in the molecules (this exposed bug 1728410), nor can it correctly convert the MOL2 file in the Pybel test suite.

Deployability,"May you please clarify what represents for you a «3D builder»?. *Assuming* this refers to a program to set up a computation in a program like Gaussian, Gamess-UK, Games-US, etc. the state of a molecule as radical is described by the spin of the molecule, independent to assigning the molecule as neutral, or charged. As an example, [Avogadro](https://avogadro.cc/) may either read a normal closed-shell molecule (like methane) from a `.mol` or `.sdf` or one may build one from which e.g., hydrogens are removed. With optional extensions you may then export this as as starting point for quantum chemistry calculations as illustrated below:*. ![example_avogadro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/184554375-3077e7f3-932e-40dc-b8b7-cc81995097c0.gif). Some assignments of charges and multiplicities for CH3 above only serve as illustration that it can be set up yet it shows that you can discern between e.g., methyl cation, methyl carbanion, and methy radical. In this perspective, Avogadro trades similar to interfaces like [gabedit](http://gabedit.sourceforge.net/). ![gabedit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/184554505-6e69ed1e-432b-4771-9996-c4bf568f104d.png).

Deployability,"Maybe I am wrong, my speculation however is you would like to define by yourself which program should display the .svg generated Openbabel when running the GUI. I think the developers' choice for a web browser like Firefox was that these programs capable to display the .svg as an image rather than a text typically already are installed. Running Linux Debian 11 bullseye (branch testing) comprising both OpenBabel (version 3.1.0) as well as the graphical editor [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (version 1.0.2) I use successfully the «display only» program of the later, `inkview` to inspect a single .svg by. `inkview example.svg &`. or to browse through a collection of .svg in a folder by. `inkview *.svg &`. As mentioned earlier [here](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inbox/-/issues/3712#note_422339579), this works well for .svg generated by RDKit, but equally for .svg by OpenBabel. (For comparison, I attach reference data by both below.) Thus, if running `obgui` in Linux, I would welcome if it were possible to set a pointer like `/usr/bin/inkview %s` when instructing OpenBabel about which viewer to use. There are other programs to display .svg visually, too. Examples include [irfanview](https://www.irfanview.com/) if extended by the optional plugin; or [Xnview](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnviewmp/), and `display` of [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/index.php). However, these often rasterize the display of the image; by consequence, the benefits scaling a vector image (crisp representation) may be lost.

There were numerical instability in the way dihedral angles were calculated. The formula used relied on acos(x), which is ill-posed for several values of x.

It it is still valid, then the rdbuf needs to be replaced before deallocating pLineEndBuf. It is no longer valid, you can't do this. The correct solution is to install all filtering on top of the user provided stream. This could be done relatively easily as a general framework that would apply to the zlib filters (which I'm guessing, from looking at the code, also leak memory).

Deployability,"OpenBabel uses a number of global objects for performing various kinds of perception and these objects maintain state (mostly in the form of smarts patterns). This introduces race conditions in a multithreaded program that can result in segmentation faults. For example, if two instances of bond perception are called at the same time, one might zero out the match list in the smarts pattern while the other is reading it. . I have spent many hours trying to work around this probably by guarding calls with locks or parallelizing with processes instead of threads, but since perception routines are called as needed, it can be quite difficult to get right and it really shouldn't be necessary. Today I realized that making these global variables thread local should solve all these problems (and stop pharmit from crashing). **This means that openbabel needs to be compiled with -std=cx11.** This patch should gracefully degrade into the old buggy behaviour if this isn't an option. Note I may not have caught all the global objects that need this fix, but I think I at least got the ones with smarts patterns.

I decided against it because I didn't know if people called Write() multiple times with the same output file object, so wouldn't want a reset each time.

Deployability,"Point 3) might be similar to problems installing openbabel in a virtual environment to run (Python) scripts from the plain CLI. Either try. a) uninstall openbabel by `pip uninstall openbabel`. Then install openbabel-wheel[1] by `pip install openbabel-wheel` instead. This bypass usually fixes some of the problems, and works fine at least in Windows, and Linux. The only edit necessary would be to update the `requirements.txt` file if you amend your virtual environment this way, but not the the Python scripts itself. b) use `python3-openbabel` as packaged for your favorite Linux distribution (example [Debian](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/openbabel)), Windows + WSL environment. c) try a different ecosystem around your Python interpreter, for instance [Miniconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openbabel). It isn't necessary to give up standard [CPython](https://www.python.org/) for good -- there usually is no problem to have multiple interpreters on one computer. But it might require some adjustments on the side of the Jupyter notebook to engage the one you want to use.

Building openbabel 2.2.3 with gcc 4.3.3 on Tru64 requires two things:; (1) -D_GLIBCXX_USE_C99_MATH in CXX_FLAGS , e.g.; CXXFLAGS='-D_GLIBCXX_USE_C99_MATH -g -O2' ./configure; (2) whenever isfinite() is used, #include <cmah> is needed, there are too many of them; and I got fed up after adding the first couple, so I just added it to the end of src/config.h.in; (adding it to the end of include/openbabel/babelconfig.h also get included to everything). These steps are probably required for most older unix systems which is not linux nor Mac X.; (I'd like to know if either of these are needed on linux, actually, but can't be bothered, since openbabel is shipped with fedora). Also I have a comment to make: the top level INSTALL is misleading. since isfinite() is C99, the c89 part in; CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure; is misleading, and further more, most of openbabel is c++ code so the effective variables are really CXX and CXXFLAGS, not CC/CFLAGS .

Deployability,"So far, I used MOPAC's `.out` files for a conversion to, e.g., a `.pdb`; however, your suggestion to access the more compact `.arc` files instead of the former rises the question if your interest is for the coordinates, or / and (which?) of the parameters should be understood by openbabel. May you detail which ones are of interest for you?. One of the differences between the output files, beside the representation of the geometries (e.g., presence / absence of an atom number count), is `.arc`'s entry `HEAT OF FORMATION` which equates `.out`'s entry `FINAL HEAT OF FORMATION`. To ease your discussion with the developers, I add an archive including a MOPAC `.mop` input, as well as `.out` and `.arc` output files of a recent computation of mine.

Deployability,"Some OBChemTsfm transformations, especially on radicals, can result in unexpected implicit hydrogen counts since PR#1576. I wrote up an example failure in the first commit of this PR, where assigning a charge of -1 to an atom can give it 255 implicit hydrogens under certain conditions. I suspect the underlying cause is unsigned integer arithmetic in phmodel.cpp:321 (possibly also 343). Subtraction of two unsigned ints gives an unsigned int--if the difference would be negative, then the result is wrapped back to `UINT_MAX`, e.g. printing `(j->second - old_bond_order)` gives 4294967295 instead of -1. Then there's some truncation to fit in the unsigned char. But even if the overall expression gives the right answer most of the time, I think it would be clearer to be more explicit about the math, which would fix special cases like this bug. How should we adjust the line(s) of code in phmodel.cpp? We could explicitly typecast everything to a signed int then ensure that there are at least zero implicit hydrogens, but that seems verbose. @baoilleach Please feel free to directly commit on my PR if you have any ideas.

Deployability,"Sorry for the slow reply. It's not too much trouble to put a new 3.0 package onto PyPI. @e-kwsm has already done most of the hard work in updating the `setup.py` script in #2060. Someone just needs to run `python setup.py sdist` in the `scripts/python` directory, then upload the result with `twine`. However... there is a bug in the 3.0 release that means that the pip install process will fail to find the OB include directory. This has since been fixed (#2059, @e-kwsm again, thanks!) but I would recommend against uploading the sdist until this fix is released (in 3.0.1?), otherwise it will just break `pip install...` for everyone who hasn't compiled the latest master from source. Honestly, this is just the latest example of how unreliable it is to install via pip with a sdist that relies on pkgconfig to find OB and then run swig at install time.

I was (re-)installing OpenBabel into an environment module for the Canadian High Performance Computing infrastructure (Digital Research Alliance of Canada, formerly Compute Canada).

Deployability,Thanks for commenting @baoilleach :). As long as the functions are exposed (or there is another clever way to easily calculate what I need) then I see no problem with where things are stored in the C++ API. I used to use the `GetImplicitValence()` method on atoms in combination with `GetValence()` to figure out whether or not an atom needed to be given a hydrogen. Such a situation can arise if one needed to cut (in openbabel technically remove) a bond between a QM region and MM region with FragIt. I found an old blogpost of mine on the subject from almost 6 years ago (http://pythonchem.blogspot.dk/2012/01/adding-hydrogen-atoms-is-no-mean-feat.html) which explains it with a slightly different angle. The code I used has barely changed. The updated code (see https://github.com/FragIt/fragit-main/blob/develop/src/qmmm.py#L139) needs to know how many bonds really would like to be present and the following code apparently satisfies my testcases. Hope that explains how I used the old (and new) functionality.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1697#issuecomment-346318770:748,update,updated,748,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/1697#issuecomment-346318770,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"Thanks for pointing out that common Open Babel idiom. I had forgotten it. My patched doesn't touch Write(), only WriteString() and WriteFile().

This tells me two things: the CML format isn't designed to store multiple molecules, and Write() needs to increment the Index. I don't know how to handle the CML problem.

With this patch, different threads can safely use different instances of OBSmartsPattern to parse and match (this is not currently true do to the use of global variables) and different threads can use the same instance of an OBSmartsPattern to perform matching with a call to the stateless matcher. My opinion is that the old API should be deprecated to discourage non thread-safe coding. The original motivation for this patch was that most of the perception routines use smarts matching and so are not thread-safe. With this patch, they still aren't thread safe since they all need to be modified to call the stateless matcher. However, even with that additional modification they remain not thread-safe due to other data sharing issues that would require some thought and time to resolve well. I can provide a match that at least makes the smarts matching thread-safe is desired. Reported by: @dkoes.

Deployability,"The following can only cover some parts. Inferring from Linux Debian, Linux CentOS provides *some basic* support of Python; mainly to support the operating system itself. And if you perform a proper update of the operating system, then equally these supporting libraries are going to be updated. Now to your project. There is a set of modules deemed essential to Python; they constitute the Python standard library *every* Python installation includes, for instance `os`, `sys`, `argparse`. See for instance [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) and [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html). Additional functionality can be imported by additional libraries. One way to manage these *new dependencies* is by a `requirements.txt` file to list these modules -- preferably with indication of their (minimal) version known to work. For example. ```; CairoSVG>=2.7.1; openbabel-wheel>=3.1.1.16; rdkit>=2023.3.2; Requests>=2.31.0; ```. To keep the Python libraries which support your operating system in good shape, it is considered good practice to keep them separate (not accidentally modified) from packages used to develop and experiment with new packages. This is the background of using *virtual environments* which you. - first create, i.e. set up of a minimal clean Python environment; - second activate, i.e. to start using them; - third complement by additional Python packages (if needed) to provide additional functionality. *Here* the special file `requirements.txt` helps you because . ```shell; pip install -r ./requirements.txt; ```. is going to resolve the dependencies for you automatically. In case *virtual environments* is a concept new to you, Python documents it [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Real Python offers a free [primer](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) less technical if you prefer so.

Deployability,"The molecule contains an alias, which is part of the molecule and should not normally be ignored. OB can read these aliases if they are in data/superatom.txt , and CCl3 is. But the alias is attached to the C of a CH3 group, which leads to some interpretation difficulties, (I know of no specifications). The CCl3 could replace the CH3 (probably intended). Or could become a CCl3H3 group with heptavalent carbon (Marvin draws it this way). Or it could be ignored. Even though this is an erroneous molecule, it has shown up a bug in the alias expansion. The crash occurs in the 3D stereo code because the expanded atoms are wrongly given 3D coordinates in a 2D molecule. I will try to correct this before the next release. The 3D stereo code also could probably benefit from being more robust to erroneous input.

The primary use case is to support new elements where we don't yet have the symbol, but also to read SMILES written by OEChem/RDKit where *they* don't yet have the symbol.

Deployability,"The png format in OpenBabel does not make a png image. When writing, it just embeds a chemical file inside an existing png file. When reading, it exacts the chemical information in this form from a png file. Try babel -Hpng or the Format info in the GUI. The released versions of OpenBabel do not make images (other than povray). The development code (which will be eventually be in the next released version) contains 2-D depiction in svg (designed to display as an image in Firefox, etc.). A Beta Snapshot 2.2.99b1 of this code will be available on March 1 2010. It is likely that output to a wider range of image formats will come later. You might like to look at an on-line image service at http://depict.emolecules.com/ which is based on OpenBabel, but the image generation code I think is proprietary. InChIKey was not designed to be converted back to real chemical information. If you search for ""Inchikey resolver"" there are a number of services which I assume use database methods to associate an InChIKey with a molecule. I don't think OpenBabel will ever do this.; ; You could make a web converter, like the OASA one, for text output now and with images with the development code. I look forward to it!.

Deployability,"There are serious problems with the Java bindings. It took me quite a while to get them working in both Linux and Mac OS. In Windows 7 x64 I had no problems. I just needed openbabel_java.dll from the OpenBabelGUI package to be in java.library.path. Mac OS: I built the Java bindings using the instructions at [1] (including using Eigen2). However, it turns out that it is not sufficient to just place the resulting libopenbabel_java.so file in java.library.path. It needs to be renamed to libopenbabel_java.jnilib and the (advanced) instructions at [2] need to be followed because apparently there is some setup/compile glitch regarding where the compiled .so file will think its required library files are located. Linux: Using ""ld"" I could see that the glitch from above is also present in Linux. I did not find a tool similar to ""install_name_tool"" so instead I found out that I needed to follow the instructions in the Java README [3]. There is a typo (openbabel_java.cpp needs to be openbabel-java.cpp) and there will be complaining about a ""babelconfig.h"" file which I copied from the build directory created using CMake as described in [4]. In the end, the resulting libopenbabel_java.so file needs to be in java.library.path and I needed to do the LD_PRELOAD trick. To sum up, I think that there is room for improvement :) Thanks for your work so far!.

Deployability,"There are two separate problems here:. 1) The external build scripts for the Perl and Python bindings assume that libopenbabel will be in lib/, and they can't handle it if the library is instead in lib64/. CMake will put it in lib64/ if you tell it -DLIB_SUFFIX=64, which is the appropriate thing to do on a multilib system. . 2) The CMake build instructions for the Ruby bindings pass ""--with-openbabel-lib=${BABEL_LIBRARY}"" whereas what is wanted is ""--with-openbabel-lib=${CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}"". That is, the library name is passed instead of the library directory. The latter is particularly insidious. If there is a pre-existing libopenbabel in the linker's library search path then the ${BABEL_LIBRARY} version will find and link against that, thus (a) masking the error, and (b) possibly recording the wrong soname as a dependency of the Ruby bindings.

When adding or removing H (or when anything else changing the oder of the atom in the structure), the <NMREDATA_ASSIGNMENT> should be updated so that the reference to the atoms is updated. Doing this would allow the use of open babel for sdf files including NMR DATA. ** Request **; Do you think is is possible to include in babel a function that would update the <NMREDATA_ASSIGNMENT> tag when .sdf files with NMReDATA are identified ? It would be very usefull for the community building tools to manipulate these files. ** Example of relevant file **; The attached document is a typical file .sdf containing NMReDATA that would need addition of H before going ""3D"".

Instead of defaulting to a hybridization 2 kind of bond, if the builder doesn't think there is a reasonable bond vector, then the hydrogen isn't added.

This restores the old behavior of GetNewBondVector (return non-finite bond vectors), which is good in the off chance anyone was relying on it while still fixing the problem. In the corner case that a molecule has multiple conformers, some where the hydrogen can be added and some where it can't the hydrogen is added at (0,0,0), but I'm not sure this can actually happen.

Deployability,"This pull request implements a fragment-based coordinate generation method for Open Babel, which is a part of [my project at Google Summer of Code 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5029822145757184). # Method; 1. An input molecule is separated into fragments by cutting rotatable bonds. ; 2. If a fragment is in the fragment database which we prepared, the coordinates of atoms in the fragment were set according to the fragment information.; 3. Connect fragments and set coordinates of atoms which do not belong to any fragment.

It would, of course, be of greater convenience were the .xml document opened (from which any number of heuristics could detect it is of the PubChem schema) and the format determined automatically.

Deployability,"This was a ""feature"" when it was deliberately introduced about six years ago. I'm not sure that it is so dangerous that it needs over-hasty reaction just before a release. To have input and output files the same:; - on the command line, you have deliberately typed the same file name twice.; - on the GUI you have been warned when you entered the output file name.; - in a program or a script, and the names are not explicit, maybe the program should be more carefully constructed to avoid unwanted overwriting. There are legitimate uses for having the input and output files the same. Suppose you wanted to add a new molecule from a mol file to an existing cml file. obabel thecmlfile.cml extra.mol -O thecmlfile.cml. does this very nicely, without the tedious file deletion and renaming that would be necessary if you couldn't have the output and input the same. Editors of all kinds routinely read and write to the same file. OB is an editor sometimes: make the hydrogens explicit:. obabel file.mol -O file.mol -h. The command-line is not set up for interactivity; it has be an acceptance or a prohibition. I would favour acceptance. Chris.

If an atom does not have any class, the value of 0 is returned (instead of -9999); 2. Setting a value of zero removes the value; 3. It is not enforced, but the documentation now states that atom classes can only be positive integers in keeping with the Open Smiles spec (previously it was documented as allowing any integer).

Indeed, `-icml` in the instruction `obabel -icml aromatic_cml.txt -osmi` only was necessary because the input file *of .cml syntax* uses a non-conventional file extension for a .cml, namely `.txt`.

Specifically, this can be an issue if Cairo is installed using Homebrew on Mac OS X, which just relies on X11/XQuartz for some of its dependencies. This is a problem because /opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig/ is not visible to pkgconfig by default, so instead of returning the include and library paths for Cairo, pkgconfig just complains that dependencies are missing (even though they aren't).

I should point out that this problem could have been entirely avoided by using a tag that didn't depend on atom order, but rather was based on intrinsic properties of the SDF file format, for example, involving atom labels rather than atom orders.

Contrary to your report, I did not observe any error report at all. I then read the `.sdf` in an old instance of Jmol (14.6.4_2016.11.05), the viewer recognized the presence of four models. It was possible to display them one by one (on Jmol's console, this requires an input in pattern of `load ""OUT.sdf"" 1`) and the geometries do not look terribly skewed either. Equally, there was no problem to import the `.sdf`import into [DataWarrior](http://openmolecules.org/datawarrior/index.html) (version 5.2.1, 2020) to write a `.dwar` file either.

I am still wondering about what should happen in cases where the element symbol and the atomic number don't agree. I have a couple of molden files where this is the case because the atomic number is reduced by the number of cored electrons. So far, Open Babel uses the atomic number and disregards the element symbol, which caused converted geometries to have mostly wrong elements.

So your report obabel in iOS would trade better than Debian is worth to note for those with access to both operating systems. Maybe the SMILES was derived from a .sdf already problematic?. Because I'm not aware (yet) of a checker for SMILES in regard of consistency (like for Python [online](https://www.online-ide.com/online_python_syntax_checker), or `pylint` for the CLI; or [checkcif](http://checkcif.iucr.org/) for crystal structure data; or the CIP validator by Hanson et al. ([2018JChemInfModel1755](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00324))), the mentioned cdk-depict sometimes serves me to spot a (potentially) problematic SMILES string: enter e.g., `CC=CC` and the wavy bond indicates the configuration of the double bound is not defined. With the optional display of CIP labels, there equally will be an explicit question mark; this contrasts to `C\C=C\C`, `C\C=C/C`, `C/C=C\C`, and `C/C=C/C`:. ![butene_variations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/203751096-2be1d298-3c71-4a57-acc2-8098cb449534.png). Regarding the second part: thankfully, obabel is equally available as a `.deb` package *prêt-à-porter*/ready to go (Debian's [tracker](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/openbabel)). There might be a delta in time and functionality between the executables either compiled from the source code here (GitHub), and the one *via* the repositories of DebiChem. With Debian *branch testing* (at present, Debian 12/bookworm) one may consider more like a *rolling release* (comparison to Debian stable, or LTS releases in the Ubuntu family), I do not perceive the delays as problematic.

Deployability,"at happens instead of the expected behavior -->; <!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->; The installer drops its files and registry values in locations specific to the user account under which context the installer was run. To illustrate with an example scenario: a user is logged in interactively with a standard user account named 'Bob' with SID `S-1-5-21-1234`. The user downloads and runs the installer and is prompted to enter admin credentials so the user authenticates with an account named 'Admin' with SID `S-1-5-21-1000`. The installer finishes successfully but the user doesn't see OpenBabel in the Apps list in Windows Settings (alt. Programs and Features in Control Panel) or any shortcuts in their Start Menu; they log out from Bob and log in as Admin to find both there. The files and registry key are incorrectly in places specific for the account which was used to elevate the privileges of the installer (Admin in this example), not for the user which had interactively executed the installer (Bob in this example) or for all users on the computer (see the **Expected Behavior** section above).; - Shortcuts in `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\OpenBabel 3.1.1`; - Miscellaneous program data (docs, examples etc.) in `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\OpenBabel-3.1.1`; - Uninstall registry key to `\HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-1000\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\OpenBabel-3.1.1`.

I removed these, and removed `-Wl,--no-undefined`, and it works fine on Linux and macosx, but I need some help on Windows. (maybe link with `libpython*.a` instead). 2. I use [cmake-build-extension](https://github.com/diegoferigo/cmake-build-extension) to build the cmake project through `pip`. It works fine.

I'm pretty sure that mmcif requires a whitespace in these cases. The behvior is the same for Open Babel 2.2.2b1 -- Jun 2 2009 -- 12:15:39 (from Avogadro package) as for Open Babel 2.2.1 -- Mar 1 2009 -- 19:20:41 (latest release package from sourceforge). The input pdb file was created from mmcif using babel. (Please note: This is important for me because I want to setup a transformation flow for my mmcif based application using some pdb based transforms and Open Babel. My application parser (Rutgers cifparse-obj-v7.025) reads complete mmcif and doesn't simply ignore those lines as e.g. pymol seems to do.) .

Deployability,"cript below performs a conversion explicitly requesting both standard output as well as the error stream. For unproblematic SMILES (i.e., entries reporting back with two lines [or line-feed separated records, in parlance of AWK]) the canonical SMILES string is provided. Though written for Linux Debian 12/bookworm (branch testing), by use of AWK, this approach aims to be portable for other platforms (maybe others may check on this). Reporting only the (processed) canonical SMILES passing the filter successfully equally should be helpful when running OpenBabel with the optional `--errorlevel <N>` (default 2 out of 5, cf. [section 3.2](https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Command-line_tools/babel.html)). ```awk; #!/usr/bin/awk -f. # name: filter.awk; # author: nbehrnd@yahoo.com; # license: GPL v2, 2022; # date: <2022-03-23 Wed>; # edit: <2022-03-28 Mon>. # Retain ""reasonable"" SMILES strings OpenBabel may process gently.; #; # For a successful application of this filter, this AWK script depends; # on a running installation of OpenBabel and AWK. (Tests suggest you may; # use GNU AWK/gawk and nawk instead of AWK as well.); #; # Write a list of SMILES into the same directory as this AWK script, e.g.,; # as file check01.smi. Then deploy this filter e.g., by; #; # awk -f filter.awk check01.smi; #; # to process the content of the list of SMILES. The output is a list of; # canonical SMILES which OpenBabel has no difficulty to process.

The user downloads and runs the installer and is prompted to enter admin credentials so the user authenticates with an account named 'Admin' with SID `S-1-5-21-1000`. The installer finishes successfully but the user doesn't see OpenBabel in the Apps list in Windows Settings (alt. Programs and Features in Control Panel) or any shortcuts in their Start Menu; they log out from Bob and log in as Admin to find both there.

Deployability,"ip install openbabel`) reported [here](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2018). *Possibly* your Python environment still contains some data by previous attempts to install standard openbabel. Because `openbabel-wheel` aims to fill the gap of standard `openbabel` with a setup as similar as standard openbabel would do (within reason), the Python interpreter plausibly has a hard time to identify the correct files; all while the *installation* of `openbabel` or `openbabel-wheel` is mutually exclusive. Recommendation: set up a virtual Python environment for your project; see Python's documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). With the virtual environment activated, install `pip install openbabel-wheel` only, then test your sample code. Once the work on your project is done, or the source code no longer is used by you, you can simply delete the folder containing the supporting virtual environment. This approach keeps your standard Python installation (outside the virtual environment) unaffected and easy to maintain. Notes:. - `pip list` will tabulate all pip installed Python packages.* The log is about the current environment used, i.e. if called while running the virtual environment, the listing is about the virtual environment only.; - as usual, you can remove a package by `pip uninstall name_of_the_package_to_remove`.; - use [pipreqs](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) to generate a `requirements.txt` file based on the `import` statements in your project. A future user of your work (which could be you) then can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to resolve the dependencies in a pristine virtual environment. (This package typically ships with [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/); by now you know how to check/install the package if necessary.). \* The more explicit `python3 -m pip list` typically is necessary only if the computer used equally (still / intentionally) includes an instance of Python2.

This could be called a user error, since the installer probably tells me to close all other applications and whatnot, but it has been years since I've seen an installer spontaneously rebooting my machine without first asking me. If I may offer a suggestion: there is a flag /norestart for executing the installation of the redistributable libraries. Using this flag should prevent the spontaneous reboot. But it may then be necessary to tell the user to reboot their computer manually, which is of course also not ideal. ## Steps to Reproduce; <!--; If the problem occurs with a particular file, please either upload and attach the file or include a link here - this greatly improves our ability to test your problem.; Please include screenshots or text output if they help illustrate a behavior.; -->; Install the Windows",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2313:1277,install,installation,1277,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2313,1,['install'],['installation']

Deployability,"ivities in this example is larger, than in your example of the carbene complex. However, Gold Book equally features an entry coordination[2b] with the statement. «The synonym 'dative bond' is obsolete. (The origin of the bonding electrons has by itself no bearing on the character of the bond formed. Thus, the formation of methyl chloride from a methyl cation and a chloride ion involves coordination; the resultant bond obviously differs in no way from the C–Cl bond in methyl chloride formed by any other path, e.g. by colligation of a methyl radical and a chlorine atom.)». which is more similar to your argument ""use a plain line"". I don't know why then IUPAC's Gold Book (still) retains an entry about dative bonds. The test site of ChemDraw JS[3] -- which should be the easiest for the owner to update (once CambridgeSoft -- Brecher's affiliation 2008 -- meanwhile acquired by Perkin), uses dative bonds and again the arrow. A query of PubChem for ZnPc[4] yields a 2D model which does not deploy arrows to the more electropositive metal, but instead dotted lines.

Deployability,"nbabel`) reported [here](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2018). *Possibly* your Python environment still contains some data by previous attempts to install standard openbabel. Because `openbabel-wheel` aims to fill the gap of standard `openbabel` with a setup as similar as standard openbabel would do (within reason), the Python interpreter plausibly has a hard time to identify the correct files; all while the *installation* of `openbabel` or `openbabel-wheel` is mutually exclusive. Recommendation: set up a virtual Python environment for your project; see Python's documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). With the virtual environment activated, install `pip install openbabel-wheel` only, then test your sample code. Once the work on your project is done, or the source code no longer is used by you, you can simply delete the folder containing the supporting virtual environment. This approach keeps your standard Python installation (outside the virtual environment) unaffected and easy to maintain. Notes:. - `pip list` will tabulate all pip installed Python packages.* The log is about the current environment used, i.e. if called while running the virtual environment, the listing is about the virtual environment only.; - as usual, you can remove a package by `pip uninstall name_of_the_package_to_remove`.; - use [pipreqs](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) to generate a `requirements.txt` file based on the `import` statements in your project. A future user of your work (which could be you) then can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to resolve the dependencies in a pristine virtual environment. (This package typically ships with [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/); by now you know how to check/install the package if necessary.). \* The more explicit `python3 -m pip list` typically is necessary only if the computer used equally (still / intentionally) includes an instance of Python2. This however is more and more an exception.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2402#issuecomment-1792940138:1314,install,installed,1314,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2402#issuecomment-1792940138,6,['install'],"['install', 'installed']"

Deployability,"nds the error. Fixed by checking the input atoms before expanding the unit cell in `FillUnitCell` (maybe this kind of check belongs somewhere else?). **Issue 2:** `OBUnitCell::FillUnitCell` hangs on large unit cells. This is due to the algorithm used in atom checking. It checks atom-atom distances, which is O(N^2). The new approach uses a hash, which should be amortized O(N). It uses the extra speed to check _every_ atom for uniqueness, rather than just symmetry unique ones. Note that a better approach would use an octree, but the hash was easier to implement and proves the point. **Issue 3:** `OBUnitCell::FillUnitCell` doesn't check all possible duplicates. To replicate, use [FeMOF74](https://gist.github.com/patrickfuller/6419438) and the above script. The underlying issue is that `FillUnitCell` assumes that the listed symmetry operations are logical. However, CIFs are a mess. In the case of the example cif, the file already has more than one unitcell worth of atoms, and additionally has defined symmetry operations. This is solved by the solution of Issue 2; by using the extra speed afforded by the hash to check every atom-atom connection, we can check for more duplicates. **Issue 4:** Some crystallographic programs fail if atom coordinates are not in [0, 1]. It's annoying, but an easy fix. I just added `WrapFractionalCoordinate` to cifformat.cpp. **Issue 5:** Centering can segfault. To replicate, use CoMOF74. ``` python; import pybel; with open(""CoMOF74.cif"") as in_file:; mof = in_file.read(); mol = pybel.readstring(""cif"", mof); mol.unitcell.FillUnitCell(mol.OBMol); # Cycling fixes the issue; # mol = pybel.readstring(""cif"", mol.write(""cif"")); mol.OBMol.Center(); mol.write(""cif""); ```. The `Center()` method operates off of a bunch of private variables. I'm guessing something isn't getting updated when `FillUnitCell` is called, but I couldn't figure out what it was. I'll look into this one again, but I'd appreciate any pointers in the mean time! **EDIT** Fixed this.",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/23:2580,update,updated,2580,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/23,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"oggle on/off the virtual environment differ of each other. The advantage of this development *separate* from the libraries used by your operating system: you don't harm your OS. If you are stuck in an error, deactivate the virtual environment, delete the whole folder of this virtual environment, and start all over from scratch. Obviously, for your project, you have to identify and use *your project's* `requirements.txt`. If there is no `requirements.txt`, get in touch with the author of the application. Else, set up a virtual environment, activate it and install [pipreqs](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/) to quickly generate a `requirements.txt` about all non-standard Python modules your project requires. *But:* `pipreqs` does not know about openbabel-wheel -- which is why a manual edit in `requirements.txt` is necessary. Try then if your application can be started and used as described by its documentation. An aspect specific point to `openbabel` (from pypi.org) and `openbabel-wheels` (from pypi.org): `openbabel-wheels` as a bypass aims to install where normally `openbabel` would be. In case you already installed `openbabel` in your virtual environment, you then must deinstall `openbabel` (by the command `pip remove openbabel`) in first place before an installation of `openbabel-wheel` is successful. Last but not least I see your `cmake` command. If you work with *an activated* virtual environment of Python, the address of the python interpreter is different from the usually used one. (Of course, because you do not want to harm your operating system.) So your command. ```shell; which python; ```. which *normally* points to `/usr/bin/python`* now (again, in the working/activated *virtual environment* of Python) points to a different location of your python interpreter within your virtual environment. Edit your command accordingly and use the address of the interpreter within the active virtual environment. \* which might be itself a symbolic link to the interpreter",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2659#issuecomment-1860654034:3015,install,install,3015,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2659#issuecomment-1860654034,3,['install'],"['install', 'installation', 'installed']"

Debian 12/bookworm (branch testing) occasionally is ahead of Ubuntu when it comes to programs the DebiChem project repackages. In the case of OpenBabel, this is the case ([tracker](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/openbabel)) with version 3.1.1 available since June 2021. So I once removed all packages related to OpenBabel, and started from scratch with the combination of `sudo apt-get install openbabel python3-openbabel`. Then again, OpenBabel from the CLI as well from within Python are installed without warning, and work as anticipated:. ```; norwid@carnot2:~$ lsb_release -a; No LSB modules are available.; Distributor ID:	Debian; Description:	Debian GNU/Linux bookworm/sid; Release:	testing; Codename:	bookworm; norwid@carnot2:~$ ; norwid@carnot2:~$ obj; objcopy objdump ; norwid@carnot2:~$ obj; objcopy objdump ; norwid@carnot2:~$ python pip uninstall openbabel; python: can't open file '/home/norwid/pip': [Errno 2] No such file or directory; norwid@carnot2:~$ python3 pip uninstall openbabel; python3: can't open file '/home/norwid/pip': [Errno 2] No such file or directory; norwid@carnot2:~$ ; norwid@carnot2:~$ # get OpenBabel; norwid@carnot2:~$ ; norwid@carnot2:~$ sudo apt-get install openbabel python3-openbabel; [sudo] password for norwid: ; Reading package lists...

I expected this to occur silently, and maybe having to reboot my computer afterwards. ## Actual Behavior; <!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->; <!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->; The installation of the Visual C++ redistributable libraries occurred silently, but then my machine rebooted, terminating all applications that I had open. This could be called a user error, since the installer probably tells me to close all other applications and whatnot, but it has been years since I've seen an installer spontaneously rebooting my machine without first asking me. If I may offer a suggestion: there is a flag /norestart for executing the installation of the redistributable libraries. Using this flag should prevent the spontaneous reboot. But it may then be necessary to tell the user to reboot their computer manually, which is of course also not ideal. ## Steps to Reproduce; <!--; If the problem occurs with a particular file, please either upload and attach the file or include a link here - this greatly improves our ability to test your problem.; Please include screenshots or text output if they help illustrate a behavior.; -->; Install the Windows version of Open Babel on a computer that does not yet have the version of the Visual C++ redistributable libraries that comes with the installer.",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2313:1474,install,installer,1474,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2313,5,"['Install', 'install']","['Install', 'installation', 'installer']"

Deployability,"ps""); Segmentation fault; ```. ### Example 2 (actual); ```; >>> import openbabel as ob; >>> conv = ob.OBConversion(); >>> conv.SetInAndOutFormats(""smi"", ""fps""); True; >>> mol = ob.OBMol(); >>> conv.ReadString(mol, ""C""); True; >>> conv.WriteString(mol); Segmentation fault; ```; (Replace the WriteString() with the WriteFile() and there is still a segmentation fault.). The problem seems to be that WriteString() and WriteFile() on a newly constructed OBConversion() leave the Index at the initial value of 0. Some of the formats use GetOutputIndex() and, if it is 1, perform an initialization. For the FPS format, the initialization loads the correct fingerprint type. If it is uninitialized then it will deference an unassigned variable, causing the segfault. I have patched WriteString() and WriteFile(). I will submit a pull request shortly to demonstrate one possible solution. ## Related symptoms. ### issue #1783. Note that this is likely related to issue #1783 . With an un-patched system:; ```; >>> import pybel; >>> pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""c1ccccc1"").write(""fpt""); '>\n'; ```. with my patch in place:; ```; >>> import pybel; >>> print(pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""c1ccccc1"").write(""fpt"")); > 6 bits set; 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000200 00000000 00000000; 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000840 00000000 00008000; 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000; 00000000 00000000 00000000 08000000 00000000 00000000; 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00020000; 00000000 00000000; ```. The proposed solution in that issue was to enable the 'h' option, which worked because the relevant code sets hexoutput using the following.; ```; if(pConv->IsOption(""h"") || (pConv->GetOutputIndex()==1 && pConv->IsLast())); hexoutput=true;; ```. It may also be related to issue #852 . ### CML output.

Deployability,"recognize what type of SMILES string is offered to; you. In this perspective, I perceive OpenBabel as advantageous in; comparison to ChemDraw because with toggles like `-osmi` or `-ocan`; you may explicitly define which «dialect» the SMILES will be (e.g.,; canonical, universal, inchified). Like with any programs, as soon as you interface with other programs,; the lack of convention (or deployment of programs designed to adhere; different conventions), this may be anything in the spectrum of; «below the detection limit», «nuisance», and «incompatible». Say you; successfully load the structure in the JS of ChemDraw mentioned; earlier and request the interface to provide the SMILES string. You; may feed this string into OpenBabel in a pattern like. ```bash; obabel -:""c1ccncc1"" -osmi; ```. to ask OpenBabel for a SMILES representation (here about pyridine,; just substitute the SMILES string from ChemDraw accordingly). Here,; `-osmi` and `-ocan` yield the same SMILES string. With a molecule; more complex, like the cyclic one of yours, however, you are going to; recognize differences how input vs. output may differ, and how; different output options yield different SMILES generated by; OpenBabel, too. I don't know what you intend to do with the SMILES strings in hand.; Given observations like the ones mentioned above, I however notice my; tendency to withdraw from them and to deploy either InChI (for the; description and recreation of the structures), or InChIKey (their; hashes, for a convenient recognition of identity of two entries). For reasons beyond your initial question, I currently use one of the; handy reference implementations available for free (as in free beer); from the InChI trust.[1] These are compiled to run from the get-go; with 32 or 64 bit (either Windows or Linux, no separate Mac version); from the CLI to perform the assignment on (multi-model) .sdf files.; OpenBabel equally offers an interface to these two formats. https://www.inchi-trust.org/downloads/",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2416#issuecomment-941186358:1479,deploy,deploy,1479,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2416#issuecomment-941186358,1,['deploy'],['deploy']

Deployability,"s are contained within that; install. I used conda-forge to install openbabel v3.1.0 and subsequently; pybel. The error output I sent was from Windows v2004 and I sent that one; because MACOS just said ""segmentation fault"". I figured the Windows output; was a little more useful. Both were generated from the same script. Both; scripts included:; from openbabel import openbabel; from openbabel import pybel; However, there is information I didn't include. These errors come about; after compiling with pyinstaller but the program works before compiling. I; didn't include this information originally because I can reproduce the; errors with the interpreter and simple code. Best,; Mike.

OpenBabel however issues a warning/error _interpreted_ as serious enough to remove this entry for good:. ```bash; $ obabel -:""CC(O/C(\CCC[C@H]([C@H](C(CC=C)=C)OC(O)=C)O)=C(\COC)/OCO)=O"" -ocan; ==============================; *** Open Babel Warning in CreateCisTrans; Error in cis/trans stereochemistry specified for the double bond.

The meaning of the formulae provided by CDKDepict[2] did not alter -- e.g., no change in the configuration of the stereogenic centers, and the double bond still can't be assigned to match either the pattern of (E), or (Z):. ![2022-03-30_CDKDepict_entry04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/160856599-8123cc0e-39b3-44b7-a2be-019bf7d5294b.png). Because I'm not aware if OpenBabel can resolve such ambiguities (here: to return one SMILES string with the explicit (E), and an other SMILES string with the explicit (Z) double bond) -- wouldn't be the more strict (pedantic?) remove of this entry an; advantage to address specific configurations?*. Last (but not least), the explicit return of problematic SMILES. The in-silico generation of molecules as SMILES appeared to me as affordable (enough) to skip entries with SMILES OpenBabel/partialsmiles perceive as problematic. Thus my change to focus on SMILES approved by partialsmiles/OpenBabel may process (the complementary set). The above SMILES string yielding a warning because of extended stereochemistry (options for .and. and .or.) equally calls for an adjustment of the parameters how the molecules are generated (outside OpenBabel) to use only SMILES with unambiguous stereochemistry. ---. *) On a tangent, this reminds me a bit to the extended stereochemistry options in .sdf (v3000 format) with logical .and. and .or. as seen e.g., in a presentation[3] by Andrey Yerin's about how to possibly improve InChI:. ![2022-03-30_Yerin_InChI]",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2455#issuecomment-1083218256:1787,configurat,configurations,1787,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2455#issuecomment-1083218256,1,['configurat'],['configurations']

I get the same crash and location using 3 different Java VM's. The JVM installs and runtimes are solid and I verified that the the JVM's libs were picked up for each OpenBabel build. I have verified each JVM does work with other JNI libraries I have written. I tried using the standard JVM flags: -verbose:jni and the Oracle specific JVM flags: -Xcheck:jni and -Xint (ie. don't use HotSpot) but got same results and didn't see any obvious issues logged before the crash. The attached pidXXX.log has details about the crash. I have done a full JVM core dump for these crashes but analysis so far has not helped since the JVM is dying early in the native lib loading.

Deployability,"t.; I tried to compile the OpenBabel source code myself under Visual Studio 2022. After downloading OpenBabel v3.1.1 from Github, I first downloaded the following optional libs and successfully compiled them all with CMake (libxml2, InChI, zlib, Eigen3, RapidJSON, wxWidgets and Cairo). After setting various paths for optional libraries in CMake, I was able to successfully configure and generate OpenBabel in CMake and open it in Visual Studio 2022. The project was also able to be compiled (Release) in Visual Studio without any errors. I then created a new console project and configured various paths for the include and .lib files of OpenBabel for it.; Here is the short console programm I found in the net:. ```. #include <openbabel/obconversion.h>; #include <openbabel/mol.h>; #include <iostream>. using namespace std;; using namespace OpenBabel;. int main() {; // SMILES string; string smiles = ""CCO"";. // Create an OBMol object; OBMol mol;; OBConversion conv;; conv.SetInFormat(""smi"");; conv.ReadString(&mol, smiles);. // Get IUPAC name; string iupac_name = mol.GetTitle();. // Output IUPAC name; cout << ""IUPAC name: "" << iupac_name << endl;. return 0;; }; ```. But when I tried to compile this console project, the following errors were displayed:; ```; Error (active) E0020 The identifier """"strcasecmp"""" is not defined. OpenBable C:\Libs\OpenBabel\v3.1.1\install\include\openbabel3\openbabel\plugin.h 44; Error C3861 ""strcasecmp"": Identifier not found. OpenBable C:\Libs\OpenBabel\v3.1.1\install\include\openbabel3\openbabel\plugin.h 44; ```. I know that ""strcasecmp"" is not included in the C standard, but only in POSIX.; I'm now wondering how I can fix this error? Did I make a mistake when compiling OpenBabel?. ## Environment Information; Open Babel version: v3.1.1; Used optional Libs: libxml2, InChI, zlib, Eigen3, RapidJSON, Cairo, wxWidgets; Operating system and version: Windows 11 Pro x64; Compiler: Visual Studio C++ 2022; CMake GUI v3.28.1.

However, after building, the openbabel module then fails to import in anaconda python, causing it to to crash:. ```~~~; $> ipython; Python 2.7.6 |Anaconda 1.9.1 (x86_64)| (default, Jan 10 2014, 11:23:15) ; [...]. In [1]: import openbabel; Fatal Python error: PyThreadState_Get: no current thread; Abort trap: 6 ; ```~~~. It seems something is wrong with the way the _openbabel.so file in the python extensions is linked:. ```~~~; $> otool -L _openbabel.so ; _openbabel.so:; 	libpython2.7.dylib (compatibility version 2.7.0, current version 2.7.0) ; 	/Users/ms/openbabel/installation/lib/libopenbabel.4.dylib (compatibility version 4.0.0, current version 4.0.0); 	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1197.1.1); 	/usr/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.2.5); 	/usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 120.0.0); ```~~~. Note that libpython2.7.dylib does not explicitely point to the anaconda python lib, but instead is specified as a simple file name. I suppose this causes the dynamic linker to use the system python lib at runtime. The system lib is from python 2.7.5, while anaconda comes with 2.7.6. The version mismatch is most likely responsible for the crash. . This mismatch can be fixed using install_name_tool to explicitely set the full path to the python lib:. ```~~~; install_name_tool -change libpython2.7.dylib /Users/ms/anaconda/lib/libpython2.7.dylib _openbabel.so; ```~~~. With this treatment, the import in anaconda python succeeds without error.

(intentionally stopped by `Ctrl + C`, hence the `^C`) still displays the obstacle. So your report obabel in iOS would trade better than Debian is worth to note for those with access to both operating systems. Maybe the SMILES was derived from a .sdf already problematic?. Because I'm not aware (yet) of a checker for SMILES in regard of consistency (like for Python [online](https://www.online-ide.com/online_python_syntax_checker), or `pylint` for the CLI; or [checkcif](http://checkcif.iucr.org/) for crystal structure data; or the CIP validator by Hanson et al. ([2018JChemInfModel1755](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00324))), the mentioned cdk-depict sometimes serves me to spot a (potentially) problematic SMILES string: enter e.g., `CC=CC` and the wavy bond indicates the configuration of the double bound is not defined. With the optional display of CIP labels, there equally will be an explicit question mark; this contrasts to `C\C=C\C`, `C\C=C/C`, `C/C=C\C`, and `C/C=C/C`:. ![butene_variations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19709084/203751096-2be1d298-3c71-4a57-acc2-8098cb449534.png). Regarding the second part: thankfully, obabel is equally available as a `.deb` package *prêt-à-porter*/ready to go (Debian's [tracker](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/openbabel)). There might be a delta in time and functionality between the executables either compiled from the source code here (GitHub), and the one *via* the repositories of DebiChem. With Debian *branch testing* (at present, Debian 12/bookworm) one may consider more like a *rolling release* (comparison to Debian stable, or LTS releases in the Ubuntu family), I do not perceive the delays as problematic. After preparing a package, improvements unrelated to security stay in the purgatory of Debian's branch *unstable* (or sid) for about 5 days; if accepted, they then percolate into *testing*.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2317#issuecomment-1326200644:2499,rolling,rolling,2499,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2317#issuecomment-1326200644,3,"['release', 'rolling']","['release', 'releases', 'rolling']"

Deployability,"ual Behavior. The above code on the current Open Babel HEAD (and with 2.4.1) causes segmentation faults:. ## Steps to Reproduce. ### Example 1 (actual); ```; >>> import pybel; >>> pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""C"").write(""fps""); Segmentation fault; ```. ### Example 2 (actual); ```; >>> import openbabel as ob; >>> conv = ob.OBConversion(); >>> conv.SetInAndOutFormats(""smi"", ""fps""); True; >>> mol = ob.OBMol(); >>> conv.ReadString(mol, ""C""); True; >>> conv.WriteString(mol); Segmentation fault; ```; (Replace the WriteString() with the WriteFile() and there is still a segmentation fault.). The problem seems to be that WriteString() and WriteFile() on a newly constructed OBConversion() leave the Index at the initial value of 0. Some of the formats use GetOutputIndex() and, if it is 1, perform an initialization. For the FPS format, the initialization loads the correct fingerprint type. If it is uninitialized then it will deference an unassigned variable, causing the segfault. I have patched WriteString() and WriteFile(). I will submit a pull request shortly to demonstrate one possible solution. ## Related symptoms. ### issue #1783. Note that this is likely related to issue #1783 .

Deployability,"ull request!. Where needed and if possible, we’ve adjusted the configuration to the needs of your particular repository. But of course, you should feel free to tweak it further! Check [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#editing-a-code-scanning-workflow) for detailed documentation. Questions? Check out the FAQ below!. ### FAQ; <details>; <summary>Click here to expand the FAQ section</summary>. #### How often will the code scanning analysis run?; By default, code scanning will trigger a scan with the CodeQL engine on the following events:; * On every pull request — to flag up potential security problems for you to investigate before merging a PR.; * On every push to your default branch and other protected branches — this keeps the analysis results on your repository’s *Security* tab up to date.; * Once a week at a fixed time — to make sure you benefit from the latest updated security analysis even when no code was committed or PRs were opened. #### What will this cost?; Nothing! The CodeQL engine will run inside GitHub Actions, making use of your [unlimited free compute minutes for public repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#about-billing-for-github-actions). #### What types of problems does CodeQL find?; The CodeQL engine that powers GitHub code scanning is the exact same engine that powers LGTM.com. The exact set of rules has been tweaked slightly, but you should see almost exactly the same types of alerts as you were used to on LGTM.com: we’ve enabled the [`security-and-quality` query suite](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#using-queries-in-ql-packs) for you. #### How do I upgrade my CodeQL engine?; No need!

The user downloads and runs the installer and is prompted to enter admin credentials so the user authenticates with an account named 'Admin' with SID `S-1-5-21-1000`. The installer finishes successfully but the user doesn't see OpenBabel in the Apps list in Windows Settings (alt. Programs and Features in Control Panel) or any shortcuts in their Start Menu; they log out from Bob and log in as Admin to find both there. The files and registry key are incorrectly in places specific for the account which was used to elevate the privileges of the installer (Admin in this example), not for the user which had interactively executed the installer (Bob in this example) or for all users on the computer (see the **Expected Behavior** section above).; - Shortcuts in `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\OpenBabel 3.1.1`; - Miscellaneous program data (docs, examples etc.) in `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\OpenBabel-3.1.1`; - Uninstall registry key to `\HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-1000\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\OpenBabel-3.1.1`.

Energy Efficiency," ### FAQ; <details>; <summary>Click here to expand the FAQ section</summary>. #### How often will the code scanning analysis run?; By default, code scanning will trigger a scan with the CodeQL engine on the following events:; * On every pull request — to flag up potential security problems for you to investigate before merging a PR.; * On every push to your default branch and other protected branches — this keeps the analysis results on your repository’s *Security* tab up to date.; * Once a week at a fixed time — to make sure you benefit from the latest updated security analysis even when no code was committed or PRs were opened. #### What will this cost?; Nothing! The CodeQL engine will run inside GitHub Actions, making use of your [unlimited free compute minutes for public repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#about-billing-for-github-actions). #### What types of problems does CodeQL find?; The CodeQL engine that powers GitHub code scanning is the exact same engine that powers LGTM.com. The exact set of rules has been tweaked slightly, but you should see almost exactly the same types of alerts as you were used to on LGTM.com: we’ve enabled the [`security-and-quality` query suite](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#using-queries-in-ql-packs) for you. #### How do I upgrade my CodeQL engine?; No need! New versions of the CodeQL analysis are constantly deployed on GitHub.com; your repository will automatically benefit from the most recently released version. #### The analysis doesn’t seem to be working; If you get an error in GitHub Actions that indicates that CodeQL wasn’t able to analyze your code, please [follow the instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/troubleshooting-the-codeql-workflow)",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/2546:2759,power,powers,2759,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/pull/2546,2,['power'],['powers']

Energy Efficiency," 3.1.1). The correct sum formula results from 2x CH3 at the periphery, 2x H in the flanking carbene moieties, and three H in the central pyridine ring (two meta and one para H). Somehow, OpenBabel ""hallucinates"" an additional implict hydrogen, which is a serious bug, as was first discovered in Chemotion, which relies on OpenBabel:. https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/issues/1551. With the aid of conversion of molfile to the ""molreport"" format, this ""surplus H"" can be traced down to the following parts of the output:. Apparently, OpenBabel breaks three of the four bonds the platinum has towards the pyridine N, the two carbene C and the bromido ligand, only retaining one of the two Pt-C(carbene) bonds, as there is only one bond involving the Pt atom #17:. ATOM: 3 C TYPE: C2 HYB: 2 CHARGE: 0.0000; ATOM: 4 N TYPE: N2 HYB: 2 CHARGE: 0.5000; ATOM: 8 N TYPE: Npl HYB: 2 CHARGE: 0.5000; ATOM: 10 N TYPE: Npl HYB: 2 CHARGE: 0.0000; ATOM: 12 N TYPE: Npl HYB: 2 CHARGE: 0.5000; ATOM: 15 N TYPE: Npl HYB: 2 CHARGE: 0.0000; ATOM: 17 Pt TYPE: Pt HYB: 3 CHARGE: 0.0000; ATOM: 20 Br TYPE: Br HYB: 1 CHARGE: 0.0000; BOND: 17 START: 3 END: 12 ORDER: 1. This in turn seems to traces back to Pt assigned HYB: 3 (hybridization?!?) combined with a Pt charge of +1, which leads it to be allowed only one bond above the ""standard valence"" of two. This, in turn, results in a ""lonely"" Br which is ""fixed"" by adding a H to the Br, as is evident from the InChI also generated by OpenBabel:. InChI=1S/C13H13N5.BrH.F6P.Pt/c1-15-6-8-17(10-15)12-4-3-5-13(14-12)18-9-7-16(2)11-18;;1-7(2,3,4,5)6;/h3-9H,1-2H3;1H;;/q;;-1;+1 . Therefore, the origin of this bug is the incorrect breaking of some metal-ligand bonds although they are marked as regular single bonds in the molfile:. 20 17 1 0 0 0. As this leads not only to an incorrect sum formula but if the sum formula is further processed, also to incorrect molecular weight and thus incorrect yield, for example in Chemotion, it is considered a critical bug.

Energy Efficiency," Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS. Expected Behavior:. Hi,. I would like to know if you can explain to me why the partial charges apparently are compued using the forcefield GAFF instead of gasteiger? And also is there a way to know what openbabel uses to compute the partial charges?. I put some python codes below as an example. . ```; from openbabel import pybel; from pandas import pd. df2 = pd.read_csv('pdb_data.csv'); pdb_file = df2['0'].values[0]; mol = pybel.readstring(""pdb"", pdb_file). # Orginal charges; original_charges = []; for atom in pybel.ob.OBMolAtomIter(mol.OBMol):; original_charges.append(atom.GetPartialCharge()). # Check charges compued with gasteiger; ob_charge_model = pybel.ob.OBChargeModel.FindType(""gasteiger""); ob_charge_model.ComputeCharges(mol.OBMol); gasteiger_charges = ob_charge_model.GetPartialCharges(). # Check charges compued with gaff; forcefield = pybel.ob.OBForceField.FindForceField(""GAFF""); forcefield.Setup(mol.OBMol); forcefield.GetAtomTypes(mol.OBMol); forcefield.GetPartialCharges(mol.OBMol); gaff_charges = []; for atom in pybel.ob.OBMolAtomIter(mol.OBMol):; gaff_charges.append(atom.GetData(""FFPartialCharge"").GetValue()). print(""idx original Charges gasteiger_charges gaff_charges""); for i in range(len(original_charges)):; print(i,original_charges[i],gasteiger_charges[i],gaff_charges[i]); ```. The results are:. ```; dx original Charges gasteiger_charges gaff_charges ; 0 0.2273575586270756 0.44768947025350836 0.227358 ; 1 0.05350466388437878 0.07149693567273824 0.0535047 ; 2 0.2617664055801697 0.16055301754336238 0.261766 ; 3 -0.2695948639211467 -0.3698152931377961 -0.269595 ; 4 0.003951938318300501 -0.016021135211386303 0.00395194 ; 5 -0.0076351463869480905 -0.00030001658256236435 -0.00763515; 6 0.04195789057969603 0.022817331577072122 0.0419579; 7 -0.5498178330382764 -0.5705799217846154 -0.549818; 8 -0.5498178330382764 -0.5705799217846154 -0.549818; 9 -0.29903160746872914 -0.28749424285870157 -0.299032; .; .; .; ```.

The calculated energy for the `--gen3d` option was lower than that for the `--gen3d best` option. I've tested this with a few molecules and so far either the commands produce the same energy or the energy from the default option is lower than that of the ""best"" option.

Energy Efficiency," specifically the EQeq method by Wilmer et al. (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz3008485) and looking over the code in the supporting info (which was released in an addition to the original paper, https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz301439a). . I've noticed some inconsistencies with the implementation in both codes with the derivation provided in the supporting info. I'll focus on the Ewald implementation, as that's the one that I've been spending time on:. # Solving the Problem; The basis of the EQeq method is forming a system of equations and solving it with Householder or something equivalent. This system of equations aims to minimize all charges in the system, subject to the constraint that the system is charge neutral. I won't go into details of the method here, but it uses Lagrange multipliers and eventually solves a problem similar to `Ax = b` where `x` contains the charges in the system. . The main difficulty of this method is constructing `A`, but each entry contains a few terms, including Coulombic terms, idempotential and orbital overlap energy. # Orbital Overlap Energy; In the derivation Wilmer et al. talk about the orbital overlap energy term (or short-ranged damping term), which they define as. <a href=""https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=E_o(r_{ij})&space;=&space;\sum_m&space;\left(\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{J_{ij}r_{ij}}{K}&space;\right&space;)^2}&space;\left(\frac{J_{ij}}{K}&space;=&space;\frac{J_{ij}^2r_{ij}}{K^2}&space;-&space;\frac{1}{r_{ij}}&space;\right&space;)&space;\right&space;)"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E_o(r_{ij})&space;=&space;\sum_m&space;\left(\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{J_{ij}r_{ij}}{K}&space;\right&space;)^2}&space;\left(\frac{J_{ij}}{K}&space;=&space;\frac{J_{ij}^2r_{ij}}{K^2}&space;-&space;\frac{1}{r_{ij}}&space;\right&space;)&space;\right&space;)"" title=""E_o(r_{ij}) = \sum_m \left(\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{J_{ij}r_{ij}}{K} \right )^2} \left(\frac{J_{ij}}{K} = \frac{J_{ij}^2r_{ij}}{K^2",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1861:1127,energy,energy,1127,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1861,1,['energy'],['energy']

Energy Efficiency,"(Part of the pre-3.0 API cleanup); The current situation is that some molecular perception flags have an unset method. Others do not. Furthermore, some setters take a boolean for set/unset (full disclosure - this may have been all me). The latter approach of a single method with a boolean seems reasonable. It reduces the number of methods, reduces the developer error (forgetting to add an unset method), and frankly is easier for users - just one method to do two things. . This PR gets rid of the Unset methods for molecule flag perception, and ensures that all setters (for perception flags) take a boolean. I've also moved HasFlag and SetFlag from ""protected"" to ""public"". I get the idea of encapsulation, but consider the case where the user wants to set a custom flag.

Energy Efficiency,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**. The submission of a container file, i.e. a `.smi` or a `.sdf` with multiple records to prepare a stack of input files e.g. ```shell; obabel input.sdf -O run.mop -xk ""pm3 charge=0 eps=4.8 cycles=200"" -m; ```. yields the input for the next program to use. Openbabel reports back to the CLI in a pattern of. ```shell; 275 molecules converted; 275 files output. The first is run1.mop; ```. The pattern of the file name of the new files written however is varying within each of submission. In the present case, for instance, there is `run1.mop`, `run3.mop` (one digit), `run36.mop` (two digits), `run123.mop` (three digits), etc. named in sequence of the entry in the original (container) file processed. **Describe the solution you'd like**. I would like to see a name pattern which accounts for the number of records and -- where necessary -- pads the number assigned with leading zeroes. In the present case, this would name the same files as above `run001.mop`, `run003.mop`, `run036.mop`, `run123.mop` with three digits each. Second, it can be informative to just know the number of records the container file contains. As an illustration of the first point, MOPAC issues a brief note to the CLI about a computation completed, for instance. ```shell; MOPAC Job: ""run239.mop"" ended normally on Oct 27, 2023, at 13:14.; ```. With the pattern scheme newly suggested, the submission of a batch of computations to MOPAC by. ```shell; find *.mop | parallel -j 4 mopac {}; ```. then would provide an easier to read (low level) monitor about the advance of the local computations in queue. Though *completion* of the individual computation (by MOPAC) naturally will interfere a little bit and is outside of obabel's control, it is the pick of next job from the deck in question which follows a numeric sort. **Describe alternatives you've considered**.

With [ChemDrawJS](https://chemdrawdirect.perkinelmer.cloud/js/sample/index.html#), I created `.mol` files about the methyl cation, methyl radical, and methyl carbanion. Because ChemDraw's export is implicit about the hydrogen atoms, I run . ```shell; $ obabel input.mol -h --gen3d -O output.mol; ```. to yield files with explicit hydrogen atoms instead. Then however I wonder. For one, to process . ```bash; $ obabel *.mol -ocan; [CH3-]	methyl carbanion; [CH3+]	methyl cation; [CH3]	methyl radical; 3 molecules converted; ```. yields the SMILES strings in the anticipated pattern. Submitting such a list by. ```bash; $ obabel smiles_list.smi -omol; ```. however regenerates an entry about the methyl radical where `M RAD 1 1 2` *is missing* while `M CHG 1 1 -1` about the carbanion and `M CHG 1 1 1` about the carbcation are rewritten. **Describe alternatives you've considered**; So far, I did not identify an alternative. **Additional context**; The test data processed are attached in the .zip archive below.

Energy Efficiency,"- [ ] I believe this to be a bug with Open Babel; - [x] This is a feature request. ## Environment Information; Open Babel version: 2.4.1; Operating system and version: all. ---; There was a recent interesting paper about the ""Sobering Assessment of Small-Molecule Force Field; Methods for Low Energy Conformer Predictions""(https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1705/1705.04308.pdf) . So I was trying to utilize that information from the paper above and instead of using MMFF94 I optimized my MOPAC file containing 1000 structures with openmopac PM7 and basically had a mopac output file (*.out *.arc) with a 1000 optimized PM7 structures. Now in order to utilized them further in my pipeline I needed to convert them from MOPAC output format (*.out *.arc) back to SDF. With the current OpenBabel GUI which i mostly use it only converts one single file, but not multiple MOPAC optimized structures. Would it be possible to integrate such a feature or is that rather something one would do outside with a small tools (similar to SDF2SMI) or maybe there is already a tool or some python code?.

Energy Efficiency,"- [x ] I believe this to be a bug with Open Babel. ## Environment Information; Open Babel version: 3.1.1; Operating system and version: Windows 10 (20H2). ## Expected Behavior; Expect that a peptide sequence provided in FASTA format will be converted to SMILES, as reported in the supplement to the paper by Iwaniak, A., Minkiewicz, P., Darewicz, M., Sieniawski, K., & Starowicz, P. (2016). BIOPEP database of sensory peptides and amino acids. Food Research International, 85, 155-161. doi: 10.1016/j.foodres.2016.04.031). ## Actual Behavior; As also reported by shahik and fredrikw in issue ""smiles to fasta conversion"" #2359, the peptide sequence is converted to a nonsense open SMILES. For example the following input:. `>Test ARFF`; `ARFF`. produces the following SMILES output (either in the output pane or the GUI or in a file) :. `[H].[N].[C].[C].[O].[C].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[N].[C].[C].[O].[C].[C].[C].[N].[C].[N].[N].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[N].[C].[C].[O].[C].[C].[C].[C].[C].[C].[C].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[N].[C].[C].[O].[C].[C].[C].[C].[C].[C].[C].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[H].[O].[H]`. However, **IF** the 'Display in firefox' option is enabled before doing the conversion, then the output is instead:. `N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)N[C@H](C(=O)O)Cc1ccccc1)Cc1ccccc1)CCCNC(=[NH2])N)C`. which creates the correct peptide structure when pasted into Marvin Sketch. Also, by default OpenBabel expects the FASTA to contain nucleotide sequences not amino acid sequences, so the input:. `>Test AR`; `AR`. produces the output:. `O[P@@](=O)([O])OC[C@H]1O[C@H](C[C@@H]1O[P@@](=O)([O])OC[C@H]1O[C]([C][C]1O)N1[C]=NC2=[C]N=C([N])N=C12)n1cnc2c(N)ncnc12.O[P@@](=O)([O])OC[C@H]1O[C@H](C[C@@H]1O[P@@](=O)([O])OC[C@H]1O[C@H](C[C@@H]1O)n1c(=O)[nH]c(=O)c(C)c1)N1C(=O)N=[C][C]=C1`. which does not represent the required peptide. I couldn't see any way to make OpenBabel treat the input FASTA as a peptide sequence, although it may exist.

I previously reported a possible bug related to the aromatic ring perception algorithm (issue 1920). But, as it was not the only case I found, I decided to perform a broader evaluation of other ligands while using PDB files and to report all the issues at once. The result of this analysis is in the attachment. As previously, I noticed that OpenBabel 2.3.2 generated a correct output for the molecule I was analyzing, then I also decide to use this version in my tests. In all tests, I used the openbabel 2.4.1 library (python) for creating an OBMol molecule and then I printed the smiles for each one of the inputs (listed below). To check for possible errors of valence, charge, etc, I used the tool Chemicalize from Chemaxon (the figures in the attachment were obtained with this tool). First, I extract the ligand from the PDB file (all ligands and ids were informed in the attached file). Four different inputs were used to create the OBMol object:; 1) A .mol file obtained by converting the extracted file using OpenBabel 2.3.2.; 2) A .mol file obtained by converting the extracted file using OpenBabel 2.4.1. ; 3) The .pdb file. Function used: readfile(""pdb"", file); 4) The .pdb file as a string. Function used: readstring(""pdb"", pdb_block). Besides it, for each ligand I also evaluated the impact of creating the molecule without hydrogens and adding hydrogens according to some pH value. In the excel file, you'll find a column with the ligand information, one to indicate if I had used hydrogens and other to inform at which pH the hydrogens were added. Also, four other columns were added (one for each input). The red cells indicate if there is an incorrect aromatic perception. I believe these results can help you guys to detect what are the possible causes for these errors.

Energy Efficiency,"- [x] I believe this to be a bug with Open Babel; - [ ] This is a feature request. ## Environment Information; Open Babel version: 3.1.1; Operating system and version: Ubuntu 18.04. ## Expected Behavior; PDB files do not support implicit hydrogens. Every atom is required to be explicitly listed in the file. When Open Babel reads a PDB file, it incorrectly adds implicit hydrogens, which lead to a cascade of other errors in chemical perception. The PDB file below contains a positively charged HIS residue. This is the dominant form below pH 6. The correct way to interpret it is to include exactly the atoms shown and no others, and to place a +1 formal charge on either ND1 or NE2. ## Actual Behavior; Open Babel incorrect places an implicit hydrogen on CE1. That leads it to incorrectly perceive a single bond rather than a double bond between ND1 and CE1, and to not place a charge on either nitrogen. ## Steps to Reproduce; ```; HETATM 1 C ACE A 1 0.069 -0.698 -0.007 1.00 0.00 C ; HETATM 2 O ACE A 1 0.145 -1.672 -0.738 1.00 0.00 O ; HETATM 3 CH3 ACE A 1 -1.215 -0.397 0.736 1.00 0.00 C ; HETATM 4 H1 ACE A 1 -1.457 0.659 0.633 1.00 0.00 H ; HETATM 5 H2 ACE A 1 -1.108 -0.655 1.787 1.00 0.00 H ; HETATM 6 H3 ACE A 1 -2.021 -0.987 0.300 1.00 0.00 H ; ATOM 7 N HIS A 2 1.170 0.011 0.231 1.00 0.00 N ; ATOM 8 H HIS A 2 1.937 -0.166 -0.407 1.00 0.00 H ; ATOM 9 CA HIS A 2 1.517 0.669 1.503 1.00 0.00 C ; ATOM 10 HA HIS A 2 0.617 0.883 2.080 1.00 0.00 H ; ATOM 11 CB HIS A 2 2.412 -0.293 2.326 1.00 0.00 C ; ATOM 12 HB2 HIS A 2 3.361 -0.417 1.799 1.00 0.00 H ; ATOM 13 HB3 HIS A 2 2.649 0.188 3.278 1.00 0.00 H ; ATOM 14 C HIS A 2 2.219 2.028 1.309 1.00 0.00 C ; ATOM 15 O HIS A 2 2.833 2.531 2.242 1.00 0.00 O ; ATOM 16 CG HIS A 2 1.857 -1.677 2.626 1.00 0.00 C ; ATOM 17 ND1 HIS A 2 1.497 -2.661 1.712 1.00 0.00 N ; ATOM 18 HD1 HIS A 2 1.453 -2.545 0.698 1.00 0.00 H ; ATOM 19 CE1 HIS A 2 1.093 -3.749 2.396 1.00 0.00 C ; ATOM 20 HE1 HIS A 2 0.726 -4.672 1.950 1.00 0.00 H ; ATOM 21 NE2 HIS A 2 1",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2411:488,charge,charged,488,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2411,3,['charge'],"['charge', 'charged']"

Ideally, it would simply skip over the UNITY_ATOM_ATTR section and move onto the BOND section. One workaround is to use `-xu` to suppress writing formal charge information to the file, but then it is not a complete mol2 file. ## Actual Behavior; Antechamber replicates the last atom read 3 times (for 3 lines in the UNITY_ATOM_ATTR section). This has been brought up on the Amber mailing list (http://archive.ambermd.org/202103/0308.html), and is definitely a deficiency in the way Amber reads mol2 files.

Starting in line 50, the moderator script includes a `try/except ValueError` clause:. ```python; try:; rdkit.Chem.rdDetermineBonds.DetermineBonds(mol, charge=args.charge); print(Chem.MolToMolBlock(mol)); except ValueError:; print(; ""The attributed global charge by `-c` is incompatible with bond orders assigned.""; ); ```. The (now explicitly assumed) overall neutral molecule. ```shell; $ python xyz2mol_b.py structure.xyz --charge 0; ```. yields the data for a .sdf where as for exemple a net single negative the moderator reports. ```shell; $ python xyz2mol_b.py structure.xyz -c -1; The attributed global charge by `-c` is incompatible with bond orders assigned.; ```. Non-integer charges are barred from entry altogether (by `formatter_class=argparse.ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter` in line 24, and more importantly, `type=int,` in line 36). ```shell; $ python xyz2mol_b.py structure.xyz -c 0.4; usage: xyz2mol_b.py [-h] [-c int] FILE; xyz2mol_b.py: error: argument -c/--charge: invalid int value: '0.4'; ```. With these elements in place, one can imagine some iterations. A first guess of a shell script for Debian's bash, if one has to check a single .xyz only:. ```shell; for i in {-5..5}; do; echo ""$i""; python ./xyz2mol_b.py ./structure.xyz -c ""$i"" > out_""$i"".sdf; done; ```. which can shortened further as the moderator script contains an adjustable shebang.

Energy Efficiency,"13BrF6N5PPt (using the stand-alone OpenBabel 3.1.1). The correct sum formula results from 2x CH3 at the periphery, 2x H in the flanking carbene moieties, and three H in the central pyridine ring (two meta and one para H). Somehow, OpenBabel ""hallucinates"" an additional implict hydrogen, which is a serious bug, as was first discovered in Chemotion, which relies on OpenBabel:. https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN/issues/1551. With the aid of conversion of molfile to the ""molreport"" format, this ""surplus H"" can be traced down to the following parts of the output:. Apparently, OpenBabel breaks three of the four bonds the platinum has towards the pyridine N, the two carbene C and the bromido ligand, only retaining one of the two Pt-C(carbene) bonds, as there is only one bond involving the Pt atom #17:.

This in turn seems to traces back to Pt assigned HYB: 3 (hybridization?!?) combined with a Pt charge of +1, which leads it to be allowed only one bond above the ""standard valence"" of two. This, in turn, results in a ""lonely"" Br which is ""fixed"" by adding a H to the Br, as is evident from the InChI also generated by OpenBabel:. InChI=1S/C13H13N5.BrH.F6P.Pt/c1-15-6-8-17(10-15)12-4-3-5-13(14-12)18-9-7-16(2)11-18;;1-7(2,3,4,5)6;/h3-9H,1-2H3;1H;;/q;;-1;+1 .

Therefore, the origin of this bug is the incorrect breaking of some metal-ligand bonds although they are marked as regular single bonds in the molfile:. 20 17 1 0 0 0. As this leads not only to an incorrect sum formula but if the sum formula is further processed, also to incorrect molecular weight and thus incorrect yield, for example in Chemotion, it is considered a critical bug.

I would like to know if it was possible to force the internal OBMol copy in OBForceField to have the same partial charges as defined in mol2 file? And also the same for the atom types (that are of course also defined in GAFF)?. I put some python codes below as an example. That's how far I can go... Also I am not restricted to Python only. The solution can be also in C++ (if there is one). Thanks for your help!. Jerome. ## Actual Behavior; The partial charges (and Atom types) contained in the internal OBMol of OBForceField are different from the input file. ## Steps to Reproduce; Molecule file (to rename in .mol2): [molecule.txt](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/files/3888996/molecule.txt). ```python; from openbabel import openbabel as ob. obconv = ob.OBConversion(); obconv.SetInFormat(""mol2""); OBMol = ob.OBMol(); obconv.ReadFile(OBMol, ""molecule.mol2""). # Force OB to keep them?; OBMol.SetPartialChargesPerceived(); OBMol.SetAutomaticPartialCharge(False); OBMol.SetAutomaticFormalCharge(False). forcefield = ob.OBForceField.FindForceField(""GAFF""); forcefield.Setup(OBMol). forcefield.SetLogLevel(ob.OBFF_LOGLVL_HIGH); forcefield.SetLogToStdErr(); force",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2096:945,charge,charges,945,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2096,1,['charge'],['charges']

This will also be the standard in the latest upcoming IUPAC InChI recommendations on organometallics. Furthermore, ""dative"" bonds have no relevancy at least in coordination and organometallic chemistry of the d- and f-elements - all those bonds are more or less polar covalent bonds. The best solution would actually for atoms and bonds to be marked with an attribute ""don't touch"" in terms of bond order and addition of implicit hydrogens and M-L ""lines"" simply be taken as an indication of a bonding interaction without any implication on the electron count.

Energy Efficiency,"> If I grab a PDB file from RCSB, there are no explicit hydrogens:. It depends how the structure was generated. If it was determined with crystallography, there won't be any hydrogens because they can't be resolved from the electron density. If it's an NMR structure, it probably will include hydrogens. > How about this heuristic.. if the PDB file already has hydrogens, the default should be to assume all hydrogens are explicit?. That seems reasonable. Adding hydrogens to proteins needs to be done very carefully though. A lot of side chains are charged, so you don't want to just automatically fill in a hydrogen everywhere one could possibly go. And of course it depends on pH. Even if you assume you're only interested in pH 7, there still can be ambiguity. HIS has two forms that are equally common at pH 7, with the hydrogen on either ND1 or NE2. If one of the two is able to form a hydrogen bond, that stabilizes it, so you want to look at potential bonding partners to select which is more likely. In the example above, the file already has a hydrogen on CE1, and it adds a second one. That doesn't match any common form at any pH. So I guess there are three parts to the solution. 1. Provide an option for whether to add hydrogens.; 2. The default value for that option should depend on whether the file already has any hydrogens.; 3. Check the logic it uses for adding hydrogens, since there appear to currently be some cases where it creates unrealistic, nonphysical structures.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2411#issuecomment-920439796:550,charge,charged,550,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2411#issuecomment-920439796,1,['charge'],['charged']

The (now explicitly assumed) overall neutral molecule. ```shell; $ python xyz2mol_b.py structure.xyz --charge 0; ```. yields the data for a .sdf where as for exemple a net single negative the moderator reports. ```shell; $ python xyz2mol_b.py structure.xyz -c -1; The attributed global charge by `-c` is incompatible with bond orders assigned.; ```. Non-integer charges are barred from entry altogether (by `formatter_class=argparse.ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter` in line 24, and more importantly, `type=int,` in line 36). ```shell; $ python xyz2mol_b.py structure.xyz -c 0.4; usage: xyz2mol_b.py [-h] [-c int] FILE; xyz2mol_b.py: error: argument -c/--charge: invalid int value: '0.4'; ```.

Energy Efficiency,"@RaphaelRobidas Contrasting to the mandatory Hill formula, the charge layer only is added to the InChI if the underlying structure is charged. The automatic charge recognition is embedded in the algorithm to yield the standard InChI. To best of my knowledge, this is not a parameter InChI trust's reference executables currently (version 1.6 by December 2021) offer to toggle off/relax as they do for the perception of stereochemistry. (And if engaged, this no longer yields the standard InChI `1S/...`, but one non-standard InChI `1/...`. Well, one .or. multiple options may be engaged simultaneously to yield *a* non-standard InChI; so *standard* is *agreed convention*.). On the other hand, there is ongoing development of InChI /per se/ as well as of applications engaging InChI.

Energy Efficiency,"@baoilleach - please see example below. The only trick to let MOPAC calculate multiple molecules in a single file, is to separate multiple molecules by an empty line CR/LF. . @ghutchis - thank you, its great to read something like this, especially for people bit outside the field like me. MMFF94 is just so embedded in the minds, and DFT on 1000 molecules is still too far away, but PM7 runs literally in seconds, so really doable (besides all the conversion issues). For docking one could also use PM6-D3H4 which is a bit more accurate and maybe COSMO if needed. The general workflow I use is; 1) SMILES to 3D SDF (add H and generate MMFF94 low energy conformer); 2) 3D SDF to XYZ (XYZ needed for input in other tools or DFT calculations); 3) XYZ to MOPAC cartesian (need to add MOPAC keywords and single CR/LF separator); 4) MOPAC ARC/OUT to optimized SDF (needed for pipeline and additional handling). Now one can process 100k molecules in a single file and then parse the output like; IP, HOMO, LUMO, COSMO volume, pkA and other values. Best would be of course; to have all the calculated properties added as SDF fields but that is another story.; (One could use the https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/SDF_toolkit/ to add or remove properties). **Example MOPAC input file with three molecules:** ; ````; PM7 OPT XYZ; Methane.

Energy Efficiency,"@patrickfuller . Unfortunately I haven't found an implementation that's different. The only two implementations I know of are the original one you mentioned and this one, and they both have the code I'm questioning. My question was more aimed towards discrepancies with the Orbital Overlap Energy term between those implementations and the derivation in the paper. In both implementations, the orbital overlap energy term is calculated between every atom pair. The derivation specifies that the orbital overlap energy should only be calculated for atom pairs where `i != j`, i.e. not between an atom and itself (or it's own repeated images). I've been thinking more about this, and it looks like the orbital energy term decays _very_ rapidly, so maybe this isn't really a big issue.

In addition, I have a few questions/problems regarding the testing. I added a test case to `ringtest.cpp` where I thought it belonged.

Energy Efficiency,"Ballester and Richards, http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/index/W1J4636Q65R74258.pdf]. This should be quite straightforward to implement within Open Babel - basically, only distances between certain atoms in a molecule have to be measured and the standard statistical moments calculated. I already have a python script based on the Open Babel toolkit to calculate USR and could give support (if needed at all). ABSTRACT:. Molecular databases are routinely screened for compounds that most closely resemble a; molecule of known biological activity to provide novel drug leads. It is widely believed; that three-dimensional molecular shape is the most discriminating pattern for biological; activity as it is directly related to the steep repulsive part of the interaction potential; between the drug-like molecule and its macromolecular target. However, efficient; comparison of molecular shape is currently a challenge. Here, we show that a new; approach based on moments of distance distributions is able to recognize molecular; shape at least three orders of magnitude faster than current methodologies. Such an; ultrafast method permits the identification of similarly shaped compounds within the; largest molecular databases. In addition, the problematic requirement of aligning; molecules for comparison is circumvented, as the proposed distributions are independent; of molecular orientation. Our methodology could be also adapted to tackle similar hard; problems in other fields, such as designing content-based Internet search engines for; three-dimensional geometrical objects or performing fast similarity comparisons between; proteins. From a broader perspective, we anticipate that ultrafast pattern recognition; will soon become not only useful, but also essential to address the data explosion; currently experienced in most scientific disciplines.

Energy Efficiency,"Being able to control the appearance at display time, for instance via CSS, is a nice idea and plays to the strengths of SVG. But it would be tricky to implement immediately because the code for the depiction of molecules is shared with other formats (e.g. PNG) and by the time it gets SVG specific it is just lines and letters (rather than atoms and bonds) being handled. Additional (virtual) functions in the depiction code with different effects for SVG, PNG, etc I think would be necessary. An alternative available now if the OBMol was being handled in C++ or a scripting language, is to color individual atoms and bonds by attaching an OBPairData object:. OBPairData* dp = new OBPairData;; dp->SetAttribute(""color"");; dp->SetValue(""green"");; pAtom->SetData(dp);; ; I think the Python code would be analogous, but Pybel has no simplified form. .

Energy Efficiency,"Constraining the conversion to a small set (`timeout 120 obabel ache_smiles.smi -O ache.sdf --gen3d 5 --p 7.4`) and the fastest algorithm to suggest a conformer (which need not lead to the global optimum), the CLI reports multiple entries where the stereochemistry either is ambiguous, or wrong (`Could not correct 1 stereocenter(s) in this molecule ()`). Actually, there are entries with more than one problematic chirality center, too. In this perspective, it is better if OpenBabel's permanent record only is about the non-problematic structures. The better thing to do would be a revision of the structure generator; since SMILES are a reduced representation of the structures, possibly the maintainers of the generator may fix the problem and benchmark the assignment of stereochemistry (CIP rules) against a reference set. Meanwhile, perhaps the generator you use offers the export of the molecules as 3D structures, e.g. in the .sdf format to bypass the current problem. https://github.com/CIPValidationSuite/ValidationSuite",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2506#issuecomment-1174678164:640,reduce,reduced,640,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2506#issuecomment-1174678164,1,['reduce'],['reduced']

Energy Efficiency,"Dear Dr. Hutchison,. Thank you for you pointing out where the conflict of the this pull request. Actually, this problem is caused by the “priority” of the checking sequence. Let me explain it in detail. To validate the `file-format`, in testing script `scripts/python/examples/testpybel.py`, there is an intentioned `assert`:. ```; LINE 194: def RFformaterror(self):; LINE 195: mol = getattr(self.toolkit.readfile(""noel"", ""head.sdf""), nextmethod)(); ```. In old `pybel.py`, since the format `noel` is not supported at the very beginning, the `format-error` will be raised firstly, by using returned Boolean variable `formatok`, which is just like assumed. . However, in new updated codes, the function becomes: `pybel.readfile(format=None, filename=None, opt=None)`, because the argument `filename` is always required, so to be efficient, it is being checked first. Due to file path of `head.sdf` is `python/examples/head.sdf`, but does not exist at `where-the-ctest-being-executed`, thus the error `IOError` will be raised, yet it is not equivalent with the expected `ValueError`, coded in:. ```; # file: scripts/python/examples/testpybel.py. LINE 197: def testRFformaterror(self):; LINE 198: """"""Test that invalid formats raise an error""""""; LINE 199: self.assertRaises(ValueError, self.RFformaterror); ```.

Energy Efficiency,"First of all thanks for working on and maintaining OpenBabel!. I want to add hydrogens to my pdb file. If I use `obabel 3lcs.pdb -O 3lcs_prot.pdb -h` everything looks great in general but the results don't match my expectations - for example one of the oxygens in the side chain of glutamic acid (e.g. GLU 1197) gets a hydrogen. In physiological conditions (from my understanding) it doesn't have a hydrogen there and is charged. So I moved on to use `-p` instead of `-h` to get hydrogens at pH 7.4. Now from what I can see the hydrogens are added following my expectation, but the pdb file is messed up. (I am using OpenBabel within a Python project, but as the behavior is the same from the command line I used the command line options for easier reproducibility.). Am I missing a preprocessing step or misunderstanding how these options should be used?. Thanks for your time and help!. ## Environment Information; Open Babel version: 3.1.1; Operating system and version: Windows 10. ## Expected Behavior; running `obabel 3lcs.pdb -O 3lcs_prot.pdb -p` should give me my pdb file with hydrogens added but residue numbers and names unchanged. ## Actual Behavior; running `obabel 3lcs.pdb -O 3lcs_prot.pdb -p` changes residue numbers to start at 1 and changes the residue names for everything it doesn't recognize as a standard amino acid or has some other issues with to UNK or UNL.; (From what I see alternative locations and missing atoms seem to cause issues and any ligands in the file also lose their name.). ## Steps to Reproduce; download [the pdb file](https://files.rcsb.org/download/3LCS.pdb) and run the commands (also happens with other pdb files though)",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2677:421,charge,charged,421,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2677,1,['charge'],['charged']

Energy Efficiency,"Good day,. I would like to simulate the small positive charge on halides (Chlorine, Bromine and Iodine, but not Fluorine) on ligands for docking (Autodock) and molecular dynamics simulations (Gromacs, AMBER, using acpype for ligand preparation). When preparing a batch of ligands for these simulations I would like to add an Extra Point (EP) of Charge to halides (similar to how hydrogens are added to structures). The idea is for the EPs to have the following properties and labels (From article: Molecular Mechanical Study of Halogen Bonding in Drug Discovery):; For Chlorine and EP (XCl):; Bond lenght (Cl - XCl = 1.95A ; Angle (X - Cl - XCl) = 180 degrees. For Bromine and EP (XBr):; Bond lenght (Br - XBr = 2.22A ; Angle (X - Br - XBr) = 180 degrees. For iodine and EP (XI):; Bond lenght (CI - XI = 12.35A ; Angle (X - CI - XI) = 180 degrees. I have attached a modified element.txt from Open Babel 2.3.2 (running on Ubuntu 14.04 Linux) that includes the properties XCl, XBr and XI. . I tried to modify the mol.cpp, mol.h, openbabel-python.cpp, openbabel.py and pybel.py files (also attached) to include a new function called AddX (same functionality as AddHydrogens for now, just different name). After sucessfully compiling the modified mol.cpp and mol.h files I then used pycharm and a simple pyhton script to see if it worked. I first tried:; import openbabel, pybel; mol = pybel.readfile(""pdb"", ""~/Documents/test/Chlroroquine.pdb"").next(); print len(mol.atoms), mol.molwt; mol.OBMol.AddHydrogens(); print len(mol.atoms), mol.molwt; pybelmol = pybel.Molecule(mol); pybelmol.write(""pdb"", ""~/Documents/test/Chlroroquine_test.pdb"", overwrite=True). With the following output:; 22 319.87214; 48 319.87214. Then I tried the following::; import openbabel, pybel; mol = pybel.readfile(""pdb"", ""/home/xeonbas/Documents/MGLTools_test/test/Chlrooquine.pdb"").next(); print len(mol.atoms), mol.molwt; mol.OBMol.AddX(); print len(mol.atoms), mol.molwt; pybelmol = pybel.Molecule(mol); pybelmol.write(""pdb"", ",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1542:55,charge,charge,55,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1542,2,"['Charge', 'charge']","['Charge', 'charge']"
Energy Efficiency,"Google drive reports file structures.sdf to be quite large (1.7G). For me, this is much larger, than anticipated and a stop sign (The documentation contains at least one case study including the Tanimoto scores, see https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Fingerprints/fingerprints.html. It would be nice if the manual would state ahead of time how many GBs will be used when running this example, too.). But, does your test set to document the problem need to contain this many molecules/to be this large in volume? Though .sdf may be compressed (e.g., .zip is a permitted file format for an attachment on GitHub), why not describing the test set e.g., in a text file listing the structures as smiles instead? To index the molecules, obabel possibly does not need to know the coordinates of the atoms as long as the atoms' connectivity and stereochemistry (R/S, E/Z configuration) is described; and the reduced representation by a smiles string typically conveys this information.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi @fredrikw,; As you suggested, I've closed the previous issue and am now creating a new one concerning the ""distorted"" PDBQT files. The issue occurs when I visualize the PDBQT files in PyMol. Some structures appear distorted in PyMol (as shown in the attached images). . Consequently, when I use AutoDock Vina to dock the molecule against a specific receptor and then try to visualize the output file in Discovery Studio for ligand-protein interaction, the software cannot recognize the ligand as a single entity. Instead, it identifies two separate fragments, preventing it from generating a 2D interaction diagram. I've attached a few screenshots for reference. The PDBQT files were generated by splitting a single large SDF file into separate fragments, energy minimizing them, and then converting them into PDBQT files using OpenBabel. ; ![Screenshot 2024-08-27 134607](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11c20fd4-d646-4b8d-938a-e68ea6282f49); ![Screenshot 2024-08-27 134733](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02cc1023-27f0-4012-950c-10c77796bdbf)",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2720:759,energy,energy,759,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2720,1,['energy'],['energy']

Energy Efficiency,"Hi there,. I tried to convert a Tyrosine from PDB to MOL by adding hydrogens at pH 7. I observed that one hydrogen is always added to the tyrosine hydroxyl at a given position (let's call it 'A') when there is only this residue in the PDB file. However, when the PDB file contains other residues and a ligand near the tyrosine, the hydrogen is always placed at another position (let's call it 'B'). At this position, the hydrogen points out to the ligand oxygen, which would favor a hydrogen bond. The same would not happen with the hydrogen placed at position A. However, when I tried to convert the entire PDB file, the hydrogen position at the hydroxyl changed to position A again. So, I wonder what may be happening with the hydrogen addition under the hoods. I thought the hydrogen placement would be biased by potential hydrogen bonds when I converted that given tyrosine with nearby residues and ligands. But I got a different result when I used the entire PDB file. Note that the nearby residues/ligands are a subset of the entire PDB, so I think the conversion shouldn't have changed. . So, I wonder if Open Babel considers local pH or nearby charges and hydrogens to properly define the hydrogens. I tried to find some posts or issues at this repo to learn more about how hydrogens are placed by Open Babel, but I couldn't find any clues explaining why this unexpected situation happened. Would you have any ideas?

Quick look in the gaussformat.cpp shows that only Mulliken charges are interpreted.

Profiling revealed that a considerable amount of time is spent in OBAromaticTyper::SelectRootAtoms(...) (typer.cpp),; due to the fact that the root atoms are always checked against all rings (which are numerous in large proteins); - even though not actually being part of it. . Attached is a proposal for a slightly modified new version of the function with some loop ; re-organization and including a look-up list for which atom is part of which ring. This ensures that ; rootAtoms are only analyzed in the relevant rings. This reduced the amount to time spent in the ; SelectRootAtoms()-function to a fraction of the original time used. . cheers; F.

Energy Efficiency,"I am considering to include OpenBabel force fields in on of my applications, studying conformational transitions of (macro)molecules.; To this end, I need the values of the molecular energy, gradients and (possibly) the second derivatives. I managed to write a wrapper that gives me the energy of a configuration, but I could not find a way to access the values of the gradients (using the API's of openbabel-2.2.3).; As far as I understand, this is so because the routines that calculate the gradients are declared ""private"" in include/openbabel/forcefield.h, but I cannot see why this has to be so. Therefore, I am suggesting to extend/modify the API to allow access of the force-field gradients to general programs making use of the library. As a first step to this goal, I managed to patch the source code of openbabel, moving the declaration of GetGradients and friends in the public section of the relevant classes (see the attached file).; After recompiling the library, I am now able to access the forces, after calling the method Energy of OBForceField with the value ""true"".; This is probably not the most elegant hack around, but it ""works for me"" and might be useful to other people.

Energy Efficiency,"I don't think that the lack of explicit connectivity is a huge issue here, it can be guessed quite accurately from the interatomic distances. As long as there aren't any clashes (non-bonded atoms at a distance near the sum of their covalent radii), the bonds are trivial to identify. After all, it's not like Gaussview or Avogadro have some special information about the bonding of the molecule; it outputs the bonds that the user created, which do not have to be chemically reasonable (e.g., bonded atoms very far away or non-bonded atoms very close). At that point, it is debatable whether the correct connectivity if the one chosen by the user or the one that would be computed using DFT/WFT. Another option is to use a cheap method like GFN2-xTB to calculate the effective bonds and charges in the molecule, giving quite sensible connectivities in `MOL` format. But then, again, it does not seem to set `M CHG` or `M RAD` either, so we're back to the same issue. Are the charges/radicals really necessary to generate the InChI?

Energy Efficiency,"I have the same problem with version 2.4.1 on Gentoo, reading output from GAMESS-US ver. 11 Nov 2017 (R3). I did some debugging and I found the problem to be in actual part of **gamessformat.cpp** that reads frequencies. Namely in line **515**, before reading reduced mass, it should also read SYMMETRY line:; ```; frequencies.push_back(atof(vs[i].c_str()));; }; ifs.getline(buffer, BUFF_SIZE); // reduced mass; ```; Fixed:; ```; frequencies.push_back(atof(vs[i].c_str()));; }; ifs.getline(buffer, BUFF_SIZE); // SYMMETRY; ifs.getline(buffer, BUFF_SIZE); // reduced mass; ```; otherwise lines **549-550** process a blank line instead of an atom - hence the segfault. Patch is attached that fixes the code. Here is a fragment of the GAMESS output where the problem appears:; > FREQUENCY: 2.93 1.88 0.55 0.35 0.16; > SYMMETRY: E E E E E; > REDUCED MASS: 6.79503 6.40438 13.42881 10.66293 9.71937; > IR INTENSITY: 0.23456 0.34034 0.01209 0.00004 0.00182. The second issue arises at the end of the loop that reads the modes (lines **582-584**):; ```; ifs.getline(buffer, BUFF_SIZE);; tokenize(vs, buffer);; modeCount = vs.size() - 3;; ```; At the end of the modes `buffer` variable contains empty string, so `vs.size()` returns 0. However, `modeCount` is defined as `unsigned int` (in line **544**):; ```; unsigned int modeCount = vs.size() - 3;; ```; therefore line **584** produces a huge positive value instead of -3, and the program does not leave the loop (condition in line **547**), leading to another segfault, which wasn't exposed due to the first one.

Energy Efficiency,"I'd like to see more output options with Obgen. It's a really handy tool for me but I feel I am limited by the formatting of the output... ; - Whenever I use obgen to convert SMILES strings --> .sdf files; I notice that the the automatically generated ID for the smiles string is not completely unique. I run a script directing obgen to process 100 files at a time in 200 parallel sessions - as a result if all sessions start at the same time I see block repeats of the same ID e.g. 'OpenBabel08061310513D' ; I would love to see a simple implementation of a unique ID generator - or perhaps even a way to read in names. . Energy minimization steps and other forcefield parameters would also be nice to specify asides from default settings. The sdf output file is not correctly formatted, the molecule data sections contain a space at the start of the file, which makes it uninterpretable for consistent conversion to other file formats.

Energy Efficiency,"I've been reading up on charge equilibration methods, specifically the EQeq method by Wilmer et al.

I've noticed some inconsistencies with the implementation in both codes with the derivation provided in the supporting info. I'll focus on the Ewald implementation, as that's the one that I've been spending time on:. # Solving the Problem; The basis of the EQeq method is forming a system of equations and solving it with Householder or something equivalent. This system of equations aims to minimize all charges in the system, subject to the constraint that the system is charge neutral. I won't go into details of the method here, but it uses Lagrange multipliers and eventually solves a problem similar to `Ax = b` where `x` contains the charges in the system. . The main difficulty of this method is constructing `A`, but each entry contains a few terms, including Coulombic terms, idempotential and orbital overlap energy. # Orbital Overlap Energy; In the derivation Wilmer et al. talk about the orbital overlap energy term (or short-ranged damping term), which they define as. <a href=""https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=E_o(r_{ij})&space;=&space;\sum_m&space;\left(\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{J_{ij}r_{ij}}{K}&space;\right&space;)^2}&space;\left(\frac{J_{ij}}{K}&space;=&space;\frac{J_{ij}^2r_{ij}}{K^2}&space;-&space;\frac{1}{r_{ij}}&space;\right&space;)&space;\right&space;)"" target=""_blank""><img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E_o(r_{ij})&space;=&space;\sum_m&space;\left(\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{J_{ij}r_{ij}}{K}&space;\right&space;)^2}&space;\left(\frac{J_{ij}}{K}&space;=&space;\frac{J_{ij}^2r_{ij}}{K^2}&space;-&space;\frac{1}{r_{ij}}&space;\right&space;)&space;\right&space;)"" title=""E_o(r_{ij}) = \sum_m \left(\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\frac{J_{ij}r_{ij}}{K} \right )^2",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1861:24,charge,charge,24,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1861,4,['charge'],"['charge', 'charges']"

The additional tests add a few minutes to testing, but I think it's very important that we include them. This sort of large test set is needed.

Energy Efficiency,It is also worth noting that the `--gen3d slow` option produces something that is typically lower energy that the default option. . If someone can show me how to extract the energy in python or the command line then I can gather some statistics for around 130 molecules. Every attempt I've done to get the energy from python produces 0.0. Every attempt I've done to get the energy from the command line has produced the same value even when the structure changes. I must be doing something wrong when trying to get the energy using obabel.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2347#issuecomment-809920877:98,energy,energy,98,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/2347#issuecomment-809920877,5,['energy'],['energy']
Energy Efficiency,It's not apparent from the Jmol documentation how the pngj format is constructed. But looking at the supplied file suggests that it is too dissimilar to the OpenBabel png format to be easily adapted.

Energy Efficiency,"Just about `--gen3d`: this is a handy abbreviation to perform *an* optimization as if there were nothing (no solvent, no bulk, no ligand; but uniform vacuum) around the molecule of interest. But it is one of five options to guess an energetic optimum.

Energy Efficiency,"KirkSimmons, email: KirkASimmons@gmail.com. OpenBabel 2.2.0 on a Windows XP Pro, Service Pack 3, Intel system. . Checking the option to output disconnected fragments as separate files causes OpenBabel to crash. I used the following sdfile as an example. System crashes is smi input to smi output, or smi input to sdfile output. I checked earlier versions (2.1.0 and 2.1.1) they did not crash but the output suggested things were not correct there either as <partial charges> flags are repeated in the output sdfile.

Energy Efficiency,"Large numbers of optimization steps with OBForceField lead to NaN for coordinates. For example, by 138 CG steps (out of 250) on the attached file, the steps essentially reach convergence, and then everything goes to NaN (coordinates and energies). The optimization routines should have cutoffs for accuracy in gradient or energy (e.g., below e-8 in either, no step is taken and the routine exits early). Ideally these accuracy criteria could be user parameters to allow ""rough optimization"" as well.

However, the string returned by GetType() is set to an arbitrary value by an atom typer (or indeed the user), and so the results will change. Line 208 should be rewritten to avoid using GetType(). For example, it could call a function that checks whether the atom is nitrogen, and checks the type explicitly using Open Babel function calls.",MatchSource.ISSUE,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1760:111,charge,charge,111,http://openbabel.org/,https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/issues/1760,1,['charge'],['charge']
