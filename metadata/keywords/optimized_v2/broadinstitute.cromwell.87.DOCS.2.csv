Performance,"** Summarizer configuration **. The frequency of metadata summarization is determined by the value for the configuration key; `services.MetadataService.config.metadata-summary-refresh-interval`, which has a default value of `1 second`.; As stated above, there must be exactly one Cromwell instance performing the role of summarizer, so; all Cromwell instances which are not performing the summarizer role should specify `Inf` for this value. ** Runner configuration **. Cromwell instances in the runner role should periodically scan the workflow store to pick up and run; unclaimed workflows. The relevant configuration parameters are described below along with their default values.; The default values may be adequate for instances in the runner role, but will need to be overridden for; non-runner instances to effectively turn running off. ```hocon; system {; ...; # Number of seconds between polls of the workflow store.; # Set this to a very large value for non-runners (e.g. 999999); new-workflow-poll-rate = 20. # Cromwell will launch up to N submitted workflows at a time, regardless of how many open workflow slots exist; # Set this to 0 for a non-runner.; max-workflow-launch-count = 1. # The maximum number of workflows to run concurrently.; # Set this to 0 for a non-runner.; max-concurrent-workflows = 5000; ...; }; ```. The documentation on [workflow heartbeats](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Configuring/#workflow-heartbeats) describes how multiple Cromwell; runners collaborate to run workflows from a single workflow store. ** Front end configuration **. Cromwell instances should not require any configuration changes to operate in the front end role. If a particular; Cromwell instance is not intended to operate in the front end role then requests should not be directed to; that instance. If there are multiple front end instances then it may be desirable to configure a load balancer; in front of these instances to direct requests to the front end instances only.

Performance,"**. Cromwell will automatically shutdown when unable to write heartbeats for a period of time. This period of time may be; adjusted via:. ```hocon; system.workflow-heartbeats {; write-failure-shutdown-duration = 5 minutes; }; ```. The default shutdown duration is 5 minutes. The maximum allowed shutdown duration is the TTL. **Heartbeat Batch Size**. Workflow heartbeats are internally queued by Cromwell and written in batches. When the configurable batch size is; reached, all of the heartbeats within the batch will be written at the same time, even if the heartbeat interval has not; elapsed. This batch threshold may be adjusted via:. ```hocon; system.workflow-heartbeats {; write-batch-size = 100; }; ```. The default batch size is 100. **Heartbeat Threshold**. Cromwell writes one batch of workflow heartbeats at a time. While the internal queue of heartbeats-to-write passes above; a configurable threshold then [instrumentation](developers/Instrumentation.md) may send a metric signal that the; heartbeat load is above normal. This threshold may be configured via the configuration value:. ```hocon; system.workflow-heartbeats {; write-threshold = 100; }; ```. The default threshold value is 100, just like the default for the heartbeat batch size. ### YAML. **Maximum number of nodes**. Cromwell will throw an error when detecting cyclic loops in Yaml inputs. However one can craft small acyclic YAML; documents that consume significant amounts of memory or cpu. To limit the amount of processing during parsing, there is; a limit on the number of nodes parsed per YAML document. This limit may be configured via the configuration value:. ```hocon; yaml {; max-nodes = 1000000; }; ```. The default limit is 1,000,000 nodes. **Maximum nesting depth**. There is a limit on the maximum depth of nested YAML. If you decide to increase this value, you will likely need to also; increase the Java Virtual Machine's thread stack size as well using; [either `-Xss` or `-XX:ThreadStackSize`](https:/",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md:26228,load,load,26228,docs/Configuring.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md,1,['load'],['load']

Performance,"**Google Cloud Batch Backend (alpha)**. [//]:; Google Cloud Batch is a fully managed service that lets you schedule, queue, and execute batch processing workloads on Google Cloud resources. Batch provisions resources and manages capacity on your behalf, allowing your batch workloads to run at scale. This section offers detailed configuration instructions for using Cromwell with the Google Cloud Batch in all supported; authentication modes. Before reading further in this section please see the; [Getting started on Google Cloud Batch](../tutorials/Batch101) for instructions common to all authentication modes; and detailed instructions for the application default authentication scheme in particular.; The instructions below assume you have created a Google Cloud Storage bucket and a Google project enabled for the appropriate APIs. *NOTE*: Google Cloud Batch is still in alpha version, this means that there could be breaking changes, be sure to review the [GCP Batch CHANGELOG](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#gcp-batch) carefully before upgrading. **Configuring Authentication**. The `google` stanza in the Cromwell configuration file defines how to authenticate to Google. There are four different; authentication schemes that might be used:. * `application_default` (default, recommended) - Use [application default](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials) credentials.; * `service_account` - Use a specific service account and key file (in PEM format) to authenticate.; * `user_account` - Authenticate as a user.; * `user_service_account` - Authenticate each individual workflow using service account credentials supplied in the workflow options. The `auths` block in the `google` stanza defines the authentication schemes within a Cromwell deployment:. ```hocon; google {; application-name = ""cromwell""; auths = [; {; name = ""application-default""; scheme = ""application_default""; },; {; name = ""service-accoun",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/GCPBatch.md:117,queue,queue,117,docs/backends/GCPBatch.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/GCPBatch.md,1,['queue'],['queue']

Performance,"-terse`, the job id will be the entire contents of the stdout, but should be all digits:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; job-id-regex = ""(\\d+)""; }; ```. #### How Cromwell should abort an HPC job. When aborting an HPC job, Cromwell will run a command confifured under the key `kill`, passing in the WDL variable `job_id`:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; kill = ""qdel ${job_id}""; }; ```. #### How Cromwell checks if an HPC job is alive. Whenever Cromwell restarts it checks to see if a job has completed by searching for return code in a file called `rc`. If this file isn't available, in this case Cromwell runs an extra check to make sure the job is still alive. You can configure the command used for this check via:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; check-alive = ""qstat -j ${job_id}""; }; ```. #### Other backend settings. On some systems, the administrators may limit the number of HPC jobs a user may run at a time. To configure this limit, you can use the value `concurrent-job-limit` to limit the number of jobs. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; concurrent-job-limit = 100; }; ```. #### Putting the config section all together. With the above sections, we can combine them all together to create a completly working HPC backend. ```hocon; backend {; default = SGE; ; providers {; SGE {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; concurrent-job-limit = 100; ; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int cpu = 1; Float? memory_gb; String? sge_queue; String? sge_project; """"""; ; submit = """"""; qsub \; -terse \; -V \; -b y \; -N ${job_name} \; -wd ${cwd} \; -o ${out} \; -e ${err} \; -pe smp ${cpu} \; ${""-l mem_free="" + memory_gb + ""g""} \; ${""-q "" + sge_queue} \; ${""-P "" + sge_project} \; /usr/bin/env bash ${script}; """""". job-id-regex = ""(\\d+)"". kill = ""qdel ${job_id}""; check-alive = ""qstat -j ${job_id}""; }; }; }; }; ```.

Performance,"/Backends.md#backend-job-limits). ; - Within that limit, a hog factor allows us to limit the maximum concurrent jobs started *per hog group*.; + This is what allows new jobs to run immediately even if many jobs from bigger workflows are already queued up. #### Round robin allocation. Rather than starting jobs on a strict first-come first served basis, Cromwell now assigns in a round-robin; fashion between hog groups and then on a first-come-first-served *within* a hog group. In other words if the hog groups had the following entries queued up:; ```; A: jobA1, jobA2, jobA3, ..., jobA1000000; B: jobB1, jobB2; C: jobC1; D: jobD1, jobD2; ```. Then Cromwell would start the jobs in the following order, even though `jobA1000000` was added before `jobD1`:; ```; jobA1, jobB1, jobC1, jobD1, jobA2, jobB2, jobD2, jobA3, ..., jobA1000000; ```. #### Example: How job execution is affected by hog factors. ##### An administrator sets up a Cromwell server. - A Cromwell administrator sets the overall maximum concurrent job limit to 100,000 PAPIv2 jobs.; - The administrator also sets the hog factor to be 25.; - Cromwell will therefore calculate a per-hog-group concurrent job limit of 4,000 PAPIv2 jobs. ##### Our first hog group hits its limit. - 100 workflows are running in hog group ""A"" and between them have generated 20,000 jobs for PAPIv2. ; + Cromwell initially starts 4,000 jobs.; + Cromwell then starts the remaining 16,000 new jobs as existing jobs from this group finish.; + New workflows in this group will not be able to start jobs either; + Their jobs are queued behind the existing jobs from this hog group.; + Note that Cromwell is currently only using 1/25th of its overall limit because its hog factor is 25. ##### Another hog group appears. - Now hog group B submits 1,000 workflows and between them they generate 200,000 jobs for PAPIv2.; - Even though 16,000 of group A's jobs are still queued, Cromwell starts 4,000 of group B's jobs immediately,; - The remaining 196,000 of group",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md:5736,concurren,concurrent,5736,docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md,1,['concurren'],['concurrent']
Performance,"/mnt/two` will also be available within containers at their; original paths outside the container. So soft links pointing to paths under those directories will resolve during the; job execution. Note that if a user runs a workflow using an input file `/mnt/three/path/to/file` the job will fail; during execution as `/mnt/three` was not present inside the running container. ### Additional FileSystems. HPC backends (as well as the Local backend) can be configured to be able to interact with other type of filesystems, where the input files can be located for example.; Currently the only other filesystem supported is Google Cloud Storage (GCS). See the [Google section](Google) of the documentation for information on how to configure GCS in Cromwell.; Once you have a google authentication configured, you can simply add a `gcs` stanza in your configuration file to enable GCS:. ```; backend.providers.MyHPCBackend {; filesystems {; gcs {; # A reference to a potentially different auth for manipulating files via engine functions.; auth = ""application-default""; }; }; }; ```. ### Exit code timeout. If the cluster forcefully kills a job, it is unable to write its exit code anymore.; To address this the option `exit-code-timeout-seconds` can be used.; Cromwell will check the aliveness of the job with the `check-alive` script, every `exit-code-timeout-seconds` (polling).; When a job is no longer alive and another `exit-code-timeout-seconds` seconds have passed without an RC file being made, Cromwell can mark the job as failed.; If retries are enabled the job is submitted again.; This option will enable polling with the `check-alive` option, this could cause high load on whatever system `check-alive` calls. When the option `exit-code-timeout-seconds` is **not** set cromwell will only execute the `check-alive` option after a restart of a cromwell server. ```; backend {; providers {; <backend name> {; config {; exit-code-timeout-seconds = 120; # other config options; }; }; }; }; ```; ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/HPC.md:6318,load,load,6318,docs/backends/HPC.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/HPC.md,1,['load'],['load']

To optimize job execution time, Cromwell 55 and later support the use of Docker image caches on the PAPI v2 lifesciences beta backend. Docker image caches are not available on the PAPI v2 genomics alpha backend.; Configuration looks like:. ```hocon; backend {; ...; providers {; ...; PapiV2 {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.google.pipelines.v2beta.PipelinesApiLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; ...; docker-image-cache-manifest-file = ""gs://path/to/a/docker/image/cache/manifest.json""; ...; }; }; }; }; ```. Docker image cache manifest JSONs have a format like:. ```json; {; ""biocontainers/samtools:1.3.1"": ""projects/broad-dsde-cromwell-dev/global/images/v1-docker-biocontainers-samtools-1-3-1"",; ""gcr.io/gcp-runtimes/ubuntu_16_0_4:latest"": ""projects/broad-dsde-cromwell-dev/global/images/v1-docker-gcr-io-gcp-runtimes-ubuntu-16-0-4-latest"",; ...; }; ```. Docker image cache usage is an opt-in feature, so workflow submissions must specify this workflow option:. ```json; {; ...; ""use_docker_image_cache"": true,; ...; }; ```. Individual tasks within a workflow can turn off Docker image caching through the use of a runtime attribute:. ```wdl; task my_task {; ...; runtime {; ...; useDockerImageCache: false; }; }; ```. If Cromwell is running a workflow on PAPI v2 beta with Docker image caching enabled and a task specifies a; Docker image which corresponds to a configured Docker image cache JSON, Cromwell will arrange for the; job's VM to mount a disk built from the corresponding disk image. In the event that multiple; manifests describe disk images containing the specified Docker image, Cromwell will choose the disk image with the; smallest `diskSizeGb` value. Conversely, Docker image caching can be turned off at the workflow level (either turned off explicitly or left at the; default setting of `false`) but turned on at the individual task level:. ```wdl; task my_task {; ...; runtime {; ...; us",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/Google.md:28021,cache,cache,28021,docs/backends/Google.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/Google.md,1,['cache'],['cache']

Some configuration changes were introduced in Cromwell 67 to support improved scaling. See Cromwell's `reference.conf` for details on new parameters. * I/O throttling moved from `io` to its own `io.throttle` stanza; config updates may be required if these values are currently being overridden in local deployments. * The default `system.job-rate-control` has been changed from 50 per second to 20 per 10 seconds. * New configuration parameters have been introduced for values which were previously hardcoded constants:; * `system.file-hash-batch-size`, value updated from `100` to `50`.; * `io.gcs.max-batch-size`, value stays the same at `100`.; * `io.gcs.max-batch-duration`, value stays the same at `5 seconds`. * New configuration parameters which should not require updating:; * `io.command-backpressure-staleness`; * `io.backpressure-extension-log-threshold`; * `load-control.io-normal-window-minimum`; * `load-control.io-normal-window-maximum`. * `io.nio.parallelism` was previously misspelled in `reference.conf` but not in Cromwell's configuration reading code. Only correct spellings of this configuration key had or will have effect. ## 66 Release Notes. ### Google Artifact Registry Support; Cromwell now supports call caching when using Docker",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:22603,throttle,throttle,22603,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['throttle'],['throttle']

Performance,"; Cromwell can be thought of as performing three fundamental roles:. 1. Front end - handling all REST requests; 1. Runner - picking up and running workflows; 1. Summarizer - summarizing metadata. In the simplest Cromwell deployment, a single Cromwell instance performs all three of these roles.; But it is also possible to create Cromwell deployments with many Cromwell instances, gaining advantages in; resiliency and scalability. There is only one restriction on roles: there must be exactly one Cromwell; instance performing the role of summarizer. Apart from this restriction, any instance in a multi-Cromwell; deployment can perform one or more of these roles. As a real world example, the current production Terra; deployment uses 7 Cromwell instances, each dedicated to a single role: 3 front ends, 3 runners, and one summarizer. These roles are not explicit in Cromwell configuration, rather they are implied by configuration settings as; described below. ** Summarizer configuration **. The frequency of metadata summarization is determined by the value for the configuration key; `services.MetadataService.config.metadata-summary-refresh-interval`, which has a default value of `1 second`.; As stated above, there must be exactly one Cromwell instance performing the role of summarizer, so; all Cromwell instances which are not performing the summarizer role should specify `Inf` for this value. ** Runner configuration **. Cromwell instances in the runner role should periodically scan the workflow store to pick up and run; unclaimed workflows. The relevant configuration parameters are described below along with their default values.; The default values may be adequate for instances in the runner role, but will need to be overridden for; non-runner instances to effectively turn running off. ```hocon; system {; ...; # Number of seconds between polls of the workflow store.; # Set this to a very large value for non-runners (e.g. 999999); new-workflow-poll-rate = 20. # Cromwell will l",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Scaling.md:32,perform,performing,32,docs/Scaling.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Scaling.md,5,"['perform', 'scalab']","['perform', 'performing', 'performs', 'scalability']"
Performance,"; prefixes that call cache hit output files should have in order to be considered as a cache hit. Using PAPI as an example and assuming Alice and Bob have; made their data accessible to each other, Alice could submit a workflow with these options:. ```; {; ""call_cache_hit_path_prefixes"": [ ""gs://alice_bucket"", ""gs://bob_bucket"" ]; }; ```. With these workflow options Cromwell would only look for cache hits for Alice's jobs in Alice's or Bob's buckets. As a further optimization the PAPI backend has the concept of ""this"" bucket on a per-workflow basis, where ""this"" bucket is; the bucket that contains the current workflow root.; If `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` is specified in ; workflow options on the PAPI backend, Cromwell will automatically prepend ""this"" bucket to the call cache hit path prefixes to search.; For example, if Charles specified the same workflow options as in the example above and his workflow root was under `gs://charles_bucket`,; Cromwell would search cache hits in all of the `gs://alice_bucket`, `gs://bob_bucket` and `gs://charles_bucket` buckets without having to specify; `gs://charles_bucket` bucket explicitly in `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes`. If no `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` are specified then all matching cache hits will be considered. ***Call cache failure logging***. When Cromwell fails to cache a job from a previous result the reason will be logged. To reduce the verbosity of the logs; only the first three failure reasons will be logged per shard of each job. Cromwell will continue to try copying; previous results for the call, and when no candidates are left Cromwell will run the job on the backend. **Docker Tags**. Certain Docker tags can impact call caching performance. ; Docker tags are a convenient way to point to a version of an image (`ubuntu:14.04`), or even the latest version (`ubuntu:latest`).; For that purpose, tags are mutable, meaning that the image they point to can change, while the tag name stays the same.; While this is ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md:7520,cache,cache,7520,docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,1,['cache'],['cache']
Performance,"AWS Batch Backend Architecture; ==============================. Overview; --------. The architecture of the code base follows very closely to the Google version.; Probably a little too closely, and lots of code was lifted from the Google; backend originally, then modified to work with AWS. Fundamentally, Google Pipelines API (a.k.a. PAPI) works pretty differently from; AWS Batch. In Pipelines, all the infrastructure is completely managed by Google,; while AWS Batch exposes that infrastructure to a large degree so that customers; can fine tune it as necessary. An implementation that uses Fargate might be an ; alternative that is closer or an implementation that uses Step Functions although; that would be a separate backend. From a Cromwell perspective, this means that unlike Pipelines, where; infrastructure details are defined in the configuration or the WDL, in AWS; Batch, these configuration details are handled outside. All the AWS Batch; backend needs to know is ""what is the ARN for the job Queue""?. A good example of the difference can be seen in the 'disks' configuration. In; Pipelines, you need to specify the type of disk and size. In AWS, this will; be defined instead when you setup your environment (more on that later), so; all the AWS backend really needs to know is what mount points you need; defined. This infrastructure and all the associated configuration still exists; however,; it is moved out of the Cromwell configuration. AWS Batch; ---------. Because AWS Batch is so different from PAPI, those familiar only with PAPI; would be best off with an overview of AWS Batch. If you are familiar with; the workings of Batch, feel free to skip this section, and move on. [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) fundamentally is a service to allow batch jobs to run easily and; efficiently. To use it effectively, however, you need to understand its own; technical stack. To create a job, you need a ""Job Queue"".

Performance,"Call Caching allows Cromwell to detect when a job has been run in the past so that it doesn't have to re-compute results, saving both time and money. Cromwell searches the cache of previously run jobs for one that has the exact same command and exact same inputs. If a previously run job is found in the cache, Cromwell will use the results of the previous job instead of re-running it. Cromwell's call cache is maintained in its database. In order for call caching to be used on any previously run jobs,; it is best to configure Cromwell to [point to a MySQL database](../Configuring.md#database) instead of the default; in-memory database. This way any invocation of Cromwell (either with `run` or `server` subcommands) will be able to; utilize results from all calls that are in that database. **Configuring Call Caching**. *Call Caching is disabled by default.* Call Caching can be enabled in your Cromwell; [Configuration](../Configuring.md#call-caching) and the behavior can be modified via; [Workflow Options](../wf_options/Overview.md).

Once enabled, Cromwell by default will search the call cache for every `call` statement invocation. * If there was no cache hit, the `call` will be executed as normal. Once finished it will add itself to the cache.; * If there was a cache hit, outputs are either **copied from the original cached job to the new job's output directory**; or **referenced from the original cached job** depending on the Cromwell; [Configuration](../Configuring.md#call-caching) settings. > **Note:** If call caching is enabled, be careful not to change the contents of the output directory for any previously run job.

Performance,"For backends that support aborting jobs, Cromwell can be configured to automatically try to abort all calls when it receives a Control-C, also known as SIGINT. All currently running calls will also set their status to `Aborted`. To explicitly turn this feature on or off, set the configuration option:. ```hocon; system {; abort-jobs-on-terminate=true; }; ```. Or, via `-Dsystem.abort-jobs-on-terminate=true` command line option. By default, this value is false when running `java -jar cromwell.jar server`, and true when running `java -jar cromwell.jar run <workflow source> <inputs>`. Read the [Abort](execution/ExecutionTwists/#abort) section to learn more about how abort works. ### Call caching. Call Caching allows Cromwell to detect when a job has been run in the past so it doesn't have to re-compute results. ; To learn more see [Call Caching](cromwell_features/CallCaching). To enable Call Caching, add the following to your Cromwell configuration:. ```; call-caching {; enabled = true; invalidate-bad-cache-results = true; }; ```. When `call-caching.enabled=true` (default: `false`), Cromwell will be able to to reference or copy results from previously run jobs (when appropriate).; When `invalidate-bad-cache-results=true` (default: `true`), Cromwell will invalidate any cache results which contain files that cannot be accessed within a cache-hit. This is usually desired, but might be unwanted if this failure occurs for external reasons, such as a difference in user authentication. Cromwell also accepts [Workflow Options](wf_options/Overview#call-caching-options) to override the cache read/write behavior. . ### Local filesystem options. When running a job on the Config (Shared Filesystem) backend, Cromwell provides some additional options in the backend's ; config section:. ```HOCON; config {; filesystems {; local {; # When localizing a file, what type of file duplication should occur. ; # possible values: ""hard-link"", ""soft-link"", ""copy"", ""cached-copy"".; # For more informa",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md:17148,cache,cache-results,17148,docs/Configuring.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md,1,['cache'],['cache-results']

Performance,"Sciences jobs failed due to insufficient quota, instead of queueing and waiting until; quota is available (which is the expected behavior). Cromwell will now retry under these conditions, which present with errors; such as ""PAPI error code 9"", ""no available zones"", and/or ""quota too low"". ### Database. #### New table 'GROUP_METRICS_ENTRY'. A new table called `GROUP_METRICS_ENTRY` has been added. The purpose of this table is to track when a group or billing project last ran into Cloud Quota exhaustion. #### Index removal. The `IX_WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY_WS` index is removed from `WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY`. The index had low cardinality and workflow pickup is faster without it. Migration time depends on workflow store size, but should be very fast for most installations. Terminal workflows are removed from the workflow store, so only running workflows contribute to the cost. ### Bug fixes. #### Improved `size()` function performance on arrays. Resolved a hotspot in Cromwell to make the `size()` engine function perform much faster on file arrays. Common examples of file arrays could include globs or scatter-gather results. This enhancement applies only to WDL 1.0 and later, because that's when `size()` added [support for arrays](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/main/versions/1.0/SPEC.md#acceptable-compound-input-types). #### Fixed Optional and String Concatenation Bug. As outlined in the [WDL Spec](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/main/versions/1.0/SPEC.md#prepending-a-string-to-an-optional-parameter), concatenating a string with an empty optional now correctly evaluates to the empty string. ### Removals. #### `RESTAPI.md` docs discontinued.

Performance,"`cromwell_root` and it is set to `./cromwell-executions` by default. Relative paths are interpreted as relative to the current working directory of the Cromwell process. When Cromwell runs a workflow, it first creates a directory `<cromwell_root>/<workflow_uuid>`. This is called the `workflow_root` and it is the root directory for all activity in this workflow. Each `call` has its own subdirectory located at `<workflow_root>/call-<call_name>`. This is the `<call_dir>`.; Any input files to a call need to be localized into the `<call_dir>/inputs` directory. There are different localization strategies that Cromwell will try until one works:. * `hard-link` - This will create a hard link to the file; * `soft-link` - Create a symbolic link to the file. This strategy is not enabled by default for tasks which specify a ; Docker image and will be ignored.; * `copy` - Make a copy the file; * `cached-copy` An experimental feature. This copies files to a file cache in ; `<workflow_root>/cached-inputs` and then hard links them in the `<call_dir>/inputs` directory. . `cached-copy` is intended for a shared filesystem that runs on multiple physical disks, where docker containers are used. ; Hard-links don't work between different physical disks and soft-links don't work with docker by default. Copying uses a lot of; space if a multitude of tasks use the same input. `cached-copy` copies the file only once to the physical disk containing; the `<workflow_root>` and then uses hard links for every task that needs the input file. This can save a lot of space. The default order in `reference.conf` is `hard-link`, `soft-link`, `copy`. Shared filesystem localization is defined in the `config` section of each backend. The default stanza for the Local and HPC backends looks like this:. ```; filesystems {; local {; localization: [; 	 ""hard-link"", ""soft-link"", ""copy""; ]; }; }; ```. ### Optional docker soft links.

Performance,"ache_hit_path_prefixes` workflow option for this purpose. This is particularly useful in the PAPI backend where the workflow; root can be specified in workflow options via `jes_gcs_root`. The value of `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` should be an array of strings representing ; prefixes that call cache hit output files should have in order to be considered as a cache hit. Using PAPI as an example and assuming Alice and Bob have; made their data accessible to each other, Alice could submit a workflow with these options:. ```; {; ""call_cache_hit_path_prefixes"": [ ""gs://alice_bucket"", ""gs://bob_bucket"" ]; }; ```. With these workflow options Cromwell would only look for cache hits for Alice's jobs in Alice's or Bob's buckets. As a further optimization the PAPI backend has the concept of ""this"" bucket on a per-workflow basis, where ""this"" bucket is; the bucket that contains the current workflow root.; If `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` is specified in ; workflow options on the PAPI backend, Cromwell will automatically prepend ""this"" bucket to the call cache hit path prefixes to search.; For example, if Charles specified the same workflow options as in the example above and his workflow root was under `gs://charles_bucket`,; Cromwell would search cache hits in all of the `gs://alice_bucket`, `gs://bob_bucket` and `gs://charles_bucket` buckets without having to specify; `gs://charles_bucket` bucket explicitly in `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes`. If no `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` are specified then all matching cache hits will be considered. ***Call cache failure logging***. When Cromwell fails to cache a job from a previous result the reason will be logged. To reduce the verbosity of the logs; only the first three failure reasons will be logged per shard of each job. Cromwell will continue to try copying; previous results for the call, and when no candidates are left Cromwell will run the job on the backend. **Docker Tags**.

The rules for call caching in HPC backends are:; * `docker`: Will be considered when call caching.; * Memory options: Will *not* be considered when call caching.; * CPU options: Will *not* be considered when call caching.; * Custom Attributes: Will *not* be considered when call caching (by default).; ; Although custom attributes will not be considered when call caching by default, you can override this in a `runtime-attributes-for-caching` section. Eg:; ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; String sge_queue = ""short""; String singularity_image; # ...; """"""; runtime-attributes-for-caching {; sge_queue: false; singularity_image: true; }; }; ```. * Note: Only *custom* attributes can be altered like this. Memory, CPU and docker will always have their default cache-consideration behavior.; * Note: Unlike memory, cpu and docker attributes which inherit validation and hash-lookup behavior, any custom attributes will be simple primitive comparisons.; * For example, a `docker` attribute will be cached by looking up docker hashes against a docker repository, but a custom `singularity` attribute would be a primitive string match. #### How Cromwell should start an HPC job. When Cromwell runs a task, it will fill in a template for the job using the declared runtime attributes. This specific template will vary depending on the requirements of your HPC cluster. For example, say you normally submit jobs to SGE using:. ```bash; qsub -terse -V -b y -N my_job_name \; -wd /path/to/working_directory \; -o /path/to/stdout.qsub \; -e /path/to/stderr.qsub \; -pe smp 1 -l mem_free=0.5g -q short \; /usr/bin/env bash myScript.bash; ```.

For more options, see the [Configuring authentication of Cromwell with AWS](/backends/AWSBatch#configuring-authentication) section below. #### Configuring the AWS environment. Next you'll need the following setup in your AWS account:; - The core set of resources (S3 Bucket, IAM Roles, AWS Batch); - Custom Compute Resource (Launch Template or AMI) with Cromwell Additions.

For more details, please see [their official announcement](https://www.docker.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-chips-and-docker/). By extension, the absence of Docker means that Cromwell's local Docker backend is not yet supported. Even when Docker Desktop goes native on Apple Silicon, any tool images running on the local backend will need to cross-compile for the x86 and Arm architectures. This is because the Rosetta 2 translation layer [does not support virtualization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment).

Performance,"arly scheduled checkpoints. After an interruption, the task can be restarted from the last saved checkpoint, thereby avoiding having to re-run the entire computation again. ### Description. Specifying a `checkpointFile` value in a task's `runtime` section designates a checkpoint file which will periodically be; copied to cloud storage every 10 minutes. This checkpoint file will then be restored automatically on subsequent attempts if the job is interrupted. Once the final output has been successfully generated, the checkpoint file will be deleted. To use this feature effectively, the WDL task must be written intentionally to use the checkpoint file. See example below. . ### Effects on cloud charges. Charges will accrue from storing the checkpoint file during the running of the task, and additional charges may apply to the transfer between the VM and the cloud storage bucket depending on their locations. These costs should be minor, especially balanced against the performance and cost benefits of being able to restore from the checkpoint when a worker VM gets preempted. Since the checkpoint file is deleted after successful completion of the task, no further charges will accrue after completion. However, if the task is aborted or otherwise stopped externally, ie through interruption of Cromwell's operation, the checkpoint file will NOT be deleted and storage charges will continue to accrue indefinitely, or until the file is deleted manually. . ### Effect on Call Caching. The presence or absence of the `checkpointFile` attribute is not considered when determining whether to call cache. . ### Example. The following WDL demonstrates the use of the `checkpointFile` optimization. It has a command that is checkpoint-aware:. * It starts by attempting to restore state from the `my_checkpoint` file (or starts at `1` if the checkpoint is empty); * Then it counts up to 100, printing out the current counter value and a date timestamp at each value.

Cromwell will automatically run a database query during the upgrade which appears to be roughly linear to the number of rows in the METADATA_ENTRY table. You can estimate upgrade time using the following equation: `time to migrate (in seconds) ~= (rows in METADATA_ENTRY) / 65000` Note that due to differences in hardware and database speed, this is only a rough estimate. ### Config Changes. * Added a configuration option under `system.io` to throttle the number of I/O queries that Cromwell makes, as well as configure retry parameters.; This is mostly useful for the JES backend and should be updated to match the GCS quota available for the project. ```; system.io {; # Global Throttling - This is mostly useful for GCS and can be adjusted to match; # the quota availble on the GCS API; number-of-requests = 100000; per = 100 seconds. # Number of times an I/O operation should be attempted before giving up and failing it.; number-of-attempts = 5; }; ```. ## 25. ### External Contributors; * A special thank you to @adamstruck, @antonkulaga and @delocalizer for their contributions to Cromwell.; ### Breaking Changes. * Metadata keys for call caching are changed.

This logic is implemented using [Akka Coordinated Shutdown Extension](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/actors.html#coordinated-shutdown). Currently Cromwell is running [version 2.5.4](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.4/scala/actors.html#coordinated-shutdown).; It comes with a set of pre-defined phases, that can be added on and modified. Those phases can be linked together to form a Graph. Cromwell shutdown graphs looks as such:. ![Scaladoc](CromwellShutdownProcess.png). Pre-defined but unused phases have been omitted (cluster related phases for example that are irrelevant in Cromwell). You'll notice the presence of a `PhaseAbortAllWorkflows` phase. This phase is at the same level as the `PhaseServiceRequestsDone` phase which corresponds to our step #3 above.; The reason for a specific abort phase is so that its timeout can be configured differently than the normal shutdown phase. Indeed, stopping all workflows and aborting them is very similar from an outside perspective. We send a message (resp. ""Stop"" and ""Abort"") and wait for a response. In the case where you want to be able to give more time to abort, as it will likely involve more work, you can edit the value of `coordinated-shutdown.phases.abort-all-workflows.timeout` which defaults to 1 hour.; Phases timeouts default to 5 seconds, except the stop-io-activity phase which defaults to 30 minutes. This is because depending on the Database load at the time of the shutdown, it might take a significant amount of time to flush all pending writes. All of the timeouts are configurable in the `akka.coordinated-shutdown.phases` section ([see the latest `reference.conf`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akka/akka/master/akka-actor/src/main/resources/reference.conf)).; To change the default timeout, change the value of `akka.coordinated-shutdown.default-phase-timeout`.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md:9224,load,load,9224,docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,1,['load'],['load']

Performance,"be restricted among different users, it can be useful to limit; cache hits to those that are more likely to actually be readable for cache hit copies.; Cromwell now supports a `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` workflow option for this purpose. This is particularly useful in the PAPI backend where the workflow; root can be specified in workflow options via `jes_gcs_root`. The value of `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` should be an array of strings representing ; prefixes that call cache hit output files should have in order to be considered as a cache hit. Using PAPI as an example and assuming Alice and Bob have; made their data accessible to each other, Alice could submit a workflow with these options:. ```; {; ""call_cache_hit_path_prefixes"": [ ""gs://alice_bucket"", ""gs://bob_bucket"" ]; }; ```. With these workflow options Cromwell would only look for cache hits for Alice's jobs in Alice's or Bob's buckets. As a further optimization the PAPI backend has the concept of ""this"" bucket on a per-workflow basis, where ""this"" bucket is; the bucket that contains the current workflow root.; If `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` is specified in ; workflow options on the PAPI backend, Cromwell will automatically prepend ""this"" bucket to the call cache hit path prefixes to search.; For example, if Charles specified the same workflow options as in the example above and his workflow root was under `gs://charles_bucket`,; Cromwell would search cache hits in all of the `gs://alice_bucket`, `gs://bob_bucket` and `gs://charles_bucket` buckets without having to specify; `gs://charles_bucket` bucket explicitly in `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes`. If no `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` are specified then all matching cache hits will be considered. ***Call cache failure logging***. When Cromwell fails to cache a job from a previous result the reason will be logged. To reduce the verbosity of the logs; only the first three failure reasons will be logged per shard of each job.

Performance,"ble `job_id`:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; kill = ""qdel ${job_id}""; }; ```. #### How Cromwell checks if an HPC job is alive. Whenever Cromwell restarts it checks to see if a job has completed by searching for return code in a file called `rc`. If this file isn't available, in this case Cromwell runs an extra check to make sure the job is still alive. You can configure the command used for this check via:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; check-alive = ""qstat -j ${job_id}""; }; ```. #### Other backend settings. On some systems, the administrators may limit the number of HPC jobs a user may run at a time. To configure this limit, you can use the value `concurrent-job-limit` to limit the number of jobs. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; concurrent-job-limit = 100; }; ```. #### Putting the config section all together. With the above sections, we can combine them all together to create a completly working HPC backend. ```hocon; backend {; default = SGE; ; providers {; SGE {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; concurrent-job-limit = 100; ; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int cpu = 1; Float? memory_gb; String? sge_queue; String? sge_project; """"""; ; submit = """"""; qsub \; -terse \; -V \; -b y \; -N ${job_name} \; -wd ${cwd} \; -o ${out} \; -e ${err} \; -pe smp ${cpu} \; ${""-l mem_free="" + memory_gb + ""g""} \; ${""-q "" + sge_queue} \; ${""-P "" + sge_project} \; /usr/bin/env bash ${script}; """""". job-id-regex = ""(\\d+)"". kill = ""qdel ${job_id}""; check-alive = ""qstat -j ${job_id}""; }; }; }; }; ```.

While this instrumentation support can be used in smaller environments it will still require setting up a; [StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd) server outside of Cromwell and it's possible not enough data would be produced to be useful. ; Cromwell collects metrics while running and sends them to an internal service. .

There is also an additional configuration value that can be set: . ```hocon; # Rate at which Cromwell updates its gauge values (number of workflows running, queued, etc...); system.instrumentation-rate = 5 seconds; ```. If you have multiple Cromwell instances, and would like to separate the instrumentation path for each instance, set the `system.cromwell_id` with the unique identifier for each Cromwell instance. For example,; ```hocon; system.cromwell_id = ""cromwell-instance-1""; ```; will prepend all the metrics with path `cromwell.cromwell-instance-1...` for that instance. ##### Metrics.

All actors generating data that needs to be persisted receive a message asking them to gracefully stop.; This means that they are given some time (see below for how much and how to change it) to return to a known ""consistent"" state.; For example, an actor waiting for a response from the database before sending information to the metadata will wait for that response before shutting itself down.; 4.

Performance,"d. To use this feature effectively, the WDL task must be written intentionally to use the checkpoint file. See example below. . ### Effects on cloud charges. Charges will accrue from storing the checkpoint file during the running of the task, and additional charges may apply to the transfer between the VM and the cloud storage bucket depending on their locations. These costs should be minor, especially balanced against the performance and cost benefits of being able to restore from the checkpoint when a worker VM gets preempted. Since the checkpoint file is deleted after successful completion of the task, no further charges will accrue after completion. However, if the task is aborted or otherwise stopped externally, ie through interruption of Cromwell's operation, the checkpoint file will NOT be deleted and storage charges will continue to accrue indefinitely, or until the file is deleted manually. . ### Effect on Call Caching. The presence or absence of the `checkpointFile` attribute is not considered when determining whether to call cache. . ### Example. The following WDL demonstrates the use of the `checkpointFile` optimization. It has a command that is checkpoint-aware:. * It starts by attempting to restore state from the `my_checkpoint` file (or starts at `1` if the checkpoint is empty); * Then it counts up to 100, printing out the current counter value and a date timestamp at each value. To make the checkpointing work, the `runtime` section specifies `checkpointFile: ""my_checkpoint""`. ```wdl; version 1.0. workflow count_wf {; # Count to 2100 at 1/second => 35 minutes to complete, but; # luckily the state can be checkpointed every 10 minutes in; # case of preemption: ; call count { input: count_to = 2100 }; }. task count {; input {; Int count_to; }. command <<<; # Note: Cromwell will stage the checkpoint file on recovery attempts.; # This task checks the 'my_checkpoint' file for a counter value, or else; # initializes the counter at '1':; FROM_CKPT=$(cat my_ch",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/optimizations/CheckpointFiles.md:1874,cache,cache,1874,docs/optimizations/CheckpointFiles.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/optimizations/CheckpointFiles.md,1,['cache'],['cache']

When Cromwell runs a task, it will fill in a template for the job using the declared runtime attributes. This specific template will vary depending on the requirements of your HPC cluster. For example, say you normally submit jobs to SGE using:. ```bash; qsub -terse -V -b y -N my_job_name \; -wd /path/to/working_directory \; -o /path/to/stdout.qsub \; -e /path/to/stderr.qsub \; -pe smp 1 -l mem_free=0.5g -q short \; /usr/bin/env bash myScript.bash; ```. For this particular SGE cluster, the above sets the working directory, stdout and stderr paths, the number of cpus to 1, the memory to half a gigabyte, and runs on the short queue. Converting this into a template using our runtime attributes requires defining `submit` as one would a WDL task `command`:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; submit = """"""; qsub \; -terse \; -V \; -b y \; -N ${job_name} \; -wd ${cwd} \; -o ${out}.qsub \; -e ${err}.qsub \; -pe smp ${cpu} \; ${""-l mem_free="" + memory_gb + ""g""} \; ${""-q "" + sge_queue} \; ${""-P "" + sge_project} \; /usr/bin/env bash ${script}; """"""; }; ```. When the job finishes submitting, Cromwell will need to retrieve the job id, so that it can abort the job if necessary. This job should be written to the stdout after submission, where Cromwell will then read the job id. Because the job id may be surrounded by other text, a custom regular expression should capture the actual job id. Because the submit above uses `-terse`, the job id will be the entire contents of the stdout, but should be all digits:. ```hocon; backend.provid",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md:5732,queue,queue,5732,docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md,2,['queue'],['queue']

Additionally, if any files from a previous job directory are removed, call caching will fail due to missing files. ***File hash caching***. Cromwell offers the option to cache file hashes within the scope of a root workflow to prevent repeatedly requesting the hashes of the; same files multiple times. File hash caching is off by default and can be turned on with the configuration option `system.file-hash-cache=true`. ***Call cache blacklisting***; Cromwell offers the ability to filter cache hits based on copying failures. . Call cache blacklisting configuration looks like:. ```; call-caching {. enabled = true. # In a multi-user environment this should be false so unauthorized users don't invalidate results for authorized users. ; invalidate-bad-cache-results = false. blacklist-cache {; # The call caching blacklist cache is off by default.

For the Google backend the `jes_gcs_root` [Workflow Option](../wf_options/Google) will take; precedence over the `root` specified at `backend.providers.JES.config.root` in the configuration file. Google Cloud Storage URIs are the only acceptable values for `File` inputs for; workflows using the Google backend. **Pipeline timeout**. Google sets a default pipeline timeout of 7 days, after which the pipeline will abort. Setting `pipeline-timeout` overrides this limit to a maximum of 30 days. ```hocon; backend.providers.PAPIv2.config {; pipeline-timeout: 14 days; }; ```. #### Quota retry. Typically, Life Sciences API is designed to accept all jobs sent to it and respond to quota exhaustion; by queueing jobs internally. However, there are cases when jobs fail instead of queueing, with messages such; as ""PAPI error code 9"", ""no available zones"", and/or ""quota too low"".

To allow Cromwell to talk to AWS, the `default` authentication scheme uses the [default authentication provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html) with the following AWS search paths:; - Environment Variables - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`; - Java system properties - `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretKey`; - Default credential profiles file - Created by the AWS CLI, typically located at `~/.aws/credentials`; - _Instance profile credentials_ - Only relevant on EC2 instances. ### Allowing private Docker containers. AWS Batch allows the use of private Docker containers by providing `dockerhub` credentials. Under the specific backend's configuration, you can provide the following object:. ```hocon; (backend.providers.AWSBatch.config.)dockerhub = {; // account = """"; // token = """"; }; ```. ### More configuration options. * `(backend.providers.AWSBatch.config.)concurrent-job-limit` specifies the number of jobs that Cromwell will allow to be running in AWS at the same time. Tune this parameter based on how many nodes are in the compute environment.; * `(backend.providers.AWSBatch.config.)root` points to the S3 bucket where workflow outputs are stored.

Performance,"ead of re-running it. Cromwell's call cache is maintained in its database. In order for call caching to be used on any previously run jobs,; it is best to configure Cromwell to [point to a MySQL database](../Configuring.md#database) instead of the default; in-memory database. This way any invocation of Cromwell (either with `run` or `server` subcommands) will be able to; utilize results from all calls that are in that database. **Configuring Call Caching**. *Call Caching is disabled by default.* Call Caching can be enabled in your Cromwell; [Configuration](../Configuring.md#call-caching) and the behavior can be modified via; [Workflow Options](../wf_options/Overview.md). If you are adding Workflow options, do not set; [`read_from_cache` or `write_to_cache`](../wf_options/Overview.md#call-caching-options) = false, as it will impact the; following process. Once enabled, Cromwell by default will search the call cache for every `call` statement invocation. * If there was no cache hit, the `call` will be executed as normal. Once finished it will add itself to the cache.; * If there was a cache hit, outputs are either **copied from the original cached job to the new job's output directory**; or **referenced from the original cached job** depending on the Cromwell; [Configuration](../Configuring.md#call-caching) settings. > **Note:** If call caching is enabled, be careful not to change the contents of the output directory for any previously run job. Doing so might cause cache hits in Cromwell to copy over modified data and Cromwell currently does not check that the contents of the output directory changed. Additionally, if any files from a previous job directory are removed, call caching will fail due to missing files. ***File hash caching***. Cromwell offers the option to cache file hashes within the scope of a root workflow to prevent repeatedly requesting the hashes of the; same files multiple times.

Remember; that one day you might need to support this code!. ### Reviewing the Concept. Ask the questions:; ; - Will Cromwell be a better product with this change adopted. ; - Will it be better enough to warrant the time necessary to review the PR; - Note: The answer to this is almost always a yes if the first answer was yes; - However, overly long, opaque, or ""risky"" changes might benefit from requests to break the PR up and merge/review things in stages. ; ; ### Review the changes in the PR. - For PRs changing ""supported"" features, treat it like any other PR coming from within the team.; - Remember: we will have to support these changes in the future. Possibly forever!; - For PRs only making changes to features we don't officially support - be generous. But make sure:; - That any new optional functionality is opt-in rather than becoming the default.; - That any community features are flagged in documentation and config examples as originating from the community (and thus may not be supported by the team if bugs are found).; ; ### Run CI against the PR. - Opening a PR triggers CI to run automatically. However, if the PR was not opened by a trusted contributor, it will wait in a Github Actions queue until a trusted contributor explicitly allows CI tests run. ### Cycle through Review and CI. - If the community contributor makes changes following your reviews or the CI results:; - Glance at the changes to make sure they still seem reasonable.; - Make any additional comments; - Rerun CI.; ; ### Merge the PR. - Once the tests have completed successfully and the PR has two approvals, it can be merged.; - Remember to delete your branch clone PR (and the cloned branch itself too!).

The primary keys of Cromwell's job store tables have been refactored to use a `BIGINT` datatype in place of the previous; `INT` datatype. Cromwell will not be usable during the time the Liquibase migration for this refactor is running.; In the Google Cloud SQL with SSD environment this migration runs at a rate of approximately 40,000 `JOB_STORE_SIMPLETON_ENTRY`; rows per second. In deployments with millions or billions of `JOB_STORE_SIMPLETON_ENTRY` rows the migration may require; a significant amount of downtime so please plan accordingly.

This release adopts updated libraries to ensure uninterrupted operation. The only user action required is upgrading Cromwell. ### Bug fixes. * Fixed a bug that required Cromwell to be restarted in order to pick up DNS changes.; * By default, the JVM caches DNS records with a TTL of infinity.; * Cromwell now configures its JVM with a 3-minute TTL. This value can be customized by setting `system.dns-cache-ttl`.; * Clarified an error message that Cromwell emits when the compute backend terminates a job of its own volition (as opposed to termination in response to an abort request from Cromwell); * Previously, the error read `The job was aborted from outside Cromwell`; * The new error reads `The compute backend terminated the job.

Within the configuration file, you can specify the workflow option that will determine the hog group. The default is; `hogGroup`. So if a workflow arrives with the following workflow options file, Cromwell will assign `hogGroupA` as the ; workflow's hog group:. ```json; {; ""hogGroup"": ""hogGroupA""; }; ```. - Any workflow option value can be used so long as it is a simple `String` value:; + You can come up with a new field and set it specifically for assigning hog groups.; + You can choose a field that is already being used for other reasons; - If a workflow is submitted without a value for the designated field in its workflow options, the workflow ID is used ; as the hog group identifier. . ### Logging. Because the system is not a simple first-in-first-out, it can be valuable to see the status of all ; the existing queues inside Cromwell. . To have this information logged on a regular basis, you can enable periodic queue logging. This will; also alert you at the same frequency when events are happening, such as hog groups being at their individual limits. * You can enable logging for the Job Execution Token Dispenser, using; the `system.hog-safety.token-log-interval-seconds` configuration value.; * The default, `0`, means that no logging will occur. ## Effects. ### Job Execution. #### Reserving Space. - Cromwell allows administrators to designate an overall maximum concurrent job limit per; [backend](../backends/Backends.md#backend-job-limits). ; - Within that limit, a hog factor allows us to limit the maximum concurrent jobs started *per hog group*.; + This is what allows new jobs to run immediately even if many jobs from bigger workflows are already queued up. #### Round robin allocation.

While the default is to launch up to `1` workflow, you can override this by setting:. ```hocon; system.max-workflow-launch-count = 1; ```. ***Abort configuration***. Cromwell will scan for abort requests using default configuration values equivalent to those below. In most circumstances; there shouldn't be a need to override these defaults. ```hocon; system {; abort {; # How frequently Cromwell should scan for aborts.; scan-frequency: 30 seconds. # The cache of in-progress aborts. Cromwell will add entries to this cache once a WorkflowActor has been messaged to abort.; # If on the next scan an 'Aborting' status is found for a workflow that has an entry in this cache, Cromwell will not ask; # the associated WorkflowActor to abort again.; cache {; # Guava cache concurrency.; concurrency: 1; # How long entries in the cache should live from the time they are added to the cache.; ttl: 20 minutes; # Maximum number of entries in the cache.; size: 100000; }; }; }; ```. ### Database. **Using a MySQL Database**. Cromwell tracks the execution of workflows and stores outputs of task invocations in a SQL database. Cromwell supports either an external MySQL database, or a temporary in-memory database. By default, Cromwell uses an in-memory database which will only live for the duration of the JVM. This provides a quick way to run workflows locally without having to set up MySQL, though it also makes workflow executions somewhat transient. To configure Cromwell to instead point to a MySQL database, first create the empty database. In the example below, the database name is `cromwell`. Then, edit your configuration file `database` stanza, as follows:. ```hocon; database {; profile = ""slick.jdbc.MySQLProfile$""; db {; driver = ""com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver""; url = ""jdbc:mysql://host/cromwell?rewriteBatchedStatements=true""; u",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md:5312,concurren,concurrency,5312,docs/Configuring.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md,3,"['cache', 'concurren']","['cache', 'concurrency']"

For more information see; [create_images.sh](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/develop/scripts/reference_disks/create_images.sh). ### Docker Image Cache Support. To optimize job execution time, Cromwell 55 and later support the use of Docker image caches on the PAPI v2 lifesciences beta backend. Docker image caches are not available on the PAPI v2 genomics alpha backend.; Configuration looks like:. ```hocon; backend {; ...; providers {; ...; PapiV2 {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.google.pipelines.v2beta.PipelinesApiLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; ...; docker-image-cache-manifest-file = ""gs://path/to/a/docker/image/cache/manifest.json""; ...; }; }; }; }; ```. Docker image cache manifest JSONs have a format like:. ```json; {; ""biocontainers/samtools:1.3.1"": ""projects/broad-dsde-cromwell-dev/global/images/v1-docker-biocontainers-samtools-1-3-1"",; ""gcr.io/gcp-runtimes/ubuntu_16_0_4:latest"": ""projects/broad-dsde-cromwell-dev/global/images/v1-docker-gcr-io-gcp-runtimes-ubuntu-16-0-4-latest"",; ...; }; ```. Docker image cache usage is an opt-in feature, so workflow submissions must specify this workflow option:. ```json; {; ...; ""use_docker_image_cache"": true,; ...; }; ```. Individual tasks within a workflow can turn off Docker image caching through the use of a runtime attribute:. ```wdl; task my_task {; ...; runtime {; ...; useDockerImageCache: false; }; }; ```. If Cromwell is running a workflow on PAPI v2 beta with Docker image caching enabled and a task specifies a; Docker image which corresponds to a configured Docker image cache JSON, Cromwell will arrange for the; job's VM to mount a disk built from the corresponding disk image.

By default Cromwell's blacklist caches work at the granularity of root workflows, but Cromwell can also be configured to; share a blacklist cache among a group of workflows. ; If a value is specified for `call-caching.blacklisting.groupings.workflow-option` and a workflow option is specified; having a matching key, all workflows specifying the same value will share a blacklist cache. . For example, if Cromwell configuration contains `call-caching.blacklisting.groupings.workflow-option = ""project""` and; a workflow is submitted with the options. ```json; {; ""project"": ""Mary""; }; ```. then this workflow will share a blacklist cache with any other workflows whose workflow options contain `""project"": ""Mary""`. Grouping of blacklist caches can significantly improve blacklisting effectiveness and overall call caching performance.; Workflows should be grouped by their effective authorization to ensure the same filesystem/object store permissions; exist for every workflow in the group. **** Hit blacklisting ****. If a cache hit fails copying for any reason, Cromwell will record that failure in the blacklist cache and will not use; the hit again. Hit blacklisting is particularly effective at improving call caching performance in conjunction with the ; grouping feature described above. **** Path prefix (GCS bucket) blacklisting on 403 Forbidden errors ****. In a multi-user environment user A might cache hit to one of user B's results; but that doesn't necessarily mean user A is authorized to read user B's outputs from the filesystem.

Cromwell now allows for a user to submit the URL pointing to workflow file to run a workflow.; More details on how to use it in:; - `Server` mode can be found [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/api/RESTAPI/).; - `Run` mode can be found [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/CommandLine/#run). ### Languages. - Added an opt-in namespace cache for the WDL Draft 2 language factory. Please see the Cromwell example configuration for details. NOTE: if upgrading from a hotfix version of Cromwell; that relied upon this cache, the cache is now opt-in and must be turned on explicitly in config.; - To maintain conformance with the OpenWDL spec, Cromwell drops support for the `version draft-3` identifier in this release. In the rare case where end users may have been using `version draft-3`, `version 1.0` is a drop-in replacement with no effect on functionality. ### HTTP Workflow Inputs for Shared File System and Google Pipelines API Version 2 Backends. `http` and `https` workflow inputs are now supported for shared filesystem and Google Pipelines API (PAPI) version 2; backends. Configuration details are described [here](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/filesystems/HTTP). ### Call cache hint support. More efficient cache hit copying in multi-user environments is now supported through the `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` workflow option.; Details [here](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/CallCaching/#call-cache-hit-path-prefixes). ### Root workflow level file hash caching support.

Performance,"er potential exit codes.; - Fixes error message reporting for failed jobs.; - Fixes the ""retry with more memory"" feature.; - Fixes the reference disk feature.; - Fixes pulling Docker image metadata from private GCR repositories.; - Fixed `google_project` and `google_compute_service_account` workflow options not taking effect when using GCP Batch backend; - Added a way to use a custom LogsPolicy for the job execution, setting `backend.providers.batch.config.batch.logs-policy` to ""CLOUD_LOGGING"" (default) keeps the current behavior, or, set it to ""PATH"" to save the logs into the the mounted disk, at the end, this log file gets copied to the google cloud storage bucket with ""task.log"" as the name.; - When ""CLOUD_LOGGING"" is used, many more Cromwell / WDL labels for workflow, root workflow, call, shard etc. are now assigned to GCP Batch log entries. ### Improved handling of Life Sciences API quota errors. Users reported cases where Life Sciences jobs failed due to insufficient quota, instead of queueing and waiting until; quota is available (which is the expected behavior). Cromwell will now retry under these conditions, which present with errors; such as ""PAPI error code 9"", ""no available zones"", and/or ""quota too low"". ### Database. #### New table 'GROUP_METRICS_ENTRY'. A new table called `GROUP_METRICS_ENTRY` has been added. The purpose of this table is to track when a group or billing project last ran into Cloud Quota exhaustion. #### Index removal. The `IX_WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY_WS` index is removed from `WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY`. The index had low cardinality and workflow pickup is faster without it. Migration time depends on workflow store size, but should be very fast for most installations. Terminal workflows are removed from the workflow store, so only running workflows contribute to the cost. ### Bug fixes. #### Improved `size()` function performance on arrays. Resolved a hotspot in Cromwell to make the `size()` engine function perform much faster on file arrays.

This number (more precisely the number of attempts that will be made) can be set using the following configuration option:. ```; system.io {; number-of-attempts = 5; }; ```. ### Workflows. **Max Concurrent Workflows**. Cromwell has a configurable cap on the number of workflows running at a time. You can adjust the limit from the default `5000` by setting:. ```hocon; system.max-concurrent-workflows = 5000; ```. **New Workflow Poll Rate**. Cromwell will look for new workflows to start on a regular interval, configured as a number of seconds. You can change the polling rate from the default `20` seconds by editing the value:. ```hocon; system.new-workflow-poll-rate = 20; ```. **Max Workflow Launch Count**. On every poll, Cromwell will take at limited number of new submissions, provided there are new workflows to launch and the `system.max-concurrent-workflows` number has not been reached. While the default is to launch up to `1` workflow, you can override this by setting:. ```hocon; system.max-workflow-launch-count = 1; ```. ***Abort configuration***. Cromwell will scan for abort requests using default configuration values equivalent to those below. In most circumstances; there shouldn't be a need to override these defaults. ```hocon; system {; abort {; # How frequently Cromwell should scan for aborts.; scan-frequency: 30 seconds. # The cache of in-progress aborts. Cromwell will add entries to this cache once a WorkflowActor has been messaged to abort.; # If on the next scan an 'Aborting' status is found for a workflow that has an entry in this cache, Cromwell will not ask; # the associated WorkflowActor to abort again.; cache {; # Guava cache concurrency.; concurrency: 1; # How long entries in the cache should live from the time they are added to the cache.; ttl: 20 minutes; # Maximum number of entries in the cache.; size: 100000; }; }; }; `",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md:4477,concurren,concurrent-workflows,4477,docs/Configuring.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md,1,['concurren'],['concurrent-workflows']
Performance,"example below. . ### Effects on cloud charges. Charges will accrue from storing the checkpoint file during the running of the task, and additional charges may apply to the transfer between the VM and the cloud storage bucket depending on their locations. These costs should be minor, especially balanced against the performance and cost benefits of being able to restore from the checkpoint when a worker VM gets preempted. Since the checkpoint file is deleted after successful completion of the task, no further charges will accrue after completion. However, if the task is aborted or otherwise stopped externally, ie through interruption of Cromwell's operation, the checkpoint file will NOT be deleted and storage charges will continue to accrue indefinitely, or until the file is deleted manually. . ### Effect on Call Caching. The presence or absence of the `checkpointFile` attribute is not considered when determining whether to call cache. . ### Example. The following WDL demonstrates the use of the `checkpointFile` optimization. It has a command that is checkpoint-aware:. * It starts by attempting to restore state from the `my_checkpoint` file (or starts at `1` if the checkpoint is empty); * Then it counts up to 100, printing out the current counter value and a date timestamp at each value. To make the checkpointing work, the `runtime` section specifies `checkpointFile: ""my_checkpoint""`. ```wdl; version 1.0. workflow count_wf {; # Count to 2100 at 1/second => 35 minutes to complete, but; # luckily the state can be checkpointed every 10 minutes in; # case of preemption: ; call count { input: count_to = 2100 }; }. task count {; input {; Int count_to; }. command <<<; # Note: Cromwell will stage the checkpoint file on recovery attempts.; # This task checks the 'my_checkpoint' file for a counter value, or else; # initializes the counter at '1':; FROM_CKPT=$(cat my_checkpoint | tail -n1 | awk '{ print $1 }'); FROM_CKPT=${FROM_CKPT:-1}. echo '--' >> my_checkpoint; for i in $(seq",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/optimizations/CheckpointFiles.md:1959,optimiz,optimization,1959,docs/optimizations/CheckpointFiles.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/optimizations/CheckpointFiles.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Performance,"f work to do (tasks) as well as the; dependencies and code flow between them. When it comes to actually executing the specific task, Cromwell delegates that; work to a “backend”. A backend is therefore responsible for the actual execution of a single task on some underlying; computing platform, such as Google Cloud Platform, AWS, TES, Local, etc. Backends are implemented as a software layer; between the Cromwell engine and that underlying platform. The underlying platform services requests for a job to run while the backend shim provides the interface layer between; Cromwell and the platform. In general, the more sophisticated the platform the thinner the shim needs to be and vice; versa. A job from Cromwell’s perspective is a collection of the following information:. * A unix command line to run; * A mapping of where its input files currently live to where the command line expects them to be; * A mapping of where the command line will write its outputs to where they should eventually wind up; * An optional Docker image which if supplied will be the environment in which the command will be run; * A collection of arbitrary key/value pairs which can be used by the execution platform to tune the request, e.g. amount; of memory or the number of CPUs. The Docker image is not required for a backend but is highly recommended. The bioinformatics workflow field is rapidly; moving towards a Docker model so one will find better support for their backend if it is built around using Docker; containers. The input/output file mappings will depend on the needs of the platform. In the simplest example these values would be; identical, living on a shared filesystem. However an example of where this would be useful would be a model where an; input file lives in a cloud bucket and is directly copied onto the machine running the command line followed by copying; the program’s outputs back to a cloud bucket.

The older names are still supported in Cromwell 28 with deprecation warnings but will; be removed in a future version of Cromwell. ### Labels; * A new `/labels` endpoint has been added to update labels for an existing workflow. See the [README](README.md#patch-apiworkflowsversionidlabels) for more information.; * Label formatting requirements have been updated, please check the [README](README.md#label-format) for more detailed documentation. ### JES Backend. The JES backend now supports a `filesystems.gcs.caching.duplication-strategy` configuration entry.; It can be set to specify the desired behavior of Cromwell regarding call outputs when a call finds a hit in the cache.; The default value is `copy` which will copy all output files to the new call directory.; A second value is allowed, `reference`, that will instead point to the original output files, without copying them. ```hocon; filesystems {; gcs {; auth = ""application-default"". caching {; duplication-strategy = ""reference""; }; }; }; ```. A placeholder file will be placed in the execution folder of the cached call to explain the absence of output files and point to the location of the original ones. ### Metadata Write Batching. Metadata write batching works the same as in previous versions of Cromwell, but the default batch size has been changed from 1 to 200. It's possible that 200 is too high in some environments, but 200 is more likely to be an appropriate value; than the previous default. ## 27. ### Migration. * Call Caching has been improved in this version of Cromwell, specifically the time needed to determine whether or not a job ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:87657,cache,cache,87657,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['cache'],['cache']

Cromwell previously supported blacklisting GCS buckets containing cache hits which could not be copied for permissions; reasons. Cromwell now adds support for blacklisting individual cache hits which could not be copied for any reason,; as well as grouping blacklist caches according to a workflow option key. More information available in the [; call caching documentation]( https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Configuring/#call-caching). #### new xxh64 and fingerprint strategies for call caching.

Doing so might cause cache hits in Cromwell to copy over modified data and Cromwell currently does not check that the contents of the output directory changed.

Performance,"g used for other reasons; - If a workflow is submitted without a value for the designated field in its workflow options, the workflow ID is used ; as the hog group identifier. . ### Logging. Because the system is not a simple first-in-first-out, it can be valuable to see the status of all ; the existing queues inside Cromwell. . To have this information logged on a regular basis, you can enable periodic queue logging. This will; also alert you at the same frequency when events are happening, such as hog groups being at their individual limits. * You can enable logging for the Job Execution Token Dispenser, using; the `system.hog-safety.token-log-interval-seconds` configuration value.; * The default, `0`, means that no logging will occur. ## Effects. ### Job Execution. #### Reserving Space. - Cromwell allows administrators to designate an overall maximum concurrent job limit per; [backend](../backends/Backends.md#backend-job-limits). ; - Within that limit, a hog factor allows us to limit the maximum concurrent jobs started *per hog group*.; + This is what allows new jobs to run immediately even if many jobs from bigger workflows are already queued up. #### Round robin allocation. Rather than starting jobs on a strict first-come first served basis, Cromwell now assigns in a round-robin; fashion between hog groups and then on a first-come-first-served *within* a hog group. In other words if the hog groups had the following entries queued up:; ```; A: jobA1, jobA2, jobA3, ..., jobA1000000; B: jobB1, jobB2; C: jobC1; D: jobD1, jobD2; ```. Then Cromwell would start the jobs in the following order, even though `jobA1000000` was added before `jobD1`:; ```; jobA1, jobB1, jobC1, jobD1, jobA2, jobB2, jobD2, jobA3, ..., jobA1000000; ```. #### Example: How job execution is affected by hog factors. ##### An administrator sets up a Cromwell server. - A Cromwell administrator sets the overall maximum concurrent job limit to 100,000 PAPIv2 jobs.; - The administrator also sets the ho",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md:4832,concurren,concurrent,4832,docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md,1,['concurren'],['concurrent']

Possible values are ""local"" and ""remote""; # ""local"": Lookup hashes on the local docker daemon using the cli; # ""remote"": Lookup hashes on docker hub, gcr, gar, quay; #method = ""remote""; }; }; ```. ### Best Practices. #### Image Versions. When choosing the image version for your pipeline stages, it is highly recommended that you use a hash rather than a tag, for the sake of reproducibility; For example, in WDL, you could do this:; ```wdl; runtime {; docker: 'ubuntu:latest'; }; ```.

Performance,"ge the polling rate from the default `20` seconds by editing the value:. ```hocon; system.new-workflow-poll-rate = 20; ```. **Max Workflow Launch Count**. On every poll, Cromwell will take at limited number of new submissions, provided there are new workflows to launch and the `system.max-concurrent-workflows` number has not been reached. While the default is to launch up to `1` workflow, you can override this by setting:. ```hocon; system.max-workflow-launch-count = 1; ```. ***Abort configuration***. Cromwell will scan for abort requests using default configuration values equivalent to those below. In most circumstances; there shouldn't be a need to override these defaults. ```hocon; system {; abort {; # How frequently Cromwell should scan for aborts.; scan-frequency: 30 seconds. # The cache of in-progress aborts. Cromwell will add entries to this cache once a WorkflowActor has been messaged to abort.; # If on the next scan an 'Aborting' status is found for a workflow that has an entry in this cache, Cromwell will not ask; # the associated WorkflowActor to abort again.; cache {; # Guava cache concurrency.; concurrency: 1; # How long entries in the cache should live from the time they are added to the cache.; ttl: 20 minutes; # Maximum number of entries in the cache.; size: 100000; }; }; }; ```. ### Database. **Using a MySQL Database**. Cromwell tracks the execution of workflows and stores outputs of task invocations in a SQL database. Cromwell supports either an external MySQL database, or a temporary in-memory database. By default, Cromwell uses an in-memory database which will only live for the duration of the JVM. This provides a quick way to run workflows locally without having to set up MySQL, though it also makes workflow executions somewhat transient. To configure Cromwell to instead point to a MySQL database, first create the empty database. In the example below, the database name is `cromwell`.

Read the [Abort](execution/ExecutionTwists/#abort) section to learn more about how abort works. ### Call caching. Call Caching allows Cromwell to detect when a job has been run in the past so it doesn't have to re-compute results. ; To learn more see [Call Caching](cromwell_features/CallCaching). To enable Call Caching, add the following to your Cromwell configuration:. ```; call-caching {; enabled = true; invalidate-bad-cache-results = true; }; ```. When `call-caching.enabled=true` (default: `false`), Cromwell will be able to to reference or copy results from previously run jobs (when appropriate).; When `invalidate-bad-cache-results=true` (default: `true`), Cromwell will invalidate any cache results which contain files that cannot be accessed within a cache-hit. This is usually desired, but might be unwanted if this failure occurs for external reasons, such as a difference in user authentication. Cromwell also accepts [Workflow Options](wf_options/Overview#call-caching-options) to override the cache read/write behavior. . ### Local filesystem options.

On Google Pipelines API v2, a worker VM that is preempted may emit a generic error message like; ```; PAPI error code 10. The assigned worker has failed to complete the operation; ```; instead of a preemption-specific message like; ```; PAPI error code 14. Task was preempted for the 2nd time.; ```; Cromwell 44 introduced special handling that detects both preemption indicators and re-runs the job consistent with the `preemptible` setting. Cromwell 46 enhances this handling in response to user reports of possible continued issues. ## 45 Release Notes. ### Improved input and output transfer performance on PAPI v2. Cromwell now requires only a single PAPI ""action"" each for the entire localization or delocalization process, rather than two per file or directory.; This greatly increases execution speed for jobs with large numbers of input or output files.; In testing, total execution time for a call with 800 inputs improved from more than 70 minutes to less than 20 minutes. ### List dependencies flag in Womtool Command Line [(#5098)](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/5098).

This backend makes the same assumption about the filesystem that the local backend does: the Cromwell process and the jobs both have read/write access to the CWD of the job. The CWD will contain a `script.sh` file which will contain the same contents as the Local backend:. ```; #!/bin/sh; cd <container_call_root>; <user_command>; echo $? > rc; ```. The job is launched with a configurable script command such as:. ```; chmod 755 ${script}; cat > ${cwd}/execution/submitFile <<EOF; Iwd=${cwd}/execution; requirements=${nativeSpecs}; leave_in_queue=true; request_memory=${memory_mb}; request_disk=${disk_kb}; error=${err}; output=${out}; log_xml=true; request_cpus=${cpu}; executable=${script}; log=${cwd}/execution/execution.log; queue; EOF; condor_submit ${cwd}/execution/submitFile; ```. The HtCondor backend gets the job ID from parsing the `submit.stdout` text file. Since the `script.sh` ends with `echo $? > rc`, the backend will wait for the existence of this file, parse out the return code and determine success or failure and then subsequently post-process.

As a further optimization the PAPI backend has the concept of ""this"" bucket on a per-workflow basis, where ""this"" bucket is; the bucket that contains the current workflow root.; If `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` is specified in ; workflow options on the PAPI backend, Cromwell will automatically prepend ""this"" bucket to the call cache hit path prefixes to search.; For example, if Charles specified the same workflow options as in the example above and his workflow root was under `gs://charles_bucket`,; Cromwell would search cache hits in all of the `gs://alice_bucket`, `gs://bob_bucket` and `gs://charles_bucket` buckets without having to specify; `gs://charles_bucket` bucket explicitly in `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes`. If no `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` are specified then all matching cache hits will be considered. ***Call cache failure logging***. When Cromwell fails to cache a job from a previous result the reason will be logged. To reduce the verbosity of the logs; only the first three failure reasons will be logged per shard of each job. Cromwell will continue to try copying; previous results for the call, and when no candidates are left Cromwell will run the job on the backend. **Docker Tags**. Certain Docker tags can impact call caching performance. ; Docker tags are a convenient way to point to a version of an image (`ubuntu:14.04`), or even the latest version (`ubuntu:latest`).; For that purpose, tags are mutable, meaning that the image they point to can change, while the tag name stays the same.; While this is very convenient in some cases, using mutable, or ""floating"" tags in tasks affects the reproducibility of a workflow. ; If you were to run the same workflow using `ubuntu:latest` now, and again in a year (or even in a month) may run with different docker images.; This has an even bigger impact when",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md:7828,cache,cache,7828,docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,1,['cache'],['cache']

Memory, CPU and docker will always have their default cache-consideration behavior.; * Note: Unlike memory, cpu and docker attributes which inherit validation and hash-lookup behavior, any custom attributes will be simple primitive comparisons.; * For example, a `docker` attribute will be cached by looking up docker hashes against a docker repository, but a custom `singularity` attribute would be a primitive string match. #### How Cromwell should start an HPC job. When Cromwell runs a task, it will fill in a template for the job using the declared runtime attributes. This specific template will vary depending on the requirements of your HPC cluster. For example, say you normally submit jobs to SGE using:. ```bash; qsub -terse -V -b y -N my_job_name \; -wd /path/to/working_directory \; -o /path/to/stdout.qsub \; -e /path/to/stderr.qsub \; -pe smp 1 -l mem_free=0.5g -q short \; /usr/bin/env bash myScript.bash; ```. For this particular SGE cluster, the above sets the working directory, stdout and stderr paths, the number of cpus to 1, the memory to half a gigabyte, and runs on the short queue. Converting this into a template using our runtime attributes requires defining `submit` as one would a WDL task `command`:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; submit = """"""; qsub \; -terse \; -V \; -b y \; -N ${job_name} ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md:4921,cache,cached,4921,docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md,2,['cache'],['cached']

By default Cromwell's blacklist caches work at the granularity of root workflows, but Cromwell can also be configured to; share a blacklist cache among a group of workflows. ; If a value is specified for `call-caching.blacklisting.groupings.workflow-option` and a workflow option is specified; having a matching key, all workflows specifying the same value will share a blacklist cache. . For example, if Cromwell configuration contains `call-caching.blacklisting.groupings.workflow-option = ""project""` and; a workflow is submitted with the options. ```json; {; ""project"": ""Mary""; }; ```. then this workflow will share a blacklist cache with any other workflows whose workflow options contain `""project"": ""Mary""`.

We also deprecated the setting `api.routeUnwrapped` as a part of this internal consistency effort. * **Call caching diff**; We updated the response format of the [callcaching/diff](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell#get-apiworkflowsversioncallcachingdiff) endpoint. ### Other changes. * **Cromwell server**; When running in server mode, Cromwell now attempts to gracefully shutdown after receiving a `SIGINT` (`Ctrl-C`) or `SIGTERM` (`kill`) signal. This means that Cromwell waits for all pending database writes before exiting, as long as you include `application.conf` at the top of your config file. You can find detailed information about how to configure this feature in the [Cromwell Wiki](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/wiki/DevZone#graceful-server-shutdown). * **Concurrent jobs**; You can now limit the number of concurrent jobs for any backend. Previously this was only possible in some backend implementations. Please see the [README](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell#backend-job-limits) for details. ### WDL. * **Optional WDL variables**; Empty optional WDL values are now rendered as the `null` JSON value instead of the JSON string `""null""` in the metadata and output endpoints. You do not need to migrate previous workflows. Workflows run on Cromwell 28 and prior will still render empty values as `""null""`. * **Empty WDL variables**; Cromwell now accepts `null` JSON values in the input file and coerces them as an empty WDL value. WDL variables must be declared optional in order to be supplied with a `null` JSON value. input.json; ```json; {; ""null_input_values.maybeString"": null,; ""null_input_values.arrayOfMaybeInts"": [1, 2, null, 4]; }; ```. workflow.wdl; ```; workflow null_input_values {; String? maybeString; Array[Int?] arrayOfMaybeInts; }; ```. ## 28. ### Bug Fixes. #### ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:83483,concurren,concurrent,83483,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['concurren'],['concurrent']

An example using the new format is:; ```; ""callCaching"": {; ""hit"": false,; ""effectiveCallCachingMode"": ""ReadAndWriteCache"",; ""result"": ""Cache Miss"",; ""allowResultReuse"": true; }; ```. ### Config Changes. * Added a field `insert-batch-size` to the `database` stanza which defines how many values from a batch insert will be processed at a time. This value defaults to 2000.; * Moved the config value `services.MetadataService.metadata-summary-refresh-interval` to `services.MetadataService.config.metadata-summary-refresh-interval`; * Added ability to override the default zone(s) used by JES via the config structure by setting `genomics.default-zones` in the JES configuration; * The cromwell server TCP binding timeout is now configurable via the config key `webservice.binding-timeout`, defaulted; to the previous value `5s` (five seconds) via the reference.conf.; * For MySQL users, a massive scalability improvement via batched DB writing of internal metadata events. Note that one must add `rewriteBatchedStatements=true` to their JDBC URL in their config in order to take advantage of this. ### General Changes. * Cromwell's WDL parser now recognizes empty array literals correctly, e.g. `Array[String] emptyArray = []`.; * Cromwell now applies default labels automatically to JES pipeline runs.; * Added support for new WDL functions:; * `length: (Array[X]) => Integer` - report the length of the specified array; * `prefix: (String, Array[X]) => Array[String]` - generate an array consisting of each element of the input array prefixed; by a specified `String`.

NOTE: if upgrading from a hotfix version of Cromwell; that relied upon this cache, the cache is now opt-in and must be turned on explicitly in config.; - To maintain conformance with the OpenWDL spec, Cromwell drops support for the `version draft-3` identifier in this release. In the rare case where end users may have been using `version draft-3`, `version 1.0` is a drop-in replacement with no effect on functionality. ### HTTP Workflow Inputs for Shared File System and Google Pipelines API Version 2 Backends. `http` and `https` workflow inputs are now supported for shared filesystem and Google Pipelines API (PAPI) version 2; backends. Configuration details are described [here](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/filesystems/HTTP). ### Call cache hint support. More efficient cache hit copying in multi-user environments is now supported through the `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` workflow option.; Details [here](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/CallCaching/#call-cache-hit-path-prefixes). ### Root workflow level file hash caching support. Cromwell now offers the ability to cache file hashes on a root workflow level basis, details [here](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/CallCaching/#file-hash-caching). ### Extra configuration options. The value `dockerRoot` can now be set in a backend configuration.; This will set the execution folder in the container (default: `/cromwell-executions`). ### Bug Fixes. #### API; - The `releaseHold` endpoint will now return `404 Not Found` for an unrecognized workflow ID and `400 Bad Request` for a malformed or invalid workflow ID. #### Languages. - Fixed a bug that allowed values to be ""auto-boxed"" into a single-element `Array` of that type, which is not allowed in the WDL spec (Closes [#3478](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/3478)). #### PAPI ve",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:65378,cache,cache,65378,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['cache'],['cache']

Performance,"is the ARN for the job Queue""?. A good example of the difference can be seen in the 'disks' configuration. In; Pipelines, you need to specify the type of disk and size. In AWS, this will; be defined instead when you setup your environment (more on that later), so; all the AWS backend really needs to know is what mount points you need; defined. This infrastructure and all the associated configuration still exists; however,; it is moved out of the Cromwell configuration. AWS Batch; ---------. Because AWS Batch is so different from PAPI, those familiar only with PAPI; would be best off with an overview of AWS Batch. If you are familiar with; the workings of Batch, feel free to skip this section, and move on. [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) fundamentally is a service to allow batch jobs to run easily and; efficiently. To use it effectively, however, you need to understand its own; technical stack. To create a job, you need a ""Job Queue"". That job queue allows; jobs to be scheduled onto one or more ""Compute Environments"". This can; be managed through AWS Batch, but when AWS Batch sets up a compute environment,; it's simply setting up an Elastic Container Service (ECS) Cluster. The ECS; cluster, in turn is just a few managed CloudFormation templates, that is; controlling an AutoScaling group of EC2 instances. What really makes an ECS instance an ECS instance is the presence of a configured; [Amazon ECS agent](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent). This agent polls; the ECS service to determine if there are any tasks to run. An AWS Batch Job; will be turned into an ECS task. From there, the agent will pick it up and; manage it, sending updates back to ECS (and from there AWS Batch) on a regular; basis. There are some limits that will impact the design of the AWS Batch backend, and; will be discussed later. These are:. * [AWS Batch Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/service_limits.html); * [8k container overrides limit.](https://docs.aws",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/supportedBackends/aws/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/impl/aws/README.md:1953,queue,queue,1953,supportedBackends/aws/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/impl/aws/README.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/supportedBackends/aws/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/impl/aws/README.md,2,['queue'],['queue']

This is the `<call_dir>`.; Any input files to a call need to be localized into the `<call_dir>/inputs` directory. There are different localization strategies that Cromwell will try until one works:. * `hard-link` - This will create a hard link to the file; * `soft-link` - Create a symbolic link to the file.

This copies files to a file cache in ; `<workflow_root>/cached-inputs` and then hard links them in the `<call_dir>/inputs` directory. . `cached-copy` is intended for a shared filesystem that runs on multiple physical disks, where docker containers are used. ; Hard-links don't work between different physical disks and soft-links don't work with docker by default. Copying uses a lot of; space if a multitude of tasks use the same input. `cached-copy` copies the file only once to the physical disk containing; the `<workflow_root>` and then uses hard links for every task that needs the input file.

This feature; is turned off by default but can be enabled backend-wide by specifying a `gsutil`-compatible memory specification for the key; `batch.parallel-composite-upload-threshold` in backend configuration. This memory value represents the minimum size an output file; must have to be a candidate for `gsutil` parallel composite uploading:. ```; backend {; ...; providers {; ...; GCPBATCH {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.google.batch.GcpBatchLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; ...; batch {; ...; parallel-composite-upload-threshold = 150M; ...; }; ...; }; }; }; }; ```. Alternatively this threshold can be specified in workflow options using the key `parallel-composite-upload-threshold`,; which takes precedence over a setting in configuration. The default setting for this threshold is `0` which turns off; parallel composite uploads; a value of `0` can also be used in workflow options to turn off parallel composite uploads; in ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/GCPBatch.md:15648,perform,performance,15648,docs/backends/GCPBatch.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/GCPBatch.md,1,['perform'],['performance']

Womtool previously supported a `womtool upgrade` command for upgrading draft-2 WDLs to 1.0. With WDL 1.1 soon to ; become the latest supported version, this functionality is retiring. ([#7382](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7382)). ### Replacement of `gsutil` with `gcloud storage`. In this release ([#7359](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7359)), all **localization** functionality on the GCP backend migrates to use the more modern and performant `gcloud storage`. With sufficiently powerful worker VMs, Cromwell can now localize at up to 1200 MB/s [0][1][2]. In a future release, **delocalization** will also migrate to `gcloud storage`. As part of that upcoming change, we are considering turning on [parallel composite uploads](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/Google/#parallel-composite-uploads) by default to maximize performance.

Performance,"large number of default options useful for getting started. For example, by default Cromwell doesn't require an external database while running all workflow jobs on your local machine. Soon you may want to start storing the results of your Cromwell runs in an external MySQL database. Or, you may want to run jobs on your organizations compute farm, or even run jobs in the cloud via the Pipelines API. All of these changes to the defaults will be done by setting configuration values. When you have many configuration settings you would like to set, you specify them in a custom configuration file. See the [configuration](../Configuring) page for more specific information on the configuration file, and for links to the example configuration file. #### Configuration file syntax. Cromwell configuration files are written in a syntax called HOCON. See the [HOCON documentation](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#hocon-human-optimized-config-object-notation) for more information on all the ways one can create a valid configuration file. #### Creating your first configuration file. To get started customizing Cromwell via a configuration file, create a new empty text file, say `your.conf`. Then add this include at the top:. ```hocon; include required(classpath(""application"")); ```. The default Cromwell configuration values are set via Cromwell's `application.conf`. To ensure that you always have the defaults from the `application.conf`, you must include it at the top of your new configuration file. #### Running Cromwell with your configuration file. Once you have created a new configuration file, you can pass the path to Cromwell by setting the system property `config.file`:. ```bash; java -Dconfig.file=/path/to/your.conf -jar cromwell-[VERSION].jar server; ```. Cromwell should start up as normal. As you haven't actually overridden any values yet, Cromwell should be running with the same settings. #### Setting a configuration value.

Performance,"led outside. All the AWS Batch; backend needs to know is ""what is the ARN for the job Queue""?. A good example of the difference can be seen in the 'disks' configuration. In; Pipelines, you need to specify the type of disk and size. In AWS, this will; be defined instead when you setup your environment (more on that later), so; all the AWS backend really needs to know is what mount points you need; defined. This infrastructure and all the associated configuration still exists; however,; it is moved out of the Cromwell configuration. AWS Batch; ---------. Because AWS Batch is so different from PAPI, those familiar only with PAPI; would be best off with an overview of AWS Batch. If you are familiar with; the workings of Batch, feel free to skip this section, and move on. [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) fundamentally is a service to allow batch jobs to run easily and; efficiently. To use it effectively, however, you need to understand its own; technical stack. To create a job, you need a ""Job Queue"". That job queue allows; jobs to be scheduled onto one or more ""Compute Environments"". This can; be managed through AWS Batch, but when AWS Batch sets up a compute environment,; it's simply setting up an Elastic Container Service (ECS) Cluster. The ECS; cluster, in turn is just a few managed CloudFormation templates, that is; controlling an AutoScaling group of EC2 instances. What really makes an ECS instance an ECS instance is the presence of a configured; [Amazon ECS agent](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent). This agent polls; the ECS service to determine if there are any tasks to run. An AWS Batch Job; will be turned into an ECS task. From there, the agent will pick it up and; manage it, sending updates back to ECS (and from there AWS Batch) on a regular; basis. There are some limits that will impact the design of the AWS Batch backend, and; will be discussed later. These are:. * [AWS Batch Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/service_l",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/supportedBackends/aws/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/impl/aws/README.md:1936,Queue,Queue,1936,supportedBackends/aws/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/impl/aws/README.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/supportedBackends/aws/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/impl/aws/README.md,1,['Queue'],['Queue']
Performance,"listing.groupings.workflow-option` and a workflow option is specified; having a matching key, all workflows specifying the same value will share a blacklist cache. . For example, if Cromwell configuration contains `call-caching.blacklisting.groupings.workflow-option = ""project""` and; a workflow is submitted with the options. ```json; {; ""project"": ""Mary""; }; ```. then this workflow will share a blacklist cache with any other workflows whose workflow options contain `""project"": ""Mary""`. Grouping of blacklist caches can significantly improve blacklisting effectiveness and overall call caching performance.; Workflows should be grouped by their effective authorization to ensure the same filesystem/object store permissions; exist for every workflow in the group. **** Hit blacklisting ****. If a cache hit fails copying for any reason, Cromwell will record that failure in the blacklist cache and will not use; the hit again. Hit blacklisting is particularly effective at improving call caching performance in conjunction with the ; grouping feature described above. **** Path prefix (GCS bucket) blacklisting on 403 Forbidden errors ****. In a multi-user environment user A might cache hit to one of user B's results; but that doesn't necessarily mean user A is authorized to read user B's outputs from the filesystem. Call cache blacklisting; allows Cromwell to record which file path prefixes were involved in cache result copy authorization failures.; If Cromwell sees that the file paths for a candidate cache hit have a blacklisted prefix, Cromwell will quickly ; fail the copy attempt without doing any potentially expensive I/O. Path prefix blacklisting could be supported by any backend type though it is currently implemented only for Google; (PAPI) backends. For Google backends the GCS bucket is considered the prefix for blacklisting purposes. ***Call cache whitelisting***; ; In a multi-user environment where access to job outputs may be restricted among different users, it can be",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md:5124,perform,performance,5124,docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,1,['perform'],['performance']

Previous versions of Cromwell incorporated the name of the backend on which a call was run into the call cache hashes generated for that call.; Unfortunately this made it impossible to change the name of a backend without losing all previously run calls as potential cache hits.; Cromwell 37 introduces the `name-for-call-caching-purposes` backend configuration option as a means of decoupling the backend name from the; value used for the backend name for call caching purposes. ### CWL. Support `InputResourceRequirement` hint. ### Changing configuration options. #### Logging Token Distribution. In cases where its not obvious why jobs are queued in Cromwell, you can enable logging for the Job Execution Token Dispenser, using; the `system.hog-safety.token-log-interval-seconds` configuration value. The default, `0`, means that no logging will occur. #### HTTP Filesystem. - The HTTP filesystem is now enabled for engine use by default. To continue without an HTTP filesystem, you can add the; following content into the appropriate stanza of your configuration file:; ```; engine {; filesystems {; http {; enabled: false; }; }; }; ```; - When the value `exit-code-timeout-seconds` is set, `check-alive` command is now only called once every timeout interval instead of each poll. ### Beta preview of new Womtool `/describe` endpoint.

A placeholder file will be placed in the execution folder of the cached call to explain the absence of output files and point to the location of the original ones. ### Metadata Write Batching. Metadata write batching works the same as in previous versions of Cromwell, but the default batch size has been changed from 1 to 200. It's possible that 200 is too high in some environments, but 200 is more likely to be an appropriate value; than the previous default. ## 27. ### Migration. * Call Caching has been improved in this version of Cromwell, specifically the time needed to determine whether or not a job can be cached; has drastically decreased. To achieve that the database schema has been modified and a migration is required in order to preserve the pre-existing cached jobs.; This migration is relatively fast compared to previous migrations. To get an idea of the time needed, look at the size of your `CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY` table.; As a benchmark, it takes 1 minute for a table with 6 million rows.; The migration will only be executed on MySQL. Other databases will lose their previous cached jobs.; In order to run properly on MySQL, **the following flag needs to be adjusted**: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_group_concat_max_len; The following query will give you a minimum to set the group_concat_max_len value to:. ```sql; SELECT MAX(aggregated) as group_concat_max_len FROM; (; SELECT cche.CALL_CACHING_ENTRY_ID, SUM(LENGTH(CONCAT(cche.HASH_KEY, cche.HASH_VALUE))) AS aggregated; FROM CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY cche; GROUP BY cche.CALL_CACHING_ENTRY_ID; ) aggregation; ```.

[udocker](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker) is a tool designed to ""execute simple docker containers in user space without requiring root privileges"". In essence, udocker provides a command line interface that mimics `docker`, and implements the commands using one of four different container backends:. * PRoot; * Fakechroot; * runC; * Singularity. #### Installation; udocker can be installed without any kind of root permissions. Refer to udocker's installation documentation [here](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/blob/master/doc/installation_manual.md) for more information. #### Configuration. (As of [2019-02-18](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/issues/112)) udocker does not support looking up docker container by digests, hence you'll have to make ensure `hash-lookup` is disabled.

Performance,"mits. For example the Pipelines API imposes a quota on the number of queries that can be made per second. You can effectively control and throttle the number of requests and resources allocated to those operations in the `system.io` configuration:. ```; system.io {; number-of-requests = 100000; per = 100 seconds; }; ```. **I/O Resilience**. I/O operations can fail for a number of reason from network failures to server errors. Some of those errors are not fatal and can be retried. Cromwell will retry I/O operations on such retryable errors, for a limited number of times before giving up and failing. This number (more precisely the number of attempts that will be made) can be set using the following configuration option:. ```; system.io {; number-of-attempts = 5; }; ```. ### Workflows. **Max Concurrent Workflows**. Cromwell has a configurable cap on the number of workflows running at a time. You can adjust the limit from the default `5000` by setting:. ```hocon; system.max-concurrent-workflows = 5000; ```. **New Workflow Poll Rate**. Cromwell will look for new workflows to start on a regular interval, configured as a number of seconds. You can change the polling rate from the default `20` seconds by editing the value:. ```hocon; system.new-workflow-poll-rate = 20; ```. **Max Workflow Launch Count**. On every poll, Cromwell will take at limited number of new submissions, provided there are new workflows to launch and the `system.max-concurrent-workflows` number has not been reached. While the default is to launch up to `1` workflow, you can override this by setting:. ```hocon; system.max-workflow-launch-count = 1; ```. ***Abort configuration***. Cromwell will scan for abort requests using default configuration values equivalent to those below. In most circumstances; there shouldn't be a need to override these defaults. ```hocon; system {; abort {; # How frequently Cromwell should scan for aborts.; scan-frequency: 30 seconds. # The cache of in-progress aborts.

It happens because containers are launched without specific linux capabilities being enabled. ; Google pipelines backend supports running containers with the enabled capabilities and so does Cromwell. . If you need to use fuses within task containers then you can set `enable_fuse` workflow option. . ```; {; ""enable_fuse"": true; }; ```. Differently you can enable support for fuses right in your backend configuration. ```; backend.providers.Papiv2.config {; genomics {; enable-fuse = true; }; }; ```. There is a list of limitations regarding the usage of FUSE filesystems:. + Any inputs brought in via a FUSE filesystem will not be considered for call caching.; + Any outputs stored via a FUSE filesystem will not be recreated if a task is replayed from a call-cache hit.; + If the filesystem is writable, your job is potentially no longer idempotent - Cromwell may decide to retry your job for you, and you might get unforeseen file collisions or even incorrect results if that happens. #### Google Labels. Every call run on the Pipelines API backend is given certain labels by default, so that Google resources can be queried by these labels later. ; The current default label set automatically applied is:. | Key | Value | Example | Notes |; |-----|-------|---------|-------|; | cromwell-workflow-id | The Cromwell ID given to the root workflow (i.e. the ID returned by Cromwell on submission) | cromwell-d4b412c5-bf3d-4169-91b0-1b635ce47a26 | To fit the required [format](#label-format), we prefix with 'cromwell-' |; | cromwell-sub-workflow-name | The name of this job's sub-workflow | my-sub-workflow | Only present if the task is called in a subworkflow. |; | wdl-task-name | The name of the WDL task | my-tas",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/Google.md:12659,cache,cache,12659,docs/backends/Google.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/Google.md,1,['cache'],['cache']

NOTE: if upgrading from a hotfix version of Cromwell; that relied upon this cache, the cache is now opt-in and must be turned on explicitly in config.; - To maintain conformance with the OpenWDL spec, Cromwell drops support for the `version draft-3` identifier in this release. In the rare case where end users may have been using `version draft-3`, `version 1.0` is a drop-in replacement with no effect on functionality. ### HTTP Workflow Inputs for Shared File System and Google Pipelines API Version 2 Backends. `http` and `https` workflow inputs are now supported for shared filesystem and Google Pipelines API (PAPI) version 2; backends. Configuration details are described [here](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/filesystems/HTTP). ### Call cache hint support. More efficient cache hit copying in multi-user environments is now supported through the `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` workflow option.; Details [here](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/CallCaching/#call-cache-hit-path-prefixes). ### Root workflow level file hash caching support. Cromwell now offers the ability to cache file hashes on a root workflow level basis, details [here](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/CallCaching/#file-hash-caching). ### Extra configuration options. The value `dockerRoot` can now be set in a backend configuration.; This will set the execution folder in the container (default: `/cromwell-executions`). ### Bug Fixes. #### API; - The `releaseHold` endpoint will now return `404 Not Found` for an unrecognized workflow ID and `400 Bad Request` for a malformed or invalid workflow ID. #### Languages. - Fixed a bug that allowed values to be ""auto-boxed"" into a single-element `Array` of that type, which is not allowed in the WDL spec (Closes [#3478](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/3478)). #### PAPI version 1. - Restored standard output and error streaming for jobs. ## 34 Release Notes. ### Query API. * Fixes a bug which stopped `includeSubw",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:65576,cache,cache-hit-path-prefixes,65576,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['cache'],['cache-hit-path-prefixes']
Performance,"n, `user_service_account_json` is expected to be a literal escaped Google service account auth JSON.; See the `User Service Account` section above for more information on using user service accounts.; If the key, token or auth value is provided in workflow options then the corresponding private Docker configuration value; is not required, and vice versa. Also note that for the `user_service_account_json` workflow option to work an auth of type `user_service_account`; must be defined in Cromwell's `google.auths` stanza; more details in the `User Service Account` section above. Example PAPI v2 workflow options for private Docker configuration:. ```; {; ""docker_credentials_key_name"": ""name/of/the/kms/key/used/for/encrypting/and/decrypting/the/docker/hub/token"",; ""docker_credentials_token"": ""base64_username:password"",; ""user_service_account_json"": ""<properly escaped user service account JSON file>""; }; ```. Important. If any of the three private Docker configuration values of key name, auth, or Docker token are missing, PAPI v2 will not perform a `docker login`.; If the Docker image to be pulled is not public the `docker pull` will fail which will cause the overall job to fail. If using any of these private Docker workflow options it is advisable to add; them to the `workflow-options.encrypted-fields` list in Cromwell configuration. **Monitoring**. In order to monitor metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk usage...) about the VM during Call Runtime, a workflow option can be used to specify the path to a script that will run in the background and write its output to a log file. ```; {; ""monitoring_script"": ""gs://cromwell/monitoring/script.sh""; }; ```. The output of this script will be written to a `monitoring.log` file that will be available in the call gcs bucket when the call completes. This feature is meant to run a script in the background during long-running processes.

Cromwell tracks the execution of workflows and stores outputs of task invocations in a SQL database. Cromwell supports either an external MySQL database, or a temporary in-memory database. By default, Cromwell uses an in-memory database which will only live for the duration of the JVM. This provides a quick way to run workflows locally without having to set up MySQL, though it also makes workflow executions somewhat transient.

For more information see; [create_images.sh](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/develop/scripts/reference_disks/create_images.sh). ### Docker Image Cache Support. To optimize job execution time, Cromwell 55 and later support the use of Docker image caches on the PAPI v2 lifesciences beta backend. Docker image caches are not available on the PAPI v2 genomics alpha backend.; Configuration looks like:. ```hocon; backend {; ...; providers {; ...; PapiV2 {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.google.pipelines.v2beta.PipelinesApiLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; ...; docker-image-cache-manifest-file = ""gs://path/to/a/docker/image/cache/manifest.json""; ...; }; }; }; }; ```.

Doing so might cause cache hits in Cromwell to copy over modified data and Cromwell currently does not check that the contents of the output directory changed. Additionally, if any files from a previous job directory are removed, call caching will fail due to missing files. ***File hash caching***. Cromwell offers the option to cache file hashes within the scope of a root workflow to prevent repeatedly requesting the hashes of the; same files multiple times. File hash caching is off by default and can be turned on with the configuration option `system.file-hash-cache=true`. ***Call cache blacklisting***; Cromwell offers the ability to filter cache hits based on copying failures. . Call cache blacklisting configuration looks like:. ```; call-caching {. enabled = true. # In a multi-user environment this should be false so unauthorized users don't invalidate results for authorized users. ; invalidate-bad-cache-results = false. blacklist-cache {; # The call caching blacklist cache is off by default.

For multi-instance Cromwell deployments sharing a single database, earlier versions of Cromwell required abort; requests to be sent specifically to the instance that was running the targeted workflow. Cromwell 37 now; allows abort commands to be sent to any Cromwell instance in the shared-database deployment. Configuration details; [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/Configuring/abort-configuration). ### Call cache blacklisting. The Google Pipelines API (PAPI) version 1 and 2 backends now offer the option of call cache blacklisting on a per-bucket basis.; More info [here](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/CallCaching/#call-cache-copy-authorization-failure-prefix-blacklisting). ### WDL. - All memory units in WDL are now treated as base-2.; For instance `1 KB == 1 KiB == 1024 Bytes`. ### Backend name for call caching purposes. Previous versions of Cromwell incorporated the name of the backend on which a call was run into the call cache hashes generated for that call.; Unfortunately this made it impossible to change the name of a backend without losing all previously run calls as potential cache hits.; Cromwell 37 introduces the `name-for-call-caching-purposes` backend configuration option as a means of decoupling the backend name from the; value used for the backend name for call caching purposes. ### CWL. Support `InputResourceRequirement` hint. ### Changing configuration options. #### Logging Token Distribution. In cases where its not obvious why jobs are queued in Cromwell, you can enable logging for the Job Execution Token Dispenser, using; the `system.hog-safety.token-log-interval-seconds` configuration value. The default, `0`, means that no logging will occur. #### HTTP Filesystem. - The HTTP filesystem is now enabled for engine use by default.

Performance,"nd.providers.SGE.config {; job-id-regex = ""(\\d+)""; }; ```. #### How Cromwell should abort an HPC job. When aborting an HPC job, Cromwell will run a command confifured under the key `kill`, passing in the WDL variable `job_id`:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; kill = ""qdel ${job_id}""; }; ```. #### How Cromwell checks if an HPC job is alive. Whenever Cromwell restarts it checks to see if a job has completed by searching for return code in a file called `rc`. If this file isn't available, in this case Cromwell runs an extra check to make sure the job is still alive. You can configure the command used for this check via:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; check-alive = ""qstat -j ${job_id}""; }; ```. #### Other backend settings. On some systems, the administrators may limit the number of HPC jobs a user may run at a time. To configure this limit, you can use the value `concurrent-job-limit` to limit the number of jobs. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; concurrent-job-limit = 100; }; ```. #### Putting the config section all together. With the above sections, we can combine them all together to create a completly working HPC backend. ```hocon; backend {; default = SGE; ; providers {; SGE {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; concurrent-job-limit = 100; ; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int cpu = 1; Float? memory_gb; String? sge_queue; String? sge_project; """"""; ; submit = """"""; qsub \; -terse \; -V \; -b y \; -N ${job_name} \; -wd ${cwd} \; -o ${out} \; -e ${err} \; -pe smp ${cpu} \; ${""-l mem_free="" + memory_gb + ""g""} \; ${""-q "" + sge_queue} \; ${""-P "" + sge_project} \; /usr/bin/env bash ${script}; """""". job-id-regex = ""(\\d+)"". kill = ""qdel ${job_id}""; check-alive = ""qstat -j ${job_id}""; }; }; }; }; ```.

In some cases PAPI v2 will report the preemption of a VM in a way that differs from PAPI v1. This novel means of reporting; preemption was not recognized by Cromwell's PAPI v2 backend and would result in preemptions being miscategorized as call failures.; Cromwell's PAPI v2 backend will now handle this type of preemption. ## 43 Release Notes. ### Virtual Private Cloud with Subnetworks.

Example `options.json`:; ```json; {; ""write_to_cache"": true,; ""read_from_cache"": true; }; ```. ## Retry with More Memory Multiplier. The `memory_retry_multiplier` workflow option sets the factor by which the memory should be multiplied while retrying ; when Cromwell encounters one of the error keys (specified in Cromwell config using `system.memory-retry-error-keys`) in ; the `stderr` file. The factor should be in the range `1.0 ≤ multipler ≤ 99.0` (note: if set to `1.0` the task will retry ; with same amount of memory).

HPC backends are put under the same umbrella because they all use the same generic configuration that can be specialized to fit the need of a particular technology. Backends are specified in the `backend.providers` configuration. Each backend has a configuration that looks like:. ```hocon; BackendName {; actor-factory = ""FQN of BackendLifecycleActorFactory class""; config {; ...; }; }; ```. The structure within the `config` block will vary from one backend to another; it is the backend implementation's responsibility; to be able to interpret its configuration. The providers section can contain multiple backends which will all be available to Cromwell. ## Backend Job Limits. All backends support limiting the number of concurrent jobs by specifying the following option in the backend's configuration; stanza:. ```; backend {; ...; providers {; BackendName {; actor-factory = ...; config {; concurrent-job-limit = 5; ```. ## Backend Filesystems. Each backend will utilize a filesystem to store the directory structure and results of an executed workflow.; The backend/filesystem pairings are as follows:. * Local and HPC backend use the [Shared Local Filesystem](HPC/#filesystems).; * Google backend uses the [Google Cloud Storage Filesystem](Google/#google-cloud-storage-filesystem).

More details [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/backends/Google#docker-image-cache-support). #### Preemptible Recovery via Checkpointing. * Cromwell can now help tasks recover from preemption by allowing them to specify a 'checkpoint' file which will be restored; to the worker VM on the next attempt if the task is interrupted. More details [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/optimizations/CheckpointFiles). ## 54 Release Notes. ### Bug Fixes. * Fixed a bug that prevented `write_json()` from working with arrays and primitives. The function now works as expected for `Boolean`, `String`, `Integer`, `Float`,; `Pair[_, _]`, `Object`, `Map[_, _]` and `Array[_]` (including array of objects) type inputs.

Performance,"nly needs the output of hello in the hello_and_goodbye sub-workflow. ; If hello_and_goodbye fails, then `myTask` won't be executed.; Only workflow outputs are visible outside a workflow, which means that references to outputs produced by a sub-workflow will only be valid if those outputs are exposed in the workflow output section. Sub-workflows are executed in the context of a main workflow, which means that operations that are normally executed once per workflow (set up, clean up, outputs copying, log copying, etc...); will NOT be re-executed for each sub-workflow. For instance if a resource is created during workflow initialization, sub-workflows will need to share this same resource.; Workflow outputs will be copied for the main root workflow but not for intermediate sub-workflows. Restarts, aborts, and call-caching work exactly as they would with tasks. ; All tasks run by a sub-workflow are eligible for call caching under the same rules as any other task.; However, workflows themselves are not cached as such. Which means that running the exact same workflow twice with call caching on will trigger each task to cache individually,; but not the workflow itself. The root path for sub-workflow execution files (scripts, output files, logs) will be under the parent workflow call directory.; For example, the execution directory for the above main workflow would look like the following:. ```; cromwell-executions/main_workflow/1d919bd4-d046-43b0-9918-9964509689dd/ <- main workflow id; └── call-hello_and_goodbye <- call directory for call hello_and_goodbye in the main workflow; └── hello_and_goodbye <- name of the sub-workflow ; └── a6365f91-c807-465a-9186-a5d3da98fe11 <- sub-workflow id; ├── call-goodbye; │ └── execution; │ ├── rc; │ ├── script; │ ├── script.background; │ ├── script.submit; │ ├── stderr; │ ├── stderr.background; │ ├── stdout; │ └── stdout.background; └── call-hello; └── execution; ├── rc; ├── script; ├── script.background; ├── script.submit; ├── stderr; ├─",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/SubWorkflows.md:3036,cache,cached,3036,docs/SubWorkflows.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/SubWorkflows.md,1,['cache'],['cached']

Performance,"o specify the desired behavior of Cromwell regarding call outputs when a call finds a hit in the cache.; The default value is `copy` which will copy all output files to the new call directory.; A second value is allowed, `reference`, that will instead point to the original output files, without copying them. ```hocon; filesystems {; gcs {; auth = ""application-default"". caching {; duplication-strategy = ""reference""; }; }; }; ```. A placeholder file will be placed in the execution folder of the cached call to explain the absence of output files and point to the location of the original ones. ### Metadata Write Batching. Metadata write batching works the same as in previous versions of Cromwell, but the default batch size has been changed from 1 to 200. It's possible that 200 is too high in some environments, but 200 is more likely to be an appropriate value; than the previous default. ## 27. ### Migration. * Call Caching has been improved in this version of Cromwell, specifically the time needed to determine whether or not a job can be cached; has drastically decreased. To achieve that the database schema has been modified and a migration is required in order to preserve the pre-existing cached jobs.; This migration is relatively fast compared to previous migrations. To get an idea of the time needed, look at the size of your `CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY` table.; As a benchmark, it takes 1 minute for a table with 6 million rows.; The migration will only be executed on MySQL. Other databases will lose their previous cached jobs.; In order to run properly on MySQL, **the following flag needs to be adjusted**: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_group_concat_max_len; The following query will give you a minimum to set the group_concat_max_len value to:. ```sql; SELECT MAX(aggregated) as group_concat_max_len FROM; (; SELECT cche.CALL_CACHING_ENTRY_ID, SUM(LENGTH(CONCAT(cche.HASH_KEY, cche.HASH_VALUE))) AS aggregated; FROM CALL_CACHING_HAS",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:88610,cache,cached,88610,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['cache'],['cached']

To run Singularity on a job scheduler, the singularity command needs to be passed to the scheduler as a wrapped command. For example, in SLURM, we can use the normal SLURM configuration as explained in the [SLURM documentation](../backends/SLURM), however we'll add a `submit-docker` block to execute when a task is tagged with a docker container. . When constructing this block, there are a few things to keep in mind:; - Make sure Singularity is loaded (and in PATH). If `module` is installed for ; example you can call `module load Singularity`. If the cluster admin has made; a Singularity module available. Alternatively you can alter the `PATH` ; variable directly or simply use `/path/to/singularity` ; directly in the config.; - We should treat worker nodes as if they do not have stable access to the ; internet or build access, so we will pull the container before the task is ; submit to the cluster.; - It's a good idea to use a Singularity cache so that same images should only; have to be pulled once. Make sure you set the `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` ; environment variable to a location on the filesystem that is reachable by the; worker nodes!; - If we are using a cache we need to ensure that submit processes started by; Cromwell do not pull to the same cache at the same time. This may corrupt the; cache. We can prevent this by implementing a filelock with `flock` and ; pulling the image before the job is submitted. The flock and pull command ; needs to be placed *before* the submit command",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md:8935,load,load,8935,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md,2,['load'],['load']

By default Cromwell's blacklist caches work at the granularity of root workflows, but Cromwell can also be configured to; share a blacklist cache among a group of workflows. ; If a value is specified for `call-caching.blacklisting.groupings.workflow-option` and a workflow option is specified; having a matching key, all workflows specifying the same value will share a blacklist cache. . For example, if Cromwell configuration contains `call-caching.blacklisting.groupings.workflow-option = ""project""` and; a workflow is submitted with the options. ```json; {; ""project"": ""Mary""; }; ```. then this workflow will share a blacklist cache with any other workflows whose workflow options contain `""project"": ""Mary""`. Grouping of blacklist caches can significantly improve blacklisting effectiveness and overall call caching performance.; Workflows should be grouped by their effective authorization to ensure the same filesystem/object store permissions; exist for every workflow in the group. **** Hit blacklisting ****. If a cache hit fails copying for any reason, Cromwell will record that failure in the blacklist cache and will not use; the hit again. Hit blacklisting is particularly effective at improving call caching performance in conjunction with the ; grouping feature described above. **** Path prefix (GCS bucket) blacklisting on 403 Forbidden errors ****. In a multi-user environment user A might cache hit to one of user B's results; but that doesn't necessarily mean user A is authorized to read user B's outputs from the filesystem.

Performance,"oks like the one above, and one of the labels in your project is. ```; ""my-private-network"" = ""vpc-network""; ```. Cromwell will get labels from the project's metadata and look for a label whose key is `my-private-network`.; Then it will use the value of the label, which is `vpc-network` here, as the name of private network and run the jobs on this network.; If the network key is not present in the project's metadata Cromwell will fall back to trying to run jobs using literal; network labels, and then fall back to running on the default network. ### Custom Google Cloud SDK container; Cromwell can't use Google's container registry if VPC Perimeter is used in project.; Own repository can be used by adding `cloud-sdk-image-url` reference to used container:. ```; google {; ...; cloud-sdk-image-url = ""eu.gcr.io/your-project-id/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk:354.0.0-alpine""; cloud-sdk-image-size-gb = 1; }; ```. ### Parallel Composite Uploads. Cromwell can be configured to use GCS parallel composite uploads which can greatly improve delocalization performance. This feature; is turned off by default but can be enabled backend-wide by specifying a `gsutil`-compatible memory specification for the key; `genomics.parallel-composite-upload-threshold` in backend configuration. This memory value represents the minimum size an output file; must have to be a candidate for `gsutil` parallel composite uploading:. ```; backend {; ...; providers {; ...; PapiV2 {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.google.pipelines.v2beta.PipelinesApiLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; ...; genomics {; ...; parallel-composite-upload-threshold = 150M; ...; }; ...; }; }; }; }; ```. Alternatively this threshold can be specified in workflow options using the key `parallel-composite-upload-threshold`,; which takes precedence over a setting in configuration. The default setting for this threshold is `0` which turns off; parallel composite uploads; a value of `0` can also be used in workflow options to turn off parallel com",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/Google.md:18921,perform,performance,18921,docs/backends/Google.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/Google.md,1,['perform'],['performance']
Performance,"oll-rate = 20; ```. **Max Workflow Launch Count**. On every poll, Cromwell will take at limited number of new submissions, provided there are new workflows to launch and the `system.max-concurrent-workflows` number has not been reached. While the default is to launch up to `1` workflow, you can override this by setting:. ```hocon; system.max-workflow-launch-count = 1; ```. ***Abort configuration***. Cromwell will scan for abort requests using default configuration values equivalent to those below. In most circumstances; there shouldn't be a need to override these defaults. ```hocon; system {; abort {; # How frequently Cromwell should scan for aborts.; scan-frequency: 30 seconds. # The cache of in-progress aborts. Cromwell will add entries to this cache once a WorkflowActor has been messaged to abort.; # If on the next scan an 'Aborting' status is found for a workflow that has an entry in this cache, Cromwell will not ask; # the associated WorkflowActor to abort again.; cache {; # Guava cache concurrency.; concurrency: 1; # How long entries in the cache should live from the time they are added to the cache.; ttl: 20 minutes; # Maximum number of entries in the cache.; size: 100000; }; }; }; ```. ### Database. **Using a MySQL Database**. Cromwell tracks the execution of workflows and stores outputs of task invocations in a SQL database. Cromwell supports either an external MySQL database, or a temporary in-memory database. By default, Cromwell uses an in-memory database which will only live for the duration of the JVM. This provides a quick way to run workflows locally without having to set up MySQL, though it also makes workflow executions somewhat transient. To configure Cromwell to instead point to a MySQL database, first create the empty database. In the example below, the database name is `cromwell`. Then, edit your configuration file `database` stanza, as follows:. ```hocon; database {; profile = ""slick.jdbc.MySQLProfile$""; db {; driver = ""com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md:5275,cache,cache,5275,docs/Configuring.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md,3,"['cache', 'concurren']","['cache', 'concurrency']"

Performance,"on the PAPI backend, Cromwell will automatically prepend ""this"" bucket to the call cache hit path prefixes to search.; For example, if Charles specified the same workflow options as in the example above and his workflow root was under `gs://charles_bucket`,; Cromwell would search cache hits in all of the `gs://alice_bucket`, `gs://bob_bucket` and `gs://charles_bucket` buckets without having to specify; `gs://charles_bucket` bucket explicitly in `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes`. If no `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` are specified then all matching cache hits will be considered. ***Call cache failure logging***. When Cromwell fails to cache a job from a previous result the reason will be logged. To reduce the verbosity of the logs; only the first three failure reasons will be logged per shard of each job. Cromwell will continue to try copying; previous results for the call, and when no candidates are left Cromwell will run the job on the backend. **Docker Tags**. Certain Docker tags can impact call caching performance. ; Docker tags are a convenient way to point to a version of an image (`ubuntu:14.04`), or even the latest version (`ubuntu:latest`).; For that purpose, tags are mutable, meaning that the image they point to can change, while the tag name stays the same.; While this is very convenient in some cases, using mutable, or ""floating"" tags in tasks affects the reproducibility of a workflow. ; If you were to run the same workflow using `ubuntu:latest` now, and again in a year (or even in a month) may run with different docker images.; This has an even bigger impact when Call Caching is turned on in Cromwell, and could lead to unpredictable behaviors if a tag is updated in the middle of a workflow or even a scatter for example. In order to ensure perfect reproducibility, Docker provides another way of identifying an image version by using the specific digest of the image, which is an immutable identifier. The digest is guaranteed to be different if 2 images have diff",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md:8256,perform,performance,8256,docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,1,['perform'],['performance']
Performance,"onfiguration:. ```; call-caching {; enabled = true; invalidate-bad-cache-results = true; }; ```. When `call-caching.enabled=true` (default: `false`), Cromwell will be able to to reference or copy results from previously run jobs (when appropriate).; When `invalidate-bad-cache-results=true` (default: `true`), Cromwell will invalidate any cache results which contain files that cannot be accessed within a cache-hit. This is usually desired, but might be unwanted if this failure occurs for external reasons, such as a difference in user authentication. Cromwell also accepts [Workflow Options](wf_options/Overview#call-caching-options) to override the cache read/write behavior. . ### Local filesystem options. When running a job on the Config (Shared Filesystem) backend, Cromwell provides some additional options in the backend's ; config section:. ```HOCON; config {; filesystems {; local {; # When localizing a file, what type of file duplication should occur. ; # possible values: ""hard-link"", ""soft-link"", ""copy"", ""cached-copy"".; # For more information check: https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/HPC/#shared-filesystem; localization: [; ""hard-link"", ""soft-link"", ""copy""; ]. caching {; # When copying a cached result, what type of file duplication should occur. ; # possible values: ""hard-link"", ""soft-link"", ""copy"", ""cached-copy"".; # For more information check: https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/HPC/#shared-filesystem; # Attempted in the order listed below:; duplication-strategy: [; ""hard-link"", ""soft-link"", ""copy""; ]. # Possible values: md5, xxh64, fingerprint, path, path+modtime; # For extended explanation check: https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Configuring/#call-caching; # ""md5"" will compute an md5 hash of the file content.; # ""xxh64"" will compute an xxh64 hash of the file content.

Performance,"or any previously run job. Doing so might cause cache hits in Cromwell to copy over modified data and Cromwell currently does not check that the contents of the output directory changed. Additionally, if any files from a previous job directory are removed, call caching will fail due to missing files. ***File hash caching***. Cromwell offers the option to cache file hashes within the scope of a root workflow to prevent repeatedly requesting the hashes of the; same files multiple times. File hash caching is off by default and can be turned on with the configuration option `system.file-hash-cache=true`. ***Call cache blacklisting***; Cromwell offers the ability to filter cache hits based on copying failures. .

For more information about this configuration or how to change the behaviour of AWS Batch, visit the [AWS Backend](/backends/AWSBatch) page. #### Workflow Source Files . Lastly, create an example workflow to run. We're going to define a simple workflow that will `echo` a string to the console and return the result to Cromwell. Within AWS Batch (like other cloud providers), we're required to specify a Docker container for every task. ##### `hello.wdl`. ```wdl; task hello {; String addressee = ""Cromwell""; command {; echo ""Hello ${addressee}! Welcome to Cromwell . . . on AWS!""; }; output {; String message = read_string(stdout()); }; runtime {; docker: ""ubuntu:latest""; }; }. workflow wf_hello {; call hello; output { hello.message }; }; ```. #### Running Cromwell and AWS . Provided all of the files are within the same directory, we can run our workflow with the following command:. > **Note**: You might have a different Cromwell version number here. ```bash; java -Dconfig.file=aws.conf -jar cromwell-36.jar run hello.wdl; ```. This will:; 1. Start Cromwell in `run` mode,; 2. Prepare `hello.wdl` as a job and submit this to your AWS Batch queue. You can monitor the job within your [AWS Batch dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/batch/home).; 3. Run the job, write execution files back to S3, and report progress back to Cromwell. #### Outputs. The end of your workflow logs should report the workflow outputs. ```; [info] SingleWorkflowRunnerActor workflow finished with status 'Succeeded'.; {; ""outputs"": {; ""wf_hello.hello.message"": ""Hello World! Welcome to Cromwell . . . on AWS!""; },; ""id"": ""08213b40-bcf5-470d-b8b7-1d1a9dccb10e""; }; ```. Success!. ### Next steps.

By default Cromwell's blacklist caches work at the granularity of root workflows, but Cromwell can also be configured to; share a blacklist cache among a group of workflows. ; If a value is specified for `call-caching.blacklisting.groupings.workflow-option` and a workflow option is specified; having a matching key, all workflows specifying the same value will share a blacklist cache. . For example, if Cromwell configuration contains `call-caching.blacklisting.groupings.workflow-option = ""project""` and; a workflow is submitted with the options. ```json; {; ""project"": ""Mary""; }; ```. then this workflow will share a blacklist cache with any other workflows whose workflow options contain `""project"": ""Mary""`. Grouping of blacklist caches can significantly improve blacklisting effectiveness and overall call caching performance.; Workflows should be grouped by their effective authorization to ensure the same filesystem/object store permissions; exist for every workflow in the group. **** Hit blacklisting ****.

Performance,"ounted. Putting this together, we have an example base configuration for a local environment:; ```hocon; include required(classpath(""application"")). backend {; default: singularity; providers: {; singularity {; # The backend custom configuration.; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory"". config {; run-in-background = true; runtime-attributes = """"""; String? docker; """"""; submit-docker = """"""; singularity exec --containall --bind ${cwd}:${docker_cwd} docker://${docker} ${job_shell} ${docker_script}; """"""; }; }; }; }; ```. ##### Job schedulers. To run Singularity on a job scheduler, the singularity command needs to be passed to the scheduler as a wrapped command. For example, in SLURM, we can use the normal SLURM configuration as explained in the [SLURM documentation](../backends/SLURM), however we'll add a `submit-docker` block to execute when a task is tagged with a docker container. . When constructing this block, there are a few things to keep in mind:; - Make sure Singularity is loaded (and in PATH). If `module` is installed for ; example you can call `module load Singularity`. If the cluster admin has made; a Singularity module available. Alternatively you can alter the `PATH` ; variable directly or simply use `/path/to/singularity` ; directly in the config.; - We should treat worker nodes as if they do not have stable access to the ; internet or build access, so we will pull the container before the task is ; submit to the cluster.; - It's a good idea to use a Singularity cache so that same images should only; have to be pulled once. Make sure you set the `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` ; environment variable to a location on the filesystem that is reachable by the; worker nodes!; - If we are using a cache we need to ensure that submit processes started by; Cromwell do not pull to the same cache at the same time. This may corrupt the; cache. We can prevent this by implementing a filelock with `flock` and ; pulling the image befo",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md:8853,load,loaded,8853,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md,2,['load'],['loaded']

See the [README](README.md#patch-apiworkflowsversionidlabels) for more information.; * Label formatting requirements have been updated, please check the [README](README.md#label-format) for more detailed documentation. ### JES Backend. The JES backend now supports a `filesystems.gcs.caching.duplication-strategy` configuration entry.; It can be set to specify the desired behavior of Cromwell regarding call outputs when a call finds a hit in the cache.; The default value is `copy` which will copy all output files to the new call directory.; A second value is allowed, `reference`, that will instead point to the original output files, without copying them. ```hocon; filesystems {; gcs {; auth = ""application-default"". caching {; duplication-strategy = ""reference""; }; }; }; ```. A placeholder file will be placed in the execution folder of the cached call to explain the absence of output files and point to the location of the original ones. ### Metadata Write Batching. Metadata write batching works the same as in previous versions of Cromwell, but the default batch size has been changed from 1 to 200. It's possible that 200 is too high in some environments, but 200 is more likely to be an appropriate value; than the previous default. ## 27. ### Migration. * Call Caching has been improved in this version of Cromwell, specifically the time needed to determine whether or not a job can be cached; has drastically decreased. To achieve that the database schema has been modified and a migration is required in order to preserve the pre-existing cached jobs.; This migration is relatively fast compared to previous migrations. To get an idea of the time needed, look at the size of your `CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY` table.; As a benchmark, it takes 1 minute for a table with 6 million rows.; The migration will only be executed on MySQL. Other databases will",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:88058,cache,cached,88058,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['cache'],['cached']
Performance,"ow options Cromwell would only look for cache hits for Alice's jobs in Alice's or Bob's buckets. As a further optimization the PAPI backend has the concept of ""this"" bucket on a per-workflow basis, where ""this"" bucket is; the bucket that contains the current workflow root.; If `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` is specified in ; workflow options on the PAPI backend, Cromwell will automatically prepend ""this"" bucket to the call cache hit path prefixes to search.; For example, if Charles specified the same workflow options as in the example above and his workflow root was under `gs://charles_bucket`,; Cromwell would search cache hits in all of the `gs://alice_bucket`, `gs://bob_bucket` and `gs://charles_bucket` buckets without having to specify; `gs://charles_bucket` bucket explicitly in `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes`. If no `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` are specified then all matching cache hits will be considered. ***Call cache failure logging***. When Cromwell fails to cache a job from a previous result the reason will be logged. To reduce the verbosity of the logs; only the first three failure reasons will be logged per shard of each job. Cromwell will continue to try copying; previous results for the call, and when no candidates are left Cromwell will run the job on the backend. **Docker Tags**. Certain Docker tags can impact call caching performance. ; Docker tags are a convenient way to point to a version of an image (`ubuntu:14.04`), or even the latest version (`ubuntu:latest`).; For that purpose, tags are mutable, meaning that the image they point to can change, while the tag name stays the same.; While this is very convenient in some cases, using mutable, or ""floating"" tags in tasks affects the reproducibility of a workflow. ; If you were to run the same workflow using `ubuntu:latest` now, and again in a year (or even in a month) may run with different docker images.; This has an even bigger impact when Call Caching is turned on in Cromwell, and could lead to un",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md:7877,cache,cache,7877,docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,1,['cache'],['cache']

Performance,"r. ## Scope. The 'localization_optional' optimization can be applied to a task's individual input declarations containing files, specifically `File` and `File?` values and any complex types containing them. ; It allows you to save time and money by identifying files which do not need to be localized for the task to succeed. ## Condition. The optimization signals to Cromwell that a task has been written in such a way that:; ; * The task **will work** if Cromwell does localize the specified file inputs; * For example if a file is localized for a local dockerized execution environment. **And**:. * The task will **also** work if Cromwell **does not** localize the same file input; * For example the file remains in a cloud object store and the command is constructed using its URL rather than a local path. ## Effect on File Localization. If the [backend](#backend-support) has been set up to respect `localization_optional`, Cromwell will ; choose not to localize the appropriate file input. ### Effect on Call Caching:. None! . Files marked for optional localization are still treated in exactly the same way as other `File` inputs for call caching. ## Language Support. ### WDL 1.0 (or later). In a WDL 1.0 `task`, this optimization is specified by adding a `localization_optional` field to ; an input's entry in the task's `parameter_meta` section. Here's an example:. ```wdl; task nio_task {; input {; File foo_file; File bar_file; }; ; parameter_meta {; foo_file: {; description: ""a foo file"",; localization_optional: true; }; bar_file: {; description: ""a bar file""; }; }; ; command <<<; # This tool must work for **BOTH** local file paths **AND** object store URL values:; java -jar my_tool_1.jar ~{foo_file}; ; # Because the optimization is not applied to 'bar_file' in parameter_meta, this file **WILL** be localized:; java -jar my_tool_2.jar ~{bar_file}; >>>; }; ```. ## Backend Support.

Refer to udocker's installation documentation [here](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/blob/master/doc/installation_manual.md) for more information. #### Configuration. (As of [2019-02-18](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/issues/112)) udocker does not support looking up docker container by digests, hence you'll have to make ensure `hash-lookup` is disabled. Refer to [this section](#docker-digests) for more detail. To configure `udocker` to work in a local environment, you must tag the provider's configuration to `run-in-background` and update the `submit-docker` to use udocker:; ```; run-in-background = true; submit-docker = """"""; udocker run -v ${cwd}:${docker_cwd} ${docker} ${job_shell} ${docker_script}; """"""; ```. With a job queue like SLURM, you just need to wrap this script in an `sbatch` submission like we did with Singularity:. ```; submit-docker = """"""; # Pull the image using the head node, in case our workers don't have network access; udocker pull ${docker}; ; sbatch \; -J ${job_name} \; -D ${cwd} \; -o ${cwd}/execution/stdout \; -e ${cwd}/execution/stderr \; -t ${runtime_minutes} \; ${""-c "" + cpus} \; --mem-per-cpu=${requested_memory_mb_per_core} \; --wrap ""udocker run -v ${cwd}:${docker_cwd} ${docker} ${job_shell} ${docker_script}""; """"""; ```. #### Caching; udocker caches images in a single directory, which defaults to [`~/.udocker`](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/blob/master/udocker.py#L137), meaning that caching is done on a per-user basis. ; However, like Singularity, if you want to share a cache with other users in your project,you you can override the location of the udocker cache directory either using:; * A config file [described here](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/blob/master/doc/installation_manual.md#9-configuration), conta",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md:15247,queue,queue,15247,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md,2,['queue'],['queue']

Performance,"ric release is expected to continue being done on a cadence of every ~6 months. If you're the lucky ""Release Rotation Engineer"" this time, you should do the following four things:. 1. Create a Jira ticket for the release (look at previous release tickets if you're not sure how).; 1. Check that Cromwell's [nightly integration](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/actions?query=event%3Aschedule) testing is passing.; 1. [Run the publish script to create a new version of Cromwell](#how-to-publish-a-new-cromwell-version); 1. [Run through the ""How to Deploy Cromwell in CaaS prod"" process](#how-to-deploy-cromwell-in-caas-staging-and-caas-prod). ### How to publish a new Cromwell version. #### Announce your intentions. Post a message in `#dsp-workflows-private` letting people know that a publish is imminent in case there are PRs they want to get; wrapped up and merged to `develop` to go out in the forthcoming version of Cromwell. #### Get a Github token. The release WDL uses a github token to perform actions on your behalf.; * Follow the directions [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).; When asked give the token these exact permissions ([example screenshot](github_token_scopes.png)):; * the full set of `repo` permissions; * the `workflow` permission; * only the `read:org` permission (do not let this token administer your organizations!); * only the `user:email` permission (do not let this token administer your user!); * When viewing the token in the [list-view of tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens), its scopes string should read exactly `read:org, repo, user:email, workflow`; * Copy the token and save it to a file on your local machine, for example `~/.github-token`. You'll use it in a second. #### Prepare a temporary `release` directory. Make or copy the following files into a temporary `release/` directory outside the Cromwell repository.

The only user action required is upgrading Cromwell. ### Bug fixes. * Fixed a bug that required Cromwell to be restarted in order to pick up DNS changes.; * By default, the JVM caches DNS records with a TTL of infinity.; * Cromwell now configures its JVM with a 3-minute TTL. This value can be customized by setting `system.dns-cache-ttl`.; * Clarified an error message that Cromwell emits when the compute backend terminates a job of its own volition (as opposed to termination in response to an abort request from Cromwell); * Previously, the error read `The job was aborted from outside Cromwell`; * The new error reads `The compute backend terminated the job. If this termination is unexpected, examine likely causes such as preemption, running out of disk or memory on the compute instance, or exceeding the backend's maximum job duration.`. ## 51 Release Notes. ### Changes and Warnings. The configuration format for call cache blacklisting has been updated, please see the [call caching documentation](; https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Configuring/#call-caching) for details. ### Bug fixes. * Fixed a bug where the `size(...)` function did not work correctly on files; from a shared filesystem if `size(...)` was called in the input section on a; relative path.; + Fixed a bug where the `use_relative_output_paths` option would not preserve intermediate folders. ### New functionality. #### Call caching blacklisting improvements. Cromwell previously supported blacklisting GCS buckets containing cache hits which could not be copied for permissions; reasons. Cromwell now adds support for blacklisting individual cache hits which could not be copied for any reason,; as well as grouping blacklist caches according to a workflow option key.

Performance,"ring. The primary keys of Cromwell's job store tables have been refactored to use a `BIGINT` datatype in place of the previous; `INT` datatype. Cromwell will not be usable during the time the Liquibase migration for this refactor is running.; In the Google Cloud SQL with SSD environment this migration runs at a rate of approximately 40,000 `JOB_STORE_SIMPLETON_ENTRY`; rows per second. In deployments with millions or billions of `JOB_STORE_SIMPLETON_ENTRY` rows the migration may require; a significant amount of downtime so please plan accordingly. The following SQL could be used to estimate the number of; rows in this table:. ```; SELECT table_rows FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'cromwell' AND table_name = 'JOB_STORE_SIMPLETON_ENTRY';; ```. #### Execution Directory Layout (cache copies). When an attempt to copy a cache result is made, you'll now see a `cacheCopy` directory in the call root directory.; This prevents them clashing with the files staged to the same directory for attempt 1 if the cache copy fails (see also: Bug Fixes). The directory layout used to be:. ```; [...]/callRoot/; - script [from the cache copy attempt, or for execution attempt 1 if the cache copy fails]; - stdout [from the cache copy attempt, or for execution attempt 1 if the cache copy fails]; - output.file [from the cache copy attempt, or for execution attempt 1 if the cache copy fails]; - attempt-2/ [if attempt 1 fails]; - script; - stdout; - output.file; ```. but is now:. ```; [...]/callRoot/; - cacheCopy/; - script; - stdout; - output.file; - script [for attempt 1 if the cache copy fails]; - stdout [for attempt 1 if the cache copy fails]; - output.file [for attempt 1 if the cache copy fails]; - attempt-2/ [if attempt 1 fails]; - script; - stdout; - output.file; ```. ### New Functionality. #### Disable call-caching for tasks. It is now possible to indicate in a workflow that a task should not be call-cached.

Performance,"rkflow source> <inputs>`. Read the [Abort](execution/ExecutionTwists/#abort) section to learn more about how abort works. ### Call caching. Call Caching allows Cromwell to detect when a job has been run in the past so it doesn't have to re-compute results. ; To learn more see [Call Caching](cromwell_features/CallCaching). To enable Call Caching, add the following to your Cromwell configuration:. ```; call-caching {; enabled = true; invalidate-bad-cache-results = true; }; ```. When `call-caching.enabled=true` (default: `false`), Cromwell will be able to to reference or copy results from previously run jobs (when appropriate).; When `invalidate-bad-cache-results=true` (default: `true`), Cromwell will invalidate any cache results which contain files that cannot be accessed within a cache-hit. This is usually desired, but might be unwanted if this failure occurs for external reasons, such as a difference in user authentication. Cromwell also accepts [Workflow Options](wf_options/Overview#call-caching-options) to override the cache read/write behavior. . ### Local filesystem options. When running a job on the Config (Shared Filesystem) backend, Cromwell provides some additional options in the backend's ; config section:. ```HOCON; config {; filesystems {; local {; # When localizing a file, what type of file duplication should occur. ; # possible values: ""hard-link"", ""soft-link"", ""copy"", ""cached-copy"".; # For more information check: https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/HPC/#shared-filesystem; localization: [; ""hard-link"", ""soft-link"", ""copy""; ]. caching {; # When copying a cached result, what type of file duplication should occur. ; # possible values: ""hard-link"", ""soft-link"", ""copy"", ""cached-copy"".; # For more information check: https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/HPC/#shared-filesystem; # Attempted in the order listed below:; duplication-strategy: [; ""hard-link"", ""soft-link"", ""copy""; ]. # Possible values: md5, xxh64, fingerprint, path, path+",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md:17734,cache,cache,17734,docs/Configuring.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md,1,['cache'],['cache']

All previous versions of Cromwell shipped with Google Cloud Storage (GCS) libraries that are now deprecated and will [stop working in August 2020](https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/discontinuing-support-for-json-rpc-and.html). This release adopts updated libraries to ensure uninterrupted operation.

Cromwell 37 now; allows abort commands to be sent to any Cromwell instance in the shared-database deployment. Configuration details; [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/Configuring/abort-configuration). ### Call cache blacklisting. The Google Pipelines API (PAPI) version 1 and 2 backends now offer the option of call cache blacklisting on a per-bucket basis.; More info [here](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/CallCaching/#call-cache-copy-authorization-failure-prefix-blacklisting). ### WDL. - All memory units in WDL are now treated as base-2.; For instance `1 KB == 1 KiB == 1024 Bytes`. ### Backend name for call caching purposes. Previous versions of Cromwell incorporated the name of the backend on which a call was run into the call cache hashes generated for that call.; Unfortunately this made it impossible to change the name of a backend without losing all previously run calls as potential cache hits.; Cromwell 37 introduces the `name-for-call-caching-purposes` backend configuration option as a means of decoupling the backend name from the; value used for the backend name for call caching purposes. ### CWL. Support `InputResourceRequirement` hint. ### Changing configuration options. #### Logging Token Distribution. In cases where its not obvious why jobs are queued in Cromwell, you can enable logging for the Job Execution Token Dispenser, using; the `system.hog-safety.token-log-interval-seconds` configuration value. The default, `0`, means that no logging will occur. #### HTTP Filesystem. - The HTTP filesystem is now enabled for engine use by default.

Copying uses a lot of; space if a multitude of tasks use the same input. `cached-copy` copies the file only once to the physical disk containing; the `<workflow_root>` and then uses hard links for every task that needs the input file. This can save a lot of space. The default order in `reference.conf` is `hard-link`, `soft-link`, `copy`. Shared filesystem localization is defined in the `config` section of each backend. The default stanza for the Local and HPC backends looks like this:. ```; filesystems {; local {; localization: [; 	 ""hard-link"", ""soft-link"", ""copy""; ]; }; }; ```. ### Optional docker soft links. By default when Cromwell runs a local container it only mounts the workflow's execution directory. Thus any symbolic or; soft links pointing to files outside of the execution directory will resolve to paths that are not accessible within the; container. As discussed above regarding `cache-copy`, `soft-link` is disabled by default on docker and other container; environments, and hard-links do not work across different physical disks.

Relative paths are interpreted as relative to the current working directory of the Cromwell process. When Cromwell runs a workflow, it first creates a directory `<cromwell_root>/<workflow_uuid>`. This is called the `workflow_root` and it is the root directory for all activity in this workflow. Each `call` has its own subdirectory located at `<workflow_root>/call-<call_name>`. This is the `<call_dir>`.; Any input files to a call need to be localized into the `<call_dir>/inputs` directory. There are different localization strategies that Cromwell will try until one works:. * `hard-link` - This will create a hard link to the file; * `soft-link` - Create a symbolic link to the file. This strategy is not enabled by default for tasks which specify a ; Docker image and will be ignored.; * `copy` - Make a copy the file; * `cached-copy` An experimental feature. This copies files to a file cache in ; `<workflow_root>/cached-inputs` and then hard links them in the `<call_dir>/inputs` directory. . `cached-copy` is intended for a shared filesystem that runs on multiple physical disks, where docker containers are used. ; Hard-links don't work between different physical disks and soft-links don't work with docker by default. Copying uses a lot of; space if a multitude of tasks use the same input. `cached-copy` copies the file only once to the physical disk containing; the `<workflow_root>` and then uses hard links for every task that needs the input file. This can save a lot of space. The default order in `reference.conf` is `hard-link`, `soft-link`, `copy`. Shared filesystem localization is defined in the `config` section of each backend.

In some cases PAPI v2 will report the preemption of a VM in a way that differs from PAPI v1. This novel means of reporting; preemption was not recognized by Cromwell's PAPI v2 backend and would result in preemptions being miscategorized as call failures.; Cromwell's PAPI v2 backend will now handle this type of preemption. ## 43 Release Notes. ### Virtual Private Cloud with Subnetworks.

The `script` file contains:. ```; #!/bin/sh; cd <container_call_root>; <user_command>; echo $? > rc; ```. `<container_call_root>` would be equal to the runtime attribute `dockerWorkingDir` or `/cromwell-executions/<workflow_uuid>/call-<call_name>/execution` if this attribute is not supplied. ### Configuring.

Cromwell uses an exponential backoff strategy to control the rate of requests sent to the TES server. ; Users can override the default settings for this behavior in config, see `cromwell.example.backends/TES.conf` ; for full expected format. For example, to force a constant polling rate rather than exponential backoff:; ```hocon; backend.providers.TES.config.poll-backoff {; min: ""1 minute""; max: ""1 minute""; multiplier: 1; randomization-factor: 0; }; ```. ### Supported File Systems. Currently this backend only works with files on a Local or Shared File System. ### Docker. This backend supports the following optional [Runtime Attributes](../RuntimeAttributes) and [Workflow Options](../wf_options/Overview/) for working with Docker:. * `docker`: Docker image to use such as ""Ubuntu"".; * `dockerWorkingDir`: defines the working directory in the container. ### CPU, Memory and Disk.

However note that some interpolated variables (`${stdout}`, `${stderr}`) are different between these two blocks. #### Docker Digests. Each Docker repository has a number of tags that can be used to refer to the latest image of a particular type. ; For instance, when you run a normal Docker image with `docker run image`, it will actually run `image:latest`, the `latest` tag of that image. However, by default Cromwell requests and runs images using their `sha` hash, rather than using tags.; This strategy is actually preferable, because it ensures every execution of the task or workflow will use the exact same version of the image, but some engines ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md:16336,cache,cache,16336,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md,2,['cache'],['cache']

Call caching hashes with this new strategy are based on the path and the last modified time of the file. ### Instance independent abort. For multi-instance Cromwell deployments sharing a single database, earlier versions of Cromwell required abort; requests to be sent specifically to the instance that was running the targeted workflow. Cromwell 37 now; allows abort commands to be sent to any Cromwell instance in the shared-database deployment. Configuration details; [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/Configuring/abort-configuration). ### Call cache blacklisting. The Google Pipelines API (PAPI) version 1 and 2 backends now offer the option of call cache blacklisting on a per-bucket basis.; More info [here](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/CallCaching/#call-cache-copy-authorization-failure-prefix-blacklisting). ### WDL. - All memory units in WDL are now treated as base-2.; For instance `1 KB == 1 KiB == 1024 Bytes`. ### Backend name for call caching purposes. Previous versions of Cromwell incorporated the name of the backend on which a call was run into the call cache hashes generated for that call.; Unfortunately this made it impossible to change the name of a backend without losing all previously run calls as potential cache hits.; Cromwell 37 introduces the `name-for-call-caching-purposes` backend configuration option as a means of decoupling the backend name from the; value used for the backend name for call caching purposes. ### CWL.

This runtime attribute adds support to disable assigning external IP addresses to VMs provisioned by the Google backend. If set to true, the VM will NOT be provided with a public IP address, and only contain an internal IP. If this option is enabled, the associated job can only load docker images from Google Container Registry, and the job executable cannot use external services other than Google APIs. Note well!

The primary keys of Cromwell's job store tables have been refactored to use a `BIGINT` datatype in place of the previous; `INT` datatype. Cromwell will not be usable during the time the Liquibase migration for this refactor is running.; In the Google Cloud SQL with SSD environment this migration runs at a rate of approximately 40,000 `JOB_STORE_SIMPLETON_ENTRY`; rows per second. In deployments with millions or billions of `JOB_STORE_SIMPLETON_ENTRY` rows the migration may require; a significant amount of downtime so please plan accordingly. The following SQL could be used to estimate the number of; rows in this table:. ```; SELECT table_rows FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'cromwell' AND table_name = 'JOB_STORE_SIMPLETON_ENTRY';; ```. #### Execution Directory Layout (cache copies). When an attempt to copy a cache result is made, you'll now see a `cacheCopy` directory in the call root directory.; This prevents them clashing with the files staged to the same directory for attempt 1 if the cache copy fails (see also: Bug Fixes). The directory layout used to be:. ```; [...]/callRoot/; - script [from the cache copy attempt, or for execution attempt 1 if the cache copy fails]; - stdout [from the cache copy attempt, or for execution attempt 1 if the cache copy fails]; - output.file [from the cache copy attempt, or for execution attempt 1 if the cache copy fails]; - attempt-2/ [if attempt 1 fails]; - script; - stdout; - output.file; ```. but is now:. ```; [...]/callRoot/; - cacheCopy/; - script; - stdout; - output.file; - script [for attempt 1 if the cache copy fails]; - stdout [for attempt 1 if the cache copy fails]; - output.file [for attempt 1 if the cache copy fails]; - attempt-2/ [if attempt 1 fails]; - script; - stdout; - output.file; ```. ### New Functionality. #### Disable call-caching for tasks.

Performance,"tionTimeout = 3000; }; }; }; ```. If no override is found for `metadata`, Cromwell falls back to using the settings under the root `database` configuration. **Database Time Zones**. Cromwell's default configuration assumes that its MySQL database is set to UTC. The following MySQL configurations typically default to UTC and work with Cromwell out of the box:; - Google CloudSQL; - An official MySQL image running in Docker. These configurations may use the system, or local, time zone instead:; - MySQL installed natively on a workstation or server. If Cromwell fails to start with a message like; ```; The server time zone value 'XXX' is unrecognized or represents more than one time zone.; ```; you can resolve the problem by adding the option `&serverTimezone=UTC` to your database connection URL:; ```hocon; url = ""jdbc:mysql://host/cromwell?rewriteBatchedStatements=true&serverTimezone=UTC""; ```. Using this option does not alter your database's underlying timezone; rather, it causes Cromwell to ""speak UTC"" when communicating with the DB, and the DB server performs the conversion for you. . **Using Cromwell with Postgresql**. To use Postgresql as the database, you will need to install and enable the; Large Object extension. If the extension is present, setting up the database; requires just these commands:. ```; $ createdb cromwell; $ psql -d cromwell -c ""create extension lo;""; ```. Postgresql configuration in Cromwell is very similar to MySQL. An example:. ```hocon; database {; profile = ""slick.jdbc.PostgresProfile$""; db {; driver = ""org.postgresql.Driver""; url = ""jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/cromwell""; user = ""user""; password = ""pass""; port = 5432; connectionTimeout = 5000; }; }; ```. If you want multiple database users to be able to read Cromwell's data from a Postgresql database, you'll need to create a; role that all relevant users have access to, and adjust Cromwell to use this role. This is because each Large Object is owned; by, and only readable by, the role th",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md:11575,perform,performs,11575,docs/Configuring.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md,1,['perform'],['performs']

Performance,"un job is found in the cache, Cromwell will use the results of the previous job instead of re-running it. Cromwell's call cache is maintained in its database. In order for call caching to be used on any previously run jobs,; it is best to configure Cromwell to [point to a MySQL database](../Configuring.md#database) instead of the default; in-memory database. This way any invocation of Cromwell (either with `run` or `server` subcommands) will be able to; utilize results from all calls that are in that database. **Configuring Call Caching**. *Call Caching is disabled by default.* Call Caching can be enabled in your Cromwell; [Configuration](../Configuring.md#call-caching) and the behavior can be modified via; [Workflow Options](../wf_options/Overview.md). If you are adding Workflow options, do not set; [`read_from_cache` or `write_to_cache`](../wf_options/Overview.md#call-caching-options) = false, as it will impact the; following process. Once enabled, Cromwell by default will search the call cache for every `call` statement invocation. * If there was no cache hit, the `call` will be executed as normal. Once finished it will add itself to the cache.; * If there was a cache hit, outputs are either **copied from the original cached job to the new job's output directory**; or **referenced from the original cached job** depending on the Cromwell; [Configuration](../Configuring.md#call-caching) settings. > **Note:** If call caching is enabled, be careful not to change the contents of the output directory for any previously run job. Doing so might cause cache hits in Cromwell to copy over modified data and Cromwell currently does not check that the contents of the output directory changed. Additionally, if any files from a previous job directory are removed, call caching will fail due to missing files. ***File hash caching***.

Performance,"val option is 3.333 seconds. The interval may not be greater than; the TTL. **Heartbeat Failure Shutdown**. Cromwell will automatically shutdown when unable to write heartbeats for a period of time. This period of time may be; adjusted via:. ```hocon; system.workflow-heartbeats {; write-failure-shutdown-duration = 5 minutes; }; ```. The default shutdown duration is 5 minutes. The maximum allowed shutdown duration is the TTL. **Heartbeat Batch Size**. Workflow heartbeats are internally queued by Cromwell and written in batches. When the configurable batch size is; reached, all of the heartbeats within the batch will be written at the same time, even if the heartbeat interval has not; elapsed. This batch threshold may be adjusted via:. ```hocon; system.workflow-heartbeats {; write-batch-size = 100; }; ```. The default batch size is 100. **Heartbeat Threshold**. Cromwell writes one batch of workflow heartbeats at a time. While the internal queue of heartbeats-to-write passes above; a configurable threshold then [instrumentation](developers/Instrumentation.md) may send a metric signal that the; heartbeat load is above normal.

The `IX_WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY_WS` index is removed from `WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY`. The index had low cardinality and workflow pickup is faster without it. Migration time depends on workflow store size, but should be very fast for most installations. Terminal workflows are removed from the workflow store, so only running workflows contribute to the cost. ### Bug fixes. #### Improved `size()` function performance on arrays. Resolved a hotspot in Cromwell to make the `size()` engine function perform much faster on file arrays. Common examples of file arrays could include globs or scatter-gather results. This enhancement applies only to WDL 1.0 and later, because that's when `size()` added [support for arrays](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/main/versions/1.0/SPEC.md#acceptable-compound-input-types). #### Fixed Optional and String Concatenation Bug. As outlined in the [WDL Spec](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/main/versions/1.0/SPEC.md#prepending-a-string-to-an-optional-parameter), concatenating a string with an empty optional now correctly evaluates to the empty string. ### Removals. #### `RESTAPI.md` docs discontinued.

Performance,"viders.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int cpu = 1; # ...; """"""; }; ```. **memory**. When running a workflow, the memory runtime attribute in the task will specify the units of memory. For example, this jobs specifies that it only needs 512 megabytes of memory when running. ```wdl; task hello {; command { echo hello }; runtime { memory: ""512 MB"" }; }; ```. However, it's possible that when submitting jobs to your HPC cluster you want to specify the units in gigabytes. To specify the memory units that the submit command should use, append the units to the memory runtime attribute. For example:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Float? memory_gb; # ...; """"""; }; ```. Now, no matter what unit of memory is used within the task, the value will be converted into gigabytes before it is passed to your submit command. **custom attributes**. You can also declare other runtime attributes that a WDL task may use. For example, suppose you would like to allow the WDL to specify an sge queue in a task, like:. ```wdl; task hello {; command { echo hello }; runtime { sqe_queue: ""short"" }; }; ```. You declare your runtime attribute in your config by adding any other custom value to the `runtime-attributes` section:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; String? sge_queue; # ...; """"""; }; ```. In this case, we've stated that the `sge_queue` is optional. This allows us to reuse WDLs from other pipeline authors who may not have set an `sge_queue`. Alternatively, you can also set a default for the declared runtime attributes. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; String sge_queue = ""short""; # ...; """"""; }; ```. ##### Call Caching based on runtime attributes.

While the default is to launch up to `1` workflow, you can override this by setting:. ```hocon; system.max-workflow-launch-count = 1; ```. ***Abort configuration***.

Cromwell tracks the execution of workflows and stores outputs of task invocations in a SQL database. Cromwell supports either an external MySQL database, or a temporary in-memory database. By default, Cromwell uses an in-memory database which will only live for the duration of the JVM. This provides a quick way to run workflows locally without having to set up MySQL, though it also makes workflow executions somewhat transient. To configure Cromwell to instead point to a MySQL database, first create the empty database. In the example below, the database name is `cromwell`. Then, edit your configuration file `database` stanza, as follows:. ```hocon; database {; profile = ""slick.jdbc.MySQLProfile$""; db {; driver = ""com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver""; url = ""jdbc:mysql://host/cromwell?rewriteBatchedStatements=true""; user = ""user""; password = ""pass""; connectionTimeout = 5000; }; }; ```.

Performance,"y affect the performance of Cromwell. . ### Server. By default the Cromwell server will bind to `0.0.0.0` on port `8000`. ; You can then access it through a browser at `http://localhost:8000`. ; To change these settings, simply edit the following values in your configuration file:. ```; webservice {; port = 9000; interface = 0.0.0.0; }; ```. The above configuration will use port `9000`. Cromwell uses `akka-http` to serve requests. For more advanced configuration settings, refer to the [akka-http](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/configuration.html) documentation. For example, to increase the request timeout to 30 seconds you can add this stanza to your configuration file:. ```; akka.http.server.request-timeout = 30s; ```. ### I/O. **I/O Throttling**. Certain [backends](backends/Backends) impose I/O limits. For example the Pipelines API imposes a quota on the number of queries that can be made per second. You can effectively control and throttle the number of requests and resources allocated to those operations in the `system.io` configuration:. ```; system.io {; number-of-requests = 100000; per = 100 seconds; }; ```. **I/O Resilience**. I/O operations can fail for a number of reason from network failures to server errors. Some of those errors are not fatal and can be retried. Cromwell will retry I/O operations on such retryable errors, for a limited number of times before giving up and failing. This number (more precisely the number of attempts that will be made) can be set using the following configuration option:. ```; system.io {; number-of-attempts = 5; }; ```. ### Workflows. **Max Concurrent Workflows**. Cromwell has a configurable cap on the number of workflows running at a time. You can adjust the limit from the default `5000` by setting:. ```hocon; system.max-concurrent-workflows = 5000; ```. **New Workflow Poll Rate**. Cromwell will look for new workflows to start on a regular interval, configured as a number of seconds.

Thus any symbolic or; soft links pointing to files outside of the execution directory will resolve to paths that are not accessible within the; container. As discussed above regarding `cache-copy`, `soft-link` is disabled by default on docker and other container; environments, and hard-links do not work across different physical disks. However, it is possible to manually configure Cromwell to mount input paths such that soft links resolve outside and; inside containers. ```hocon; backend {; default = ""SlurmDocker""; providers {; SlurmDocker {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; String? docker; """"""; # https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html; submit-docker = """"""; set -euo pipefail; CACHE_DIR=$HOME/.singularity/cache; mkdir -p $CACHE_DIR; LOCK_FILE=$CACHE_DIR/singularity_pull_flock; DOCKER_NAME=$(sed -e 's/[^A-Za-z0-9._-]/_/g' <<< ${docker}); IMAGE=$CACHE_DIR/$DOCKER_NAME.sif; (; flock --verbose --exclusive --timeout 900 9 || exit 1; if [ ! -e ""$IMAGE"" ]; then; singularity build $IMAGE docker://${docker}; fi; ) 9>$LOCK_FILE; sbatch \; -J ${job_name} \; -D ${cwd} \; -o ${cwd}/execution/stdout \; -e ${cwd}/execution/stderr \; --wrap ""singularity exec --containall --bind ${cwd}:${docker_cwd} --bind /mnt/one:/mnt/one:ro --bind /mnt/two:/mnt/two:ro $IMAGE ${job_shell} ${docker_script}""; """"""; # ... other configuration ...; filesystems {; local {; caching.duplication-strategy = [""copy""]; localization = [""soft-link"", ""copy""]; docker.allow-soft-links: true; }; }; }; }; }; }; ```. The important parts of the example configuration above are:; * `config.filesystems.local.docker.allow-soft-links` set to `true`; * `config.submit-docker` containing `--bind /mnt/one:/mnt/one:ro --bind /mnt/two:/mnt/two:ro`.

Performance,"ySQL container is [mounted to `compose/mysql/data`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/develop/scripts/docker-compose-mysql/compose/mysql/init), which allows the data to survive a `docker-compose down`. To disable this feature, simply remove the `./compose/mysql/data:/var/lib/mysql` line in the [volume section of `docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/scripts/docker-compose-mysql/docker-compose.yml). Note that in such case, the data will still be preserved by a `docker-compose stop` that stops the container but doesn't delete it. **Notes**. To run Cromwell in the background, add `-d` at the end of the command:; `docker-compose up -d`. To then see the logs for a specific service, run `docker-compose logs -f <service>`. ; For example `docker-compose logs -f cromwell`. For more information about docker compose: [Docker compose doc](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). **Insert Batch Size**. Cromwell queues up and then inserts batches of records into the database for increased performance. You can adjust the; number of database rows batch inserted by Cromwell as follows:. ```hocon; database {; insert-batch-size = 2000; }; ```. **Separate Metadata Database**. This feature should be considered _experimental_ and likely to change in the future. Cromwell stores metadata about each job and workflow intended. This metadata is intended for end users, and includes paths to job results, start and end times, etc. The metadata grows at a significantly faster rate than the rest of the internal engine data. To use a separate database for metadata, under the `database` config section, configure a sub-path for `metadata` with custom settings. ```hocon; database {; # Store metadata in a file on disk that can grow much larger than RAM limits.; metadata {; profile = ""slick.jdbc.HsqldbProfile$""; db {; driver = ""org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver""; url = ""jdbc:hsqldb:file:metadata-db-file-path;shutdown=false;hsqldb.tx=mvcc""; connectionTimeout = 3000; };",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md:9491,queue,queues,9491,docs/Configuring.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md,2,"['perform', 'queue']","['performance', 'queues']"

Call caching hashes with this new strategy are based on the path and the last modified time of the file. ### Instance independent abort. For multi-instance Cromwell deployments sharing a single database, earlier versions of Cromwell required abort; requests to be sent specifically to the instance that was running the targeted workflow. Cromwell 37 now; allows abort commands to be sent to any Cromwell instance in the shared-database deployment. Configuration details; [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/Configuring/abort-configuration). ### Call cache blacklisting. The Google Pipelines API (PAPI) version 1 and 2 backends now offer the option of call cache blacklisting on a per-bucket basis.; More info [here](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/CallCaching/#call-cache-copy-authorization-failure-prefix-blacklisting). ### WDL. - All memory units in WDL are now treated as base-2.; For instance `1 KB == 1 KiB == 1024 Bytes`. ### Backend name for call caching purposes. Previous versions of Cromwell incorporated the name of the backend on which a call was run into the call cache hashes generated for that call.; Unfortunately this made it impossible to change the name of a backend without losing all previously run calls as potential cache hits.; Cromwell 37 introduces the `name-for-call-caching-purposes` backend configuration option as a means of decoupling the backend name from the; value used for the backend name for call caching purposes. ### CWL.

For Cloud Life Sciences v2beta only. When a user's GCP project reaches a quota limit, Cromwell continues to submit jobs and Life Sciences acknowledges them as created even if the physical VM cannot yet start. Cromwell now detects this condition in the backend and reports `AwaitingCloudQuota`. The status is informational and does not require any action. Users wishing to maximize throughput can use `AwaitingCloudQuota` as an indication they should check quota in Cloud Console and request a quota increase from GCP. `AwaitingCloudQuota` will appear between the `Initializing` and `Running` backend statuses, and will be skipped if not applicable.

Disadvantages:. * Slower. ### Abort. **Control-C (SIGINT) abort handler**. For backends that support aborting jobs, Cromwell can be configured to automatically try to abort all calls when it receives a Control-C, also known as SIGINT. All currently running calls will also set their status to `Aborted`. To explicitly turn this feature on or off, set the configuration option:. ```hocon; system {; abort-jobs-on-terminate=true; }; ```. Or, via `-Dsystem.abort-jobs-on-terminate=true` command line option. By default, this value is false when running `java -jar cromwell.jar server`, and true when running `java -jar cromwell.jar run <workflow source> <inputs>`.

Call Caching allows Cromwell to detect when a job has been run in the past so it doesn't have to re-compute results. ; To learn more see [Call Caching](cromwell_features/CallCaching). To enable Call Caching, add the following to your Cromwell configuration:. ```; call-caching {; enabled = true; invalidate-bad-cache-results = true; }; ```. When `call-caching.enabled=true` (default: `false`), Cromwell will be able to to reference or copy results from previously run jobs (when appropriate).; When `invalidate-bad-cache-results=true` (default: `true`), Cromwell will invalidate any cache results which contain files that cannot be accessed within a cache-hit. This is usually desired, but might be unwanted if this failure occurs for external reasons, such as a difference in user authentication.

An example using the new format is:; ```; ""callCaching"": {; ""hit"": false,; ""effectiveCallCachingMode"": ""ReadAndWriteCache"",; ""result"": ""Cache Miss"",; ""allowResultReuse"": true; }; ```. ### Config Changes. * Added a field `insert-batch-size` to the `database` stanza which defines how many values from a batch insert will be processed at a time. This value defaults to 2000.; * Moved the config value `services.MetadataService.metadata-summary-refresh-interval` to `services.MetadataService.config.metadata-summary-refresh-interval`; * Added ability to override the default zone(s) used by JES via the config structure by setting `genomics.default-zones` in the JES configuration; * The cromwell server TCP binding timeout is now configurable via the config key `webservice.binding-timeout`, defaulted; to the previous value `5s` (five seconds) via the reference.conf.; * For MySQL users, a massive scalability improvement via batched DB writing of internal metadata events.

Safety," Poll Rate**. Cromwell will look for new workflows to start on a regular interval, configured as a number of seconds. You can change the polling rate from the default `20` seconds by editing the value:. ```hocon; system.new-workflow-poll-rate = 20; ```. **Max Workflow Launch Count**. On every poll, Cromwell will take at limited number of new submissions, provided there are new workflows to launch and the `system.max-concurrent-workflows` number has not been reached. While the default is to launch up to `1` workflow, you can override this by setting:. ```hocon; system.max-workflow-launch-count = 1; ```. ***Abort configuration***. Cromwell will scan for abort requests using default configuration values equivalent to those below. In most circumstances; there shouldn't be a need to override these defaults. ```hocon; system {; abort {; # How frequently Cromwell should scan for aborts.; scan-frequency: 30 seconds. # The cache of in-progress aborts. Cromwell will add entries to this cache once a WorkflowActor has been messaged to abort.; # If on the next scan an 'Aborting' status is found for a workflow that has an entry in this cache, Cromwell will not ask; # the associated WorkflowActor to abort again.; cache {; # Guava cache concurrency.; concurrency: 1; # How long entries in the cache should live from the time they are added to the cache.; ttl: 20 minutes; # Maximum number of entries in the cache.; size: 100000; }; }; }; ```. ### Database. **Using a MySQL Database**. Cromwell tracks the execution of workflows and stores outputs of task invocations in a SQL database. Cromwell supports either an external MySQL database, or a temporary in-memory database. By default, Cromwell uses an in-memory database which will only live for the duration of the JVM. This provides a quick way to run workflows locally without having to set up MySQL, though it also makes workflow executions somewhat transient.

Safety," abort request to the Google Pipelines API. When Pipelines API indicates that the status of the job is aborted, Cromwell will mark it as such.; Remember that abort action is entirely dependent on the backend. In this particular case, Pipelines API does not guarantee the success of an abort request (see [Pipelines API documentation on abort](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/reference/rest/v1alpha2/operations/cancel)). You'll also notice that the workflow is finalized even though being aborted.; Finalization is the last step in the execution of a workflow and a chance for each backend to do some work before the workflow is terminated.; Backends won't be denied the chance to finalize the workflow even if it's being aborted. _Note that by the time the backend is asked to abort a job, the job may have succeeded or failed already. In this case Cromwell will report the job's status (successful or failed)._. _If a job fails with a retryable failure (e.g is preempted), it will **not** be attempted again when the workflow is aborting._. ## Restart. When Cromwell restarts (for example to upgrade to a new version) it will reconnect to all workflows that were in progress. On the Google and HPC backends only, Cromwell will additionally attempt to reconnect to all running jobs. Note that a workflow; does not ""belong"" to any one Cromwell instance (it belongs to the cluster), so a different instance in a horizontal cluster might reconnect to the workflow instead of the original. If the workflow was in state `Aborting`, Cromwell will ask all running jobs to abort again. No new jobs will be started. Once all jobs have been reconnected to, the workflow will keep running normally. During the reconnection process Cromwell might ask backends to reconnect to jobs that were never started before the restart. In that case, the job will be mark as failed with an explanation message. This failure is benign and only an artifact of the fact that Cromwell was restarted. ; If the backend does not ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md:4834,abort,aborting,4834,docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,1,['abort'],['aborting']

It's possible that if the task is very short that the log file does not flush before de-localization happens and you will end up with a zero byte file. **Google Cloud Storage Filesystem**. On the Google Pipelines backend the GCS (Google Cloud Storage) filesystem is used for the root of the workflow execution.; On the Local, SGE, and associated backends any GCS URI will be downloaded locally. For the Google backend the `jes_gcs_root` [Workflow Option](../wf_options/Google) will take; precedence over the `root` specified at `backend.providers.JES.config.root` in the configuration file. Google Cloud Storage URIs are the only acceptable values for `File` inputs for; workflows using the Google backend. **Pipeline timeout**. Google sets a default pipeline timeout of 7 days, after which the pipeline will abort. Setting `pipeline-timeout` overrides this limit to a maximum of 30 days. ```hocon; backend.providers.PAPIv2.config {; pipeline-timeout: 14 days; }; ```. #### Quota retry. Typically, Life Sciences API is designed to accept all jobs sent to it and respond to quota exhaustion; by queueing jobs internally. However, there are cases when jobs fail instead of queueing, with messages such; as ""PAPI error code 9"", ""no available zones"", and/or ""quota too low"". The following configuration permits Cromwell to detect and retry these failures. Proactively monitoring; and raising quota is still recommended. ```hocon; backend.providers.PAPIv2.config {; # Counts attempts (total jobs) not just retries after to the first; quota-attempts: 20; }; ```. **Enabling FUSE capabilities**. *This is a community contribution and not officially supported by the Cromwell team.*; By default Cromwell task containers doesn't allow to mount any FUSE filesystems.

Safety," is when a [preemptible VM](../RuntimeAttributes/#preemptible) is preempted. . In the example above, if B's failure is retryable then B will be retried (shaded yellow and green). The workflow will keep running normally, regardless of which failure mode is enabled. ![](CWP_B_retryable_fail_then_success.png). Using the previous example, let's imagine **B** failed from a **non-retryable** failure (shaded red). After B failed, **A** fails from a **retryable** failure. Now Cromwell's behavior will depend on the failure mode. **`NoNewCalls`** ; If the failure mode is `NoNewCalls`, then A **will not be** retried (yellow).

This section explains what that entails. When aborting a workflow, either through the `/abort` endpoint or by terminating the [Cromwell run process](../Modes) (if [configured](../Configuring#abort) to do so), Cromwell does the following:. 1. Changes the status of the workflow to `Aborting`,; 2. Does not start any new jobs,; 3. Asks every running job to abort,; 4. Waits for all running jobs to complete,; 5. Finalizes the workflow,; 6. Changes the status of the workflow to `Aborted`. The action of aborting a job is backend specific. Cromwell can only ask a backend to abort a job and wait for the backend to notify it when it is aborted. . For example, if you are running Cromwell on the Google backend and abort a job, Google will send an abort request to the Google Pipelines API. When Pipelines API indicates that the status of the job is aborted, Cromwell will mark it as such.; Remember that abort action is entirely dependent on the backend.

Within a running workflow, the backend is used in the following manner:. * Initialization: Initialization routine called the first time a workflow uses a backend; * Execute: The workflow requests that the backend run a job; * Recover: Attempt to reconnect to a previously started job. An example of this would be if Cromwell was restarted and; wanted to reattach to currently running jobs.; * Abort: Request that a running job be halted; * Finalization: When a workflow is complete, allows for any workflow level cleanup to take place. The initialization and finalization steps are optional and are provided for cases where a backend needs that behavior;; not all backends will need these. The implementations of both the recover and abort steps are up to the backend developer. For instance the recover; function could be implemented to actually perform an execution and/or the abort function could be written to do nothing; at all. Implementing these in a more robust manner is recommended for most cases but neither are universally; appropriate. ### How do I create a Backend?.

Safety," option:. ```; system.io {; number-of-attempts = 5; }; ```. ### Workflows. **Max Concurrent Workflows**. Cromwell has a configurable cap on the number of workflows running at a time. You can adjust the limit from the default `5000` by setting:. ```hocon; system.max-concurrent-workflows = 5000; ```. **New Workflow Poll Rate**. Cromwell will look for new workflows to start on a regular interval, configured as a number of seconds. You can change the polling rate from the default `20` seconds by editing the value:. ```hocon; system.new-workflow-poll-rate = 20; ```. **Max Workflow Launch Count**. On every poll, Cromwell will take at limited number of new submissions, provided there are new workflows to launch and the `system.max-concurrent-workflows` number has not been reached. While the default is to launch up to `1` workflow, you can override this by setting:. ```hocon; system.max-workflow-launch-count = 1; ```. ***Abort configuration***. Cromwell will scan for abort requests using default configuration values equivalent to those below. In most circumstances; there shouldn't be a need to override these defaults. ```hocon; system {; abort {; # How frequently Cromwell should scan for aborts.; scan-frequency: 30 seconds. # The cache of in-progress aborts. Cromwell will add entries to this cache once a WorkflowActor has been messaged to abort.; # If on the next scan an 'Aborting' status is found for a workflow that has an entry in this cache, Cromwell will not ask; # the associated WorkflowActor to abort again.; cache {; # Guava cache concurrency.; concurrency: 1; # How long entries in the cache should live from the time they are added to the cache.; ttl: 20 minutes; # Maximum number of entries in the cache.; size: 100000; }; }; }; ```. ### Database. **Using a MySQL Database**.

Cromwell uses `docker kill` to kill the Docker container. ## 29 Release Notes. ### Breaking Changes. * **Command line**; In preparation for supporting CWL scripts (yes, you read that right!), we have extensively revised the Command Line in Cromwell 29. For more details about the usage changes please see the [README](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell#command-line-usage). And stay tuned to the [WDL/Cromwell blog](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/blog) over the next couple of months for more news about CWL. * **Request timeouts**; Cromwell now returns more specific `503 Service Unavailable` error codes on request timeouts, rather than the more generic `500 Internal Server Error`. The response for a request timeout will now be plain text, rather than a JSON format. * **Metadata endpoint**; The response from the metadata endpoint can be quite large depending on your workflow. You can now opt-in to have Cromwell gzip your metadata file, in order to reduce file size, by sending the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header. The default behavior now does not gzip encode responses. * **Engine endpoints**; Previously the engine endpoints were available under `/api/engine` but now the endpoints are under `/engine` so they don't require authentication. Workflow endpoints are still available under `/api/workflows`. We also deprecated the setting `api.routeUnwrapped` as a part of this internal consistency effort. * **Call caching diff**; We updated the response format of the [callcaching/diff](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell#get-apiworkflowsversioncallcachingdiff) endpoint. ### Other changes. * **Cromwell server**; When running in server mode, Cromwell now attempts to gracefully shutdown after receiving a `SIGINT",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:82041,timeout,timeout,82041,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['timeout'],['timeout']

These variables will then be passed from the WDL into the submit configuration. If one would like to have a default value, just like in WDL, the configuration may specify that the value have a default. The default must match the defined type or an error will be produced. ```; backend {; providers {; SGE {; config {; # ... other configuration; runtime-attributes = """"""; Float memory_mb = 2.0; String sge_project = ""default""; """"""; }; }; }; }; ```. Optional values may also be used by appending `?` to the type:. ```; backend {; providers {; SGE {; config {; # ... other configuration; runtime-attributes = """"""; Float? memory_mb; String? sge_project; """"""; }; }; }; }; ```. The value will be passed to the submit configuration if provided, and omitted otherwise. There are also configuration values related to how jobs are rechecked on startup and aborted. The option is `backend.providers.<backend>.config.run-in-background`. When `true` the backend runs the submit configuration and records the unix process id (PID). To abort the job, the PID is stopped with the unix command `kill`. Upon a cromwell restart, the PID is checked via the unix command `ps` to see if it is still alive, before cromwell goes back to polling for the `rc` file. When `backend.providers.<backend>.config.run-in-background` is `false`, the default, the backend must specify how read the job identifier from the stdout of the submit, how to kill the job, and how to check if the job is still running during a cromwell restart. These three configuration values are `job-id-regex`, `kill`, and `check-alive`, respectively:. ```; backend {; providers {; SGE {; config {; # ... other configuration; job-id-regex = ""(\\d+)""; kill = ""qdel ${job_id}""; check-alive = ""qstat -j ${job_id}""; """"""; }; }; }; }; ```.

Because the system is not a simple first-in-first-out, it can be valuable to see the status of all ; the existing queues inside Cromwell. . To have this information logged on a regular basis, you can enable periodic queue logging. This will; also alert you at the same frequency when events are happening, such as hog groups being at their individual limits. * You can enable logging for the Job Execution Token Dispenser, using; the `system.hog-safety.token-log-interval-seconds` configuration value.; * The default, `0`, means that no logging will occur. ## Effects. ### Job Execution. #### Reserving Space. - Cromwell allows administrators to designate an overall maximum concurrent job limit per; [backend](../backends/Backends.md#backend-job-limits). ; - Within that limit, a hog factor allows us to limit the maximum concurrent jobs started *per hog group*.; + This is what allows new jobs to run immediately even if many jobs from bigger workflows are already queued up. #### Round robin allocation. Rather than starting jobs on a strict first-come first served basis, Cromwell now assigns in a round-robin; fashion between hog groups and then on a first-come-first-served *within* a hog group. In other words if the hog groups had the following entries queued up:; ```; A: jobA1, jobA2, jobA3, ..., jobA1000000; B: jobB1, jobB2; C: jobC1; D: jobD1, jobD2; ```.

Note that a workflow; does not ""belong"" to any one Cromwell instance (it belongs to the cluster), so a different instance in a horizontal cluster might reconnect to the workflow instead of the original. If the workflow was in state `Aborting`, Cromwell will ask all running jobs to abort again. No new jobs will be started. Once all jobs have been reconnected to, the workflow will keep running normally. During the reconnection process Cromwell might ask backends to reconnect to jobs that were never started before the restart. In that case, the job will be mark as failed with an explanation message. This failure is benign and only an artifact of the fact that Cromwell was restarted. ; If the backend does not support reconnection to an existing job, jobs will be marked as failed with an explanation message as well. The backend status of the jobs will be ""Unknown"". ## Graceful Shutdown. When Cromwell is run as a server, it will by default attempt to gracefully shutdown, stopping its different services in a specific order to avoid losing critical data.; This behavior, documented below, can be turned off in the configuration via `system.graceful-server-shutdown = false`. Upon receiving a `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` signal, the JVM will initiate its shutdown process. Prior to this Cromwell will attempt to shutdown its own services in the following way:. 1. Workflows in `Submitted` state are no longer started; 2. Cromwell unbinds from the address/port it was listening on. From this point the Cromwell server is unreachable via the endpoints.; 3. All actors generating data that needs to be persisted receive a message asking them to gracefully stop.; This means that they are given some time (see below for how much and how to change it) to return to a known ""consistent"" state.; For example, an actor waiting for a response from the database before sending information to the metadata will wait for that response before shutting itself down.; 4.

For example, say you normally submit jobs to SGE using:. ```bash; qsub -terse -V -b y -N my_job_name \; -wd /path/to/working_directory \; -o /path/to/stdout.qsub \; -e /path/to/stderr.qsub \; -pe smp 1 -l mem_free=0.5g -q short \; /usr/bin/env bash myScript.bash; ```. For this particular SGE cluster, the above sets the working directory, stdout and stderr paths, the number of cpus to 1, the memory to half a gigabyte, and runs on the short queue. Converting this into a template using our runtime attributes requires defining `submit` as one would a WDL task `command`:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; submit = """"""; qsub \; -terse \; -V \; -b y \; -N ${job_name} \; -wd ${cwd} \; -o ${out}.qsub \; -e ${err}.qsub \; -pe smp ${cpu} \; ${""-l mem_free="" + memory_gb + ""g""} \; ${""-q "" + sge_queue} \; ${""-P "" + sge_project} \; /usr/bin/env bash ${script}; """"""; }; ```. When the job finishes submitting, Cromwell will need to retrieve the job id, so that it can abort the job if necessary. This job should be written to the stdout after submission, where Cromwell will then read the job id. Because the job id may be surrounded by other text, a custom regular expression should capture the actual job id. Because the submit above uses `-terse`, the job id will be the entire contents of the stdout, but should be all digits:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; job-id-regex = ""(\\d+)""; }; ```. #### How Cromwell should abort an HPC job. When aborting an HPC job, Cromwell will run a command confifured under the key `kill`, passing in the WDL variable `job_id`:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; kill = ""qdel ${job_id}""; }; ```. #### How Cromwell checks if an HPC job is alive. Whenever Cromwell restarts it checks to see if a job has completed by searching for return code in a file called `rc`.

Safety,"# The 'Checkpoint File' Optimization. ## Overview. Available in Cromwell 55 and higher. This optimization provides a way to mitigate the problem of long-running tasks getting preempted partway through execution. It allows the user to save intermediates of a task at regularly scheduled checkpoints. After an interruption, the task can be restarted from the last saved checkpoint, thereby avoiding having to re-run the entire computation again. ### Description. Specifying a `checkpointFile` value in a task's `runtime` section designates a checkpoint file which will periodically be; copied to cloud storage every 10 minutes. This checkpoint file will then be restored automatically on subsequent attempts if the job is interrupted. Once the final output has been successfully generated, the checkpoint file will be deleted. To use this feature effectively, the WDL task must be written intentionally to use the checkpoint file. See example below. . ### Effects on cloud charges. Charges will accrue from storing the checkpoint file during the running of the task, and additional charges may apply to the transfer between the VM and the cloud storage bucket depending on their locations. These costs should be minor, especially balanced against the performance and cost benefits of being able to restore from the checkpoint when a worker VM gets preempted. Since the checkpoint file is deleted after successful completion of the task, no further charges will accrue after completion. However, if the task is aborted or otherwise stopped externally, ie through interruption of Cromwell's operation, the checkpoint file will NOT be deleted and storage charges will continue to accrue indefinitely, or until the file is deleted manually. . ### Effect on Call Caching. The presence or absence of the `checkpointFile` attribute is not considered when determining whether to call cache. . ### Example. The following WDL demonstrates the use of the `checkpointFile` optimization.

Safety,"# Workflow Execution: Database Tables: Workflow, Subworkflow, and Job Stores. ## Database Tables: Workflow, Subworkflow, and Job Stores. Cromwell uses the workflow, subworkflow and job store tables to hold data related to submitted or running workflows.; Once a workflow reaches a terminal state all data for that workflow should be deleted from these tables. ### Workflow Store / `WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY`. `WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY` holds data received in a workflow submission (workflow sources, inputs, options etc.); and workflow-scoped execution data (e.g. submission time, status, fields to support; running [Horizontal Cromwell](../horicromtal.md) etc). ### Job Store / `JOB_STORE_ENTRY`. `JOB_STORE_ENTRY` holds data for *completed* jobs within a workflow. Jobs that are still running or have not yet been; started will not have rows in this table. The main purpose of the job store table is to support resuming execution of; a workflow when Cromwell is restarted by recovering the outputs of completed jobs. This table is closely related to; `JOB_STORE_SIMPLETON_ENTRY` which holds the [simpleton](../general/simpletons.md) values comprising a job's outputs,; and loosely related to the [job key/value store (`JOB_KEY_VALUE_ENTRY`)](jobKeyValueStore.md) which holds other; job-scoped data important in recovering jobs on Cromwell restart. ### Subworkflow Store / `SUB_WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY`. `SUB_WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY` holds data for subworkflows that have begun execution. The rows in this table persist the fact; that particular subworkflows corresponding to a call FQN and index were started and assigned a workflow ID.; The completed jobs within these subworkflows will be recorded in the job store described above, linking to the; subworkflows in this table by the subworkflow's ID.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/bitesize/workflowExecution/workflowSubworkflowAndJobStores.md:969,recover,recovering,969,docs/developers/bitesize/workflowExecution/workflowSubworkflowAndJobStores.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/bitesize/workflowExecution/workflowSubworkflowAndJobStores.md,4,['recover'],['recovering']

Safety,"## Getting started on HPC clusters. ### Prerequisites. This tutorial page relies on completing the previous tutorials:. * [Configuration Files](ConfigurationFiles.md). ### Goals. At the end of this tutorial you'll have set up Cromwell to run against your HPC cluster. We'll use SGE as an example but this applies equally to LSF and others. ### Let's get started!. ####. #### Telling Cromwell the type of backend. Start by defining your new backend configuration under the section `backend`. For now, we'll give your backend the name `SGE`, but you can use any name you would like. ```hocon; backend {; providers {; SGE {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; # to be filled in; }; }; }; }; ```. The `actor-factory` above tells cromwell that you will be using the `config` section to tell cromwell how to submit jobs, abort jobs, etc. You'll likely also want to change the default backend to your new backend, by setting this configuration value:. ```hocon; backend.default = SGE; ```. #### Specifying the runtime attributes for your HPC tasks. In the config section for your backend, you can define the different [runtime attributes](../RuntimeAttributes) that your HPC tasks will support. Any runtime attribute configured here will be read from the WDL tasks, and then passed into the command line used to submit jobs to the HPC cluster. All runtime attributes must be defined in a single multi-line block. The syntax of this block is the same as defining the inputs for a WDL task. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int cpu = 1; Float? memory_gb; String? sge_queue; String? sge_project; """"""; }; ```. In the example above, we have defined four different WDL variables defined, `cpu`, `memory_gb`, `sge_queue`, and `sge_project`. Below you will find more information on `cpu` and `memory`, and the ability to add custom runtime attributes like the `sge_queue` and `sge_project`. **cpu**.

See the [Server Section](Configuring#server) of the configuration for more information on how to configure it. Follow the [Server Tutorial](tutorials/ServerMode) to get your Cromwell server up and running in a few steps. ## Run. A good way to get started with Cromwell and experiment quickly. Run mode launches a single workflow from the command line and exits `0` or `1` to indicate the result. Appropriate for prototyping or demo use on a user's local machine. Features are limited and the web API is not supported.

Safety,"(called phase) has its own timeout.; If the phase does not complete within the given timeout, actors will be forcefully stopped and the next phase will start. This logic is implemented using [Akka Coordinated Shutdown Extension](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/actors.html#coordinated-shutdown). Currently Cromwell is running [version 2.5.4](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.4/scala/actors.html#coordinated-shutdown).; It comes with a set of pre-defined phases, that can be added on and modified. Those phases can be linked together to form a Graph. Cromwell shutdown graphs looks as such:. ![Scaladoc](CromwellShutdownProcess.png). Pre-defined but unused phases have been omitted (cluster related phases for example that are irrelevant in Cromwell). You'll notice the presence of a `PhaseAbortAllWorkflows` phase. This phase is at the same level as the `PhaseServiceRequestsDone` phase which corresponds to our step #3 above.; The reason for a specific abort phase is so that its timeout can be configured differently than the normal shutdown phase. Indeed, stopping all workflows and aborting them is very similar from an outside perspective. We send a message (resp. ""Stop"" and ""Abort"") and wait for a response. In the case where you want to be able to give more time to abort, as it will likely involve more work, you can edit the value of `coordinated-shutdown.phases.abort-all-workflows.timeout` which defaults to 1 hour.; Phases timeouts default to 5 seconds, except the stop-io-activity phase which defaults to 30 minutes. This is because depending on the Database load at the time of the shutdown, it might take a significant amount of time to flush all pending writes. All of the timeouts are configurable in the `akka.coordinated-shutdown.phases` section ([see the latest `reference.conf`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akka/akka/master/akka-actor/src/main/resources/reference.conf)).; To change the default timeout, change the value of `akka.coordinated-shutdown.default-p",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md:8605,abort,abort,8605,docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,2,"['abort', 'timeout']","['abort', 'timeout']"

This section explains what that entails. When aborting a workflow, either through the `/abort` endpoint or by terminating the [Cromwell run process](../Modes) (if [configured](../Configuring#abort) to do so), Cromwell does the following:. 1. Changes the status of the workflow to `Aborting`,; 2. Does not start any new jobs,; 3. Asks every running job to abort,; 4. Waits for all running jobs to complete,; 5. Finalizes the workflow,; 6. Changes the status of the workflow to `Aborted`. The action of aborting a job is backend specific. Cromwell can only ask a backend to abort a job and wait for the backend to notify it when it is aborted. . For example, if you are running Cromwell on the Google backend and abort a job, Google will send an abort request to the Google Pipelines API. When Pipelines API indicates that the status of the job is aborted, Cromwell will mark it as such.; Remember that abort action is entirely dependent on the backend. In this particular case, Pipelines API does not guarantee the success of an abort request (see [Pipelines API documentation on abort](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/reference/rest/v1alpha2/operations/cancel)). You'll also notice that the workflow is finalized even though being aborted.; Finalization is the last step in the execution of a workflow and a chance for each backend to do some work before the workflow is terminated.; Backends won't be denied the chance to finalize the workflow even if it's being aborted. _Note that by the time the backend i",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md:3560,abort,aborting,3560,docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,1,['abort'],['aborting']

The FTP filesystem supports a global configuration. The goal is to configure values that will apply Cromwell-wide, as opposed to other configuration that could be backend (or engine) specific (see below). Default configuration:. ```hocon; filesystems.ftp.global.config = {; # This value should be sufficiently high to cover for the duration of the longest expected I/O operation.; # It is a time to live value after which a filesystem (unique per user per server) will be closed and evicted from the cache if unused for the specified duration.; cache-ttl = 1 day; ; # How long to wait trying to obtain a connection from the pool before giving up. Don't specify for no timeout; # obtain-connection-timeout = 1 hour; ; # Maximum number of connections that will be established per user per ftp server. This is across the entire Cromwell instance.; # Setting this number allows to workaround FTP server restrictions for the number of connections for a single user per IP address.; # Has to be >= 2 to allow copying (Copying and FTP file requires downloading and uploading it); max-connection-per-server-per-user = 30; ; # Time after which a connection will be closed if idle. This is to try to free connections from a filesystem when it's not heavily used.; idle-connection-timeout = 1 hour; ; # FTP connection port to use; connection-port: 21; ; # FTP connection mode; connection-mode = ""passive""; }. ```. Note that this configuration being global, it applies the same way regardless of the FTP server.

This feature is meant to run a script in the background during long-running processes. It's possible that if the task is very short that the log file does not flush before de-localization happens and you will end up with a zero byte file. **Google Cloud Storage Filesystem**. On the Google Pipelines backend the GCS (Google Cloud Storage) filesystem is used for the root of the workflow execution.; On the Local, SGE, and associated backends any GCS URI will be downloaded locally. For the Google backend the `jes_gcs_root` [Workflow Option](../wf_options/Google) will take; precedence over the `root` specified at `backend.providers.JES.config.root` in the configuration file. Google Cloud Storage URIs are the only acceptable values for `File` inputs for; workflows using the Google backend. **Pipeline timeout**. Google sets a default pipeline timeout of 7 days, after which the pipeline will abort. Setting `pipeline-timeout` overrides this limit to a maximum of 30 days. ```hocon; backend.providers.PAPIv2.config {; pipeline-timeout: 14 days; }; ```. #### Quota retry.

In addition to using configuration files, you can use dot-separated configuration names to specify values directly on the Java command line:. ```; $ java -Dwebservice.port=8080 cromwell.jar ...; ```. ## Advanced configuration. **WARNING:** These advanced configuration values can significantly affect the performance of Cromwell. . ### Server. By default the Cromwell server will bind to `0.0.0.0` on port `8000`. ; You can then access it through a browser at `http://localhost:8000`. ; To change these settings, simply edit the following values in your configuration file:. ```; webservice {; port = 9000; interface = 0.0.0.0; }; ```. The above configuration will use port `9000`. Cromwell uses `akka-http` to serve requests. For more advanced configuration settings, refer to the [akka-http](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/configuration.html) documentation. For example, to increase the request timeout to 30 seconds you can add this stanza to your configuration file:. ```; akka.http.server.request-timeout = 30s; ```. ### I/O. **I/O Throttling**. Certain [backends](backends/Backends) impose I/O limits. For example the Pipelines API imposes a quota on the number of queries that can be made per second. You can effectively control and throttle the number of requests and resources allocated to those operations in the `system.io` configuration:. ```; system.io {; number-of-requests = 100000; per = 100 seconds; }; ```. **I/O Resilience**. I/O operations can fail for a number of reason from network failures to server errors. Some of those errors are not fatal and can be retried. Cromwell will retry I/O operations on such retryable errors, for a limited number of times before giving up and failing. This number (more precisely the number of attempts that will be made) can be set using the following configuration option:. ```; system.io {; number-of-attempts = 5; }; ```. ### Workflows. **Max Concurrent W",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md:2818,timeout,timeout,2818,docs/Configuring.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md,1,['timeout'],['timeout']

HPC backends (as well as the Local backend) can be configured to be able to interact with other type of filesystems, where the input files can be located for example.; Currently the only other filesystem supported is Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

For the Google backend the `jes_gcs_root` [Workflow Option](../wf_options/Google) will take; precedence over the `root` specified at `backend.providers.JES.config.root` in the configuration file. Google Cloud Storage URIs are the only acceptable values for `File` inputs for; workflows using the Google backend. **Pipeline timeout**. Google sets a default pipeline timeout of 7 days, after which the pipeline will abort. Setting `pipeline-timeout` overrides this limit to a maximum of 30 days. ```hocon; backend.providers.PAPIv2.config {; pipeline-timeout: 14 days; }; ```. #### Quota retry. Typically, Life Sciences API is designed to accept all jobs sent to it and respond to quota exhaustion; by queueing jobs internally. However, there are cases when jobs fail instead of queueing, with messages such; as ""PAPI error code 9"", ""no available zones"", and/or ""quota too low"". The following configuration permits Cromwell to detect and retry these failures. Proactively monitoring; and raising quota is still recommended. ```hocon; backend.providers.PAPIv2.config {; # Counts attempts (total jobs) not just retries after to the first; quota-attempts: 20; }; ```. **Enabling FUSE capabilities**. *This is a community contribution and not officially supported by the Cromwell team.*; By default Cromwell task containers doesn't allow to mount any FUSE filesystems. It happens because containers are launched without specific linux capabilities being enabled. ; Google pipelines backend supports running containers with the enabled capabilities and so does Cromwell. . If you need to use fuses within task containers then you can set `enable_fuse` workflow option. . ```; {; ""enable_fuse"": true; }; ```.

These options can override Cromwell's configured call caching behavior for a single workflow. See the [Call Caching](../cromwell_features/CallCaching.md) section for more details and how to set defaults. The call caching section will also explain how these options interact when, for example, one is set `true` and the other is `false`. **Note:** If call caching is disabled, these options will be ignored and the options will be treated as though they were `false`. |Option|Values|Description|; |---|---|---|; |`write_to_cache`|`true` or `false`|If `false`, the completed calls from this workflow will not be added to the cache.

Safety,"Call Caching allows Cromwell to detect when a job has been run in the past so that it doesn't have to re-compute results, saving both time and money. Cromwell searches the cache of previously run jobs for one that has the exact same command and exact same inputs. If a previously run job is found in the cache, Cromwell will use the results of the previous job instead of re-running it. Cromwell's call cache is maintained in its database. In order for call caching to be used on any previously run jobs,; it is best to configure Cromwell to [point to a MySQL database](../Configuring.md#database) instead of the default; in-memory database. This way any invocation of Cromwell (either with `run` or `server` subcommands) will be able to; utilize results from all calls that are in that database. **Configuring Call Caching**. *Call Caching is disabled by default.* Call Caching can be enabled in your Cromwell; [Configuration](../Configuring.md#call-caching) and the behavior can be modified via; [Workflow Options](../wf_options/Overview.md). If you are adding Workflow options, do not set; [`read_from_cache` or `write_to_cache`](../wf_options/Overview.md#call-caching-options) = false, as it will impact the; following process. Once enabled, Cromwell by default will search the call cache for every `call` statement invocation. * If there was no cache hit, the `call` will be executed as normal. Once finished it will add itself to the cache.; * If there was a cache hit, outputs are either **copied from the original cached job to the new job's output directory**; or **referenced from the original cached job** depending on the Cromwell; [Configuration](../Configuring.md#call-caching) settings. > **Note:** If call caching is enabled, be careful not to change the contents of the output directory for any previously run job. Doing so might cause cache hits in Cromwell to copy over modified data and Cromwell currently does not check that the contents of the output directory changed.

The `/describe` endpoint now differentiates between an invalid workflow and a valid workflow with invalid inputs. Specifically, the new `validWorkflow` key indicates whether the workflow file is valid by itself. If inputs are provided, they are not considered when calculating this field; if inputs are not provided, the value is identical to `valid`. ### Configuration Changes. * Virtual private networks can now be configured. See the section below for details. #### Batch Request Timeouts. The timeout on Cromwell's requests to PAPIv2 can now be configured. See the sample PAPIv2.conf for more documentation:. ```conf; backend {; providers {; PAPIv2 {; config {; batch-requests {; timeouts {; read = 10 seconds; connect = 10 seconds; }; }; }; }; }; }; ```. ### Virtual Private Networks. Cromwell now allows PAPIV2 jobs to run on a private network by adding the network name inside `virtual-private-cloud` in backend configuration.; More info [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/Google/). ### AWS Backend. Now includes background job status polling to hopefully reduce the incidence of 'HTTP 429' errors for large workflows. ## 41 Release Notes. ### Workflow Options. * It is now possible to supply custom `google-labels` in [workflow options](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/wf_options/Google/). ### AWS backend.

This retry option is introduced to provide a method for tackling transient job failures. For example, if a task fails due to a timeout from accessing an external service, then this option helps re-run the failed the task without having to re-run the entire workflow. It takes an Int as a value that indicates the maximum number of times Cromwell should retry a failed task. This retry is applied towards jobs that fail while executing the task command. This method only applies to transient job failures and is a feeble attempt to retry a job, that is it cannot be used to increase memory in out-of-memory situations. If using the Google backend, it's important to note that The `maxRetries` count is independent from the [preemptible](#preemptible) count. For example, the task below can be retried up to 6 times if it's preempted 3 times AND the command execution fails 3 times. ```; runtime {; preemptible: 3; maxRetries: 3; }; ```. ### `continueOnReturnCode`; *Default: _0_*.

Using the previous example, let's imagine **B** failed from a **non-retryable** failure (shaded red). After B failed, **A** fails from a **retryable** failure.

If A is successful then A1 will start (green). ![](CWP_B_fail_A_retryable.png). ## Abort. In both [Run](../Modes/#run) and [Server](../Modes/#server) mode, you can abort a running workflow. This section explains what that entails. When aborting a workflow, either through the `/abort` endpoint or by terminating the [Cromwell run process](../Modes) (if [configured](../Configuring#abort) to do so), Cromwell does the following:. 1. Changes the status of the workflow to `Aborting`,; 2. Does not start any new jobs,; 3. Asks every running job to abort,; 4. Waits for all running jobs to complete,; 5. Finalizes the workflow,; 6. Changes the status of the workflow to `Aborted`. The action of aborting a job is backend specific. Cromwell can only ask a backend to abort a job and wait for the backend to notify it when it is aborted. . For example, if you are running Cromwell on the Google backend and abort a job, Google will send an abort request to the Google Pipelines API. When Pipelines API indicates that the status of the job is aborted, Cromwell will mark it as such.; Remember that abort action is entirely dependent on the backend. In this particular case, Pipelines API does not guarantee the success of an abort request (see [Pipelines API documentation on abort](https://c",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md:3105,abort,aborting,3105,docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,2,['abort'],"['abort', 'aborting']"

This logic is implemented using [Akka Coordinated Shutdown Extension](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/actors.html#coordinated-shutdown). Currently Cromwell is running [version 2.5.4](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.4/scala/actors.html#coordinated-shutdown).; It comes with a set of pre-defined phases, that can be added on and modified. Those phases can be linked together to form a Graph. Cromwell shutdown graphs looks as such:. ![Scaladoc](CromwellShutdownProcess.png). Pre-defined but unused phases have been omitted (cluster related phases for example that are irrelevant in Cromwell). You'll notice the presence of a `PhaseAbortAllWorkflows` phase. This phase is at the same level as the `PhaseServiceRequestsDone` phase which corresponds to our step #3 above.; The reason for a specific abort phase is so that its timeout can be configured differently than the normal shutdown phase. Indeed, stopping all workflows and aborting them is very similar from an outside perspective. We send a message (resp. ""Stop"" and ""Abort"") and wait for a response. In the case where you want to be able to give more time to abort, as it will likely involve more work, you can edit the value of `coordinated-shutdown.phases.abort-all-workflows.timeout` which defaults to 1 hour.; Phases timeouts default to 5 seconds, except the stop-io-activity phase which defaults to 30 minutes. This is because depending on the Database load at the time of the shutdown, it might take a significant amount of time to flush all pending writes. All of the timeouts are configurable in the `akka.coordinated-shutdown.phases` section ([see the latest `reference.conf`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akka/akka/master/akka-actor/src/main/resources/reference.conf)).; To change the default timeout, change the value of `akka.coordinated-shutdown.default-phase-timeout`.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md:8737,abort,aborting,8737,docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,8,"['abort', 'timeout']","['abort', 'abort-all-workflows', 'aborting', 'timeout', 'timeouts']"

The default timeout of 3000 ms (3s) is not enough. So it is set to 120000ms (120s).; * `numThreads = 1`. This will limit the CPU usage of Cromwell, which can be useful in HPC environments. Comparison to MySQL (or PostgreSQL) server:; Advantages:. * No need to set up a server; * No worries about database users, passwords and permissions. This will be handled by filesystem permissions. Disadvantages:. * Cromwell requires more memory; * The database files will consume a lot of disk space (multiple gigabytes are not uncommon); * Cromwell's interaction with the database is slower. Comparison to the default in-memory database:; Advantages:. * Much less memory needed.; * Call-caching enabled. Disadvantages:. * Slower. ### Abort. **Control-C (SIGINT) abort handler**. For backends that support aborting jobs, Cromwell can be configured to automatically try to abort all calls when it receives a Control-C, also known as SIGINT. All currently running calls will also set their status to `Aborted`. To explicitly turn this feature on or off, set the configuration option:. ```hocon; system {; abort-jobs-on-terminate=true; }; ```. Or, via `-Dsystem.abort-jobs-on-terminate=true` command line option. By default, this value is false when running `java -jar cromwell.jar server`, and true when running `java -jar cromwell.jar run <workflow source> <inputs>`. Read the [Abort](execution/ExecutionTwists/#abort) section to learn more about how abort works. ### Call caching. Call Caching allows Cromwell to detect when a job has been run in the past so it doesn't have to re-compute results. ; To learn more see [Call Caching](cromwell_features/CallCaching). To enable Call Caching, add the following to your Cromwell configuration:. ```; call-caching {;",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md:16119,abort,abort,16119,docs/Configuring.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md,1,['abort'],['abort']
Safety,"ch failure mode is enabled. ![](CWP_B_retryable_fail_then_success.png). Using the previous example, let's imagine **B** failed from a **non-retryable** failure (shaded red). After B failed, **A** fails from a **retryable** failure. Now Cromwell's behavior will depend on the failure mode. **`NoNewCalls`** ; If the failure mode is `NoNewCalls`, then A **will not be** retried (yellow). A1 (grey) will not start, because A did not complete. ![](NCC_B_fail_A_retryable.png). **`ContinueWhilePossible`** ; If the failure mode is **`ContinueWhilePossible`**, then A **will be** retried (yellow and green). If A is successful then A1 will start (green). ![](CWP_B_fail_A_retryable.png). ## Abort. In both [Run](../Modes/#run) and [Server](../Modes/#server) mode, you can abort a running workflow. This section explains what that entails. When aborting a workflow, either through the `/abort` endpoint or by terminating the [Cromwell run process](../Modes) (if [configured](../Configuring#abort) to do so), Cromwell does the following:. 1. Changes the status of the workflow to `Aborting`,; 2. Does not start any new jobs,; 3. Asks every running job to abort,; 4. Waits for all running jobs to complete,; 5. Finalizes the workflow,; 6. Changes the status of the workflow to `Aborted`. The action of aborting a job is backend specific. Cromwell can only ask a backend to abort a job and wait for the backend to notify it when it is aborted. . For example, if you are running Cromwell on the Google backend and abort a job, Google will send an abort request to the Google Pipelines API. When Pipelines API indicates that the status of the job is aborted, Cromwell will mark it as such.; Remember that abort action is entirely dependent on the backend. In this particular case, Pipelines API does not guarantee the success of an abort request (see [Pipelines API documentation on abort](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/reference/rest/v1alpha2/operations/cancel)). You'll also notice that the workflow is fin",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md:3250,abort,abort,3250,docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/execution/ExecutionTwists.md,1,['abort'],['abort']

Call caching hashes with this new strategy are based on the path and the last modified time of the file. ### Instance independent abort.

Once the final output has been successfully generated, the checkpoint file will be deleted. To use this feature effectively, the WDL task must be written intentionally to use the checkpoint file. See example below. . ### Effects on cloud charges. Charges will accrue from storing the checkpoint file during the running of the task, and additional charges may apply to the transfer between the VM and the cloud storage bucket depending on their locations. These costs should be minor, especially balanced against the performance and cost benefits of being able to restore from the checkpoint when a worker VM gets preempted. Since the checkpoint file is deleted after successful completion of the task, no further charges will accrue after completion. However, if the task is aborted or otherwise stopped externally, ie through interruption of Cromwell's operation, the checkpoint file will NOT be deleted and storage charges will continue to accrue indefinitely, or until the file is deleted manually. . ### Effect on Call Caching. The presence or absence of the `checkpointFile` attribute is not considered when determining whether to call cache. . ### Example.

On every poll, Cromwell will take at limited number of new submissions, provided there are new workflows to launch and the `system.max-concurrent-workflows` number has not been reached. While the default is to launch up to `1` workflow, you can override this by setting:. ```hocon; system.max-workflow-launch-count = 1; ```. ***Abort configuration***. Cromwell will scan for abort requests using default configuration values equivalent to those below. In most circumstances; there shouldn't be a need to override these defaults. ```hocon; system {; abort {; # How frequently Cromwell should scan for aborts.; scan-frequency: 30 seconds. # The cache of in-progress aborts. Cromwell will add entries to this cache once a WorkflowActor has been messaged to abort.; # If on the next scan an 'Aborting' status is found for a workflow that has an entry in this cache, Cromwell will not ask; # the associated WorkflowActor to abort again.; cache {; # Guava cache concurrency.; concurrency: 1; # How long entries in the cache should live from the time they are added to the cache.; ttl: 20 minutes; # Maximum number of entries in the cache.; size: 100000; }; }; }; ```. ### Database. **Using a MySQL Database**. Cromwell tracks the execution of workflows and stores outputs of task invocations in a SQL database. Cromwell supports either an external MySQL database, or a temporary in-memory database. By default, Cromwell uses an in-memory database which will only live for the duration of the JVM. This provides a quick way to run workflows locally without having to set up MySQL, though it also makes workflow executions somewhat transient. To configure Cromwell to instead point to a MySQL database, first create the empty database. In the example below, the database name is `cromwell`. Then, edit your configuration file `database` stanza, as follow",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md:5261,abort,abort,5261,docs/Configuring.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md,1,['abort'],['abort']

Optional values may also be used by appending `?` to the type:. ```; backend {; providers {; SGE {; config {; # ... other configuration; runtime-attributes = """"""; Float? memory_mb; String? sge_project; """"""; }; }; }; }; ```. The value will be passed to the submit configuration if provided, and omitted otherwise. There are also configuration values related to how jobs are rechecked on startup and aborted. The option is `backend.providers.<backend>.config.run-in-background`. When `true` the backend runs the submit configuration and records the unix process id (PID). To abort the job, the PID is stopped with the unix command `kill`. Upon a cromwell restart, the PID is checked via the unix command `ps` to see if it is still alive, before cromwell goes back to polling for the `rc` file. When `backend.providers.<backend>.config.run-in-background` is `false`, the default, the backend must specify how read the job identifier from the stdout of the submit, how to kill the job, and how to check if the job is still running during a cromwell restart. These three configuration values are `job-id-regex`, `kill`, and `check-alive`, respectively:. ```; backend {; providers {; SGE {; config {; # ... other configuration; job-id-regex = ""(\\d+)""; kill = ""qdel ${job_id}""; check-alive = ""qstat -j ${job_id}""; """"""; }; }; }; }; ```.

When the job finishes submitting, Cromwell will need to retrieve the job id, so that it can abort the job if necessary. This job should be written to the stdout after submission, where Cromwell will then read the job id. Because the job id may be surrounded by other text, a custom regular expression should capture the actual job id. Because the submit above uses `-terse`, the job id will be the entire contents of the stdout, but should be all digits:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; job-id-regex = ""(\\d+)""; }; ```. #### How Cromwell should abort an HPC job. When aborting an HPC job, Cromwell will run a command confifured under the key `kill`, passing in the WDL variable `job_id`:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; kill = ""qdel ${job_id}""; }; ```. #### How Cromwell checks if an HPC job is alive. Whenever Cromwell restarts it checks to see if a job has completed by searching for return code in a file called `rc`. If this file isn't available, in this case Cromwell runs an extra check to make sure the job is still alive. You can configure the command used for this check via:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; check-alive = ""qstat -j ${job_id}""; }; ```. #### Other backend settings. On some systems, the administrators may limit the number of HPC jobs a user may run at a time. To configure this limit, you can use the value `concurrent-job-limit` to limit the number of jobs. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; concurrent-job-limit = 100; }; ```. #### Putting the config section all together.

For backends that support aborting jobs, Cromwell can be configured to automatically try to abort all calls when it receives a Control-C, also known as SIGINT. All currently running calls will also set their status to `Aborted`. To explicitly turn this feature on or off, set the configuration option:. ```hocon; system {; abort-jobs-on-terminate=true; }; ```. Or, via `-Dsystem.abort-jobs-on-terminate=true` command line option. By default, this value is false when running `java -jar cromwell.jar server`, and true when running `java -jar cromwell.jar run <workflow source> <inputs>`.

For example, if you are running Cromwell on the Google backend and abort a job, Google will send an abort request to the Google Pipelines API. When Pipelines API indicates that the status of the job is aborted, Cromwell will mark it as such.; Remember that abort action is entirely dependent on the backend. In this particular case, Pipelines API does not guarantee the success of an abort request (see [Pipelines API documentation on abort](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/reference/rest/v1alpha2/operations/cancel)).

The following explanations of the traits mention multiple types defined in the Cromwell codebase. In particular; `BackendJobDescriptor` wraps all the information necessary for a backend to instantiate a job and `JobKey` provides the; information to uniquely identify a job. It is recommended that one look in the Cromwell codebase for more information on; these and other types. #### BackendWorkflowInitializationActor. If a backend developer wishes to take advantage of the initialization phase of the backend lifecycle they must implement; this trait. There are three functions which must be implemented:. * [`abortInitialization: Unit`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/93392acf2881921dcf22ef4dbda12af42339b3ab/backend/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/BackendWorkflowInitializationActor.scala#L168); specifies what to do, if anything, when a workflow is requested to abort while a backend initialization is in; progress.; * [`validate: Future[Unit]`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/93392acf2881921dcf22ef4dbda12af42339b3ab/backend/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/BackendWorkflowInitializationActor.scala#L178); is provided so that the backend can ensure that all of the calls it will handle conform to the rules of that backend.; For instance, if a backend requires particular runtime attributes to exist.; * [`beforeAll: Future[Option[BackendInitializationData]]`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/93392acf2881921dcf22ef4dbda12af42339b3ab/backend/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/BackendWorkflowInitializationActor.scala#L173); is the actual initialization functionality.

Safety,"on the short queue. Converting this into a template using our runtime attributes requires defining `submit` as one would a WDL task `command`:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; submit = """"""; qsub \; -terse \; -V \; -b y \; -N ${job_name} \; -wd ${cwd} \; -o ${out}.qsub \; -e ${err}.qsub \; -pe smp ${cpu} \; ${""-l mem_free="" + memory_gb + ""g""} \; ${""-q "" + sge_queue} \; ${""-P "" + sge_project} \; /usr/bin/env bash ${script}; """"""; }; ```. When the job finishes submitting, Cromwell will need to retrieve the job id, so that it can abort the job if necessary. This job should be written to the stdout after submission, where Cromwell will then read the job id. Because the job id may be surrounded by other text, a custom regular expression should capture the actual job id. Because the submit above uses `-terse`, the job id will be the entire contents of the stdout, but should be all digits:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; job-id-regex = ""(\\d+)""; }; ```. #### How Cromwell should abort an HPC job. When aborting an HPC job, Cromwell will run a command confifured under the key `kill`, passing in the WDL variable `job_id`:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; kill = ""qdel ${job_id}""; }; ```. #### How Cromwell checks if an HPC job is alive. Whenever Cromwell restarts it checks to see if a job has completed by searching for return code in a file called `rc`. If this file isn't available, in this case Cromwell runs an extra check to make sure the job is still alive.

Sub-workflows are executed in the context of a main workflow, which means that operations that are normally executed once per workflow (set up, clean up, outputs copying, log copying, etc...); will NOT be re-executed for each sub-workflow. For instance if a resource is created during workflow initialization, sub-workflows will need to share this same resource.; Workflow outputs will be copied for the main root workflow but not for intermediate sub-workflows. Restarts, aborts, and call-caching work exactly as they would with tasks. ; All tasks run by a sub-workflow are eligible for call caching under the same rules as any other task.; However, workflows themselves are not cached as such. Which means that running the exact same workflow twice with call caching on will trigger each task to cache individually,; but not the workflow itself. The root path for sub-workflow execution files (scripts, output files, logs) will be under the parent workflow call directory.; For example, the execution directory for the above main workflow would look like the following:. ```; cromwell-executions/main_workflow/1d919bd4-d046-43b0-9918-9964509689dd/ <- main workflow id; └── call-hello_and_goodbye <- call directory for call hello_and_goodbye in the main workflow; └── hello_and_goodbye <- name of the sub-workflow ; └── a6365f91-c807-465a-9186-a5d3da98fe11 <- sub-workflow id; ├── call-goodbye; │ └── execution; │ ├── rc; │ ├── script; │ ├── script.background; │ ├── script.submit; │ ├── stderr; │ ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/SubWorkflows.md:2829,abort,aborts,2829,docs/SubWorkflows.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/SubWorkflows.md,1,['abort'],['aborts']

Beginning in Cromwell 81 we will populate the `tags` field of tasks created by the TES backend; with the labels applied to the workflow at creation time. No guarantee is made about labels; added while the workflow is running. ### Alibaba BCS backend and OSS filesystem removed. The BCS backend and OSS filesystem (both of which support Alibaba Cloud) have been removed. ## 80 Release Notes. ### Direct WES support in Cromwell. Cromwell 80 no longer supports the wes2cromwell project within the Cromwell repository. In the previous release, 3 Wes2Cromwell endpoints in the Cromwell project were implemented and documented in the Swagger API. Three new endpoints,; located within the wes2cromwell project, will also be moved, implemented, and documented within Cromwell. As a result of this, we can safely remove; and deprecate the wes2cromwell project from the repo. Previous endpoints:. | HTTP verb | Endpoint path | Description |; | --------- | ------------- |---------------|; | GET | /api/ga4gh/wes/v1/service-info | Server info |; | POST | /api/ga4gh/wes/v1/runs/{run_id}/cancel | Abort workflow |; | GET | /api/ga4gh/wes/v1/runs/{run_id}/status | Workflow status |.

Like the other; backends, commands scripts are first written to a file, the file is downloaded to the execution; host, and then the localized script is run. Also fixed are AWS `command {}` blocks that use `|` at the start of a line. For example:. ```; command {; echo hello world \; | cat; }; ```. ## 36 Release Notes. ### Extra configuration options.

Coalesce metadata requests to eliminate expensive and redundant queries and metadata construction. #### Eliminate redundant SFS logging and metadata. Eliminate superfluous logging and metadata publishing in the shared filesystem backend on poll intervals where there was not a state change. #### AWS region configuration respected throughout.

Safety,"rces for requests from other hog groups - even if we have jobs waiting to run that could be using them. Here are a few mental models which might be helpful to thinking about the hog factor:. - A hog factor of 2 means that ""2 greedy users would be able to hog the entire resources of Cromwell"" ; - A hog factor of 100 means ""any 1 group is only ever allowed to use 1/100th of the resources of the total Cromwell server"". ### Hog Limit. A Hog Limit is how much of a given resource a hog group is allowed use. Hog limits are not set directly; they are ; values that Cromwell calculates internally.; For example, a single hog group may be limited by Cromwell to a hog limit of 200 jobs per group. Therefore no matter how ; many workflows, sub-workflows, and jobs are queued in a greedy hog group, the whole group is limited to 200 concurrent ; running jobs. ## Configuration. Cromwell accepts the following configuration values for hog factors in the `hog-safety` stanza of `system` in the configuration ; file:; ```conf; system {; hog-safety {; hog-factor = 1; workflow-option = ""hogGroup""; token-log-interval-seconds = 0; }; }; ```. Additionally, you can override system-level hog-factor on a backend level, by setting it in the particular backend configuration like this:; ```conf; backend {; providers {; PAPIv2 {; config {; hog-factor: 2; }; }; }; }; ```. ### Setting a hog-factor. The hog factor option sets the integer described in the [Hog Factor](#hog-factor) section above.; The default value is `1` (which is equivalent to not limiting by hog group). . ### Assignment of hog groups. Within the configuration file, you can specify the workflow option that will determine the hog group. The default is; `hogGroup`. So if a workflow arrives with the following workflow options file, Cromwell will assign `hogGroupA` as the ; workflow's hog group:. ```json; {; ""hogGroup"": ""hogGroupA""; }; ```. - Any workflow option value can be used so long as it is a simple `String` value:; + You can come up wit",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md:2659,safe,safety,2659,docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md,2,['safe'],['safety']

It's possible that if the task is very short that the log file does not flush before de-localization happens and you will end up with a zero byte file. **Google Cloud Storage Filesystem**. On the Google Pipelines backend the GCS (Google Cloud Storage) filesystem is used for the root of the workflow execution.; On the Local, SGE, and associated backends any GCS URI will be downloaded locally. For the Google backend the `jes_gcs_root` [Workflow Option](../wf_options/Google) will take; precedence over the `root` specified at `backend.providers.JES.config.root` in the configuration file. Google Cloud Storage URIs are the only acceptable values for `File` inputs for; workflows using the Google backend. **Pipeline timeout**. Google sets a default pipeline timeout of 7 days, after which the pipeline will abort. Setting `pipeline-timeout` overrides this limit to a maximum of 30 days. ```hocon; backend.providers.PAPIv2.config {; pipeline-timeout: 14 days; }; ```. #### Quota retry. Typically, Life Sciences API is designed to accept all jobs sent to it and respond to quota exhaustion; by queueing jobs internally. However, there are cases when jobs fail instead of queueing, with messages such; as ""PAPI error code 9"", ""no available zones"", and/or ""quota too low"". The following configuration permits Cromwell to detect and retry these failures. Proactively monitoring; and raising quota is still recommended. ```hocon; backend.providers.PAPIv2.config {; # Counts attempts (total jobs) not just retries after to the first; quota-attempts: 20; }; ```. **Enabling FUSE capabilities**. *This is a community contribution and not officially supported by the Cromwell team.*; By default Cromwell task containers doesn't allow to mount any FUSE filesystems. It happens because containers are launched without specific linux capabilities being enabled. ; Google pipelines backend supports running containers with the enabled capabilities and so doe",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/Google.md:11082,timeout,timeout,11082,docs/backends/Google.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/Google.md,1,['timeout'],['timeout']
Safety,"s `rc` file is generated as part of the `script` within the execution directory, where the script is assembled at runtime. This is important as if the script executes successfully but the container doesn't terminate, Cromwell will continue the execution of the workflow and the container will persist hogging system resources. Within the configurations above:; - `singularity`: The exec mode does not run a container on the background. #### Cromwell: Run-in-background. By enabling Cromwell's run-in-background mode, you remove the necessity for the `kill`, `check-alive` and `job-id-regex` blocks, which disables some safety checks when running workflows:. - If there is an error starting the container or executing the script, Cromwell may not recognise this error and hang. For example, this may occur if the container attempts to exceed its allocated resources (runs out of memory); the container daemon may terminate the container without completing the script.; - If you abort the workflow (by attempting to close Cromwell or issuing an abort command), Cromwell does not have a reference to the container execution and will not be able to terminate the container. This is only necessary in local environments where there is no job manager to control this, however if your container technology can emit an identifier to stdout, then you are able to remove the run-in-background flag. . ### Next Steps.

Call caching hashes with this new strategy are based on the path and the last modified time of the file. ### Instance independent abort. For multi-instance Cromwell deployments sharing a single database, earlier versions of Cromwell required abort; requests to be sent specifically to the instance that was running the targeted workflow. Cromwell 37 now; allows abort commands to be sent to any Cromwell instance in the shared-database deployment. Configuration details; [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/Configuring/abort-configuration). ### Call cache blacklisting.

For example, if you are running Cromwell on the Google backend and abort a job, Google will send an abort request to the Google Pipelines API.

Task was preempted for the 2nd time.; ```; Cromwell 44 introduced special handling that detects both preemption indicators and re-runs the job consistent with the `preemptible` setting. Cromwell 46 enhances this handling in response to user reports of possible continued issues. ## 45 Release Notes. ### Improved input and output transfer performance on PAPI v2. Cromwell now requires only a single PAPI ""action"" each for the entire localization or delocalization process, rather than two per file or directory.; This greatly increases execution speed for jobs with large numbers of input or output files.; In testing, total execution time for a call with 800 inputs improved from more than 70 minutes to less than 20 minutes. ### List dependencies flag in Womtool Command Line [(#5098)](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/5098).

By default the Cromwell server will bind to `0.0.0.0` on port `8000`. ; You can then access it through a browser at `http://localhost:8000`. ; To change these settings, simply edit the following values in your configuration file:. ```; webservice {; port = 9000; interface = 0.0.0.0; }; ```. The above configuration will use port `9000`. Cromwell uses `akka-http` to serve requests. For more advanced configuration settings, refer to the [akka-http](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/configuration.html) documentation. For example, to increase the request timeout to 30 seconds you can add this stanza to your configuration file:. ```; akka.http.server.request-timeout = 30s; ```. ### I/O. **I/O Throttling**. Certain [backends](backends/Backends) impose I/O limits. For example the Pipelines API imposes a quota on the number of queries that can be made per second. You can effectively control and throttle the number of requests and resources allocated to those operations in the `system.io` configuration:. ```; system.io {; number-of-requests = 100000; per = 100 seconds; }; ```. **I/O Resilience**. I/O operations can fail for a number of reason from network failures to server errors. Some of those errors are not fatal and can be retried. Cromwell will retry I/O operations on such retryable errors, for a limited number of times before giving up and failing. This number (more precisely the number of attempts that will be made) can be set using the following configuration option:. ```; system.io {; number-of-attempts = 5; }; ```. ### Workflows. **Max Concurrent Workflows**.

These three actors are all represented by a trait which a backend developer would need to implement. Both the; initialization and finalization actors are optional. The following explanations of the traits mention multiple types defined in the Cromwell codebase. In particular; `BackendJobDescriptor` wraps all the information necessary for a backend to instantiate a job and `JobKey` provides the; information to uniquely identify a job. It is recommended that one look in the Cromwell codebase for more information on; these and other types. #### BackendWorkflowInitializationActor. If a backend developer wishes to take advantage of the initialization phase of the backend lifecycle they must implement; this trait. There are three functions which must be implemented:. * [`abortInitialization: Unit`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/93392acf2881921dcf22ef4dbda12af42339b3ab/backend/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/BackendWorkflowInitializationActor.scala#L168); specifies what to do, if anything, when a workflow is requested to abort while a backend initialization is in; progress.; * [`validate: Future[Unit]`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/93392acf2881921dcf22ef4dbda12af42339b3ab/backend/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/BackendWorkflowInitializationActor.scala#L178); is provided so that the backend can ensure that all of the calls it will handle conform to the rules of that backend.; For instance, if a backend requires particular runtime attributes to exist.; * [`beforeAll: Future[Option[BackendInitializationData]]`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/93392acf2881921dcf22ef4dbda12af42339b3ab/backend/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/BackendWorkflowInitializationActor.scala#L173); is the actual initialization functionality.

You can find the `sha256` of an image using `docker images --digests`; ; ; ### Notes. #### How does Cromwell know when a job or container has completed?; Cromwell uses the presence of the `rc` (returncode) file to determine whether a task has succeeded or failed. This `rc` file is generated as part of the `script` within the execution directory, where the script is assembled at runtime. This is important as if the script executes successfully but the container doesn't terminate, Cromwell will continue the execution of the workflow and the container will persist hogging system resources. Within the configurations above:; - `singularity`: The exec mode does not run a container on the background. #### Cromwell: Run-in-background. By enabling Cromwell's run-in-background mode, you remove the necessity for the `kill`, `check-alive` and `job-id-regex` blocks, which disables some safety checks when running workflows:. - If there is an error starting the container or executing the script, Cromwell may not recognise this error and hang. For example, this may occur if the container attempts to exceed its allocated resources (runs out of memory); the container daemon may terminate the container without completing the script.; - If you abort the workflow (by attempting to close Cromwell or issuing an abort command), Cromwell does not have a reference to the container execution and will not be able to terminate the container. This is only necessary in local environments where there is no job manager to control this, however if your container technology can emit an identifier to stdout, then you are able to remove the run-in-background flag. . ### Next Steps.

The `/describe` endpoint now differentiates between an invalid workflow and a valid workflow with invalid inputs. Specifically, the new `validWorkflow` key indicates whether the workflow file is valid by itself. If inputs are provided, they are not considered when calculating this field; if inputs are not provided, the value is identical to `valid`. ### Configuration Changes. * Virtual private networks can now be configured.

Call caching hashes with this new strategy are based on the path and the last modified time of the file. ### Instance independent abort. For multi-instance Cromwell deployments sharing a single database, earlier versions of Cromwell required abort; requests to be sent specifically to the instance that was running the targeted workflow.

All actors generating data that needs to be persisted receive a message asking them to gracefully stop.; This means that they are given some time (see below for how much and how to change it) to return to a known ""consistent"" state.; For example, an actor waiting for a response from the database before sending information to the metadata will wait for that response before shutting itself down.; 4. All active connections from the REST endpoints are completed and closed. At this point any client that made a request before the shutdown process started should have received a response.; 5. All actors responsible for data persistence are in turn being asked to gracefully shutdown. ; For example, all queued up metadata writes are executed.; 6. Database connection pools are shutdown.; 7. Actor system shuts down.; 8. JVM exits.; ; This multi-stage process is designed to minimize the risk of data loss during shutdown. However in order to prevent this process from lasting forever, each stage (called phase) has its own timeout.; If the phase does not complete within the given timeout, actors will be forcefully stopped and the next phase will start. This logic is implemented using [Akka Coordinated Shutdown Extension](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/actors.html#coordinated-shutdown). Currently Cromwell is running [version 2.5.4](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.4/scala/actors.html#coordinated-shutdown).; It comes with a set of pre-defined phases, that can be added on and modified.

The response for a request timeout will now be plain text, rather than a JSON format. * **Metadata endpoint**; The response from the metadata endpoint can be quite large depending on your workflow. You can now opt-in to have Cromwell gzip your metadata file, in order to reduce file size, by sending the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header. The default behavior now does not gzip encode responses. * **Engine endpoints**; Previously the engine endpoints were available under `/api/engine` but now the endpoints are under `/engine` so they don't require authentication. Workflow endpoints are still available under `/api/workflows`. We also deprecated the setting `api.routeUnwrapped` as a part of this internal consistency effort. * **Call caching diff**; We updated the response format of the [callcaching/diff](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell#get-apiworkflowsversioncallcachingdiff) endpoint. ### Other ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:81850,timeout,timeouts,81850,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,2,['timeout'],['timeouts']

Read the [Abort](execution/ExecutionTwists/#abort) section to learn more about how abort works. ### Call caching. Call Caching allows Cromwell to detect when a job has been run in the past so it doesn't have to re-compute results. ; To learn more see [Call Caching](cromwell_features/CallCaching). To enable Call Caching, add the following to your Cromwell configuration:. ```; call-caching {; enabled = true; invalidate-bad-cache-results = true; }; ```. When `call-caching.enabled=true` (default: `false`), Cromwell will be able to to reference or copy results from previously run jobs (when appropriate).; When `invalidate-bad-cache-results=true` (default: `true`), Cromwell will invalidate any cache results which contain files that cannot be accessed within a cache-hit. This is usually desired, but might be unwanted if this failure occurs for external reasons, such as a difference in user authentication. Cromwell also accepts [Workflow Options](wf_options/Overview#call-caching-options) to override the cache read/write behavior. . ### Local filesystem options.

This section offers detailed configuration instructions for using Cromwell with the Google Cloud Batch in all supported; authentication modes. Before reading further in this section please see the; [Getting started on Google Cloud Batch](../tutorials/Batch101) for instructions common to all authentication modes; and detailed instructions for the application default authentication scheme in particular.; The instructions below assume you have created a Google Cloud Storage bucket and a Google project enabled for the appropriate APIs. *NOTE*: Google Cloud Batch is still in alpha version, this means that there could be breaking changes, be sure to review the [GCP Batch CHANGELOG](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#gcp-batch) carefully before upgrading. **Configuring Authentication**. The `google` stanza in the Cromwell configuration file defines how to authenticate to Google. There are four different; authentication schemes that might be used:. * `application_default` (default, recommended) - Use [application default](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials) credentials.; * `service_account` - Use a specific service account and key file (in PEM format) to authenticate.; * `user_account` - Authenticate as a user.; * `user_service_account` - Authenticate each individual workflow using service account credentials supplied in the workflow options. The `auths` block in the `google` stanza defines the authentication schemes within a Cromwell deployment:. ```hocon; google {; application-name = ""cromwell""; auths = [; {; name = ""application-default""; scheme = ""application_default""; },; {; name = ""service-account""; scheme = ""service_account""; service-account-id = ""my-service-account""; pem-file = ""/path/to/file.pem""; },; {; name = ""user-service-account""; scheme = ""user_service_acc",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/GCPBatch.md:1196,authenticat,authenticate,1196,docs/backends/GCPBatch.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/GCPBatch.md,1,['authenticat'],['authenticate']
Security," Config (Shared Filesystem) backend now supports invocation of commands which run in a Docker image as a non-root user.; The non-root user could either be the default user for a given Docker image (e.g. specified in a Dockerfile via a `USER` directive),; or the Config backend could pass an optional `""-u username""` as part of the `submit-docker` command.; * In some cases the SFS backend, used for Local, SGE, etc., coerced `WdlFile` to `WdlString` by using `.toUri`.

Security," Cromwell server. Using Apache `httpd` web server for example with basic `htpassword` file-based authentication, the configuration might look something like:. ```Apache; <Location /cromwell>; Order deny,allow; Allow from all; AuthType Basic; AuthName ""Password Required""; AuthUserFile /path/to/my/htpasswdfile; Require user someone someoneelse; ProxyPass http://101.101.234.567:8000 # address of cromwell server web service; </Location>; ```. Users now hit `http://my.proxy.org/cromwell` with authenticated requests, and they're forwarded to port 8000 on the Cromwell server host. . **Multiple Servers on one Host**. The above scheme extends easily to multiple Cromwell instances, for use by different groups within an organization, for example. If multiple instances are running on the same host, then each instance should be run as its own dedicated user (such as service account when using a [Google Cloud backend](backends/Google)), e.g. `cromwell1`, `cromwell2` etc so that processes running under one Cromwell instance cannot access the files of another. Different webservice ports must also be configured separately in order to not clash. If persistent database storage is being used, then each instance must be configured with its own database. The proxy configuration above is extended simply by adding another `Location`:. ```Apache; <Location /cromwell1>; Order deny,allow; Allow from all; AuthType Basic; AuthName ""Password Required""; AuthUserFile /path/to/my/htpasswdfile1; Require user stillanotherperson andanother; ProxyPass http://101.101.234.567:8001; </Location>; ```. **Multiple Tenants in one Cromwell Server**. Even with a proxy in place, a single Cromwell server does not provide _authorization_ for individual users hitting the endpoints.

Please check the [README](README.md#label-format) for more detailed documentation.; * Custom labels won't be submitted to Google backend as they are now decoupled from Google's default labels.; * Cromwell now publishes the labels as soon as the workflow is submitted (whether started or on hold). If the labels are invalid, the workflow will not be submitted and request will fail. ### Scala 2.11 Removed; From version 32 onwards we will no longer be publishing build artifacts compatible with Scala 2.11. * If you don't import the classes into your own scala project then this should have no impact on you.; * If you **are** importing the classes into your own scala project, make sure you are using Scala 2.12. ### Input Validation; Cromwell can now validate that your inputs files do not supply inputs with no impact on the workflow. Strict validation will be disabled by default in WDL draft 2 and CWL but enabled in WDL draft 3. See the 'Language Factory Config' below for details. ### Language Factory Config; All language factories can now be configured on a per-language-version basis.

Set to `false` to disallow workflows of this language and version.; * `strict-validation`: Defaults to `true` for WDL draft 3 and `false` for WDL draft 2 and CWL. Specifies whether workflows fail if the inputs JSON (or YAML) file contains values which the workflow did not ask for (and will therefore have no effect). Additional strict checks may be added in the future. ### API. * More accurately returns 503 instead of 500 when Cromwell can not respond in a timely manner; * Cromwell now allows a user to submit a workflow but in a state where it will not automatically be picked up for execution.

For example, the task below will succeed:; ```; command {; echo ""hello!""; ; }. runtime {; docker: ""gcr.io/gcp-runtimes/ubuntu_16_0_4:latest""; noAddress: true; }; ```.

To continue without an HTTP filesystem, you can add the; following content into the appropriate stanza of your configuration file:; ```; engine {; filesystems {; http {; enabled: false; }; }; }; ```; - When the value `exit-code-timeout-seconds` is set, `check-alive` command is now only called once every timeout interval instead of each poll. ### Beta preview of new Womtool `/describe` endpoint. This new endpoint brings the functionality of Womtool to the world of web services. Submit workflows for validation and receive a JSON description in response. The endpoint is still undergoing heavy development and should not be used in production. The final version will ship in a future release of Cromwell; watch this space. ### Bug fixes. - Fixed a regression in Cromwell 36 that could cause operations on empty arrays to fail with a spurious type error (closes [#4318](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4318)). #### Abort On Hold Workflows. On Hold workflows may now be aborted. #### Command fixes for AWS and TES. The AWS and TES backends can now handle calls that generate longer command lines. Like the other; backends, commands scripts are first written to a file, the file is downloaded to the execution; host, and then the localized script is run. Also fixed are AWS `command {}` blocks that use `|` at the start of a line. For example:. ```; command {; echo hello world \; | cat; }; ```. ## 36 Release Notes. ### Extra configuration options.

However note that some interpolated variables (`${stdout}`, `${stderr}`) are different between these two blocks. #### Docker Digests. Each Docker repository has a number of tags that can be used to refer to the latest image of a particular type. ; For instance, when you run a normal Docker image with `docker run image`, it will actually run `image:latest`, the `latest` tag of that image. However, by default Cromwell requests and runs images using their `sha` hash, rather than using tags.; This strategy is actually preferable, because it ensures every execution of the task or workflow will use the exact same version of the image, but some engines such as `udocker` don't support this feature. If you are using `udocker` or want to disable the use of hash-based image references, you can set the following config option:; ```; docker.hash-lookup.enabled = false; ```. Nb: By disabling hash-lookup, call caching will not work for any container using a floating tag. #### Docker Root; If you want to change the root directory inside your containers, where the task places input and output files, you can edit the following option:. ```; backend {; providers {; LocalExample {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; ; # Root directory where Cromwell writes job results in the container.

Using Apache `httpd` web server for example with basic `htpassword` file-based authentication, the configuration might look something like:. ```Apache; <Location /cromwell>; Order deny,allow; Allow from all; AuthType Basic; AuthName ""Password Required""; AuthUserFile /path/to/my/htpasswdfile; Require user someone someoneelse; ProxyPass http://101.101.234.567:8000 # address of cromwell server web service; </Location>; ```. Users now hit `http://my.proxy.org/cromwell` with authenticated requests, and they're forwarded to port 8000 on the Cromwell server host. . **Multiple Servers on one Host**. The above scheme extends easily to multiple Cromwell instances, for use by different groups within an organization, for example. If multiple instances are running on the same host, then each instance should be run as its own dedicated user (such as service account when using a [Google Cloud backend](backends/Google)), e.g. `cromwell1`, `cromwell2` etc so that processes running under one Cromwell instance cannot access the files of another. Different webservice ports must also be configured separately in order to not clash. If persistent database storage is being used, then each instance must be configured with its own database. The proxy configuration above is extended simply by adding another `Location`:. ```Apache; <Location /cromwell1>; Order deny,allow; Allow from all; AuthType Basic; AuthName ""Password Required""; AuthUserFile /path/to/my/htpasswdfile1; Require user stillanotherperson andanoth",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/Security.md:1881,authenticat,authenticated,1881,docs/developers/Security.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/Security.md,1,['authenticat'],['authenticated']

Using this option does not alter your database's underlying timezone; rather, it causes Cromwell to ""speak UTC"" when communicating with the DB, and the DB server performs the conversion for you. . **Using Cromwell with Postgresql**. To use Postgresql as the database, you will need to install and enable the; Large Object extension. If the extension is present, setting up the database; requires just these commands:. ```; $ createdb cromwell; $ psql -d cromwell -c ""create extension lo;""; ```.

And once the marker is complete, the gather key for the output also becomes runnable.

To run Singularity on a job scheduler, the singularity command needs to be passed to the scheduler as a wrapped command. For example, in SLURM, we can use the normal SLURM configuration as explained in the [SLURM documentation](../backends/SLURM), however we'll add a `submit-docker` block to execute when a task is tagged with a docker container. . When constructing this block, there are a few things to keep in mind:; - Make sure Singularity is loaded (and in PATH). If `module` is installed for ; example you can call `module load Singularity`. If the cluster admin has made; a Singularity module available. Alternatively you can alter the `PATH` ; variable directly or simply use `/path/to/singularity` ; directly in the config.; - We should treat worker nodes as if they do not have stable access to the ; internet or build access, so we will pull the container before the task is ; submit to the cluster.; - It's a good idea to use a Singularity cache so that same images should only; have to be pulled once. Make sure you set the `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` ; environment variable to a location on the filesystem that is reachable by the; worker nodes!; - If we are using a cache we need to ensure that submit processes started by; Cromwell do not pull to the same cache at the same time. This may corrupt the; cache. We can prevent this by implementing a filelock with `flock` and ; pulling the image before the job is submitted. The flock and pull command ; needs to be placed *before* the submit command so all pull commands are ; executed on the same node. This is necessary for the filelock to work.; - As mentioned above the `--containall` flag is **important** for ; reproducibility. ```; submit-docker = """"""; # Make sure the SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR variable is set.

Most importantly, the value of the `client_email` field should go into the `service-account-id` field in the configuration (see below). The; `private_key` portion needs to be pulled into its own file (e.g. `my-key.pem`). The `\n`s in the string need to be converted to newline characters. While technically not part of Service Account authentication mode, one can also override the default service account that the compute VM is started with via the configuration option `JES.config.genomics.compute-service-account` or through the workflow options parameter `google_compute_service_account`. The service account you provide must have been granted Service Account Actor role to Cromwell's primary service account. As this only affects Google Pipelines API and not GCS, it's important that this service account, and the service account specified in `JES.config.genomics.auth` can both read/write the location specified by `JES.config.root`. **User Service Account**.

This page provides run-throughs to give insight into how the; [Execution Store](executionStore.md) and [Value Store](valueStore.md) work in; practice in some example situations. . ## Handling a single task call. To begin, consider this simple workflow. It has a single task call whose; result is exposed as an output String:. ```wdl; version 1.0. workflow single_task_workflow {; call single_task; ; output {; String string_out = single_task.string_out; }; }. task single_task {; command {; echo hello; }; output {; String string_out = ""hello""; }; }; ```. The **Execution Store** will keep track of statuses as the workflow runs:. | | `single_task` | `string_out` |; |---|---|---|; |1|`NotStarted`|`NotStarted`|; |2|`QueuedInCromwell`|`NotStarted`|; |3|`Starting`|`NotStarted`|; |4|`Running`|`NotStarted`|; |5|`Done`|`NotStarted`|; |6|`Done`|`Running`|; |7|`Done`|`Done`|. In step 1, the workflow has just started and the ExecutionStore is created in its initial; state. The Value Store doesn't track statuses and so begins empty: `{ }`. In steps 2-4, the Execution Store tracks the `single_task` job as the engine is executing it. As the Execution Store is updated to indicate task completion is step 5, the Value Store is also updated to; include the output value of the task:; ```json; {; ""single_task.string_out"": ""hello""; }; ```. By step 6, Cromwell can use the fact that the task is complete to decide that the output node is ready to be; evaluated. And the input to the output expression is available for lookup in the Value Store. In step 7, all workflow nodes have run and the workflow is complete. The Value Store is updated once again to; additionally contain the output node value:; ```json; {; ""single_task.string_out"": ""hello"",; ""string_out"": ""hello""; }; ``` .

To provide a concrete example, we will see how Cromwell parses the following line of WDL into WDLOM:. ```wdl; Int foo = min(100, max(1,2)); ``` . #### How Hermes interprets the WDL. Hermes can be asked to show its parse tree for a valid WDL file by running:. ```bash; $ hermes analyze grammar.hgr <WDL FILE>; ```.

In graphical form this is (with string hashes replaced by values, for convenience):. ![Hermes AST Graph](wdlToWdlom_hermes.svg). #### How WDLOM represents WDL. WDLOM tries to be a programmer-friendlier, WDL version agnostic data model to hold WDL syntax trees.

Relating back to the [WDL parsing](../workflowParsing/wdlParsingOverview.md) process:. * WDL 1.0 engine functions become contextless WDLOM `ExpressionElement`s during the transliteration phase; * Reference resolution between WDLOM elements occurs during the linking phase. ; * WDLOM `ExpressionElement`s are wrapped into `WdlomWomExpression`s during the graph building phase. During the graph construction phase static expression elements are mixed together with evaluation functions; to produce the final WOM expressions, and any differences between language versions are baked in. . #### Where evaluation functions are coded. The four evaluators types described in ""Expressions in WOM"" are coded in four package objects for each version.

Amazon's S3 storage is a supported filesystem in both the engine and backend, this means that S3 files can be referenced at a workflow level, and as input files, provided they are prefixed by `'s3://'`. * filesystems; * filesystems.s3.auth; * filesystems.s3.caching.duplication-strategy. ### Configuring Authentication. To allow Cromwell to talk to AWS, the `default` authentication scheme uses the [default authentication provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html) with the following AWS search paths:; - Environment Variables - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`; - Java system properties - `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretKey`; - Default credential profiles file - Created by the AWS CLI, typically located at `~/.aws/credentials`; - _Instance profile credentials_ - Only relevant on EC2 instances. ### Allowing private Docker containers. AWS Batch allows the use of private Docker containers by providing `dockerhub` credentials. Under the specific backend's configuration, you can provide the following object:. ```hocon; (backend.providers.AWSBatch.config.)dockerhub = {; // account = """"; // token = """"; }; ```. ### More configuration options. * `(backend.providers.AWSBatch.config.)concurrent-job-limit` specifies the number of jobs that Cromwell will allow to be running in AWS at the same time.

For information on supported conversions, refer to the [TES documentation](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/TES/). ### Bug Fixes. * Reference disks are only mounted if configured in the workflow options. * Recent docker images of Ubuntu use a new manifest format, ensure that these newer image versions can be pulled from Docker Registry without issue. * When converting ValueStore objects to strings for logging, we truncate long values to limit memory usage. ### Security Patching. Updates to dependencies to fix security vulnerabilities. ## 84 Release Notes. ### CromIAM enabled user checks. For Cromwell instances utilizing the optional CromIAM identity and access management component, the following endpoints now verify that the calling user is enabled before forwarding the request.; * `/api/workflows/v1/backends`; * `/api/womtool/v1/describe`. This change makes the above endpoints consistent with the existing behavior of all the other endpoints in the `/api/` path of CromIAM. ## 83 Release Notes. * Changes the type of several primary key columns in call caching tables from int to bigint. The database migration may be lengthy if your database contains a large amount of call caching data. ## 82 Release Notes. * Restored missing example configuration file; * Upgraded to latest version of the Google Cloud Storage NIO library (0.124.8); * Cromwell will now finitely retry the following Google Cloud Storage I/O error.; * Response code `400` bad request, message `User project specified in the request is invalid`; * The default retry count is `5` and may be customized with `system.io.number-of-attempts`. ## 81 Release Notes. ### Workflow labels in TES tasks.

Security,"**Warning!**. - Cromwell is NOT on its own a security appliance!; - Only YOU are responsible for your own security! ; - Please be sure to check with your security team before setting up your Cromwell server; - Some recommendations and suggestions on security can be found below. __This is intended as helpful guidance only, and is not endorsed by the Broad Institute.__. Cromwell running in server mode accepts all connections on the configured webservice port. Without taking additional measures to protect your Cromwell server, this can leave your Cromwell server and therefore all information stored by and accessible by your Cromwell server vulnerable to anyone who is able to access the server. For instance, an unprotected Cromwell server running against the [Google Cloud backend](backends/Google) would leave you vulnerable to outside users running workflows that will cost you money, and potentially access the data files you use within your workflows!. The simplest way to restrict access is by putting an authenticating proxy server in between users and the Cromwell server: . 1. Configure a firewall rule on the Cromwell server host to deny access to the webservice port (e.g. 8000) from all addresses except a secure proxy host. ; 2. Configure `<YourFavoriteWebProxy>` on the proxy host with `<YourFavoriteAuthMechanism>`, to proxy authenticated traffic from the world to the Cromwell server. Using Apache `httpd` web server for example with basic `htpassword` file-based authentication, the configuration might look something like:. ```Apache; <Location /cromwell>; Order deny,allow; Allow from all; AuthType Basic; AuthName ""Password Required""; AuthUserFile /path/to/my/htpasswdfile; Require user someone someoneelse; ProxyPass http://101.101.234.567:8000 # address of cromwell server web service; </Location>; ```.

The development team accepts reproducible bug reports from self-managed instances, but cannot feasibly provide direct support. [Cromwell's backends](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/Backends/) receive development resources proportional to user demand. The team is actively developing for Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure (see [Cromwell on Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure)). Maintenance of other backends is primarily community-based. Cromwell [supports](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/LanguageSupport/) the WDL workflow language. Cromwell version 80 and above no longer support CWL. CWL will be re-introduced at a later date in the [Terra platform](https://terra.bio/), using a solution other than Cromwell.

[udocker](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker) is a tool designed to ""execute simple docker containers in user space without requiring root privileges"". In essence, udocker provides a command line interface that mimics `docker`, and implements the commands using one of four different container backends:. * PRoot; * Fakechroot; * runC; * Singularity. #### Installation; udocker can be installed without any kind of root permissions. Refer to udocker's installation documentation [here](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/blob/master/doc/installation_manual.md) for more information. #### Configuration. (As of [2019-02-18](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/issues/112)) udocker does not support looking up docker container by digests, hence you'll have to make ensure `hash-lookup` is disabled. Refer to [this section](#docker-digests) for more detail. To configure `udocker` to work in a local environment, you must tag the provider's configuration to `run-in-background` and update the `submit-docker` to use udocker:; ```; run-in-background = true; submit-docker = """"""; udocker run -v ${cwd}:${docker_cwd} ${docker} ${job_shell} ${docker_script}; """"""; ```. With a job queue like SLURM, you just need to wrap this script in an `sbatch` submission like we did with Singularity:. ```; submit-docker = """"""; # Pull the image using the head node, in case our workers don't have network access; udocker pull ${docker}; ; sbatch \; -J ${job_name} \; -D ${cwd} \; -o ${cwd}/execution/stdout \; -e ${cwd}/execution/stderr \; -t ${runtime_minutes} \; ${""-c "" + cpus} \; --mem-per-cpu=${requested_memory_mb_per_core} \; --wrap ""udocker run -v ${cwd}:${docker_cwd} ${docker} ${job_shell} ${docker_script}""; """"""; ```. #### Cac",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md:14845,hash,hash-lookup,14845,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md,2,['hash'],['hash-lookup']

Memory, CPU and docker will always have their default cache-consideration behavior.; * Note: Unlike memory, cpu and docker attributes which inherit validation and hash-lookup behavior, any custom attributes will be simple primitive comparisons.; * For example, a `docker` attribute will be cached by looking up docker hashes against a docker repository, but a custom `singularity` attribute would be a primitive string match. #### How Cromwell should start an HPC job. When Cromwell runs a task, it will fill in a template for the job using the declared runtime attributes. This specific template will vary depending on the requirements of your HPC cluster. For example, say you normally submit jobs to SGE using:. ```bash; qsub -terse -V -b y -N my_job_name \; -wd /path/to/working_directory \; -o /path/to/stdout.qsub \; -e /path/to/stderr.qsub \; -pe smp 1 -l mem_free=0.5g -q short \; /usr/bin/env bash myScript.bash; ```.

The output of this script will be written to a `monitoring.log` file that will be available in the call gcs bucket when the call completes.

Security,"AWS Batch Backend Architecture; ==============================. Overview; --------. The architecture of the code base follows very closely to the Google version.; Probably a little too closely, and lots of code was lifted from the Google; backend originally, then modified to work with AWS. Fundamentally, Google Pipelines API (a.k.a. PAPI) works pretty differently from; AWS Batch. In Pipelines, all the infrastructure is completely managed by Google,; while AWS Batch exposes that infrastructure to a large degree so that customers; can fine tune it as necessary. An implementation that uses Fargate might be an ; alternative that is closer or an implementation that uses Step Functions although; that would be a separate backend. From a Cromwell perspective, this means that unlike Pipelines, where; infrastructure details are defined in the configuration or the WDL, in AWS; Batch, these configuration details are handled outside. All the AWS Batch; backend needs to know is ""what is the ARN for the job Queue""?. A good example of the difference can be seen in the 'disks' configuration. In; Pipelines, you need to specify the type of disk and size. In AWS, this will; be defined instead when you setup your environment (more on that later), so; all the AWS backend really needs to know is what mount points you need; defined. This infrastructure and all the associated configuration still exists; however,; it is moved out of the Cromwell configuration. AWS Batch; ---------. Because AWS Batch is so different from PAPI, those familiar only with PAPI; would be best off with an overview of AWS Batch. If you are familiar with; the workings of Batch, feel free to skip this section, and move on. [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) fundamentally is a service to allow batch jobs to run easily and; efficiently. To use it effectively, however, you need to understand its own; technical stack. To create a job, you need a ""Job Queue"".

Security,"Cromwell provides a generic way to configure a backend relying on most High Performance Computing (HPC) frameworks, and with access to a shared filesystem. The two main features that are needed for this backend to be used are a way to submit a job to the compute cluster and to get its status through the command line.; You can find example configurations for a variety of those backends here:. * [SGE](SGE); * [LSF](LSF); * [SLURM](SLURM); * [HTCondor](HTcondor). ## FileSystems. ### Shared FileSystem; HPC backends rely on being able to access and use a shared filesystem to store workflow results. Cromwell is configured with a root execution directory which is set in the configuration file under `backend.providers.<backend_name>.config.root`. This is called the `cromwell_root` and it is set to `./cromwell-executions` by default. Relative paths are interpreted as relative to the current working directory of the Cromwell process. When Cromwell runs a workflow, it first creates a directory `<cromwell_root>/<workflow_uuid>`. This is called the `workflow_root` and it is the root directory for all activity in this workflow. Each `call` has its own subdirectory located at `<workflow_root>/call-<call_name>`. This is the `<call_dir>`.; Any input files to a call need to be localized into the `<call_dir>/inputs` directory. There are different localization strategies that Cromwell will try until one works:. * `hard-link` - This will create a hard link to the file; * `soft-link` - Create a symbolic link to the file. This strategy is not enabled by default for tasks which specify a ; Docker image and will be ignored.; * `copy` - Make a copy the file; * `cached-copy` An experimental feature.

The `google` stanza in the Cromwell configuration file defines how to authenticate to Google. There are four different; authentication schemes that might be used:. * `application_default` (default, recommended) - Use [application default](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials) credentials.; * `service_account` - Use a specific service account and key file (in PEM format) to authenticate.; * `user_account` - Authenticate as a user.; * `user_service_account` - Authenticate each individual workflow using service account credentials supplied in the workflow options. The `auths` block in the `google` stanza defines the authentication schemes within a Cromwell deployment:. ```hocon; google {; application-name = ""cromwell""; auths = [; {; name = ""application-default""; scheme = ""application_default""; },; {; name = ""service-account""; scheme = ""service_account""; service-account-id = ""my-service-account""; pem-file = ""/path/to/file.pem""; },; {; name = ""user-service-account""; scheme = ""user_service_account""; }; ]; }; ```. These authentication schemes can be referenced by name within other portions of the configuration file. For example, both; the `GCPBATCH` and `filesystems.gcs` sections within a Google configuration block must reference an auth defined in this block.; The auth for the `GCPBATCH` section governs the interactions with Google itself, while `filesystems.gcs` governs the localization; of data into and out of GCE VMs. **Application Default Credentials**.

Security,"Mac or Windows from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community). #### Docker on Cloud. It is strongly advised that you provide a Docker image to tasks that will run on Cloud backends, and in fact most Cloud providers require it. It might be possible to use an alternative container engine, but this is not recommended if Docker is supported. #### Docker on HPC. Docker can allow running users to gain superuser privileges, called the [Docker daemon attack surface](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface). In HPC and multi-user environments, Docker recommends that ""only trusted users should be allowed to control your Docker Daemon"". For this reason, this tutorial will also explore other technologies that support the reproducibility and simplicity of running a workflow that use docker containers; Singularity and udocker. ___. ### Singularity. Singularity is a container technology designed for use on HPC systems in particular, while ensuring an appropriate level of security that Docker cannot provide. #### Installation; Before you can configure Cromwell on your HPC system, you will have to install Singularity, which is documented [here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/admin-guide/admin_quickstart.html#installation).; In order to gain access to the full set of features in Singularity, it is strongly recommended that Singularity is installed by root, with the `setuid` bit enabled, as is ([documented here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/2.6/admin-guide/security.html#how-does-singularity-do-it)).; This likely means that you will have to ask your sysadmin to install it for you.; Because `singularity` ideally needs `setuid`, your admins may have some qualms about giving Singularity this privilege.; If that is the case, you might consider forwarding [this letter](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html#singularity-on-a-shared-resource) to your admins.

Cromwell now supports call caching with floating Docker tags (e.g. `docker: ""ubuntu:latest""`). Note it is still considered; a best practice to specify Docker images as hashes where possible, especially for production usages. Within a single workflow Cromwell will attempt to resolve all floating tags to the same Docker hash, even if Cromwell is restarted; during the execution of a workflow. In call metadata the `docker` runtime attribute is now the same as the; value that actually appeared in the WDL:. ```; ""runtimeAttributes"": {; ""docker"": ""ubuntu:latest"",; ""failOnStderr"": ""false"",; ""continueOnReturnCode"": ""0""; }; ```.

Two methods are available.; ""local"" will try to look for the image on the machine where cromwell is running. If it can't be found, Cromwell will try to `pull` the image and use the hash from the retrieved image.; ""remote"" will try to look up the image hash directly on the remote repository where the image is located (Docker Hub and GCR are supported); Note that the ""local"" option will require docker to be installed on the machine running cromwell, in order for it to call the docker CLI.; * Adds hash lookup support for public [quay.io](https://quay.io/) images. ### WDL Feature Support; * Added support for the new WDL `basename` function.

This retry option is introduced to provide a method for tackling transient job failures. For example, if a task fails due to a timeout from accessing an external service, then this option helps re-run the failed the task without having to re-run the entire workflow. It takes an Int as a value that indicates the maximum number of times Cromwell should retry a failed task. This retry is applied towards jobs that fail while executing the task command. This method only applies to transient job failures and is a feeble attempt to retry a job, that is it cannot be used to increase memory in out-of-memory situations. If using the Google backend, it's important to note that The `maxRetries` count is independent from the [preemptible](#preemptible) count. For example, the task below can be retried up to 6 times if it's preempted 3 times AND the command execution fails 3 times. ```; runtime {; preemptible: 3; maxRetries: 3; }; ```. ### `continueOnReturnCode`; *Default: _0_*.

At the end of this tutorial you'll have configured your local environment to run workflows using Cromwell on AWS Batch. ### Let's get started!. To create all the resources for running a Cromwell server on AWS using CloudFormation, launch the [Cromwell Full Stack Deployment](https://docs.opendata.aws/genomics-workflows/orchestration/cromwell/cromwell-overview/). Alternatively, this page will walk through the specific steps to configure and run a local Cromwell server using AWS Batch. 1. [Authenticating a local Cromwell server with AWS](#authenticating-a-local-cromwell-server-with-aws); 2. [Configuring the AWS environment](#configuring-the-aws-environment); 3. [Configuring Cromwell](#configuring-cromwell); 4. [Workflow Source Files](#workflow-source-files); 5. [Running Cromwell and AWS](#running-cromwell-and-aws); 6. [Outputs](#outputs). #### Authenticating a local Cromwell server with AWS. The easiest way to allow a local Cromwell server to talk to AWS is to:. 1. Install the AWS CLI through Amazon's [user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html).; 2. [Configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) by calling `aws configure` (provide your `Access Key` and `Secret Access Key` when prompted). Cromwell can access these credentials through the default authentication provider. For more options, see the [Configuring authentication of Cromwell with AWS](/backends/AWSBatch#configuring-authentication) section below. #### Configuring the AWS environment.

As this only affects Google Batch API and not GCS, it's important that this service account, and the service account specified in `GCPBATCH.config.batch.auth` can both read/write the location specified by `GCPBATCH.config.root`. **User Service Account**. A [JSON key file for the service account](../wf_options/Google.md) must be passed in via the `user_service_account_json` field in the [Workflow Options](../wf_options/Google.md) when submitting the job. Omitting this field will cause the workflow to fail. The JSON should be passed as a string and will need to have no newlines and all instances of `""` and `\n` escaped. . In the likely event that this service account does not have access to Cromwell's default google project the `google_project` workflow option must be set. In the similarly likely case that this service account can not access Cromwell's default google bucket, the `gcp_batch_gcs_root` workflow option should be set appropriately. For information on the interaction of `user_service_account_json` with private Docker images please see the `Docker` section below. . **Docker**.

Strict validation will be disabled by default in WDL draft 2 and CWL but enabled in WDL draft 3. See the 'Language Factory Config' below for details. ### Language Factory Config; All language factories can now be configured on a per-language-version basis. All languages and versions will support the following options:; * `enabled`: Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` to disallow workflows of this language and version.; * `strict-validation`: Defaults to `true` for WDL draft 3 and `false` for WDL draft 2 and CWL. Specifies whether workflows fail if the inputs JSON (or YAML) file contains values which the workflow did not ask for (and will therefore have no effect). Additional strict checks may be added in the future. ### API. * More accurately returns 503 instead of 500 when Cromwell can not respond in a timely manner; * Cromwell now allows a user to submit a workflow but in a state where it will not automatically be picked up for execution. This new state is called 'On Hold'.

Before reading further in this section please see the; [Getting started on Google Cloud Batch](../tutorials/Batch101) for instructions common to all authentication modes; and detailed instructions for the application default authentication scheme in particular.; The instructions below assume you have created a Google Cloud Storage bucket and a Google project enabled for the appropriate APIs. *NOTE*: Google Cloud Batch is still in alpha version, this means that there could be breaking changes, be sure to review the [GCP Batch CHANGELOG](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#gcp-batch) carefully before upgrading. **Configuring Authentication**. The `google` stanza in the Cromwell configuration file defines how to authenticate to Google.

Two methods are available.; ""local"" will try to look for the image on the machine where cromwell is running. If it can't be found, Cromwell will try to `pull` the image and use the hash from the retrieved image.; ""remote"" will try to look up the image hash directly on the remote repository where the image is located (Docker Hub and GCR are supported); Note that the ""local"" option will require docker to be installed on the machine running cromwell, in order for it to call the docker CLI.; * Adds hash lookup support for public [quay.io](https://quay.io/) images. ### WDL Feature Support; * Added support for the new WDL `basename` function. Allows WDL authors to get just the file name from a File (i.e. removing the directory path); * Allows coercion of `Map` objects into `Array`s of `Pair`s. This also allows WDL authors to directly scatter over WDL `Map`s. ### Miscellaneous; * Adds support for JSON file format for google service account credentials.

Cromwell now supports call caching with floating Docker tags (e.g. `docker: ""ubuntu:latest""`). Note it is still considered; a best practice to specify Docker images as hashes where possible, especially for production usages. Within a single workflow Cromwell will attempt to resolve all floating tags to the same Docker hash, even if Cromwell is restarted; during the execution of a workflow. In call metadata the `docker` runtime attribute is now the same as the; value that actually appeared in the WDL:. ```; ""runtimeAttributes"": {; ""docker"": ""ubuntu:latest"",; ""failOnStderr"": ""false"",; ""continueOnReturnCode"": ""0""; }; ```. Previous versions of Cromwell rewrote the `docker` value to the hash of the Docker image. There is a new call-level metadata value `dockerImageUsed` which captures the hash of the Docker image actually used to; run the call:. ```; ""dockerImageUsed"": ""library/ubuntu@sha256:382452f82a8bbd34443b2c727650af46aced0f94a44463c62a9848133ecb1aa8""; ```. ### Docker. * The Docker section of the configuration has been slightly reworked; An option to specify how a Docker hash should be looked up has been added.

In HPC and multi-user environments, Docker recommends that ""only trusted users should be allowed to control your Docker Daemon"". For this reason, this tutorial will also explore other technologies that support the reproducibility and simplicity of running a workflow that use docker containers; Singularity and udocker. ___. ### Singularity. Singularity is a container technology designed for use on HPC systems in particular, while ensuring an appropriate level of security that Docker cannot provide. #### Installation; Before you can configure Cromwell on your HPC system, you will have to install Singularity, which is documented [here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/admin-guide/admin_quickstart.html#installation).; In order to gain access to the full set of features in Singularity, it is strongly recommended that Singularity is installed by root, with the `setuid` bit enabled, as is ([documented here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/2.6/admin-guide/security.html#how-does-singularity-do-it)).; This likely means that you will have to ask your sysadmin to install it for you.; Because `singularity` ideally needs `setuid`, your admins may have some qualms about giving Singularity this privilege.; If that is the case, you might consider forwarding [this letter](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html#singularity-on-a-shared-resource) to your admins. If you are not able to get Singularity installed with these privileges, you can attempt a user install.; If this is the case, you will have to alter your Cromwell configuration to work in ""sandbox"" mode, which is explained in [this part](#without-setuid) of the documentation. . #### Configuring Cromwell for Singularity.

At the end of this five minute introduction you will have:. - Downloaded Cromwell!; - Written your first workflow; - Run it through Cromwell. ### Step 1: Downloading Cromwell. We host our Cromwell releases on GitHub! You can find the latest version on our [Releases](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases/latest) page. * Look for the latest version at the top of the page, and find the link to download the jar. It'll have a name like `cromwell-XY.jar` where `XY` is the version. Download the jar file.; * WARNING! If you're on a Mac, the security settings might try to stop you from running Cromwell! Don't worry, if this happens just go to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General` and find the `cromwell` jar listed on the page. Click `Open anyway`. The `cromwell-XY.jar` will now automatically download to your `Downloads` directory.; * Put your downloaded Cromwell somewhere you can find it later, like in a Cromwell directory in your home directory. For example, in a terminal:; ```sh; cd ~; mkdir cromwell; cp ~/Downloads/cromwell-XY.jar cromwell/; cd cromwell/; ```; _(if you're not using a Mac, the final command might be different for you)_. ### Step 2: Writing your first workflow description. This bit is easy, you're just going to copy and paste something from the internet. Open your favorite editor. Paste in the following content and save it as `myWorkflow.wdl` in your new `cromwell` directory:. ```wdl; # Example workflow; # Declare WDL version 1.0 if working in Terra; version 1.0; workflow myWorkflow {; 	call myTask; }. task myTask {; 	command <<<; 		echo ""hello world""; 	>>>; 	output {; 		S",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/FiveMinuteIntro.md:1219,secur,security,1219,docs/tutorials/FiveMinuteIntro.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/FiveMinuteIntro.md,3,"['Secur', 'secur']","['Security', 'security']"

Security,"check with your security team before setting up your Cromwell server; - Some recommendations and suggestions on security can be found below. __This is intended as helpful guidance only, and is not endorsed by the Broad Institute.__. Cromwell running in server mode accepts all connections on the configured webservice port. Without taking additional measures to protect your Cromwell server, this can leave your Cromwell server and therefore all information stored by and accessible by your Cromwell server vulnerable to anyone who is able to access the server. For instance, an unprotected Cromwell server running against the [Google Cloud backend](backends/Google) would leave you vulnerable to outside users running workflows that will cost you money, and potentially access the data files you use within your workflows!. The simplest way to restrict access is by putting an authenticating proxy server in between users and the Cromwell server: . 1. Configure a firewall rule on the Cromwell server host to deny access to the webservice port (e.g. 8000) from all addresses except a secure proxy host. ; 2. Configure `<YourFavoriteWebProxy>` on the proxy host with `<YourFavoriteAuthMechanism>`, to proxy authenticated traffic from the world to the Cromwell server. Using Apache `httpd` web server for example with basic `htpassword` file-based authentication, the configuration might look something like:. ```Apache; <Location /cromwell>; Order deny,allow; Allow from all; AuthType Basic; AuthName ""Password Required""; AuthUserFile /path/to/my/htpasswdfile; Require user someone someoneelse; ProxyPass http://101.101.234.567:8000 # address of cromwell server web service; </Location>; ```. Users now hit `http://my.proxy.org/cromwell` with authenticated requests, and they're forwarded to port 8000 on the Cromwell server host. . **Multiple Servers on one Host**.

[Running Cromwell and AWS](#running-cromwell-and-aws); 6. [Outputs](#outputs). #### Authenticating a local Cromwell server with AWS. The easiest way to allow a local Cromwell server to talk to AWS is to:. 1. Install the AWS CLI through Amazon's [user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html).; 2. [Configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) by calling `aws configure` (provide your `Access Key` and `Secret Access Key` when prompted). Cromwell can access these credentials through the default authentication provider. For more options, see the [Configuring authentication of Cromwell with AWS](/backends/AWSBatch#configuring-authentication) section below. #### Configuring the AWS environment. Next you'll need the following setup in your AWS account:; - The core set of resources (S3 Bucket, IAM Roles, AWS Batch); - Custom Compute Resource (Launch Template or AMI) with Cromwell Additions. Information and instructions to setup an AWS environment to work properly with Cromwell can be found on [AWS for Genomics Workflow](https://docs.opendata.aws/genomics-workflows/core-env/introduction/). By deploying the CloudFormation templates provided by AWS, the stack will output the S3 bucket name and two AWS Batch queue ARNs (default and high-priority) used in the Cromwell configuration. #### Configuring Cromwell. Now we're going to configure Cromwell to use the AWS resources we just created by updating a `*.conf` file to use the `AWSBackend` at runtime. This requires three pieces of information:. - The [AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) where yo",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/AwsBatch101.md:1606,authenticat,authentication,1606,docs/tutorials/AwsBatch101.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/AwsBatch101.md,4,['authenticat'],['authentication']

Cromwell now supports call caching with floating Docker tags (e.g. `docker: ""ubuntu:latest""`). Note it is still considered; a best practice to specify Docker images as hashes where possible, especially for production usages. Within a single workflow Cromwell will attempt to resolve all floating tags to the same Docker hash, even if Cromwell is restarted; during the execution of a workflow. In call metadata the `docker` runtime attribute is now the same as the; value that actually appeared in the WDL:. ```; ""runtimeAttributes"": {; ""docker"": ""ubuntu:latest"",; ""failOnStderr"": ""false"",; ""continueOnReturnCode"": ""0""; }; ```. Previous versions of Cromwell rewrote the `docker` value to the hash of the Docker image. There is a new call-level metadata value `dockerImageUsed` which captures the hash of the Docker image actually used to; run the call:. ```; ""dockerImageUsed"": ""library/ubuntu@sha256:382452f82a8bbd34443b2c727650af46aced0f94a44463c62a9848133ecb1aa8""; ```. ### Docker. * The Docker section of the configuration has been slightly reworked; An option to specify how a Docker hash should be looked up has been added. Two methods are available.; ""local"" will try to look for the image on the machine where cromwell is running. If it can't be found, Cromwell will try to `pull` the image and use the hash from the retrieved image.; ""remote"" will try to look up the image hash directly on the remote repository where the image is located (Docker Hub and GCR are supported); Note that the ""local"" option will require docker to be installed on the machine running cromwell, in order for it to call the docker CLI.; * Adds hash lookup support for public [quay.io](h",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:91098,hash,hash,91098,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['hash'],['hash']
Security,"e `caching.duplication-strategy` field determines how Cromwell should behave w.r.t output files when call is being cached. The default strategy `copy` is to copy the file to its new call location. As mentioned, `reference` will not copy the file and simply point the results to the existing location.; See the [Call Caching documentation](../cromwell_features/CallCaching.md) for more information. ## Requester Pays. GCS has a feature called Requester Pays (RP). This section describes how Cromwell supports it and the consequences on cost. Please first read the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/requester-pays) if you're not already familiar with it. The billing project Cromwell uses to access a bucket with requester pays is determined as follows:. - If a `google_project` was set in the [workflow options](../wf_options/Google.md) when the workflow was submitted, this value is used; - Otherwise, the value of the `project` field in the `gcs` filesystem configuration is used; - Otherwise, if the machine Cromwell runs on is authenticated using gcloud and a default project is set, this value will be used. **Important Note #1**: In order for a project to be billable to access a bucket with requester pays, the credentials used need to have the `serviceusage.services.use` permission on this project. . **Important Note #2**: Pipelines API version 1 does **not** support buckets with requester pays, so while Cromwell itself might be able to access bucket with RP, jobs running on Pipelines API V1 with file inputs and / or outputs will **not** work.; For full requester pays support, use the [Pipelines API v2 Cromwell backend](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#pipelines-api-v2). . **Important Note #3**: Access to requester pays buckets from Cromwell is seamless, this also means that Cromwell will not report in the logs or metadata when it access a bucket with requester pays.

Enables the `floor`, `ceil` and `round` functions in WDL to convert floating point numbers to integers. For example we can now use the size of an input file to influence the amount of memory the task is given. In the example below a 500MB input file will result in a request for a VM with 2GB of memory:. ```; task foo {; File in_file; command { ... }; runtime {; docker: ""...""; memory: ceil(size(in_file)) * 4; }; }; ```. ### Call Caching. * Hash values calculated by Cromwell for a call when call caching is enabled are now published to the metadata.; It is published even if the call failed. However if the call is attempted multiple times (because it has been preempted for example),; since hash values are strictly identical for all attempts, they will only be published in the last attempt section of the metadata for this call.; If the hashes fail to be calculated, the reason is indicated in a `hashFailures` field in the `callCaching` section of the call metadata.; *Important*: Hashes are not retroactively published to the metadata. Which means only workflows run on Cromwell 28+ will have hashes in their metadata. See the [README](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell#get-apiworkflowsversionidmetadata) for an example metadata response. * New endpoint returning the hash differential for 2 calls. `GET /api/workflows/:version/callcaching/diff`. See the [README](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell#get-apiworkflowsversioncallcachingdiff) for more details. ### Workflow Submission. * The workflow submission parameters `wdlSource` and `wdlDependencies` have been deprecated in favor of `workflowSource` and; `workflowDependencies` respectively. The older names are still supported in Cromwell 28 with deprecation warnings but will; be removed in a future version of Cromwell. ### Labels; * A new `/labels` endpoint has been added to update labels for an existing workflow.

Cromwell tracks the execution of workflows and stores outputs of task invocations in a SQL database. Cromwell supports either an external MySQL database, or a temporary in-memory database. By default, Cromwell uses an in-memory database which will only live for the duration of the JVM. This provides a quick way to run workflows locally without having to set up MySQL, though it also makes workflow executions somewhat transient. To configure Cromwell to instead point to a MySQL database, first create the empty database. In the example below, the database name is `cromwell`. Then, edit your configuration file `database` stanza, as follows:. ```hocon; database {; profile = ""slick.jdbc.MySQLProfile$""; db {; driver = ""com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver""; url = ""jdbc:mysql://host/cromwell?rewriteBatchedStatements=true""; user = ""user""; password = ""pass""; connectionTimeout = 5000; }; }; ```. To see the full list of possible parameters and values for the `db` stanza see [the slick documentation](http://slick.lightbend.com/doc/3.2.0/api/index.html#slick.jdbc.JdbcBackend$DatabaseFactoryDef@forConfig(String,Config,Driver):Database). **Cromwell server on MySQL Database**. You can use [docker-compose](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/develop/scripts) to link together a Cromwell docker image (built locally with `sbt docker` or available on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/broadinstitute/cromwell/)) with a MySQL docker image. To change the version of Cromwell used, [change the tag in `compose/cromwell/Dockerfile`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/scripts/docker-compose-mysql/compose/cromwell/Dockerfile). **Local**. `docker-compose up` from this directory will start a Cromwell server running on a MySQL instance with local backend.

Security,"e top; include required(classpath(""application"")). # Add customizations; webservice.port = 58000; ```. Your configuration file can specify configuration as JSON-like stanzas or as dot-separated values. These next two examples are are equivalent. _JSON-like stanza:_. ```hocon; include required(classpath(""application"")); webservice {; port = 8000; interface = 0.0.0.0; }; ```. _Dot-separated values:_. ```hocon; include required(classpath(""application"")); webservice.port = 8000; webservice.interface = 0.0.0.0; ```. ## Configuration via command line. In addition to using configuration files, you can use dot-separated configuration names to specify values directly on the Java command line:. ```; $ java -Dwebservice.port=8080 cromwell.jar ...; ```. ## Advanced configuration. **WARNING:** These advanced configuration values can significantly affect the performance of Cromwell. . ### Server. By default the Cromwell server will bind to `0.0.0.0` on port `8000`. ; You can then access it through a browser at `http://localhost:8000`. ; To change these settings, simply edit the following values in your configuration file:. ```; webservice {; port = 9000; interface = 0.0.0.0; }; ```. The above configuration will use port `9000`. Cromwell uses `akka-http` to serve requests. For more advanced configuration settings, refer to the [akka-http](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/configuration.html) documentation. For example, to increase the request timeout to 30 seconds you can add this stanza to your configuration file:. ```; akka.http.server.request-timeout = 30s; ```. ### I/O. **I/O Throttling**. Certain [backends](backends/Backends) impose I/O limits. For example the Pipelines API imposes a quota on the number of queries that can be made per second. You can effectively control and throttle the number of requests and resources allocated to those operations in the `system.io` configuration:. ```; system.io {; number-of-requests = 100000; per = 100 seconds; }; ```. *",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md:2327,access,access,2327,docs/Configuring.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md,1,['access'],['access']

Copying uses a lot of; space if a multitude of tasks use the same input. `cached-copy` copies the file only once to the physical disk containing; the `<workflow_root>` and then uses hard links for every task that needs the input file. This can save a lot of space. The default order in `reference.conf` is `hard-link`, `soft-link`, `copy`. Shared filesystem localization is defined in the `config` section of each backend. The default stanza for the Local and HPC backends looks like this:. ```; filesystems {; local {; localization: [; 	 ""hard-link"", ""soft-link"", ""copy""; ]; }; }; ```. ### Optional docker soft links.

Thus any symbolic or; soft links pointing to files outside of the execution directory will resolve to paths that are not accessible within the; container.

Security,"etail; The behaviour of Cromwell with containers can be modified using a few other options. #### Enforcing container requirements; You can enforce the use of a container by not including the `submit` block in the provider section. However note that some interpolated variables (`${stdout}`, `${stderr}`) are different between these two blocks. #### Docker Digests. Each Docker repository has a number of tags that can be used to refer to the latest image of a particular type. ; For instance, when you run a normal Docker image with `docker run image`, it will actually run `image:latest`, the `latest` tag of that image. However, by default Cromwell requests and runs images using their `sha` hash, rather than using tags.; This strategy is actually preferable, because it ensures every execution of the task or workflow will use the exact same version of the image, but some engines such as `udocker` don't support this feature. If you are using `udocker` or want to disable the use of hash-based image references, you can set the following config option:; ```; docker.hash-lookup.enabled = false; ```. Nb: By disabling hash-lookup, call caching will not work for any container using a floating tag. #### Docker Root; If you want to change the root directory inside your containers, where the task places input and output files, you can edit the following option:. ```; backend {; providers {; LocalExample {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; ; # Root directory where Cromwell writes job results in the container. This value; # can be used to specify where the execution folder is mounted in the container.; # it is used for the construction of the docker_cwd string in the submit-docker; # value above.; dockerRoot = ""/cromwell-executions""; }; }; }; }; ```. #### Docker Config Block; Further docker configuration options available to be put into your config file are as follows. ; For the latest list of parameters, refer to the [exam",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md:17410,hash,hash-based,17410,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md,2,['hash'],['hash-based']

Security,"for your HPC tasks. In the config section for your backend, you can define the different [runtime attributes](../RuntimeAttributes) that your HPC tasks will support. Any runtime attribute configured here will be read from the WDL tasks, and then passed into the command line used to submit jobs to the HPC cluster. All runtime attributes must be defined in a single multi-line block. The syntax of this block is the same as defining the inputs for a WDL task. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int cpu = 1; Float? memory_gb; String? sge_queue; String? sge_project; """"""; }; ```. In the example above, we have defined four different WDL variables defined, `cpu`, `memory_gb`, `sge_queue`, and `sge_project`. Below you will find more information on `cpu` and `memory`, and the ability to add custom runtime attributes like the `sge_queue` and `sge_project`. **cpu**. When you declare a runtime attribute with the name `cpu`, it must be an `Int`. This integer will validated to always be `>= 1`. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int cpu = 1; # ...; """"""; }; ```. **memory**. When running a workflow, the memory runtime attribute in the task will specify the units of memory. For example, this jobs specifies that it only needs 512 megabytes of memory when running. ```wdl; task hello {; command { echo hello }; runtime { memory: ""512 MB"" }; }; ```. However, it's possible that when submitting jobs to your HPC cluster you want to specify the units in gigabytes. To specify the memory units that the submit command should use, append the units to the memory runtime attribute. For example:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Float? memory_gb; # ...; """"""; }; ```. Now, no matter what unit of memory is used within the task, the value will be converted into gigabytes before it is passed to your submit command. **custom attributes**. You can also declare other runtime attributes that a WDL task may use.

Security,"g additional measures to protect your Cromwell server, this can leave your Cromwell server and therefore all information stored by and accessible by your Cromwell server vulnerable to anyone who is able to access the server. For instance, an unprotected Cromwell server running against the [Google Cloud backend](backends/Google) would leave you vulnerable to outside users running workflows that will cost you money, and potentially access the data files you use within your workflows!. The simplest way to restrict access is by putting an authenticating proxy server in between users and the Cromwell server: . 1. Configure a firewall rule on the Cromwell server host to deny access to the webservice port (e.g. 8000) from all addresses except a secure proxy host. ; 2. Configure `<YourFavoriteWebProxy>` on the proxy host with `<YourFavoriteAuthMechanism>`, to proxy authenticated traffic from the world to the Cromwell server. Using Apache `httpd` web server for example with basic `htpassword` file-based authentication, the configuration might look something like:. ```Apache; <Location /cromwell>; Order deny,allow; Allow from all; AuthType Basic; AuthName ""Password Required""; AuthUserFile /path/to/my/htpasswdfile; Require user someone someoneelse; ProxyPass http://101.101.234.567:8000 # address of cromwell server web service; </Location>; ```. Users now hit `http://my.proxy.org/cromwell` with authenticated requests, and they're forwarded to port 8000 on the Cromwell server host. . **Multiple Servers on one Host**. The above scheme extends easily to multiple Cromwell instances, for use by different groups within an organization, for example. If multiple instances are running on the same host, then each instance should be run as its own dedicated user (such as service account when using a [Google Cloud backend](backends/Google)), e.g. `cromwell1`, `cromwell2` etc so that processes running under one Cromwell instance cannot access the files of another.

See [here](../backends/Google.md) for more info.; - The `project` field has to do with the Requester Pays feature (see below).; - The `caching.duplication-strategy` field determines how Cromwell should behave w.r.t output files when call is being cached. The default strategy `copy` is to copy the file to its new call location. As mentioned, `reference` will not copy the file and simply point the results to the existing location.; See the [Call Caching documentation](../cromwell_features/CallCaching.md) for more information. ## Requester Pays.

The response for a request timeout will now be plain text, rather than a JSON format. * **Metadata endpoint**; The response from the metadata endpoint can be quite large depending on your workflow. You can now opt-in to have Cromwell gzip your metadata file, in order to reduce file size, by sending the `Accept-Encoding: gzip` header. The default behavior now does not gzip encode responses. * **Engine endpoints**; Previously the engine endpoints were available under `/api/engine` but now the endpoints are under `/engine` so they don't require authentication. Workflow endpoints are still available under `/api/workflows`.

[Configuring Cromwell](#configuring-cromwell); 4. [Workflow Source Files](#workflow-source-files); 5. [Running Cromwell and AWS](#running-cromwell-and-aws); 6. [Outputs](#outputs). #### Authenticating a local Cromwell server with AWS. The easiest way to allow a local Cromwell server to talk to AWS is to:. 1. Install the AWS CLI through Amazon's [user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html).; 2. [Configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) by calling `aws configure` (provide your `Access Key` and `Secret Access Key` when prompted). Cromwell can access these credentials through the default authentication provider. For more options, see the [Configuring authentication of Cromwell with AWS](/backends/AWSBatch#configuring-authentication) section below. #### Configuring the AWS environment. Next you'll need the following setup in your AWS account:; - The core set of resources (S3 Bucket, IAM Roles, AWS Batch); - Custom Compute Resource (Launch Template or AMI) with Cromwell Additions. Information and instructions to setup an AWS environment to work properly with Cromwell can be found on [AWS for Genomics Workflow](https://docs.opendata.aws/genomics-workflows/core-env/introduction/).

Call Caching allows Cromwell to detect when a job has been run in the past so it doesn't have to re-compute results. ; To learn more see [Call Caching](cromwell_features/CallCaching). To enable Call Caching, add the following to your Cromwell configuration:. ```; call-caching {; enabled = true; invalidate-bad-cache-results = true; }; ```. When `call-caching.enabled=true` (default: `false`), Cromwell will be able to to reference or copy results from previously run jobs (when appropriate).; When `invalidate-bad-cache-results=true` (default: `true`), Cromwell will invalidate any cache results which contain files that cannot be accessed within a cache-hit.

(As of [2019-02-18](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/issues/112)) udocker does not support looking up docker container by digests, hence you'll have to make ensure `hash-lookup` is disabled. Refer to [this section](#docker-digests) for more detail. To configure `udocker` to work in a local environment, you must tag the provider's configuration to `run-in-background` and update the `submit-docker` to use udocker:; ```; run-in-background = true; submit-docker = """"""; udocker run -v ${cwd}:${docker_cwd} ${docker} ${job_shell} ${docker_script}; """"""; ```. With a job queue like SLURM, you just need to wrap this script in an `sbatch` submission like we did with Singularity:. ```; submit-docker = """"""; # Pull the image using the head node, in case our workers don't have network access; udocker pull ${docker}; ; sbatch \; -J ${job_name} \; -D ${cwd} \; -o ${cwd}/execution/stdout \; -e ${cwd}/execution/stderr \; -t ${runtime_minutes} \; ${""-c "" + cpus} \; --mem-per-cpu=${requested_memory_mb_per_core} \; --wrap ""udocker run -v ${cwd}:${docker_cwd} ${docker} ${job_shell} ${docker_script}""; """"""; ```. #### Caching; udocker caches images in a single directory, which defaults to [`~/.udocker`](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/blob/master/udocker.py#L137), meaning that caching is done on a per-user basis. ; However, like Singularity, if you want to share a cache with other users in your project,you you can override the location of the udocker cache directory either using:; * A config file [described here](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/blob/master/doc/installation_manual.md#9-configuration), containing a line such as `topdir = ""/path/to/cache""`.; * Using the environment variable `$UDOCKER_DIR`. ___. ### Configuration in Detail; The behaviour of Cromwell with containers can be modified using a few other options. #### Enforcing container requirements; You can enforce ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md:15459,access,access,15459,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md,2,['access'],['access']

The runtime attribute `nvidia-driver-version` was previously allowed only as a default runtime attribute in configuration.; Because WDL does not allow attribute names to contain `-` characters, this has been changed to `nvidiaDriverVersion`.; This field is now accepted within WDL files as well as within the configuration file. #### Logging long running jobs. All backends can now emit slow job warnings after a configurable time running.; NB This example shows how to configure this setting for the PAPIv2 backend:; ```conf; # Emit a warning if jobs last longer than this amount of time. This might indicate that something got stuck.; backend {; providers {; PAPIv2 {; config {; slow-job-warning-time: 24 hours; }; }; }; }; ```. ### Runtime Attributes. #### GPU Attributes. * The `gpuType` attribute is no longer validated against a whitelist at workflow submission time. Instead, validation now happens at runtime. This allows any valid accelerator to be used.; * The `nvidiaDriverVersion` attribute is now available in WDL `runtime` sections. The default continues to be `390.46` which applies if and only if GPUs are being used.; * A default `gpuType` (""nvidia-tesla-k80"") will now be applied if `gpuCount` is specified but `gpuType` is not.; * Similarly, a default `gpuCount` (1) will be applied if `gpuType` is specified but `cpuCount` is not. ### Bug fixes. #### Better validation of workflow heartbeats.

When Cromwell runs a task, it will fill in a template for the job using the declared runtime attributes. This specific template will vary depending on the requirements of your HPC cluster. For example, say you normally submit jobs to SGE using:. ```bash; qsub -terse -V -b y -N my_job_name \; -wd /path/to/working_directory \; -o /path/to/stdout.qsub \; -e /path/to/stderr.qsub \; -pe smp 1 -l mem_free=0.5g -q short \; /usr/bin/env bash myScript.bash; ```. For this particular SGE cluster, the above sets the working directory, stdout and stderr paths, the number of cpus to 1, the memory to half a gigabyte, and runs on the short queue. Converting this into a template using our runtime attributes requires defining `submit` as one would a WDL task `command`:. ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; submit = """"""; qsub \; -terse \; -V \; -b y \; -N ${job_name} ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md:4949,hash,hashes,4949,docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/HPCIntro.md,2,['hash'],['hashes']

In a multi-user environment user A might cache hit to one of user B's results; but that doesn't necessarily mean user A is authorized to read user B's outputs from the filesystem. Call cache blacklisting; allows Cromwell to record which file path prefixes were involved in cache result copy authorization failures.; If Cromwell sees that the file paths for a candidate cache hit have a blacklisted prefix, Cromwell will quickly ; fail the copy attempt without doing any potentially expensive I/O. Path prefix blacklisting could be supported by any backend type though it is currently implemented only for Google; (PAPI) backends. For Google backends the GCS bucket is considered the prefix for blacklisting purposes. ***Call cache whitelisting***; ; In a multi-user environment where access to job outputs may be restricted among different users, it can be useful to limit; cache hits to those that are more likely to actually be readable for cache hit copies.; Cromwell now supports a `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` workflow option for this purpose.

Install the AWS CLI through Amazon's [user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html).; 2. [Configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) by calling `aws configure` (provide your `Access Key` and `Secret Access Key` when prompted). Cromwell can access these credentials through the default authentication provider. For more options, see the [Configuring authentication of Cromwell with AWS](/backends/AWSBatch#configuring-authentication) section below. #### Configuring the AWS environment. Next you'll need the following setup in your AWS account:; - The core set of resources (S3 Bucket, IAM Roles, AWS Batch); - Custom Compute Resource (Launch Template or AMI) with Cromwell Additions. Information and instructions to setup an AWS environment to work properly with Cromwell can be found on [AWS for Genomics Workflow](https://docs.opendata.aws/genomics-workflows/core-env/introduction/). By deploying the CloudFormation templates provided by AWS, the stack will output the S3 bucket name and two AWS Batch queue ARNs (default and high-priority) used in the Cromwell configuration. #### Configuring Cromwell.

Grouping of blacklist caches can significantly improve blacklisting effectiveness and overall call caching performance.; Workflows should be grouped by their effective authorization to ensure the same filesystem/object store permissions; exist for every workflow in the group. **** Hit blacklisting ****. If a cache hit fails copying for any reason, Cromwell will record that failure in the blacklist cache and will not use; the hit again. Hit blacklisting is particularly effective at improving call caching performance in conjunction with the ; grouping feature described above. **** Path prefix (GCS bucket) blacklisting on 403 Forbidden errors ****. In a multi-user environment user A might cache hit to one of user B's results; but that doesn't necessarily mean user A is authorized to read user B's outputs from the filesystem.

Path prefix blacklisting could be supported by any backend type though it is currently implemented only for Google; (PAPI) backends. For Google backends the GCS bucket is considered the prefix for blacklisting purposes. ***Call cache whitelisting***; ; In a multi-user environment where access to job outputs may be restricted among different users, it can be useful to limit; cache hits to those that are more likely to actually be readable for cache hit copies.; Cromwell now supports a `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` workflow option for this purpose.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a popular container technology that is natively supported by Cromwell and WDL. #### Docker on a Local Backend. On a single machine (laptop or server), no extra configuration is needed to allow docker to run, provided Docker is installed. You can install Docker for Linux, Mac or Windows from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community). #### Docker on Cloud. It is strongly advised that you provide a Docker image to tasks that will run on Cloud backends, and in fact most Cloud providers require it. It might be possible to use an alternative container engine, but this is not recommended if Docker is supported. #### Docker on HPC. Docker can allow running users to gain superuser privileges, called the [Docker daemon attack surface](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface). In HPC and multi-user environments, Docker recommends that ""only trusted users should be allowed to control your Docker Daemon"". For this reason, this tutorial will also explore other technologies that support the reproducibility and simplicity of running a workflow that use docker containers; Singularity and udocker. ___. ### Singularity. Singularity is a container technology designed for use on HPC systems in particular, while ensuring an appropriate level of security that Docker cannot provide. #### Installation; Before you can configure Cromwell on your HPC system, you will have to install Singularity, which is documented [here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/admin-guide/admin_quickstart.html#installation).; In order to gain access to the full set of features in Singularity, it is strongly recommended that Singularity is installed by root, with the `setuid",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md:3754,attack,attack,3754,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md,2,['attack'],['attack']

As mentioned, `reference` will not copy the file and simply point the results to the existing location.; See the [Call Caching documentation](../cromwell_features/CallCaching.md) for more information. ## Requester Pays. GCS has a feature called Requester Pays (RP). This section describes how Cromwell supports it and the consequences on cost. Please first read the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/requester-pays) if you're not already familiar with it. The billing project Cromwell uses to access a bucket with requester pays is determined as follows:. - If a `google_project` was set in the [workflow options](../wf_options/Google.md) when the workflow was submitted, this value is used; - Otherwise, the value of the `project` field in the `gcs` filesystem configuration is used; - Otherwise, if the machine Cromwell runs on is authenticated using gcloud and a default project is set, this value will be used. **Important Note #1**: In order for a project to be billable to access a bucket with requester pays, the credentials used need to have the `serviceusage.services.use` permission on this project. . **Important Note #2**: Pipelines API version 1 does **not** support buckets with requester pays, so while Cromwell itself might be able to access bucket with RP, jobs running on Pipelines API V1 with file inputs and / or outputs will **not** work.; For full requester pays support, use the [Pipelines API v2 Cromwell backend](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#pipelines-api-v2). . **Important Note #3**: Access to requester pays buckets from Cromwell is seamless, this also means that Cromwell will not report in the logs or metadata when it access a bucket with requester pays. It is the user's responsibility to be aware of the extra cost of running workflows access requester pays buckets.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/GoogleCloudStorage.md:2409,access,access,2409,docs/filesystems/GoogleCloudStorage.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/GoogleCloudStorage.md,4,['access'],['access']

Enables the `floor`, `ceil` and `round` functions in WDL to convert floating point numbers to integers. For example we can now use the size of an input file to influence the amount of memory the task is given. In the example below a 500MB input file will result in a request for a VM with 2GB of memory:. ```; task foo {; File in_file; command { ... }; runtime {; docker: ""...""; memory: ceil(size(in_file)) * 4; }; }; ```. ### Call Caching. * Hash values calculated by Cromwell for a call when call caching is enabled are now published to the metadata.; It is published even if the call failed.

Two methods are available.; ""local"" will try to look for the image on the machine where cromwell is running. If it can't be found, Cromwell will try to `pull` the image and use the hash from the retrieved image.; ""remote"" will try to look up the image hash directly on the remote repository where the image is located (Docker Hub and GCR are supported); Note that the ""local"" option will require docker to be installed on the machine running cromwell, in order for it to call the docker CLI.; * Adds hash lookup support for public [quay.io](https://quay.io/) images. ### WDL Feature Support; * Added support for the new WDL `basename` function. Allows WDL authors to get just the file name from a File (i.e. removing the directory path); * Allows coercion of `Map` objects into `Array`s of `Pair`s.

In this example the two directories `/mnt/one` and and `/mnt/two` will also be available within containers at their; original paths outside the container. So soft links pointing to paths under those directories will resolve during the; job execution. Note that if a user runs a workflow using an input file `/mnt/three/path/to/file` the job will fail; during execution as `/mnt/three` was not present inside the running container. ### Additional FileSystems. HPC backends (as well as the Local backend) can be configured to be able to interact with other type of filesystems, where the input files can be located for example.; Currently the only other filesystem supported is Google Cloud Storage (GCS). See the [Google section](Google) of the documentation for information on how to configure GCS in Cromwell.; Once you have a google authentication configured, you can simply add a `gcs` stanza in your configuration file to enable GCS:. ```; backend.providers.MyHPCBackend {; filesystems {; gcs {; # A reference to a potentially different auth for manipulating files via engine functions.; auth = ""application-default""; }; }; }; ```. ### Exit code timeout. If the cluster forcefully kills a job, it is unable to write its exit code anymore.; To address this the option `exit-code-timeout-seconds` can be used.; Cromwell will check the aliveness of the job with the `check-alive` script, every `exit-code-timeout-seconds` (polling).; When a job is no longer alive and another `exit-code-timeout-seconds` seconds have passed without an RC file being made, Cromwell can mark the job as failed.; If retries are enabled the job is submitted again.; This option will enable polling with the `check-alive` option, this could cause high load on whatever system `check-alive` calls.

To allow Cromwell to talk to AWS, the `default` authentication scheme uses the [default authentication provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html) with the following AWS search paths:; - Environment Variables - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`; - Java system properties - `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretKey`; - Default credential profiles file - Created by the AWS CLI, typically located at `~/.aws/credentials`; - _Instance profile credentials_ - Only relevant on EC2 instances. ### Allowing private Docker containers. AWS Batch allows the use of private Docker containers by providing `dockerhub` credentials. Under the specific backend's configuration, you can provide the following object:. ```hocon; (backend.providers.AWSBatch.config.)dockerhub = {; // account = """"; // token = """"; }; ```. ### More configuration options. * `(backend.providers.AWSBatch.config.)concurrent-job-limit` specifies the number of jobs that Cromwell will allow to be running in AWS at the same time. Tune this parameter based on how many nodes are in the compute environment.; * `(backend.providers.AWSBatch.config.)root` points to the S3 bucket where workflow outputs are stored.

It is recommended that one look in the Cromwell codebase for more information on; these and other types. #### BackendWorkflowInitializationActor. If a backend developer wishes to take advantage of the initialization phase of the backend lifecycle they must implement; this trait. There are three functions which must be implemented:. * [`abortInitialization: Unit`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/93392acf2881921dcf22ef4dbda12af42339b3ab/backend/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/BackendWorkflowInitializationActor.scala#L168); specifies what to do, if anything, when a workflow is requested to abort while a backend initialization is in; progress.; * [`validate: Future[Unit]`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/93392acf2881921dcf22ef4dbda12af42339b3ab/backend/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/BackendWorkflowInitializationActor.scala#L178); is provided so that the backend can ensure that all of the calls it will handle conform to the rules of that backend.; For instance, if a backend requires particular runtime attributes to exist.; * [`beforeAll: Future[Option[BackendInitializationData]]`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/93392acf2881921dcf22ef4dbda12af42339b3ab/backend/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/BackendWorkflowInitializationActor.scala#L173); is the actual initialization functionality.

Security,"nd is not endorsed by the Broad Institute.__. Cromwell running in server mode accepts all connections on the configured webservice port. Without taking additional measures to protect your Cromwell server, this can leave your Cromwell server and therefore all information stored by and accessible by your Cromwell server vulnerable to anyone who is able to access the server. For instance, an unprotected Cromwell server running against the [Google Cloud backend](backends/Google) would leave you vulnerable to outside users running workflows that will cost you money, and potentially access the data files you use within your workflows!. The simplest way to restrict access is by putting an authenticating proxy server in between users and the Cromwell server: . 1. Configure a firewall rule on the Cromwell server host to deny access to the webservice port (e.g. 8000) from all addresses except a secure proxy host. ; 2. Configure `<YourFavoriteWebProxy>` on the proxy host with `<YourFavoriteAuthMechanism>`, to proxy authenticated traffic from the world to the Cromwell server. Using Apache `httpd` web server for example with basic `htpassword` file-based authentication, the configuration might look something like:. ```Apache; <Location /cromwell>; Order deny,allow; Allow from all; AuthType Basic; AuthName ""Password Required""; AuthUserFile /path/to/my/htpasswdfile; Require user someone someoneelse; ProxyPass http://101.101.234.567:8000 # address of cromwell server web service; </Location>; ```. Users now hit `http://my.proxy.org/cromwell` with authenticated requests, and they're forwarded to port 8000 on the Cromwell server host. . **Multiple Servers on one Host**. The above scheme extends easily to multiple Cromwell instances, for use by different groups within an organization, for example. If multiple instances are running on the same host, then each instance should be run as its own dedicated user (such as service account when using a [Google Cloud backend](backends/Google)), e",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/Security.md:1345,authenticat,authenticated,1345,docs/developers/Security.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/Security.md,1,['authenticat'],['authenticated']

For multi-instance Cromwell deployments sharing a single database, earlier versions of Cromwell required abort; requests to be sent specifically to the instance that was running the targeted workflow. Cromwell 37 now; allows abort commands to be sent to any Cromwell instance in the shared-database deployment. Configuration details; [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/Configuring/abort-configuration). ### Call cache blacklisting. The Google Pipelines API (PAPI) version 1 and 2 backends now offer the option of call cache blacklisting on a per-bucket basis.; More info [here](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/CallCaching/#call-cache-copy-authorization-failure-prefix-blacklisting). ### WDL. - All memory units in WDL are now treated as base-2.; For instance `1 KB == 1 KiB == 1024 Bytes`. ### Backend name for call caching purposes. Previous versions of Cromwell incorporated the name of the backend on which a call was run into the call cache hashes generated for that call.; Unfortunately this made it impossible to change the name of a backend without losing all previously run calls as potential cache hits.; Cromwell 37 introduces the `name-for-call-caching-purposes` backend configuration option as a means of decoupling the backend name from the; value used for the backend name for call caching purposes. ### CWL. Support `InputResourceRequirement` hint. ### Changing configuration options. #### Logging Token Distribution.

When choosing the image version for your pipeline stages, it is highly recommended that you use a hash rather than a tag, for the sake of reproducibility; For example, in WDL, you could do this:; ```wdl; runtime {; docker: 'ubuntu:latest'; }; ```. But what you should do is this:; ```wdl; runtime {; docker: 'ubuntu@sha256:7a47ccc3bbe8a451b500d2b53104868b46d60ee8f5b",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md:18556,hash,hash-lookup,18556,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md,2,['hash'],['hash-lookup']

This is analogous to the previously existing refresh token authentication scheme. As with the refresh token scheme it is encouraged that the **user_service_account_json** workflow option field is added to the **encrypted-fields** list in the configuration. * **Bugfixes**; Abort of Dockerized tasks on the Local backend should now work as expected. Cromwell uses `docker kill` to kill the Docker container. ## 29 Release Notes. ### Breaking Changes. * **Command line**; In preparation for supporting CWL scripts (yes, you read that right!), we have extensively revised the Command Line in Cromwell 29.

Please check the [README](README.md#label-format) for more detailed documentation.; * Custom labels won't be submitted to Google backend as they are now decoupled from Google's default labels.; * Cromwell now publishes the labels as soon as the workflow is submitted (whether started or on hold). If the labels are invalid, the workflow will not be submitted and request will fail. ### Scala 2.11 Removed; From version 32 onwards we will no longer be publishing build artifacts compatible with Scala 2.11. * If you don't import the classes into your own scala project then this should have no impact on you.; * If you **are** importing the classes into your own scala project, make sure you are using Scala 2.12. ### Input Validation; Cromwell can now validate that your inputs files do not supply inputs with no impact on the workflow. Strict validation will be disabled by default in WDL draft 2 and CWL but enabled in WDL draft 3. See the 'Language Factory Config' below for details. ### Language Factory Config; All language factories can now be configured on a per-language-version basis. All languages and versions will support the following options:; * `enabled`: Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` to disallow workflows of this language and version.; * `strict-validation`: Defaults to `true` for WDL draft 3 and `false` for WDL draft 2 and CWL. Specifies whether workflows fail if the inputs JSON (or YAML) file contains values which the workflow did not ask for (and will therefore have no effect). Additional strict checks may be added in the future. ### API. * More accurately returns 503 instead of 500 when Cromwell can not respond in a timely manner; * Cromwell now allows a user to submit a workflow but in a state where it will not automatically be picked u",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:71768,validat,validate,71768,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['validat'],['validate']

Cromwell 46 enhances this handling in response to user reports of possible continued issues. ## 45 Release Notes. ### Improved input and output transfer performance on PAPI v2. Cromwell now requires only a single PAPI ""action"" each for the entire localization or delocalization process, rather than two per file or directory.; This greatly increases execution speed for jobs with large numbers of input or output files.; In testing, total execution time for a call with 800 inputs improved from more than 70 minutes to less than 20 minutes. ### List dependencies flag in Womtool Command Line [(#5098)](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/5098).

For example, if Cromwell configuration contains `call-caching.blacklisting.groupings.workflow-option = ""project""` and; a workflow is submitted with the options. ```json; {; ""project"": ""Mary""; }; ```. then this workflow will share a blacklist cache with any other workflows whose workflow options contain `""project"": ""Mary""`. Grouping of blacklist caches can significantly improve blacklisting effectiveness and overall call caching performance.; Workflows should be grouped by their effective authorization to ensure the same filesystem/object store permissions; exist for every workflow in the group. **** Hit blacklisting ****.

As mentioned, `reference` will not copy the file and simply point the results to the existing location.; See the [Call Caching documentation](../cromwell_features/CallCaching.md) for more information. ## Requester Pays. GCS has a feature called Requester Pays (RP). This section describes how Cromwell supports it and the consequences on cost. Please first read the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/requester-pays) if you're not already familiar with it. The billing project Cromwell uses to access a bucket with requester pays is determined as follows:. - If a `google_project` was set in the [workflow options](../wf_options/Google.md) when the workflow was submitted, this value is used; - Otherwise, the value of the `project` field in the `gcs` filesystem configuration is used; - Otherwise, if the machine Cromwell runs on is authenticated using gcloud and a default project is set, this value will be used. **Important Note #1**: In order for a project to be billable to access a bucket with requester pays, the credentials used need to have the `serviceusage.services.use` permission on this project. . **Important Note #2**: Pipelines API version 1 does **not** support buckets with requester pays, so while Cromwell itself might be able to access bucket with RP, jobs running on Pipelines API V1 with file inputs and / or outputs will **not** work.; For full requester pays support, use the [Pipelines API v2 Cromwell backend](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.m",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/GoogleCloudStorage.md:1923,access,access,1923,docs/filesystems/GoogleCloudStorage.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/GoogleCloudStorage.md,1,['access'],['access']

Security,"opy attempt without doing any potentially expensive I/O. Path prefix blacklisting could be supported by any backend type though it is currently implemented only for Google; (PAPI) backends. For Google backends the GCS bucket is considered the prefix for blacklisting purposes. ***Call cache whitelisting***; ; In a multi-user environment where access to job outputs may be restricted among different users, it can be useful to limit; cache hits to those that are more likely to actually be readable for cache hit copies.; Cromwell now supports a `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` workflow option for this purpose. This is particularly useful in the PAPI backend where the workflow; root can be specified in workflow options via `jes_gcs_root`. The value of `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` should be an array of strings representing ; prefixes that call cache hit output files should have in order to be considered as a cache hit. Using PAPI as an example and assuming Alice and Bob have; made their data accessible to each other, Alice could submit a workflow with these options:. ```; {; ""call_cache_hit_path_prefixes"": [ ""gs://alice_bucket"", ""gs://bob_bucket"" ]; }; ```. With these workflow options Cromwell would only look for cache hits for Alice's jobs in Alice's or Bob's buckets. As a further optimization the PAPI backend has the concept of ""this"" bucket on a per-workflow basis, where ""this"" bucket is; the bucket that contains the current workflow root.; If `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` is specified in ; workflow options on the PAPI backend, Cromwell will automatically prepend ""this"" bucket to the call cache hit path prefixes to search.; For example, if Charles specified the same workflow options as in the example above and his workflow root was under `gs://charles_bucket`,; Cromwell would search cache hits in all of the `gs://alice_bucket`, `gs://bob_bucket` and `gs://charles_bucket` buckets without having to specify; `gs://charles_bucket` bucket explicitly in `call_cache_hit_path_p",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md:6709,access,accessible,6709,docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,1,['access'],['accessible']

Possible values are ""local"" and ""remote""; # ""local"": Lookup hashes on the local docker daemon using the cli; # ""remote"": Lookup hashes on docker hub, gcr, gar, quay; #method = ""remote""; }; }; ```. ### Best Practices. #### Image Versions. When choosing the image version for your pipeline stages, it is highly recommended that you use a hash rather than a tag, for the sake of reproducibility; For example, in WDL, you could do this:; ```wdl; runtime {; docker: 'ubuntu:latest'; }; ```. But what you should do is this:; ```wdl; runtime {; docker: 'ubuntu@sha256:7a47ccc3bbe8a451b500d2b53104868b46d60ee8f5b35a24b41a86077c650210'; }; ```. You can find the `sha256` of an image using `docker images --digests`; ; ; ### Notes. #### How does Cromwell know when a job or container has completed?; Cromwell uses the presence of the `rc` (returncode) file to determine whether a task has succeeded or failed.

Security,"other options. #### Enforcing container requirements; You can enforce the use of a container by not including the `submit` block in the provider section. However note that some interpolated variables (`${stdout}`, `${stderr}`) are different between these two blocks. #### Docker Digests. Each Docker repository has a number of tags that can be used to refer to the latest image of a particular type. ; For instance, when you run a normal Docker image with `docker run image`, it will actually run `image:latest`, the `latest` tag of that image. However, by default Cromwell requests and runs images using their `sha` hash, rather than using tags.; This strategy is actually preferable, because it ensures every execution of the task or workflow will use the exact same version of the image, but some engines such as `udocker` don't support this feature. If you are using `udocker` or want to disable the use of hash-based image references, you can set the following config option:; ```; docker.hash-lookup.enabled = false; ```. Nb: By disabling hash-lookup, call caching will not work for any container using a floating tag. #### Docker Root; If you want to change the root directory inside your containers, where the task places input and output files, you can edit the following option:. ```; backend {; providers {; LocalExample {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; ; # Root directory where Cromwell writes job results in the container.

This enhancement applies only to WDL 1.0 and later, because that's when `size()` added [support for arrays](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/main/versions/1.0/SPEC.md#acceptable-compound-input-types). #### Fixed Optional and String Concatenation Bug. As outlined in the [WDL Spec](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/main/versions/1.0/SPEC.md#prepending-a-string-to-an-optional-parameter), concatenating a string with an empty optional now correctly evaluates to the empty string. ### Removals. #### `RESTAPI.md` docs discontinued. Due to deprecation of the underlying library, Markdown docs will no longer be generated from the Cromwell API Swagger. The recommended alternative is starting a server and viewing the Swagger directly. #### Removed Docker Hub health check. Cromwell's healthcheck requests to Docker Hub were not authenticated, and thus became subject to rate limiting. To eliminate these false alarms, this functionality has been removed. The config key `services.HealthMonitor.config.check-dockerhub` is therefore obsolete. There is no change to any other usage of Docker Hub. #### Removed GCS health check. Cromwell's health check of GCS has been removed. GCS does not have availability issues of note, and in typical configurations the check does not meaningfully test Cromwell's permissions. The config keys `services.HealthMonitor.config.check-gcs` and `.gcs-bucket-to-check` are therefore obsolete. #### Removed Genomics Backend code; Code relating to the Google Genomics API (aka `v1Alpha`) has been removed since Google has entirely disabled that service.; Cloud Life Sciences (aka `v2Beta`, deprecated) and Google Batch (aka `batch`, recommended) remain the two viable GCP backends. ## 87 Release Notes. ### GCP Batch. * Added Nvidia driver install (default 418) ([#7235](https://github.com/broadinstitu",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:4505,authenticat,authenticated,4505,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['authenticat'],['authenticated']

Security,"rl = ""jdbc:mysql://host/cromwell?rewriteBatchedStatements=true&serverTimezone=UTC""; ```. Using this option does not alter your database's underlying timezone; rather, it causes Cromwell to ""speak UTC"" when communicating with the DB, and the DB server performs the conversion for you. . **Using Cromwell with Postgresql**. To use Postgresql as the database, you will need to install and enable the; Large Object extension. If the extension is present, setting up the database; requires just these commands:. ```; $ createdb cromwell; $ psql -d cromwell -c ""create extension lo;""; ```. Postgresql configuration in Cromwell is very similar to MySQL. An example:. ```hocon; database {; profile = ""slick.jdbc.PostgresProfile$""; db {; driver = ""org.postgresql.Driver""; url = ""jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/cromwell""; user = ""user""; password = ""pass""; port = 5432; connectionTimeout = 5000; }; }; ```. If you want multiple database users to be able to read Cromwell's data from a Postgresql database, you'll need to create a; role that all relevant users have access to, and adjust Cromwell to use this role. This is because each Large Object is owned; by, and only readable by, the role that wrote it. First, pass these options when executing Cromwell. They will ensure that Cromwell's database tables are ; owned by the role, not the initial login user.; * `-DengineSharedCromwellDbRole=your_role` to control the role that owns the engine tables; * `-DsharedCromwellDbRole=your_role` to control the role that owns the metadata tables. Next, use the config key `pgLargeObjectWriteRole` to set the role that should own all large objects, as shown below. ; This config will have no effect if you aren't using Postgresql. The configured login user can be any user that is; granted the shared role. ```hocon; database {; profile = ""slick.jdbc.PostgresProfile$""; pgLargeObjectWriteRole = ""your_role""; db {; driver = ""org.postgresql.Driver""; url = ""jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/cromwell""; user = ""user""; pa",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md:12380,access,access,12380,docs/Configuring.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md,1,['access'],['access']

For backends that support aborting jobs, Cromwell can be configured to automatically try to abort all calls when it receives a Control-C, also known as SIGINT. All currently running calls will also set their status to `Aborted`. To explicitly turn this feature on or off, set the configuration option:. ```hocon; system {; abort-jobs-on-terminate=true; }; ```.

For more information see [Docker's api specs](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#/content-digests).; A docker image can be referenced using the digest (e.g. `ubuntu@sha256:71cd81252a3563a03ad8daee81047b62ab5d892ebbfbf71cf53415f29c130950`).; This image refers to a specific image of ubuntu that does not depend on a floating tag.; A workflow containing this Docker image run now and a year from now will run in the exact same container. However, in order to remove unpredictable behaviors, when Cromwell finds a job ready to be run, it will first look at its docker runtime attribute, and apply the following logic:. * If the job doesn't specify a docker image it will be dispatched and all call caching settings (read/write) will apply normally.; * If the job does specify a docker runtime attribute, then:; * if the docker image uses a hash, all call caching settings apply normally; * if the docker image uses a floating tag:; * Cromwell will attempt to look up the immutable digest of the image with this floating tag.

Security,"s not required, and vice versa. Also note that for the `user_service_account_json` workflow option to work an auth of type `user_service_account`; must be defined in Cromwell's `google.auths` stanza; more details in the `User Service Account` section above. Example PAPI v2 workflow options for private Docker configuration:. ```; {; ""docker_credentials_key_name"": ""name/of/the/kms/key/used/for/encrypting/and/decrypting/the/docker/hub/token"",; ""docker_credentials_token"": ""base64_username:password"",; ""user_service_account_json"": ""<properly escaped user service account JSON file>""; }; ```. Important. If any of the three private Docker configuration values of key name, auth, or Docker token are missing, PAPI v2 will not perform a `docker login`.; If the Docker image to be pulled is not public the `docker pull` will fail which will cause the overall job to fail. If using any of these private Docker workflow options it is advisable to add; them to the `workflow-options.encrypted-fields` list in Cromwell configuration. **Monitoring**. In order to monitor metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk usage...) about the VM during Call Runtime, a workflow option can be used to specify the path to a script that will run in the background and write its output to a log file. ```; {; ""monitoring_script"": ""gs://cromwell/monitoring/script.sh""; }; ```. The output of this script will be written to a `monitoring.log` file that will be available in the call gcs bucket when the call completes. This feature is meant to run a script in the background during long-running processes. It's possible that if the task is very short that the log file does not flush before de-localization happens and you will end up with a zero byte file. **Google Cloud Storage Filesystem**. On the Google Pipelines backend the GCS (Google Cloud Storage) filesystem is used for the root of the workflow execution.; On the Local, SGE, and associated backends any GCS URI will be downloaded locally.

There is a new call-level metadata value `dockerImageUsed` which captures the hash of the Docker image actually used to; run the call:. ```; ""dockerImageUsed"": ""library/ubuntu@sha256:382452f82a8bbd34443b2c727650af46aced0f94a44463c62a9848133ecb1aa8""; ```. ### Docker. * The Docker section of the configuration has been slightly reworked; An option to specify how a Docker hash should be looked up has been added. Two methods are available.; ""local"" will try to look for the image on the machine where cromwell is running. If it can't be found, Cromwell will try to `pull` the image and use the hash from the retrieved image.; ""remote"" will try to look up the image hash directly on the remote repository where the image is located (Docker Hub and GCR are supported); Note that the ""local"" option will require docker to be installed on the machine running cromwell, in order for it to call the docker CLI.; * Adds hash lookup support for public [quay.io](https://quay.io/) images. ### WDL Feature Support; * Added support for the new WDL `basename` function. Allows WDL authors to get just the file name from a File (i.e. removing the directory path); * Allows coercion of `Map` objects into `Array`s of `Pair`s. This also allows WDL authors to directly scatter over WDL `Map`s. ### Miscellaneous; * Adds support for JSON file format for google service account credentials. As of Cromwell 27, PEM credentials for PAPI are deprecated and support might be removed in a future version. ```; google {. application-name = ""cromwell"". auths = [; {; name = ""service-account""; scheme = ""service_account""; json-file = ""/path/to/file.json""; }; ]; }; ```. ### General Changes. * The `/query` endpoint now supports querying by `label`. See the [README](README.md#get-apiworkflowsversionquery) for more information.; * The `read_X` standard library functions limit accepted filesizes. These differ by type, e.g. read_bool has a smaller limit",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:92036,hash,hash,92036,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['hash'],['hash']
Security,"s. Cromwell releases are available at the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases/latest) page. ; You are strongly encouraged to use the latest release of Cromwell whenever possible. Cromwell is distributed as a conda package on [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/).; These instructions need to be followed for [installing the miniconda distribution](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and ; [activating the conda-forge channel](https://conda-forge.org/#about). After this Cromwell can be installed in the ; base environment with `conda install -c conda-forge cromwell` or a separate environment for Cromwell can be created with ; `conda create -n cromwell cromwell` (be sure to activate the conda-forge channel first). ; If you are using Cromwell for bioinformatics workflows, you might like to take; a look at [bioconda](http://bioconda.github.io) as well. ; The conda installation of Cromwell comes with a wrapper that locates the jar for you and allows for running Cromwell or Womtool with a ; `cromwell run`, `womtool validate` or other command. Conda also installs the required Java dependency ; in the environment automatically. Mac users with Homebrew can also get Cromwell with the command `brew install cromwell`. This documentation frequently refers to a ""Cromwell jar"" with a name like `cromwell-<version>.jar`. ; This is the main artifact in Cromwell releases that contains all executable Cromwell code and default configuration. . A distribution of Java 17 is required to run Cromwell. Cromwell is developed, tested, and containerized using; [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17).

However note that some interpolated variables (`${stdout}`, `${stderr}`) are different between these two blocks. #### Docker Digests. Each Docker repository has a number of tags that can be used to refer to the latest image of a particular type. ; For instance, when you run a normal Docker image with `docker run image`, it will actually run `image:latest`, the `latest` tag of that image. However, by default Cromwell requests and runs images using their `sha` hash, rather than using tags.; This strategy is actually preferable, because it ensures every execution of the task or workflow will use the exact same version of the image, but some engines such as `udocker` don't support this feature. If you are using `udocker` or want to disable the use of hash-based image references, you can set the following config option:; ```; docker.hash-lookup.enabled = false; ```. Nb: By disabling hash-lookup, call caching will not work for any container using a floating tag. #### Docker Root; If you want to change the root directory inside your containers, where the task places input and output files, you can edit the following option:. ```; backend {; providers {; LocalExample {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.sfs.config.ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; ; # Root directory where Cromwell writes job results in the container.

Call caching hashes with this new strategy are based on the path and the last modified time of the file. ### Instance independent abort. For multi-instance Cromwell deployments sharing a single database, earlier versions of Cromwell required abort; requests to be sent specifically to the instance that was running the targeted workflow. Cromwell 37 now; allows abort commands to be sent to any Cromwell instance in the shared-database deployment. Configuration details; [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/Configuring/abort-configuration). ### Call cache blacklisting. The Google Pipelines API (PAPI) version 1 and 2 backends now offer the option of call cache blacklisting on a per-bucket basis.; More info [here](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/CallCaching/#call-cache-copy-authorization-failure-prefix-blacklisting). ### WDL. - All memory units in WDL are now treated as base-2.; For instance `1 KB == 1 KiB == 1024 Bytes`. ### Backend name for call caching purposes. Previous versions of Cromwell incorporated the name of the backend on which a call was run into the call cache hashes generated for that call.; Unfortunately this made it impossible to change the name of a backend without losing all previously run calls as potential cache hits.; Cromwell 37 introduces the `name-for-call-caching-purposes` backend configuration option as a means of decoupling the backend name from the; value used for the backend name for call caching purposes. ### CWL.

Since no `local-disk` entry is specified, Cromwell will automatically add `local-disk 10 SSD` to this list. ### `noAddress`. This runtime attribute adds support to disable assigning external IP addresses to VMs provisioned by the Google backend. If set to true, the VM will NOT be provided with a public IP address, and only contain an internal IP. If this option is enabled, the associated job can only load docker images from Google Container Registry, and the job executable cannot use external services other than Google APIs. Note well! You must enable ""Private Google Access"" for this feature to work. See ""How To Setup"" below. For example, the task below will succeed:; ```; command {; echo ""hello!""; ; }. runtime {; docker: ""gcr.io/gcp-runtimes/ubuntu_16_0_4:latest""; noAddress: true; }; ```. The task below will fail for two reasons:; 1. The command is accessing an external service, in this case GitHub.; 2. The docker image is available in DockerHub and not the Google Container Registry. ; ```; command {; git clone https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell.git; ; }. runtime {; docker: ""docker.io/alpine/git:latest""; noAddress: true; }; ```. #### How to Setup. Configure your Google network to use ""Private Google Access"". This will allow your VMs to access Google Services including Google Container Registry, as well as Dockerhub images. 1. Using `gcloud compute networks subnets list`, identify the subnet and region you will be using with Cromwell. If multiple, run the next step for each region and subnet you wish to use.; 1. `gcloud compute networks subnets update [SUBNET-NAME] --region [REGION] --enable-private-ip-google-access`. That's it!

The `google` stanza in the Cromwell configuration file defines how to authenticate to Google. There are four different; authentication schemes that might be used:. * `application_default` (default, recommended) - Use [application default](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials) credentials.; * `service_account` - Use a specific service account and key file (in PEM format) to authenticate.; * `user_account` - Authenticate as a user.; * `user_service_account` - Authenticate each individual workflow using service account credentials supplied in the workflow options. The `auths` block in the `google` stanza defines the authentication schemes within a Cromwell deployment:. ```hocon; google {; application-name = ""cromwell""; auths = [; {; name = ""application-default""; scheme = ""application_default""; },; {; name = ""service-account""; scheme = ""service_account""; service-account-id = ""my-service-account""; pem-file = ""/path/to/file.pem""; },; {; name = ""user-service-account""; scheme = ""user_service_account""; }; ]; }; ```. These authentication schemes can be referenced by name within other portions of the configuration file. For example, both; the `GCPBATCH` and `filesystems.gcs` sections within a Google configuration block must reference an auth defined in this block.; The auth for the `GCPBATCH` section governs the interactions wit",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/GCPBatch.md:1546,authenticat,authenticate,1546,docs/backends/GCPBatch.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/backends/GCPBatch.md,1,['authenticat'],['authenticate']

The service account you provide must have been granted Service Account Actor role to Cromwell's primary service account. As this only affects Google Batch API and not GCS, it's important that this service account, and the service account specified in `GCPBATCH.config.batch.auth` can both read/write the location specified by `GCPBATCH.config.root`. **User Service Account**. A [JSON key file for the service account](../wf_options/Google.md) must be passed in via the `user_service_account_json` field in the [Workflow Options](../wf_options/Google.md) when submitting the job. Omitting this field will cause the workflow to fail. The JSON should be passed as a string and will need to have no newlines and all instances of `""` and `\n` escaped. . In the likely event that this service account does not have access to Cromwell's default google project the `google_project` workflow option must be set. In the similarly likely case that this service account can not access Cromwell's default google bucket, the `gcp_batch_gcs_root` workflow option should be set appropriately.

Due to this limitation, it is important that all users of this Cromwell server be trusted. . With the exception of the use of the `google_compute_service_account` scheme in the [Configuration](Configuring#authentication) for the [Google Cloud backend](backends/Google)), Cromwell servers are setup to access files for use in workflows using a single set of credentials.

The `refresh_token` or `google_compute_service_account` scheme is the only way to ensure data is protected among multiple users of a Cromwell server, however the aforementioned caveats of authorization for endpoints still applies. . **Protecting Secrets**. Various parts of the Cromwell server [Configuration](Configuring) contain sensitive information, e.g. username and password for your persistent database.

When choosing the image version for your pipeline stages, it is highly recommended that you use a hash rather than a tag, for the sake of reproducibility; For example, in WDL, you could do this:; ```wdl; runtime {; docker: 'ubuntu:latest'; }; ```. But what you should do is this:; ```wdl; runtime {; docker: 'ubuntu@sha256:7a47ccc3bbe8a451b500d2b53104868b46d60ee8f5b35a24b41a86077c650210'; }; ```. You can find the `sha256` of an image using `docker images --digests`; ; ; ### Notes. #### How does Cromwell know when a job or container has completed?; Cromwell uses the presence of the `rc` (returncode) file to determine whether a task has succeeded or failed. This `rc` file is generated as part of the `script` within the execution directory, where the script is assembled at runtime. This is important as if the script executes successfully but the container doesn't terminate, Cromwell will continue the execution of the workflow and the container will persist hogging system resources. Within the configurations above:; - `singularity`: The exec mode does not run a container on the background. #### Cromwell: Run-in-",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md:19349,hash,hash,19349,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md,2,['hash'],['hash']

All backends can now emit slow job warnings after a configurable time running.; NB This example shows how to configure this setting for the PAPIv2 backend:; ```conf; # Emit a warning if jobs last longer than this amount of time. This might indicate that something got stuck.; backend {; providers {; PAPIv2 {; config {; slow-job-warning-time: 24 hours; }; }; }; }; ```. ### Runtime Attributes. #### GPU Attributes. * The `gpuType` attribute is no longer validated against a whitelist at workflow submission time. Instead, validation now happens at runtime. This allows any valid accelerator to be used.; * The `nvidiaDriverVersion` attribute is now available in WDL `runtime` sections. The default continues to be `390.46` which applies if and only if GPUs are being used.; * A default `gpuType` (""nvidia-tesla-k80"") will now be applied if `gpuCount` is specified but `gpuType` is not.; * Similarly, a default `gpuCount` (1) will be applied if `gpuType` is specified but `cpuCount` is not. ### Bug fixes. #### Better validation of workflow heartbeats.

The following is the toolchain used for development of womtool. Other versions may work, but these are recommended. * [Scala 2.13](http://www.scala-lang.org/); * [SBT 1.x](https://www.scala-sbt.org/); * [AdoptOpenJDK 11 HotSpot](https://adoptopenjdk.net/); * [Git](https://git-scm.com/). ## Building. `sbt assembly` will build a runnable JAR in `womtool/target/scala-2.13/`. Tests are run via `sbt test`. Note that the tests do require Docker to be running. To test this out while downloading the Ubuntu image that is required for tests, run `docker pull ubuntu:latest` prior to running `sbt test`. ## Command Line Usage.

Security,"tutorials/PipelinesApi101) for instructions common to all authentication modes; and detailed instructions for the application default authentication scheme in particular.; The instructions below assume you have created a Google Cloud Storage bucket and a Google project enabled for the appropriate APIs. **Configuring Authentication**. The `google` stanza in the Cromwell configuration file defines how to authenticate to Google. There are four different; authentication schemes that might be used:. * `application_default` (default, recommended) - Use [application default](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials) credentials.; * `service_account` - Use a specific service account and key file (in PEM format) to authenticate.; * `user_account` - Authenticate as a user.; * `user_service_account` - Authenticate each individual workflow using service account credentials supplied in the workflow options. The `auths` block in the `google` stanza defines the authentication schemes within a Cromwell deployment:. ```hocon; google {; application-name = ""cromwell""; auths = [; {; name = ""application-default""; scheme = ""application_default""; },; {; name = ""service-account""; scheme = ""service_account""; service-account-id = ""my-service-account""; pem-file = ""/path/to/file.pem""; },; {; name = ""user-service-account""; scheme = ""user_service_account""; }; ]; }; ```. These authentication schemes can be referenced by name within other portions of the configuration file. For example, both; the `genomics` and `filesystems.gcs` sections within a Google configuration block must reference an auth defined in this block.; The auth for the `genomics` section governs the interactions with Google itself, while `filesystems.gcs` governs the localization; of data into and out of GCE VMs. **Application Default Credentials**. By default, application default credentials will be used. Only `name` and `scheme` are required for application default credentials.

For this reason, this tutorial will also explore other technologies that support the reproducibility and simplicity of running a workflow that use docker containers; Singularity and udocker. ___. ### Singularity. Singularity is a container technology designed for use on HPC systems in particular, while ensuring an appropriate level of security that Docker cannot provide. #### Installation; Before you can configure Cromwell on your HPC system, you will have to install Singularity, which is documented [here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/admin-guide/admin_quickstart.html#installation).; In order to gain access to the full set of features in Singularity, it is strongly recommended that Singularity is installed by root, with the `setuid` bit enabled, as is ([documented here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/2.6/admin-guide/security.html#how-does-singularity-do-it)).; This likely means that you will have to ask your sysadmin to install it for you.; Because `singularity` ideally needs `setuid`, your admins may have some qualms about giving Singularity this privilege.; If that is the case, you might consider forwarding [this letter](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html#singularity-on-a-shared-resource) to your admins. If you are not able to get Singularity installed with these privileges, you can attempt a user install.; If this is the case, you will have to alter your Cromwell configuration to work in ""sandbox"" mode, which is explained in [this part](#without-setuid) of the documentation. . #### Configuring Cromwell for Singularity. Once Singularity is installed, you'll need to modify the `config` block inside `backend.providers` in your Cromwell configuration. In particular, this block contains a key called `submit-docker`, which will contain a script that is run whenever a job ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md:4810,secur,security,4810,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md,2,['secur'],['security']

Some configuration changes were introduced in Cromwell 67 to support improved scaling. See Cromwell's `reference.conf` for details on new parameters. * I/O throttling moved from `io` to its own `io.throttle` stanza; config updates may be required if these values are currently being overridden in local deployments. * The default `system.job-rate-control` has been changed from 50 per second to 20 per 10 seconds. * New configuration parameters have been introduced for values which were previously hardcoded constants:; * `system.file-hash-batch-size`, value updated from `100` to `50`.; * `io.gcs.max-batch-size`, value stays the same at `100`.; * `io.gcs.max-batch-duration`, value stays the same at `5 seconds`. * New configuration parameters which should not require updating:; * `io.command-backpressure-staleness`; * `io.backpressure-extension-log-threshold`; * `load-control.io-normal-window-minimum`; * `load-control.io-normal-window-maximum`. * `io.nio.parallelism` was previously misspelled in `reference.conf` but not in Cromwell's configuration reading code. Only correct spellings of this configuration key had or will have effect. ## 66 Release Notes. ### Google Artifact Registry Support; Cromwell now supports call caching when using Docker images hosted on; [Google Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry). ### Google Image Repository Hashing Updates; The previously documented `docker.hash-lookup.gcr` configuration has been renamed to `docker.hash-lookup.google` and; now applies to both Google Container Registry (G",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:22941,hash,hash-batch-size,22941,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['hash'],['hash-batch-size']

However if the call is attempted multiple times (because it has been preempted for example),; since hash values are strictly identical for all attempts, they will only be published in the last attempt section of the metadata for this call.; If the hashes fail to be calculated, the reason is indicated in a `hashFailures` field in the `callCaching` section of the call metadata.; *Important*: Hashes are not retroactively published to the metadata. Which means only workflows run on Cromwell 28+ will have hashes in their metadata. See the [README](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell#get-apiworkflowsversionidmetadata) for an example metadata response. * New endpoint returning the hash differential for 2 calls. `GET /api/workflows/:version/callcaching/diff`.

Cromwell is conceptually divided in an engine part and a backend part. One Cromwell instance corresponds to an ""engine"" but can have multiple backends configured.; The `engine.filesystems` section configures filesystems that Cromwell can use when it needs to interact with files outside of the context of a backend.

This workflow is valid WDL and does not involve any backend, or even a task.

Security,"workflow submitted. ### Bug Fixes. * Fixed a bug on Google Pipelines API backends where missing optional output files (`File?`) were not correctly detected by Cromwell and caused invalid call cache entries to be written. ## 73 Release Notes. ### Workflow Restart Performance Improvements. Cromwell now allows for improved performance restarting large workflows through the use of a separate rate limiter for restart checks than the rate limiter used for starting new jobs.; The restart check rate limiter is pre-configured in Cromwell's bundled [reference.conf](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/core/src/main/resources/reference.conf); see the `job-restart-check-rate-control` stanza in that file for explanations of the various parameters if adjustments are desired. ## 71 Release Notes. ### Bug Fixes. * Fixed an issue handling data in Google Cloud Storage buckets with requester pays enabled that could sometimes cause I/O to fail. ## 70 Release Notes. ### CWL security fix [#6510](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6510). Fixed an issue that could allow submission of an untrusted CWL file to initiate remote code execution. The vector was improper deserialization of the YAML source file. CWL execution is enabled by default unless a `CWL` [stanza](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/core/src/main/resources/reference.conf#L460-L482) is present in the configuration that specifies `enabled: false`. Cromwell instances with CWL disabled were not affected. Consequently, users who wish to mitigate the vulnerability without upgrading Cromwell may do so via this config change. - Thank you to [Bruno P. Kinoshita](https://github.com/kinow) who first found the issue in a different CWL project ([CVE-2021-41110](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer/security/advisories/GHSA-7g7j-f5g3-fqp7)) and [Michael R.

Security,"y in Cromwell configuration files and code. This section offers detailed configuration instructions for using Cromwell with the Pipelines API in all supported; authentication modes. Before reading futher in this section please see the; [Getting started on Google Pipelines API](../tutorials/PipelinesApi101) for instructions common to all authentication modes; and detailed instructions for the application default authentication scheme in particular.; The instructions below assume you have created a Google Cloud Storage bucket and a Google project enabled for the appropriate APIs. **Configuring Authentication**. The `google` stanza in the Cromwell configuration file defines how to authenticate to Google. There are four different; authentication schemes that might be used:. * `application_default` (default, recommended) - Use [application default](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials) credentials.; * `service_account` - Use a specific service account and key file (in PEM format) to authenticate.; * `user_account` - Authenticate as a user.; * `user_service_account` - Authenticate each individual workflow using service account credentials supplied in the workflow options. The `auths` block in the `google` stanza defines the authentication schemes within a Cromwell deployment:. ```hocon; google {; application-name = ""cromwell""; auths = [; {; name = ""application-default""; scheme = ""application_default""; },; {; name = ""service-account""; scheme = ""service_account""; service-account-id = ""my-service-account""; pem-file = ""/path/to/file.pem""; },; {; name = ""user-service-account""; scheme = ""user_service_account""; }; ]; }; ```. These authentication schemes can be referenced by name within other portions of the configuration file.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a popular container technology that is natively supported by Cromwell and WDL. #### Docker on a Local Backend. On a single machine (laptop or server), no extra configuration is needed to allow docker to run, provided Docker is installed. You can install Docker for Linux, Mac or Windows from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community). #### Docker on Cloud. It is strongly advised that you provide a Docker image to tasks that will run on Cloud backends, and in fact most Cloud providers require it. It might be possible to use an alternative container engine, but this is not recommended if Docker is supported. #### Docker on HPC. Docker can allow running users to gain superuser privileges, called the [Docker daemon attack surface](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface). In HPC and multi-user environments, Docker recommends that ""only trusted users should be allowed to control your Docker Daemon"". For this reason, this tutorial will also explore other technologies that support the reproducibility and simplicity of running a workflow that use docker containers; Singularity and udocker. ___. ### Singularity. Singularity is a container technology designed for use on HPC systems in particular, while ensuring an appropriate level of security that Docker cannot provide. #### Installation; Before you can configure Cromwell on your HPC system, you will have to install Singularity, which is documented [here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/admin-guide/admin_quickstart.html#installation).; In order to gain access to the full set of features in Singularity, it is strongly recommended that Singularity is installed by root, with the `setuid` bit enabled, as is ([documented here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/2.6/admin-guide/security.h",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md:3801,secur,security,3801,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md,6,"['attack', 'secur']","['attack-surface', 'security']"
Testability," In the simplest example these values would be; identical, living on a shared filesystem. However an example of where this would be useful would be a model where an; input file lives in a cloud bucket and is directly copied onto the machine running the command line followed by copying; the program’s outputs back to a cloud bucket. The underlying platform can be extremely simple or have arbitrary levels of complexity as long as one can map from the; above concepts to running a command. That mapping could happen completely in the platform, the Cromwell backend, or a; mixture of the two. The implementer of a backend will need to strike the balance which works best for both their needs; and the particulars of the platform itself. Throughout the rest of this document the following terms are used, the difference between them may be subtle but; important:. * Workflow: a container of one or more calls, possibly expressing execution dependencies on each other. May contain; scatters, conditional logic, or subworkflow invocations.; * Task: The abstract definition of a thing to run. Think of this like a function in a programming language.; * Call: An instantiated request in Cromwell of a thing to run. To further the function analogy this would be an; invocation of that function.; * Job: The physical manifestation of a call by the backend. Examples of this would be an SGE job, a unix process, or a; Google Life Sciences operation ID. ### Backend Lifecycle. Within a running workflow, the backend is used in the following manner:. * Initialization: Initialization routine called the first time a workflow uses a backend; * Execute: The workflow requests that the backend run a job; * Recover: Attempt to reconnect to a previously started job. An example of this would be if Cromwell was restarted and; wanted to reattach to currently running jobs.; * Abort: Request that a running job be halted; * Finalization: When a workflow is complete, allows for any workflow level cleanup to take plac",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/Backend.md:2725,log,logic,2725,docs/developers/Backend.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/Backend.md,1,['log'],['logic']

There are two ways to invoke the integration tests:. * `sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / test""` - compiles Centaur and runs all tests via sbt directly. Tests are expected to be in the `centaur/src/main/standardTestCases` directory. This can be changed by modifying `reference.conf`. * `src/ci/bin/testCentaurLocal.sh` - runs the same tests using the continuous integration pipeline configuration. * Tests that require different Cromwell and Centaur configurations can be invoked by calling the various scripts in `src/ci/bin`. ### Tags. All tests are tagged with their name and their TESTFORMAT, and also any custom tags specified in the `.test` file. Tag names are all lower case, so a test named ""tagFoo"" has a tag ""tagfoo"". To run only those tests which have been tagged with a specified tag `tagFoo`:; ```; sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / testOnly * -- -n tagfoo""; ```. Or to instead exclude all tests which have been tagged with a specified tag `tagFoo`:; ```; sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / testOnly * -- -l tagfoo""; ```. ## Adding custom tests. You can add your own tests to the test suite by adding `-Dcentaur.optionalTestPath=DIR` on your sbt invocation, ; e.g. `sbt -Dcentaur.optionalTestPath=/some/path/to/tests test`. The value of `DIR` is expected to be a directory; which contains one or more test case files.; ; The same result can be achieved more permanently by adding the custom directory into the `application.conf` file directly: ; ```; centaur {; optionalTestPath = ""/some/path/to/tests""; }; ```. ## Defining test cases.

Testability," a further optimization the PAPI backend has the concept of ""this"" bucket on a per-workflow basis, where ""this"" bucket is; the bucket that contains the current workflow root.; If `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` is specified in ; workflow options on the PAPI backend, Cromwell will automatically prepend ""this"" bucket to the call cache hit path prefixes to search.; For example, if Charles specified the same workflow options as in the example above and his workflow root was under `gs://charles_bucket`,; Cromwell would search cache hits in all of the `gs://alice_bucket`, `gs://bob_bucket` and `gs://charles_bucket` buckets without having to specify; `gs://charles_bucket` bucket explicitly in `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes`. If no `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` are specified then all matching cache hits will be considered. ***Call cache failure logging***. When Cromwell fails to cache a job from a previous result the reason will be logged. To reduce the verbosity of the logs; only the first three failure reasons will be logged per shard of each job. Cromwell will continue to try copying; previous results for the call, and when no candidates are left Cromwell will run the job on the backend. **Docker Tags**. Certain Docker tags can impact call caching performance. ; Docker tags are a convenient way to point to a version of an image (`ubuntu:14.04`), or even the latest version (`ubuntu:latest`).; For that purpose, tags are mutable, meaning that the image they point to can change, while the tag name stays the same.; While this is very convenient in some cases, using mutable, or ""floating"" tags in tasks affects the reproducibility of a workflow. ; If you were to run the same workflow using `ubuntu:latest` now, and again in a year (or even in a month) may run with different docker images.; This has an even bigger impact when Call Caching is turned on in Cromwell, and could lead to unpredictable behaviors if a tag is updated in the middle of a workflow or even a scatter for exampl",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md:7970,log,logs,7970,docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,2,['log'],"['logged', 'logs']"

Once the job is Submitted in AWS Batch, one of the EC2 instances assigned; to the compute environment (a.k.a. ECS Cluster) with a running agent will; pick up the Cromwell Job/AWS Batch Job/ECS Task and run it. Importantly,; AWS Batch calls ECS' `RunTask` API when submitting the job. It uses the; task definition, and overrides both the command text and the environment; variables. Input files are read into the container from S3 and output files are copied back to; S3. Three additional files are also written to the S3 bucket using the names of these; environment variables:. * AWS_CROMWELL_RC_FILE (the return code of the task); * AWS_CROMWELL_STDOUT_FILE (STDOUT of the task); * AWS_CROMWELL_STDERR_FILE (STDERR of the task). These files are placed in the correct location in S3 after task execution. In addition; STDOUT and STDERR are fed to the tasks cloudwatch log.

We might add or remove metrics in the future depending on need and usage.; These are the current high level categories:. * `backend`; * `rest-api`; * `job`; * `workflow`; * `io`. ### Stackdriver. Cromwell now supports sending metrics to [Google's Stackdriver API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/). To use the Stackdriver instrumentation; specify this in your config:; ```hocon; services.Instrumentation {; class = ""cromwell.services.instrumentation.impl.stackdriver.StackdriverInstrumentationServiceActor"". config {; # auth scheme can be `application_default` or `service_account`; auth = ""service-account""; google-project = ""my-project""; # rate at which aggregated metrics will be sent to Stackdriver. It needs to be equal or greater than 1 minute.; # Google's Stackdriver API needs each metric to be sent not more than once per minute.; flush-rate = 1 minute; # below 3 keys are attached as labels to each metric. `cromwell-perf-test-case` is specifically meant for perf env.; cromwell-instance-role = ""role""; cromwell-perf-test-case = ""perf-test-1""; }; }; ```; The 2 label keys are optional. If specified, each metric will have label(s) added in the form of a (key, value) pair.; So for example, if `cromwell-instance-role = ""backend""` is mentioned in config, each metric data point sent to Stackdriver; will have a label (cromwell_instance_role, backend) added to it. There is another optional label that can be added to each metric. `cromwell_id` represents the identifier for different Cromwell instances.; ```hocon; # Unique Cromwell instance identifier; system.cromwell_id = ""cromwell-instance-1""; ```. ##### Metric type and Label keys naming convention; More details on the this can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/metrics-details#metric-kinds).

Testability," mode for server is `standard`, while the default when running a single worklow is `pretty`. You can explicitly specify the format by running cromwell with:. ```bash; java -DLOG_MODE=pretty -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. ### Log Level. By default, Cromwell outputs messages at a `LOG_LEVEL` of `INFO`. Sometimes, you may want more or less information logged. For example, while debugging an issue you may want to increase the amount information in the logs temporarily. Alternatively, the standard level may be too verbose, and you may only want Cromwell to log warnings and errors. You can set the level via the property `LOG_LEVEL` to any one of the values: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, or `OFF`. The default log level is `INFO`. ```bash; java -DLOG_LEVEL=DEBUG -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. ## Workflow Logs. While a workflow is running, Cromwell generates a log file specifically for the workflow. After the workflow completes, to clear up local disk space, Cromwell deletes the local copy of this log file. See the [Configuration](Configuring#workflow-log-directory) section on logs for more information on preventing cromwell from deleting each workflow log. Before Cromwell deletes the files and before the workflow completes, you can configure Cromwell to copy the workflow; logs to various locations. Normally, you'll want to copy the log to a remote bucket or directory. To specify the remote; directory to copy the logs to, use the separate [Workflow Option](wf_options/Overview#output-copying); `final_workflow_log_dir`. ## Call Logs. As each call in a workflow runs, it generates output to the standard output and standard error. This output is stored per call in call log files.

Testability," phase; * Reference resolution between WDLOM elements occurs during the linking phase. ; * WDLOM `ExpressionElement`s are wrapped into `WdlomWomExpression`s during the graph building phase. During the graph construction phase static expression elements are mixed together with evaluation functions; to produce the final WOM expressions, and any differences between language versions are baked in. . #### Where evaluation functions are coded. The four evaluators types described in ""Expressions in WOM"" are coded in four package objects for each version. They live in:. * WDL `version 1.0`: [`wdl/transforms/draft3/src/main/scala/wdl/draft3/transforms/linking/expression`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/develop/wdl/transforms/draft3/src/main/scala/wdl/draft3/transforms/linking/expression); * WDL `version development`: [`wdl/transforms/biscayne/src/main/scala/wdl/transforms/biscayne/linking/expression`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/develop/wdl/transforms/biscayne/src/test/scala/wdl/transforms/biscayne/linking/expression). These evaluators are really just long pattern matches from various WDLOM element types to the relevant evaluator for that element. Because the evaluations are largely the same for now between WDL versions, you'll notice that the imported evaluators mostly come from files ; in [`wdl.transforms.base.linking.expression`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/develop/wdl/transforms/new-base/src/main/scala/wdl/transforms/base/linking/expression). However, in WDL development, there are a number of imported functions from biscayne-specific directories.; If future WDL versions diverge more starkly from the 1.0 base, it is likely that the imports into these pattern match evaluators will come from a; wider variety of origins. #### How Evaluation Functions Build WOM Expressions.

Testability,"# IoActor: basic concepts. * **Word count:** 225. ## Actor Hierarchy. IO subsystem consists of the following actors. ![IoActor hierarchy](IoActor_basic_hierarchy.png). All messages are sent to `IoActorProxy`, which then routes them either to `IoActor` or `IoPromiseProxyActor` based on ; whether the message contains a Promise. `IoPromiseProxyActor` receives a message with Promise, forwards message to the ; `IoActor`, and once response from `IoActor` comes back, completes the promise. `IoActor` has back-pressure (always enabled) and throttling (configurable) features implemented in order to prevent ; overflowing the incoming messages queue. ## Message types and processing logic. `IoActor` accepts messages of base type `IoCommand[T]` with or without clientContext (which is a Promise, which will be ; passed through, back to the `IoPromiseProxyActor` in the end). Message processing logic is implemented using Akka Stream API and can be represented with the following graph:; ![IoActor message processing graph](IoActor_message_processing_graph.png). There are 2 message processing flows: ; 1. ""GCS batch flow"" to process messages, which are subtypes of `GcsBatchIoCommand` ; 1.

Testability,"## Logging Properties. ### Setting Logging Properties. Cromwell accepts two properties for controlling logging. You can set these properties via a Java system property on the command line using `-D`:. ```bash; $ java -DLOG_LEVEL=DEBUG -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. Alternatively, you can also set the log level via an environment variable:. ```bash; export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG; java -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. *If you set same property via a system property, and an environment variable, the system property overrides the environment variable.*. ### Log Format. Cromwell outputs log in one of two formats, either `pretty` or `standard`. You can change the format of the logs by setting the property to `LOG_MODE`. * In `standard` mode, your logs will be written without ANSI escape code coloring, with a layout more appropriate for server logs. * In `pretty` mode, your logs are output in a colorful, easier to read format, more appropriate for a single workflow run. The default mode for server is `standard`, while the default when running a single worklow is `pretty`. You can explicitly specify the format by running cromwell with:. ```bash; java -DLOG_MODE=pretty -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. ### Log Level. By default, Cromwell outputs messages at a `LOG_LEVEL` of `INFO`. Sometimes, you may want more or less information logged. For example, while debugging an issue you may want to increase the amount information in the logs temporarily. Alternatively, the standard level may be too verbose, and you may only want Cromwell to log warnings and errors. You can set the level via the property `LOG_LEVEL` to any one of the values: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, or `OFF`. The default log level is `INFO`. ```bash; java -DLOG_LEVEL=DEBUG -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. ## Workflow Logs. While a workflow is running, Cromwell generates a log file specifically for the workflow. After the workflow completes, to clear up local disk space, Cromwell deletes the local copy of this log ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Logging.md:103,log,logging,103,docs/Logging.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Logging.md,7,['log'],"['log', 'logging', 'logs']"

Users reported cases where Life Sciences jobs failed due to insufficient quota, instead of queueing and waiting until; quota is available (which is the expected behavior). Cromwell will now retry under these conditions, which present with errors; such as ""PAPI error code 9"", ""no available zones"", and/or ""quota too low"". ### Database. #### New table 'GROUP_METRICS_ENTRY'. A new table called `GROUP_METRICS_ENTRY` has been added. The purpose of this table is to track when a group or billing project last ran into Cloud Quota exhaustion. #### Index removal. The `IX_WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY_WS` index is removed from `WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY`.

Testability,", Centaur will retrieve the metadata from the successfully completed workflow and compare the values retrieved to those supplied. At the moment the only fields supported are strings, numbers and booleans. You can find which metadata is recorded by running a workflow ```java -jar <Cromwell JAR> run -m metadata.json my_workflow.wdl```.; This will save the metadata in `metadata.json`. For any metadata values or outputExpectations which require workflow ID (i.e, file paths), use `<<UUID>>` as a placeholder instead. For example:; * `""calls.hello.hello.stdout"": ""gs://google-project/jes/root/wdl/<<UUID>>/call-task/task-stdout.log""`. In case the absolute path the cromwell root is used (for example: `/home/my_user/projects/cromwell/cromwell-executions`); you can use `<<WORKFLOW_ROOT>>` as a replacement. ; * `""calls.hello.hello.exit_code"": ""<<WORKFLOW_ROOT>>/call-hello/execution/exit_code""`. In case testing of the caching is required `<<CACHE_HIT_UUID>>` can be used. ; The testFormat should be `runtwiceexpectingcallcaching`. ## Centaur Test Types; Both Cromwell and Centaur require configuration files in order to correctly build and test various parts of the system.

Testability,"-c conda-forge cromwell` or a separate environment for Cromwell can be created with ; `conda create -n cromwell cromwell` (be sure to activate the conda-forge channel first). ; If you are using Cromwell for bioinformatics workflows, you might like to take; a look at [bioconda](http://bioconda.github.io) as well. ; The conda installation of Cromwell comes with a wrapper that locates the jar for you and allows for running Cromwell or Womtool with a ; `cromwell run`, `womtool validate` or other command. Conda also installs the required Java dependency ; in the environment automatically. Mac users with Homebrew can also get Cromwell with the command `brew install cromwell`. This documentation frequently refers to a ""Cromwell jar"" with a name like `cromwell-<version>.jar`. ; This is the main artifact in Cromwell releases that contains all executable Cromwell code and default configuration. . A distribution of Java 17 is required to run Cromwell. Cromwell is developed, tested, and containerized using; [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17). For users running a Cromwell server [a docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/broadinstitute/cromwell) has been made available. ### Apple Silicon support statement (updated 2020-11-17). #### Cromwell JAR works out of the box. The Cromwell JAR works on any standard Java installation. A user can install an x86 Java runtime on an Apple Silicon Mac and the Rosetta 2 translation layer runs Cromwell at near-native speed. Once natively-compiled Java runtimes become available, performance will increase with no change in functionality. . #### Docker Desktop support is in progress.

We can now run this workflow. ```wdl; version 1.0. workflow my_workflow {; String s = read_string(""gs://mybucket/my_file.txt""); output {; String out = s; }; }; ```. #### Default ""engine"" Filesystems. If you don't change anything in your own configuration file, the following default is inherited from `reference.conf`:; ```; engine {; filesystems {; local {; enabled: true; }; http {; enabled: true; }; }; }; ```. **Note**: since our configuration files are HOCON, to disable filesystems you *must* add `enabled: false` into your ; overriding configuration file. It is **not** sufficient to simply omit a filesystem from your stanza. . For example: adding this to your configuration file will remove the `http` filesystem and leave `local` for use in the ; engine:; ```; engine {; filesystems {; http {; enabled: false; }; }; }; ```. Whereas this example will leave `http` unchanged and merely re-assert the default enabling of `local`. In other; words, **this will do nothing**:; ```; engine {; filesystems {; local {; enabled: true; }; }; }; ```. ### Backend Filesystems. Similarly to the engine, you can also configure backend filesystems individually. Some backends might require the use of a specific filesystem.; For example, the [Pipelines API](../tutorials/PipelinesApi101.md) backend requires Google Cloud Storage.; Let's take another example:. ```wdl; version 1.0. task my_pipelines_task {; input {; File input_file; }; String content = read_string(input_file); ; command {; echo ~{content}; }; ; runtime {; docker: ""ubuntu""; }; }; workflow my_workflow {; call my_pipelines_task { input: input_file = ""gs://mybucket/my_file.txt"" }; }; ```. Suppose this workflow is submitted to a Cromwell running a Pipelines API backend. This time the `read_string` function is in the context of a task run by the backend.; The filesystem configuration used will be the one in the `config` s",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/Filesystems.md:4824,assert,assert,4824,docs/filesystems/Filesystems.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/Filesystems.md,1,['assert'],['assert']
Testability,"-workflow will only be valid if those outputs are exposed in the workflow output section. Sub-workflows are executed in the context of a main workflow, which means that operations that are normally executed once per workflow (set up, clean up, outputs copying, log copying, etc...); will NOT be re-executed for each sub-workflow. For instance if a resource is created during workflow initialization, sub-workflows will need to share this same resource.; Workflow outputs will be copied for the main root workflow but not for intermediate sub-workflows. Restarts, aborts, and call-caching work exactly as they would with tasks. ; All tasks run by a sub-workflow are eligible for call caching under the same rules as any other task.; However, workflows themselves are not cached as such. Which means that running the exact same workflow twice with call caching on will trigger each task to cache individually,; but not the workflow itself. The root path for sub-workflow execution files (scripts, output files, logs) will be under the parent workflow call directory.; For example, the execution directory for the above main workflow would look like the following:. ```; cromwell-executions/main_workflow/1d919bd4-d046-43b0-9918-9964509689dd/ <- main workflow id; └── call-hello_and_goodbye <- call directory for call hello_and_goodbye in the main workflow; └── hello_and_goodbye <- name of the sub-workflow ; └── a6365f91-c807-465a-9186-a5d3da98fe11 <- sub-workflow id; ├── call-goodbye; │ └── execution; │ ├── rc; │ ├── script; │ ├── script.background; │ ├── script.submit; │ ├── stderr; │ ├── stderr.background; │ ├── stdout; │ └── stdout.background; └── call-hello; └── execution; ├── rc; ├── script; ├── script.background; ├── script.submit; ├── stderr; ├── stderr.background; ├── stdout; └── stdout.background. ```. **Metadata**.

Confirm that [the Homebrew package](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cromwell) was updated. ## Bonus Processes. The Swagger client library is not part of our core publish/release process but can be performed from time to time, as required. ### How to Generate and Publish Swagger Client Library. **Note:** This part of publishing may or may not work for you until; [BT-38](https://broadworkbench.atlassian.net/browse/BT-38) is finished and this section is updated. The first step is to generate the client library. From the root of the repo run. ```; ./scripts/gen_java_client.sh; ```. This generates the client library and runs the generated tests as well. A successful run should end with something similar to. ```; [debug] Test run finished: 0 failed, 0 ignored, 7 total, 0.007s; [info] Passed: Total 103, Failed 0, Errors 0, Passed 100, Skipped 3; [success] Total time: 4 s, completed Jun 26, 2019 3:01:19 PM; ```. To publish to artifactory, first obtain the artifactory username and credentials. Credentials are located in Vault at path `secret/dsde/cromwell/common/cromwell-artifactory`. Then run. ```; export ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME=<the-username>; export ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD=<the-password>; ./scripts/publish-client.sh; ```. A SNAP version of the client library will be published in jFrog at [this path](https://broadinstitute.jfrog.io/ui/repos/tree/General/libs-release-local/org/broadinstitute/cromwell). ## Cromwell setup for publishing.

If you want multiple database users to be able to read Cromwell's data from a Postgresql database, you'll need to create a; role that all relevant users have access to, and adjust Cromwell to use this role. This is because each Large Object is owned; by, and only readable by, the role that wrote it. First, pass these options when executing Cromwell. They will ensure that Cromwell's database tables are ; owned by the role, not the initial login user.; * `-DengineSharedCromwellDbRole=your_role` to control the role that owns the engine tables; * `-DsharedCromwellDbRole=your_role` to control the role that owns the metadata tables. Next, use the config key `pgLargeObjectWriteRole` to set the role that should own all large objects, as shown below. ; This config will have no effect if you aren't using Postgresql. The configured login user can be any user that is; granted the shared role. ```hocon; database {; profile = ""slick.jdbc.PostgresProfile$""; pgLargeObjectWriteRole = ""your_role""; db {; driver = ""org.postgresql.Driver""; url = ""jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/cromwell""; user = ""user""; password = ""pass""; port = 5432; connectionTimeout = 5000; }; }; ```. **Using Cromwell with file-based database (No server required)**.

Cromwell outputs log in one of two formats, either `pretty` or `standard`. You can change the format of the logs by setting the property to `LOG_MODE`. * In `standard` mode, your logs will be written without ANSI escape code coloring, with a layout more appropriate for server logs. * In `pretty` mode, your logs are output in a colorful, easier to read format, more appropriate for a single workflow run. The default mode for server is `standard`, while the default when running a single worklow is `pretty`. You can explicitly specify the format by running cromwell with:. ```bash; java -DLOG_MODE=pretty -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. ### Log Level. By default, Cromwell outputs messages at a `LOG_LEVEL` of `INFO`. Sometimes, you may want more or less information logged. For example, while debugging an issue you may want to increase the amount information in the logs temporarily. Alternatively, the standard level may be too verbose, and you may only want Cromwell to log warnings and errors. You can set the level via the property `LOG_LEVEL` to any one of the values: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, or `OFF`. The default log level is `INFO`. ```bash; java -DLOG_LEVEL=DEBUG -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. ## Workflow Logs. While a workflow is running, Cromwell generates a log file specifically for the workflow. After the workflow completes, to clear up local disk space, Cromwell deletes the local copy of this log file. See the [Configuration](Configuring#workflow-log-directory) section on logs for more information on preventing cromwell from deleting each workflow log. Before Cromwell deletes the files and before the workflow completes, you can configure Cromwell to copy the workflow; logs to various locations.

Other versions may work, but these are recommended. * [Scala 2.13](http://www.scala-lang.org/); * [SBT 1.x](https://www.scala-sbt.org/); * [AdoptOpenJDK 11 HotSpot](https://adoptopenjdk.net/); * [Git](https://git-scm.com/). ## Building. `sbt assembly` will build a runnable JAR in `womtool/target/scala-2.13/`. Tests are run via `sbt test`. Note that the tests do require Docker to be running. To test this out while downloading the Ubuntu image that is required for tests, run `docker pull ubuntu:latest` prior to running `sbt test`. ## Command Line Usage. Run the JAR file with no arguments to get the usage message:. `$ java -jar womtool.jar`. ```bash; java -jar /path/to/womtool.jar <action> <parameters>. Actions:; validate [--list-dependencies] <WDL file>.

Testability,"MODE`. * In `standard` mode, your logs will be written without ANSI escape code coloring, with a layout more appropriate for server logs. * In `pretty` mode, your logs are output in a colorful, easier to read format, more appropriate for a single workflow run. The default mode for server is `standard`, while the default when running a single worklow is `pretty`. You can explicitly specify the format by running cromwell with:. ```bash; java -DLOG_MODE=pretty -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. ### Log Level. By default, Cromwell outputs messages at a `LOG_LEVEL` of `INFO`. Sometimes, you may want more or less information logged. For example, while debugging an issue you may want to increase the amount information in the logs temporarily. Alternatively, the standard level may be too verbose, and you may only want Cromwell to log warnings and errors. You can set the level via the property `LOG_LEVEL` to any one of the values: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, or `OFF`. The default log level is `INFO`. ```bash; java -DLOG_LEVEL=DEBUG -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. ## Workflow Logs. While a workflow is running, Cromwell generates a log file specifically for the workflow. After the workflow completes, to clear up local disk space, Cromwell deletes the local copy of this log file.

Confirm that [the Homebrew package](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cromwell) was updated. ## Bonus Processes. The Swagger client library is not part of our core publish/release process but can be performed from time to time, as required. ### How to Generate and Publish Swagger Client Library. **Note:** This part of publishing may or may not work for you until; [BT-38](https://broadworkbench.atlassian.net/browse/BT-38) is finished and this section is updated. The first step is to generate the client library. From the root of the repo run. ```; ./scripts/gen_java_client.sh; ```. This generates the client library and runs the generated tests as well. A successful run should end with something similar to. ```; [debug] Test run finished: 0 failed, 0 ignored, 7 total, 0.007s; [info] Passed: Total 103, Failed 0, Errors 0, Passed 100, Skipped 3; [success] Total time: 4 s, completed Jun 26, 2019 3:01:19 PM; ```. To publish to artifactory, first obtain the artifactory username and credentials. Credentials are located in Vault at path `secret/dsde/cromwell/common/cromwell-artifactory`. Then run. ```; export ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME=<the-username>; export ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD=<the-password>; ./scripts/publish-client.sh; ```. A SNAP version of the client library will be published in jFrog at [this path](https://broadinstitute.jfrog.io/ui/repos/tree/General/libs-release-local/org/broadinstitute/cromwell). ## Cromwell setup for publishing.

All tests are tagged with their name and their TESTFORMAT, and also any custom tags specified in the `.test` file. Tag names are all lower case, so a test named ""tagFoo"" has a tag ""tagfoo"". To run only those tests which have been tagged with a specified tag `tagFoo`:; ```; sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / testOnly * -- -n tagfoo""; ```. Or to instead exclude all tests which have been tagged with a specified tag `tagFoo`:; ```; sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / testOnly * -- -l tagfoo""; ```. ## Adding custom tests. You can add your own tests to the test suite by adding `-Dcentaur.optionalTestPath=DIR` on your sbt invocation, ; e.g. `sbt -Dcentaur.optionalTestPath=/some/path/to/tests test`. The value of `DIR` is expected to be a directory; which contains one or more test case files.; ; The same result can be achieved more permanently by adding the custom directory into the `application.conf` file directly: ; ```; centaur {; optionalTestPath = ""/some/path/to/tests""; }; ```. ## Defining test cases. Each test case file is a HOCON file with the following structure:; ```; name: NAME // Required: Name of the test; testFormat: TESTFORMAT // Required: One of WorkflowSuccessTest, WorkflowFailureTest, runtwiceexpectingcallcaching; backends: [BACKENDNAME1, BACKENDNAME2, ...] // Optional list of backends.

Its purpose is to exercise the functionality of a specific deployment of Cromwell, to ensure that it is functioning properly 'in the wild'. . ## Prerequisites. Centaur expects to find a Cromwell server properly configured and running in server mode, listening on port 8000. ; This can be configured by modifying the `cromwellUrl` parameter in `application.conf`. You can get a build of your current Cromwell code with [these instructions](Building.md).; The server can be run with `java -jar <Cromwell JAR> server`, checkout [this page](../CommandLine.md) ; for more detailed instructions. ; You can now run the tests from another terminal. ## Running. There are two ways to invoke the integration tests:. * `sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / test""` - compiles Centaur and runs all tests via sbt directly. Tests are expected to be in the `centaur/src/main/standardTestCases` directory. This can be changed by modifying `reference.conf`. * `src/ci/bin/testCentaurLocal.sh` - runs the same tests using the continuous integration pipeline configuration. * Tests that require different Cromwell and Centaur configurations can be invoked by calling the various scripts in `src/ci/bin`. ### Tags. All tests are tagged with their name and their TESTFORMAT, and also any custom tags specified in the `.test` file. Tag names are all lower case, so a test named ""tagFoo"" has a tag ""tagfoo"". To run only those tests which have been tagged with a specified tag `tagFoo`:; ```; sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / testOnly * -- -n tagfoo""; ```. Or to instead exclude all tests which have been tagged with a specified tag `tagFoo`:; ```; sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / testOnly * -- -l tagfoo""; ```. ## Adding custom tests.

This ; strategy works well for workflows that generate multi-gigabyte files and where hashing these files on the ; cromwell instance provides CPU or I/O problems. ; NOTE: This strategy requires hard-linking as a dupliation strategy, as copying changes the last modified time. (*) The `fingerprint` and `xxh64` strategies are features that are community supported by Cromwell's HPC community. There; is no official support from the core Cromwell team. (**) This value is configurable.; ; ### Workflow log directory. To change the directory where Cromwell writes workflow logs, change the directory location via the setting:. ```hocon; workflow-options {; workflow-log-dir = ""cromwell-workflow-logs""; }; ```. **Preserving Workflow Logs**. By default Cromwell erases the per workflow logs when the workflow completes to reduce disk usage. You can change this behavior by setting the following value to `false`:. ```hocon; workflow-options {; workflow-log-temporary = true; }; ```. **Exception monitoring via Sentry**. Cromwell supports [Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io) which is a service that can be used to monitor exceptions reported in an application’s logs. To enable Sentry monitoring in Cromwell, enter your DSN URL using the system property:. ```properties; sentry.dsn=DSN_URL; ```. ### Job shell configuration. Cromwell allows for system-wide or per-backend job shell configuration for running user commands rather than always; using the default `/bin/bash`.

See `Backend` in [ReadTheDocs](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more information. ### Workflow Completion Callback; Cromwell can be configured to send a POST request to a specified URL when a workflow completes. The request body includes the workflow ID, terminal state,; and (if applicable) final outputs or error message. See `WorkflowCallback` in [ReadTheDocs](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more information. ### Other Improvements; * Cromwell will now parallelize the downloads of DRS files that resolve to signed URLs. This significantly reduces the time localization takes in certain situations.; * WDL size engine function now works for HTTP files; * Improved Cromwell's handling of docker manifests. Additional logging information is emitted, and Cromwell will fall back to using OCI manifests if it encounters an error with a Docker Image Manifest V2. . ## 85 Release Notes. ### Migration of PKs to BIGINT. The PK of below tables will be migrated from INT to BIGINT. Also, since `ROOT_WORKFLOW_ID` in `SUB_WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY` is a FK to `WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY_ID` in `WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY`; it is also being migrated from INT to BIGINT.; * DOCKER_HASH_STORE_ENTRY; * WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY; * SUB_WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY. ### Improvement to ""retry with more memory"" behavior.

Importantly,; AWS Batch calls ECS' `RunTask` API when submitting the job. It uses the; task definition, and overrides both the command text and the environment; variables. Input files are read into the container from S3 and output files are copied back to; S3. Three additional files are also written to the S3 bucket using the names of these; environment variables:. * AWS_CROMWELL_RC_FILE (the return code of the task); * AWS_CROMWELL_STDOUT_FILE (STDOUT of the task); * AWS_CROMWELL_STDERR_FILE (STDERR of the task). These files are placed in the correct location in S3 after task execution. In addition; STDOUT and STDERR are fed to the tasks cloudwatch log.

In testing, specifically with large fan-in operations such as the MergeVCFs; task of the Haplotype caller test, that the container overrides length limit; of 8k was being exceeded.

Testability,"e info; [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/Google/). ## 67 Release Notes. ### Configuration updates for improved scaling. Some configuration changes were introduced in Cromwell 67 to support improved scaling. See Cromwell's `reference.conf` for details on new parameters. * I/O throttling moved from `io` to its own `io.throttle` stanza; config updates may be required if these values are currently being overridden in local deployments. * The default `system.job-rate-control` has been changed from 50 per second to 20 per 10 seconds. * New configuration parameters have been introduced for values which were previously hardcoded constants:; * `system.file-hash-batch-size`, value updated from `100` to `50`.; * `io.gcs.max-batch-size`, value stays the same at `100`.; * `io.gcs.max-batch-duration`, value stays the same at `5 seconds`. * New configuration parameters which should not require updating:; * `io.command-backpressure-staleness`; * `io.backpressure-extension-log-threshold`; * `load-control.io-normal-window-minimum`; * `load-control.io-normal-window-maximum`. * `io.nio.parallelism` was previously misspelled in `reference.conf` but not in Cromwell's configuration reading code. Only correct spellings of this configuration key had or will have effect. ## 66 Release Notes. ### Google Artifact Registry Support; Cromwell now supports call caching when using Docker images hosted on; [Google Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry). ### Google Image Repository Hashing Updates; The previously documented `docker.hash-lookup.gcr` configuration has been renamed to `docker.hash-lookup.google` and; now applies to both Google Container Registry (GCR) and Google Artifact Registry (GAR) repositories.; Support for the `docker.hash-lookup.gcr-api-queries-per-100-seconds` configuration key has been formally discontinued; and a bug preventing correct handling of `docker.hash-lookup...throttle` configuration has been fixed.; Please see Cromwell'",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:23256,log,log-threshold,23256,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['log'],['log-threshold']

If you don't update the `actor-factory` value, you'll get a deprecation warning in the logs, and Cromwell will default back to **PAPI V1**. ### Task Retries; Cromwell now supports retrying failed tasks up to a specified count by declaring a value for the [maxRetries](RuntimeAttributes.md#maxRetries) key through the WDL runtime attributes. ### Labels; * Cromwell has removed most of the formatting restrictions from custom labels. Please check the [README](README.md#label-format) for more detailed documentation.; * Custom labels won't be submitted to Google backend as they are now decoupled from Google's default labels.; * Cromwell now publishes the labels as soon as the workflow is submitted (whether started or on hold).

Remember; that one day you might need to support this code!. ### Reviewing the Concept. Ask the questions:; ; - Will Cromwell be a better product with this change adopted. ; - Will it be better enough to warrant the time necessary to review the PR; - Note: The answer to this is almost always a yes if the first answer was yes; - However, overly long, opaque, or ""risky"" changes might benefit from requests to break the PR up and merge/review things in stages. ; ; ### Review the changes in the PR. - For PRs changing ""supported"" features, treat it like any other PR coming from within the team.; - Remember: we will have to support these changes in the future. Possibly forever!; - For PRs only making changes to features we don't officially support - be generous. But make sure:; - That any new optional functionality is opt-in rather than becoming the default.; - That any community features are flagged in documentation and config examples as originating from the community (and thus may not be supported by the team if bugs are found).; ; ### Run CI against the PR. - Opening a PR triggers CI to run automatically. However, if the PR was not opened by a trusted contributor, it will wait in a Github Actions queue until a trusted contributor explicitly allows CI tests run. ### Cycle through Review and CI. - If the community contributor makes changes following your reviews or the CI results:; - Glance at the changes to make sure they still seem reasonable.; - Make any additional comments; - Rerun CI.; ; ### Merge the PR. - Once the tests have completed successfully and the PR has two approvals, it can be merged.; - Remember to delete your branch clone PR (and the cloned branch itself too!).

The `testFormat` field can be one of the following, case insensitive:; * `workflowsuccess`: The workflow being supplied is expected to successfully complete; * `workflowfailure`: The workflow being supplied is expected to fail. The `metadata` is optional. If supplied, Centaur will retrieve the metadata from the successfully completed workflow and compare the values retrieved to those supplied. At the moment the only fields supported are strings, numbers and booleans. You can find which metadata is recorded by running a workflow ```java -jar <Cromwell JAR> run -m metadata.json my_workflow.wdl```.; This will save the metadata in `metadata.json`. For any metadata values or outputExpectations which require workflow ID (i.e, file paths), use `<<UUID>>` as a placeholder instead. For example:; * `""calls.hello.hello.stdout"": ""gs://google-project/jes/root/wdl/<<UUID>>/call-task/task-stdout.log""`.

Previous versions of Cromwell incorporated the name of the backend on which a call was run into the call cache hashes generated for that call.; Unfortunately this made it impossible to change the name of a backend without losing all previously run calls as potential cache hits.; Cromwell 37 introduces the `name-for-call-caching-purposes` backend configuration option as a means of decoupling the backend name from the; value used for the backend name for call caching purposes. ### CWL. Support `InputResourceRequirement` hint. ### Changing configuration options. #### Logging Token Distribution. In cases where its not obvious why jobs are queued in Cromwell, you can enable logging for the Job Execution Token Dispenser, using; the `system.hog-safety.token-log-interval-seconds` configuration value. The default, `0`, means that no logging will occur. #### HTTP Filesystem. - The HTTP filesystem is now enabled for engine use by default. To continue without an HTTP filesystem, you can add the; following content into the appropriate stanza of your configuration file:; ```; engine {; filesystems {; http {; enabled: false; }; }; }; ```; - When the value `exit-code-timeout-seconds` is set, `check-alive` command is now only called once every timeout interval instead of each poll. ### Beta preview of new Womtool `/describe` endpoint.

Cromwell outputs log in one of two formats, either `pretty` or `standard`. You can change the format of the logs by setting the property to `LOG_MODE`. * In `standard` mode, your logs will be written without ANSI escape code coloring, with a layout more appropriate for server logs. * In `pretty` mode, your logs are output in a colorful, easier to read format, more appropriate for a single workflow run. The default mode for server is `standard`, while the default when running a single worklow is `pretty`. You can explicitly specify the format by running cromwell with:. ```bash; java -DLOG_MODE=pretty -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. ### Log Level. By default, Cromwell outputs messages at a `LOG_LEVEL` of `INFO`. Sometimes, you may want more or less information logged. For example, while debugging an issue you may want to increase the amount information in the logs temporarily. Alternatively, the standard level may be too verbose, and you may only want Cromwell to log warnings and errors. You can set the level via the property `LOG_LEVEL` to any one of the values: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, or `OFF`. The default log level is `INFO`. ```bash; java -DLOG_LEVEL=DEBUG -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. ## Workflow Logs. While a workflow is running, Cromwell generates a log file specifically for the workflow. After the workflow completes, to clear up local disk space, Cromwell deletes the local copy of this log file. See the [Configuration](Configuring#workflow-log-directory) section on logs for more information on preventing cromwell from deleting each workflow log. Before Cromwell deletes the files and before the workflow completes, you can configure Cromwell to copy the workflow; logs to various locations.

It's possible that 200 is too high in some environments, but 200 is more likely to be an appropriate value; than the previous default. ## 27. ### Migration. * Call Caching has been improved in this version of Cromwell, specifically the time needed to determine whether or not a job can be cached; has drastically decreased. To achieve that the database schema has been modified and a migration is required in order to preserve the pre-existing cached jobs.; This migration is relatively fast compared to previous migrations. To get an idea of the time needed, look at the size of your `CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY` table.; As a benchmark, it takes 1 minute for a table with 6 million rows.; The migration will only be executed on MySQL. Other databases will lose their previous cached jobs.; In order to run properly on MySQL, **the following flag needs to be adjusted**: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_group_concat_max_len; The following query will give you a minimum to set the group_concat_max_len value to:. ```sql; SELECT MAX(aggregated) as group_concat_max_len FROM; (; SELECT cche.CALL_CACHING_ENTRY_ID, SUM(LENGTH(CONCAT(cche.HASH_KEY, cche.HASH_VALUE))) AS aggregated; FROM CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY cche; GROUP BY cche.CALL_CACHING_ENTRY_ID; ) aggregation; ```. Here is the SQL command to run to set the group_concat_max_len flag to the proper value:. ```sql; SET GLOBAL group_concat_max_len = value; ```. Where `value` is replaced with the value you want to set it to. Note that the migration will fail if the flag is not set properly. ### Breaking Changes. * The update to Slick 3.2 requires a databa",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:88945,benchmark,benchmark,88945,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['benchmark'],['benchmark']

You can get a build of your current Cromwell code with [these instructions](Building.md).; The server can be run with `java -jar <Cromwell JAR> server`, checkout [this page](../CommandLine.md) ; for more detailed instructions. ; You can now run the tests from another terminal. ## Running. There are two ways to invoke the integration tests:. * `sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / test""` - compiles Centaur and runs all tests via sbt directly. Tests are expected to be in the `centaur/src/main/standardTestCases` directory. This can be changed by modifying `reference.conf`. * `src/ci/bin/testCentaurLocal.sh` - runs the same tests using the continuous integration pipeline configuration. * Tests that require different Cromwell and Centaur configurations can be invoked by calling the various scripts in `src/ci/bin`. ### Tags. All tests are tagged with their name and their TESTFORMAT, and also any custom tags specified in the `.test` file. Tag names are all lower case, so a test named ""tagFoo"" has a tag ""tagfoo"". To run only those tests which have been tagged with a specified tag `tagFoo`:; ```; sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / testOnly * -- -n tagfoo""; ```. Or to instead exclude all tests which have been tagged with a specified tag `tagFoo`:; ```; sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / testOnly * -- -l tagfoo""; ```. ## Adding custom tests. You can add your own tests to the test suite by adding `-Dcentaur.optionalTestPath=DIR` on your sbt invocation, ; e.g. `sbt -Dcentaur.optionalTestPath=/some/path/to/tests test`. The value of `DIR` is expected to be a directory; which contains one or more test case files.; ; The same result can be achieved more permanently by adding the custom directory into the `application.conf` file directly: ; ```; centaur {; optionalTestPath = ""/some/path/to/tests""; }; ```. ## Defining test cases.

Testability,"gle workflow run. The default mode for server is `standard`, while the default when running a single worklow is `pretty`. You can explicitly specify the format by running cromwell with:. ```bash; java -DLOG_MODE=pretty -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. ### Log Level. By default, Cromwell outputs messages at a `LOG_LEVEL` of `INFO`. Sometimes, you may want more or less information logged. For example, while debugging an issue you may want to increase the amount information in the logs temporarily. Alternatively, the standard level may be too verbose, and you may only want Cromwell to log warnings and errors. You can set the level via the property `LOG_LEVEL` to any one of the values: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, or `OFF`. The default log level is `INFO`. ```bash; java -DLOG_LEVEL=DEBUG -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. ## Workflow Logs. While a workflow is running, Cromwell generates a log file specifically for the workflow. After the workflow completes, to clear up local disk space, Cromwell deletes the local copy of this log file. See the [Configuration](Configuring#workflow-log-directory) section on logs for more information on preventing cromwell from deleting each workflow log. Before Cromwell deletes the files and before the workflow completes, you can configure Cromwell to copy the workflow; logs to various locations. Normally, you'll want to copy the log to a remote bucket or directory. To specify the remote; directory to copy the logs to, use the separate [Workflow Option](wf_options/Overview#output-copying); `final_workflow_log_dir`. ## Call Logs. As each call in a workflow runs, it generates output to the standard output and standard error. This output is stored per call in call log files. Additionally, depending on the backend, specific per call backand logs may be generated. All of these call logs may be copied at the end of a workflow to a remote directory. Configure this directory by setting the [Workflow Option](wf_options/Overview#output-copy",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Logging.md:1997,log,log,1997,docs/Logging.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Logging.md,1,['log'],['log']

Then run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f jes-cromwell/docker-compose.yml up` to start a Cromwell server with a Google Cloud backend on MySQL. **MySQL**. The data directory in the MySQL container is [mounted to `compose/mysql/data`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/develop/scripts/docker-compose-mysql/compose/mysql/init), which allows the data to survive a `docker-compose down`. To disable this feature, simply remove the `./compose/mysql/data:/var/lib/mysql` line in the [volume section of `docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/scripts/docker-compose-mysql/docker-compose.yml). Note that in such case, the data will still be preserved by a `docker-compose stop` that stops the container but doesn't delete it. **Notes**. To run Cromwell in the background, add `-d` at the end of the command:; `docker-compose up -d`. To then see the logs for a specific service, run `docker-compose logs -f <service>`. ; For example `docker-compose logs -f cromwell`. For more information about docker compose: [Docker compose doc](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). **Insert Batch Size**. Cromwell queues up and then inserts batches of records into the database for increased performance. You can adjust the; number of database rows batch inserted by Cromwell as follows:. ```hocon; database {; insert-batch-size = 2000; }; ```. **Separate Metadata Database**. This feature should be considered _experimental_ and likely to change in the future. Cromwell stores metadata about each job and workflow intended. This metadata is intended for end users, and includes paths to job results, start and end times, etc. The metadata grows at a significantly faster rate than the rest of the internal engine data. To use a separate database for metadata, under the `database` config section, configure a sub-path for `metadata` with custom settings. ```hocon; database {; # Store metad",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md:9242,log,logs,9242,docs/Configuring.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md,2,['log'],['logs']

To change the directory where Cromwell writes workflow logs, change the directory location via the setting:. ```hocon; workflow-options {; workflow-log-dir = ""cromwell-workflow-logs""; }; ```. **Preserving Workflow Logs**. By default Cromwell erases the per workflow logs when the workflow completes to reduce disk usage. You can change this behavior by setting the following value to `false`:. ```hocon; workflow-options {; workflow-log-temporary = true; }; ```. **Exception monitoring via Sentry**. Cromwell supports [Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io) which is a service that can be used to monitor exceptions reported in an application’s logs. To enable Sentry monitoring in Cromwell, enter your DSN URL using the system property:. ```properties; sentry.dsn=DSN_URL; ```. ### Job shell configuration. Cromwell allows for system-wide or per-backend job shell configuration for running user commands rather than always; using the default `/bin/bash`. To set the job shell on a system-wide basis use the configuration key `system.job-shell` or on a; per-backend basis with `<config-key-for-backend>.job-shell`. For example:. ```; # system-wide setting, all backends get this; -Dsystem.job-shell=/bin/sh; ```. ```; # override for just the Local backend; -Dbackend.providers.Local.config.job-shell=/bin/sh; ```. For the Config backend the value of the job shell will be available in the `${job_shell}` variable. See Cromwell's `reference.conf` for an example; of how this is used for the default configuration of the `Local` backend.

This backend makes the same assumption about the filesystem that the local backend does: the Cromwell process and the jobs both have read/write access to the CWD of the job. The CWD will contain a `script.sh` file which will contain the same contents as the Local backend:. ```; #!/bin/sh; cd <container_call_root>; <user_command>; echo $? > rc; ```. The job is launched with a configurable script command such as:. ```; chmod 755 ${script}; cat > ${cwd}/execution/submitFile <<EOF; Iwd=${cwd}/execution; requirements=${nativeSpecs}; leave_in_queue=true; request_memory=${memory_mb}; request_disk=${disk_kb}; error=${err}; output=${out}; log_xml=true; request_cpus=${cpu}; executable=${script}; log=${cwd}/execution/execution.log; queue; EOF; condor_submit ${cwd}/execution/submitFile; ```. The HtCondor backend gets the job ID from parsing the `submit.stdout` text file. Since the `script.sh` ends with `echo $? > rc`, the backend will wait for the existence of this file, parse out the return code and determine success or failure and then subsequently post-process. The command used to submit the job is specified under the configuration key `backend.providers.HtCondor.config.submit`.

As a further optimization the PAPI backend has the concept of ""this"" bucket on a per-workflow basis, where ""this"" bucket is; the bucket that contains the current workflow root.; If `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` is specified in ; workflow options on the PAPI backend, Cromwell will automatically prepend ""this"" bucket to the call cache hit path prefixes to search.; For example, if Charles specified the same workflow options as in the example above and his workflow root was under `gs://charles_bucket`,; Cromwell would search cache hits in all of the `gs://alice_bucket`, `gs://bob_bucket` and `gs://charles_bucket` buckets without having to specify; `gs://charles_bucket` bucket explicitly in `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes`. If no `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` are specified then all matching cache hits will be considered. ***Call cache failure logging***. When Cromwell fails to cache a job from a previous result the reason will be logged. To reduce the verbosity of the logs; only the first three failure reasons will be logged per shard of each job. Cromwell will continue to try copying; previous results for the call, and when no candidates are left Cromwell will run the job on the backend. **Docker Tags**. Certain Docker tags can impact call caching performance. ; Docker tags are a convenient way to point to a version of an image (`ubuntu:14.04`), or even the latest version (`ubuntu:latest`).; For that purpose, tags are mutable, meaning that the image they point to can change, while the tag name stays the same.; While this is very convenient in some cases, using mutable, or ""floating"" tags in tasks affects the reproducibility of a workflow. ; If you were to run the same workflow using `ubuntu:latest` now, and again in a year (or even in a month) may run with different docker images.; This has an even bigger impact when",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md:7842,log,logging,7842,docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,1,['log'],['logging']

As mentioned, `reference` will not copy the file and simply point the results to the existing location.; See the [Call Caching documentation](../cromwell_features/CallCaching.md) for more information. ## Requester Pays. GCS has a feature called Requester Pays (RP). This section describes how Cromwell supports it and the consequences on cost. Please first read the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/requester-pays) if you're not already familiar with it. The billing project Cromwell uses to access a bucket with requester pays is determined as follows:. - If a `google_project` was set in the [workflow options](../wf_options/Google.md) when the workflow was submitted, this value is used; - Otherwise, the value of the `project` field in the `gcs` filesystem configuration is used; - Otherwise, if the machine Cromwell runs on is authenticated using gcloud and a default project is set, this value will be used. **Important Note #1**: In order for a project to be billable to access a bucket with requester pays, the credentials used need to have the `serviceusage.services.use` permission on this project. . **Important Note #2**: Pipelines API version 1 does **not** support buckets with requester pays, so while Cromwell itself might be able to access bucket with RP, jobs running on Pipelines API V1 with file inputs and / or outputs will **not** work.; For full requester pays support, use the [Pipelines API v2 Cromwell backend](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#pipelines-api-v2). . **Important Note #3**: Access to requester pays buckets from Cromwell is seamless, this also means that Cromwell will not report in the logs or metadata when it access a bucket with requester pays. It is the user's responsibility to be aware of the extra cost of running workflows access requester pays buckets.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/GoogleCloudStorage.md:3094,log,logs,3094,docs/filesystems/GoogleCloudStorage.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/GoogleCloudStorage.md,1,['log'],['logs']

Install the <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads"" target=""_blank"">Google Cloud SDK</a>.; Create a <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects"" target=""_blank"">Google Cloud Project</a> and give it a project id (e.g. sample-project). We’ll refer to this as `<google-project-id>` and your user login (e.g. username@gmail.com) as `<google-user-id>`. On your Google project, open up the <a href=""https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library"" target=""_blank"">API Manager</a> and enable the following APIs:. * Google Compute Engine API; * Cloud Storage; * Google Cloud Batch API. Authenticate to Google Cloud Platform ; `gcloud auth login <google-user-id>`. Set your default account (will require to login again) ; `gcloud auth application-default login`. Set your default project ; `gcloud config set project <google-project-id>`.

Administrators can now configure Cromwell with an allow list that limits the domains from which WDLs can be resolved and imported.; Default behavior is unchanged (Cromwell attempts to resolve WDL files from any URI). Example configuration:; ```; languages {; WDL {; http-allow-list {; enabled: true; allowed-http-hosts: [; ""my.wdl.repo.org"",; ""raw.githubusercontent.com""; ]; }; }; }; ```. ### CWL implementation removed. This release removes the `cwl` top-level artifact. Some nonfunctional references may remain, and will be addressed over time. For more information, see the [Cromwell 79 release notes](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases/tag/79). ### TES Improvments. * Tes system errors are are now reported in Cromwell execution logs when the TES backend returns a task error. * Cromwell now attempts to translate `disks` attributes [written for GCP](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/RuntimeAttributes/#disks) into valid `disk` attributes for TES. For information on supported conversions, refer to the [TES documentation](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/TES/). ### Bug Fixes. * Reference disks are only mounted if configured in the workflow options. * Recent docker images of Ubuntu use a new manifest format, ensure that these newer image versions can be pulled from Docker Registry without issue. * When converting ValueStore objects to strings for logging, we truncate long values to limit memory usage. ### Security Patching.

Spark backend was not widely used and it was decided to remove it from the codebase in order to narrow the scope of Cromwell code. ### Improved DRS Localizer logging. Error logging while localizing a DRS URI should now be more clear especially when there is a Requester Pays bucket involved. ### Per-backend hog factors; Cromwell now allows overriding system-level log factors on back-end level. First, Cromwell will try to use hog-factor; defined in the backend config, and if it is not defined, it will default to using system-wide hog factor.; ```conf; backend {; providers {; PAPIv2 {; config {; hog-factor: 2; }; }; }; }; ```; For more information about hog factors please see [this page](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/cromwell_features/HogFactors/). ### `martha_v2` Support Removed.

If the extension is present, setting up the database; requires just these commands:. ```; $ createdb cromwell; $ psql -d cromwell -c ""create extension lo;""; ```. Postgresql configuration in Cromwell is very similar to MySQL. An example:. ```hocon; database {; profile = ""slick.jdbc.PostgresProfile$""; db {; driver = ""org.postgresql.Driver""; url = ""jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/cromwell""; user = ""user""; password = ""pass""; port = 5432; connectionTimeout = 5000; }; }; ```. If you want multiple database users to be able to read Cromwell's data from a Postgresql database, you'll need to create a; role that all relevant users have access to, and adjust Cromwell to use this role. This is because each Large Object is owned; by, and only readable by, the role that wrote it. First, pass these options when executing Cromwell. They will ensure that Cromwell's database tables are ; owned by the role, not the initial login user.; * `-DengineSharedCromwellDbRole=your_role` to control the role that owns the engine tables; * `-DsharedCromwellDbRole=your_role` to control the role that owns the metadata tables. Next, use the config key `pgLargeObjectWriteRole` to set the role that should own all large objects, as shown below. ; This config will have no effect if you aren't using Postgresql. The configured login user can be any user that is; granted the shared role. ```hocon; database {; profile = ""slick.jdbc.PostgresProfile$""; pgLargeObjectWriteRole = ""your_role""; db {; driver = ""org.postgresql.Driver""; url = ""jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/cromwell""; user = ""user""; password = ""pass""; port = 5432; connectionTimeout = 5000; }; }; ```. **Using Cromwell with file-based database (No server required)**.

Testability,"m, you will have to install Singularity, which is documented [here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/admin-guide/admin_quickstart.html#installation).; In order to gain access to the full set of features in Singularity, it is strongly recommended that Singularity is installed by root, with the `setuid` bit enabled, as is ([documented here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/2.6/admin-guide/security.html#how-does-singularity-do-it)).; This likely means that you will have to ask your sysadmin to install it for you.; Because `singularity` ideally needs `setuid`, your admins may have some qualms about giving Singularity this privilege.; If that is the case, you might consider forwarding [this letter](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html#singularity-on-a-shared-resource) to your admins. If you are not able to get Singularity installed with these privileges, you can attempt a user install.; If this is the case, you will have to alter your Cromwell configuration to work in ""sandbox"" mode, which is explained in [this part](#without-setuid) of the documentation. . #### Configuring Cromwell for Singularity. Once Singularity is installed, you'll need to modify the `config` block inside `backend.providers` in your Cromwell configuration. In particular, this block contains a key called `submit-docker`, which will contain a script that is run whenever a job needs to run that uses a Docker image. If the job does not specify a Docker image, the regular `submit` block will be used. As the configuration will require more knowledge about your execution environment, see the local and job scheduler sections below for example configurations. ##### Local environments. On local backends, you have to configure Cromwell to use a different ; `submit-docker` script that would start Singularity instead of docker. ; Singularity requires docker images to be prefixed with the prefix `docker://`. Using containers isolates the filesystem that the script is allowed to interact with, ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md:5424,sandbox,sandbox,5424,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md,2,['sandbox'],['sandbox']
Testability,"mages.; This has an even bigger impact when Call Caching is turned on in Cromwell, and could lead to unpredictable behaviors if a tag is updated in the middle of a workflow or even a scatter for example. In order to ensure perfect reproducibility, Docker provides another way of identifying an image version by using the specific digest of the image, which is an immutable identifier. The digest is guaranteed to be different if 2 images have different byte content. For more information see [Docker's api specs](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#/content-digests).; A docker image can be referenced using the digest (e.g. `ubuntu@sha256:71cd81252a3563a03ad8daee81047b62ab5d892ebbfbf71cf53415f29c130950`).; This image refers to a specific image of ubuntu that does not depend on a floating tag.; A workflow containing this Docker image run now and a year from now will run in the exact same container. However, in order to remove unpredictable behaviors, when Cromwell finds a job ready to be run, it will first look at its docker runtime attribute, and apply the following logic:. * If the job doesn't specify a docker image it will be dispatched and all call caching settings (read/write) will apply normally.; * If the job does specify a docker runtime attribute, then:; * if the docker image uses a hash, all call caching settings apply normally; * if the docker image uses a floating tag:; * Cromwell will attempt to look up the immutable digest of the image with this floating tag. Upon success it will pass both the floating tag and this digest value to the backend.; * All backends currently included with Cromwell will utilize this digest value to run the job.; * Within a single workflow, all floating tags within a given workflow will resolve to the same digest value even if Cromwell is restarted when the workflow is running.; * If Cromwell fails to lookup the digest (for instance an unsupported docker registry, wrong credentials, ...) it will run the job with the user provid",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md:9876,log,logic,9876,docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,1,['log'],['logic']
Testability,"ment.scala):. * The conversion from AST to WDLOM relies on two other conversions, `astNodeToTypeElement` and `astNodeToExpressionElement`, ; to validate the attributes on the AST it is given, and construct WDLOM from Hermes ASTs.; * The resulting function can itself be used as a building block to construct higher-level WDLOM types. . #### How AST-to-WDLOM building blocks are chained together. To see how these building blocks are pieced together we can look at WDL 1.0's [`ast2wdlom`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/master/wdl/transforms/draft3/src/main/scala/wdl/draft3/transforms/ast2wdlom/ast2wdlom.scala) package object. Notice how - and where - the `astToInputDeclarationElement` value is declared:. * It follows the `implicit val`s `astNodeToTypeElement` and `astNodeToExpressionElement` and so can use those in its processing.; * It is, as an `implicit val`, used later on by `astNodeToInputsSectionElement`, which is then used by `astNodeToWorkflowBodyElement` and `astNodeToTaskSectionElement`, and so on. . #### How different WDL versions convert to WDLOM differently. These package objects ultimately control how different WDL versions are parsed differently. These differences can be seen most easily by comparing package objects for different WDL versions:. ```bash; diff \; wdl/transforms/draft3/src/main/scala/wdl/draft3/transforms/ast2wdlom/ast2wdlom.scala \; wdl/transforms/biscayne/src/main/scala/wdl/transforms/biscayne/ast2wdlom/ast2wdlom.scala ; ``` . In an extreme case, these could contain fundamentally different conversion logic from AST to WDLOM for different WDL versions. Luckily, between; WDL 1.0 and the WDL `development` version, there are only a few minor changes, amongst which are:. * Importing a new Hermes parser.; * Specifying that additional functions are available when constructing the `astNodeToExpressionElement` conversion.; * Specifying that a new `Directory` type is available when constructing the `astNodeToTypeElement` conversion.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/bitesize/workflowParsing/wdlToWdlom.md:3478,log,logic,3478,docs/developers/bitesize/workflowParsing/wdlToWdlom.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/bitesize/workflowParsing/wdlToWdlom.md,2,['log'],['logic']

For more information, see the [Cromwell 79 release notes](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/releases/tag/79). ### TES Improvments. * Tes system errors are are now reported in Cromwell execution logs when the TES backend returns a task error. * Cromwell now attempts to translate `disks` attributes [written for GCP](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/RuntimeAttributes/#disks) into valid `disk` attributes for TES. For information on supported conversions, refer to the [TES documentation](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/TES/). ### Bug Fixes. * Reference disks are only mounted if configured in the workflow options. * Recent docker images of Ubuntu use a new manifest format, ensure that these newer image versions can be pulled from Docker Registry without issue. * When converting ValueStore objects to strings for logging, we truncate long values to limit memory usage. ### Security Patching. Updates to dependencies to fix security vulnerabilities. ## 84 Release Notes. ### CromIAM enabled user checks. For Cromwell instances utilizing the optional CromIAM identity and access management component, the following endpoints now verify that the calling user is enabled before forwarding the request.; * `/api/workflows/v1/backends`; * `/api/womtool/v1/describe`. This change makes the above endpoints consistent with the existing behavior of all the other endpoints in the `/api/` path of CromIAM. ## 83 Release Notes. * Changes the type of several primary key columns in call caching tables from int to bigint. The database migration may be lengthy if your database contains a large amount of call caching data. ## 82 Release Notes. * Restored missing example configuration file; * Upgraded to latest version of the Google Cloud Storage NIO library (0.124.8); * Cromwell will now finitely retry the following Google",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:13609,log,logging,13609,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['log'],['logging']

In the; Cromwell GCP Batch backend, the usage of this feature is very similar to the regular; base64-encoded `username:password` token, except that it is the GSM paths of username and password that are separated by; a colon and base64; encoded:. ```; backend {; default = GCPBATCH; providers {; GCPBATCH {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.google.batch.GcpBatchBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; dockerhub {; token = ""base64-encoded-GSM-path-to-docker-hub-username:GSM-path-to-docker-hub-password""; }; }; }; }; }; ```. Note that as per the Google Secret Manager docs, the compute service account for the project in which the GCP Batch; jobs will run will need to be assigned the `Secret Manager Secret Accessor` IAM role. **Monitoring**. In order to monitor metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk usage...) about the VM during Call Runtime, a workflow option can be used to specify the path to a script that will run in the background and write its output to a log file. ```; {; ""monitoring_script"": ""gs://cromwell/monitoring/script.sh""; }; ```. The output of this script will be written to a `monitoring.log` file that will be available in the call gcs bucket when the call completes. This feature is meant to run a script in the background during long-running processes. It's possible that if the task is very short that the log file does not flush before de-localization happens and you will end up with a zero byte file. **Google Cloud Storage Filesystem**. On the Google Batch backend the GCS (Google Cloud Storage) filesystem is used for the root of the workflow execution.; On the Local, SGE, and associated backends any GCS URI will be downloaded locally.

This bit is easy, you're just going to copy and paste something from the internet. Open your favorite editor. Paste in the following content and save it as `myWorkflow.wdl` in your new `cromwell` directory:. ```wdl; # Example workflow; # Declare WDL version 1.0 if working in Terra; version 1.0; workflow myWorkflow {; 	call myTask; }. task myTask {; 	command <<<; 		echo ""hello world""; 	>>>; 	output {; 		String out = read_string(stdout()); 	}; }; ```. Don't worry, **you don't need to understand too much about the workflow contents to continue for now**. In brief, it tells Cromwell to run a task to run `echo ""hello world""`, and then return the output as a String. If you'd like to learn more about how to author WDL, you can find all the WDL resources you could ever want [here](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl). ### Step 3: Running the workflow. Ok, we have Cromwell, we have a workflow, let's put it all together! . Make sure you're in the cromwell directory with the `.jar` file and the `.wdl` file. Now type in:; ```sh; java -jar cromwell-XY.jar run myWorkflow.wdl; ```. Cromwell will print out a fair old chunk of logging information, which can be configured (once you've completed this tutorial and [Configuration Files](ConfigurationFiles), you might want to investigate the [Logging](../Logging) page). Ultimately, the workflow should succeed and you'll end up with the following output printed out when Cromwell finishes:; ```json; {; 	""myWorkflow.myTask.out"": ""hello world""; }; ```. Ok, you can stop your timer! You just installed and ran your first workflow in Cromwell, congratulations!. ### Next Steps. Pat yourself on the back for completing this tutorial, bravo!

You can get a build of your current Cromwell code with [these instructions](Building.md).; The server can be run with `java -jar <Cromwell JAR> server`, checkout [this page](../CommandLine.md) ; for more detailed instructions. ; You can now run the tests from another terminal. ## Running. There are two ways to invoke the integration tests:. * `sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / test""` - compiles Centaur and runs all tests via sbt directly. Tests are expected to be in the `centaur/src/main/standardTestCases` directory. This can be changed by modifying `reference.conf`. * `src/ci/bin/testCentaurLocal.sh` - runs the same tests using the continuous integration pipeline configuration. * Tests that require different Cromwell and Centaur configurations can be invoked by calling the various scripts in `src/ci/bin`. ### Tags. All tests are tagged with their name and their TESTFORMAT, and also any custom tags specified in the `.test` file. Tag names are all lower case, so a test named ""tagFoo"" has a tag ""tagfoo"". To run only those tests which have been tagged with a specified tag `tagFoo`:; ```; sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / testOnly * -- -n tagfoo""; ```. Or to instead exclude all tests which have been tagged with a specified tag `tagFoo`:; ```; sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / testOnly * -- -l tagfoo""; ```. ## Adding custom tests. You can add your own tests to the test suite by adding `-Dcentaur.optionalTestPath=DIR` on your sbt invocation, ; e.g. `sbt -Dcentaur.optionalTestPath=/some/path/to/tests test`. The value of `DIR` is expected to be a directory; which contains one or more test case files.; ; The same result can be achieved more permanently by adding the custom directory into the `application.conf` file directly: ; ```; centaur {; optionalTestPath = ""/some/path/to/tests""; }; ```. ## Defining test cases.

For example, the statement `String s = ""\""""` is now supported, whereas previously it produced a syntax error. #### Empty call blocks in WDL 1.0. Cromwell's WDL 1.0 implementation now allows empty call blocks, e.g. `call task_with_no_inputs {}`. This brings 1.0 in line with draft-2, which has always supported this syntax. #### Packed CWL bugfix. Fixed a bug that caused an error like `Custom type was referred to but not found` to be issued when using an imported type as a `SchemaDefRequirement` in packed CWL. ## 39 Release Notes. ### Cromwell ID changes. When set, the configuration value of `system.cromwell_id` will now have a random suffix appended, unless the; configuration key `system.cromwell_id_random_suffix` is set to `false`. The generated id also appears more places in the logs, including when picking up workflows from the database and during; shutdown. ### Bug fixes. #### Format fix for `write_map()`. Fixed an issue that caused the `write_map()` function in Cromwell's WDL 1.0 implementation to produce output in the wrong format. Specifically, the output's rows and columns were swapped. WDL draft-2 was not affected. Incorrect `write_map()` output in Cromwell 38 and earlier:; ```; key1 key2 key3; value1 value2 value3; ```; Corrected `write_map()` output in Cromwell 39 and later:; ```; key1 value1; key2 value2; key3 value3; ```. ## 38 Release Notes. ### HPC paths with Docker. The `ConfigBackendLifecycleActorFactory` path variables `script`, `out` and `err` are now consistent when running with; and without docker. Similarly, when killing a docker task the `kill-docker` configuration key is now used instead of; `kill`.

Also note that for the `user_service_account_json` workflow option to work an auth of type `user_service_account`; must be defined in Cromwell's `google.auths` stanza; more details in the `User Service Account` section above. Example PAPI v2 workflow options for private Docker configuration:. ```; {; ""docker_credentials_key_name"": ""name/of/the/kms/key/used/for/encrypting/and/decrypting/the/docker/hub/token"",; ""docker_credentials_token"": ""base64_username:password"",; ""user_service_account_json"": ""<properly escaped user service account JSON file>""; }; ```. Important. If any of the three private Docker configuration values of key name, auth, or Docker token are missing, PAPI v2 will not perform a `docker login`.; If the Docker image to be pulled is not public the `docker pull` will fail which will cause the overall job to fail. If using any of these private Docker workflow options it is advisable to add; them to the `workflow-options.encrypted-fields` list in Cromwell configuration. **Monitoring**.

Coalesce metadata requests to eliminate expensive and redundant queries and metadata construction. #### Eliminate redundant SFS logging and metadata. Eliminate superfluous logging and metadata publishing in the shared filesystem backend on poll intervals where there was not a state change. #### AWS region configuration respected throughout.

Call cache failures are no longer sent to the workflow metadata. Instead a limited number of call cache failure messages; will be sent to the workflow log. See [the Cromwell call caching; documentation](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cromwell_features/CallCaching/) for more information on call; cache failure logging. ## 44 Release Notes. ### Improved PAPI v2 Preemptible VM Support. In some cases PAPI v2 will report the preemption of a VM in a way that differs from PAPI v1. This novel means of reporting; preemption was not recognized by Cromwell's PAPI v2 backend and would result in preemptions being miscategorized as call failures.; Cromwell's PAPI v2 backend will now handle this type of preemption. ## 43 Release Notes. ### Virtual Private Cloud with Subnetworks. Cromwell now allows PAPIV2 jobs to run on a specific subnetwork inside a private network by adding the subnetwork key; `subnetwork-label-key` inside `virtual-private-cloud` in backend configuration.

Testability,"on tests:. * `sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / test""` - compiles Centaur and runs all tests via sbt directly. Tests are expected to be in the `centaur/src/main/standardTestCases` directory. This can be changed by modifying `reference.conf`. * `src/ci/bin/testCentaurLocal.sh` - runs the same tests using the continuous integration pipeline configuration. * Tests that require different Cromwell and Centaur configurations can be invoked by calling the various scripts in `src/ci/bin`. ### Tags. All tests are tagged with their name and their TESTFORMAT, and also any custom tags specified in the `.test` file. Tag names are all lower case, so a test named ""tagFoo"" has a tag ""tagfoo"". To run only those tests which have been tagged with a specified tag `tagFoo`:; ```; sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / testOnly * -- -n tagfoo""; ```. Or to instead exclude all tests which have been tagged with a specified tag `tagFoo`:; ```; sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / testOnly * -- -l tagfoo""; ```. ## Adding custom tests. You can add your own tests to the test suite by adding `-Dcentaur.optionalTestPath=DIR` on your sbt invocation, ; e.g. `sbt -Dcentaur.optionalTestPath=/some/path/to/tests test`. The value of `DIR` is expected to be a directory; which contains one or more test case files.; ; The same result can be achieved more permanently by adding the custom directory into the `application.conf` file directly: ; ```; centaur {; optionalTestPath = ""/some/path/to/tests""; }; ```. ## Defining test cases. Each test case file is a HOCON file with the following structure:; ```; name: NAME // Required: Name of the test; testFormat: TESTFORMAT // Required: One of WorkflowSuccessTest, WorkflowFailureTest, runtwiceexpectingcallcaching; backends: [BACKENDNAME1, BACKENDNAME2, ...] // Optional list of backends.

The `basePath` field is optional, but if supplied all paths will be resolved from that directory. If it is not supplied, all paths will be resolved from the directory the test case file is in. The `testFormat` field can be one of the following, case insensitive:; * `workflowsuccess`: The workflow being supplied is expected to successfully complete; * `workflowfailure`: The workflow being supplied is expected to fail.

Testability,"one`|`NotStarted`|; |6|`Done`|`Running`|; |7|`Done`|`Done`|. In step 1, the workflow has just started and the ExecutionStore is created in its initial; state. The Value Store doesn't track statuses and so begins empty: `{ }`. In steps 2-4, the Execution Store tracks the `single_task` job as the engine is executing it. As the Execution Store is updated to indicate task completion is step 5, the Value Store is also updated to; include the output value of the task:; ```json; {; ""single_task.string_out"": ""hello""; }; ```. By step 6, Cromwell can use the fact that the task is complete to decide that the output node is ready to be; evaluated. And the input to the output expression is available for lookup in the Value Store. In step 7, all workflow nodes have run and the workflow is complete. The Value Store is updated once again to; additionally contain the output node value:; ```json; {; ""single_task.string_out"": ""hello"",; ""string_out"": ""hello""; }; ``` . Cromwell can use this information to trigger the ""workflow complete"" logic. ## Handling scatters. When Cromwell runs scattered tasks, the Execution Store cannot tell ahead of time how many; `JobKey`s it will need to represent all of the shards in the scatter. It can get around; this problem by putting a placeholder `JobKey` for the scatter node in the Execution Store. When; the scatter key is evaluated, it expands the Execution Store to include new `JobKey`s representing; every shard in the scatter. As with the single task example, the Value Store starts empty, and is updated with the results of each; shard only as and when they are generated. To see that in action, Consider this workflow:. ```wdl; version 1.0. workflow scattered_task_workflow {; scatter (x in range(2)) {; call scattered_task; }; output {; Int results_count = length(scattered_task.string_out); }; }. task scattered_task {; command {; echo hello; }; output {; String string_out = ""hello""; }; }; ```. #### Scatter Expansion.

All tests are tagged with their name and their TESTFORMAT, and also any custom tags specified in the `.test` file. Tag names are all lower case, so a test named ""tagFoo"" has a tag ""tagfoo"". To run only those tests which have been tagged with a specified tag `tagFoo`:; ```; sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / testOnly * -- -n tagfoo""; ```. Or to instead exclude all tests which have been tagged with a specified tag `tagFoo`:; ```; sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / testOnly * -- -l tagfoo""; ```. ## Adding custom tests. You can add your own tests to the test suite by adding `-Dcentaur.optionalTestPath=DIR` on your sbt invocation, ; e.g. `sbt -Dcentaur.optionalTestPath=/some/path/to/tests test`. The value of `DIR` is expected to be a directory; which contains one or more test case files.; ; The same result can be ac",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/Centaur.md:1107,test,tests,1107,docs/developers/Centaur.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/Centaur.md,1,['test'],['tests']

As a further optimization the PAPI backend has the concept of ""this"" bucket on a per-workflow basis, where ""this"" bucket is; the bucket that contains the current workflow root.; If `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` is specified in ; workflow options on the PAPI backend, Cromwell will automatically prepend ""this"" bucket to the call cache hit path prefixes to search.; For example, if Charles specified the same workflow options as in the example above and his workflow root was under `gs://charles_bucket`,; Cromwell would search cache hits in all of the `gs://alice_bucket`, `gs://bob_bucket` and `gs://charles_bucket` buckets without having to specify; `gs://charles_bucket` bucket explicitly in `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes`. If no `call_cache_hit_path_prefixes` are specified then all matching cache hits will be considered. ***Call cache failure logging***. When Cromwell fails to cache a job from a previous result the reason will be logged. To reduce the verbosity of the logs; only the first three failure reasons will be logged per shard of each job.

Certain Docker tags can impact call caching performance. ; Docker tags are a convenient way to point to a version of an image (`ubuntu:14.04`), or even the latest version (`ubuntu:latest`).; For that purpose, tags are mutable, meaning that the image they point to can change, while the tag name stays the same.; While this is very convenient in some cases, using mutable, or ""floating"" tags in tasks affects the reproducibility of a workflow. ; If you were to run the same workflow using `ubuntu:latest` now, and again in a year (or even in a month) may run with different docker images.; This has an even bigger impact when Call Caching is turned on in Cromwell, and could lead to un",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md:7931,log,logged,7931,docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/CallCaching.md,1,['log'],['logged']

Cromwell now supports sending metrics to [Google's Stackdriver API](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/). To use the Stackdriver instrumentation; specify this in your config:; ```hocon; services.Instrumentation {; class = ""cromwell.services.instrumentation.impl.stackdriver.StackdriverInstrumentationServiceActor"". config {; # auth scheme can be `application_default` or `service_account`; auth = ""service-account""; google-project = ""my-project""; # rate at which aggregated metrics will be sent to Stackdriver. It needs to be equal or greater than 1 minute.; # Google's Stackdriver API needs each metric to be sent not more than once per minute.; flush-rate = 1 minute; # below 3 keys are attached as labels to each metric. `cromwell-perf-test-case` is specifically meant for perf env.; cromwell-instance-role = ""role""; cromwell-perf-test-case = ""perf-test-1""; }; }; ```; The 2 label keys are optional. If specified, each metric will have label(s) added in the form of a (key, value) pair.; So for example, if `cromwell-instance-role = ""backend""` is mentioned in config, each metric data point sent to Stackdriver; will have a label (cromwell_instance_role, backend) added to it. There is another optional label that can be added to each metric. `cromwell_id` represents the identifier for different Cromwell instances.; ```hocon; # Unique Cromwell instance identifier; system.cromwell_id = ""cromwell-instance-1""; ```. ##### Metric type and Label keys naming convention; More details on the this can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/v3/metrics-details#metric-kinds).

(*) The `fingerprint` and `xxh64` strategies are features that are community supported by Cromwell's HPC community. There; is no official support from the core Cromwell team.

To change the directory where Cromwell writes workflow logs, change the directory location via the setting:. ```hocon; workflow-options {; workflow-log-dir = ""cromwell-workflow-logs""; }; ```. **Preserving Workflow Logs**. By default Cromwell erases the per workflow logs when the workflow completes to reduce disk usage. You can change this behavior by setting the following value to `false`:. ```hocon; workflow-options {; workflow-log-temporary = true; }; ```. **Exception monitoring via Sentry**. Cromwell supports [Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io) which is a service that can be used to monitor exceptions reported in an application’s logs. To enable Sentry monitoring in Cromwell, enter your DSN URL using the system property:. ```properties; sentry.dsn=DSN_URL; ```. ### Job shell configuration. Cromwell allows for system-wide or per-backend job shell configuration for running user commands rather than always; using the default `/bin/bash`. To set the job shell on a system-wide basis use the configuration key `system.job-shell` or on a; per-backend basis with `<config-key-for-backend>.job-shell`.

Note that as per the Google Secret Manager docs, the compute service account for the project in which the GCP Batch; jobs will run will need to be assigned the `Secret Manager Secret Accessor` IAM role. **Monitoring**. In order to monitor metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk usage...) about the VM during Call Runtime, a workflow option can be used to specify the path to a script that will run in the background and write its output to a log file. ```; {; ""monitoring_script"": ""gs://cromwell/monitoring/script.sh""; }; ```. The output of this script will be written to a `monitoring.log` file that will be available in the call gcs bucket when the call completes. This feature is meant to run a script in the background during long-running processes. It's possible that if the task is very short that the log file does not flush before de-localization happens and you will end up with a zero byte file. **Google Cloud Storage Filesystem**. On the Google Batch backend the GCS (Google Cloud Storage) filesystem is used for the root of the workflow execution.; On the Local, SGE, and associated backends any GCS URI will be downloaded locally. For the Google backend the `gcp_batch_gcs_root` [Workflow Option](../wf_options/Google) will take; precedence over the `root` specified at `backend.providers.JES.config.root` in the configuration file.

Testability,"rces for requests from other hog groups - even if we have jobs waiting to run that could be using them. Here are a few mental models which might be helpful to thinking about the hog factor:. - A hog factor of 2 means that ""2 greedy users would be able to hog the entire resources of Cromwell"" ; - A hog factor of 100 means ""any 1 group is only ever allowed to use 1/100th of the resources of the total Cromwell server"". ### Hog Limit. A Hog Limit is how much of a given resource a hog group is allowed use. Hog limits are not set directly; they are ; values that Cromwell calculates internally.; For example, a single hog group may be limited by Cromwell to a hog limit of 200 jobs per group. Therefore no matter how ; many workflows, sub-workflows, and jobs are queued in a greedy hog group, the whole group is limited to 200 concurrent ; running jobs. ## Configuration. Cromwell accepts the following configuration values for hog factors in the `hog-safety` stanza of `system` in the configuration ; file:; ```conf; system {; hog-safety {; hog-factor = 1; workflow-option = ""hogGroup""; token-log-interval-seconds = 0; }; }; ```. Additionally, you can override system-level hog-factor on a backend level, by setting it in the particular backend configuration like this:; ```conf; backend {; providers {; PAPIv2 {; config {; hog-factor: 2; }; }; }; }; ```. ### Setting a hog-factor. The hog factor option sets the integer described in the [Hog Factor](#hog-factor) section above.; The default value is `1` (which is equivalent to not limiting by hog group). . ### Assignment of hog groups. Within the configuration file, you can specify the workflow option that will determine the hog group. The default is; `hogGroup`. So if a workflow arrives with the following workflow options file, Cromwell will assign `hogGroupA` as the ; workflow's hog group:. ```json; {; ""hogGroup"": ""hogGroupA""; }; ```. - Any workflow option value can be used so long as it is a simple `String` value:; + You can come up wit",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md:2801,log,log-interval-seconds,2801,docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md,1,['log'],['log-interval-seconds']

For any metadata values or outputExpectations which require workflow ID (i.e, file paths), use `<<UUID>>` as a placeholder instead. For example:; * `""calls.hello.hello.stdout"": ""gs://google-project/jes/root/wdl/<<UUID>>/call-task/task-stdout.log""`. In case the absolute path the cromwell root is used (for example: `/home/my_user/projects/cromwell/cromwell-executions`); you can use `<<WORKFLOW_ROOT>>` as a replacement. ; * `""calls.hello.hello.exit_code"": ""<<WORKFLOW_ROOT>>/call-hello/execution/exit_code""`.

Testability,"return to a known ""consistent"" state.; For example, an actor waiting for a response from the database before sending information to the metadata will wait for that response before shutting itself down.; 4. All active connections from the REST endpoints are completed and closed. At this point any client that made a request before the shutdown process started should have received a response.; 5. All actors responsible for data persistence are in turn being asked to gracefully shutdown. ; For example, all queued up metadata writes are executed.; 6. Database connection pools are shutdown.; 7. Actor system shuts down.; 8. JVM exits.; ; This multi-stage process is designed to minimize the risk of data loss during shutdown. However in order to prevent this process from lasting forever, each stage (called phase) has its own timeout.; If the phase does not complete within the given timeout, actors will be forcefully stopped and the next phase will start. This logic is implemented using [Akka Coordinated Shutdown Extension](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/actors.html#coordinated-shutdown). Currently Cromwell is running [version 2.5.4](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.4/scala/actors.html#coordinated-shutdown).; It comes with a set of pre-defined phases, that can be added on and modified. Those phases can be linked together to form a Graph. Cromwell shutdown graphs looks as such:. ![Scaladoc](CromwellShutdownProcess.png). Pre-defined but unused phases have been omitted (cluster related phases for example that are irrelevant in Cromwell). You'll notice the presence of a `PhaseAbortAllWorkflows` phase. This phase is at the same level as the `PhaseServiceRequestsDone` phase which corresponds to our step #3 above.; The reason for a specific abort phase is so that its timeout can be configured differently than the normal shutdown phase.

You can change the format of the logs by setting the property to `LOG_MODE`. * In `standard` mode, your logs will be written without ANSI escape code coloring, with a layout more appropriate for server logs. * In `pretty` mode, your logs are output in a colorful, easier to read format, more appropriate for a single workflow run. The default mode for server is `standard`, while the default when running a single worklow is `pretty`. You can explicitly specify the format by running cromwell with:. ```bash; java -DLOG_MODE=pretty -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. ### Log Level. By default, Cromwell outputs messages at a `LOG_LEVEL` of `INFO`. Sometimes, you may want more or less information logged. For example, while debugging an issue you may want to increase the amount information in the logs temporarily. Alternatively, the standard level may be too verbose, and you may only want Cromwell to log warnings and errors. You can set the level via the property `LOG_LEVEL` to any one of the values: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, or `OFF`. The default log level is `INFO`. ```bash; java -DLOG_LEVEL=DEBUG -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. ## Workflow Logs. While a workflow is running, Cromwell generates a log file specifically for the workflow. After the workflow completes, to clear up local disk space, Cromwell deletes the local copy of this log file. See the [Configuration](Configuring#workflow-log-directory) section on logs for more information on preventing cromwell from deleting each workflow log. Before Cromwell deletes the files and before the workflow completes, you can configure Cromwell to copy the workflow; logs to various locations. Normally, you'll want to copy the log to a remote bucket or directory.

Testability,"s `rc` file is generated as part of the `script` within the execution directory, where the script is assembled at runtime. This is important as if the script executes successfully but the container doesn't terminate, Cromwell will continue the execution of the workflow and the container will persist hogging system resources. Within the configurations above:; - `singularity`: The exec mode does not run a container on the background. #### Cromwell: Run-in-background. By enabling Cromwell's run-in-background mode, you remove the necessity for the `kill`, `check-alive` and `job-id-regex` blocks, which disables some safety checks when running workflows:. - If there is an error starting the container or executing the script, Cromwell may not recognise this error and hang. For example, this may occur if the container attempts to exceed its allocated resources (runs out of memory); the container daemon may terminate the container without completing the script.; - If you abort the workflow (by attempting to close Cromwell or issuing an abort command), Cromwell does not have a reference to the container execution and will not be able to terminate the container. This is only necessary in local environments where there is no job manager to control this, however if your container technology can emit an identifier to stdout, then you are able to remove the run-in-background flag. . ### Next Steps.

To have this information logged on a regular basis, you can enable periodic queue logging.

Rather than starting jobs on a strict first-come first served basis, Cromwell now assigns in a round-robin; fashion between hog groups and then on a first-come-first-served *within* a hog group. In other words if the hog groups had the following entries queued up:; ```; A: jobA1, jobA2, jobA3, ..., jobA1000000; B: jobB1, jobB2; C: jobC1; D: jobD1, jobD2; ```.

While in this high I/O state the Cromwell runners will not hand out; job execution or restart check tokens, so job starts and restarts will be slowed until I/O returns to normal levels. ## Running. Installation:. Probably best done inside a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). ```shell; pip install .; ```. Usage:. ```shell; python -m backpressure_report.main <files with JSON formatted Logs Explorer logs>; ```. The program parses JSON-formatted Google Logs Explorer logs JSON looking for backpressure messages.; The Logs Explorer query should look like the following:. ```; resource.labels.container_name=""cromwell1-runner-app""; (jsonPayload.message=~""IoActor backpressure off"" OR jsonPayload.message=~""Beginning IoActor backpressure""); ```. Multiple input files may be required to capture logging output from an entire interval of interest since Google imposes; limits on the number of log entries that can be exported from a single query.

Call cache failures are no longer sent to the workflow metadata. Instead a limited number of call cache failure messages; will be sent to the workflow log. See [the Cromwell call caching; documentation](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cromwell_features/CallCaching/) for more information on call; cache failure logging. ## 44 Release Notes. ### Improved PAPI v2 Preemptible VM Support. In some cases PAPI v2 will report the preemption of a VM in a way that differs from PAPI v1. This novel means of reporting; preemption was not recognized by Cromwell's PAPI v2 backend and would result in preemptions being miscategorized as call failures.; Cromwell's PAPI v2 backend will now handle this type of preemption. ## 43 Release Notes. ### Virtual Private Cloud with Subnetworks.

To change the directory where Cromwell writes workflow logs, change the directory location via the setting:. ```hocon; workflow-options {; workflow-log-dir = ""cromwell-workflow-logs""; }; ```. **Preserving Workflow Logs**. By default Cromwell erases the per workflow logs when the workflow completes to reduce disk usage. You can change this behavior by setting the following value to `false`:. ```hocon; workflow-options {; workflow-log-temporary = true; }; ```. **Exception monitoring via Sentry**. Cromwell supports [Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io) which is a service that can be used to monitor exceptions reported in an application’s logs. To enable Sentry monitoring in Cromwell, enter your DSN URL using the system property:. ```properties; sentry.dsn=DSN_URL; ```. ### Job shell configuration. Cromwell allows for system-wide or per-backend job shell configuration for running user commands rather than always; using the default `/bin/bash`. To set the job shell on a system-wide basis use the configuration key `system.job-shell` or on a; per-backend basis with `<config-key-for-backend>.job-shell`. For example:. ```; # system-wide setting, all backends get this; -Dsystem.job-shell=/bin/sh; ```. ```; # override for just the Local backend; -Dbackend.providers.Local.config.job-shell=/bin/sh; ```.

On Google Pipelines API v2, a worker VM that is preempted may emit a generic error message like; ```; PAPI error code 10. The assigned worker has failed to complete the operation; ```; instead of a preemption-specific message like; ```; PAPI error code 14. Task was preempted for the 2nd time.; ```; Cromwell 44 introduced special handling that detects both preemption indicators and re-runs the job consistent with the `preemptible` setting. Cromwell 46 enhances this handling in response to user reports of possible continued issues. ## 45 Release Notes. ### Improved input and output transfer performance on PAPI v2. Cromwell now requires only a single PAPI ""action"" each for the entire localization or delocalization process, rather than two per file or directory.; This greatly increases execution speed for jobs with large numbers of input or output files.; In testing, total execution time for a call with 800 inputs improved from more than 70 minutes to less than 20 minutes. ### List dependencies flag in Womtool Command Line [(#5098)](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/5098).

The data directory in the MySQL container is [mounted to `compose/mysql/data`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/develop/scripts/docker-compose-mysql/compose/mysql/init), which allows the data to survive a `docker-compose down`. To disable this feature, simply remove the `./compose/mysql/data:/var/lib/mysql` line in the [volume section of `docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/scripts/docker-compose-mysql/docker-compose.yml). Note that in such case, the data will still be preserved by a `docker-compose stop` that stops the container but doesn't delete it. **Notes**. To run Cromwell in the background, add `-d` at the end of the command:; `docker-compose up -d`. To then see the logs for a specific service, run `docker-compose logs -f <service>`. ; For example `docker-compose logs -f cromwell`.

The job is launched with a configurable script command such as:. ```; chmod 755 ${script}; cat > ${cwd}/execution/submitFile <<EOF; Iwd=${cwd}/execution; requirements=${nativeSpecs}; leave_in_queue=true; request_memory=${memory_mb}; request_disk=${disk_kb}; error=${err}; output=${out}; log_xml=true; request_cpus=${cpu}; executable=${script}; log=${cwd}/execution/execution.log; queue; EOF; condor_submit ${cwd}/execution/submitFile; ```. The HtCondor backend gets the job ID from parsing the `submit.stdout` text file. Since the `script.sh` ends with `echo $? > rc`, the backend will wait for the existence of this file, parse out the return code and determine success or failure and then subsequently post-process. The command used to submit the job is specified under the configuration key `backend.providers.HtCondor.config.submit`. It uses the same syntax as a command in WDL, and will be provided the variables:. * `script` - A shell script of the job to be run. This contains the user's command from the `command` section of the WDL code.; * `cwd` - The path where the script should be run.; * `out` - The path to the stdout.; * `err` - The path to the stderr.; * `job_name` - A unique name for the job.

Users reported cases where Life Sciences jobs failed due to insufficient quota, instead of queueing and waiting until; quota is available (which is the expected behavior). Cromwell will now retry under these conditions, which present with errors; such as ""PAPI error code 9"", ""no available zones"", and/or ""quota too low"". ### Database. #### New table 'GROUP_METRICS_ENTRY'. A new table called `GROUP_METRICS_ENTRY` has been added. The purpose of this table is to track when a group or billing project last ran into Cloud Quota exhaustion. #### Index removal. The `IX_WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY_WS` index is removed from `WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY`. The index had low cardinality and workflow pickup is faster without it. Migration time depends on workflow store size, but should be very fast for most installations. Terminal workflows are removed from the workflow store, so only running workflows contribute to the cost. ### Bug fi",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:2442,log,log,2442,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['log'],['log']
Testability,"tion Bug. As outlined in the [WDL Spec](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/main/versions/1.0/SPEC.md#prepending-a-string-to-an-optional-parameter), concatenating a string with an empty optional now correctly evaluates to the empty string. ### Removals. #### `RESTAPI.md` docs discontinued. Due to deprecation of the underlying library, Markdown docs will no longer be generated from the Cromwell API Swagger. The recommended alternative is starting a server and viewing the Swagger directly. #### Removed Docker Hub health check. Cromwell's healthcheck requests to Docker Hub were not authenticated, and thus became subject to rate limiting. To eliminate these false alarms, this functionality has been removed. The config key `services.HealthMonitor.config.check-dockerhub` is therefore obsolete. There is no change to any other usage of Docker Hub. #### Removed GCS health check. Cromwell's health check of GCS has been removed. GCS does not have availability issues of note, and in typical configurations the check does not meaningfully test Cromwell's permissions. The config keys `services.HealthMonitor.config.check-gcs` and `.gcs-bucket-to-check` are therefore obsolete. #### Removed Genomics Backend code; Code relating to the Google Genomics API (aka `v1Alpha`) has been removed since Google has entirely disabled that service.; Cloud Life Sciences (aka `v2Beta`, deprecated) and Google Batch (aka `batch`, recommended) remain the two viable GCP backends. ## 87 Release Notes. ### GCP Batch. * Added Nvidia driver install (default 418) ([#7235](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7235})); * Fixed Docker mounting volumes with extra colon ([#7240](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7240)); * Fixed issue with multiple zones defined in config ([#7240](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7240)); * Fixed Batch label regex ([#7355](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/7355)). ### Progress toward WDL 1.1 Support.

In this section we will install the Cromwell Workflow Management system and configure it, so it can use the local scratch device on the compute nodes.; (these installations are done in a ```centos 8``` enviornment). ### 1. In order to install Cromwell, the `sbt` build tool is required, so we will install this now. ##### a. Add the sbt online repository. ```hocon; dnf config-manager --add-repo https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-rpm.repo; ```. ##### b. Install SBT build tool. ```hocon; dnf -y install sbt; ```. ### 2. Now we can download Cromwell from git repository. ##### a. Create a directory into which we will install Cromwell. ```hocon; mkdir cromwell; ```. ##### b. Now, we set the owner of that directory to the cromwell user and group and change the permissions in order to allow access to all users. ```hocon; chmod 775 -R cromwell; chown -R cromwell:cromwell cromwell; ```. ##### c. Login to the cromwell user account. ```hocon; su - cromwell; ```. ##### d. We will now use git to clone the Cromwell git repository. ```hocon; cd cromwell; git clone https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell.git; ```. ##### e. This guide was tested and validated with `version 52` of cromwell, so we will checkout that version. ```hocon; cd cromwell; git checkout 52; ```. ### 3. We will now configure Cromwell to use the local NVMe disk as scratch space. ##### a. Open the `backend/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/RuntimeEnvironment.scala` file for editing. ##### b. Comment out line 3, so it reads:. ```hocon; //import java.util.UUID; ```. ##### c.

This strategy works with containers.; * `fingerprint` (community-supported*) tries to create a fingerprint for each file by taking its last modified time (milliseconds since; epoch in hexadecimal) + size (bytes in hexadecimal) + the xxh64 sum of the first 10 MB** of the file. ; It is much more lightweight than the hash based options while still unique enough that collisions are unlikely. This ; strategy works well for workflows that generate multi-gigabyte files and where hashing these files on the ; cromwell instance provides CPU or I/O problems. ; NOTE: This strategy requires hard-linking as a dupliation strategy, as copying changes the last modified time. (*) The `fingerprint` and `xxh64` strategies are features that are community supported by Cromwell's HPC community. There; is no official support from the core Cromwell team. (**) This value is configurable.; ; ### Workflow log directory. To change the directory where Cromwell writes workflow logs, change the directory location via the setting:. ```hocon; workflow-options {; workflow-log-dir = ""cromwell-workflow-logs""; }; ```. **Preserving Workflow Logs**. By default Cromwell erases the per workflow logs when the workflow completes to reduce disk usage. You can change this behavior by setting the following value to `false`:. ```hocon; workflow-options {; workflow-log-temporary = true; }; ```. **Exception monitoring via Sentry**. Cromwell supports [Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io) which is a service that can be used to monitor exceptions reported in an application’s logs. To enable Sentry monitoring in Cromwell, enter your DSN URL using the system property:. ```properties; sentry.dsn=DSN_URL; ```. ### Job shell configuration.

Testability,"un the tests from another terminal. ## Running. There are two ways to invoke the integration tests:. * `sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / test""` - compiles Centaur and runs all tests via sbt directly. Tests are expected to be in the `centaur/src/main/standardTestCases` directory. This can be changed by modifying `reference.conf`. * `src/ci/bin/testCentaurLocal.sh` - runs the same tests using the continuous integration pipeline configuration. * Tests that require different Cromwell and Centaur configurations can be invoked by calling the various scripts in `src/ci/bin`. ### Tags. All tests are tagged with their name and their TESTFORMAT, and also any custom tags specified in the `.test` file. Tag names are all lower case, so a test named ""tagFoo"" has a tag ""tagfoo"". To run only those tests which have been tagged with a specified tag `tagFoo`:; ```; sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / testOnly * -- -n tagfoo""; ```. Or to instead exclude all tests which have been tagged with a specified tag `tagFoo`:; ```; sbt ""centaur / IntegrationTest / testOnly * -- -l tagfoo""; ```. ## Adding custom tests. You can add your own tests to the test suite by adding `-Dcentaur.optionalTestPath=DIR` on your sbt invocation, ; e.g. `sbt -Dcentaur.optionalTestPath=/some/path/to/tests test`. The value of `DIR` is expected to be a directory; which contains one or more test case files.; ; The same result can be achieved more permanently by adding the custom directory into the `application.conf` file directly: ; ```; centaur {; optionalTestPath = ""/some/path/to/tests""; }; ```. ## Defining test cases. Each test case file is a HOCON file with the following structure:; ```; name: NAME // Required: Name of the test; testFormat: TESTFORMAT // Required: One of WorkflowSuccessTest, WorkflowFailureTest, runtwiceexpectingcallcaching; backends: [BACKENDNAME1, BACKENDNAME2, ...] // Optional list of backends.

If **- and ONLY if -** you have metadata archiving turned on, then for a workflow whose metadata has been archived by Cromwell; according to the lifecycle policy, Cromwell will no longer add new labels or update existing labels for this workflow; coming through PATCH `/labels` endpoint. ## 60 Release Notes. ### Java 11. As of this version, a distribution of Java 11 is required to run Cromwell. Cromwell is developed, tested, and; containerized using [AdoptOpenJDK 11 HotSpot](https://adoptopenjdk.net/). ### Hybrid metadata storage (""carboniting"") removed. Carboniting functionality has been removed from Cromwell.; There will be no effect for customers who store metadata permanently in the relational database (most common),; and there will also be no effect for customers who use the in-memory database. Breaking change only for customers who explicitly enabled `carbonite-metadata-service` in their configuration to split; metadata storage between a relational database and Google Cloud Storage.

To run Singularity on a job scheduler, the singularity command needs to be passed to the scheduler as a wrapped command. For example, in SLURM, we can use the normal SLURM configuration as explained in the [SLURM documentation](../backends/SLURM), however we'll add a `submit-docker` block to execute when a task is tagged with a docker container. . When constructing this block, there are a few things to keep in mind:; - Make sure Singularity is loaded (and in PATH). If `module` is installed for ; example you can call `module load Singularity`. If the cluster admin has made; a Singularity module available. Alternatively you can alter the `PATH` ; variable directly or simply use `/path/to/singularity` ; directly in the config.; - We should treat worker nodes as if they do not have stable access to the ; internet or build access, so we will pull the container before the task is ; submit to the cluster.; - It's a good idea to use a Singularity cache so that same images should only; have to be pulled once. Make sure you set the `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` ; environment variable to a location on the filesystem that is reachable by the; worker nodes!; - If we are using a cache we need to ensure that submit processes started by; Cromwell do not pull to the same cache at the same time. This may corrupt the; cache. We can prevent this by implementing a filelock with `flock` and ; pulling the image before the job is submitted.

Comparison to the default in-memory database:; Advantages:. * Much less memory needed.; * Call-caching enabled. Disadvantages:. * Slower. ### Abort. **Control-C (SIGINT) abort handler**. For backends that support aborting jobs, Cromwell can be configured to automatically try to abort all calls when it receives a Control-C, also known as SIGINT. All currently running calls will also set their status to `Aborted`. To explicitly turn this feature on or off, set the configuration option:. ```hocon; system {; abort-jobs-on-terminate=true; }; ```. Or, via `-Dsystem.abort-jobs-on-terminate=true` command line option. By default, this value is false when running `java -jar cromwell.jar server`, and true when running `java -jar cromwell.jar run <workflow source> <inputs>`. Read the [Abort](execution/ExecutionTwists/#abort) section to learn more about how abort works. ### Call caching. Call Caching allows Cromwell to detect when a job has been run in the past so it doesn't have to re-compute results. ; To learn more see [Call Caching](cromwell_features/CallCaching). To enable Call Caching, add the following to your Cromwell configuration:. ```; call-caching {; enabled = true; invalidate-bad-cache-results = true; }; ```. When `call-caching.enabled=true` (default: `false`), Cromwell will be able to to reference or copy results from previously run jobs (when appropriate).; When `invalidate-bad-cache-results=true` (default: `true`), Cromwell will invalidate any cache results which contain files that cannot be accessed within a cache-hit. This is usually desired, but might be unwanted if this failure occurs for external reasons, such as a difference in user authentication. Cromwell also accepts [Workflow Options](wf_options/Overview#call-caching-options) to override the cache read/write behavior. . ### Loc",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md:16785,learn,learn,16785,docs/Configuring.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Configuring.md,1,['learn'],['learn']

Cromwell running in server mode accepts all connections on the configured webservice port. Without taking additional measures to protect your Cromwell server, this can leave your Cromwell server and therefore all information stored by and accessible by your Cromwell server vulnerable to anyone who is able to access the server. For instance, an unprotected Cromwell server running against the [Google Cloud backend](backends/Google) would leave you vulnerable to outside users running workflows that will cost you money, and potentially access the data files you use within your workflows!. The simplest way to restrict access is by putting an authenticating proxy server in between users and the Cromwell server: . 1. Configure a firewall rule on the Cromwell server host to deny access to the webservice port (e.g. 8000) from all addresses except a secure proxy host. ; 2. Configure `<YourFavoriteWebProxy>` on the proxy host with `<YourFavoriteAuthMechanism>`, to proxy authenticated traffic from the world to the Cromwell server. Using Apache `httpd` web server for example with basic `htpassword` file-based authentication, the configuration might look something like:. ```Apache; <Location /cromwell>; Order deny,allow; Allow from all; AuthType Basic; AuthName ""Password Required""; AuthUserFile /path/to/my/htpasswdfile; Require user someone someoneelse; ProxyPass http://101.101.234.567:8000 # address of cromwell server web service; </Location>; ```.

Usability,"# HTTP Inputs. ## Overview. For shared filesystem and Google Pipelines API (PAPI) version 2 backends Cromwell can support workflow inputs specified by `http` and `https` URLs.; Please note this is not true ""filesystem"" support for HTTP URLs;; if inputs to a workflow are specified by HTTP URLs the outputs of steps will nevertheless appear at local or GCS paths and not HTTP; URLs. ### Configuration. Cromwell's default configuration defines an instance of the HTTP filesystem named `http`. There is no additional configuration; required for the HTTP filesystem itself so adding HTTP filesystem support to a backend is a simple as; adding a reference to this filesystem within the backend's `filesystems` stanza. e.g. Cromwell's default `Local` shared filesystem; backend is configured like this (a PAPI version 2 backend would be configured in a similar way):. ```; backend {; default = ""Local""; providers {; Local {; ...; config {; filesystems {; local {; ...; }; http { }; }; }; ...; }; ...; }; }; ```. If there is a need to turn off this `http` filesystem in the default `Local` backend the following Java property; allows for this: `-Dbackend.providers.Local.config.filesystems.http.enabled=false`. ### Caveats. Using HTTP inputs in Cromwell can produce some unexpected behavior:; - Files specified by HTTP URIs will be renamed locally, so programs that rely on file extensions or other filenaming conventions may not function properly.; - Files located in the same remote HTTP-defined directory will not be colocated locally. This can cause problems if a program is expecting an index file (e.g. `.fai`) to appear in the same directory as the associated data file (e.g. `.fa`) without specifying the index location.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/HTTP.md:621,simpl,simple,621,docs/filesystems/HTTP.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/HTTP.md,1,['simpl'],['simple']
Usability,"# Hog Factors. ## Introduction. Cromwell has only a finite amount of resources at its disposal. WDL workflows allow scattered tasks to be; run a huge number of times with very simple syntax.; This makes it easy for a very small number of workflows to hog all of the resources of Cromwell, forcing all other ; workflows (even a simple 'hello_world') to wait in line behind them. ; Sometimes that's exactly what you want, but often you would like Cromwell to remain responsive to new users' small ; workflows even while continuing to process production workflows from established users. Cromwell 35 provides new ways of stopping one workflow or group of workflows from locking out everyone else by ; introducing hog factors, hog groups and hog limits. This page describes what they are and how they work. ## Concepts. ### Hog Group . The Hog Group is a way of grouping workflow from different submissions together to restrain their overall resource ; usage as a whole. - Every top-level workflow is assigned to a hog group when Cromwell receives it. ; + Exactly how this happens is [configurable](#configuration).; - Every sub-workflow or call started by a workflow is associated with the same hog group as its parent workflow.; - Multiple top-level workflows can be assigned to the same hog group to allow them to be grouped together. Thus:. - Every workflow is assigned to a hog group when submitted.; - Every hog group may have many workflows assigned to it. ### Hog Factor. The hog factor is an integer greater than or equal to 1. It represents a trade-off between: . - Fully utilizing all resources available to Cromwell to complete jobs, for as long as there are jobs to be processed.; - Reserving resources for requests from other hog groups - even if we have jobs waiting to run that could be using them. Here are a few mental models which might be helpful to thinking about the hog factor:. - A hog factor of 2 means that ""2 greedy users would be able to hog the entire resources of Cromwell"" ;",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md:176,simpl,simple,176,docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md,3,"['responsiv', 'simpl']","['responsive', 'simple']"
Usability,"# Workflow Execution: Database Tables: Workflow, Subworkflow, and Job Stores. ## Database Tables: Workflow, Subworkflow, and Job Stores. Cromwell uses the workflow, subworkflow and job store tables to hold data related to submitted or running workflows.; Once a workflow reaches a terminal state all data for that workflow should be deleted from these tables. ### Workflow Store / `WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY`. `WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY` holds data received in a workflow submission (workflow sources, inputs, options etc.); and workflow-scoped execution data (e.g. submission time, status, fields to support; running [Horizontal Cromwell](../horicromtal.md) etc). ### Job Store / `JOB_STORE_ENTRY`. `JOB_STORE_ENTRY` holds data for *completed* jobs within a workflow. Jobs that are still running or have not yet been; started will not have rows in this table. The main purpose of the job store table is to support resuming execution of; a workflow when Cromwell is restarted by recovering the outputs of completed jobs. This table is closely related to; `JOB_STORE_SIMPLETON_ENTRY` which holds the [simpleton](../general/simpletons.md) values comprising a job's outputs,; and loosely related to the [job key/value store (`JOB_KEY_VALUE_ENTRY`)](jobKeyValueStore.md) which holds other; job-scoped data important in recovering jobs on Cromwell restart. ### Subworkflow Store / `SUB_WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY`. `SUB_WORKFLOW_STORE_ENTRY` holds data for subworkflows that have begun execution. The rows in this table persist the fact; that particular subworkflows corresponding to a call FQN and index were started and assigned a workflow ID.; The completed jobs within these subworkflows will be recorded in the job store described above, linking to the; subworkflows in this table by the subworkflow's ID.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/bitesize/workflowExecution/workflowSubworkflowAndJobStores.md:1090,simpl,simpleton,1090,docs/developers/bitesize/workflowExecution/workflowSubworkflowAndJobStores.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/bitesize/workflowExecution/workflowSubworkflowAndJobStores.md,4,['simpl'],"['simpleton', 'simpletons']"

This page provides run-throughs to give insight into how the; [Execution Store](executionStore.md) and [Value Store](valueStore.md) work in; practice in some example situations. . ## Handling a single task call. To begin, consider this simple workflow. It has a single task call whose; result is exposed as an output String:. ```wdl; version 1.0. workflow single_task_workflow {; call single_task; ; output {; String string_out = single_task.string_out; }; }. task single_task {; command {; echo hello; }; output {; String string_out = ""hello""; }; }; ```. The **Execution Store** will keep track of statuses as the workflow runs:. | | `single_task` | `string_out` |; |---|---|---|; |1|`NotStarted`|`NotStarted`|; |2|`QueuedInCromwell`|`NotStarted`|; |3|`Starting`|`NotStarted`|; |4|`Running`|`NotStarted`|; |5|`Done`|`NotStarted`|; |6|`Done`|`Running`|; |7|`Done`|`Done`|. In step 1, the workflow has just started and the ExecutionStore is created in its initial; state. The Value Store doesn't track statuses and so begins empty: `{ }`. In steps 2-4, the Execution Store tracks the `single_task` job as the engine is executing it. As the Execution Store is updated to indicate task completion is step 5, the Value Store is also updated to; include the output value of the task:; ```json; {; ""single_task.string_out"": ""hello""; }; ```. By step 6, Cromwell can use the fact that the task is complete to decide that the output node is ready to be; evaluated. And the input to the output expression is available for lookup in the Value Store. In step 7, all workflow nodes have run and the workflow is complete. The Value Store is updated once again to; additionally contain the output node value:; ```json; {; ""single_task.string_out"": ""hello"",; ""string_out"": ""hello""; }; ``` .

It is likely we will have suggestions about how to proceed. It's also possible, though hopefully rare, that there is a hidden impediment that would prevent your solution from working. If we spot it at the idea stage, we can give you feedback much earlier than if we have to reject your pull request!. #### Maintenance considerations; The Cromwell team at Broad maintains and enhances the application to serve the needs of both Broad Institute and external users. Sometimes, we may identify a feature idea or pull request that works and is a good idea, but we may be unable to commit to maintaining it indefinitely. This may be because it does not align with the strategic direction of the project, or simply due to time constraints on the maintainers. Once again, it always helps to solicit early feedback. #### Reviewing pull requests; Because pull requests require a substantial amount of time to review carefully, we prioritize and schedule them into our sprints alongside all of our other work. At present, the team operates on three-week sprints so if you happen to submit a PR early on in the sprint it may be a while before a team member has a chance to look at it.

First off, here are useful links:. * Cromwell documentation: [cromwell.readthedocs.io](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io); * Source on Github: [github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/develop/docs); * Builds on ReadTheDocs: [readthedocs.org/projects/cromwell](https://readthedocs.org/projects/cromwell/builds/); * How to build and view the documentation locally: [mkdocs.readthedocs.io](https://mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#installation). ### Writing Tips. 1. Keep it clear, accurate, and concise.; 2. Put the most important information first.; 3. Use the second person, use “you” instead of “the user”.; 4. No passive verbs (everything is done by something).; 5. Link to the original source, don't repeat documentation. . ### Formatting. The documentation is written in Markdown. Click here for a [Github Guide on Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and click here for more [tips from MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/). ### Styling. **Links:**. * Absolute: `[link text](www.destinationURL.com)`; _Example:_ `[Broad Institute](www.broadinstitute.org)` _produces this link_ [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org).; * Relative: `[link text](Destination_Page)`, where `Destination_Page` is the file name without the `.md` extension ; _Example:_ `[How to use the Cromwell CLI](CommandLine)` _produces this link_ [How to use the Cromwell CLI](CommandLine).; * Anchor link: `[anchor text](../Path/To/Page#Anchor)` ; _Example:_ `[HPC filesystems](backends/HPC#filesystems)` _produces this link_ [HPC filesystems](backends/HPC#filesystems). **Code:**. * To style a word of code, use a backtick (\`) before and after the word. ; _Examp",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/Contribute.md:166,guid,guidelines,166,docs/developers/Contribute.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/Contribute.md,2,"['clear', 'guid']","['clear', 'guidelines']"

Usability,"**Local Backend**. The local backend will simply launch a subprocess for each job invocation and wait for it to produce a Return Code file (rc file) which will contain the exit code of the job's command.; It is pre-enabled by default and there is no further configuration needed to start using it. It uses the local filesystem on which Cromwell is running to store the workflow directory structure. You can find the complete set of configurable settings with explanations in the ; [Cromwell Example Configuration File][cromwell-examples-conf],; along with backend provider examples in the [Example Providers Folder][cromwell-examples-folder]. The Local backend makes use of the same generic configuration as HPC backends. The same [filesystem considerations](HPC#filesystems) apply. **Note to OSX users**: Docker on Mac restricts the directories that can be mounted. Only some directories are allowed by default.; If you try to mount a volume from a disallowed directory, jobs can fail in an odd manner. Before mounting a directory make sure it is in the list; of allowed directories. See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#namespaces) for how to configure those directories.

Usability,"**Warning!**. - Cromwell is NOT on its own a security appliance!; - Only YOU are responsible for your own security! ; - Please be sure to check with your security team before setting up your Cromwell server; - Some recommendations and suggestions on security can be found below. __This is intended as helpful guidance only, and is not endorsed by the Broad Institute.__. Cromwell running in server mode accepts all connections on the configured webservice port. Without taking additional measures to protect your Cromwell server, this can leave your Cromwell server and therefore all information stored by and accessible by your Cromwell server vulnerable to anyone who is able to access the server. For instance, an unprotected Cromwell server running against the [Google Cloud backend](backends/Google) would leave you vulnerable to outside users running workflows that will cost you money, and potentially access the data files you use within your workflows!. The simplest way to restrict access is by putting an authenticating proxy server in between users and the Cromwell server: . 1. Configure a firewall rule on the Cromwell server host to deny access to the webservice port (e.g. 8000) from all addresses except a secure proxy host. ; 2. Configure `<YourFavoriteWebProxy>` on the proxy host with `<YourFavoriteAuthMechanism>`, to proxy authenticated traffic from the world to the Cromwell server. Using Apache `httpd` web server for example with basic `htpassword` file-based authentication, the configuration might look something like:. ```Apache; <Location /cromwell>; Order deny,allow; Allow from all; AuthType Basic; AuthName ""Password Required""; AuthUserFile /path/to/my/htpasswdfile; Require user someone someoneelse; ProxyPass http://101.101.234.567:8000 # address of cromwell server web service; </Location>; ```. Users now hit `http://my.proxy.org/cromwell` with authenticated requests, and they're forwarded to port 8000 on the Cromwell server host. . **Multiple Servers on one Host",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/Security.md:309,guid,guidance,309,docs/developers/Security.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/Security.md,1,['guid'],['guidance']
Usability,". While the AWS SDK v2 has nio capabilities, it does not include; a FileSystemProvider to allow Cromwell to operate seamlessly with AWS S3.; This was found later in the project, and as such, the filesystem provider; is not integrated with the Cromwell configuration system. The S3 FS was; forked from Udacity's provider, which was based on AWS SDK for Java version 1.; Of particular note is the fact that all API configuration for the provider; is performed through environment variables. As such, configuration is possible,; but currently disjoint from Cromwell proper. Authentication; --------------. Authentication is required for both the Cromwell AWS Backend and the S3; Filesystem provider. By default, in both cases, the default credential provider; chain is followed. AWS tools all follow the same prioritized set of; checks for access key/secret key (and optionally token), with the exception; of #2 below.

Normally customers will be using an EC2 Instance role (recommended) or file configuration; as described in #3 (not recommended in production). Permissions; -----------. Within AWS, everything must be authorized. This is a consistent rule, and as; such, AWS Services themselves are not immune to the rule. Therefore, customers; of AWS are responsible for granting services access to APIs within their account.; The flow described below represents the permissions needed by each stage, from ; Cromwell server through the task running.

Usability,"; Cromwell can be thought of as performing three fundamental roles:. 1. Front end - handling all REST requests; 1. Runner - picking up and running workflows; 1. Summarizer - summarizing metadata. In the simplest Cromwell deployment, a single Cromwell instance performs all three of these roles.; But it is also possible to create Cromwell deployments with many Cromwell instances, gaining advantages in; resiliency and scalability. There is only one restriction on roles: there must be exactly one Cromwell; instance performing the role of summarizer. Apart from this restriction, any instance in a multi-Cromwell; deployment can perform one or more of these roles. As a real world example, the current production Terra; deployment uses 7 Cromwell instances, each dedicated to a single role: 3 front ends, 3 runners, and one summarizer. These roles are not explicit in Cromwell configuration, rather they are implied by configuration settings as; described below. ** Summarizer configuration **. The frequency of metadata summarization is determined by the value for the configuration key; `services.MetadataService.config.metadata-summary-refresh-interval`, which has a default value of `1 second`.; As stated above, there must be exactly one Cromwell instance performing the role of summarizer, so; all Cromwell instances which are not performing the summarizer role should specify `Inf` for this value. ** Runner configuration **. Cromwell instances in the runner role should periodically scan the workflow store to pick up and run; unclaimed workflows. The relevant configuration parameters are described below along with their default values.; The default values may be adequate for instances in the runner role, but will need to be overridden for; non-runner instances to effectively turn running off. ```hocon; system {; ...; # Number of seconds between polls of the workflow store.; # Set this to a very large value for non-runners (e.g. 999999); new-workflow-poll-rate = 20. # Cromwell will l",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Scaling.md:203,simpl,simplest,203,docs/Scaling.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/Scaling.md,1,['simpl'],['simplest']

The rules for call caching in HPC backends are:; * `docker`: Will be considered when call caching.; * Memory options: Will *not* be considered when call caching.; * CPU options: Will *not* be considered when call caching.; * Custom Attributes: Will *not* be considered when call caching (by default).; ; Although custom attributes will not be considered when call caching by default, you can override this in a `runtime-attributes-for-caching` section. Eg:; ```hocon; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; String sge_queue = ""short""; String singularity_image; # ...; """"""; runtime-attributes-for-caching {; sge_queue: false; singularity_image: true; }; }; ```. * Note: Only *custom* attributes can be altered like this. Memory, CPU and docker will always have their default cache-consideration behavior.; * Note: Unlike memory, cpu and docker attributes which inherit validation and hash-lookup behavior, any custom attributes will be simple primitive comparisons.; * For example, a `docker` attribute will be cached by looking up docker hashes against a docker repository, but a custom `singularity` attribute would be a primitive string match. #### How Cromwell should start an HPC job. When Cromwell runs a task, it will fill in a template for the job using the declared runtime attributes. This specific template will vary depending on the requirements of your HPC cluster. For example, say you normally submit jobs to SGE using:. ```bash; qsub -terse -V -b y -N my_job_name \; -wd /path/to/working_directory \; -o /path/to/stdout.qsub \; -e /path/to/stderr.qsub \; -pe smp 1 -l mem_free=0.5g -q short \; /usr/bin/env bash myScript.bash; ```. For this particular SGE cluster, the above sets the working directory, stdout and stderr paths, the number of cpus to 1, the memory to half a gigabyte, and runs on the short queue.

Within the `*.conf` file, you have a number of options to change the Cromwell's interaction with AWS Batch. ### Filesystems; > More information about filesystems can be found on the [Filesystems page](/filesystems/Filesystems/).; > . Amazon's S3 storage is a supported filesystem in both the engine and backend, this means that S3 files can be referenced at a workflow level, and as input files, provided they are prefixed by `'s3://'`. * filesystems; * filesystems.s3.auth; * filesystems.s3.caching.duplication-strategy. ### Configuring Authentication. To allow Cromwell to talk to AWS, the `default` authentication scheme uses the [default authentication provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html) with the following AWS search paths:; - Environment Variables - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`; - Java system properties - `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretKey`; - Default credential profiles file - Created by the AWS CLI, typically located at `~/.aws/credentials`; - _Instance profile credentials_ - Only relevant on EC2 instances. ### Allowing private Docker containers. AWS Batch allows the use of private Docker containers by providing `dockerhub` credentials. Under the specific backend's configuration, you can provide the following object:. ```hocon; (backend.providers.AWSBatch.config.)dockerhub = {; // account = """"; // token = """"; }; ```. ### More configuration options. * `(backend.providers.AWSBatch.config.)concurrent-job-limit` specifies the number of jobs that Cromwell will allow to be running in AWS at the same time.

Usability,"atabase:; Advantages:. * Much less memory needed.; * Call-caching enabled. Disadvantages:. * Slower. ### Abort. **Control-C (SIGINT) abort handler**. For backends that support aborting jobs, Cromwell can be configured to automatically try to abort all calls when it receives a Control-C, also known as SIGINT. All currently running calls will also set their status to `Aborted`. To explicitly turn this feature on or off, set the configuration option:. ```hocon; system {; abort-jobs-on-terminate=true; }; ```. Or, via `-Dsystem.abort-jobs-on-terminate=true` command line option. By default, this value is false when running `java -jar cromwell.jar server`, and true when running `java -jar cromwell.jar run <workflow source> <inputs>`. Read the [Abort](execution/ExecutionTwists/#abort) section to learn more about how abort works. ### Call caching. Call Caching allows Cromwell to detect when a job has been run in the past so it doesn't have to re-compute results. ; To learn more see [Call Caching](cromwell_features/CallCaching). To enable Call Caching, add the following to your Cromwell configuration:. ```; call-caching {; enabled = true; invalidate-bad-cache-results = true; }; ```. When `call-caching.enabled=true` (default: `false`), Cromwell will be able to to reference or copy results from previously run jobs (when appropriate).; When `invalidate-bad-cache-results=true` (default: `true`), Cromwell will invalidate any cache results which contain files that cannot be accessed within a cache-hit. This is usually desired, but might be unwanted if this failure occurs for external reasons, such as a difference in user authentication. Cromwell also accepts [Workflow Options](wf_options/Overview#call-caching-options) to override the cache read/write behavior. . ### Local filesystem options.

These next two examples are are equivalent. _JSON-like stanza:_. ```hocon; include required(classpath(""application"")); webservice {; port = 8000; interface = 0.0.0.0; }; ```. _Dot-separated values:_. ```hocon; include required(classpath(""application"")); webservice.port = 8000; webservice.interface = 0.0.0.0; ```. ## Configuration via command line. In addition to using configuration files, you can use dot-separated configuration names to specify values directly on the Java command line:. ```; $ java -Dwebservice.port=8080 cromwell.jar ...; ```. ## Advanced configuration. **WARNING:** These advanced configuration values can significantly affect the performance of Cromwell. . ### Server. By default the Cromwell server will bind to `0.0.0.0` on port `8000`. ; You can then access it through a browser at `http://localhost:8000`. ; To change these settings, simply edit the following values in your configuration file:. ```; webservice {; port = 9000; interface = 0.0.0.0; }; ```. The above configuration will use port `9000`. Cromwell uses `akka-http` to serve requests. For more advanced configuration settings, refer to the [akka-http](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/configuration.html) documentation. For example, to increase the request timeout to 30 seconds you can add this stanza to your configuration file:. ```; akka.http.server.request-timeout = 30s; ```. ### I/O. **I/O Throttling**. Certain [backends](backends/Backends) impose I/O limits. For example the Pipelines API imposes a quota on the number of queries that can be made per second. You can effectively control and throttle the number of requests and resources allocated to those operations in the `system.io` configuration:. ```; system.io {; number-of-requests = 100000; per = 100 seconds; }; ```. **I/O Resilience**.

By default, the Cromwell ID is `cromid-<7_digit_random_hex>`.; A custom identifier may replace the ""cromid"" portion of the string. For example:. ```hocon; system {; cromwell_id = ""main""; }; ```. This would generates a `cromwell_id` of `main-<7_digit_random_hex>`. Each time Cromwell restarts the random part of the; ID will change, however the `main` prefix would remain the same. If the random part of the Cromwell ID should not be generated, set the configuration value:. ```hocon; system {; cromwell_id_random_suffix = false; }; ```. **Heartbeat TTL**.

In order to assign labels to a workflow, the first step is to create a JSON file with key-value pairs that define a label. For the example above, the labels JSON should look like:. ```; {; ""project"":""diabetes-cohort""; }; ```. When choosing key-value pairs, it's important to make sure you're adhering to Cromwell supported label syntax below. . There are two ways to add labels to a workflow: ; 1. Upon workflow submission set the `labels` parameter of the Submit endpoint, or ; 2. Setting the `-l` argument when running in [Command Line](/CommandLine) mode. Labels can be added to existing workflows by using the `/labels` patch endpoint. After adding labels to your workflows, you can take advantage of the `/query` endpoint to filter tagged workflows. The Google backend supports labelling cloud resources and you can learn more about that [here](backends/Google#google-labels). #### Label Format. When labels are supplied to Cromwell, it will fail any request containing invalid label strings. Below are the requirements for a valid label key/value pair in Cromwell:. * Label keys may not be empty but label values may be empty.; * Label key and values have a max char limit of 255. For [default labels](backends/Google#google-labels) applied by the Google backend, Cromwell will modify workflow/task/call names to fit the schema, according to the following rules:. * Any capital letters are converted to lowercase.; * Any character which is not one of `[a-z]`, `[0-9]` or `-` will be replaced with `-`.; * If the start character does not match `[a-z]` then prefix with `x--`; * If the final character does not match `[a-z0-9]` then suffix with `--x`; * If the string is too long, only take the first 30 and last 30 characters and add `---` between them.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/Labels.md:1076,learn,learn,1076,docs/cromwell_features/Labels.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/Labels.md,1,['learn'],['learn']

You can explicitly specify the format by running cromwell with:. ```bash; java -DLOG_MODE=pretty -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. ### Log Level. By default, Cromwell outputs messages at a `LOG_LEVEL` of `INFO`. Sometimes, you may want more or less information logged. For example, while debugging an issue you may want to increase the amount information in the logs temporarily. Alternatively, the standard level may be too verbose, and you may only want Cromwell to log warnings and errors. You can set the level via the property `LOG_LEVEL` to any one of the values: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, or `OFF`. The default log level is `INFO`. ```bash; java -DLOG_LEVEL=DEBUG -jar cromwell.jar server; ```. ## Workflow Logs. While a workflow is running, Cromwell generates a log file specifically for the workflow. After the workflow completes, to clear up local disk space, Cromwell deletes the local copy of this log file. See the [Configuration](Configuring#workflow-log-directory) section on logs for more information on preventing cromwell from deleting each workflow log. Before Cromwell deletes the files and before the workflow completes, you can configure Cromwell to copy the workflow; logs to various locations. Normally, you'll want to copy the log to a remote bucket or directory. To specify the remote; directory to copy the logs to, use the separate [Workflow Option](wf_options/Overview#output-copying); `final_workflow_log_dir`. ## Call Logs. As each call in a workflow runs, it generates output to the standard output and standard error. This output is stored per call in call log files. Additionally, depending on the backend, specific per call backand logs may be generated. All of these call logs may be copied at the end of a workflow to a remote directory.

(See the [Google section](../backends/Google.md) for information about the `auth` field.). We can now run this workflow. ```wdl; version 1.0. workflow my_workflow {; String s = read_string(""gs://mybucket/my_file.txt""); output {; String out = s; }; }; ```. #### Default ""engine"" Filesystems. If you don't change anything in your own configuration file, the following default is inherited from `reference.conf`:; ```; engine {; filesystems {; local {; enabled: true; }; http {; enabled: true; }; }; }; ```. **Note**: since our configuration files are HOCON, to disable filesystems you *must* add `enabled: false` into your ; overriding configuration file. It is **not** sufficient to simply omit a filesystem from your stanza. . For example: adding this to your configuration file will remove the `http` filesystem and leave `local` for use in the ; engine:; ```; engine {; filesystems {; http {; enabled: false; }; }; }; ```. Whereas this example will leave `http` unchanged and merely re-assert the default enabling of `local`. In other; words, **this will do nothing**:; ```; engine {; filesystems {; local {; enabled: true; }; }; }; ```. ### Backend Filesystems. Similarly to the engine, you can also configure backend filesystems individually. Some backends might require the use of a specific filesystem.; For example, the [Pipelines API](../tutorials/PipelinesApi101.md) backend requires Google Cloud Storage.; Let's take another example:. ```wdl; version 1.0. task my_pipelines_task {; input {; File input_file; }; String content = read_string(input_file); ; command {; echo ~{content}; }; ; runtime {; docker: ""ubuntu""; }; }; workflow my_workflow {; call my_pipelines_task { input: ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/Filesystems.md:4518,simpl,simply,4518,docs/filesystems/Filesystems.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/Filesystems.md,1,['simpl'],['simply']

The default continues to be `390.46` which applies if and only if GPUs are being used.; * A default `gpuType` (""nvidia-tesla-k80"") will now be applied if `gpuCount` is specified but `gpuType` is not.; * Similarly, a default `gpuCount` (1) will be applied if `gpuType` is specified but `cpuCount` is not. ### Bug fixes. #### Better validation of workflow heartbeats. An error will be thrown on startup when the `system.workflow-heartbeats.heartbeat-interval` is not less than the; `system.workflow-heartbeats.ttl`. ## 40 Release Notes. ### Config Changes. #### Cromwell ID in instrumentation path. When set, the configuration value of `system.cromwell_id` will be prepended to StatsD metrics. More info [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developers/Instrumentation/). #### HealthMonitor Configuration. The HealthMonitor configuration has been refactored to provide a simpler interface:; * You no longer need to specify a monitor class in your `cromwell.conf` as this will now be inherited from the `reference.conf` value.; * You can now opt-in and opt-out of any combination of status monitors.; * The PAPI backends to monitor can now be listed in a single field. ##### Upgrading.

Usability,"ight be possible to use an alternative container engine, but this is not recommended if Docker is supported. #### Docker on HPC. Docker can allow running users to gain superuser privileges, called the [Docker daemon attack surface](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface). In HPC and multi-user environments, Docker recommends that ""only trusted users should be allowed to control your Docker Daemon"". For this reason, this tutorial will also explore other technologies that support the reproducibility and simplicity of running a workflow that use docker containers; Singularity and udocker. ___. ### Singularity. Singularity is a container technology designed for use on HPC systems in particular, while ensuring an appropriate level of security that Docker cannot provide. #### Installation; Before you can configure Cromwell on your HPC system, you will have to install Singularity, which is documented [here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/admin-guide/admin_quickstart.html#installation).; In order to gain access to the full set of features in Singularity, it is strongly recommended that Singularity is installed by root, with the `setuid` bit enabled, as is ([documented here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/2.6/admin-guide/security.html#how-does-singularity-do-it)).; This likely means that you will have to ask your sysadmin to install it for you.; Because `singularity` ideally needs `setuid`, your admins may have some qualms about giving Singularity this privilege.; If that is the case, you might consider forwarding [this letter](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html#singularity-on-a-shared-resource) to your admins. If you are not able to get Singularity installed with these privileges, you can attempt a user install.; If this is the case, you will have to alter your Cromwell configuration to work in ""sandbox"" mode, which is explained in [this part](#without-setuid) of the documentation. . #### Configuring Cromwell",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md:4531,guid,guide,4531,docs/tutorials/Containers.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/tutorials/Containers.md,2,['guid'],['guide']

When set to ""LOCAL"", the size of the drive is constrained to 375 GB intervals so intermediate values will be rounded up to the next 375 GB. All disks are set to auto-delete after the job completes. *Example 1: Changing the Localization Disk*. ```; runtime {; disks: ""local-disk 100 SSD""; }; ```. *Example 2: Mounting an Additional Two Disks*. ```; runtime {; disks: ""/mnt/my_mnt 3 SSD, /mnt/my_mnt2 500 HDD""; }; ```. ### `disk`. Specific to the TES backend, sets the `disk_gb` resource. ```; runtime {; disk: ""25 GB""; }; ```. ### `docker`. When specified, Cromwell will run your task within the specified Docker image. . ```; runtime {; docker: ""ubuntu:latest""; }; ```. - Local: Cromwell will automatically run the docker container.; - SFS: When a docker container exists within a task, the `submit-docker` method is called. See the [Getting started with containers](/tutorials/Containers/) guide for more information.; - GCP: This attribute is mandatory when submitting tasks to Google Cloud.; - AWS Batch: This attribute is mandatory when submitting tasks to AWS Batch. ### `maxRetries`. *Default: _0_*. This retry option is introduced to provide a method for tackling transient job failures. For example, if a task fails due to a timeout from accessing an external service, then this option helps re-run the failed the task without having to re-run the entire workflow. It takes an Int as a value that indicates the maximum number of times Cromwell should retry a failed task. This retry is applied towards jobs that fail while executing the task command. This method only applies to transient job failures and is a feeble attempt to retry a job, that is it cannot be used to increase memory in out-of-memory situations. If using the Google backend, it's important to note that The `maxRetries` count is independent from the [preemptible](#preemptible) count.

The default strategy `copy` is to copy the file to its new call location. As mentioned, `reference` will not copy the file and simply point the results to the existing location.; See the [Call Caching documentation](../cromwell_features/CallCaching.md) for more information. ## Requester Pays. GCS has a feature called Requester Pays (RP). This section describes how Cromwell supports it and the consequences on cost. Please first read the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/requester-pays) if you're not already familiar with it. The billing project Cromwell uses to access a bucket with requester pays is determined as follows:. - If a `google_project` was set in the [workflow options](../wf_options/Google.md) when the workflow was submitted, this value is used; - Otherwise, the value of the `project` field in the `gcs` filesystem configuration is used; - Otherwise, if the machine Cromwell runs on is authenticated using gcloud and a default project is set, this value will be used. **Important Note #1**: In order for a project to be billable to access a bucket with requester pays, the cr",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/GoogleCloudStorage.md:1454,simpl,simply,1454,docs/filesystems/GoogleCloudStorage.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/filesystems/GoogleCloudStorage.md,1,['simpl'],['simply']

More details [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/optimizations/CheckpointFiles). ## 54 Release Notes. ### Bug Fixes. * Fixed a bug that prevented `write_json()` from working with arrays and primitives. The function now works as expected for `Boolean`, `String`, `Integer`, `Float`,; `Pair[_, _]`, `Object`, `Map[_, _]` and `Array[_]` (including array of objects) type inputs. More information on WDL Type to JSON Type; conversion can be found [here](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/main/versions/1.0/SPEC.md#mixed-read_jsonstringfile). ### Spark backend support removal. Spark backend was not widely used and it was decided to remove it from the codebase in order to narrow the scope of Cromwell code. ### Improved DRS Localizer logging. Error logging while localizing a DRS URI should now be more clear especially when there is a Requester Pays bucket involved. ### Per-backend hog factors; Cromwell now allows overriding system-level log factors on back-end level. First, Cromwell will try to use hog-factor; defined in the backend config, and if it is not defined, it will default to using system-wide hog factor.; ```conf; backend {; providers {; PAPIv2 {; config {; hog-factor: 2; }; }; }; }; ```; For more information about hog factors please see [this page](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/cromwell_features/HogFactors/). ### `martha_v2` Support Removed. Cromwell now only supports resolving DOS or DRS URIs through [Martha](https://github.com/broadinstitute/martha)'s most; recent metadata endpoint `martha_v3`, dropping support for Martha's previous metadata endpoint `martha_v2`.

In this example the two directories `/mnt/one` and and `/mnt/two` will also be available within containers at their; original paths outside the container. So soft links pointing to paths under those directories will resolve during the; job execution. Note that if a user runs a workflow using an input file `/mnt/three/path/to/file` the job will fail; during execution as `/mnt/three` was not present inside the running container. ### Additional FileSystems. HPC backends (as well as the Local backend) can be configured to be able to interact with other type of filesystems, where the input files can be located for example.; Currently the only other filesystem supported is Google Cloud Storage (GCS). See the [Google section](Google) of the documentation for information on how to configure GCS in Cromwell.; Once you have a google authentication configured, you can simply add a `gcs` stanza in your configuration file to enable GCS:. ```; backend.providers.MyHPCBackend {; filesystems {; gcs {; # A reference to a potentially different auth for manipulating files via engine functions.; auth = ""application-default""; }; }; }; ```. ### Exit code timeout. If the cluster forcefully kills a job, it is unable to write its exit code anymore.; To address this the option `exit-code-timeout-seconds` can be used.; Cromwell will check the aliveness of the job with the `check-alive` script, every `exit-code-timeout-seconds` (polling).; When a job is no longer alive and another `exit-code-timeout-seconds` seconds have passed without an RC file being made, Cromwell can mark the job as failed.; If retries are enabled the job is submitted again.; This option will enable polling with the `check-alive` option, this could cause high load on whatever system `check-alive` calls.

Usability,"ly wind up; * An optional Docker image which if supplied will be the environment in which the command will be run; * A collection of arbitrary key/value pairs which can be used by the execution platform to tune the request, e.g. amount; of memory or the number of CPUs. The Docker image is not required for a backend but is highly recommended. The bioinformatics workflow field is rapidly; moving towards a Docker model so one will find better support for their backend if it is built around using Docker; containers. The input/output file mappings will depend on the needs of the platform. In the simplest example these values would be; identical, living on a shared filesystem. However an example of where this would be useful would be a model where an; input file lives in a cloud bucket and is directly copied onto the machine running the command line followed by copying; the program’s outputs back to a cloud bucket. The underlying platform can be extremely simple or have arbitrary levels of complexity as long as one can map from the; above concepts to running a command. That mapping could happen completely in the platform, the Cromwell backend, or a; mixture of the two. The implementer of a backend will need to strike the balance which works best for both their needs; and the particulars of the platform itself. Throughout the rest of this document the following terms are used, the difference between them may be subtle but; important:. * Workflow: a container of one or more calls, possibly expressing execution dependencies on each other. May contain; scatters, conditional logic, or subworkflow invocations.; * Task: The abstract definition of a thing to run. Think of this like a function in a programming language.; * Call: An instantiated request in Cromwell of a thing to run. To further the function analogy this would be an; invocation of that function.; * Job: The physical manifestation of a call by the backend.

However, if you are sharing your Docker images with other users or have limited space in your user directory, you can redirect this caching location by exporting the `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` variable in your `.bashrc` or at the start of the `submit-docker` block.; ```; export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/path/to/shared/cache; ```. For further information on the Singularity Cache, refer to the [Singularity 2 caching documentation](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/2.6/user-guide/build_environment.html#cache-folders) (this hasn't yet been updated for Singularity 3). ___. ### udocker. [udocker](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker) is a tool designed to ""execute simple docker containers in user space without requiring root privileges"". In essence, udocker provides a command line interface that mimics `docker`, and implements the commands using one of four different container backends:. * PRoot; * Fakechroot; * runC; * Singularity. #### Installation; udocker can be installed without any kind of root permissions. Refer to udocker's installation documentation [here](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/blob/master/doc/installation_manual.md) for more information. #### Configuration. (As of [2019-02-18](https://github.com/indigo-dc/udocker/issues/112)) udocker does not support looking up docker container by digests, hence you'll have to make ensure `hash-lookup` is disabled.

Additionally, you can override system-level hog-factor on a backend level, by setting it in the particular backend configuration like this:; ```conf; backend {; providers {; PAPIv2 {; config {; hog-factor: 2; }; }; }; }; ```. ### Setting a hog-factor. The hog factor option sets the integer described in the [Hog Factor](#hog-factor) section above.; The default value is `1` (which is equivalent to not limiting by hog group). . ### Assignment of hog groups. Within the configuration file, you can specify the workflow option that will determine the hog group. The default is; `hogGroup`. So if a workflow arrives with the following workflow options file, Cromwell will assign `hogGroupA` as the ; workflow's hog group:. ```json; {; ""hogGroup"": ""hogGroupA""; }; ```. - Any workflow option value can be used so long as it is a simple `String` value:; + You can come up with a new field and set it specifically for assigning hog groups.; + You can choose a field that is already being used for other reasons; - If a workflow is submitted without a value for the designated field in its workflow options, the workflow ID is used ; as the hog group identifier. . ### Logging. Because the system is not a simple first-in-first-out, it can be valuable to see the status of all ; the existing queues inside Cromwell. . To have this information logged on a regular basis, you can enable periodic queue logging. This will; also alert you at the same frequency when events are happening, such as hog groups being at their individual limits. * You can enable logging for the Job Execution Token Dispenser, using; the `system.hog-safety.token-log-interval-seconds` configuration value.; * The default, `0`, means that no logging will occur. ## Effects. ### Job Execution. #### Reserving Space. - Cromwell allows administrators to designate an overall maximum con",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md:3663,simpl,simple,3663,docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/cromwell_features/HogFactors.md,1,['simpl'],['simple']

Usability,"nd of this tutorial you'll have configured your local environment to run workflows using Cromwell on AWS Batch. ### Let's get started!. To create all the resources for running a Cromwell server on AWS using CloudFormation, launch the [Cromwell Full Stack Deployment](https://docs.opendata.aws/genomics-workflows/orchestration/cromwell/cromwell-overview/). Alternatively, this page will walk through the specific steps to configure and run a local Cromwell server using AWS Batch. 1. [Authenticating a local Cromwell server with AWS](#authenticating-a-local-cromwell-server-with-aws); 2. [Configuring the AWS environment](#configuring-the-aws-environment); 3. [Configuring Cromwell](#configuring-cromwell); 4. [Workflow Source Files](#workflow-source-files); 5. [Running Cromwell and AWS](#running-cromwell-and-aws); 6. [Outputs](#outputs). #### Authenticating a local Cromwell server with AWS. The easiest way to allow a local Cromwell server to talk to AWS is to:. 1. Install the AWS CLI through Amazon's [user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html).; 2. [Configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) by calling `aws configure` (provide your `Access Key` and `Secret Access Key` when prompted). Cromwell can access these credentials through the default authentication provider. For more options, see the [Configuring authentication of Cromwell with AWS](/backends/AWSBatch#configuring-authentication) section below. #### Configuring the AWS environment. Next you'll need the following setup in your AWS account:; - The core set of resources (S3 Bucket, IAM Roles, AWS Batch); - Custom Compute Resource (Launch Template or AMI) with Cromwell Additions.

In some cases PAPI v2 will report the preemption of a VM in a way that differs from PAPI v1. This novel means of reporting; preemption was not recognized by Cromwell's PAPI v2 backend and would result in preemptions being miscategorized as call failures.; Cromwell's PAPI v2 backend will now handle this type of preemption. ## 43 Release Notes. ### Virtual Private Cloud with Subnetworks. Cromwell now allows PAPIV2 jobs to run on a specific subnetwork inside a private network by adding the subnetwork key; `subnetwork-label-key` inside `virtual-private-cloud` in backend configuration. More info [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/Google/). ### Call caching database refactoring. Cromwell's `CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY` primary key has been refactored to use a `BIGINT` datatype in place of the previous; `INT` datatype. Cromwell will not be usable during the time the Liquibase migration for this refactor is running.; In the Google Cloud SQL with SSD environment this migration runs at a rate of approximately 100,000 `CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY`; rows per second. In deployments with millions or billions of `CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY` rows the migration may require; a significant amount of downtime so please plan accordingly. The following SQL could be used to estimate the number of; rows in this table:. ```; select max(CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY_ID) from CALL_CACHING_HASH_ENTRY; ```. ### Stackdriver Instrumentation.

Usability,"ngularity and udocker. ___. ### Singularity. Singularity is a container technology designed for use on HPC systems in particular, while ensuring an appropriate level of security that Docker cannot provide. #### Installation; Before you can configure Cromwell on your HPC system, you will have to install Singularity, which is documented [here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/admin-guide/admin_quickstart.html#installation).; In order to gain access to the full set of features in Singularity, it is strongly recommended that Singularity is installed by root, with the `setuid` bit enabled, as is ([documented here](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/2.6/admin-guide/security.html#how-does-singularity-do-it)).; This likely means that you will have to ask your sysadmin to install it for you.; Because `singularity` ideally needs `setuid`, your admins may have some qualms about giving Singularity this privilege.; If that is the case, you might consider forwarding [this letter](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html#singularity-on-a-shared-resource) to your admins. If you are not able to get Singularity installed with these privileges, you can attempt a user install.; If this is the case, you will have to alter your Cromwell configuration to work in ""sandbox"" mode, which is explained in [this part](#without-setuid) of the documentation. . #### Configuring Cromwell for Singularity. Once Singularity is installed, you'll need to modify the `config` block inside `backend.providers` in your Cromwell configuration. In particular, this block contains a key called `submit-docker`, which will contain a script that is run whenever a job needs to run that uses a Docker image. If the job does not specify a Docker image, the regular `submit` block will be used. As the configuration will require more knowledge about your execution environment, see the local and job scheduler sections below for example configurations. ##### Local environments.

Usability,"o/my/htpasswdfile; Require user someone someoneelse; ProxyPass http://101.101.234.567:8000 # address of cromwell server web service; </Location>; ```. Users now hit `http://my.proxy.org/cromwell` with authenticated requests, and they're forwarded to port 8000 on the Cromwell server host. . **Multiple Servers on one Host**. The above scheme extends easily to multiple Cromwell instances, for use by different groups within an organization, for example. If multiple instances are running on the same host, then each instance should be run as its own dedicated user (such as service account when using a [Google Cloud backend](backends/Google)), e.g. `cromwell1`, `cromwell2` etc so that processes running under one Cromwell instance cannot access the files of another. Different webservice ports must also be configured separately in order to not clash. If persistent database storage is being used, then each instance must be configured with its own database. The proxy configuration above is extended simply by adding another `Location`:. ```Apache; <Location /cromwell1>; Order deny,allow; Allow from all; AuthType Basic; AuthName ""Password Required""; AuthUserFile /path/to/my/htpasswdfile1; Require user stillanotherperson andanother; ProxyPass http://101.101.234.567:8001; </Location>; ```. **Multiple Tenants in one Cromwell Server**. Even with a proxy in place, a single Cromwell server does not provide _authorization_ for individual users hitting the endpoints. This allows, for instance, one _authenticated_ user to view the metadata for a workflow run by another _authenticated_ user. Due to this limitation, it is important that all users of this Cromwell server be trusted. . With the exception of the use of the `google_compute_service_account` scheme in the [Configuration](Configuring#authentication) for the [Google Cloud backend](backends/Google)), Cromwell servers are setup to access files for use in workflows using a single set of credentials. This means that all users of these",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/Security.md:2683,simpl,simply,2683,docs/developers/Security.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/docs/developers/Security.md,1,['simpl'],['simply']

Now we can download Cromwell from git repository. ##### a. Create a directory into which we will install Cromwell. ```hocon; mkdir cromwell; ```. ##### b. Now, we set the owner of that directory to the cromwell user and group and change the permissions in order to allow access to all users. ```hocon; chmod 775 -R cromwell; chown -R cromwell:cromwell cromwell; ```. ##### c. Login to the cromwell user account. ```hocon; su - cromwell; ```. ##### d. We will now use git to clone the Cromwell git repository. ```hocon; cd cromwell; git clone https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell.git; ```. ##### e. This guide was tested and validated with `version 52` of cromwell, so we will checkout that version. ```hocon; cd cromwell; git checkout 52; ```. ### 3.

Provided all of the files are within the same directory, we can run our workflow with the following command:. > **Note**: You might have a different Cromwell version number here. ```bash; java -Dconfig.file=aws.conf -jar cromwell-36.jar run hello.wdl; ```. This will:; 1. Start Cromwell in `run` mode,; 2. Prepare `hello.wdl` as a job and submit this to your AWS Batch queue. You can monitor the job within your [AWS Batch dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/batch/home).; 3. Run the job, write execution files back to S3, and report progress back to Cromwell. #### Outputs.

First off, here are useful links:. * Cromwell documentation: [cromwell.readthedocs.io](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io); * Source on Github: [github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/develop/docs); * Builds on ReadTheDocs: [readthedocs.org/projects/cromwell](https://readthedocs.org/projects/cromwell/builds/); * How to build and view the documentation locally: [mkdocs.readthedocs.io](https://mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#installation). ### Writing Tips. 1. Keep it clear, accurate, and concise.; 2. Put the most important information first.; 3. Use the second person, use “you” instead of “the user”.; 4. No passive verbs (everything is done by something).; 5. Link to the original source, don't repeat documentation. . ### Formatting. The documentation is written in Markdown.

For example, in a terminal:; ```sh; cd ~; mkdir cromwell; cp ~/Downloads/cromwell-XY.jar cromwell/; cd cromwell/; ```; _(if you're not using a Mac, the final command might be different for you)_. ### Step 2: Writing your first workflow description. This bit is easy, you're just going to copy and paste something from the internet. Open your favorite editor. Paste in the following content and save it as `myWorkflow.wdl` in your new `cromwell` directory:. ```wdl; # Example workflow; # Declare WDL version 1.0 if working in Terra; version 1.0; workflow myWorkflow {; 	call myTask; }. task myTask {; 	command <<<; 		echo ""hello world""; 	>>>; 	output {; 		String out = read_string(stdout()); 	}; }; ```. Don't worry, **you don't need to understand too much about the workflow contents to continue for now**. In brief, it tells Cromwell to run a task to run `echo ""hello world""`, and then return the output as a String. If you'd like to learn more about how to author WDL, you can find all the WDL resources you could ever want [here](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl). ### Step 3: Running the workflow. Ok, we have Cromwell, we have a workflow, let's put it all together! . Make sure you're in the cromwell directory with the `.jar` file and the `.wdl` file. Now type in:; ```sh; java -jar cromwell-XY.jar run myWorkflow.wdl; ```. Cromwell will print out a fair old chunk of logging information, which can be configured (once you've completed this tutorial and [Configuration Files](ConfigurationFiles), you might want to investigate the [Logging](../Logging) page). Ultimately, the workflow should succeed and you'll end up with the following output printed out when Cromwell finishes:; ```json; {; 	""myWorkflow.myTask.out"": ""hello world""; }; ```.

Usability,"ted the platform the thinner the shim needs to be and vice; versa. A job from Cromwell’s perspective is a collection of the following information:. * A unix command line to run; * A mapping of where its input files currently live to where the command line expects them to be; * A mapping of where the command line will write its outputs to where they should eventually wind up; * An optional Docker image which if supplied will be the environment in which the command will be run; * A collection of arbitrary key/value pairs which can be used by the execution platform to tune the request, e.g. amount; of memory or the number of CPUs. The Docker image is not required for a backend but is highly recommended. The bioinformatics workflow field is rapidly; moving towards a Docker model so one will find better support for their backend if it is built around using Docker; containers. The input/output file mappings will depend on the needs of the platform. In the simplest example these values would be; identical, living on a shared filesystem. However an example of where this would be useful would be a model where an; input file lives in a cloud bucket and is directly copied onto the machine running the command line followed by copying; the program’s outputs back to a cloud bucket. The underlying platform can be extremely simple or have arbitrary levels of complexity as long as one can map from the; above concepts to running a command. That mapping could happen completely in the platform, the Cromwell backend, or a; mixture of the two. The implementer of a backend will need to strike the balance which works best for both their needs; and the particulars of the platform itself.

Usability,"they are complete. When no new jobs can start and all jobs have finished (Success, Failure, Aborted), the workflow terminates. In an ideal situation, all jobs succeed and the workflow succeeds.; Unfortunately things don't always go as planned. Here is what to expect from Cromwell when things go off the rails. ## Failure Modes. Cromwell supports two failure modes, which specify how Cromwell behaves when a job fails during the execution of a workflow. * `NoNewCalls` **(default)** ; 	* Cromwell does not start any new call as soon as a job fails. Cromwell will still monitor the rest of the jobs until they complete (successfully or not). ; * `ContinueWhilePossible` ; 	* Cromwell attempts to run as many jobs as possible until no more can be started. When all running jobs are complete, the workflow fails. The failure mode can be set in the [Configuration](../Configuring/) or [Workflow Options](../wf_options/Overview#workflow-failure). _For example:_. ![](ABdependency.png). This simple diagram represents 4 jobs:. * Job A and Job B are independent; ; * Job A1 depends on A; ; * Job B1 depends on B. Let's look at the case where A and B are both running, and for some reason B fails (shaded red). **`NoNewCalls`** ; If the failure mode is `NoNewCalls` Cromwell waits for A to complete (shaded green). Regardless of whether A is successful or not, Cromwell then fails the workflow, without starting A1 or B1 (shaded grey). ![](NNC_B_fail.png). **`ContinueWhilePossible`** ; If the failure mode is `ContinueWhilePossible` and A succeeds (green), then Cromwell starts A1 (green) and waits for it to complete. At this point all jobs that can run have completed. B1 (grey) cannot run since B failed (red), therefore Cromwell fails the workflow without starting B1. ![](CWP_B_fail.png). ### Retryable failures. Retryable failures are **not** failures that can trigger a workflow failure. An example of a retryable failure is when a [preemptible VM](../RuntimeAttributes/#preemptible) is preempted. .

The [`jes-cromwell` directory](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/develop/scripts/docker-compose-mysql/jes-cromwell) is an example of how to customize the original compose file with a configuration file and environment variables. It uses the application default credentials of the host machine. To use it make sure your gcloud is up to date and that your [application-default credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials) are set up. Then run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f jes-cromwell/docker-compose.yml up` to start a Cromwell server with a Google Cloud backend on MySQL. **MySQL**. The data directory in the MySQL container is [mounted to `compose/mysql/data`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/develop/scripts/docker-compose-mysql/compose/mysql/init), which allows the data to survive a `docker-compose down`. To disable this feature, simply remove the `./compose/mysql/data:/var/lib/mysql` line in the [volume section of `docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/scripts/docker-compose-mysql/docker-compose.yml). Note that in such case, the data will still be preserved by a `docker-compose stop` that stops the container but doesn't delete it. **Notes**. To run Cromwell in the background, add `-d` at the end of the command:; `docker-compose up -d`. To then see the logs for a specific service, run `docker-compose logs -f <service>`. ; For example `docker-compose logs -f cromwell`.

All call caching keys are now in a `callCaching` stanza. `Call cache read result` has moved here and is now `result`. The `allowResultReuse` and `effectiveCallCachingMode` have moved here. The `hit` boolean is a simple indication of whether or not it was a hit, with no additional information. An example using the new format is:; ```; ""callCaching"": {; ""hit"": false,; ""effectiveCallCachingMode"": ""ReadAndWriteCache"",; ""result"": ""Cache Miss"",; ""allowResultReuse"": true; }; ```. ### Config Changes. * Added a field `insert-batch-size` to the `database` stanza which defines how many values from a batch insert will be processed at a time. This value defaults to 2000.; * Moved the config value `services.MetadataService.metadata-summary-refresh-interval` to `services.MetadataService.config.metadata-summary-refresh-interval`; * Added ability to override the default zone(s) used by JES via the config structure by setting `genomics.default-zones` in the JES configuration; * The cromwell server TCP binding timeout is now configurable via the config key `webservice.binding-timeout`, defaulted; to the previous value `5s` (five seconds) via the reference.conf.; * For MySQL users, a massive scalability improvement via batched DB writing of ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:95214,simpl,simple,95214,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['simpl'],['simple']
Usability,"usly updated a value from `""value-1""` > `""value-2""` >; `""value-3""` > `""value-2""` then the former REST API will return `value-3` while the latter will return `value-2`. #### Workflow options `google_project` output in metadata. Workflow metadata for jobs run on a Google Pipelines API backend will report the `google_project` specified via a; [workflow options json](http://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/wf_options/Google/#google-pipelines-api-workflow-options). ## 31 Release Notes. * **Cromwell server**; The Cromwell server source code is now located under `server/src`. `sbt assembly` will build the runnable Cromwell JAR in; `server/target/scala-2.12/` with a name like `cromwell-<VERSION>.jar`. * **Robustness**; + The rate at which jobs are being started can now be controlled using the `system.job-rate-control` configuration stanza.; + A load controller service has been added to allow Cromwell to self-monitor and adjust its load accordingly.; The load controller is currently a simple on/off switch controlling the job start rate. It gathers metrics from different parts of the system; to inform its decision to stop the creation of jobs.; You can find relevant configuration in the `services.LoadController` section of the `cromwell.examples.conf` file,; as well as in the `load-control` section in `reference.conf`.; The load level of the monitored sub-systems are instrumented and can be found under the `cromwell.load` statsD path.; + The statsD metrics have been re-shuffled a bit. If you had a dashboard you might find that you need to update it.; Changes include:; + Removed artificially inserted ""count"" and ""timing"" the path; + Added a `load` section; + Metrics were prefixed twice with `cromwell` (`cromwell.cromwell.my_metric`), now they're only prefixed once; + Added `processed` and `queue` metrics under various metrics monitoring the throughput and amount of queued work respectively; + Added a memory metric representing an estimation of the free memory Cromwell thinks ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:77177,simpl,simple,77177,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['simpl'],['simple']
Usability,"well's requests to PAPIv2 can now be configured. See the sample PAPIv2.conf for more documentation:. ```conf; backend {; providers {; PAPIv2 {; config {; batch-requests {; timeouts {; read = 10 seconds; connect = 10 seconds; }; }; }; }; }; }; ```. ### Virtual Private Networks. Cromwell now allows PAPIV2 jobs to run on a private network by adding the network name inside `virtual-private-cloud` in backend configuration.; More info [here](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/backends/Google/). ### AWS Backend. Now includes background job status polling to hopefully reduce the incidence of 'HTTP 429' errors for large workflows. ## 41 Release Notes. ### Workflow Options. * It is now possible to supply custom `google-labels` in [workflow options](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/wf_options/Google/). ### AWS backend. It is now possible to use WDL disk attributes with the following formats on AWS.; ```; disks: ""local-disk 20 SSD""; ```; ```; disks: ""/some/mnt 20 SSD""; ```; Because Cromwell's AWS backend auto-sizes disks, the size specification is simply discarded. ### Time Formatting. In previous versions of Cromwell, times were converted to strings using; [the default Java formatter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/OffsetDateTime.html#toString--) which; generates a variety of ISO-8601 formats. String conversions also retained whatever server time zone generated that; specific time instance. Going forward, times stored in Cromwell metadata, and later returned via the HTTP endpoint, are now converted to UTC; then formatted with exactly three digits of milliseconds. For example:; - `2017-01-19T12:34:56-04:00` will now be formatted as; - `2017-01-19T16:34:56.000Z`. This change only affects newly formatted dates. Older dates already formatted and stored by previous versions of; Cromwell will not be updated however they will still return a; [valid ISO-8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). The older format may be in various non-UTC ",MatchSource.DOCS,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md:51002,simpl,simply,51002,CHANGELOG.md,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/87/CHANGELOG.md,1,['simpl'],['simply']
Usability,"you need to specify the type of disk and size. In AWS, this will; be defined instead when you setup your environment (more on that later), so; all the AWS backend really needs to know is what mount points you need; defined. This infrastructure and all the associated configuration still exists; however,; it is moved out of the Cromwell configuration. AWS Batch; ---------. Because AWS Batch is so different from PAPI, those familiar only with PAPI; would be best off with an overview of AWS Batch. If you are familiar with; the workings of Batch, feel free to skip this section, and move on. [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) fundamentally is a service to allow batch jobs to run easily and; efficiently. To use it effectively, however, you need to understand its own; technical stack. To create a job, you need a ""Job Queue"". That job queue allows; jobs to be scheduled onto one or more ""Compute Environments"". This can; be managed through AWS Batch, but when AWS Batch sets up a compute environment,; it's simply setting up an Elastic Container Service (ECS) Cluster. The ECS; cluster, in turn is just a few managed CloudFormation templates, that is; controlling an AutoScaling group of EC2 instances. What really makes an ECS instance an ECS instance is the presence of a configured; [Amazon ECS agent](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent). This agent polls; the ECS service to determine if there are any tasks to run. An AWS Batch Job; will be turned into an ECS task. From there, the agent will pick it up and; manage it, sending updates back to ECS (and from there AWS Batch) on a regular; basis. There are some limits that will impact the design of the AWS Batch backend, and; will be discussed later. These are:. * [AWS Batch Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/service_limits.html); * [8k container overrides limit.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/run-task.html).
