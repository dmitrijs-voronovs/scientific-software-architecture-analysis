Availability,"## Oceananigans v0.27.0. [Diff since v0.26.0](https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/compare/v0.26.0...v0.27.0). Breaking changes:. - in `FieldBoundaryConditions(grid, location)`, the argument `location` is now be a 3-tuple of _uninstantiated_ types, eg: `(Face, Cell, Cell)` for a field at the location of the `u`-velocity field. Previously, `location` was a 3-tuple of instantiated types. Release notes:. - `has_velocities` was fixed so that `show` works for models with no tracers; - `BoundaryFunction` can now have parameters: use `BoundaryFunction(func, parameters)` if `func(ξ, ζ, t, parameters)` takes a final argument `parameters`. (`parameters=nothing` by default.); - four new wrapper functions were defined for specifying 'simple' boundary condition functions: ; 1. `TracerBoundaryCondition`; 2. `UVelocityBoundaryCondition`; 3. `VVelocityBoundaryCondition`; 4. `WVelocityBoundaryCondition`; - All four functions take three (optionally four) arguments: `(bctype, boundary, func, [parameters=nothing])`, where `bctype` is `Value`, `Gradient`, or `Flux` and boundary is `:x`, `:y`, or `:z`. If `parameters=nothing`, `func(ξ, ζ, t)` is a function of the on-boundary coordinates `(ξ, ζ)` and time `t`. If `parameters` is set, it is passed to `func(ξ, ζ, t, parameters)`. **Closed issues:**; - API divergence for abstract operations versus boundary conditions (#659); - ""show"" method throws an error for models with no tracers (#700). **Merged pull requests:**; - Consistent API for field locations (#698) (@glwagner); - More convenient BoundaryFunction functionality (#699) (@glwagner); - Fix has_velocities (#701) (@glwagner)",MatchSource.RELEASES,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/releases/tag/v0.27.0:1412,error,error,1412,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/releases/tag/v0.27.0,1,['error'],['error']

Integrability,"## Oceananigans v0.27.0. [Diff since v0.26.0](https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/compare/v0.26.0...v0.27.0). Breaking changes:. - in `FieldBoundaryConditions(grid, location)`, the argument `location` is now be a 3-tuple of _uninstantiated_ types, eg: `(Face, Cell, Cell)` for a field at the location of the `u`-velocity field. Previously, `location` was a 3-tuple of instantiated types. Release notes:. - `has_velocities` was fixed so that `show` works for models with no tracers; - `BoundaryFunction` can now have parameters: use `BoundaryFunction(func, parameters)` if `func(ξ, ζ, t, parameters)` takes a final argument `parameters`. (`parameters=nothing` by default.); - four new wrapper functions were defined for specifying 'simple' boundary condition functions: ; 1. `TracerBoundaryCondition`; 2. `UVelocityBoundaryCondition`; 3. `VVelocityBoundaryCondition`; 4. `WVelocityBoundaryCondition`; - All four functions take three (optionally four) arguments: `(bctype, boundary, func, [parameters=nothing])`, where `bctype` is `Value`, `Gradient`, or `Flux` and boundary is `:x`, `:y`, or `:z`. If `parameters=nothing`, `func(ξ, ζ, t)` is a function of the on-boundary coordinates `(ξ, ζ)` and time `t`. If `parameters` is set, it is passed to `func(ξ, ζ, t, parameters)`. **Closed issues:**; - API divergence for abstract operations versus boundary conditions (#659); - ""show"" method throws an error for models with no tracers (#700). **Merged pull requests:**; - Consistent API for field locations (#698) (@glwagner); - More convenient BoundaryFunction functionality (#699) (@glwagner); - Fix has_velocities (#701) (@glwagner)",MatchSource.RELEASES,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/releases/tag/v0.27.0:699,wrap,wrapper,699,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/releases/tag/v0.27.0,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']
Integrability,"## Oceananigans v0.43.0. [Diff since v0.42.0](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/compare/v0.42.0...v0.43.0). Release notes:. * Fixes a bug in `TwoDimensionalLeith` (PR #1073, issue #1034). Previously tests were being skipped due to extreme slowness. Now we run tests on GPU (but not CPU, where the closure is much slower to compile). * Rewrites the interface for ""scheduling"" output and diagnostics (PR #1070). Previously output and diagnostics were usually scheduled by specifying either `time_interval` or `iteration_interval` kwargs in the constrcutor for the object in question. Now, the relevant kwarg is called `schedule` and takes a callable `AbstractSchedule` object (or any user-defined function `func` that returns `true` or `false` depending on the single argument `func(model)`). This design is more flexible and extensible, and also simplifies underlying code. Four schedules are provided:. - `TimeInterval(interval)`; - `IterationInterval(interval)`; - `WallTimeInterval(interval)`; - `AveragedTimeInterval(interval; window=interval, stride=1)` (for time-averaging output). Breaking changes:. * Output writers and diagnostics no longer have the keyword arguments `time_interval` or `iteration_interval`. The most commonly-used features that are affected are `JLD2OutputWriter`, `NetCDFOutputWriter`, and `Checkpointer`. `JLD2OutputWriter` and `NetCDFOutputWriter` no longer have the kwargs `time_averaging_window` and `time_averaging_stride`. The specific syntax changes are:. * `time_interval=T` becomes `schedule=TimeInterval(T)`; * `iteration_interval=I` becomes `schedule=IterationInterval(I)`; * `time_interval=T, time_averaging_window=W` becomes `schedule=AveragedTimeInterval(T, window=W)`. **Closed issues:**; - Should we change 'OutputWriters' to 'Output'?

Modifiability,"## Oceananigans v0.43.0. [Diff since v0.42.0](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/compare/v0.42.0...v0.43.0). Release notes:. * Fixes a bug in `TwoDimensionalLeith` (PR #1073, issue #1034). Previously tests were being skipped due to extreme slowness. Now we run tests on GPU (but not CPU, where the closure is much slower to compile). * Rewrites the interface for ""scheduling"" output and diagnostics (PR #1070). Previously output and diagnostics were usually scheduled by specifying either `time_interval` or `iteration_interval` kwargs in the constrcutor for the object in question. Now, the relevant kwarg is called `schedule` and takes a callable `AbstractSchedule` object (or any user-defined function `func` that returns `true` or `false` depending on the single argument `func(model)`). This design is more flexible and extensible, and also simplifies underlying code. Four schedules are provided:. - `TimeInterval(interval)`; - `IterationInterval(interval)`; - `WallTimeInterval(interval)`; - `AveragedTimeInterval(interval; window=interval, stride=1)` (for time-averaging output). Breaking changes:. * Output writers and diagnostics no longer have the keyword arguments `time_interval` or `iteration_interval`. The most commonly-used features that are affected are `JLD2OutputWriter`, `NetCDFOutputWriter`, and `Checkpointer`. `JLD2OutputWriter` and `NetCDFOutputWriter` no longer have the kwargs `time_averaging_window` and `time_averaging_stride`. The specific syntax changes are:. * `time_interval=T` becomes `schedule=TimeInterval(T)`; * `iteration_interval=I` becomes `schedule=IterationInterval(I)`; * `time_interval=T, time_averaging_window=W` becomes `schedule=AveragedTimeInterval(T, window=W)`. **Closed issues:**; - Should we change 'OutputWriters' to 'Output'?

Testability,"## Oceananigans v0.43.0. [Diff since v0.42.0](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/compare/v0.42.0...v0.43.0). Release notes:. * Fixes a bug in `TwoDimensionalLeith` (PR #1073, issue #1034). Previously tests were being skipped due to extreme slowness. Now we run tests on GPU (but not CPU, where the closure is much slower to compile). * Rewrites the interface for ""scheduling"" output and diagnostics (PR #1070). Previously output and diagnostics were usually scheduled by specifying either `time_interval` or `iteration_interval` kwargs in the constrcutor for the object in question. Now, the relevant kwarg is called `schedule` and takes a callable `AbstractSchedule` object (or any user-defined function `func` that returns `true` or `false` depending on the single argument `func(model)`). This design is more flexible and extensible, and also simplifies underlying code. Four schedules are provided:. - `TimeInterval(interval)`; - `IterationInterval(interval)`; - `WallTimeInterval(interval)`; - `AveragedTimeInterval(interval; window=interval, stride=1)` (for time-averaging output). Breaking changes:. * Output writers and diagnostics no longer have the keyword arguments `time_interval` or `iteration_interval`.

Some breaking changes:; * Function signatures for boundary condition functions and forcing functions have been simplified.; * The `model.parameters` field has been nuked in favor of more local ""parameters"" functionality. `ParameterizedForcing` and `ParameterizedBoundaryCondition` convenience types and functions have been added. The new forcing function signature is; ```julia; F(i, j, k, grid, clock, state); ```; while the new boundary condition function signature is; ```julia; bc(i, j, grid, clock, state); ```; where `i, j` are indices along the boundary. `state` is a `NamedTuple` with fields `velocities`, `tracers`, and `diffusivities`, each corresponding to an `OffsetArray` that references the data associated with each field. **Closed issues:**; - Stabilizing forcing function arguments and boundary condition function arguments (#682). **Merged pull requests:**; - CompatHelper: bump compat for ""CUDAdrv"" to ""6.0"" (#688) (@github-actions[bot]); - CompatHelper: bump compat for ""CUDAapi"" to ""4.0"" (#689) (@github-actions[bot]); - Fix typo in application of y value BCs (#690) (@ali-ramadhan); - Fix `cell_diffusion_timescale` with zero tracers (#691) (@ali-ramadhan); - Simpler boundary condition functions and forcing functions (#697) (@glwagner)",MatchSource.RELEASES,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/releases/tag/v0.26.0:236,simpl,simplified,236,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/releases/tag/v0.26.0,1,['simpl'],['simplified']
Usability,"## Oceananigans v0.27.0. [Diff since v0.26.0](https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/compare/v0.26.0...v0.27.0). Breaking changes:. - in `FieldBoundaryConditions(grid, location)`, the argument `location` is now be a 3-tuple of _uninstantiated_ types, eg: `(Face, Cell, Cell)` for a field at the location of the `u`-velocity field. Previously, `location` was a 3-tuple of instantiated types. Release notes:. - `has_velocities` was fixed so that `show` works for models with no tracers; - `BoundaryFunction` can now have parameters: use `BoundaryFunction(func, parameters)` if `func(ξ, ζ, t, parameters)` takes a final argument `parameters`. (`parameters=nothing` by default.); - four new wrapper functions were defined for specifying 'simple' boundary condition functions: ; 1. `TracerBoundaryCondition`; 2. `UVelocityBoundaryCondition`; 3. `VVelocityBoundaryCondition`; 4. `WVelocityBoundaryCondition`; - All four functions take three (optionally four) arguments: `(bctype, boundary, func, [parameters=nothing])`, where `bctype` is `Value`, `Gradient`, or `Flux` and boundary is `:x`, `:y`, or `:z`. If `parameters=nothing`, `func(ξ, ζ, t)` is a function of the on-boundary coordinates `(ξ, ζ)` and time `t`. If `parameters` is set, it is passed to `func(ξ, ζ, t, parameters)`. **Closed issues:**; - API divergence for abstract operations versus boundary conditions (#659); - ""show"" method throws an error for models with no tracers (#700). **Merged pull requests:**; - Consistent API for field locations (#698) (@glwagner); - More convenient BoundaryFunction functionality (#699) (@glwagner); - Fix has_velocities (#701) (@glwagner)",MatchSource.RELEASES,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/releases/tag/v0.27.0:746,simpl,simple,746,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/releases/tag/v0.27.0,1,['simpl'],['simple']
Usability,"## Oceananigans v0.43.0. [Diff since v0.42.0](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/compare/v0.42.0...v0.43.0). Release notes:. * Fixes a bug in `TwoDimensionalLeith` (PR #1073, issue #1034). Previously tests were being skipped due to extreme slowness. Now we run tests on GPU (but not CPU, where the closure is much slower to compile). * Rewrites the interface for ""scheduling"" output and diagnostics (PR #1070). Previously output and diagnostics were usually scheduled by specifying either `time_interval` or `iteration_interval` kwargs in the constrcutor for the object in question. Now, the relevant kwarg is called `schedule` and takes a callable `AbstractSchedule` object (or any user-defined function `func` that returns `true` or `false` depending on the single argument `func(model)`). This design is more flexible and extensible, and also simplifies underlying code. Four schedules are provided:. - `TimeInterval(interval)`; - `IterationInterval(interval)`; - `WallTimeInterval(interval)`; - `AveragedTimeInterval(interval; window=interval, stride=1)` (for time-averaging output). Breaking changes:. * Output writers and diagnostics no longer have the keyword arguments `time_interval` or `iteration_interval`. The most commonly-used features that are affected are `JLD2OutputWriter`, `NetCDFOutputWriter`, and `Checkpointer`. `JLD2OutputWriter` and `NetCDFOutputWriter` no longer have the kwargs `time_averaging_window` and `time_averaging_stride`. The specific syntax changes are:. * `time_interval=T` becomes `schedule=TimeInterval(T)`; * `iteration_interval=I` becomes `schedule=IterationInterval(I)`; * `time_interval=T, time_averaging_window=W` becomes `schedule=AveragedTimeInterval(T, window=W)`. **Closed issues:**; - Should we change 'OutputWriters' to 'Output'? (#706); - Possible elegant solution for compiling kernels with fields as arguments (#722); - Different output intervals for different field outputs using JLD2OuputWriter (#826); - More general criteria for writing d",MatchSource.RELEASES,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/releases/tag/v0.43.0:852,simpl,simplifies,852,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/releases/tag/v0.43.0,1,['simpl'],['simplifies']
