Since just like the problem with 1) above there seems to be switch of the column 12 to 10 and you are observing weird looking file. . In short: Everything is fine till column 9th but there is a bug which makes column 12 to 10, 10 to 11 and 11 to 12. If you provide `--dumpUmiGraph` then last two columns represents `mRnaFraction	rRnaFraction` while everything in between column 9th and before last two represents `ArborescenceCount` with special frequency dump as defined above. My apologies for the trouble I just pushed a fix into the develop branch. However, we have significant other changes in develop branch too so recompilation might make your current index incompatible to `0.14.1` so if you don't wan't to reindex the reference then I'd not recompile from develop and the bugfix will available from the next version. Solution: The easiest solution is to remove `--dumpUMIgraph` if you don't need the flag and rerun then the only thing to handle is just change the header names. If rerunning alevin is too much work then I can forward you a python parser which can temporary handle the parsing.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/413#issuecomment-518443482:1946,avail,available,1946,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/413#issuecomment-518443482,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability," I did perform a random subsampling, ie. taking a read with a p probability while reading the fastq files, p being the subsampling coefficient I did mention (pE[0;1]). An implementation of this approach as an option during the transcript quantification would be great. I can provide you with the simple python script I use for the subsampling, but I am not sure if it is the proper way to subsample during alevin quantification. >when you say cellranger subsampling, do you mean the cellranger aggregate pipeline?. Yes, sorry for not clearly stating it. I did use the cellranger aggregate function indeed, which by default subsample the expression matrices with high sequencing depth depending on amount of mapped reads, if I understand well. >Use Alevin w/o any modification to the fastq on both of your sample to generate the gene count matrices. I already did that, in downstream analyses I have a batch effect issue related to the sequencing depth. >that's why we recommend using the Seurat package downstream of the Alevin quantified matrices. I have some experience with downstream analyses with Seurat, Pagoda, Scater, scanpy and a few other tools, and I am aware of batch correction methods like CCA or MNN. But that is not what I am looking for here. I did both CCA and MNN but I loose some important information in the resulting eigenspaces or corrected matrix. I believe the proper way to correct my batch effect is to simply fix the difference between my two libraries, ie. the sequencing depth in this case. As I explained in my first message, cellranger aggregate (subsampling based on the amount of mapped reads) works very well in my case, correct the effect without any loss or modification of important genes in our scientific question. Not CCA or MNN. I would like to be able to do the same from the alevin quantifications. So I am looking for a proper way to apply a correction before/during/after the alevin quantification, in a way similar to what cellranger do with STAR.

Availability," I’ve done some sleuthing and have (seemingly) figured out what’s going on. I compared tons of overlapping transcript scenarios and played with the salmon options and concluded the following:. 1. **Success scenarios:** Generally, with default options, Salmon does an excellent job at assigning reads to overlapping transcripts the same way that a human would. Whether or not the transcripts overlap slightly or one is entirely contained within another is irrelevant. 2. **Failure scenarios:** In some scenarios with overlapping transcripts, read assignment can be very strange and unintuitive, especially when one of the transcript isoforms is much more abundant than the other (the abundant transcript tends to “steal” reads from the less abundant one). 3. Both the success and failure scenarios are **due to the length bias model** used when estimating the abundance of transcripts. **Totally disabling this with the —noLengthCorrection flag** (NOT the —no**Effective**LengthCorrection flag) **actually *creates* the transcript within a transcript failure scenario that I mistakenly thought was the original issue.** That is, when length bias modeling is turned off, then longer transcripts will always get assigned *all* of the reads that multimap to shorter transcripts.; -Therefore... if you *did* want to tackle the transcript within a transcript scenario to build a coverage bias model, you probably want to disable the length bias modeling or at least consider how it would interact with coverage modeling. With that said, I'm sharing an example that illustrates each of the above points and a link to a toy dataset that you can use to recreate the examples or explore this further. If you'd like to dig deeper into this, free free to e-mail me at jason@calicolabs.com, I have tons more notes and data that I'm willing to share.

It's possible you are talking about some other step which I am not aware of but if it's `aggregate` then I think it happens downstream of all the quantification. Indeed coverage bias correction is an important part of the aggregation step but in general it's not the only one and that's why we recommend using the `Seurat` package downstream of the Alevin quantified matrices. We will be more than happy to write a tutorial on, ""how to perform batch correction downstream of Alevin"" but in summary the following steps would be the gist of the process.; - Use Alevin w/o any modification to the `fastq` on both of your sample to generate the gene count matrices. (We have made a major upgrade to the Alevin. We'd recommend using [v0.12.0-alpha](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/v0.12.0-alpha) for now, we are planning to make an official release before the end of this week, currently you can use pre-release. Unfortunately, not available on conda yet).; - Import Alevin count matrices into R using [this](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2018/alevin-seurat/) tutorial .; - Use [this](https://satijalab.org/seurat/immune_alignment.html) to perform the batch correction. ; We do realize it's currently complicated to use things downstream of Alevin and are working constantly on improving the overall pipeline to make the analyses as smooth as possible.

Availability," here with alevin, so it would mis-detect cells like the shifted ones you pasted above. For SPLiT-seq, we do know exactly which barcodes go into the wells, however, so it is technically possible to restrict based on all possible known combinations of barcodes instead and be more positionally flexible. But deciding how many indel bases are allowable, and presumably doing multiple passes through the data to establish an include-list could be time-consuming. Further, the zUMIs developer rightly mentions [in this thread](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/issues/63) that there are likely going to be _many_ unused barcode combinations this way, so lots of time could be spent looking for ""cells"" that don't actually exist in the data. The authors of the paper from which our test dataset was derived describe in their methods using a Drop-seq computational framework, so I'm not sure which approach theirs is more similar to. . The simplest approach here is certainly the automatic detection, but it will come at the cost of losing meaningful reads to frameshift errors. . My guess is this falls well out of the scope of alevin, but if you're interested in improving on that, there may be a middle ground between the two approaches above, one that I'm not sure if your group or others have attempted for other methods: we could essentially do a 2-pass barcode detection. The first pass would restrict based on positions like we're already doing, and establish an include-list of possible barcodes seen in the data. Then we could pass through the barcode sequences a second time, looking only for those sequence combinations, but allowing 1-2bp flexibility in the positions they occur, potentially rescuing some of the ones missed during the first pass. This would get around the issue of searching for thousands (or more) barcodes that never exist. . However, for your above sequences in red, we would still need to somehow collapse the barcodes `GATAGACA`, `ATAGACAT`, and `ATAGACAG`, but perhaps t",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-985554883:1307,error,errors,1307,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-985554883,2,['error'],['errors']

Availability," protocols, it is usually the case that we get 1 read -> 1 transcript, even if we don't read the whole thing. We have tested the effect of this in ONT data with spike ins, and have verified that using `--noLengthCorrection` does generally lead to improved accuracy with respect to quantification estimates. We have informed ONT of this, and I would guess they may optimize the flags that are used soon (we have also developed an error model that works correctly for these long reads, and that should make it into the next release of salmon). Regarding the effect this has on the `NumReads` values reported by salmon, it's not as simple as with the `TPM` estimates. The length affects the assigned reads through the probabilistic model on which inference is done. With the length effect we have that P(f | t_i) ∝ P( position | f, t_i ) * P( alignment | f, t_i) --- forgetting the alignment term for the time being, we have that with length correction P( position | f, t_i ) ∝ 1 / l_i and without length correction the l_i term goes away. In other words, the probability of allocating reads has a term that depends on the effective length when the `--noLengthCorrection` flag is not passed, but that term goes away when it is passed. This is not quite as drastic as with TPM where the normalization includes the length directly in the normalization (note, however, that when the `--noLengthCorrection` flag is passed, this adjusts the TPM as well). Further, the `NumReads` is still better than TPM in this regard because it still encodes the effect size (i.e. `NumReads` will sum to the total number of aligned reads). Anyway TLDR: Passing the `--noLengthCorrection` flag *is* better for ONT data, though results without this flag are sub-optimal, they are not unusable. We have let ONT know about this, and I would suspect they will address it (perhaps they'll even accept a PR?). Finally, a long read error model has been created and will _hopefully_ make it to the next version of salmon.

Availability," subsampling the Fastq, did you sample randomly across the full Fastq or chose the top X reads. Yes, I did perform a random subsampling, ie. taking a read with a p probability while reading the fastq files, p being the subsampling coefficient I did mention (pE[0;1]). An implementation of this approach as an option during the transcript quantification would be great. I can provide you with the simple python script I use for the subsampling, but I am not sure if it is the proper way to subsample during alevin quantification. >when you say cellranger subsampling, do you mean the cellranger aggregate pipeline?. Yes, sorry for not clearly stating it. I did use the cellranger aggregate function indeed, which by default subsample the expression matrices with high sequencing depth depending on amount of mapped reads, if I understand well. >Use Alevin w/o any modification to the fastq on both of your sample to generate the gene count matrices.

But that is not what I am looking for here. I did both CCA and MNN but I loose some important information in the resulting eigenspaces or corrected matrix. I believe the proper way to correct my batch effect is to simply fix the difference between my two libraries, ie. the sequencing depth in this case. As I explained in my first message, cellranger aggregate (subsampling based on the amount of mapped reads) works very well in my case, correct the effect without any loss or modification of important genes in our scientific question.

Availability," the right end of the transcript which is inconsistent with the coverage profile and, as hoped, salmon did not assign any reads to that variant. So, in these two scenarios the default options produce nice results in line with our human intuition. 2. **Failure scenario with default options:** ; ![PDI1_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10292386/86509895-3df36600-bda0-11ea-8f0b-df0de4fefa31.png); <img width=""383"" alt=""PDI1_table"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10292386/86509897-40ee5680-bda0-11ea-9566-9f2bdab464f0.png"">. In this example there are four genes (oriented in the same direction) with wildly different expression levels. I added a ""PDI1_SuperTranscript"" which stretches from the 5' end of PDI1 to the 3' end of POF1 (so, all reads from all 4 genes would multimap to the super transcript). This is a contrived example to illustrate the technical details, but you could imagine similar biological scenarios, especially regarding splicing isoforms. With the default options, you get the counterintuitive result that all of the reads from just MGR1 and POF1 (the two lowest abundance transcripts) are assigned to the super transcript. EMC1 loses ~50% of its reads to the super transcript, and PDI1 only loses ~10%. I'm not showing it, but if you remove the default PDI1 transcript from the index (so it's just the super transcript + the 3 genes MGR1/EMC1/POF1), all three of them lose all of their reads to the super transcript... meaning that whether or not EMC1 gets assigned any reads depends entirely on the presence of a non-overlapping gene, PDI1, in the salmon index. This is definitely at odds with our intuition from looking at the coverage plots, but makes sense when you break all the transcripts down to a simple reads per kb equation. As before, if you turn off length modeling then all of the reads get assigned to the super transcript. I hope this was insightful and cleared up the issue a bit. Feel free to e-mail or reply here.

In this example, there are two regions in KCC4 with obviously different coverage. Ideally we would be able to have a default KCC4 transcript and a truncated isoform in the salmon index, and it would assign the reads appropriately, even though all of the reads that map to the truncated form would also multimap to the long form. Again, you can see in the table that salmon assigns reads parsimoniously to both transcripts with the default options, but with the length bias modeling turned off ALL of the reads are assigned to the long transcript. I also added a third transcript to the right end of the transcript which is inconsistent with the coverage profile and, as hoped, salmon did not assign any reads to that variant. So, in these two scenarios the default options produce nice results in line with our human intuition. 2. **Failure scenario with default options:** ; ![PDI1_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10292386/86509895-3df36600-bda0-11ea-8f0b-df0de4fefa31.png); <img width=""383"" alt=""PDI1_table"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10292386/86509897-40ee5680-bda0-11ea-9566-9f2bdab464f0.png"">. In this example there are four genes (oriented in the same direction) with wildly different expression levels. I added a ""PDI1_SuperTranscript"" which stretches from the 5' end of PDI1 to the 3' end of POF1 (so, all reads from all 4 genes would multimap to the super transcript). This is a contrived example to illustrate the technical details, but you could imagine similar biological scenarios, especially regarding splicing isoforms. With the default options, you get the counterintuitive result that all of the reads from just MGR1 and POF1 (the two lowest abundance transcripts) are assigned to the super transcript.

This is because reads that align to the same reference position can easily have come from alternative transcripts sharing the same underlying sequence.

Indeed. > And with just RapMap output you would lose other information that Salmon uses to determine likely fragment assignment?. You would lose information (in the format of a CIGAR string) that Salmon uses in alignment mode, but not any information, I think, that Salmon uses in quasi-mapping-based mode (though one would incur a non-trivial performance hit for filtering the quasi-mappings through file / disk rather than dealing with them directly in memory as Salmon normally does). > With UMI's you can deduplicate fragments before inferring where they were likely to come from. Ideally you would deduplicate the reads directly based on UMI, then you wouldn't have to think about PCR duplication in the quantification. But of course keeping a hash of all reads in a FASTQ and accounting for dequencing errors wouldn't be really tractable.. I guess this is the real question I have. Specifically, what is the true computational burden to detect and eliminate duplicates using UMIs? In theory, the reads must (1) map to the same location and (2) have the same UMI tag. How often would one expect the UMI tag to be modified / corrupted / etc.? Would you have to search all 1 or 2 hamming distance neighbors to detect duplicates reliably? Is an equivalence class a sufficient proxy for ""mapping to the same location"", or do we also care that e.g. the position of the fragment within each transcript is a duplicate as well?

Availability,"@moschmi,. @roryk's parsing of the error is exactly what is intended. Specifically, alevin is looking to map the transcript `PB.40054.21` to a gene, but it is not finding that transcript in the file `PacBio/single_cell_pipeline/sqanti3_output/Alin_neg_txp2gene.tsv`. The question is a bit trickier when you have your own long-read derived transcriptome, since I don't know the process by which you are grouping transcripts into genes. It is always possible to have a transcript be its own gene (by having it appear in both the first and second columns in the same line of this file) — however, then you will lose information about how this transcript and other transcripts belonging to the same gene are related, which plays into how alevin quantifies gene-level abundance.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/540#issuecomment-648204069:35,error,error,35,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/540#issuecomment-648204069,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"@rob-p thanks for tagging me. I missed the primary discussion and went over it. ; @reganhayward , thanks for posting this interesting phenomenon. Checking for ambiguity is data driven, there are many sources of ambiguity, ; 1. Exon sharing (when both the transcripts share a splicing even and thereby share an exon.) ; 2. They originate from genes that ae paralogs of each other. ; 3. They share sequence of read length without an obvious clue (might stem some evolutionary event in the past.). Looking into the ensemble database `ENST00000374675.7` originates from [ENSG00000112473](https://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?g=ENSG00000112473;r=6:33168222-33172216) and `ENST00000428189.5` belongs to [ENSG00000229470.5](https://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Location/View?db=core;g=ENSG00000229470;r=HSCHR6_MHC_DBB:30499388-30515186). The second one comes from an alternate assembly according to ensemble from the same chromosome 6. There is a possibility that there is exon sharing. But I can not be sure before doing a blast etc. . There is a way from salmon to track this down. If you use `-d` option for dumping equivalence classes then, we can check for equivalence classes where these transcripts occur. If they co-occure in an equivalence class then we could be sure that it is due to read sharing. If you can provide me the equivalence class file (should be a smaller one), I can look into it. The gibbs/bootstraps would come handy once we know the equivalence classes, since it will reveal how the uncertain the estimates are for these two transcripts when compared to their equivalence class members. .

Availability,"@tamuanand,. Right now, I added the code to dump the _salmon_ version into versionInfo.json. Which is a standard json file that goes in the index directory. Actually, that file already contains an index version key, which is simply a number that is incremented every time there is a change made that alters the binary representation of the index on disk. That is particularly useful because not every salmon version requires re-building the index. Regarding the feature I've added. It's fairly standard practice for us to put information that is meant to be read by both humans and machines (scripts, R packages downstream, etc.) into a JSON file. This makes it easy to access it simply from many languages, and to have _some_ (but not too much) structure to this data. There are even slick command line tools for pulling info out of JSON files (like [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)).

Availability,"A bit delayed, but this relates to the questions I've been asking on the salmon gitter. . First, it's worth pointing out that the new 10x (v2) sequencing is a lot more like other bead methods, where (i) index reads (i7/i5) are for labelling biological samples (ii) read1 contains the combined cell and molecular/UMI barcodes (ii) read2 is the transcript 3' read. So it seems there is now some data format convergence. Either way, I'd guess that ongoing iterations of the high throughput platforms will keep one read for the transcript 3', reserving the other 2 or 3 reads for some combination of the sample, cell and molecular barcodes. . Before thinking about how to best collapse UMIs, there's also the issue of how best to QC the barcodes and beads. Jim Namesh has [some functions](http://mccarrolllab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Drop-seqAlignmentCookbookv1.2Jan2016.pdf); as does [Vasilis Ntranos](https://github.com/pachterlab/scRNA-Seq-TCC-prep/blob/master/README.md). Arguably this has nothing to do with salmon/kallisto though I think the kallisto guys were smart to include it. It's a good filter even if only for speeding things up. Then it's really what might be the most appropriate demultiplexing of fastqs to allow compatibility between tecnhiques, I guess. I quite like how the kallisto workflow ends up with a fastq per cell together with a matching UMI file. Then at the very least one can ignore the UMIs (perhaps going with what @vals suggests). Not sure if that's helpful. But thought to chime in as somebody we would love to see salmon working on the high throughput single-cell platforms that have sample, cell and molecular barcodes. Even if only to test how worthwhile UMIs genuinely are for most applications. This may be a controversial comment, but I suspect for me UMIs will largely end up the same way as spike-ins: useful for quantifying endogenous RNA recovered per cell but perhaps not all that useful beyond that for low read depth single-cell signature profiling.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/93#issuecomment-265619589:1912,recover,recovered,1912,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/93#issuecomment-265619589,1,['recover'],['recovered']

I am having a related issue with 0 reads being found by Salmon:; TBX21 transcripts ENST00000177694 and ENST00000581328 both report 0 read counts, but I am confident there are plenty of reads from these transcripts. (1) download sra and fastq-dump, (2) trim_galore (3) fastQC (4) STAR to generate aligned bams (for other analyses) and Salmon in mapping-based mode to get transcript counts. I am using the same transcript annotation for STAR and Salmon. . When I samtools view the aligned bam over the TBX21 region, I get back >4000 paired reads.

Availability,"Dear @callumparr,. Thank you for bringing this up. So you are correct that the `--noLengthCorrection` flag should be passed to salmon when quantifying data that does not have a ""fragmentation effect"", that is, where the number of fragments we expect to draw from a transcript is not dependent upon the length of that transcript. In the ONT protocols, it is usually the case that we get 1 read -> 1 transcript, even if we don't read the whole thing. We have tested the effect of this in ONT data with spike ins, and have verified that using `--noLengthCorrection` does generally lead to improved accuracy with respect to quantification estimates. We have informed ONT of this, and I would guess they may optimize the flags that are used soon (we have also developed an error model that works correctly for these long reads, and that should make it into the next release of salmon). Regarding the effect this has on the `NumReads` values reported by salmon, it's not as simple as with the `TPM` estimates. The length affects the assigned reads through the probabilistic model on which inference is done. With the length effect we have that P(f | t_i) ∝ P( position | f, t_i ) * P( alignment | f, t_i) --- forgetting the alignment term for the time being, we have that with length correction P( position | f, t_i ) ∝ 1 / l_i and without length correction the l_i term goes away. In other words, the probability of allocating reads has a term that depends on the effective length when the `--noLengthCorrection` flag is not passed, but that term goes away when it is passed. This is not quite as drastic as with TPM where the normalization includes the length directly in the normalization (note, however, that when the `--noLengthCorrection` flag is passed, this adjusts the TPM as well). Further, the `NumReads` is still better than TPM in this regard because it still encodes the effect size (i.e. `NumReads` will sum to the total number of aligned reads). Anyway TLDR: Passing the `--noLengthCorrectio",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/651#issuecomment-821995147:768,error,error,768,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/651#issuecomment-821995147,2,['error'],['error']

Availability,"From my somewhat superficial understanding, I have feeling that it is the only the soft clipping (deletion at either end) that causes the problem (and not INDELs in general). I think it might be better if the CIGAR string contained the soft clipping operations (the POS would still need to be shifted) of course. Right now when one visualizes the BAM file various distracting artifacts manifest themselves with both salmon and kallisto even when the POS field is correct. See the image below:. ![Alignments](https://www.ialbert.me/static/down/pseudo_alignments/pseudo_aln.png). (Top Kallisto, second Salmon, bottom Hisat. ). The soft clipped sequences are not marked as such, therefore lead to ugly misalignment at the ends, that in turn dominate the visualization. .

Availability,"Got it, thanks for the heads up. I'd probably reach out to the refgenie people about the hg38 specific versions. It makes sense to have the feature of having the gtf at the time of indexing. The only concern I have is that mandating to have the gtf might restrict the overall workflow by a bit. Specifically because a user might not always have the full GTF available for every use case, although we can always make having GTF as an optional requirement for indexing. Adding the support should not be too difficult but it will certainly add a new logic path which would need thorough testing. . We'll certainly keep you updated with the feature as we progress although it can take some time to get back. In terms of your pipeline one option would be to actually save the GTF explicitly in the salmon index folder post indexing.

Availability,"HI @gianfilippo ,; I think #245 might help understanding the problem better.; Specifically to answer your questions, I am guessing `737K-august-2016.txt` is all the set of Cellular Barcodes(CB) being whitelisted by 10xGenomics protocol while in Alevin when you are giving external whitelist it assumes that the user is pretty confident about the presence of *all* the given CBs in their experiment. for example if you want to compare Alevin and cellranger apple to apple then you might have to give the `barcodes.tsv`(usually is present along with the `mtx` file) generated by the cellranger. (after removing `-1` from the CB names). ; `[alevinLog] [error] Barcode not found in frequency table`: This error means some of the CB given externally through the whitelist command seems to have no reads at all which violates the above assumption, you can potentially skip this error by using `--debug` flag with alevin (only if have version v0.11.3) but this mode has is yet to be extensively tested.; In case where you don't externally give whitelist CB, Alevin uses knee and KDE based method to identify the cutoff on the knee (and later correct for it) of the CB distribution.

Availability,"Happy to compare notes! For benchmarking accuracy I'm mostly using data from SEQC. There are four reference samples, each sequenced quite deeply at several different labs. I took 20 lanes from BGI, which is about 100 million reads, which I compare it to TaqMan (~800 genes), PrimePCR on (~18000 genes), and ERCC spike-ins. . On top of that, to get more directly at isoform-level accuracy, I'm simulating data using rlsim, which I've found to be the least awful RNA-Seq simulator. Unlike most simulators, it models some technical effects/bias. I think it underestimates these, but still a lot better than most that assume perfect uniform random sampling, etc. I also have a set of benchmarks designed to get at the question of consistency or stability of estimates, which is one of the main thrusts of the paper I'm working on. The other aspect I've been fretting about a lot the last month has been just what metric to use. You should check out this paper if you haven't seen it, which is pretty eye-opening as to the problems with using correlation on compositional gene expression data. > Lovell, D., Pawlowsky-Glahn, V., Egozcue, J. J., Marguerat, S., & Bähler, J. (2015). Proportionality: a valid alternative to correlation for relative data. PLoS Computational Biology, 11(3), e1004075. http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075. Those problems aren't unique to correlation. E.g. the ""median relative difference"" approach taken by the Kallisto paper is very much affected by this, I think even more so than correlation. The method I've adopted is to use the ""proportionality correlation"" they propose on page 9, and add 0.1 TPM to expression values to account for zeros and tiny values. It's not terribly sensitive to the additive constant and gives pretty reliable results in my experience.

Availability,"Hello! I did some work with the oxford nanopore error model last summer. There's a blog post about the ONT long read quantification here: https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon-tutorials/2021/ont-long-read-quantification/ . In terms of length correction, the --ont flag basically turns off length correction (since it doesn't really apply to long reads). The error model that the current version of salmon uses for the --ont flag (found in src/ONTAlignmentModel.cpp) basically bins reads by length (into 4 bins by default, I believe). Then for each bin it learns a binomial/geometric distribution for the number of errors (mismatches or indels) in the alignment of the reads in the bin, as well as distributions for the number of bases softclipped at the beginning and end of the read. It then uses these models to penalize reads that have an amount of errors/softclips that is very different from the center of the learned distribution, only if the number of errors/softclips is larger than what we expect for that bin (since a smaller than expected number of errors in the alignment is generally a good, not a bad sign for how likely the read is to map to this transcript). I'm not the original author/creator of this model, so I don't have all the details on specifics of how it works/the design decisions that went into it, but let me know if you have any other questions I can answer!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/924#issuecomment-2148242254:48,error,error,48,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/924#issuecomment-2148242254,12,['error'],"['error', 'errors']"
Availability,"Hello,. I've actually been thinking of a different method that would require very stringent mapping. By providing transcripts of only exon 1 & 2, exon 2 & 3, and exon 1 & 3 I could get a better idea of the number of reads that skip exon 2 all together. Also, by averaging the read counts that map to the junctions of exon 1 & 2 and exon 2 & 3, I can help eliminate polyA tail bias that is heavily positioned towards exon 1 and would also allow me to get a more accurate prediction of the two gene versions since 1 read mapped to exon 1 & 2 and 1 read mapped to exon 2 & 3 would essentially tell me twice that the gene is there while a read mapped to exon 1 & 3 would only tell me once that the gene is there. However, doing so would force me to bring ```AuxSampleNumber``` down to very low numbers such as 10 - 100 as using stringent coverage parameters drastically reduces my reads mapped. . I do wonder though how these low AUX numbers might affect your model development and algorithm.

Availability,"Hi @Beatzekatze,. The issue with test 1 seems to be from CMake being unable to find the unit test to execute under certain configurations. I'll consider this a bug in the CMake file, and look into fixing it. The failure of tests 2 and 3 is more interesting, as one would definitely not expect this given that the program compiled without error. Does indexing fail only with `--type fmd`, or also with `--type quasi` (or no `--type` as that is the default)? Would it be possible to run the command under gdb and report the stack trace? That would be something like:. ```; $ gdb --args salmon index -t transcripts.fasta -i sample_salmon_fmd_index --type fmd; ```. and then, when you encounter the segfault issuing the back-trace `bt` command. This would give insight into where, exactly this is showing up. One issue I've seen before is when the resident installation of Boost is _not_ compiled with `--std=c++11` (or 14 or 17), since this leads to an incompatible ABI between salmon and the Boost library. If that's what's going on, it should be evident from the backtrace.

Availability,"Hi @Davidwei7,. Thank you for the very detailed bug report! So, I have two initial responses / thoughts about your issue. First, you asked if the issue may be related to a memory allocation error wherein the index didn't build successfully. This is quite possible (and the error you see during quantification is consistent with that). The *full* decoy index is substantially larger than the index on just the transcriptome (after all, it is indexing the entire human genome in addition to the transcriptome). One thing you might try to test this hypothesis, other than requesting to build on a node with more RAM, is to compute a hash (e.g. md5 or sha256 sum) on all of the files in the index, and also record their sizes. Then we can build the index on the same version of the files on our end and compare. Second — and perhaps more importantly for your end goal — the main purpose of the decoy-aware index is to improve specificity rather than sensitivity. That is, the decoys are designed to help avoid _spurious_ mapping of reads to an annotated transcript when a better explanation for the read exists elsewhere in the genome. However, the reads that are mapped to decoys are not otherwise used for quantification. Thus, using the decoy aware transcriptome index is unlikely to improve your mapping rate. I agree that your mapping rate does seem rather low. There are a few potential culprits here, and some diagnostics we can look at to see what might be going wrong. First, you can take a look at the file `aux_info/meta_info.json` in the salmon quantification directories to get a few more details about why reads were not mapped. If you share one of those files here I can describe the relevant fields. Also, I have two more rather common things to consider that might affect the mapping rate. One is to add the sequence for the ribosomal RNAs to your transcriptome before indexing and then quantifying. If your mapping rate increases considerably, this is evidence of rather inefficient depl",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/603#issuecomment-744162850:190,error,error,190,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/603#issuecomment-744162850,2,['error'],['error']

""Since v3.0 of the pipeline, featureCounts is no longer used to perform gene/transcript quantification, however it is still used to generate QC metrics based on [biotype](http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/biotypes.html) information available within GFF/GTF genome annotation files. This decision was made primarily because of the limitations of featureCounts to appropriately quantify gene expression data. Please see [Zhao et al., 2015](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141910#pone-0141910-t001) and [Soneson et al., 2015](https://f1000research.com/articles/4-1521/v1)."". This is a common cause of confusion and I have tried to be as explicit about this in the docs. featureCounts is used to quantify features in the annotation by `gene_biotype` and not the actual gene / transcript features themselves. This may explain why you are seeing these discrepancies. However, I am still a little puzzled how you are able to directly compare the counts generated by featureCounts and Salmon (in either mode) because the core features that are being quantified should be different. Where did you get the plant reference genome from? If it's not from Ensembl then it probably isn't worth running the biotype quantification with featureCounts anyway because the GTF annotation files may not contain that information. There are some docs for this [here](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.8.1/usage#prokaryotic-genome-annotations).

Availability,"Hi @GWW ,. Ok, we figured out where the threads are coming from. Deep inside the concurrent hash map we are using, there is a [function that grows the hash map](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/blob/master/include/cuckoohash_map.hh#L1558). This function uses a function called [`parallel_exec`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/blob/master/include/cuckoohash_map.hh#L1751) to move the items from the old table to the new one. Here, they greedily use as many threads as available for that process. We can't see this behavior on our end by monitoring top/htop, because the hash table doubling happens so fast it's below the monitoring resolution. There are a couple ways to address this, one of which is hacking inside the hashmap library to modify this behavior.

Availability,"Hi @Hoohm , ; Thanks for the quick reply and the explanation . I personally am not very well versed in the working of `SCRBseq`. But, as you explained, knowing a set of whitelist CB beforehand is always a plus for the downstream working of the pipeline. Currently, Alevin merge all the observed CB which are 1-edit distance from a known whitelist CB towards the whitelist. The underlying assumption being that the sequencing error (although with low probability) can change CB sequence and we can correct for that. I wonder, is this right to do for your experiment ?. re: >Is there an option for max distance allowed between BC or UMI?; Sorry, but I don't completely understand this question. When you say distance allowed between CB and UMI, do you mean there is a sequence between CB and UMI ( like in in-drop seq)? If that's the case then we might have to tweak a bit in alevin command line flags again. But I suspect what you meant by above statement is -- max distance allowed between CB among themselves. If that's the question then unfortunately we currently allow correcting for only 1-edit distance for both CB and UMI.

Availability,"Hi @Kisekya,. So BWA-MEM and BWA-MEM2 are somewhat of a problem to begin with because they perform local alignment, which isn't really ideal for aligning RNA-seq reads to the transcriptome. If you really wish to use an aligner, we've had good experiences with Bowtie2 (when used in the appropriate end-to-end alignment mode) and with STAR (using the alignments projected to the transcriptome with `--quantMode TranscriptomeSAM` flag to output the alignments in transcriptomic coordinates as required by salmon). Apart from the local alignment issue, sorting the BAM file is _absolutely_ a problem for salmon, and is likely why you get the strange library type. When run in alignment mode, just like RSEM, salmon requires the alignments for the the mates of a read pair to appear subsequently in the file, and for all alignments for a given read to appear contiguously in the file. This allows parsing the reads without having to require potentially unbounded memory (holding the record for one end of a fragment in memory while waiting for the record for the other end). In fact, given that you've sorted the alignments here, I'm surprised you're not getting the ""suspicious pair"" warnings in your logs. The ISR library with 40% mapping is likely a more reliable number. The obvious question here is why might the mapping rate be this low? There are a few reasons you might see something like this. One, for example, is poor ribosomal depletion, paired with not having all of the rRNA sequences in your index. In this case, you have many fewer reads coming from the rest of the transcriptome and you get depleted mapping rates like this. . Could you say a bit more about the experimental setup? Is this in a well-annotated organism like human / mouse etc.? Is this a polyA selection or ribosomal depletion prep? Anything else that might be relevant to sample quality?.

Availability,"Hi @OnlyHigh,. Indeed, the _default_ behavior of salmon is to de-duplicate transcripts (to avoid that behavior and allow salmon to index duplicate transcripts, you need to pass the `--keepDuplicates` flag to the indexer). When it does this, it will log the duplicate transcripts in the index. If you look in the directory containing the salmon index, you will find a file called `duplicate_clusters.tsv`. This is a 2 column TSV file with a row for each transcript that was collapsed during indexing. The first column says which retained transcript was identical to the collapsed transcript. We do not write down the specific sequence of these transcripts, but with the original fasta file on which the index was built, you can easily extract this.

Availability,"Hi @PeteHaitch ,; Thanks for your interest in *Alevin*.; Although in current Alevin we have concentrated mainly on learning more about Droplet based 3'-tagged single cell protocols, especially 10x; we are very much interested in extending it towards other protocols like CEL-seq.; However, there are couple of challenges/difference which should be considered before incorporating it into the Alevin pipeline. Currently Alevin relies on the fact that the droplet based protocols use PCR amplification of the library and the UMI deduplication phase of Alevin assumes an exponential model, I am not sure how true is this with CEL-seq? Another issue is that CEL-seq is a Fluidigm based system while the current application for Alevin is for microfluidics based. In general we have observed that the 10x cell isolation step is pretty robust in reporting the Cellular Barcodes(CB) and although we have a probabilisitic model to handle the CB based uncertainty but the ambiguous case like that are very less frequent, (although not true for Drop-Seq).

Availability,"Hi @ShenTTT,. First, thank you for the detailed analysis (and for doing the work of looking up this issue in past posts). If the (trimmed) reads are of high quality and there aren't signs of contamination, my initial hunch would be that there are a considerable number of reads coming from outside of the annotated transcriptome (that is, I would suspect `2` to be the most likely culprit here). I don't think this is because of DNA `contamination` necessarily, but rather because of novel transcripts that don't appear in your annotation. Obviously, salmon can only quantify what it knows about in terms of annotated transcripts. If you are concerned about these mapping rates, one thing you might try is to do transcript assembly in these samples (using e.g. scallop or StringTie2) and then re-quantify using salmon under the expanded annotation. Also, while you are losing ~5M reads to low mapping scores (suggesting they are not a good match for the underlying annotated transcripts), this doesn't seem to be what is driving your overall mapping rate (i.e. this is only ~15% of fragments, so the rest of the difference between 85% and 56% comes from reads that don't fall into this category). Finally, while you may be able to ""recover"" more reads by lowering the mapping threshold `--minScoreFraction` from its default value of 0.65, that default is actually pretty liberal (especially for trimmed reads). So this would be letting in quite low-quality alignments. Note that, if you have unannotated isoforms that share sequence (exons) with annotated isoforms, this could partly describe what you are seeing with some of these reads, where part of the read aligns but part does not (because it comes from an unannotated splice form).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/533#issuecomment-638929976:1232,recover,recover,1232,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/533#issuecomment-638929976,1,['recover'],['recover']
Availability,"Hi @Tima-Ze,. This should not cause any trouble with downstream analysis. The indexing procedure is simply informing you that these transcripts (about which you are being warned) are shorter than the seed length used for alignment. This means that it simply won't be possible for fragments to align to these transcripts, and so they will always have a 0 abundance in the resulting `quant.sf` files. This isn't a problem, as these transcripts are too short to be measured via RNA-seq anyway. The indexing messages just let you know this in advance. You can safely ignore these warnings for your downstream analysis.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/214#issuecomment-751366278:53,down,downstream,53,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/214#issuecomment-751366278,4,['down'],['downstream']
Availability,"Hi @Tima-Ze,. Yes, salmon can be used to quantify these reads, but the results will depend (somewhat) on the `--fldMean` and `--fldSD` flags that are used. It's important to note that this is not a unique characteristic of salmon, and any transcript-level quantification tool using a probabilistic model (e.g. RSEM, eXpress, BitSeq, etc.) have the same requirement. That is, the fragment length distribution should be known so that _effective_ transcript lengths can be estimated, which have an effect on fragment assignment probabilities. If the wrong fragment length distribution is specified, then the _effective_ transcript lengths will be off and this can affect the assignment of some fragments. This is only a requirement with single-end reads, since with paired-end reads the fragment length distribution is learned from the data. Further, the inference procedure is somewhat robust to these choices (small changes in fld mean and sd don't generally lead to drastically different results). If you have access to the BioAnalyzer results for the sequencing run, those can give information about the fragment length distribution (even in a single end experiment). If not, you can proceed with the default values. Even if they don't exactly match the true distribution in the single-end sample, at least the same values will be applied in all samples and so, ideally, most results of misspecification will wash out in subsequent differential analysis. . Finally, it's worth noting that the same restriction holds in both alignment-based and mapping-based modes. This is because in neither mode do single-end fragments provide sufficient information to estimate the fragment length distribution from the data. We only know where one end of a fragment mapped and cannot infer where the other end would be. This is not an alignment versus mapping (versus selective-alignment) issue, but rather is fundamental to having only observed one side of the entire fragment generated during fragmentation and ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/127#issuecomment-750920243:884,robust,robust,884,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/127#issuecomment-750920243,2,['robust'],['robust']

Availability,"Hi @bounlu,. Thank you for the detailed report. The mapping rate certainly does seem very low. To answer your specific questions first:; 1) I'm not sure --- let's try tor find out; 2) I don't think so (if they are part of your index, they should be aligned against); 3) If there are many transcripts / targets you expect to be sequenced but which aren't present in this set, that can affect the mapping rate, but not likely to take it down to 6%. Here are the things I'd investigate --- roughly in order: . 1) In addition to the fraction of reads STAR mapped (which you report above), what fraction of the reads are assigned to features by featureCounts? In some cases, when there is a failure of rRNA depletion of polyA selection, you can end up with an experiment where most of the sequenced RNA comes from rRNA not present in the reference transcriptome. In this case, STAR will be able to align the reads to the genome, but you won't see these reads mapping to annotated features (and you also won't see them showing up in your transcript level quantifications). So, it may be worth to take a look at the count of reads assigned to the feature set of genes by featureCounts. 2) Above, it looks like a considerable number of fragments were discarded due to no alignment reaching the required alignment score (`11,448,458` fragments discarded because of this). Have you tried to adapter / quality trim the data? Does this have any effect on the mapping rate?. 3) If the above don't reveal any clues, I'd be happy to try to take a look at the data if you can share it. I'd be quite surprised if STAR is aligning a lot of reads *to transcriptome features* that are being missed by salmon. Nonetheless, if you pass the proper flags to STAR (including `--quantMode TranscriptomeSAM`), then you can use the SAM/BAM file generated by STAR to perform quantification with salmon (i.e. use STAR's alignments to do _transcript-level_ quantification).

Availability,"Hi @bsipos,. This is caused primarily by salmon's desire to apply an error model (by default) to the CIGAR strings. For secondary alignments, as you note, minmap2 doesn't write the read string, and so when salmon is trying to score the alignments under the error model, it can't find the relevant characters in the read. In general, it's not clear to me if one would actually want to apply the error model (designed primarily for short reads) when quantifying long reads (this is something we are currently testing in the lab). For the time being, I'd probably recommend disabling the error model when quantifying alignments from long reads (`--noErrorModel`). In that case, the errors should hopefully go away.

Availability,"Hi @callumparr,. Thank you for the detailed report. I think this is primarily an error in documentation. The `gencode` flag is intended to be used only with ""mapping-based"" mode and when creating the index. It ensures that the index (and hence the resulting quantifications) contain the shortened names for gencode transcripts. In alignment-based mode, the behavior of the flag would have to be slightly different. It would have to re-normalize not only the names of the reference sequences in the fasta file, but it would also have to re-normalize the names in the BAM header so that they match. Specifically, the requirement is that the names of the sequences in the input fasta file are a 1-1 match with the names in the BAM header so that transcripts can be matched up properly with their sequences for training and applying the error model. However, if your BAM file already contains the stripped transcript names (i.e. if the BAM file header has the names without everything past the initial `|`), then I believe you can use the following command to have salmon do the same to the fasta file on the fly, so that the names match. ```{bash}; salmon-1.5.1_linux_x86_64/bin/salmon quant --ont -p 4 -t <(awk '{ if ($0 ~ ""^>"") { split($0,a,""|""); print a[1] } else { print $0 } }' Genome_files/gencode.vM24.transcripts.fa) -l U -a Documents/Day2_03_DRS_pass.bam -o Documents/counts/Day2_03_DRS_pass; ```. If the BAM file contains the ""full"" transcript name however, I think the current options are either to let salmon use the full transcript name from the fasta file, or to modify the GTF when running with minimap2, so that the BAM file itself contains the shortened names. Finally, I'd like to mention that the way you _intended_ to use the `--gencode` flag in alignment mode actually makes _a lot_ of sense, and I think it would be a very nice feature. Basically, the idea would be to apply stripping everything after the first `|` from *both* the fasta header and the BAM header, and using the red",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/671#issuecomment-860792782:81,error,error,81,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/671#issuecomment-860792782,2,['error'],['error']

Availability,"Hi @cwarden45 ,. So `--whitelist` flag is not intended to consume the 737k list of CB you are providing, that's why the error. Thanks for the issue in the doc, I updated it. Idea behind the flag is to externally provide a list of high confidence barcodes potentially identified by different tools like Cellranger, and quantify *only* those barcodes. One use case would be to take the output file `barcodes.tsv` of the cellranger and provide it to flag and quantify only those barcodes. Briefly, alevin doesn't use the 737k list of barcodes at all, it identifies barcodes empirically. If you'd like to quantify using the 737k list of barcodes, checkout the next generation of alevin tool, called [alevin-fry](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/682#issuecomment-877325227:120,error,error,120,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/682#issuecomment-877325227,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"Hi @danphillips28,. Oh ok! Now I see what's going on. We really should be more stringent about catching the issue here. . The problem is that using k > 32 is not permitted in the current implementation. This is because we use a 64-bit machine word to encode k-mers, and you can only fit up to 32 nucleotides in a word. In reality, anything > 31 is not allowed, since the k-mer should be odd so that the orientation can be inferred from the canonical (lexicographically smaller) version. There is nothing fundamentally problematic about using a larger k, it's just that it would require some modifications throughout the codebase we've not yet made. Further, we've not really found cases where having such large k really help. Specifically, the larger k, the fewer errors you need to render a read unmappable (if there is an error in every k-mer, you can't map the read). On the other hand, selective alignment will do a good job of filtering out poor matches where there is insufficient similarity between the read and reference. Thus, we set a default value of k=31. You can go lower (with any odd value), but it's not currently possible to go higher. I hope this clears things up, and thanks for bringing this to our attention. I think the indexer should bail with an error in this case, until (and unless) this feature is supported.

Unfortunately adding multiple versioned is gonna be little complicated as I might have to discuss with the alevin team and that might take some time.

Currently we are in the process of figuring out a better way to handle new protocols.; Having said that it should not stop users from using alevin with previous version of quartzseq2, you can use the following command line triplet as `--end 5 --barcodeLength 14 --umiLength 8` along with you other alevin flag and it's gonna behave just like `QuartzSeq2v31` you specified above.

I noticed you are passing a coordinate sorted BAM file. For quantification with salmon, you really should not be passing a coordinate sorted BAM.

Availability,"Hi @gambardella,. Thanks for the effort in tracking this down further. So, I tried running locally with more threads than we have physically, but the bug wasn't immediately triggered, so I'm guessing there is some stochasticity there. One thing that would be really helpful (given our lack of success in reproducing locally yet) is to find out if the issue is being caused by the compacted De Bruijn graph construction library, or prior to that. One way to do that is to ask the indexer to keep around the ""fixed fasta"", and then to see if that differs from we're producing locally on our machine. If you run the following command:. ```; salmon index -t gentrome.fa.gz -d decoys.txt -p 12 -i salmon_index --gencode --keepFixedFasta; ```. then there should be a file `salmon_index/ref_k31_fixed.fa` that is generated in the index directory. This is a fixed fasta file (removing ambiguous nucleotides, trimming polyA tails, removing sequences that are too short (<= k), etc.). In my runs, I get the same md5sum for this file, regardless of the number of threads:. ```; $ md5sum salmon_index/ref_k31_fixed.fa; ceaf3a96bfc2a65e70b6f3094d02491c salmon_index/ref_k31_fixed.fa; ```. could you see if you get something different (on a passing run, on a failing run, or on both)? If so, I might be able to replicate the bug by starting from your fixed fasta file, rather than from the original fasta files. Regarding your other question :. > Would you now advise to drop the ""-k 31""?. This should make no difference to the indexing procedure. While `-k` is an important parameter, 31 is the default value. Therefore, if you run the command without providing `-k` explicitly, it will use k=31.

Availability,"Hi @gringer,. Yes, we can add a section for this in the docs. It will replace the old way for specifying geometry soon, as its just easier and more flexible. We talk about it in the 1.4.0 release notes. I copy the relevant info below (@k3yavi pulled for the 1-based indexing and won out ... this time):. generic barcode / umi / read geometry syntax : Alevin learned to support a generic syntax to specify the read sequence that should be used for barcodes, UMIs and the read sequence. The syntax allows one to specify how the pattern corresponding to the barcode, UMI, and read sequence should be pieced together, and the syntax is meant to be intuitive and general. For example, one can specify the 10Xv2 geometry in the following manner using the generic syntax:. --read-geometry 2[1-end] --bc-geometry 1[1-16] --umi-geometry 1[17-26]. This specifies that the ""sequence"" read (the biological sequence to be aligned) comes from read 2, and it spans from the first index 1 (this syntax used 1-based indexing) until the end of the read. Likewise, the barcode derives from read 1 and occupies positions 1-16, and the UMI comes from read 1 and occupies positions 17-26. The syntax can specify multiple ranges, and they will simply be concatenated together to produce the string. For example, one could specify --bc-geometry 1[1-8,16-23] to designate that the barcode should be taken from the substring in positions 1-8 of read 1 followed by the substring in positions 16-23 of read 1. It is even possible to have the string pieced together across both reads, but that functionality is only available if you are running with --rad or --sketch and preparing a RAD file for alevin-fry. If you are running classic alevin, the barcode must reside on a single read.

Availability,"Hi @guidohooiveld, . Regarding your questions:. (1) The motivation behind asking users to use Bioconda to install the binary is to limit the number of variables we may encounter when someone is reporting a bug --- i.e. if there are fewer distribution channels there is less maintenance overhead. Nonetheless, as you can see, I've had to make the binary available anyway, because it was the only way some people could easily get the program. Therefore, I think I'll start attaching binaries to releases again. (2) Yes, though this functionality is not part of Salmon itself. I *highly* recommend the [MultiQC](http://multiqc.info/) tool. MultiQC has a salmon module, which will parse all of the salmon log files in an experiment directory and produce a report. This report will contain the mapping percentages for all of the samples extracted from the salmon logs (and will color them nicely). It will also produce other QC information from the salmon runs.

Availability,"Hi @jashapiro,. So there are definitely a few things going on here. The first is that you correctly diagnosed the missing cmd_info.json information when `alevin` is run in RAD mode. That was simply an oversight, and there is no reason that file shouldn't have been written. Second, there is also useful information that belongs in `meta_info.json` in the `aux_info` directory (like the SHA hash of the reference sequences); that was also missing but has now been added.; ; In addition to salmon's `alevin` command, each step of `alevin-fry` also writes some useful metadata when it executes. For example, there is a json file written by the `generate-permit-list` step, one written by the `collate` step, and one written by the `quant` step. We've never run into the problem of the output of `alevin-fry` overwriting the output of `alevin` because we use a directory structure where the output quantifications reside in a separate directory from the input RAD file. However, I can now see that if you're writing the quants in the same place as the input, then there will be a conflict in the file names, and the existing files will be overwritten with the new ones. I agree that both tools output useful information. I'm a *bit* ambivalent about assuming the salmon-generated files exist, and merging them into one output file, as I think there might be cases where those files aren't present and `alevin-fry` should still run properly since it doesn't require them to perform it's processing. One option would be to rename the `alevin-fry` output files to prefix/postfix them so they don't collide with the salmon files even if they live in the same directory. Then, one could (now or later) write a small command to merge the relevant json files into a unified output if that would be more convenient downstream. Let me know your thoughts.

Availability,"Hi @jasonvrogers,. First of all thank you so much for sharing this thorough analysis with us, it was very clear and helpful for understanding the details of the problem you are referring to. Secondly, I apologize for the long time it took me to get back at you. I would like you to know that we have been and are still working on possible solutions for addressing this problem, and here I would like to share some updates with you. . About the success cases, it was nice to know that the current model of Salmon with length correction works pretty well in recovering the right estimates for those ""easier"" cases where one transcript is fully contained in another one. Turning off the length correction, tells the Salmon model not to consider the effective length of each transcript for computing the conditional probabilities of originating a fragment from a transcript. So, for the RNA-seq data there is no reason to turn off this term of the model, and we highly recommend not to use that flag for the bulk RNA-seq abundance estimation with Salmon. Looking more carefully at the 2nd case you have posted as the failure case, it is interesting to see that there is a very nice visual evidence on the super transcript that the long transcript might not be expressed at all. I am referring to the zero coverage regions on the Super Transcript between the regions corresponding to the smaller transcripts, e. g., between POF1 and EMC1. So, we tried a solution that inspects the coverage profile of all transcripts and calculates the probability of observing a zero coverage region on each transcript. If this probability is too low, this would be counted as an evidence for a transcript not being expressed at all. This approach seems to be working fine on this example that you have shared here. however, one problem was that there were considerable number of reads in the sample that were uniquely mapping only to the Super Transcript and turning of the expression of that transcript would result in t",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/514#issuecomment-666512703:556,recover,recovering,556,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/514#issuecomment-666512703,2,['recover'],['recovering']

Availability,"Hi @jeremymsimon — @Gaura is going to take a look at unfiltered permit listing and will share those results here later. Regarding frameshift errors, I think that's certainly out of scope for the alevin -> fry phase, but that type of thing *could* be in scope for `splitp`. Basically, my logic / reasoning is this: I'd like to avoid further complicating the already immense salmon/alevin codebase with special implementations handling problems outside of their core function (e.g. mapping reads to the reference efficiently and quantifying UMIs/barcode). Since most protocols (and the most common) have quite simple barcode geometry, it makes sense for this code to live there. I'm fully supportive of enabling support for more complex barcode geometries and preprocessing requirements if there are folks whom it would help, but it feels like that essential complexity belongs upstream of alevin / fry, so that by the time the reads get to alevin, it can assume a straightforward geometry. So TLDR : I think we'd be willing to investigate what is required to address potential frameshift errors, and how much of a difference that makes, but I think that analysis and eventual implementation (if we decide it's worth it), belongs in `splitp`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-988030837:141,error,errors,141,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-988030837,4,['error'],['errors']

Availability,"Hi @jeremymsimon,. A few quick thoughts on this.; ; > -Is quantification via alevin-fry (rather than alevin itself) mandatory here? I ask since your run seems successful whereas my full alevin run had a very poor BC detection and mapping rate.; ; I don't think we've been able to successfully obtain the same concordance with alevin yet (as opposed to alevin-fry). There is more sophisticated _internal_ barcode logic going on there, and we may need to pull @k3yavi in to see what is happening outside of the RAD -> fry pipeline.; ; > -I see you specified -l A - can you comment on what the detected/correct library type was here?; ; Unlike `alevin`, when you run with in `--rad` or `--sketch` mode, the library type isn't really relevant. All mappings are passed through to the rad file. Subsequently, in `alevin-fry` there is a `-d` (direction) flag that is used to filter mappings that don't concord with the expected orientation. I'm not sure what @Gaura used in the run above — the default is to keep reads from either orientation.; ; > -I assume all of this will also work in conjunction with --expectCells or --keepCBFraction if those parameters were needed? Your ~7k cells detected is very close to the published number post-filtering, but no similar filtering has been done here yet. My guess is that the proportion of cells that pass these filters will be higher for alevin, but we may still be under-estimating the number of real cells by a little bit here.; ; According to the commands listed, @Gaura used `alevin-fry`'s built-in knee-like filtering. This tries to use a knee on the cumulative read count histogram to determine a good cutoff for ""reliable"" cells versus poor quality cells. Alternatively, one can provide an external permit list with `-u` (unfiltered permit list) to quantify all cells that match any known barcode.

Availability,"Hi @jeremymsimon,. I've discussed the support for SPLiT-seq/ParseBio with @Gaura in some depth. Honestly, I think the cleanest solution right now is just to have a more streamlined (and streaming) way to match / replace the random hexamers upstream of alevin-fry. By my understanding, if we can simply replace barcode 1 appropriately (as your Perl script currently does), everything should work downstream in alevin/alevin-fry.; ; To that end, I've thrown together a small rust program based on your Perl script. Currently that lives [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/splitp). It reads the same basic parameters as the Perl script, and writes its output to stdout so that it can be used with named pipes. For example, something like:; ; ```; <normal salmon command> -1 read_file_1.fq -2 <(splitp --read-file read_file_2.fq --bc-map bcSharing_example.txt --start 79 --end 86 --one-hamming); ```. which will transform the second fastq file and stream the transformed reads out which can then be read by alevin-fry. One important thing to note is that while *alevin* requires the input reads to be a real file (i.e. you can't stream reads in because it does 2 passes), if you are mapping these reads for processing with *alevin-fry* you can use the process substitution trick above. As you hinted, this program works considerably faster than the Perl script. For example, for the first 10,000,000 reads in `SRR6750042`, the Perl script took 2m 48s to transform the reads and `splitp` took ~6s (if the output wasn't being written to a file on disk it took <4s). This should generally be fast enough to not be a speed bottleneck. So, perhaps the next step is to try to help you walk through this approach with a test dataset (and ideally using alevin-fry) to see if things are turning out as expected?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-961598108:395,down,downstream,395,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-961598108,2,['down'],['downstream']
Availability,"Hi @jeremymsimon,. So I'm trying to think about what issues _could_ be reasonably dealt with here. . 1) If the length of the sequence in the BAM header and the sequence provided in the FASTA file are different, this seems like a very difficult error to recover from since records can then contain alignments to bases about which we don't know. 2) If the same transcript appears multiple times in the input BAM header, but with different lengths, this also seems a difficult situation to allow. Exact duplicates are one thing, but I'm not sure if sequences ever appear with the same name but different lengths. If so, I'm thinking this would be a hard error. So, I think at least one situation we could reasonably deal with is that the input FASTA file contains multiple entries with the same name (and same length / sequence). In this case, we could retain only one of them, and document / log the fact that multiple identical entries were present in the input. Of course, there would still be an issue if we had a mismatch as with your example STAR input, where STAR concatenated all 3 occurences of an identical transcript.

Availability,"Hi @joshstolz,. Is there a reason you want to restrict the possible mapping to this set of 1800 transcripts? In general, mapping to a small subset of the reference is not ideal, because alignment works based on asking if the ""best hit"" for a read is good enough, so its easy to come up with scenarios where the is a read that matches some transcript very well, and another transcript ""alright"" --- if the transcript it matches very well is in the reference, then it will map there, otherwise it will likely map to the transcript where the match is just ""alright"". TLDR; the set of references included can affect the mappings. That being said, if there is a good technical reason you have for only including a subset of transcripts, that's easy to do. You just build your index on only those transcripts. Salmon treats the reference sequences you feed to it as the ""transcriptome"" and will map to that. Also, you could map to the full transcriptome and just extract the rows for these targets from the `quant.sf` files at the end.

Availability,"Hi @k3yavi , thank you for the reply. Yes, you are right, it seems the problem is indeed in the whitelist `known_cb.txt`. However, I cannot seem to find out what exactly is going on with the file. When I wrote a python script to check the length of each cell barcode in `known_cb.txt`, _all_ of them are 16 bp long. This is the python script:. ```; $ cat print_length.py; with open('known_cb.txt') as fh:; for i in fh:; print(len(i)); ```. since each line has 16 bp barcode and a `\n` character, it outputs 17, which is expected. However, when I used `awk` to check the length, I expected `awk` to output 16, but it actually output 17:. ```; $ awk '{print length($0);}' known_cb.txt | head -2; 17; 17; ```. There might be some hidden characters that I missed. Any idea what's going?. Now, I have cleaned the `known_cb.txt`, and `alevin` runs without problem. For combinatorial indexing, good to known that it will be supported in future. I guess depending on assays, it needs to be a bit more flexible than the current options. The current options have only `--chromium` and `--dropseq` available. However, there are a few different combinatorial indexing assays. For `sci-RNA-seq`, the cell barcodes are within `I1.fastq`, `I2.fastq` and `R1.fastq`. Only `R2.fastq` is useful for gene quantification. For `sci-ATAC-seq`, the cell barcodes (this is just my educational guess) are within `I1.fastq` and `I2.fastq`, and both `R1.fastq` and `R2.fastq` contain useful information from the genome. For other plate-based method, there will be well barcodes and plate barcodes, which could be located in any of those 4 fastq files depends on the design. The cell barcodes will be a combination of well barcodes and plate barcodes. Thank you very much for the help.

The first entry on each row is the number of transcripts in the EC. This is followed by the transcripts (more correctly, indices you can use to obtain the transcripts). Then you have the number of reads with in the EC, followed by the number of barcodes (~cells). For each barcode, you have an index that can be used to retrieve the identity of the barcode, followed by the number of UMIs within that barcode, the sequence of the UMI and lastly the number of reads associated with that UMI. . My goal is create a expression matrix where the ECs are the rows and the columns are the cells.

Since most tagged-end protocols sequence information from only the 3' end of the transcripts, there is a highly-biased coverage signal, and discerning UMI assignment at the transcript level is usually not possible. Therefore, I wouldn't generally recommend trying to obtain transcript-level counts from alevin and we haven't tested it in this context. If you have a particular reason you want to look at transcript counts and believe it may be reasonable in your specific use-case, you can alway pass in a gene-to-transcript map that just maps each transcript to itself, which will result in a transcript-level output matrix. However, I anticipate that the resolution problem will become more difficult in this case, and there will be much more uncertainty in the assignments. @k3yavi, please feel free to add anything you think I may have missed. --Rob",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/588#issuecomment-729974232:171,reliab,reliable,171,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/588#issuecomment-729974232,1,['reliab'],['reliable']

Since the reads may not all be of the same size (perhaps the user has quality-trimmed the reads first and not opted to discard the short ones), it's possible we may see some reads too short to consider, but others would not be. We could choose arbitrary cutoffs (warning if greater than 1,000 such reads and an error if greater than 1,000,000), but this will, of course, depend on how large the input data set is.

Availability,"Hi @klaas-men,. Thanks for the question and for the detailed report! This is an interesting observation. The most likely reason you are seeing this behavior is that the fast mapping algorithms are, in a sense, quite greedy in how they attempt to map reads. This can lead them to suffer with compared to more traditional alignment algorithms like Bowtie2 and BWA-MEM with respect to both sensitivity and specificity. Here, you are likely seeing a manifestation of the former. Specifically, greedy behavior can lead to spurious matches. Many of these spurious matches are filtered out when applying a consensus mechanism to the series of matches produced by a read; however, this can result in the read going unmapped. We have noticed this behavior where spurious matches can ""mask"" better overall mappings, and we have developed an algorithm to overcome these limitations (called selective-alignment). This is currently implemented in [this branch](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/rescue-orphan) of the Salmon repo (if you want to test it out and have trouble building, we can build you a linux executable). This algorithm explores more potential mappings and then applies a fast algorithm for filtering potentially poor ones. In our benchmarks, it exhibits sensitivity and specificity very close to Bowtie2 (which is among the best of the alignment-based methods we considered). Also, I will note that, though the speed and statistical optimization procedures used in fast transcript abundance estimation tools make them a potentially desirable choice for microbiomic / metagenomic abundance estimation, their indices are typically optimized for speed and not size. For small numbers of bacterial species this can be okay, but if one wishes to index large collections of species, the memory usage can become a problem. To this end, we have developed a new indexing scheme (software [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish), slightly out-of-date pre-print [here](https://www.biorxiv",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/196#issuecomment-365337297:775,mask,mask,775,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/196#issuecomment-365337297,1,['mask'],['mask']

Availability,"Hi @kvittingseerup,. No need to apologize, I think it was I who was not clear. What I am saying is that this is *already* the way that Salmon handles such a case. That is, if you have a paired-end read, and one of the reads maps but the other doesn't (due to e.g., adapter contamination or just very low quality), then Salmon will consider the remaining (mapping) end of the read as representative of an entire fragment, and will resolve the fragment origin accordingly during optimization. Generally, not having both ends of a paired-end read leads to increased ambiguity, but this isn't a particularly big problem if it only happens to a generally small fraction of the reads. Further, since you cannot reliably infer the implied fragment length on a transcript from only a single-end read, such mappings will not contribute to the bias model. Again, however, as long as this doesn't happen to the vast majority of fragments, it should have only a negligible effect on quantification and bias correction. Please let me know if this description makes sense.

Availability,"Hi @kvittingseerup,. Sorry for letting this sit for so long without responding. Currently, Salmon does not support mixed paired-end and single-end library types, so this is presumably what is causing the error (granted, the error message here could be considerably better). Practically, I'd be curious what the difference is between allowing this and simply running Salmon with the _non-quality-trimmed_ paired-end reads. Specifically, if Salmon is not able to map a pair concordantly, but it can map one of the ends of the read, then it will already do so. . However, in the case that there's a really compelling reason to want to quality trim the reads prior to quantification (and to include the reads such that the mate has been completely quality-trimmed away), we would be able to support this. It will require a bit of modification to allow different library types to be processed back to back and to contribute to the same quantification estimates. In this case, I imagine what we would want to do for the orphans is essentially what Salmon would do internally if it can't map the mate. That is, we would learn essentially all of the parameters and biases from the pairs that do map concordantly, and then just include the orphaned reads as indicating an entire fragment but of unknown length. Let me know if you have any thoughts about the above, and sorry again for the delay!. --Rob",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/150#issuecomment-353196630:204,error,error,204,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/150#issuecomment-353196630,4,['error'],['error']
Availability,"Hi @lijing28101,. Thanks for your interest in salmon. The answer to your first question:. > I want to know how did you estimate the final counts to combine the unique and ambiguous counts?. is actually a huge part of the method behind salmon. Salmon uses a statistical estimation procedure to determine what abundances for the transcripts are most likely given the observed data (read alignments). You can read about the method in detail [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5600148/pdf/nihms849351.pdf) and about some subsequent improvements [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5870700/) and [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v2). > For the unstranded library, did you use the same algorithm to estimate the final counts as the stranded library? . The difference between stranded and unstranded is that in the stranded library, we set the conditional probability of alignments that don't agree with the specified strandedness to be a very-low, user-adjustable value (`--incompatPrior` : 0 by default). The underlying inference methodology is identical. Strand specificity, if the library was sequenced that way, provides extra signal to the quantification algorithm. However, that is an external source of information, and is only available if the library itself was strand-specific.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/492#issuecomment-620232036:1282,avail,available,1282,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/492#issuecomment-620232036,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"Hi @mishaprochazka and @jdidion,. Thanks @jdidion for pinging me on this. Somehow, Gmail has decided that all GitHub notifications (except those that explicitly tag me, but somehow I missed this one) should go to SPAM. So, I've been missing some of the newer issues here. The short answer is that the documentation needs to be updated. When salmon was originally published, we made use of [RapMap](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/RapMap) as the underlying mapper, which performed quasi-mapping against an index that consisted of a suffix array and a hash over k-mers pointing to prefixes in the suffix array (similar to the strategy used by STAR, but using much longer k-mers to improve lookup speed). We referred to this index as the quasi-index. As the software evolved and we continued to improve the mapping methodology, we eventually transitioned over to an index based on [our pufferfish data structure](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish). In addition to the new data structure, this coincided with our move over to selective-alignment as the mapping algorithm, and all of this happened at the 1.0.0 release (this is why, for example, indices built before 1.0.0 are not compatible with salmon > 1.0.0; a topic on which there have been a few GitHub issues). However, given the fact that the documentation and software are linked only through manual human intervention (we haven't leveled up to e.g. having salmon be a [literate program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) yet), these two sometimes get out of sync. This is an instance of that. We have maintained the functionality of the `--writeMappings` feature, and in fact, even augmented it. However, we have not replaced the antiquated `quasi-index` terminology in the documentation. The TLDR is that you can use `--writeMappings` with the index you built with the `salmon index` command, and it should work fine. If you are mapping against an index without decoy sequences, then the output format will be basically ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/727#issuecomment-996192524:54,ping,pinging,54,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/727#issuecomment-996192524,1,['ping'],['pinging']
Availability,"Hi @mohsenzakeri ,. Sorry for the slow reply! I’ve done some sleuthing and have (seemingly) figured out what’s going on. I compared tons of overlapping transcript scenarios and played with the salmon options and concluded the following:. 1. **Success scenarios:** Generally, with default options, Salmon does an excellent job at assigning reads to overlapping transcripts the same way that a human would. Whether or not the transcripts overlap slightly or one is entirely contained within another is irrelevant. 2. **Failure scenarios:** In some scenarios with overlapping transcripts, read assignment can be very strange and unintuitive, especially when one of the transcript isoforms is much more abundant than the other (the abundant transcript tends to “steal” reads from the less abundant one). 3. Both the success and failure scenarios are **due to the length bias model** used when estimating the abundance of transcripts. **Totally disabling this with the —noLengthCorrection flag** (NOT the —no**Effective**LengthCorrection flag) **actually *creates* the transcript within a transcript failure scenario that I mistakenly thought was the original issue.** That is, when length bias modeling is turned off, then longer transcripts will always get assigned *all* of the reads that multimap to shorter transcripts.; -Therefore... if you *did* want to tackle the transcript within a transcript scenario to build a coverage bias model, you probably want to disable the length bias modeling or at least consider how it would interact with coverage modeling.

Availability,"Hi @mr-c,. First of all, **thank you** for your monumental effort in supporting salmon as a Debian package. I think this is fantastic. I'm also not a CMake expert, but I've failed with it enough times to start to get a handle. I have actually moved to the latest version of Jellyfish (v2.2.3) in the [quasimapping branch](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/quasimapping), which will be merged back into master as soon as we've finished porting the bootstrapping feature from [sailfish-master](https://github.com/kingsfordgroup/sailfish). Regarding supporting external versions of the libraries — this absolutely makes sense. What is the standard location where they are assumed to be installed? In this case I can search with a `FindPackage` before I attempt to download them. From the list above, I see two potential problem libraries:; - bwa — We actually use a modified version of bwa that accepts and uses an extra parameter that specifies the suffix array sampling frequency. Specifically, we, by default, use a denser sampling of the suffix array to trade off extra space usage for more speed in lookup. The standard bwa, therefore, probably wouldn't work.; - jellyfish — I actually tried to use jellyfish without obtaining the source and building it early on in development. I ran into an issue where the config.h file generated during compile wasn't installed by Jellyfish, and this caused runtime failures when Salmon was running. It seems to me that either (1) config.h should be installed with jellyfish by default or (2) it shouldn't be necessary to use jellyfish as a library. However, as far as I know, this issue persists in the latest version of jellyfish (if you want to use it as a library as we do, and not just as a k-mer counter).

Availability,"Hi @pinin4fjords ,. That's a really nice suggestion.

Availability,"Hi @pinin4fjords ,; The error is very subtle, It happens when the total number of genes are exactly a multiple of 8, which in your case it is. It'd be great that before moving forward, if you can quickly verify if 0.99 actually fixes the issue or is it something else. Unfortunately, there is a chance that the `mtx` format output is corrupted for the last 8 genes (in the order they present in the quants_mat_cols.txt), however, the baseline output of alevin `quants_mat.gz` would still be correct and already be in the output folder of your pipeline. The EDS repo I forwarded you just convert the binary output into mtx format correctly. Due to these subtle issues making into production environment, we changed the release cycle to be like a beta to stable type. Currently 0.99 is a beta release, which has been out for some time.

Availability,"Hi @pophipi ,; We are in process of documenting the details of these files generated by using flag `--dumpFeatures`.; However, for your use case of getting alignment rate, there are two ways to get it in Alevin system. First you have to run Aleivn with the flag `--dumpFeatures` but since you have the file `filtered_cb_frequency.txt` I think you already have specified this flag in your run of the dataset. The relevant files you need for generating alignment rate would be following:. 1. *filtered_cb_frequency.txt*: A *tsv* file with the first column as the Cellular Barcode(CB) id and the second column has the frequency of the CB after sequence correction.; 2. *MappedUmi.txt*: A *tsv* file with the first column as the Cellular Barcode(CB) id and the second column has the number of reads confidently mapped to the provided reference transcriptome. Both the file should have same number of rows (i.e. CB), although the order can be different. To get the Alignment rate you might have to divide the value of each CB in the second file by the value in the first file i.e. the Number of mapped reads over total number of available reads for that CB. The second and more easier way is (although version bounded i.e. if you have latest version of Salmon (v11.2)), then if you run alevin with `--dumpFeatures` flag it will also generate a file called `featureDump.txt`. This file has multiple feature entries although the relevant one (the alignment rate) in case of yours would be the first one. Hope that helps.

Availability,"Hi @qifei9,. Thanks for the question and for pointing out the need for update in the docs. Regarding your first question, both approaches (3) and (2) seem reasonable to me. I would *not* try approach (1) as this will eliminate the benefit of the stranded library for the targets where you do know the orientation. For approach (2) , I'd either use `--validateMappings` or at least set `--rangeFactorizationBins 4` (the former implies the latter). As for what value to set for `--incompatPrior`, the effect should be reasonably robust across a range of values, the question is how unlikely _a priori_ would you expect a mapping not in `ISR` orientation to be if you also observed a mapping in `ISR` ... probably very unlikely (you could try e.g. 1e-10 or some such). Approach 3 is also also reasonable, though what you might consider doing is looking at the abundances for these opposite strands of the same sequence post quantification --- you should generally see that one of the two has a non-zero expression, or at least one orientation should have a much higher expression than the other (for expressed transcripts, at least, this might give you evidence as to the true strand of origin). Regarding your second point, the changelog is correct. In recent versions of salmon, `--incompatPrior` is 0 by default.

Availability,"Hi @rached-97,. First of all, thank you for the _incredibly-detailed_ report. All of the information you provided made it easy to pull down the data and to test what might be going on. I pulled down the first sample, consisting of `SRR9071838_1.fastq` and `SRR9071838_2.fastq`, which was recognized as `IU` for you. . However, since I didn't have access to the annotation you used or the specific scripts you used to extract the transcriptome reference, I instead quantified directly against [gencode v37](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_37/gencode.v37.transcripts.fa.gz). When I did this, salmon calls the library format type as `ISR`, which is what we would expect. The `lib_format_count.json` is as such:. ```; {; ""read_files"": ""[ SRR9071838_1.fastq.gz, SRR9071838_2.fastq.gz]"",; ""expected_format"": ""ISR"",; ""compatible_fragment_ratio"": 1.0,; ""num_compatible_fragments"": 31944161,; ""num_assigned_fragments"": 31944161,; ""num_frags_with_concordant_consistent_mappings"": 29445487,; ""num_frags_with_inconsistent_or_orphan_mappings"": 2576421,; ""strand_mapping_bias"": 0.000022006283676957945,; ""MSF"": 0,; ""OSF"": 0,; ""ISF"": 648,; ""MSR"": 0,; ""OSR"": 0,; ""ISR"": 29445487,; ""SF"": 1098610,; ""SR"": 1477163,; ""MU"": 0,; ""OU"": 0,; ""IU"": 0,; ""U"": 0; }; ```. As you can see, the strand mapping bias reported is `0.000022006283676957945` (to an insanely higher level of precision than we actually need). This is, of course, drastically different from the value of `0.36810071818291797` that showed up in your table for this sample. While it is true that salmon is quite conservative about calling a library as stranded (i.e. it would rather make the mistake of calling stranded library as unstranded than vice-versa, as the latter would discard reads while the former would not), in this case it looks like the culprit is likely the transcriptome reference being used.

Availability,"Hi @radlinsky,. I've downloaded the read data and am looking into this. In the meantime, I did notice some relevant output from your log. First, when I run with the automatic library type, I get that the most likely library type is `ISF` rather than `ISR`. Second, I note that ~4M fragments are discarded because they produce dovetailing reads. We discard dovetailing reads by default (this was a recent change in default behavior, though it is the same default choice made by e.g. Bowtie2). You can allow these reads to be mapped and quantified by passing salmon the `--allowDovetail` flag during quantification.

That's a very good question. Basically the answer lies in how complicated the UMI graph network is. Experiment with the antibody derived barcodes (ADT) with 20 protein panel, generally, doesn't need the `--naiveEqclass` mode UMI deduplication, unless the experiment is super deeply sequenced. However, for super low diversity like 4-8 barcodes e.g. for HTO like sample barcodes, the graphical network becomes exponentially hard to solve and significantly increases the running time for alevin. . In general, I'd recommend if you expect very low diversity in the number of barcodes in your experiment, use `--naiveEqclass` otherwise prefer avoiding it. Generally, the experiment with low diversity barcodes results in such a highly dense count matrix that a few error in UMI deduplication won't matter and you can tradeoff extra long running time with reasonable under/over UMI deduplicated counts. . _In short_, 64 guide sequences are relatively high diversity and I'd advise skipping `--naiveEqclass` in your command line argument.

Availability,"Hi @rob-p ,. Yes that's one aspect. But also, Salmon uses CIGAR to evaluate alignment probability in alignment quantification mode no?. And with just RapMap output you would lose other information that Salmon uses to determine likely fragment assignment?. With UMI's you can deduplicate fragments _before_ inferring where they were likely to come from. Ideally you would deduplicate the reads directly based on UMI, then you wouldn't have to think about PCR duplication in the quantification. But of course keeping a hash of all reads in a FASTQ and accounting for dequencing errors wouldn't be really tractable..",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/108#issuecomment-268994712:576,error,errors,576,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/108#issuecomment-268994712,1,['error'],['errors']

Availability,Hi @rob-p . Thanks for the elaborate answer - makes a lot of sense. The problem is that adapter contamination typically occures because the fragments were smaller than the sequence length we sequence into the adapters - and it can occur for a larger fraction of the reads (I've seen up to 50% of reads affected in the 3'end) making it non-negligible. That is why I suggested the extension in the first place. I think it makes a lot of sense to trim adapters away - both because they reduce the number of compatible reads - mostly because the failure to do so will result in an overestimation of the fragment length. . Now that I think about it I don't think we should trim reads based on quality as that will lead to an underestimation of the read length - or what do you think?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/150#issuecomment-355909325:542,failure,failure,542,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/150#issuecomment-355909325,1,['failure'],['failure']

Availability,"Hi @rob-p,. I was finally able to grab some time to try running the beta version you linked (see attached logs). This certainly helped, although I'm still nowhere near a time-frame of ~30min. Here are my results:. The 31-mer running took a bit over an hour and consumed ~17GB of memory. This is about half the running time as the previous version, but approx. the same amount of memory requirement (more on that below). The 17-mer running, took 4.5hrs to complete and consumed ~64GB of memory. This particular running is again, about twice as fast, although the time really depends on the memory limitations I gave it. Since it appears that this version no longer crashes when given less than about 250GB of memory, I also tested with 32G and 16GB of memory, just to see what impact this would have on the times. Those jobs are still running (it's only been about 4hrs as of this writing, I'll update my post if/when they complete).

Thanks for the suggestion, I've now been investigating the potential of an index-related issue. Firstly, I downloaded the pre-built salmon index from refgenie using `refgenie pull hg38/salmon_sa_index`. I then ran `salmon quant` using this index and the singularity image of salmon v1.9.0. What, would you know: it worked in about 11 minutes. ```; <truncated>; [2023-02-23 14:46:31.892] [jointLog] [info] Aggregating expressions to gene level; [2023-02-23 14:46:32.452] [jointLog] [info] done; ```. This pre-built index does appear to be decoy-aware:. ```; [2023-02-23 14:38:21.709] [jointLog] [info] Number of decoys : 195; [2023-02-23 14:38:21.709] [jointLog] [info] First decoy index : 177412 ; ```. Secondly, I created a new transcriptome-only salmon index (`singularity run -B /data $SALMON_SIMG salmon index -t genome.transcripts.fa -i salmon_index -k 31`), then ran `salmon quant` again (as above) but using the new transcriptome-only index. Note: 'genome.transcripts.fa' is the transcripts file created during the `nf-core/rnaseq` pipeline. Again, this analysis completed properly in a reasonable time. Seems like there is something very wrong with the 'gentrome.fa' file that's being created by `nf-core/rnaseq`! It's just so odd that _some_ samples would work and others wouldn't. 2. It's definitely worth noting that I originally opted against using `star_salmon` with the following command:. ```; nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq --max_memory 55.GB --fasta /data/reference_genomes/GRCh38/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna_sm.primary_assembly.fa.gz --gtf /data/reference_genomes/GRCh38/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.106.gtf.gz -",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/830#issuecomment-1441194948:494,down,downloaded,494,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/830#issuecomment-1441194948,1,['down'],['downloaded']

Availability,"Hi @rudondamba,. Thanks for the report. At salmon v1.0.0, there was a breaking change in the index used in salmon. We moved from using the RapMap index to using a [pufferfish based index](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish). This means that, you'll want to rebuild your index using a recent version of salmon. Further, the move to the pufferfish index drops support for the FMD-like index, so you can remove the `--type` argument. With a new version of salmon you should be able to do:. ```{bash}; salmon index -t galGal6.gene+cluster+repBase+tRNA.fa -i SalmonIndex -k 31 -p 8; ```. the `-p` is optional and tells salmon to use 8 threads during indexing. Also, the default `k` is 31, so you don't need to pass that explicitly if don't want. Best,; Rob. P.S. It's worth noting that, even after this, there is still one small problem with your FASTA input file. You have an empty sequence name on line `30445`. More specifically, you have a record named `> NM_001318772.1_Unfound_-`. Note the space between the `>` and the record name. This is not allowed, and leads to an error in parsing the file.

Availability,"Hi @s1corley . As @rob-p mentions, your paper could help assess different methodologies for quantification and also help optimize salmon further for QuantSeq.

One way I checked these with my datasets was to run the salmon quant command 3 times - once with `libType A`, once with` libType SF` and once with `libType SR` -- with QuantSeq FWD the estimated counts will be almost same with libType A and libType SF.

Availability,"Hi @shanmugavadivelps,. This is because, to properly find and link libiconv, the build requires a version of CMake that ships with FindIConv.cmake.

Availability,"Hi @shnmunk,. Yes, the `--noLengthCorrection` flag is recommended for nanopore based quantification. We expect (and generally observe) that there is not a fragmentation effect in ONT data. Therefore, it is recommended that you use the `--noLengthCorrection` flag with ONT data. You are correct that this make the setting of `--fldMean` and `--fldSD` irrelevant, since there is no length effect applied during the EM algorithm. The other point of note is that selective-alignment is not really designed for long reads, so folks typically use salmon with external alignment for quantifying long-read data (minimap2 is a popular choice). Currently, it's necessary to turn off the read error model `--noErrorModel` when processing long-read alignments, as the long read error profiles are very different form those of short reads. However, this is a temporary issue, as a long-read error model has been developed and is in the pipeline. For the time being though, `--noErrorModel --noLengthCorrection` is the relevant set of flags to get the best results with long-read RNA-seq (either cDNA or direct RNA).

Availability,"Hi @silvernano,. Though alignment stringency parameters can have an effect here, the problem of comparing the abundance of a specific transcript within the context of different annotations is more fundamental. That is, apart from the transcript of interest, the ""background"" of related transcripts may be different. Consider the following case:. You have an annotation with 2 transcripts annotated for your gene:. ```; [A, B, C]; [A,C]; ```. Where `A`, `B`, and `C` are exons and the `[A,B,C]` notation means the transcript is exon `A`, followed by `B`, followed by `C`. Now, imagine that in annotation 2, you just have:. ```; [A,C]; ```. That is, the other isoform `[A, B, C]` is missing from annotation 2. Now, imagine that, in reality, `[A,B,C]` is highly expressed in your sample and `[A,C]` is lowly expressed. Under annotation 1, you get (correct) high expression for `[A,B,C]` and low expression for `[A,C]`. However, in annotation 2, since you still have to describe the `A` reads and the `C` reads, you get high expression for `[A,C]` since the reads contained within `A` and within `C` still map well there — the reads that map to `B` and to the `A-B` and `B-C` junction will likely just go un-mapped (which explains a difference in mapping rate). Now if you compare `[A,C]` across databases ... you will see big differences. This is not really related to the alignments that are observed, but rather how the data (reads) must be explained conditioned on the transcriptome (annotation) you have available. In other words, in loci with substantial unannotated transcription, the annotation used can definitely have a considerable effect on the quantification results. How to best assess, detect, and mitigate these effects is an active area of research, but I can point you at papers like [this](https://www.life-science-alliance.org/content/2/1/e201800175) and [this](https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/pdfExtended/S2405-4712(19)30381-3).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/525#issuecomment-639057440:1505,avail,available,1505,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/525#issuecomment-639057440,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"Hi @sjackman , Thanks for you question. It is indeed a good observation to use salmon for combining separate CB and read-sequence fastq files.; Having said that, we have designed alevin to work with, and tested it on 10x-chromium `cellranger` pipeline which itself has a feature similar to mentioned above by you (enabled by flag `--dumpfq`). This feature takes in two separate files: one with CB+UMI and another with read-sequence, and performs initial whitelisting (knee based , more intelligent whitelisting happens downstream and needs deduplicated UMI counts or one can just optionally provide external whitelist), error corrects the CB, attaches it to the header (although not with tag `BX:Z`) of the read-sequence in the second file, and dumps it to the standard out. I might have to read a bit about `longranger` and its `FASTQ` format, but if you are familiar with the `longranger` pipeline and are sure that it uses 16+10 (CB+UMI) in one file and read-sequence in the second file, then I think you are good to try alevin with `--dumpfq` flag.

The implementation of SA is, as Avi mentions, part of the mainline salmon code now (in the develop and master branch). We link, in the README, to some pre-constructed decoy-aware transcriptomes, but you can build your own for any organism where you have the transcriptome, the genome, and an annotation, using the script Avi linked to. There are a few ways to enable selective alignment, and the details are listed with the relevant flags in the release notes (we will be updating the documentation shortly with more detailed examples as well). Specifically, you can pass salmon the `—validateMappings` flag, which turns on selective alignment with some reasonable default parameters. You can, instead, pass the flag `—mimicBT2`, which is a meta-flag that enables selective alignment, and turns on a few other things that make the alignments more similar to the Bowtie2 parameters we discuss in the paper (e.g. it disallows orphan alignments). Finally, there is the `—mimicStrictBT2` flag, which mimics Bowtie2 parameters that disallow indels; however, we generally don’t recommend this flag unless you have a particular reason for using it. For any of these, once you’ve built a decoy-aware index, you need not do anything else special during quantification.

Availability,"Hi @tillea and @nileshpatra,. Ok, I dug deeper and found out what's going on. The culprit is, in fact, `libcereal`. The problem is that `libcereal` bumped patch versions only since the version corresponding to the headers included in `pufferfish`, but their changes are not, in fact, backwards compatible! This lead to a version mismatch between the headers used in `pufferfish` and the headers found from the installed package, ultimately resulting in an assertion failure in `rapidjson` (which cereal is using) and a segfault. On the plus side, this was relatively easy to fix by bumping the included cereal headers in pufferfish. I also updated the `Findcereal.cmake` module and added a version constraint so that we now require the new version (1.3.2). This is now tagged and released as `salmon 1.10.1`. Please give that a go when you have a chance. I'll note that, before this is added upstream in debian, I'd still advocate for fixing the `libstaden` package to update to the new version. I'd also recommend moving to dependencies like the ones I've included above to remove some really antiquated dependencies that salmon no longer requires but are still being pulled in.

Availability,"Hi @tillea,. It seems this is exactly the problem. The build deps here are not quite correct. There are dependencies that salmon no longer has, and some of the dependencies it does have are out of date and can't be used from upstream (e.g. libstaden in the latest version, among others). On the bright side, it's not the dynamic linking alone that is problematic. The following works fine on my end:. ```{bash}; $ docker pull debian:testing; $ docker run -it debian:testing; $ echo ""deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian unstable main"" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/10-debsrc.list; $ apt-get update; $ apt-get upgrade; $ apt-get install build-essential git libboost-all-dev liblzma-dev libbz2-dev cmake zlib1g-dev curl unzip wget libcurl4-openssl-dev libtbb-dev libtbb12 liblzma-dev libjemalloc2 pkg-config libgff-dev; $ wget https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/archive/refs/tags/v1.10.0.tar.gz; $ tar xaf v1.10.0.tar.gz; $ cd salmon-1.10.0; $ mkdir build && cd build; $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_SHARED_LIBS=TRUE -DBZIP2_LIBRARIES=-lbz2 -DBZIP2_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include -DLIBLZMA_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/ -DLIBLZMA_LIBRARY=lzma -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=/usr/share/cmake/Modules -DTBB_WILL_RECONFIGURE=FALSE -DBOOST_WILL_RECONFIGURE=FALSE ..; $ make -j8; $ make install; $ make test; ```. This is preferring dynamic linking, and the resulting installed executable runs fine without a segfault. Can you try this on your end?

Availability,"Hi @tillea,. So I went through the list of deps pulled in by `apt build-dep salmon` and the minimal set I gave above. I tried to make the smallest number of changes I could to the `apt build-dep salmon` list while also removing things that are clearly outdated (we no longer use jellyfish, rapmap, etc. and we use the header-only version of spdlog). As a result I came up with this list of dependencies. The offending dependency seems to be `libcereal-dev`. Specifically, I was able to install just this list of dependencies (minus `libcereal-dev`) atop a clean `debian:testing` and get a working version where the only thing downloaded from the internet was the appropriate version of the pufferfish files grabbed by `fetchPufferfish.sh` in the `1.10.0` release. Once I installed `libcereal-dev` with `apt-get install`, and rebuilt, then I got the segfault mentioned at the top of this issue. So, it seems that we either have to let `salmon` build it's own libcereal, or figure out what the problem is with the library upstream. Please let me know if this you observe this same behavior as well (also @nileshpatra may want to try this out). If so, perhaps we can get `libstaden` updated upstream, and then use this as the new dep list for `salmon`.

Both `--seqBias` and `--gcBias` are relatively new features, and have definitely undergone more testing under the ""quasi-mapping"" codepath than the alignment-based codepath (though it's passed our internal regression tests on both). That being said, bias correction is equally valid regardless of whether you're using quasi-mapping or quantifying from a bam file directly. I'd be happy to take a look if you can provide a small example (a subset of the reads in the bam file?) that triggers the behavior. One thought might be that, for some reason, positions in the bam file could disagree with what's provided in the corresponding fasta.

Availability,"Hi @vertesy ,. Thanks for asking the very interesting question.; I'd say the answer might depend on what's your downstream use case. Traditionally, no quantification pipeline, in my knowledge, has used the pre-mRNA counts alone to bump up the gene counts, however, recent method of estimating RNA-velocity does utilizes the intronic counts for extracting the ratio of spliced/unspliced counts. If you are interested in disjoint signals (gene count matrix) for spliced and unspliced molecules you can use the recent scheme of decoy indexing from our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v2). We (mostly @csoneson) have been testing alevin with following scheme for generating spliced and unspliced counts. 1.) Spliced Counts: Index transcriptome w/ pre-mRNA sequence as the decoys.; 2) Unspliced Counts: Index pre-mRNA sequence w/ transcriptome as the decoys. The third case is a little tricky because if you index both pre-mRNA and transcriptome, due to relatively longer length of pre-mRNA sequence compared to transcripts it might end-up biasing the UMI deduplication algorithm towards unspliced counts. To summarize, the best way to have an additive spliced and unspliced counts is still an open area of research.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/450#issuecomment-555136444:112,down,downstream,112,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/450#issuecomment-555136444,1,['down'],['downstream']

Availability,"Hi @warrenmcg,. Thanks for this bug report. This error is caused by the `--useVBOpt` argument. The telltale sign that this is the cause is that the exception contains the text `Exception : [Error in function boost::math::digamma<long double>(long double): Evaluation of function at pole -nan]; salmon quant was invoked improperly.` The digamma function is used only in the `useVBOpt` codepath. . I can say that this behavior is never expected (i.e. it's not the case that due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm we sometimes expect to evaluate the digamma function on an argument of `-nan`). Actually, even if one could set a randomization seed, he could not make salmon purely deterministic unless it was restricted to a single thread. This is because the order in which reads are observed during the online phase of the algorithm can change, as a result of the multithreaded read parser (which is _ok_ since the absolute order of the reads in the file is, itself, random). What I suspect is that there is some corner case here where the argument to the `digamma` function should be checked for validity before the `digamma` function is called. The key, of course, is to find a small example that will reproduce this behavior so that the bug can be tracked down and fixed. In the meantime, my recommendation would be to remove the `--useVBOpt` option to Salmon.

Availability,"Hi @yeodynasty,. There are two different ways to tackle this question. The first relies on the fact that the correction employed by salmon for GC bias is done via the adjustment of transcript effective lengths. Here, you could compare the effective length in the quant.sf file to the effective length you would get ignoring GC-fragment (or other bias). Granted, the latter is not written down in the file here, but it is straightforward to calculate since salmon also writes out the fragment length distribution. ; The effective length discarding bias estimates is simply the transcript length, minus the mean of the conditional fragment length distribution (the fragment length distribution from 0 up to the transcript length, re-normalized to be an appropriate probability distribution). If you look at the differences between these values, you can infer how much bias correction was applied. Specifically, when the bias-corrected length is longer than the non bias-corrected length, then these transcripts are over-represented in sequencing and the bias correction aims to reduce their estimated abundance. On the other hand, when the bias-corrected length is shorter than the non bias-corrected length, then these transcripts are under-represented in sequencing and the bias correction aims to increase their estimated abundance.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/578#issuecomment-717267531:388,down,down,388,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/578#issuecomment-717267531,2,['down'],['down']

Availability,"Hi Andrea,. The bias correction time depends on the number of expressed transcripts. There is a flag to speed it up `--biasSpeedSamp`. It takes a value by which to downsample the fragment length pmf for bias modeling. The larger this number, the faster bias correction will become. The default is 1, and is super conservative (we are probably going to make the default 5 in the next release because it is much faster with no real difference in modeling quality). In fact, values up to at least 10 seem to work quite well with respect to the baseline.

Availability,"Hi Andreas,. So I don't know if there is a easy way to get the specific list of reverse dependencies, but then we can cross-check it with my explicit list above:. ```; build-essential; git ; libboost-all-dev ; liblzma-dev ; libbz2-dev ; cmake ; zlib1g-dev ; curl ; unzip ; wget ; libcurl4-openssl-dev ; libtbb-dev ; libtbb12 ; liblzma-dev ; libjemalloc2 ; pkg-config ; libgff-dev; ```. One thing I noticed during build is that, while I included `libjemalloc2` here, the salmon build procedure still downloaded and built `jemalloc`. However, I don't _think_ jemalloc is the thing causing the segfault. Regarding dependencies that can't be used — the current `libstaden` is behind the upstream release. The upstream release contains an important bug fix for a bug (and suggested fix that we proposed to the developer) upon which we rely. More importantly, afaik there is no relevant `libpufferfish-dev` package (we certainly have not made one), and so there is not even e.g. a check in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Salmon's build always tries to run `fetchPufferfish.sh` to download the relevant `pufferfish` source files needed to build `salmon`. Critically, the relevant `pufferfish` dependencies and `salmon` releases move in lockstep. Each new `salmon` release it accompanied by a new tag in the `pufferfish` repo (so that the specific source used to build a given `salmon` release is fixed and easily trackable). So, I think the easiest way to move forward is to:. * do a diff of my list of packages above with what is pulled in by `apt build-dep salmon`. * figure out why, even when `libjemalloc2` is installed, the build system tries to build `jemalloc` itself (maybe we need the dev package?). * determine what folks want to do upstream about the lockstep pufferfish dependency.

But such filtering may not be expected if interests are also on cells with small transcriptomes such as TILs. I will try some downstream filtering to see how many good cells I can get. .

Availability,"Hi Avi,. Thanks for the detailed reply. I was able to run it (see logs below), but I had to use `ISR`, not `ISF` to get it to work. I also had to add these two settings as well; `--freqThreshold 1 --lowRegionMinNumBarcodes 100`. . I am not sure why the `ISF` option didn't work, but probably it has something to do with the guide sequences I was provided. At any rate, I have a few other questions I hope you can help me answer. 1. Why does increasing --maxNumBarcodes to 200000 results in no barcodes getting corrected? (See log for Run 2 below). What is the rationale for the current default of 100000? ; 2. For the downstream analysis of such data, I usually work with both the read and UMI counts, but `quants_mat.gz` only contains the UMI counts. Can Alevin a produce a matrix of read counts as well. It would be a great feature to add. For now, what is easiest way to get the cell x feature matrix of read counts if I use the ` --dumpEq` or `--dumpBfh` flags? Can *tximport* be used for this or do I need to use the Python [parser]([https://github.com/k3yavi/vpolo/blob/master/vpolo/alevin/parser.pyl]) first?.

Availability,"Hi Brian,. In general, I would argue that one should be cautious with removing PCR duplicates in RNA-seq data (unless you are dealing with reads with UMI tags). This is because reads that align to the same reference position can easily have come from alternative transcripts sharing the same underlying sequence. Hence, the normal tests used to infer PCR duplicates with e.g. DNA-seq reads can yield false-positives in RNA-seq. This is particularly true for highly abundant transcripts (or transcripts from highly-abundant genes). We are currently working on the code that will do duplicate removal when UMI tags are present. That methodology can be extended to remove duplicates even without UMI tags --- though I'd generally caution against that for the reasons mentioned above. However, for the time being, if you have a strong need or desire to filter PCR duplicates, you could use alignment-based Salmon with a BAM file that has duplicates removed. Finally, regarding the error you are getting during SAM validation; this sounds like a different issue. Would you mind providing a piece of that SAM file for me to take a look at? Specifically, I don't believe the quasi-mapping output file should even contain unmapped reads (unless you consider unmapped mates of orphaned reads). --Rob",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/136#issuecomment-305317281:977,error,error,977,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/136#issuecomment-305317281,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"Hi James,. Indeed! No problem. Looking at the older annotation, it seems that the transcripts have slightly different lengths:. ```; >ENST00000617214 ensembl:known chromosome:GRCh38:CHR_HSCHR8_8_CTG1:1973878:2006943:1 gene:ENSG00000273645 gene_biotype:protein_coding transcript_biotype:protein_coding. >ENST00000320248 ensembl_havana_transcript:known chromosome:GRCh38:8:1973878:2006936:1 gene:ENSG00000176595 gene_biotype:protein_coding transcript_biotype:protein_coding; ```. I don't know if that's the _only_ difference between them or if they are spliced differently in the middle etc. Both salmon and seqkit only check for *exact* sequence duplication. If you wanted to try to dig more into what might be causing the differences you might consider `<salmon_quant_folder>/aux_info/ambig_info.tsv` which lists the transcripts in the same order as `quant.sf` but gives for each the number of uniquely mapping reads and the total number of potential reads.

Well, yes and no. We make extensive use of the position when estimate the implied fragment length (distance between paired end reads) and then model the conditional probability of this fragment based on the global fragment length distribution. This is just as much as is done by e.g. RSEM. However, you are right that there is no notion of using the coverage profile in estimation (more on this below)!. > Also, my intuition for these transcripts is not really a coverage ""bias"" . My intuition agrees with yours here completely. First, this isn't really a coverage bias as we use the normal definition of the term. Second, the positional bias modeling in salmon is not on a per-transcript level (since that would be an astronomical number of different parameters to learn, and any procedure would almost certainly overfit). Instead, it groups transcripts into length bins, and learns a distinct coverage bias model per-bin. > It would be neat if Salmon could detect these kinds of dramatic dropoffs and add a warning or something... even if not incorporating the information into the quants... it could even be a good QC step to identify large deletions/insertions over a gene body.

Availability,"Hi Kivanc,. Thanks for the kind words, and thank you for the _extremely detailed_ report. Reports like this are a model of what every developer wishes a user did before filing an issue :). First, let me clear up what seems like might be a small source of confusion. Since both of the salmon runs are from v1.1.0, _neither_ of these are making use of quasi-mapping. Specifically, newer versions of salmon _only_ perform selective alignment (and this makes the `--validateMappings` command line argument redundant in newer versions, though we keep it so as to maximize backward compatibility with command line parameters people may be using). So, the main difference between your two salmon runs is inclusion of the decoy set. This almost certainly means that the reads that map in your second set of salmon runs but not your first are being assigned to decoys in the first case. To try and get a better handle on this, could you upload a `meta_info.json` file from both runs? This file lives in the `aux_info` directory, and it will provide information about e.g. how many reads were best mapped to decoys and were discarded for this reason. The guarantee you get from the selective alignment is that, if the fragment is discarded by decoy mapping, it maps _strictly better_ to the decoy than to the non-decoy sequence. There are many reasons this could happen. One is rRNA contamination, another could be that reads are coming from processed pseudogenes that are not properly in your annotation, yet a third is that your sample has a considerable fraction of reads spanning exon-intron junctions (in this case, the read will map better to the corresponding location on the genome, and worse to the annotate transcript where the intronic sequence is not present). Now, figuring out exactly which of these cases you are in is a bit more difficult, but one approach would be to pick one of the samples with the biggest differences and map to the reads to the genome with e.g. STAR or HISAT2 to see what y",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/479#issuecomment-578848875:502,redundant,redundant,502,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/479#issuecomment-578848875,2,['redundant'],['redundant']
Availability,"Hi Kristoffer,. The duplicate transcript issue is a frustrating one. It came to our attention when we noticed that ensembl often annotated transcripts on patch / haplotype contigs that were identical and unlikely to be different from more ""canonical"" transcripts in any way. Further, these transcripts are indistinguishable from the quantification perspective. That being said, the removal of sequence duplicate transcripts is optional in Salmon. If you pass `--keepDuplicates` to the indexer, it wont remove them. Also, Salmon does record, in the index directory, the ""collapsing map"". Specifically, there is a tsv file that record, for every collapsed transcript, the transcript that was sequence identical and retained in the index. You can use this map to recover the abundances for the collapsed transcripts, since they are all sequence identical, they should all have an abundance of x / num duplicates (where x is the abundance of the retained transcript).

Availability,"Hi Rob!; I think I got it, I might have posted too soon, I was too eager to run the latest Salmon :). Basically, for the first part of my question, if anyone else happens to run into here:; To successfully run Salmon Index 1.0.0+, three inputs are required:; 1. Transriptome FASTA; 2. Concatenated Transcriptome+Genome FASTA; 3. List of decoys (most likely the list of all contigs from the Genome FASTA); So on from version 1.0.0, any supplementary scripts aren't needed (as you properly specified in your latest instructions). . Regarding the second part of my question, the ERCC contigs and the error that Salmon Index gave:; The reason for this was that my ERCC entries look like this:; `ERCC-00002 ERCC exon 1 1061 0.000000 + . gene_id ""ERCC-00002""; transcript_id ""ERCC-00002"";`; i.e. the contig name and the transcript name is identical. ; This means that there will exist an entry in the Transcriptome FASTA file labeled as ERCC-00002, and an entry in the Genome FASTA file labeled as ERCC-00002.; Then, in the concatenated Transcriptome+Genome FASTA, there will first be transcript sequence ERCC-00002, and then a genome sequence ERCC-00002, which is labeled as decoy. ; Hence the error: non-decoy, then some decoys, then again the ERCC-00002 as non-decoy. So my solution here was just to omit the ERCC entries both from the decoy list and from the genome FASTA that gets concatenated to the transcriptome. They're still kept in the transcriptome FASTA, as this allows to look for expression results of these transcripts for downstream absolute normalization.

Availability,"Hi Ryan,. Thanks for your kind words regarding salmon! First, I'll point out that *if it is desired*, you can also use STAR+Salmon in much the same way you've used STAR+RSEM (though STAR+salmon will be faster). To your question, if you want to use salmon's built-in selective-alignment, while choosing a k-mer length for this data, then the general rule of thumb is that the k-mer length should not be much longer than about half of the read length. In general, the alignment procedure and ultimate quantification are pretty robust to the specific choice of k, but you may want to try out a few values for one or two samples. Given these read lengths, I'd probably choose a value in {21, 23, 25}. If you have any follow-up questions after looking at those results, I'd be happy to discuss further!.

Availability,"Hi Ryan,. The difficulty is, indeed, exactly as you specify. Given a single-end read, one does not know the length of the _fragment_ from which it originates. In this case the ""right"" thing to do (the best thing we can do) is to consider the read as starting / ending a fragment of every possible length allowed by the user-provided fragment length distribution (with the contribution of each possible fragment weighted by the probability of observing a fragment of that length). In order to make this computationally feasible, one would have to do some clever pre-computation and thing a bit more about how to efficiently update the observed GC model (right now, each mapping contributes a single weight to the model, but under the naive implementation in the single-end case, each mapping would contribute different weights to each bin of the observed GC-bias curve, which would slow things down considerably). Also, as you point out, the quality of the correction would depend somewhat on the user providing appropriate parameters for the fragment length distribution mean and standard deviation — but this seems reasonable in the single-end case. That being said, I'm sure there's a way to handle this efficiently, I'd just have to think about it a bit. Regarding your second question; Salmon learns the fragment length distribution in paired-end data, but not with single-end data. Single-end data can provide a little bit of information (e.g. there is in upper bound on fragment lengths that one can infer based on single-end reads based on how far they map from the end of the transcript), but not enough information to reliably infer a fragment length distribution. cc @mikelove in case he has any thoughts on this.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/83#issuecomment-243833424:893,down,down,893,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/83#issuecomment-243833424,4,"['down', 'reliab']","['down', 'reliably']"

Availability,"Hi Victor,. Is it the case that `/n/data1/cores/bcbio/ej_rnaseq/tCells_KO/work/spikein/Flox5YFP0_B07_R/index` is an index of only your genes of interest? If so, that would explain what you're seeing. Salmon assumes that some non-zero fraction of reads map in your sample. In this case, I'd presume that if you have some samples where no reads map to any transcript of your gene of interest, then salmon will complain in exactly the manner mentioned above. Now that I think about it, there are actually two different scenarios that can cause the above. The first is if something goes wrong in the optimization (there should be no way for this to happen, and so it would be the result of a bug if it did). The second is actually if there are no mappable reads. That's not the result of a bug, or even an ""error"" per-se, but just very unexpected input (since, in a typical scenario, this would imply the reads are unmatched with the reference). It might make sense to handle this case separately. However, this is certainly what is causing the output in your case, and you can safely assume that here, were it not for this specific check, Salmon would return an estimated count of 0 for all transcripts in the index.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/119#issuecomment-278743839:803,error,error,803,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/119#issuecomment-278743839,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"I am trying to quantify these data at the transcript level which is why the number of features is this big. For the PBMC3k I was trying with a transcript to gene --tgMap but was still seeing the same error. I realized I forgot to update the path to the run.sh script when calling the 0.12.0 binary (I updated the path to the binary but no to the script). When running the wrapper in the 0.12.0 folder I could succesfully run alevin on the CD14 dataset, with or without the --forceCells 4000 flag. I tried to run alevin-0.12.0 on the PBMC 3k dataset but I got the same error. I am now trying to run it on all the FACS-sorted samples and I will see how that goes. I feel this is happening slightly inconsistently (although very frequently). Notably, it either happens after `Clearing EqMap; Might take some time.` or `Starting Import of the gene count matrix of size 5344x167268.`. I have had it happen once in the middle of the `Analyzed xxx cells (yy% of all)` phase.

Availability,"I see, we might have to tweak a bit based on the use case for `longranger basic`.; In `v0.10`, alevin should still be able to do CB correction, and attach the corrected CBs to the header of the second file, although the remaining template sequence (128 bases) from the first file might get loss, since `cellranger` was using template sequencing in only one file. Like @rob-p was saying we can work on making this step more generalized, once we confirm that the error-correction model for `cellranger` and `longranger` can be used interchangeably. In theory we can still concatenate the remaining 128 bases into an interleaved format since alevin has hidden options to provide the lengths explicitly but we have not tested this feature extensively. We will keep this at the top of our feature-request list and would inform you as soon as we have a stable version with this feature. Thanks again for the interest !!. re: *interleaved format* -- indeed an interleave format does makes sense and should be the default dumping format, but I believe since the default mode of 10x's `mkfastq` is to dump separate `FASTQ`, we should not use resources to create an interim interleaved format and then consume it downstream (since`FASTQ` itself is not very efficient), instead, in alevin we just consume the two separate `FASTQ` into our own interim data-structure to perform the downstream analysis.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/233#issuecomment-395195411:461,error,error-correction,461,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/233#issuecomment-395195411,3,"['down', 'error']","['downstream', 'error-correction']"

Usually we try to follow upstream closely (which we failed for salmon blatantly for several reasons - one is the close connection to pufferfish).; Regarding `pufferfish`: We tried hard to get `pufferfish` packaged but failed (due to the use of other versions of `spdlog`, `cereal`, and `fmt`) However, since we can't run `fetchPufferfish.sh` *inside the build process* I was running it separately and added the downloaded source in [debian/external/pufferfish](https://salsa.debian.org/med-team/salmon/-/tree/master/debian/external/pufferfish) So I think the requirement of salmon should be fulfilled. I confirm your feeling that pufferfish is important for the current issue.; However, in the test I did when opening this bug report I did not do that pre-downloading of pufferfish since I was building right in the downloaded source tarball. `libpufferfish-dev` was not installed by `apt build-dep salmon` since this package does not exist.; Kind regards, Andreas.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/835#issuecomment-1464878371:700,down,downloaded,700,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/835#issuecomment-1464878371,6,['down'],"['downloaded', 'downloading']"

For k=1, we had `edit_cost = 8` leading to automatic setting of `minScoreFraction` of 0.797619.; we have looked at 15 length barcodes, but it's possible longer barcodes might have more sequencing error.

Availability,"In my experience it is normal to get a **much lower** transcriptome mapping rate for rRNA-depleted samples vs polyA-selected samples. . I'm getting ~21% mapping rate (using Gencode 41 transcripts) on human brain RNAseq samples sequenced several years ago using rRNA-depletion protocol (older Illumina Ribo Zero kits).; I was initially shocked (being used to seeing >90% mapping rates from HISAT2/STAR for these samples) but it turns out **this is normal** for this kind of samples, in this context.; HISAT2 reports 96% mapping rate on the same samples, but QC metrics (rnaseqc) for these HISAT2 alignments (using the same Gencode annotation) show a **65% intronic rate** and a **%23.5 exonic rate** (the rest being intergenic etc). So the _exonic rate_ is getting close to what Salmon is showing (and what it measures), thus I suppose it makes sense to see such a low mapping rate for Salmon on these samples.; (kallisto also reports ~21% pseudoaligned percentage on the same samples). I am only a bit disappointed that when I use `--validateMappings` with decoy sequences (whole genome) added, the mapping rate goes down to about **16.7%** -- as some reads map better to the decoys in that case (partially intronic reads etc.), but I also see a `higher number of fragments entirely discarded because of alignment score` (higher `num_fragments_filtered_vm` and much higher `num_alignments_below_threshold_for_mapped_fragments_vm`).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/779#issuecomment-1474291747:1117,down,down,1117,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/779#issuecomment-1474291747,1,['down'],['down']

The binary works for me without error (or that strange jemalloc warning) on OS X 10.12.4. The relevant library should be statically linked in, so I doubt it's a path problem.

Availability,"It depends what type of ""replicates"" these are. If these are biological replicates, then they should _definitely_ be run separately. Biological replicates contain crucial information about the variability of expression that can be expected in a given condition, and all downstream differential expression tools will use this information. If these are ""technical"" replicates, then there should be little harm in quantifying them together (of course, then one has a 2 condition experiment with only 1 biological replicate per-condition ... which is a big problem if one wishes to analyze e.g. differential expression).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/190#issuecomment-400080695:270,down,downstream,270,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/190#issuecomment-400080695,1,['down'],['downstream']
Availability,"It is, if you provide a list of CB to use through command line flag --whitelist. But again I think it's a circular problem, if you know the list of CB to use, you might have already figures out the frequency distribution of each CB by parsing the fastq. Either by using --dumpFeatures or externally may be through awk. One other option is to use --keepCBfraction it takes a number in (0, 1] , which basically tells Alevin to use X fraction of CB from the total observed. The caveat there is to figure out a decent value of X as the CB frequency distribution is a long tailed distribution and if say you provide 1 then Alevin will quantify each and every observed CB and slow down the full pipeline.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/362#issuecomment-490833213:675,down,down,675,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/362#issuecomment-490833213,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"MI count **but** I had to bring that part into the discussion as it was mentioned that you wanted to compare different deduplication strategies. I think your suggestion makes sense and mostly aligns with the definition being used by 10x [here](https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003646912-How-is-sequencing-saturation-calculated-). Although note they have changed the definition with the new version of the software. Anyhow, the *short answer* to the question of how can we generate that in Alevin environment is -- by post processing the dumpFeatures output of the Alevin run. _long answer_: The difference lies in the term deduplication and the strategy used to perform it. Basically the fundamental unit for deduplication in 10x as mentioned in the link above is a tuple of `(valid cell-barcode, valid UMI, gene) `, while that's not exactly true for us. We can certainly generate it but it does not aligns with the theory of Alevin's deduplication Algorithm. Having said that, I also like your idea of using:; > the gene quantifications from (de)duplicated UMIs, gene quantifications from unique UMIs, using them to have an idea of the amount/ratio of redundant information. However, the above definition reflect more of the duplication rate (at least in terms of the definition defined in *Alevin* manuscript [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/01/335000)) than sequence saturation. **NOTE** the quoted definition was actually the 10x definition of sequence saturation too before it was changed, at least in my understanding. If you need the deduplication rate of each cell you can get that by using `--dumpFeature` flag in the Alevin run and look for file `featureDump.txt`. There will be a dump of multiple features w/ each CB but the second (starting from 0) column of the file gives you the duplication rate of each CB.

Availability,"Ok, I figured it out :) — these two *decoy* references are (1) identical with each other and (2) collide with *another* decoy reference. Currently, the way we process decoys, we don't allow duplicate decoys (it makes even less sense to allow duplicate decoys than to allow duplicate transcripts). However, the reason indexing worked with `k=17` is not because of `k` but because of the `--keepDuplicates` flag. With that flag, these decoys get added. I think the right thing for us to do on our part is to remove duplicate *decoys* if they appear in the reference and the user has not passed `--keepDuplicates`. . However, for the time being, I think the best thing to do is simply to remove `AABR07022993.1` and `AABR07023006.1` from the `toplevel` file and from `decoys.txt`, since the sequence they contain is already represented in the decoy part of the index.

Availability,"Ok, nothing about your hardware, as reported, above, raises any ideas. I'll keep looking at the code that executes between the end of VBEM and Gibbs. However, one thing we might try to narrow down the offending region is running salmon under `gdb` (I can do this as well, but it's not useful on my end yet since I can't get the hanging behavior). If you run salmon under `gdb` and then issue a `SIGINT` (i.e., press `ctrl+C`) when the hanging behavior occurs, this will return you to `gdb`. At that point, you can issue the backtrace command (`bt`) at the `gdb` prompt, and it will tell us where in the code the thread was at the point the process was interrupted.

This also allowed quantification (with bias correction) to run to completion. @mikelove, can you validate that this fixes things on your end? If so, perhaps @tomsing1 could also validate that this is the same root cause of the issue for him?

Availability,"Oki, so I have updated a couple of things in the latest commit on the develop branch, which should make the things more streamlined. . * `maxNumBarcodes`: As you have initially used `maxNumBarcodes` which is by default set to 100k it means. by default alevin quantifies 100k CBs which includes both the low and high confidence CB count. You can change this number accordingly to set the universe of the top CB to quantify.; * `KeepCBFraction` : It defines what fraction of `maxNumBarcodes` to be used as the high confidence barcodes and should definitely generate the quants for. If set to 1 then everything is high confidence and the whitelisting cannot be performed. Thanks to this issue, alevin will not fail without error when there is no low confidence CB is found instead it checks if the number of low confidence CB is less than `lowRegionMinBarcodes` (default to 200), alevin will warn and not perform the whitelisting.; * `freqThreshold`: This is used to filter out most obvious cases to filter out CB with frequency less than set by the parameter (default to 10). Hope this help ! I am also testing on my end for any other potential bug.

I think the confusion is you are thinking of the concept of Selective Alignment as the same as aligning to transcriptome w/ decoys (can be genome or mashmap based). Although they are related methods but the concept of Selective Alignment predates the idea of decoy based alignment, checkout [this](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3233589) paper from our lab where we discuss how Selectively Aligning difficult reads to just the transcriptome itself can result in improved quantification estimates compared to quasi or pseduo alignment. To summarize: ; In version 1.0; A) SA: The mashmap and bedtools based pipeline which follows old SalmonTools based pipeline.; B) SAF: Inbuilt salmon pipeline to consume genome and follows this pipeline.; C) If you don't provide any decoys, salmon will do Selective Alignment just on the transcriptome. The Release notes you quoted just means you cannot disable this feature i.e. you cannot fall back to quasi-mapping (in quasi mapping there is no alignment of the reads at all).

Availability,"So I got the data and am trying to repro the issue now (thanks!). Quick question. I noticed in your example command you have `--libType ISF`. However, you have single-end reads, so the appropriate library type would be `SF` (i.e., they can't be ""inward"" facing reads, b/c there is no mate for each read). When I run your command as is, but replace `ISF` as `SF`, my run completes successfully, and I don't get any `errorminEQClassWeight` output. Could you let me know if this makes any difference for you (also, sorry that, apparently, we're not outputting a useful error message when one passes in a paired-end library type with single-end data). edit: Actually, it's even stranger. I noticed that in your command the library type comes *after* the reads to which it refers, but in this case, Salmon will not apply that library type to those reads (which explains why you're not getting a warning message). The restriction that the `--libType` flag comes before the reads it describes is buried in [the docs](http://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html#using-salmon), but I definitely need to make that clearer. Anyway, the point is that, in this case, Salmon should apply the ""default"" single-end library type (i.e., `U`) to your reads. So, presumably, that was what was happening when you saw the strange behavior during Gibbs sampling (and is also what was happening when my Gibbs sampling run completed successfully).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/111#issuecomment-266927204:415,error,errorminEQClassWeight,415,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/111#issuecomment-266927204,4,['error'],"['error', 'errorminEQClassWeight']"

Availability,"Sorry if I wasn't clear. Also, maybe I am trying to bluntly transpose a; metric that comes from alignment-based quantification.

To be more precise, I am not sure to see how it; could be a problem in this computation. But I am probably missing an; important point?. The idea of quasi-mapping as I understand is identifying the transcripts; from which the reads could have originated, generating a quantification.; For the sequencing saturation, we don't really need to know where the; read align on the transcript sequence, we just want to know that the; read comes from one single transcript, a unique UMI. So if I am right,; it is possible to summarize this quantification at the level of UMIs,; and have an idea of the duplication level of the transcripts that have; been tagged with UMIs. From what I understand, this is where alevin; perform the deduplication computation to have a correct idea of the; transcript amount when UMI are added, prior amplifications resulting; from the RT/PCR steps. So I was imagining it could be possible to take the gene quantifications; from (de)duplicated UMIs, gene quantifications from unique UMIs, using; them to have an idea of the amount/ratio of redundant information in the; sequencing data, producing a metric very similar to the seq sat from the; 10x definition.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/267#issuecomment-414331344:1449,redundant,redundant,1449,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/267#issuecomment-414331344,2,['redundant'],['redundant']

Availability,"Thanks @Gaura! Sounds promising. . Can you clarify what differences you saw between v1/v2 protocols? My understanding was that the only changes were slight differences in barcode positions within the barcode read, ie something that could be handled with different `bc-geometry`, but maybe that's all you meant in terms of differing implementations. Regarding the BC1 and how it could be two sequences for the same sample - this is confusing to explain in text format, but all comes down to the sequential nature of how the cells acquire barcodes in this protocol. We start with a 96-well plate, where each of the top 48 wells contain BOTH an oligo-dT barcode and random hexamer barcode. The samples then get added to each well. Biochemistry happens. Then you pool all the cells together, split them back out into 48 wells again, and each well gets its own BC2. Then repeat for BC3. . So a given transcript may get amplified via one of two amplification primers (oligo-dT or random hexamer), but after that, will get a single BC2 sequence and BC3 sequence added after that. In Fig 1A of the Rosenberg paper, it's as though there isn't _just_ an orange sequence carrying out reverse transcription, there are actually two different (known) sequences associated with different routes of amplification per cell. . The net effect is that a given cell can contain transcripts that have a sequence like this:; AACGTGAT-CTGTAGCC-ACACAGAA. or like this:; GATAGACA-CTGTAGCC-ACACAGAA. where maybe the first sequence was amplified by oligo-dT and the second was amplified via a random hexamer. Because they have the same BC2 and BC3 sequence, and the BC1 sequences match a known pairing, we know they come from the same cell and therefore the data should be merged. . Any lab running these experiments will have a table of known pairings (ie the two barcodes added to each of first 48 wells), so that they can be merged and treated as though they came from the same cell. This can either be handled upstream of sal",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-937918722:482,down,down,482,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-937918722,2,['down'],['down']

Availability,"Thanks @Ryan-Zhu ,. A couple of thoughts.; To me the data seem a little noisy as a lot of CB/reads are thrown away due to ""knee"" thresholding.; Check https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/362 if you wanna play with how to customize alevin for user-define whitelisting. Having said that this is how you can parse the data from alevin.; Alevin use 1277 CB after its knee thresholding + 638 low confidence Barcode for downstream whitelisting = total 1915 CBs.; If you check the warning in the log it says :. ```; [2019-06-12 15:07:08.152] [alevinLog] [warning] Skipped 313 barcodes due to No mapped read; ```; Basically it means out of 1915, 313 didn't had any read mapped to them, so alevin doesn't report them in the output matrix. Alevin reports 1915 - 313 = 1602 CBs both in `.mtx` and `quants_mat.gz` file. You can check the order of the CB in the `quants_mat_rows.txt` file, which has 1602 rows/CBs. If you don't provide alevin with external whitelist alevin tries to do post whitelisting of it's own. Basically out of the 1277 high confidence CBs alevin initially find out through knee it assigns 647 CBs as final whitelisted CB as found in the `whitelist.txt` file. If you wan't to subsample these CBs you have to extract the information from the `.mtx` or `quants_mat.gz` file.

Availability,"Thanks @juugii for the detailed response and clarifying my doubts.; It surely is possible to lose some information when projecting the data on lower dimensional space since none of the methods, CCA and MNN, are lossless. I do see your point and would like to understand more about the depth normalization problem you are facing with different experiments. . I tried to search the algorithm used by cellranger to aggregate the counts and it looks like the following:; * As I was saying earlier aggregation step was happening downstream of count/quantification of the gene count matrix, at least in cellranger pipeline.; > When doing large studies involving multiple biological samples (or multiple libraries or replicates of the same sample), it is best to run cellranger count on each of the libraries individually, and then pool the results using cellranger aggr. * It looks like they have three different modes to normalize the libraries; > There are three normalization modes:; mapped: (default) Subsample reads from higher-depth libraries until they all have an equal number of confidently mapped reads per cell.; raw: Subsample reads from higher-depth libraries until they all have an equal number of total (i.e. raw, mapping-independent) reads per cell.; none: Do not normalize at all. * Although it's not clear, what do they mean by `equal number of confidently mapped reads per cell`, does it mean median reads per cell ? Like you tried to show in the above plot the distribution can be very uneven. But the part that troubles me more is once `count` information has been generated it has lost the read level information, since we have deduplicated them, then how do they use the read counts to normalize.

The issue we have is that we're trying to run a pipeline in a fairly high-throughput manner to get a sensible 'enough' matrix without too much manual intervention. So I'm trying to avoid anything that requires an eyeballing step, accepting that the matrix we get will be less optimal than one you'd get from manual optimisation. Where possible, our curators are extracting the expected cell numbers from publications, so sometimes I have at least a general idea of where to look for an elbow/ feature. @roryk - have you used your alternate view on the data to automatically derive cutoffs?

Asking since you people are the pioneers in this aspect of problem solving.; I have to determine the expression of GFP and Transposon sequence in the transcriptome.; I read the material posted on the link https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html.; It instructs this to be done in 2 different ways-; There are two options for generating a decoy-aware transcriptome:. The first is to compute a set of decoy sequences by mapping the annotated transcripts you wish to index against a hard-masked version of the organism’s genome. This can be done with e.g. MashMap2, and we provide some simple scripts to greatly simplify this whole process. Specifically, you can use the generateDecoyTranscriptome.sh script, whose instructions you can find in this README. The second is to use the entire genome of the organism as the decoy sequence. This can be done by concatenating the genome to the end of the transcriptome you want to index and populating the decoys.txt file with the chromosome names. Detailed instructions on how to prepare this type of decoy sequence is available here. This scheme provides a more comprehensive set of decoys, but, obviously, requires considerably more memory to build the index. I tried the 2nd approach. Combined the GFP,Transposon and the genome FASTA files, indexed it , constructed the decoy according to the given instructions given here https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2019/selective-alignment/.; When I ran Salmon (version 1.2.1_linux_x86_64) it did not report anything in the quant files (I know that these samples have high GFP and Transposon expression in these samples).

Availability,"Thanks for the detailed report @idinsmore1,. These are quite different versions of ensembl, and so changes in the underlying transcriptome can absolutely have an effect on estimated abundances. Specifically, as the newer releases of ensemble tend to annotate more and more isoforms, there are more potential explanations for the reads. Reads that may have been previously assigned to an isoform in the old annotation may better match to a new isoform in the new annotation, etc. This will affect the read assignment and TPM both to the isoform to which the reads were originally being assigned and the new isoform to which the reads are now being assigned. . One thing to look at would be to see how much things change at the gene level, where we'd expect mapping uncertainty to be much lower.

Availability,"Thanks for the feedback!. I tried playing with the vbPrior setting and observed that, as you noted, higher increases of the vbPrior tended to flatten out the read apportionment, such that as the vbPrior increased the two transcripts became increasingly similar in their final expression (presumably they would eventually hit 50/50). It's good to know how that settings affects my data, but this is not quite what I was hoping for... . Ideally, the short transcript would get nearly *all* of the reads, rather than splitting the reads 50/50 or, with the default settings, giving nearly all the reads to the longer transcript. I realized that, as a human, the reason the short transcript is obviously the dominant one is how the reads pileup in the alignment. There are hundreds of reads mapping to both transcripts, but NO reads map to the 5' of the long transcript. As I understand the selective alignment, the alignment scores are passed to the quantification step, but the *position* of the reads is not used downstream. In order to pass my human intuition along here, the software would need to pay attention to the coverage bias of the reads mapping to the transcripts and assign a penalty when two otherwise identical transcripts have a different coverage variance across the transcript. This sounds like what the --posBias flag should incorporate into the effective lengths, but it doesn't have much effect on these transcripts for me (FYI, I am getting a segfault when I run only --posBias in the current salmon version, but if I run all the models together like --gcBias --seqBias --posBias, it completes fine). . Also, my intuition for these transcripts is not really a coverage ""bias"" as much as the read depth absolutely plummeting at the 5' end of the long transcript. It would be neat if Salmon could detect these kinds of dramatic dropoffs and add a warning or something... even if not incorporating the information into the quants... it could even be a good QC step to identify large de",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/514#issuecomment-623043651:1011,down,downstream,1011,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/514#issuecomment-623043651,2,['down'],['downstream']

Availability,"Thanks for the response. . The transcriptional variants I've been interested often are quite similar (e.g. only differ for a small part of one exon). Therefore, many of the reads (especially when they map to parts of the genes that don't differ) show up as pseudoaligned to multiple variants, as you'd expect. In that case, do you suggest only looking at the uniquely mapped reads, or only looking at primary alignments for each read, or still looking at all reads (perhaps with a certain `AS` score) for a given transcript? I'm mostly interested in performing sanity checks that transcriptional variants identified by Salmon/Swish are differentially used across conditions.

How would Salmon currently handle this situation where the first half of a sequence (e.g. nt 1-50) could be quasi-mapped to a transcript but the second half (nt 51-100) did not match anywhere?

Second, the second and third transcripts appear to be exact duplicates.

Availability,"This happens when there was no read in the same length bin during training period (the first so many reads are used for training) as the read under consideration. So Salmon can't assigned a valid log likelihood and an error is reported. The 3 errors are really the same one. The error log likelihood of 3 models are added (based on position of first mismatch/indel, length of clipping at each end of the read). If the length bin is empty for 1 model, it is likely empty for the other 2 models, and 3 warnings are printed when 1 would have been enough. This read gets a error likelihood of 1 and is mostly ignored by Salmon after that. Such reads should be rare by definition (unless the input BAM was not randomized, or there is bug) and this warning should be rare as well.

Typically that sort of operation doesn't care what the top level is named. For some future release, perhaps the run time dynamic loading of libraries could look up the path to libtbb.so.2 and try that first, before falling back to LD_LIBRARY_PATH? On my system ldd of salmon shows a link to libtbb.so.2, no LD_LIBRARY_PATH needed. ldd does not show any links to libtbb.malloc*. The program will do at least ""salmon --help' that way without any errors or warnings. That isn't sufficient to pass ""make test"" though (even when the directory has not been renamed).

Availability,"Unfortunately it's getting into a little under explored territory. ; Retrospectively, it does makes sense to have such a threshold but sadly in the current version we don't have that option. If it may help, I just got some stats for 10x data and generally it's around top < 1% of the data which is useful, which should be even lower in dropseq.

My guess is keeping the `keepCBFraction` even to 0.1 (i.e. 10%) would get you decent number of empty/low confidence CB to correct for downstream but you might have to explore a little. Another caveat is, having too many CB blows up the memory for downstream whitelisting of alevin and currently there is no option to disable that whitelisting, again a must have feature which is missing.

Availability,"Well, one can certainly use a tool (like gffread or rsem-prepare-reference) to take a genome and a (possibly custom/augmented) GTF to extract a set of target transcripts. Above, it looks like you were only processing between 90 and 100k transcripts. Given the overall size of the overall reference — ~2.4 billion nucleotides — my guess would be that some of these transcripts may be exceedingly long (and perhaps extracted incorrectly from the underlying tool). I should note that an index can be built on large references (which is why we support 64-bit index construction), but it's a very rare use-case as most transcriptomes (even large _de novo_ transcriptomes) rarely cross the 2^31 barrier, and I would expect it to consume quite a bit of memory. The default `quasi` indexer of Salmon is optimized to be very fast for typical sized transcriptomes (usually a few hundred mega-bases) at the cost of using more memory. The alternative `fmd` index can be made more memory efficient, by setting a larger sampling factor, but the resulting mapping will be slower (though still much faster than standard alignment). I would first check to see if the transcripts.fa file contains what you were expecting (i.e. the normal transcriptome + the auxiliary transcripts you were interested in quantifying), and that you actually have close to 2.4Gb of non-redundant transcriptome sequence that you want to quantify. If this is the case, the options are to try and build the quasi-index on a large memory machine (building the index requires more memory than mapping with the constructed index), or using the fmd-index with a large sampling factor.

Availability,"Yep, that is what I was reflecting at earlier. Using `--dumpFeatures` you can get the file `filtered_cb_frequency.txt` (this is after CB seq correction, `raw_cb_frequency` is before seq correction). As the file is reverse sorted by frequency you can count the number of CB with frequency `>100` and use that for the `--forceCell`. It does makes alevin multiple pass algorithm but that was the current use case with complex dataset where it fails to find the knee. . One thing to note here would be the downstream whitelisting. If the number of CB becomes too many then it can potentially blow up the memory. However, since you are already parsing the names of the CB (in your awk script) you can pass those CB as the `--whitelist`, alevin will still sequence correct the remaining CB with 1-edit distance around them. The benefit of this is, alevin will not run downstream whitelisting as a list of whitelisted CB has been provided externally.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/362#issuecomment-490907226:502,down,downstream,502,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/362#issuecomment-490907226,2,['down'],['downstream']

Availability,"against even attempting this is because it doesn't properly address any issue with respect to an actual biological analysis. That is, even if you could fix, precisely, the update order and initialization conditions for a specific sample to eliminate any variation between runs, almost all experiments consist of multiple samples. In other samples, the same transcript fractions could give rise to a slightly different set of observed fragments that induce exactly the same type of variation under uncertainty; and since that uncertainty is baked into the sample, it cannot and should not be removed. Having exact replication of a sample at a numerical threshold below the inferential uncertainty for a transcript conveys false confidence in the precision of the estimate. This is why, for transcript-level analysis, we highly recommend having salmon produce posterior gibbs samples (with the `--numGibbsSamples` flag). This will draw samples from the posterior distribution over the abundance estimates and allow determination of what inferences can be made robustly and what cannot. We have spent a good deal of time thinking about how to properly perform statistical inference on these uncertain quantities, and so I'd point you at [swish](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/fishpond/inst/doc/swish.html), which is a tool for differential analysis at the transcript level that makes uses of a non-parametric test over the inferential replicates (Gibbs samples) to incorporate uncertainty into the differential analysis. We also developed a tool [terminus](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/Supplement_1/i102/5870485) that makes use of the Gibbs samples and point estimates of salmon to group together transcripts whose individual abundances cannot be reliably inferred given the fragments in the sample.

While the best way to properly assess, propagate and handle uncertainty in transcript-level inference is still, in my opinion, an active area of research in the field, these are some solutions we've come up with to address this challenge so far. And while, as a computer scientist myself, I _certainly_ appreciate the desire to be able to have e.g. exactly the same numerical output for a particular sample, we feel that doing so might convey a false sense of certainty in the resulting estimates (and it would also be very difficult to do, technically, given the streaming asynchronous phase of the method). This also means, of course, that you should be wary of the precision between runs even for methods that produce their estimates in 100% deterministic ways (e.g. RSEM, etc.); you may get identical or near identical numbers, but without an estimate of the uncertainty, th",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/613#issuecomment-757989858:4274,reliab,reliably,4274,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/613#issuecomment-757989858,2,['reliab'],['reliably']
Availability,"atible with the appropriate strand type (which may be unstranded if that is the protocol). Salmon is pretty conservative about reporting when there is any ambiguity. By default, if the strand bias is stronger than a few percent. In a stranded protocol, it will report and if it infers more than a few percent of fragments no having a valid alignment. So you can always double-check samples where the strandedness is at all ambiguous. > In addition, if a transcript was aligned in a unstranded manner and ended up aligning to the wrong location due to ambiguity between the positive orientation of one transcript and the negative orientation of another, can salmon correct this by reassigning it to the right transcript based on the joint probability of all the other alignments (if you can't tell I'm at the edge of my BS zone)?. If there is not an alignment to the correct location _in addition to_ the wrong location, then no. If you run salmon in alignment mode, it will assign each fragment probabilistically to the set of transcripts to which it aligns. There is, by definition, a probability of 0 for a fragment being assigned to a location where it doesn't align. That is, the reported alignment positions should contain the true alignment. STAR is pretty good at reporting all equally good alignments, but you could see some corner cases (e.g. if there is an alignment to a pseudogene location that looks _very_ similar to a gene, etc.). However, these are the issues that arise due to the inherent difficulty of spliced alignment. Salmon's built-in [selective alignment](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02151-8) is quite sensitive, but if you're using the STAR alignments for other tasks apart from transcript quantification, it may not be worth it to align the reads twice. Overall, STAR unstranded (using the `--quantMode TranscriptomeSAM`) -> salmon with `-l A` and then checking samples where there are any warnings should be a pretty robust pipeline.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/590#issuecomment-733417813:2815,robust,robust,2815,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/590#issuecomment-733417813,1,['robust'],['robust']

Availability,"coefficient I did mention (pE[0;1]). An implementation of this approach as an option during the transcript quantification would be great. I can provide you with the simple python script I use for the subsampling, but I am not sure if it is the proper way to subsample during alevin quantification. >when you say cellranger subsampling, do you mean the cellranger aggregate pipeline?. Yes, sorry for not clearly stating it. I did use the cellranger aggregate function indeed, which by default subsample the expression matrices with high sequencing depth depending on amount of mapped reads, if I understand well. >Use Alevin w/o any modification to the fastq on both of your sample to generate the gene count matrices. I already did that, in downstream analyses I have a batch effect issue related to the sequencing depth. >that's why we recommend using the Seurat package downstream of the Alevin quantified matrices. I have some experience with downstream analyses with Seurat, Pagoda, Scater, scanpy and a few other tools, and I am aware of batch correction methods like CCA or MNN. But that is not what I am looking for here. I did both CCA and MNN but I loose some important information in the resulting eigenspaces or corrected matrix. I believe the proper way to correct my batch effect is to simply fix the difference between my two libraries, ie. the sequencing depth in this case. As I explained in my first message, cellranger aggregate (subsampling based on the amount of mapped reads) works very well in my case, correct the effect without any loss or modification of important genes in our scientific question. Not CCA or MNN. I would like to be able to do the same from the alevin quantifications. So I am looking for a proper way to apply a correction before/during/after the alevin quantification, in a way similar to what cellranger do with STAR. Alternatively, could a subsampling covariate be added to the probalistic quantification model of alevin (if I understand it well), in sor",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/305#issuecomment-433319913:1258,down,downstream,1258,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/305#issuecomment-433319913,2,['down'],['downstream']

I would prefer to have an option where I could potentially conclude the cell count is different than provided by CellRanger. . However, I will at least check to confirm this solves the problem with the error message that I am seeing (with the much smaller cell barcode list).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/682#issuecomment-879347665:1973,error,error,1973,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/682#issuecomment-879347665,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"e result is that for transcripts that have large inferential uncertainty, different numbers of reads can be assigned between runs. We have thought *a lot* about this behavior, what it means, and how the `NumRead` values should best be communicated to users. At the end of the day, the `NumReads` constitute the expected value of latent variables inferred in a _very_ high-dimensional space (# of parameters is at least the number of transcripts). Therefore, there are certain transcripts, whose estimated number of reads simply have _tremendous_ inferential uncertainty — and small perturbations in the initial conditions of the optimization will lead to different estimated values for their abundances. For those transcripts where you observe such fluctuations between runs, this is simply evidence that the precision that can be confidently placed on those estimates is below the degree of variation you observe. Treating these transcripts in downstream analysis as more certain can easily lead to spurious inferences regarding things like differential transcript expression or usage. . One can make an argument for trying to provide a way to enforce removal of this variation (which, granted, would be a challenge). However, the reason we decided against even attempting this is because it doesn't properly address any issue with respect to an actual biological analysis. That is, even if you could fix, precisely, the update order and initialization conditions for a specific sample to eliminate any variation between runs, almost all experiments consist of multiple samples. In other samples, the same transcript fractions could give rise to a slightly different set of observed fragments that induce exactly the same type of variation under uncertainty; and since that uncertainty is baked into the sample, it cannot and should not be removed. Having exact replication of a sample at a numerical threshold below the inferential uncertainty for a transcript conveys false confidence in the preci",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/613#issuecomment-757989858:2177,down,downstream,2177,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/613#issuecomment-757989858,2,['down'],['downstream']

So, there is a very high fraction of the reads that align to the genome, but a much smaller fraction ~45%-50% that align to the transcriptome. There are many reasons something like this could happen, but it suggests that there are a lot of reads being generated from outside of annotated transcripts. This could be a mix of novel transcripts in this sample (both at entirely novel loci, as well as novel transcripts within annotated loci), as well as of noisy transcription, unannotated transcribed pseudogenes etc. I took a look at the bigwig generated by this pipeline, and STAR seems to be mapping quite a lot of reads to chr21 as well as to the mitochondrial genome (chrM). However, as evidenced by the fact that neither salmon using selective-alignment (and mapping to the transcriptome) nor the STAR->salmon pipeline see these reads mapping to annotated transcripts they must be arising from outside of these regions. There are a few option in this case. You could manually investigate where these reads are coming from by aligning them with e.g. STAR and inspecting the BAM files. Alternatively, you could attempt to assemble novel transcripts (e.g. using StringTie or Scallop) and then add them to the transcriptome for quantification. However, it does seem that getting down to the bottom of the relatively low mapping rate to the annotated transcriptome, in light of the relatively high mapping rate to the whole genome, but outside of annotated transcripts, may require a bit more digging.

Availability,"eports to be valid with respect to the annotated transcriptome. I am guessing that many alignments overhang the end of the annotated transcripts, and so STAR does not project them to the transcriptome and so salmon cannot count them. **In mapping mode**, the nf-core pipeline makes use of salmon's selective-alignment _with decoy sequences_. The main purpose of this is to avoid spurious mapping to transcriptomic sequences that may be similar to other unannotated sequences in the genome that are nonetheless a better match for the read (e.g. an unannotated possibly transcribed pseudogene). The way this works in practice is that both the transcript sequences themselves *and the full genome* are indexed. Any read that aligns _strictly better_ to the genome than the transcriptome is considered to map to a decoy, and is not used for the purposes of quantification. Consistent with the behavior I hypothesized above for STAR, if you have many softclipped bases at the end of the read that nonetheless match what is in the genome downstream of the end of the annotated transcript, you'll likely see these reads assigned as decoys. To check this, you can look at salmon's `meta_info.json` output file to see how many reads were mapped best to decoys. * Why do I see much higher counts for this gene with FeatureCounts?. * It depends on the specific behavior you invoke. However, my guess is that FeatureCounts is being run with flags such that reads that only somewhat overlap a feature are nonetheless assigned to it. This suggests that while no good alignment may actually exist to the annotated transcript, FeatureCounts is still assigning the read to that feature because it overlaps it to some degree and matches the corresponding location on the genome.

Availability,"es. Those jobs are still running (it's only been about 4hrs as of this writing, I'll update my post if/when they complete). Current logs are showing that they quickly consume all the available memory, but have not yet crashed. I've also got versions with 128-512GB of memory requested (by powers of 2) for comparison. Some random notes: both the 31-mer index experienced about twice as many soft page reclaims with the new/faster version and experienced a few hard page faults (the previous version saw none of the latter). The 17-mer version experienced fewer page reclaims than any of the 31-mer indices and far fewer than with the prior version. Again, a few page faults crept in, but relatively few by percentage and likely not contributing any significant amount of time overall. [index-qacct-17mer.log](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/files/4246516/index-qacct-17mer.log); [index-qacct-31mer.log](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/files/4246517/index-qacct-31mer.log). **UPDATE**; The 16GB version finished running. It actually only took a little over 4 hours to run, as well. The troubling thing about this job seems to be that, despite having successfully completed, according to the accounting log it used over 20GB of memory... which should be impossible to do. Our resident experts suspect there's a race condition occurring at the tail end of the job and that all of that extra memory is being allocated before the scheduler can kill it for exceeding the limit. Whatever the case, though, this throws into question some of those numbers that I've been grabbing from the accounting logs --- it's either being misreported, or the memory gobbling is happening so rapidly that it may not, in fact, be being properly recorded. I tested the index anyway. It *appears* to be working just fine. Nothing faulted or crashed when I attempted to quantify some reads against it.

Availability,"h is in the `aux_info` subdirectory of the quantification directory for a sample), you can see how many mappings are being discarded by virtue of being dovetail mappings. It is possible to allow such alignments (consider them as concordant) by passing the `--allowDovetail` flag. It is not the case that such alignments are always ""bad"", its simply that one would not expect many fragments to align in such a way, and if these constitute the overwhelming majority of the mappings, one might be suspicious about the underlying data. * Selective alignment actually _aligns_ the reads to the transcriptome. For this purpose, it performs end-to-end alignment. This means that if you suspect that the sample may contain adapters or very low-quality read ends, the reads should be trimmed prior to quantification. It is, therefore, worth checking how the mapping rate changes for some of these samples if the reads are trimmed first. * Selective alignment is more robust than quasi-mapping to the chosen value of `-k`, the minimum match length used when searching for alignments. I noticed that some of the samples contain relatively short reads, so you might see if the mapping rate changes if you adopt a smaller value of `-k` in the index (e.g. we use `23` in the [pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v2.full.pdf)). * You mention that this index doesn't contain any decoy sequence. This of course, should not affect the mapping rate. However, I'd be quite curious to see if you index the reference using the _whole genome_ as decoy (i.e. the SAF method from the pre-print), how many reads are discarded because they map better to a decoy sequence (this information can also be obtained from `meta_info.json`). This will tell you if something strange might be going on in those samples, like extensive rRNA contamination, that would lead to the observed mapping rates. You could also get this information using a tool like STAR, by asking it to produce both genomic and transcriptomi",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/482#issuecomment-582734798:3023,robust,robust,3023,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/482#issuecomment-582734798,2,['robust'],['robust']
Availability,"h read, the length of each observed fragment, etc.). That information goes away when the reads are summarized into range-factorized equivalence classes. Moreover, some of the model parameters learned during the online phase will depend (in their details) on the order in which observations are made. Ostensibly, observing the same data in the same order **and issuing updates to shared model parameters from worker threads in the same order** should result in identical values, however this has never been tested and was never a design goal. The reason for this is that differences between runs are within the bounds of the inherent inferential uncertainty of the estimated parameters anyway. That is, if one is relying on a specific value at a level of precision such that a different run of salmon would produce a value different enough to change a downstream analysis, then one is imparting more precision on the estimates than they can provide. Other methods that produce identical results between runs for these values may produce the same output, but the accuracy of the output at that level shouldn't be trusted in this case. The uncertainty of the parameter estimates can be evaluated based on the Gibb samples (or bootstrap replicates) that salmon computes. Of course, the small differences between runs rarely lead to differences in downstream analysis (almost certainly at the gene level and also at the transcript level if you use a differential testing method that is aware of inferential uncertainty). On the other hand, if you are in need of something that produces identical output between runs (but that still also lets you assess uncertainty), then you can give [piscem](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/piscem) => [piscem-infer](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/piscem-infer) a try.

What is the rationale for the current default of 100000?. That's again a great question. In short single-cell world is expanding rapidly and alevin was initially designed to work with 10x 3' data and some of the restriction are outdated with combinatorial indexing based multiplexed experiments. To be honest, 100k was just a random high enough number that was put down to throw away the obvious junk data. Having said that, you would notice that in both the logs you attached a significant fraction of barcodes are thrown away i.e., `Skipped 82268 barcodes due to No mapped read`, which is like ~82% of the 100k barcodes. Even if you include the 200k almost everything was thrown away, `[warning] Skipped 184123 barcodes due to No mapped read`. Although your point is important one why things are not getting sequence corrected with 200k, unfortunately I might have to do some more testing on that front to give more precise answer but in your case I'd advise keeping the default 100k bound, unless you are doing combinatorially-indexed data . > For the downstream analysis of such data, I usually work with both the read and UMI counts, but quants_mat.gz only contains the UMI counts.

Availability,"ing took a bit over an hour and consumed ~17GB of memory. This is about half the running time as the previous version, but approx. the same amount of memory requirement (more on that below). The 17-mer running, took 4.5hrs to complete and consumed ~64GB of memory. This particular running is again, about twice as fast, although the time really depends on the memory limitations I gave it. Since it appears that this version no longer crashes when given less than about 250GB of memory, I also tested with 32G and 16GB of memory, just to see what impact this would have on the times. Those jobs are still running (it's only been about 4hrs as of this writing, I'll update my post if/when they complete). Current logs are showing that they quickly consume all the available memory, but have not yet crashed. I've also got versions with 128-512GB of memory requested (by powers of 2) for comparison. Some random notes: both the 31-mer index experienced about twice as many soft page reclaims with the new/faster version and experienced a few hard page faults (the previous version saw none of the latter). The 17-mer version experienced fewer page reclaims than any of the 31-mer indices and far fewer than with the prior version. Again, a few page faults crept in, but relatively few by percentage and likely not contributing any significant amount of time overall. [index-qacct-17mer.log](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/files/4246516/index-qacct-17mer.log); [index-qacct-31mer.log](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/files/4246517/index-qacct-31mer.log). **UPDATE**; The 16GB version finished running. It actually only took a little over 4 hours to run, as well. The troubling thing about this job seems to be that, despite having successfully completed, according to the accounting log it used over 20GB of memory... which should be impossible to do. Our resident experts suspect there's a race condition occurring at the tail end of the job and that all of that extra memory is being allo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/476#issuecomment-590516702:1279,fault,faults,1279,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/476#issuecomment-590516702,1,['fault'],['faults']
Availability,"ingle-cell world is expanding rapidly and alevin was initially designed to work with 10x 3' data and some of the restriction are outdated with combinatorial indexing based multiplexed experiments. To be honest, 100k was just a random high enough number that was put down to throw away the obvious junk data. Having said that, you would notice that in both the logs you attached a significant fraction of barcodes are thrown away i.e., `Skipped 82268 barcodes due to No mapped read`, which is like ~82% of the 100k barcodes. Even if you include the 200k almost everything was thrown away, `[warning] Skipped 184123 barcodes due to No mapped read`. Although your point is important one why things are not getting sequence corrected with 200k, unfortunately I might have to do some more testing on that front to give more precise answer but in your case I'd advise keeping the default 100k bound, unless you are doing combinatorially-indexed data . > For the downstream analysis of such data, I usually work with both the read and UMI counts, but quants_mat.gz only contains the UMI counts. Can Alevin a produce a matrix of read counts as well. It would be a great feature to add. For now, what is easiest way to get the cell x feature matrix of read counts if I use the --dumpEq or --dumpBfh flags? Can tximport be used for this or do I need to use the Python parser first?. Congratulations on the awesome paper :). We were actually discussing yesterday about your paper and potentially modifying alevin to include model for correcting index-hoping, although it's still in discussion phase. To answer your question, thanks for the feature request, I can add that feature on the weekend if it's urgent. However, you can also generate that with the current version using the `--dumpBfh` flag and `bfh.txt` file. Unfortunately, since it's the first use case where we need the read-count matrix, we haven't included the support in `tximport` yet.

Availability,"n this aspect of problem solving.; I have to determine the expression of GFP and Transposon sequence in the transcriptome.; I read the material posted on the link https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html.; It instructs this to be done in 2 different ways-; There are two options for generating a decoy-aware transcriptome:. The first is to compute a set of decoy sequences by mapping the annotated transcripts you wish to index against a hard-masked version of the organism’s genome. This can be done with e.g. MashMap2, and we provide some simple scripts to greatly simplify this whole process. Specifically, you can use the generateDecoyTranscriptome.sh script, whose instructions you can find in this README. The second is to use the entire genome of the organism as the decoy sequence. This can be done by concatenating the genome to the end of the transcriptome you want to index and populating the decoys.txt file with the chromosome names. Detailed instructions on how to prepare this type of decoy sequence is available here. This scheme provides a more comprehensive set of decoys, but, obviously, requires considerably more memory to build the index. I tried the 2nd approach. Combined the GFP,Transposon and the genome FASTA files, indexed it , constructed the decoy according to the given instructions given here https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2019/selective-alignment/.; When I ran Salmon (version 1.2.1_linux_x86_64) it did not report anything in the quant files (I know that these samples have high GFP and Transposon expression in these samples).

Since it appears that this version no longer crashes when given less than about 250GB of memory, I also tested with 32G and 16GB of memory, just to see what impact this would have on the times. Those jobs are still running (it's only been about 4hrs as of this writing, I'll update my post if/when they complete). Current logs are showing that they quickly consume all the available memory, but have not yet crashed. I've also got versions with 128-512GB of memory requested (by powers of 2) for comparison. Some random notes: both the 31-mer index experienced about twice as many soft page reclaims with the new/faster version and experienced a few hard page faults (the previous version saw none of the latter). The 17-mer version experienced fewer page reclaims than any of the 31-mer indices and far fewer than with the prior version. Again, a few page faults crept in, but relatively few by percentage and likely not contributing any significant amount of time overall.

It actually only took a little over 4 hours to run, as well. The troubling thing about this job seems to be that, despite having successfully completed, according to the accounting log it used over 20GB of memory... which should be impossible to do. Our resident experts suspect there's a race condition occurring at the tail end of the job and that all of that extra memory is being allocated before the scheduler can kill it for exceeding the limit.

Availability,"ne phase and an offline phase. The online phase has access to _fragment-level_ information that is then summarized away during the offline phase (like the specific locations of each read, the length of each observed fragment, etc.). That information goes away when the reads are summarized into range-factorized equivalence classes. Moreover, some of the model parameters learned during the online phase will depend (in their details) on the order in which observations are made. Ostensibly, observing the same data in the same order **and issuing updates to shared model parameters from worker threads in the same order** should result in identical values, however this has never been tested and was never a design goal. The reason for this is that differences between runs are within the bounds of the inherent inferential uncertainty of the estimated parameters anyway. That is, if one is relying on a specific value at a level of precision such that a different run of salmon would produce a value different enough to change a downstream analysis, then one is imparting more precision on the estimates than they can provide. Other methods that produce identical results between runs for these values may produce the same output, but the accuracy of the output at that level shouldn't be trusted in this case. The uncertainty of the parameter estimates can be evaluated based on the Gibb samples (or bootstrap replicates) that salmon computes. Of course, the small differences between runs rarely lead to differences in downstream analysis (almost certainly at the gene level and also at the transcript level if you use a differential testing method that is aware of inferential uncertainty). On the other hand, if you are in need of something that produces identical output between runs (but that still also lets you assess uncertainty), then you can give [piscem](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/piscem) => [piscem-infer](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/piscem-infer) a try.

Availability,"ne should expect transcript (or even gene) abundances to stay the same under a change of annotation. The estimates computed by salmon (and by all transcript-level abundance estimation tools) is one that maximizes the likelihood of the data (or maximizes the ELBO in the case of VI) _conditioned on_ the observed fragments and the _transcripts_. When one changes the transcripts, they change the variable upon which the inference is conditioned, and the results, in general, can change (a lot, or a little bit). This is specifically most prone to happen when transcripts / genes are added to the annotation that are similar to other transcripts or genes in the annotation. Now, my specific thought based on your settings of parameters. They are _quite_ different, but the three big factors I see here are (1) the setting for `--scoreExp`, (2) the setting(s) for dovetail and softclipOverhangs and (3) the setting for `--consensusSlack` Why are they a big deal?. * `--scoreExp` determines how much we down-weight scores sub-optimal alignments. Setting `--scoreExp` to 0 says that a sub-optimal alignment, at least in terms of the alignment probability is _just as good as the optimal alignment_. So, imagine you had a few read length regions of a pair of genes that each differed by 1 or 2 SNPs. When `--scoreExp` is 0, then the model considers alignments (say to transcript 2) with 2 substitutions to be just as likely as alignments (say to transcript 1) that are perfect (with no substitutions). While you can play around with different values of `--scoreExp` to determine how differences from the optimal alignment should be weighted, I'd strongly suggest against setting `--scoreExp` equal to 0. * `--allowDovetail` and `--softclipOverhangs` may or may not have a significant effect based on the quality of your library and annotation. Ideally, you would have no dovetailed mappings and no reads overhanging annotated transcripts.

Availability,"ng of these considerations. It’s good to think about how data processing choices may affect your results and you are being thoughtful here. I wouldn’t say that, generally, alignment-free tools are more accurate than alignment-based ones. For example, you might look at our recent paper on how [alignment and mapping methodology can influence abundance estimation even when holding the quantification approach fixed](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02151-8), or [this paper on the corner cases of alignment-free methodology](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-018-4869-5) (note the second paper pre-dates the first, and the new selective-alignment methodology in salmon should largely address the issues raised in that paper). However, the bigger and more meaningful distinction is between methods that attempt to properly quantify abundance (generally using a generative statistical model) — including methods like RSEM, BitSeq, salmon, etc., and those that try to simply count aligned reads — including methods like HTSeq and featureCounts. Generally, the former type of methods are more accurate than the latter at both the gene level and the former can also offer transcript-level estimates if desired (counting based methods generally cannot). Finally, to your question more directly, I don’t believe that model misspecification that may result due to not knowing the fragment length distribution will generally have enough of a deleterious effect on the probabilistic quantification methods to degrade their performance to the level of counting based methods. I would still argue to prefer probabilistic quantification (i.e. salmon) to read counting, even if you don’t know the fragment length distribution. As I mentioned above, it may change the maximum likelihood estimates a bit, but should do so across all samples, hopefully minimizing the downstream effects on differential analysis.

Availability,"nto_ salmon. Specifically, it makes a lot of sense to have some component of the likelihood account for the coverage profile of transcripts. Yes! I've been analyzing a large dataset and my real motivating problem was not really the example I posted above, but distinguishing between pre-processed and fully-processed non-coding RNA transcripts. I'm attaching an image showing an example ncRNA; the two tracks are the same data, but the lower one shows abundance on a log scale. In this particular sample, it's easy to estimate that ~5-10% of the transcripts are pre-processed (the transcripts still have neighboring genomic DNA). I wanted to see how this ratio changes between samples (for example, in a snoRNA processing-defective mutant strain), but quickly realized this is not easily done in salmon or any other quant tools because the processed transcript is entirely a subset of the sequence of the pre-processed transcript. The only way to accurately quantify it is to use the coverage information, which as you agreed is not really taken into account downstream. If Salmon could incorporate the coverage information to solve this class of problem, that would indeed be a **huge win**. I think the ncRNA example would be both a great biologically-interesting motivating problem, as well as a good technical benchmark for implementing any new methods. It could even be used as a secondary RNA velocity measure in scRNA seq data, provided the method used can detect these (non-polyadenylated) transcripts. > The big questions are (1) how do you fold this type of intuition formally into the probabilistic model and (2) is it possible to incorporate this information efficiently?. This is definitely your domain of expertise (and I know it's a rhetorical question but I'd love to throw some ideas out here)...

Indeed coverage bias correction is an important part of the aggregation step but in general it's not the only one and that's why we recommend using the `Seurat` package downstream of the Alevin quantified matrices.

Availability,"on for the problems you are facing in alevin. >Your first question was related to alevin quantifying very less number of reads. To answer that,; if you look at the log, at the first few lines, alevin warns about ~91% of the reads being thrown away because; of the noisy CBs. The problem is alevin’s first “knee"" estimation is overshooting in predicting the first boundary. You will find https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/362 issue to be; very useful in understanding that. As a summary if you look at the plot I attached it has bi-modalities,; which is generally not the case and alevin is greedily finding the threshold at the first ~100 cells. If this; happens the general direction is to help alevin by proving a upper bound, in case of your data; would be ~14000 cells. You can tell alevin with `—expectCells 14000` and alevin start to work; normally and logs ~12% of the data is noisy. >You second question was a little complicated to answer.

Availability,"problem you are referring to. Secondly, I apologize for the long time it took me to get back at you. I would like you to know that we have been and are still working on possible solutions for addressing this problem, and here I would like to share some updates with you. . About the success cases, it was nice to know that the current model of Salmon with length correction works pretty well in recovering the right estimates for those ""easier"" cases where one transcript is fully contained in another one. Turning off the length correction, tells the Salmon model not to consider the effective length of each transcript for computing the conditional probabilities of originating a fragment from a transcript. So, for the RNA-seq data there is no reason to turn off this term of the model, and we highly recommend not to use that flag for the bulk RNA-seq abundance estimation with Salmon. Looking more carefully at the 2nd case you have posted as the failure case, it is interesting to see that there is a very nice visual evidence on the super transcript that the long transcript might not be expressed at all. I am referring to the zero coverage regions on the Super Transcript between the regions corresponding to the smaller transcripts, e. g., between POF1 and EMC1. So, we tried a solution that inspects the coverage profile of all transcripts and calculates the probability of observing a zero coverage region on each transcript. If this probability is too low, this would be counted as an evidence for a transcript not being expressed at all. This approach seems to be working fine on this example that you have shared here. however, one problem was that there were considerable number of reads in the sample that were uniquely mapping only to the Super Transcript and turning of the expression of that transcript would result in treating those reads as un-mapped. Furthermore, this problem was more evident when we tried that approach on other larger samples, it seemed that could effect the",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/514#issuecomment-666512703:1113,failure,failure,1113,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/514#issuecomment-666512703,2,['failure'],['failure']

Availability,"script set and the vector of conditional probability bins into which the mapping falls with respect to each transcript in the equivalence class. This means that range-factorized equivalence classes can have multiple classes of fragments that map to the same set of transcripts, but with different conditional probabilities. Additionally, for each bin, the average conditional probability of fragments arising from that bin is maintained. What you are seeing printed out are the transcript sets, followed by the conditional bin indexes. Starting in the next release (and currently in the develop branch), we've cleaned up the interaction of the range-factorized equivalence classes with the `--dumpEq` and `--dumpEqWeights` flags. If you run with the `--dumpEqWeights` flags, salmon will dump the transcript sets, followed by the conditional probability vector, followed by the fragment count. If you run with the `--dumpEq` flag, it will collapse all of the range-factorized equivalence classes into ""simple"" equivalence classes by combining classes with the same transcript set (but different conditional probability vectors) and summing the corresponding fragment counts. This, of course, is a lossy transformation, and the equivalence classes will no longer represent the relevant conditional probabilities used during inference. Also, since the range-factorized equivalence classes allow for (but probabilistically down-weight) non-optimal mappings of fragments to transcripts, these collapsed equivalence classes will tend to have bigger labels (i.e. more transcripts) which might be difficult to properly interpret without the relevant conditional probabilities. The `--hardFilter` flag will filter out transcripts that have non-best alignment scores (a big component of the conditional fragment probability), but that can have a negative effect on the modeling and inference. We'll update the documentation accordingly when we cut the next release to make all of these interactions more clear.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/402#issuecomment-517041654:2324,down,down-weight,2324,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/402#issuecomment-517041654,2,['down'],['down-weight']

Availability,"tead and be more positionally flexible. But deciding how many indel bases are allowable, and presumably doing multiple passes through the data to establish an include-list could be time-consuming. Further, the zUMIs developer rightly mentions [in this thread](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/issues/63) that there are likely going to be _many_ unused barcode combinations this way, so lots of time could be spent looking for ""cells"" that don't actually exist in the data. The authors of the paper from which our test dataset was derived describe in their methods using a Drop-seq computational framework, so I'm not sure which approach theirs is more similar to. . The simplest approach here is certainly the automatic detection, but it will come at the cost of losing meaningful reads to frameshift errors. . My guess is this falls well out of the scope of alevin, but if you're interested in improving on that, there may be a middle ground between the two approaches above, one that I'm not sure if your group or others have attempted for other methods: we could essentially do a 2-pass barcode detection. The first pass would restrict based on positions like we're already doing, and establish an include-list of possible barcodes seen in the data. Then we could pass through the barcode sequences a second time, looking only for those sequence combinations, but allowing 1-2bp flexibility in the positions they occur, potentially rescuing some of the ones missed during the first pass. This would get around the issue of searching for thousands (or more) barcodes that never exist. . However, for your above sequences in red, we would still need to somehow collapse the barcodes `GATAGACA`, `ATAGACAT`, and `ATAGACAG`, but perhaps that can be achieved with some Levenshtein distance flexibility using the entire 24bp barcode sequence detected...? . Anyway sorry for the brainstorming dump, but the short answer is: we're probably stuck losing a bunch of reads due to positional errors like this",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-985554883:2489,error,errors,2489,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-985554883,2,['error'],['errors']

Availability,"the unique-region-derived prior... . But as I think about it... I realize I don't *really* know the underlying algorithmic details of the existing implements. But it would be **amazing** if you could incorporate this type of information into Salmon. I really hope some progress can be made here! . Thanks again for helping me out and showing interest in the motivating problem!. P.S.,; As a total aside, I've been working with this large yeast RNAseq dataset and eventually reached the same conclusions as the selective alignment paper and other recent ones; that is, the most important aspect for getting good transcript-level quantifications is not aligning to the genome vs. aligning to the transcriptome, but rather having an accurate transcriptome annotation to begin with. I saw **huge** gains from updating my transcriptome annotation to include UTRs, especially given differences in coverage bias between samples... for example, if the actual transcript is 500 bp but the gene body is only 200 bp, slight coverage biases can propagate non-linearly and cause huge problems downstream. This got me thinking... if the end goal is differential expression analysis (and obviously this is not *always* the end goal), what if we just discard the notion of a pre-defined transcriptome and stick with equivalence classes, then do differential expression analysis on the equivalence classes themselves (perhaps calculated against the whole genome... this is feasible in yeast, maybe not in humans), then only after discovering significant differential expression one could work backwards to interpret the changes. Is this a crazy idea? Or not crazy at all and already routine? I know salmon can dump the counts to each equivalence class already so it's not hard for me to *do* what I just described, but I'm wondering if you have any opinions/insights into this idea.

One thing I noticed during build is that, while I included `libjemalloc2` here, the salmon build procedure still downloaded and built `jemalloc`. However, I don't _think_ jemalloc is the thing causing the segfault. Regarding dependencies that can't be used — the current `libstaden` is behind the upstream release. The upstream release contains an important bug fix for a bug (and suggested fix that we proposed to the developer) upon which we rely. More importantly, afaik there is no relevant `libpufferfish-dev` package (we certainly have not made one), and so there is not even e.g. a check in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Salmon's build always tries to run `fetchPufferfish.sh` to download the relevant `pufferfish` source files needed to build `salmon`. Critically, the relevant `pufferfish` dependencies and `salmon` releases move in lockstep. Each new `salmon` release it accompanied by a new tag in the `pufferfish` repo (so that the specific source used to build a given `salmon` release is fixed and easily trackable). So, I think the easiest way to move forward is to:. * do a diff of my list of packages above with what is pulled in by `apt build-dep salmon`. * figure out why, even when `libjemalloc2` is installed, the build system tries to build `jemalloc` itself (maybe we need the dev package?). * determine what folks want to do upstream about the lockstep pufferfish dependency. Right now, the `fetchPufferfish.sh` script pulls a tagged tarball from github and checks that the sha matches, and moves the relevant source files into place. This is true both when we build our own releases as well as when `salmon` is built for other distribution channels like `conda`.

One thing I noticed during build is that, while I included `libjemalloc2` here, the salmon build procedure still downloaded and built `jemalloc`. However, I don't _think_ jemalloc is the thing causing the segfault. Regarding dependencies that can't be used — the current `libstaden` is behind the upstream release. The upstream release contains an important bug fix for a bug (and suggested fix that we proposed to the developer) upon which we rely. More importantly, afaik there is no relevant `libpufferfish-dev` package (we certainly have not made one), and so there is not even e.g. a check in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Salmon's build always tries to run `fetchPufferfish.sh` to download the relevant `pufferfish` source files needed to build `salmon`. Critically, the relevant `pufferfish` dependencies and `salmon` releases move in lockstep. Each new `salmon` release it accompanied by a new tag in the `pufferfish` repo (so that the specific source used to build a given `salmon` release is fixed and easily trackable). So, I think the easiest way to move forward is to:. * do a diff of my list of packages above with what is pulled in by `apt build-dep salmon`. * figure out why, even when `libjemalloc2` is installed, the build system tries to build `jemalloc` itself (maybe we need the dev package?). * determine what folks want to do upstream about the lockstep pufferfish dependency. Right now, the `fetchPufferfish.sh` script pulls a tagged tarball from github and checks that the sha matches, and moves the relevant source files into place. This is true both when we build our own releases as well as when `salmon` is built for other distribution channels like `conda`. While I am happy to have someone figure out how to package that up as a package that can be put into the repo and depe",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/835#issuecomment-1464538233:1208,release,releases,1208,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/835#issuecomment-1464538233,1,['release'],['releases']

Deployability," dependencies that can't be used — the current `libstaden` is behind the upstream release. The upstream release contains an important bug fix for a bug (and suggested fix that we proposed to the developer) upon which we rely. More importantly, afaik there is no relevant `libpufferfish-dev` package (we certainly have not made one), and so there is not even e.g. a check in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Salmon's build always tries to run `fetchPufferfish.sh` to download the relevant `pufferfish` source files needed to build `salmon`. Critically, the relevant `pufferfish` dependencies and `salmon` releases move in lockstep. Each new `salmon` release it accompanied by a new tag in the `pufferfish` repo (so that the specific source used to build a given `salmon` release is fixed and easily trackable). So, I think the easiest way to move forward is to:. * do a diff of my list of packages above with what is pulled in by `apt build-dep salmon`. * figure out why, even when `libjemalloc2` is installed, the build system tries to build `jemalloc` itself (maybe we need the dev package?). * determine what folks want to do upstream about the lockstep pufferfish dependency. Right now, the `fetchPufferfish.sh` script pulls a tagged tarball from github and checks that the sha matches, and moves the relevant source files into place. This is true both when we build our own releases as well as when `salmon` is built for other distribution channels like `conda`. While I am happy to have someone figure out how to package that up as a package that can be put into the repo and depended upon, we currently don't have the capacity to tackle that ourselves and don't have a suitable mechanism to replace the current approach to obtaining the dependent pufferfish files. However, this question is very important as e.g. a segfault exactly like the one you are encountering was actually a bug in the pufferfish source used in the 1.9.0 release of `salmon` that was _fixed_ for the 1.10.0 release.

If you wan't absolute values for per-CB reads and mapped reads, it should be in the file `filtered_cb_frequency.txt` and `mappedUMI.txt` respectively.; * `re: cellranger subsampling:` Correct me if I am wrong, when you say cellranger subsampling, do you mean the `cellranger aggregate` pipeline? It's possible you are talking about some other step which I am not aware of but if it's `aggregate` then I think it happens downstream of all the quantification. Indeed coverage bias correction is an important part of the aggregation step but in general it's not the only one and that's why we recommend using the `Seurat` package downstream of the Alevin quantified matrices. We will be more than happy to write a tutorial on, ""how to perform batch correction downstream of Alevin"" but in summary the following steps would be the gist of the process.; - Use Alevin w/o any modification to the `fastq` on both of your sample to generate the gene count matrices. (We have made a major upgrade to the Alevin. We'd recommend using [v0.12.0-alpha](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/v0.12.0-alpha) for now, we are planning to make an official release before the end of this week, currently you can use pre-release. Unfortunately, not available on conda yet).; - Import Alevin count matrices into R using [this](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2018/alevin-seurat/) tutorial .; - Use [this](https://satijalab.org/seurat/immune_alignment.html) to perform the batch correction. ; We do realize it's currently complicated to use things downstream of Alevin and are working constantly on improving the overall pipeline to make the analyses as smooth as possible. If you happen to write a tutorial of your own on doing the analyses, we'd be happy to include that in Alevin tutorial page. However, if you get stuck with any of the above steps do let us know, we'd be more than happy to help in that front too.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/305#issuecomment-433169468:2195,upgrade,upgrade,2195,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/305#issuecomment-433169468,8,"['pipeline', 'release', 'upgrade']","['pipeline', 'release', 'upgrade']"

So as you said I'd say its having issued finding the zlibs library. Similar to how I used 'DZLIB_LIBRARY=/users/work/jake/bin/zlib-1.2.11/zlib.h' to specify the zlib library for 'cmake', is there a way to do it for the 'make' command? I've tried using the following but haven't had success:; make -I /users/work/jake/bin/zlib-1.2.11/zlib.h; make --include-dir=/users/work/jake/bin/zlib-1.2.11/zlib.h.

Oh, I also had to update automake and autoconf because the 2 year old versions on this system were not new enough. Is there a static binary version of salmon available for download, Linux 64 bit? It looks like the default links are that way anyway, and that would save me what looks like at least another day of fighting with Cmake to force it to actually build a working make file. . You are developing on something like a recent Fedora or Ubuntu? In my experience packages which use boost and cmake inevitably cause a great great deal of pain when they are built on platforms like Centos or RHEL where long term support is one of the goals. They work fine on platforms which are cutting edge, but backwards compatibility extends back maybe 6 months or a year, tops.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/236#issuecomment-397025719:3183,install,install,3183,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/236#issuecomment-397025719,6,"['install', 'update']","['install', 'update']"

Deployability,"1) SoupX is generally working with the raw output from Cell Ranger. I beleive they use all 1-10CBs, and state something to the effect that the soup expression profile estimate is of good quality because there are such a large fractions of droplets in this range. 2) I see your point. Maybe the SoupX pipeline could be improved by using low count but high confidence CBs. 3) raw_cb_frequency.txt was also not written.

Deployability,"2 ; liblzma-dev ; libjemalloc2 ; pkg-config ; libgff-dev; ```. One thing I noticed during build is that, while I included `libjemalloc2` here, the salmon build procedure still downloaded and built `jemalloc`. However, I don't _think_ jemalloc is the thing causing the segfault. Regarding dependencies that can't be used — the current `libstaden` is behind the upstream release. The upstream release contains an important bug fix for a bug (and suggested fix that we proposed to the developer) upon which we rely. More importantly, afaik there is no relevant `libpufferfish-dev` package (we certainly have not made one), and so there is not even e.g. a check in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Salmon's build always tries to run `fetchPufferfish.sh` to download the relevant `pufferfish` source files needed to build `salmon`. Critically, the relevant `pufferfish` dependencies and `salmon` releases move in lockstep. Each new `salmon` release it accompanied by a new tag in the `pufferfish` repo (so that the specific source used to build a given `salmon` release is fixed and easily trackable). So, I think the easiest way to move forward is to:. * do a diff of my list of packages above with what is pulled in by `apt build-dep salmon`. * figure out why, even when `libjemalloc2` is installed, the build system tries to build `jemalloc` itself (maybe we need the dev package?). * determine what folks want to do upstream about the lockstep pufferfish dependency. Right now, the `fetchPufferfish.sh` script pulls a tagged tarball from github and checks that the sha matches, and moves the relevant source files into place. This is true both when we build our own releases as well as when `salmon` is built for other distribution channels like `conda`. While I am happy to have someone figure out how to package that up as a package that can be put into the repo and depended upon, we currently don't have the capacity to tackle that ourselves and don't have a suitable mechanism to replace the current app",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/835#issuecomment-1464538233:1253,release,release,1253,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/835#issuecomment-1464538233,2,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"://github.com/rob-p> mentions, your paper could help assess different methodologies for quantification and also help optimize salmon further for QuantSeq. I would still like you to check if you have used salmon quant command line correctly for QuantSeq data analysis. Your paper briefly alludes to QuantSeq Forward in the Introduction section of the paper. The QuantSeq Forward kit has an oligo (dT) primer which contains the Illumina-specific Read 2 linker ... but the Methods section of your paper does not specify if you have used QuantSeq FWD or REV. Page 14 of the PDF from the Lexogen Website data analysis pipeline for QuantSeq FWD<https://www.bluebee.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/015UG108V0201-QuantSeq-Data-Analysis-Pipeline_2018-10-18.pdf> recommends using the below htseq command line. htseq-count -m intersection-nonempty -s yes -f bam -r pos $bam; $resource_dir/annotation.gtf > $bam_dir/read_counts.txt. QuantSeq is a stranded protocol. For the QuantSeq FWD pipeline the argument -s yes indicates; stranded in the sense orientation. For the QuantSeq REV pipeline -s reverse is used. Similar to the above htseq command line arguments, I think if you are using QuantSeq FWD, the libType argument from salmon quant should have been SF. One way I checked these with my datasets was to run the salmon quant command 3 times - once with libType A, once with libType SF and once with libType SR -- with QuantSeq FWD the estimated counts will be almost same with libType A and libType SF. I echo what @rob-p<https://github.com/rob-p> says - Congratulations once again on the paper. —; You are receiving this because you were mentioned.; Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/449?email_source=notifications&email_token=AC4A5AGWBAOLTI4MOFLAJNDQYQN7FA5CNFSM4JOIEHZ2YY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFVREXG43VMVBW63LNMVXHJKTDN5WW2ZLOORPWSZGOEG3S5HQ#issuecomment-565653150>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AC4A5AFB7EMLYHVLVS",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/449#issuecomment-565684552:1981,pipeline,pipeline,1981,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/449#issuecomment-565684552,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"> Hi Brian,; > ; > In general, I would argue that one should be cautious with removing PCR duplicates in RNA-seq data (unless you are dealing with reads with UMI tags). This is because reads that align to the same reference position can easily have come from alternative transcripts sharing the same underlying sequence.

Deployability,"> In STAR there is an option to use stranded alignment (--readStrand, which can take ""Unstranded"", ""Forward"", or ""Reverse""). For the pipeline I'm building it would be ideal if I didn't have to specify the strandedness of the library as I'm not the one preparing the samples and it's not always easy to get that information from the scientist in the lab. As such, it would be great if I can use the default strandedness argument to STAR (""Unstranded"") and let salmon ""do the right thing"" by letting it choose the libType for me. With that in mind, if I let salmon choose for me (-l A) am I risking throwing out any data?. Right, so in this case, STAR should produce all highest-scoring valid alignments regardless of orientation. Then, when running salmon with `-l A` it will detect the strandedness and only discard alignments compatible with the appropriate strand type (which may be unstranded if that is the protocol). Salmon is pretty conservative about reporting when there is any ambiguity. By default, if the strand bias is stronger than a few percent. In a stranded protocol, it will report and if it infers more than a few percent of fragments no having a valid alignment. So you can always double-check samples where the strandedness is at all ambiguous. > In addition, if a transcript was aligned in a unstranded manner and ended up aligning to the wrong location due to ambiguity between the positive orientation of one transcript and the negative orientation of another, can salmon correct this by reassigning it to the right transcript based on the joint probability of all the other alignments (if you can't tell I'm at the edge of my BS zone)?. If there is not an alignment to the correct location _in addition to_ the wrong location, then no. If you run salmon in alignment mode, it will assign each fragment probabilistically to the set of transcripts to which it aligns. There is, by definition, a probability of 0 for a fragment being assigned to a location where it doesn't align.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/590#issuecomment-733417813:133,pipeline,pipeline,133,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/590#issuecomment-733417813,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"@demis001 Salmon's `--geneMap | -g` option does take a GTF file (although you're correct that it can also take a two-column text file, and I think accepting both types of files in the same option is a bit confusing). See some context in this [old issue](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/114). I believe the issue you're seeing is that Ensembl will update transcript (and gene I think) versions like so:. ```; !! this is not real data, just a toy example. ensembl v24; -------------; ENST0000001.1; ENST0000002.1. ensembl v25; -------------; ENST0000001.2; ENST0000002.2; ```; and the GTF file you used to build the salmon index is ""ensembl v24"", but now you only have ""ensembl v25"" available during the `salmon quant` run. . **The most correct thing** to do at this point would be to either rebuild the salmon index using ""ensembl v25"" and rerun `salmon quant -g ensembl_v25.gtf`, or get the ""ensembl v24"" GTF file (re-download from Ensembl website) and pass this to `salmon quant -g ensembl_v24.gtf`. . **The thing would probably be okay** is to allow passing GTF files that do not exactly match the transcript accessions, where ""ENST0000001"" is the ""accession"" and "".1"" is the ""version"" - hence ""accession.version"".

So, we know how to fix these case, but I'd like to understand *why* better before I push the fix upstream (and make sure it doesn't adversely affect other alignments). _edit_: Update to clarify the culprit is `extz2_sse` in combination with `KSW_EZ_RIGHT` and not just `KSW_EZ_RIGHT` by itself.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/475#issuecomment-574472965:517,Update,Update,517,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/475#issuecomment-574472965,1,['Update'],['Update']

In the ILMN analyses, there is great concordance between the SAF method and HISAT/STAR_RSEM method. However, in the QS analyses, there is very limited concordance between SAF and the HISAT/STAR_RSEM method. For QS analyses, the TXOME method shows great concordance with HISAT/STAR_RSEM.

Deployability,"@zhangchipku,. The default value of `--minScoreFraction` is quite reasonable, I think. It depends on the read length, but for a 100-bp read, it corresponds to 8 mismatches under the default scoring parameters. So the read pair could have up to 16 mismatches before being discarded. I understand that the recommendation to trim reads is a new one, but I think it is a standard best-practice anyway. However, we are looking at the possibility of allowing read-end soft-clipping in future releases, which could mitigate this need in the most common case. It is worth noting that, if you *don't* want to use selective alignment, then the last version of salmon that you can use is the one tagged as `0.15.0`. As of version 1.0.0, the index structure and default mapping algorithm changed, so that selective alignment is ""always on"". This is discussed in some detail in the release notes for version 1.0.0. Generally, we think that the benefits offered by selective-alignment are important, and, unless there is a very strong reason not to, one should generally ensure that reads sharing some exact matches with the reference also produce reasonable quality alignments at the implied loci. However, we also try to be very receptive and responsive to our users' workflows and desiderata, so if the soft-clipping feature is something that would make your experience much smoother, we will certainly consider prioritizing that feature for a future release.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/485#issuecomment-586478704:486,release,releases,486,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/485#issuecomment-586478704,6,['release'],"['release', 'releases']"
Deployability,"A BAM file can contain both paired and single-end reads. I haven't been using Salmon long enough to know whether it supports a mixture of paired and single reads. If it doesn't, then there's no issue, because you know immediately after reading the first mapped read whether it is paired. If Salmon does support a mixture of paired and single reads, then you have a problem, because you could have, for example, a BAM file with 10 million single-end reads and then one paired set of 2 reads. In other words, you can't conclude a BAM file is single-end only except by checking every read in the file. I think this means that in the worst case, `--libtype A` would require 2 passes through the BAM file, once to check for paired reads and then again to actually run the quantification. Here's a strategy that might work without 2 passes, possibly at the cost of increased peak memory usage. The release notes say that `--libType A` uses the first 50k reads to infer the lib type. So, read from the BAM file until enough read pairs (25k pairs?) have been read, and then infer the paired library type from those. However, if the first 100k reads don't yield 25k pairs, then just infer the orientation of the unpaired/first mate reads. In this case, now feed the input into 3 separate runs of the quantification at once, one for each possible paired library type. For example, if the first-read orientation is inferred as `SF`, then the 3 possible paired library types are `ISF`, `MSF`, and `OSF`. Run the entire file through each of these 3 quantifaction runs, and then decide afterward which one turned out to be correct (probably whichever one counted the most concordantly paired mates?). Then kill the other 2 runs and finish running the chosen one through the rest of the algorithm. That should avoid having to make multiple passes through the input, but you will triple some component of the memory usage up to the point where the two wrong runs are killed.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/79#issuecomment-241900687:892,release,release,892,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/79#issuecomment-241900687,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,A couple of question before you fix the pipeline to do this though: ; * In general what fraction of the CB does SoupX expects to have from 1-10 CB ?; * In our experience. a usual setup has <1% of the High confidence CB which alevin reports at the end. If you are keeping 10% of the CB then you already have >9% of the low quality stuff. I might have to read the SoupX paper again but I feel it's a lot of low quality data to begin with.; * Can you check what was the frequency of the last CB which was reported ? Because I do see; `Skipped 330862 barcodes due to No mapped read` in the log which mean even if there was >0 reads for the CB that doesn't map to the reference and alevin end up skipping it.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/379#issuecomment-503356703:40,pipeline,pipeline,40,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/379#issuecomment-503356703,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

In general, I think it is a nice pipeline that provides a good deal of information and a nice report. If you're looking for an off-the-shelf workflow for sample quantification for gene-level differential expression, I think that nf-core's RNA-seq workflow is a good option for quality-control and quantification. If you want to do transcript-level differential analysis, you may want to consider [swish](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/18/e105/5542870), in which case you need to make sure that salmon is run with parameters to generate inferential replicates (either `--numBootstraps X` or `--numGibbsSamples X`).

Deployability,"Dear @callumparr,. Thank you for bringing this up. So you are correct that the `--noLengthCorrection` flag should be passed to salmon when quantifying data that does not have a ""fragmentation effect"", that is, where the number of fragments we expect to draw from a transcript is not dependent upon the length of that transcript. In the ONT protocols, it is usually the case that we get 1 read -> 1 transcript, even if we don't read the whole thing. We have tested the effect of this in ONT data with spike ins, and have verified that using `--noLengthCorrection` does generally lead to improved accuracy with respect to quantification estimates. We have informed ONT of this, and I would guess they may optimize the flags that are used soon (we have also developed an error model that works correctly for these long reads, and that should make it into the next release of salmon). Regarding the effect this has on the `NumReads` values reported by salmon, it's not as simple as with the `TPM` estimates. The length affects the assigned reads through the probabilistic model on which inference is done. With the length effect we have that P(f | t_i) ∝ P( position | f, t_i ) * P( alignment | f, t_i) --- forgetting the alignment term for the time being, we have that with length correction P( position | f, t_i ) ∝ 1 / l_i and without length correction the l_i term goes away. In other words, the probability of allocating reads has a term that depends on the effective length when the `--noLengthCorrection` flag is not passed, but that term goes away when it is passed. This is not quite as drastic as with TPM where the normalization includes the length directly in the normalization (note, however, that when the `--noLengthCorrection` flag is passed, this adjusts the TPM as well). Further, the `NumReads` is still better than TPM in this regard because it still encodes the effect size (i.e. `NumReads` will sum to the total number of aligned reads). Anyway TLDR: Passing the `--noLengthCorrectio",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/651#issuecomment-821995147:861,release,release,861,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/651#issuecomment-821995147,2,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"FYI, I'm taking another crack at an official FreeBSD port, but still hitting some gnarly issues with 1.5.2, so it might be a while. https://github.com/outpaddling/freebsd-ports-wip/tree/master/salmon; https://github.com/outpaddling/freebsd-ports-wip/tree/master/pufferfish; https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/502. 1. The cmake system still forces downloading pufferfish during configure, which is forbidden in the ports system (like many other package managers). All downloads must occur during fetch phase and be verified using locally stored checksums. This would be easy to work around using GH_TUPLE, which downloads additional distfiles during fetch phase, except that fetchPufferfish.sh doesn't just extract the pufferfish dist, but has a long list of ""cp"" commands to copy pieces of it to ${INSTALL_DIR}. That's not something I'm inclined to tamper with since it will likely change with new versions and hence be a headache to maintain over time. It would be ideal if salmon could work with a separately installed pufferfish as it does with many other dependencies. This would make the port much cleaner.; 2.

Deployability,"FYI, miniconda works fine on FreeBSD. It's not too difficult to configure manually, but to make it even easier:. As root:. ```; pkg install auto-admin linux-miniconda-installer; auto-install-linux_base; ```; As a non-root user:. ```; miniconda-installer; conda-shell; conda config --add channels conda-forge; conda config --add channels bioconda; conda create -n salmon salmon; ```; Note: Just running `conda install salmon` instead of `conda create -n salmon salmon` will install a very old version rather than the latest. This utilizes the Linux compatibility module, which simply adds Linux system calls to the FreeBSD kernel. Unlike a virtual machine, there's no performance penalty and memory overhead is trivial. In fact, Linux binaries sometimes run slightly faster on FreeBSD than they do on Linux. Average speed is about the same. I'd only use conda as a stop-gap, though. There's a large and growing selection of bioinformatics software in FreeBSD ports that can be more easily installed and used, e.g. 'pkg install samtools bwa'.

It makes sense to have the feature of having the gtf at the time of indexing. The only concern I have is that mandating to have the gtf might restrict the overall workflow by a bit. Specifically because a user might not always have the full GTF available for every use case, although we can always make having GTF as an optional requirement for indexing. Adding the support should not be too difficult but it will certainly add a new logic path which would need thorough testing. . We'll certainly keep you updated with the feature as we progress although it can take some time to get back.

Deployability,"HI @Acribbs ,. Thanks for the very interesting question.; I think the first question in my mind is, do you need intron level deduplicated counts ? If yes, then sadly concatenating the pre-mrna sequence into the transcriptome sequences is probably not a good idea, as in general, the length of intronic sequences are much longer than that of exonic sequence and it may bias alevin deduplication algorithm. However, if you don't need the number of unspliced deduplicated counts and as the nuceli scRNA-seq has more pre-mRNA data if the question is regarding the aligning to genome v transcriptome then we just proposed a solution in our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v1?rss=1).

Deployability,"HI @mfansler ,; Thanks for asking the very important question.; Alevin is primarily (till current release) designed to work with 3'-tagged end, droplet based sequencing where the primary assumption is that most of the reads would ideally be sequenced from the 3'-end of the molecule. Although, Salmon is a transcript quantification tool for *bulk* RNA-seq but we believe in singe-cell (3'-tagged) sequencing, generating quantification at transcript level is fundamentally hard problem to solve. Specifically, one of the reason is, a lot of transcripts share the terminal exon, and the features like length effect which are used in bulk RNA-seq to resolve ambiguity is not directly usable in single-cell for resolving the transcript ambiguity making the problem hard.; It's possible in the future that assays are designed to help incorporate more information e.g. sequencing from both 5' or 3' end sequencing or use SMART-seq2 which sequence the full molecule. In latter case people have been using Salmon as-is for generating the transcript level quantification. . _In summary_: We believe it's a trade-off based on your use case i.e. if you wan't to generate transcript level counts then most-likely single cell protocols which sequence from the full length of the molecules like smart-seq2 is better suited but if the motivation is to get higher number of cell coverage w/ decent gene-level molecule counts that's where 3'-end tagged end sequencing protocols shines most. _One Liner_; Alevin generates only gene-level counts for droplet based sequencing (til latest release v0.11.2).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/287#issuecomment-420627713:98,release,release,98,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/287#issuecomment-420627713,4,['release'],['release']

Deployability,Hard to say - I definitely don't know the code base or algorithm details better than you. The thing that jumps to mind is separation of finding equivalent CBs/quantification and whitelisting. For example:. 1) `salmon alevin --quantifyAll`: could do no whitelisting (knee or otherwise) and output a sparse matrix of counts for all CBs (binning counts by equivalences). 2) `salmon alevin --runQC --rrna path/to/rrna.txt --mrna path/to/mrna.txt path/to/quants_mat.gz`: could just do whitelisting via whatever combination of knee and/or NB modelling on the counts from `1)`. . I think you're much better positioned to know if the above makes sense or is reasonable. One advantage of separating CB mapping/quantification and whitelisting is that it would be relatively straightforward to run automatic cell QC filtering from the output of kallisto or Cell Ranger. There seems to be a definite lack of automation in this area (only other thing I have come across is [`cellity`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cellity.html) which seems to be more hands on).,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/379#issuecomment-503641072:1006,release,release,1006,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/379#issuecomment-503641072,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"Hello @rob-p,. thank you very much for your quick and detailed answer!. > Why are the salmon counts for this gene much lower when using alignment mode and mapping mode under nf-core?. This theory makes perfect sense and would explain the low counts for the short genes perfectly. When I check the bam files, I see quite a few reads that are only partially in the region of the particular feature. ; I looked at the meta_info.json: . ""num_bootstraps"": 0,; ""num_processed"": 36672829,; ""num_mapped"": 27737862,; ""num_decoy_fragments"": 2690181,; ""num_dovetail_fragments"": 59605,; ""num_fragments_filtered_vm"": 2897142,; ""num_alignments_below_threshold_for_mapped_fragments_vm"": 4117684,; ""percent_mapped"": 75.63600288376989,.

I have now run FeatureCounts several times with different overlaps (minOverlap =25, minOverlap =50, minOverlap =75min Overlap =100) and indeed the counts have decreased (again the psbI example: 8685 , 6011, 4237, 1805 accordingly). Again, this is a good argument for the hypothesis put forward. >Why does running Salmon outside nf-core lead to much higher values?. Hopefully, after I run Decoy mode, this problem is solved. I also tried mapping mode with the --softclipOverhangs option. That increased the counts (psbI : 4696 counts); playing around with the --minScoreFraction flag in addition to the --softclipOverhangs flag also increased the numbers ( minScoreFraction= 0 ->psbI = 8496; minScoreFraction= 0.5 ->psbI = 5633; minScoreFraction= 0.7 ->psbI =3627 ). .

Although it should not be too hard to do that. Specifically, the `extractBarcodes` and `extractUMI` function [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/blob/master/src/AlevinUtils.cpp#L44) has to be updated with a new generic type (`celseq` may be).

Salmon stopped producing output on stderr (and sent an EOF marker?) and so my script exited; - killing salmon prematurely; - truncating the salmon index (In a way that salmon found perfectly acceptable during `salmon quant`; - frustrating me quite a bit.

We'll update that message.; Regarding the misplaced newline, the issue is that the other messages are written by the logger, which is asynchronous.

Deployability,"Hi @Beatzekatze,. The issue with test 1 seems to be from CMake being unable to find the unit test to execute under certain configurations. I'll consider this a bug in the CMake file, and look into fixing it. The failure of tests 2 and 3 is more interesting, as one would definitely not expect this given that the program compiled without error. Does indexing fail only with `--type fmd`, or also with `--type quasi` (or no `--type` as that is the default)? Would it be possible to run the command under gdb and report the stack trace? That would be something like:. ```; $ gdb --args salmon index -t transcripts.fasta -i sample_salmon_fmd_index --type fmd; ```. and then, when you encounter the segfault issuing the back-trace `bt` command. This would give insight into where, exactly this is showing up. One issue I've seen before is when the resident installation of Boost is _not_ compiled with `--std=c++11` (or 14 or 17), since this leads to an incompatible ABI between salmon and the Boost library. If that's what's going on, it should be evident from the backtrace.

Deployability,"Hi @ChelseaCHENX ,. Thanks for raising the issue.; I think if you can share the alevin log (say for 1192 cells ?) we can comment much more about the details. However, if you ask me to guess then I believe the initial whitelisting of alevin seems to be predicting a lot less cells, if you check the alevin log, it would say what % of CB are thrown due to noisy cellular barcodes. If the number is `>20%`, then the chances are indeed ""knee"" estimates are shooting up. The way to get better estimates from there would be to help alevin with a ballpark number of cells (as you are giving to cellranger with --expect-cell 8000, you can provide alevin with --expectCells 8000). Even after that if you get a lot of noisy CB prediction then you can force alevin to use certain number of cells with `--forceCells` option. https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/362 this issue might help you understand more the details of the pipeline.; Hope it helps !",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/396#issuecomment-510540540:923,pipeline,pipeline,923,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/396#issuecomment-510540540,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']
Deployability,"Hi @DobbyLikesPenguins,. ### conda idea. So, if you want to try with conda again, I would first recommend that you create a new environment for salmon. ```; conda create --name salmon; ```. which you can then activate with . ```; conda activate salmon; ```. From this environment, you should be able to install the latest version. ```; conda install salmon; ```. or specifying version explicitly like . ```; conda install salmon=1.4.0; ```. ### using the pre-compiled executable. The simplest thing would be to simply add it to your PATH. Assuming you are using bash or a similar shell, you can do something like:. ```; export PATH=<path_to_salmon_directory>/bin:$PATH; ```. to add salmon to your path. It should choose this version when you use `salmon`. However, this will be reset when you logout.

So, the parameters you provide are the mean and standard deviation of the distribution *prior* to truncation. However, I'll note that the values are such that 0 is usually sufficiently far (in terms of standard deviations from the mean) that the mean and standard deviation of the fragment length distribution are very similar before and after the 0 truncation. Finally, I'll mention that, if you have paired-end reads, Salmon will *always* learn the empirical fragment length distribution (since the experiment, itself, is the best estimator of the true distribution), but the `--fldMean` and `--fldSD` parameters define the prior distribution that is updated with observed fragment lengths.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/127#issuecomment-285686442:773,update,updated,773,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/127#issuecomment-285686442,2,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"Hi @FlorianRNA ! As stated in the [usage docs](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.8.1/usage#quantification-options) for the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline:. ""Since v3.0 of the pipeline, featureCounts is no longer used to perform gene/transcript quantification, however it is still used to generate QC metrics based on [biotype](http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/biotypes.html) information available within GFF/GTF genome annotation files. This decision was made primarily because of the limitations of featureCounts to appropriately quantify gene expression data. Please see [Zhao et al., 2015](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141910#pone-0141910-t001) and [Soneson et al., 2015](https://f1000research.com/articles/4-1521/v1)."". This is a common cause of confusion and I have tried to be as explicit about this in the docs. featureCounts is used to quantify features in the annotation by `gene_biotype` and not the actual gene / transcript features themselves. This may explain why you are seeing these discrepancies. However, I am still a little puzzled how you are able to directly compare the counts generated by featureCounts and Salmon (in either mode) because the core features that are being quantified should be different. Where did you get the plant reference genome from? If it's not from Ensembl then it probably isn't worth running the biotype quantification with featureCounts anyway because the GTF annotation files may not contain that information. There are some docs for this [here](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.8.1/usage#prokaryotic-genome-annotations).

Deployability,"Hi @Hoohm , ; Thanks for the quick reply and the explanation . I personally am not very well versed in the working of `SCRBseq`. But, as you explained, knowing a set of whitelist CB beforehand is always a plus for the downstream working of the pipeline. Currently, Alevin merge all the observed CB which are 1-edit distance from a known whitelist CB towards the whitelist. The underlying assumption being that the sequencing error (although with low probability) can change CB sequence and we can correct for that. I wonder, is this right to do for your experiment ?. re: >Is there an option for max distance allowed between BC or UMI?; Sorry, but I don't completely understand this question. When you say distance allowed between CB and UMI, do you mean there is a sequence between CB and UMI ( like in in-drop seq)? If that's the case then we might have to tweak a bit in alevin command line flags again. But I suspect what you meant by above statement is -- max distance allowed between CB among themselves. If that's the question then unfortunately we currently allow correcting for only 1-edit distance for both CB and UMI. But if you think more correction is needed by your protocol then we can put this on the feature request list and discuss about working on this on the next release.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/247#issuecomment-402543751:244,pipeline,pipeline,244,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/247#issuecomment-402543751,2,"['pipeline', 'release']","['pipeline', 'release']"

The relevant options here are: `--fldMean` which you can use to specify the expected mean length of the fragment distribution and `--fldSD` which you can use to specify the expected standard deviation of the fragment length distribution. These values are used to set the _prior_ on the fragment length distribution. This means that if you're using paired-end reads, the observations will overwhelm this prior quickly and we'll learn the empirical distribution. If you're using single-end data, then the prior won't really be updated and the values you specify above are what will be used in practice (e.g. to compute effective transcript lengths).

Deployability,"Hi @Munfred , ; Thanks again for testing Alevin with your dataset. Extrapolating from the log, It indeed looks like a challenging dataset. In default settings Alevin pipeline starts with finding a knee in the curve (which itself is a non-trivial problem) and then use KDE w/ gaussian correction to adjust for the right probability. In your case it looks like knee is overshooting (if true number of CB is 300 ) but more troubling part for me is gaussian correction is coming out 0. Now based on your motivation for using Alevin, I can propose two solutions:. 1. If the motivation is to get gene-level count without worrying about the whitelisted CB prediction then the easiest way is to use external whitelist. Alevin can use external whitelist using flag `--whitelist` and would generate gene level counts for specified list of CB.; 2. If you need full end-to-end run of Alevin, then I propose using command line flag `--dumpFeatures` along with Alevin default. This flag tells Alevin to dump various features, the important one here would be a file named `frequency.txt`, what this file basically tells you is the frequency of all the observed CB in a order. From there we can manually select a knee in the frequency curve and use that as a whitelist. In terms of improving the task for improving the knee selection in Alevin, if you can share the `frequency.txt` file then I can look into what's causing the issue for gaussian correction or the knee selection itself.

Deployability,"Hi @PeteHaitch ,; Thanks for your interest in *Alevin*.; Although in current Alevin we have concentrated mainly on learning more about Droplet based 3'-tagged single cell protocols, especially 10x; we are very much interested in extending it towards other protocols like CEL-seq.; However, there are couple of challenges/difference which should be considered before incorporating it into the Alevin pipeline. Currently Alevin relies on the fact that the droplet based protocols use PCR amplification of the library and the UMI deduplication phase of Alevin assumes an exponential model, I am not sure how true is this with CEL-seq? Another issue is that CEL-seq is a Fluidigm based system while the current application for Alevin is for microfluidics based. In general we have observed that the 10x cell isolation step is pretty robust in reporting the Cellular Barcodes(CB) and although we have a probabilisitic model to handle the CB based uncertainty but the ambiguous case like that are very less frequent, (although not true for Drop-Seq). Having said that, we might have to do some analysis to actually figure out the right model for Barcode correction in Fluidigm based system.

The short answer is that the `--eqclasses` option (which is different from the `--dumpEq` option) is designed, as you suggest, to allow using a pre-computed set of equivalence classes for quantification (thus bypassing the need to read in and parse alignments from a BAM file, or to read in and selectively-align reads from a FASTQ file). This, of course, requires the equivalence classes to have already been constructed and dumped in the proper format (see the `--dumpEq` option mentioned above). Finally, I'll mention that with a quick search through the [documentation at ReadTheDocs](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html), I couldn't find our current description of the `--eqclasses` option (which I'd like to update).

Deployability,"Hi @Zhuxitong, . You can easily change the k-mer length used for indexing by passing the desired value to the `-k` option of the `index` command. So, that part isn't technically a problem. The bigger issue is that Ribo-seq data doesn't follow the same basic model as RNA-seq data. That is, the coverage variation in RNA-seq is more often an issue to be corrected (e.g. evidence of bias during library prep / sequencing), whereas it is integral to the interpretation of Ribo-seq data (i.e. the peaks are primary features of interest). Therefore, it's not clear to me that using any RNA-seq abundance estimation software on Ribo-seq data ""off-the-shelf"" is conceptually the right thing to do, though you are welcome to experiment with it. However, there is some interesting work on combining transcript abundance profiles with Ribo-seq data to infer isoform-level information in the Ribo-seq data. For example, [this recent pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/582031v3) provides a pipeline for this.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/454#issuecomment-557558554:994,pipeline,pipeline,994,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/454#issuecomment-557558554,2,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Can you grep for it. The string must match exactly (version number and all). The gff-based parser to do the transcript to gene mapping is quite picky, as gff & gtf files are often quite ill-formed. My top suggestion would be to do transcript -> gene abundance aggregation using [tximport](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html). The other option is to provide Salmon with a TSV mapping the transcripts to genes, as this eliminates all of the parsing problems (at the cost of pawning them off on the user, who must parse the questionable gtf file).

Deployability,"Hi @amitpande74 ,. May be you are already aware of this but just to make it clear, the idea behind decoy indexing is to ""exclude"" those sequences from the transcriptome quantification and that's why you don't see the indexed transposon sequence in the salmon output. The motivation behind such indexing is to remove false mapping reads i.e. exclude RNA-seq reads from the quantification pipelines which maps better to the decoy sequences compared to the provided transcriptome. . I hope that clarifies your doubt and if you wan't to quantify GFP sequences then you have to concatenate them with the transcriptome sequence ""not"" the decoy sequence, although I just wanted to give you heads up that this analysis goes into an unexplored territory as we personally have not explored such use cases.

Deployability,"Hi @biozzq,. Sure; let me try and explain the likely causes of these observations:. > I had a similar problem, however, I reassemblied the new isoforms using the Hisat2+Stringtie pipeline. The mapping rate from Hisat is 96.49% but it is 65.39% in Salmon. . The mapping rate of Hisat2 is the total number of reads assigned by Hisat2 both to the annotated transcriptome (what will be alignable to a transcript by salmon) as well as to the genome. It is quite common that the mapping rate to the genome is higher than that to the transcriptome. This is much more a result of what you are aligning _to_ than the aligner. If you were to take the transcriptome, and align to it using Hisat2 with `--no-spliced-alignment` and `--end-to-end` (since there won't be splice junctions when you align to the transcriptome), I'd expect you to get a similar mapping rate as you see in salmon. > I also noticed a high number of mappings discarded because of alignment score. I also wonder why the number of mappings discarded can be larger than num of processed (57113760, the reads number in 1_1.fq.gz). . Good question. The number you are looking at is the number of discarded _mappings_, not the number of discarded _fragments_. The difference is that every fragment can have many potential mappings. The number you are looking at is the total number of attempted _alignments_ that failed to achieve the threshold score. Luckily, salmon reports both numbers. The number of fragments for which _all_ alignments failed to reach the score threshold is `4,196,417`; given in `aux_info.json` by ` ""num_fragments_filtered_vm"": 4196417`. One point to note is that these are all fragments for which mapping is attempted (they had at least one k-mer match the reference), but no alignment was valid up to the threshold. You could try running the quantification again with `--softclip` to allow softclipping of the reads and see if any considerable fraction of these `4196417` failed to align because they overhang the annot",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/533#issuecomment-697125235:179,pipeline,pipeline,179,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/533#issuecomment-697125235,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"Hi @bsipos,. This is caused primarily by salmon's desire to apply an error model (by default) to the CIGAR strings. For secondary alignments, as you note, minmap2 doesn't write the read string, and so when salmon is trying to score the alignments under the error model, it can't find the relevant characters in the read. In general, it's not clear to me if one would actually want to apply the error model (designed primarily for short reads) when quantifying long reads (this is something we are currently testing in the lab). For the time being, I'd probably recommend disabling the error model when quantifying alignments from long reads (`--noErrorModel`). In that case, the errors should hopefully go away.

Deployability,"Hi @charlesfoster,. Thanks for opening the issue. The second run looks like it ends before there is any information about mapped reads. Have mappings started to be reported at that point? I wonder if there is some issue related to the loading of the index. I have a few suggestions that may be worthwhile to try:. 1) Do you observe the same problem if you index only the transcriptome (i.e. if you don't also include the genome as a decoy)?. 2) If you are using nfcore/rnaseq you can also consider using the STAR => salmon path. Of course, I'm interested in addressing whatever the underlying issue here is anyway, but it's worth noting that this may be a viable alternative to allow you to process all of these samples using the nfcore pipeline in the meantime. This will align the reads to the genome using STAR (which gives the benefit of having a full decoy), project them to the transcriptome, and then quantify them. Also, if you can share a set of problematic reads (or even a subset of them that will reproduce the extreme slowness problem) privately, that would be very helpful in debugging. In addition to trying to debug what's going on here, I'd probably also try running them through [piscem](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/piscem).

Deployability,"Hi @cljacobs,. Ok, so I figured it out and just pushed a fix to develop. The problem is the following. The `--genes` flag was only recently added to quant merge (actually, via a pull request). The problem is that while, in transcript-level `quant.sf` files, the `Length` field is always an integer, in gene-level `quant.genes.sf` files, the `Length` field can actually be a floating point number (because the gene length is the abundance weighted combination of transcript lengths). So the problem is that the code was parsing length as a `uint32_t`, which is right for transcript-level files but wrong for gene-level files (where it should be a `double`). This caused the parsing to fail when aggregating gene-level files in your example data. As I said, I pushed a fix to develop, and this will make it into the next release.

Specifically, you should explicitly provide `--keepCBFraction 1.0` and a tgMap file (even if it is just a trivial one mapping each feature to itself). @k3yavi can elaborate further if I've overlooked anything. --Rob",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/670#issuecomment-860704025:92,release,release,92,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/670#issuecomment-860704025,2,['release'],['release']
Deployability,"Hi @cwarden45 ,. So `--whitelist` flag is not intended to consume the 737k list of CB you are providing, that's why the error. Thanks for the issue in the doc, I updated it. Idea behind the flag is to externally provide a list of high confidence barcodes potentially identified by different tools like Cellranger, and quantify *only* those barcodes. One use case would be to take the output file `barcodes.tsv` of the cellranger and provide it to flag and quantify only those barcodes. Briefly, alevin doesn't use the 737k list of barcodes at all, it identifies barcodes empirically. If you'd like to quantify using the 737k list of barcodes, checkout the next generation of alevin tool, called [alevin-fry](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/682#issuecomment-877325227:162,update,updated,162,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/682#issuecomment-877325227,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"Hi @dritoshi ,. As per your request I've added the support for Quartz-seq2 data in the alevin framework with https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/commit/f6905b1d1dc6cf6bc4597927ad3be637ba615c9a and should be available with next salmon release.

Currently I just have on flag i.e. quartzseq2 which assumes 15 length CB and 8 length UMI. Unfortunately adding multiple versioned is gonna be little complicated as I might have to discuss with the alevin team and that might take some time. As you can check through the new code through the commit (linked above) adding just the Rule of new protocol is not enough and we might have to add some helper code with each new protocol which increases the redundancy in the code. Currently we are in the process of figuring out a better way to handle new protocols.; Having said that it should not stop users from using alevin with previous version of quartzseq2, you can use the following command line triplet as `--end 5 --barcodeLength 14 --umiLength 8` along with you other alevin flag and it's gonna behave just like `QuartzSeq2v31` you specified above.

Because salmon makes use of a statistical inference procedure to determine the ultimate allocations of reads to transcripts, you cannot just count up the reads ""mapped"" to a transcript to obtain the count you see in the `quant.sf` file. Rather, when you see a read mapped to a transcript in the SAM/BAM file, you should interpret this as the read _could_ be assigned (most likely proportionally) to the transcript. The `--writeMappings` option is primarily intended for the mode where `salmon` performs the mapping itself, rather than the mode where aligned reads are provided as input.

Even those these never garner counts, the `lib_format_counts.json` file was generated by enumerating all possible library type codes, which is why you see more than 12 different library formats even though there are only 12 valid formats. The other issue was that, though the encoding was right internally, I was writing out single end, stranded, forward reads as 'F' and single end, stranded, reverse reads as 'R' when these should be 'SF' and 'SR'.

Deployability,"Hi @gresteban,. Yes, here's what's happening. Salmon's aggregation strategy is to collect the transcript-level abundances and then aggregate them to the gene level (this means summing the counts / TPMs, and doing an abundance weighted combination of the lengths / effective lengths). If there is no gene annotated for a transcript, than Salmon's behavior is to treat this transcript as it's own (single isoform) gene, and the gene name should be the name of this transcript. This is to retain the totality of the originally computed expression (i.e. the gene level results will have the same total read count and TPM as the transcript level results). I realize that this default behavior may not be a one-size-fits-all solution. If you have a suggestion for a different way to handle this, I'd be happy to hear it. I'll double check the code, but I believe the reason you're only seeing the warning show up once is that Salmon reports the warning the first time it sees such an occurrence, but not thereafter. That's sort of confusing default behavior, so I'll fix that up anyway. Also, I should mention that, generally, I now recommend that people use [tximport](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html) for transcript to gene level aggregation. Within a single sample, it's default strategy is equivalent to what Salmon does. However, it has some nice extra features, like the ability to do transcript -> gene aggregation across multiple samples while accounting for the variation in the effective gene length (abundance weighted average of isoform lengths) across samples.

Deployability,"Hi @gringer,. Yes, we can add a section for this in the docs. It will replace the old way for specifying geometry soon, as its just easier and more flexible. We talk about it in the 1.4.0 release notes. I copy the relevant info below (@k3yavi pulled for the 1-based indexing and won out ... this time):. generic barcode / umi / read geometry syntax : Alevin learned to support a generic syntax to specify the read sequence that should be used for barcodes, UMIs and the read sequence. The syntax allows one to specify how the pattern corresponding to the barcode, UMI, and read sequence should be pieced together, and the syntax is meant to be intuitive and general. For example, one can specify the 10Xv2 geometry in the following manner using the generic syntax:. --read-geometry 2[1-end] --bc-geometry 1[1-16] --umi-geometry 1[17-26]. This specifies that the ""sequence"" read (the biological sequence to be aligned) comes from read 2, and it spans from the first index 1 (this syntax used 1-based indexing) until the end of the read. Likewise, the barcode derives from read 1 and occupies positions 1-16, and the UMI comes from read 1 and occupies positions 17-26. The syntax can specify multiple ranges, and they will simply be concatenated together to produce the string. For example, one could specify --bc-geometry 1[1-8,16-23] to designate that the barcode should be taken from the substring in positions 1-8 of read 1 followed by the substring in positions 16-23 of read 1. It is even possible to have the string pieced together across both reads, but that functionality is only available if you are running with --rad or --sketch and preparing a RAD file for alevin-fry. If you are running classic alevin, the barcode must reside on a single read. The robust parsing of the flexible geometry syntax is made possible by the cpp-peglib project.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/445#issuecomment-777884823:188,release,release,188,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/445#issuecomment-777884823,2,['release'],['release']

(1) The motivation behind asking users to use Bioconda to install the binary is to limit the number of variables we may encounter when someone is reporting a bug --- i.e. if there are fewer distribution channels there is less maintenance overhead. Nonetheless, as you can see, I've had to make the binary available anyway, because it was the only way some people could easily get the program.

Deployability,"Hi @jan-g1,. The length of a feature is used during inference to determine the likelihood that multimapping reads should be allocated to different targets. You're describing what is essentially a simplified model where P(f | t) (i.e., the probability of a fragment given a transcript) is independent of length(t). There's currently no option to disable length normalization completely in Salmon, and you can't ""de-normalize"" by simply multiplying by a factor because those weights are considered during each and every round of the EM (or VBEM) algorithm. However, supporting this should actually be very straight-forward. We simply assign a uniform and identical length to all transcripts for the purpose of inference. I can add such a flag in the next release, though it will initially have to be incompatible with bias correction (since it's not clear right now how the biases for which we account interact with this type of sequencing). Also, it would be possible to run salmon with `--dumpEq`, and then to have a little script / tool that simply re-runs the EM, but without different length factors, using the equivalence class file.

Deployability,"Hi @jasonvrogers,. First of all thank you so much for sharing this thorough analysis with us, it was very clear and helpful for understanding the details of the problem you are referring to. Secondly, I apologize for the long time it took me to get back at you. I would like you to know that we have been and are still working on possible solutions for addressing this problem, and here I would like to share some updates with you. . About the success cases, it was nice to know that the current model of Salmon with length correction works pretty well in recovering the right estimates for those ""easier"" cases where one transcript is fully contained in another one. Turning off the length correction, tells the Salmon model not to consider the effective length of each transcript for computing the conditional probabilities of originating a fragment from a transcript. So, for the RNA-seq data there is no reason to turn off this term of the model, and we highly recommend not to use that flag for the bulk RNA-seq abundance estimation with Salmon. Looking more carefully at the 2nd case you have posted as the failure case, it is interesting to see that there is a very nice visual evidence on the super transcript that the long transcript might not be expressed at all. I am referring to the zero coverage regions on the Super Transcript between the regions corresponding to the smaller transcripts, e. g., between POF1 and EMC1. So, we tried a solution that inspects the coverage profile of all transcripts and calculates the probability of observing a zero coverage region on each transcript. If this probability is too low, this would be counted as an evidence for a transcript not being expressed at all.

I've just pushed a fix that should allow parsing of (well-formated) files that end in any of {.gtf, .GTF, .gff, .GFF, .gff3, .GFF3}. Furthermore, going over the relevant bug revealed a latent potential bug that could pop up when there was a transcript in the salmon index that was absent from the GTF/GFF file. So this commit fixes this as well.

The reason for this that when selectively aligning the reads, salmon writes in the SAM file the length of each transcript as retained in the index. This is the length the transcript has after the basic pre-processing, which includes clipping polyA tails. Thus, the length will not always precisely match the input fasta file.

Deployability,"Hi @jeremymsimon, to answer your last question:. > As for the barcode detection - my usual approach with alevin at least is to let it try to estimate a ""real"" cell number, but if it's way off from our experimental expectations, to inject --expectCells ncells and let that serve as a starting point (with subsequent filtering). That has worked reasonably well in the past for me , and seems to be an option for alevin-fry as well. I don't know whether that is poor practice in the long run...it came from a place of seeing far too many weak knee plots early in the droplet scRNA-seq days. Are you generally more trusting of these estimates these days?. So one of the nice aspects of the alevin to alevin-fry pipeline is that it's relatively easy to try different filtering approaches since the initial mapping process only has to happen once. In general, the knee detection method is pretty good, and often gives a reasonable cell count. However, this isn't always the case. What we find in the alevin-fry pre-print is that it tends to be slightly more conservative than if you did e.g. unfiltered quantification followed by filtering with something like `DropletUtils` (but usually only slightly). The knee method is basically the iterative knee finding procedure from UMI-tools, with some slight tweaks to the parameters. However, unlike alevin, alevin-fry also supports unfiltered quantification. In this case, you provide an `unfiltered-permitlist`, which is a set of acceptable barcodes (not necessarily all expected to be present), and alevin-fry will correct against this. This will tend to produce a _lot_ of quantified cells, since we quantify any barcode matching 10 or more reads (by default, this value is modifiable on the command line). So, such unfiltered matrices definitely need to be filtered after quantification. However, for protocols with an external permit list, or those where you can reasonably derive a list of potential expected barcodes, it's less stringent and therefore po",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-988967759:707,pipeline,pipeline,707,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-988967759,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']
Deployability,"Hi @jeremymsimon,. A few quick thoughts on this.; ; > -Is quantification via alevin-fry (rather than alevin itself) mandatory here? I ask since your run seems successful whereas my full alevin run had a very poor BC detection and mapping rate.; ; I don't think we've been able to successfully obtain the same concordance with alevin yet (as opposed to alevin-fry). There is more sophisticated _internal_ barcode logic going on there, and we may need to pull @k3yavi in to see what is happening outside of the RAD -> fry pipeline.; ; > -I see you specified -l A - can you comment on what the detected/correct library type was here?; ; Unlike `alevin`, when you run with in `--rad` or `--sketch` mode, the library type isn't really relevant. All mappings are passed through to the rad file. Subsequently, in `alevin-fry` there is a `-d` (direction) flag that is used to filter mappings that don't concord with the expected orientation. I'm not sure what @Gaura used in the run above — the default is to keep reads from either orientation.; ; > -I assume all of this will also work in conjunction with --expectCells or --keepCBFraction if those parameters were needed? Your ~7k cells detected is very close to the published number post-filtering, but no similar filtering has been done here yet. My guess is that the proportion of cells that pass these filters will be higher for alevin, but we may still be under-estimating the number of real cells by a little bit here.; ; According to the commands listed, @Gaura used `alevin-fry`'s built-in knee-like filtering. This tries to use a knee on the cumulative read count histogram to determine a good cutoff for ""reliable"" cells versus poor quality cells. Alternatively, one can provide an external permit list with `-u` (unfiltered permit list) to quantify all cells that match any known barcode. This will generally result in *many* more quantified cells, which you will then want to filter post-quantification.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-988011633:520,pipeline,pipeline,520,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-988011633,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"Hi @k3yavi,; Many thanks for you prompt answer, once again. >When you say you try subsampling the Fastq, did you sample randomly across the full Fastq or chose the top X reads. Yes, I did perform a random subsampling, ie. taking a read with a p probability while reading the fastq files, p being the subsampling coefficient I did mention (pE[0;1]). An implementation of this approach as an option during the transcript quantification would be great. I can provide you with the simple python script I use for the subsampling, but I am not sure if it is the proper way to subsample during alevin quantification. >when you say cellranger subsampling, do you mean the cellranger aggregate pipeline?. Yes, sorry for not clearly stating it. I did use the cellranger aggregate function indeed, which by default subsample the expression matrices with high sequencing depth depending on amount of mapped reads, if I understand well. >Use Alevin w/o any modification to the fastq on both of your sample to generate the gene count matrices. I already did that, in downstream analyses I have a batch effect issue related to the sequencing depth. >that's why we recommend using the Seurat package downstream of the Alevin quantified matrices. I have some experience with downstream analyses with Seurat, Pagoda, Scater, scanpy and a few other tools, and I am aware of batch correction methods like CCA or MNN. But that is not what I am looking for here. I did both CCA and MNN but I loose some important information in the resulting eigenspaces or corrected matrix. I believe the proper way to correct my batch effect is to simply fix the difference between my two libraries, ie. the sequencing depth in this case. As I explained in my first message, cellranger aggregate (subsampling based on the amount of mapped reads) works very well in my case, correct the effect without any loss or modification of important genes in our scientific question.

Deployability,"Hi @kate-simonova,. While I would certainly recommend updating to the latest version of salmon (which, given the pre 1.0.0 to post 1.0.0 difference would require you to rebuild the index), I don't think that would have a substantial effect on a mapping rate that is this low. If the Fastqscreen report suggests that most of the reads map to the genome (>75%), but you are seeing an 8% mapping rate in salmon, this highly suggests that most of the reads are, for some reason, arising from outside of an annotated gene. I would then have two suggestions to test out:. 1.) Check for mtRNA contamination. Try adding extra mitochondrial RNA to your reference fasta, re-indexing, and re-quantifying. If mtRNA depletion or polyA enrichment failed, then it's possible that you have most of your RNA-seq reads coming from mt genes. I've seen this before a number of times and it results in a situation where most of the reads map back to the genome — but not the annotated transcriptome, which often has an incomplete set of mtRNA sequences. 2.) Try mapping the reads to the genome and see how many reads overlap known genes. This is what you would do with a ""counting-based"" RNA-seq pipeline, so something like STAR+feature-counts or subread+feature-counts. While I would generally not recommend this for quantification, it can be instructive to see the fraction of reads that map to the genome but not to known transcripts. Likewise, you could (with the newest salmon) build an index on the transcriptome with the genome added as a decoy (see about our decoy-aware indexing), then the `meta_info.json` will let you know the fraction of reads that were discarded because they were best matched to a decoy sequence (in this case, the genome, but not some annotated transcript). This should help clarify what's going on, and might suggest some issues with the sample that are preventing a reasonable mapping rate to the annotated transcriptome.

Deployability,"Hi @lauraht,. Sure; let me answer these in order. (1) Salmon does not really make use of the read id (we assume the fasta files are synchronized in the input). The one place that not using the `-l` option might raise a complication is if you wish to dump the mappings and examine them (using `--writeMappings`), in which case it will be difficult in the SAM file to discern which read is which just from the names (though the flags should still be valid). (2) Yes, this is normal and expected behavior. Since the online phase of salmon is asynchronous, the online updates may arrive in a slightly different order. This can lead to a slightly different starting condition for the offline phase and, subsequently, small differences in the abundances. However, these differences are generally small and are _inherent_ to the uncertainty in the inference itself. That is, the estimates have inherent uncertainty that is greater than the variation you might see between runs. To assess this you can (and, perhaps should) estimate this uncertainty by asking salmon to draw inferential samples (e.g. Gibbs samples with `--numGibbsSamples`). Best,; Rob. P.S. As a general note, I'd recommending upgrading to the latest version of salmon. We update salmon quite regularly with both small and large improvements (and bug fixes where relevant).

Deployability,"Hi @leagleag,. Thank you for your question. This is because with selective alignment (`--validateMappings`) salmon is making use of [range-factorized equivalence classes](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i142/3953977), which do not directly correspond to the ""standard"" notion of equivalence classes. In fact, as of the next release, it will _always_ make use of these equivalence classes by default. This leads to potentially confusing results when used in conjunction with `--dumpEq`. Specifically, the range-factorized equivalence relation group fragments not only by the transcripts to which they map, but also with respect to the conditional probabilities of having generated that fragment & alignment score given each transcript. Practically, what happens is that the space of conditional probabilities is quantized, and an equivalence relation is defined based on both the transcript set and the vector of conditional probability bins into which the mapping falls with respect to each transcript in the equivalence class. This means that range-factorized equivalence classes can have multiple classes of fragments that map to the same set of transcripts, but with different conditional probabilities. Additionally, for each bin, the average conditional probability of fragments arising from that bin is maintained. What you are seeing printed out are the transcript sets, followed by the conditional bin indexes. Starting in the next release (and currently in the develop branch), we've cleaned up the interaction of the range-factorized equivalence classes with the `--dumpEq` and `--dumpEqWeights` flags. If you run with the `--dumpEqWeights` flags, salmon will dump the transcript sets, followed by the conditional probability vector, followed by the fragment count. If you run with the `--dumpEq` flag, it will collapse all of the range-factorized equivalence classes into ""simple"" equivalence classes by combining classes with the same transcript set (but different co",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/402#issuecomment-517041654:346,release,release,346,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/402#issuecomment-517041654,2,['release'],['release']

Somehow, Gmail has decided that all GitHub notifications (except those that explicitly tag me, but somehow I missed this one) should go to SPAM. So, I've been missing some of the newer issues here. The short answer is that the documentation needs to be updated. When salmon was originally published, we made use of [RapMap](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/RapMap) as the underlying mapper, which performed quasi-mapping against an index that consisted of a suffix array and a hash over k-mers pointing to prefixes in the suffix array (similar to the strategy used by STAR, but using much longer k-mers to improve lookup speed). We referred to this index as the quasi-index. As the software evolved and we continued to improve the mapping methodology, we eventually transitioned over to an index based on [our pufferfish data structure](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish). In addition to the new data structure, this coincided with our move over to selective-alignment as the mapping algorithm, and all of this happened at the 1.0.0 release (this is why, for example, indices built before 1.0.0 are not compatible with salmon > 1.0.0; a topic on which there have been a few GitHub issues). However, given the fact that the documentation and software are linked only through manual human intervention (we haven't leveled up to e.g. having salmon be a [literate program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) yet), these two sometimes get out of sync. This is an instance of that. We have maintained the functionality of the `--writeMappings` feature, and in fact, even augmented it. However, we have not replaced the antiquated `quasi-index` terminology in the documentation. The TLDR is that you can use `--writeMappings` with the index you built with the `salmon index` command, and it should work fine. If you are mapping against an index without decoy sequences, then the output format will be basically ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/727#issuecomment-996192524:327,update,updated,327,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/727#issuecomment-996192524,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"Hi @mr-c,. First of all, **thank you** for your monumental effort in supporting salmon as a Debian package. I think this is fantastic. I'm also not a CMake expert, but I've failed with it enough times to start to get a handle. I have actually moved to the latest version of Jellyfish (v2.2.3) in the [quasimapping branch](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/quasimapping), which will be merged back into master as soon as we've finished porting the bootstrapping feature from [sailfish-master](https://github.com/kingsfordgroup/sailfish). Regarding supporting external versions of the libraries — this absolutely makes sense. What is the standard location where they are assumed to be installed? In this case I can search with a `FindPackage` before I attempt to download them. From the list above, I see two potential problem libraries:; - bwa — We actually use a modified version of bwa that accepts and uses an extra parameter that specifies the suffix array sampling frequency. Specifically, we, by default, use a denser sampling of the suffix array to trade off extra space usage for more speed in lookup. The standard bwa, therefore, probably wouldn't work.; - jellyfish — I actually tried to use jellyfish without obtaining the source and building it early on in development. I ran into an issue where the config.h file generated during compile wasn't installed by Jellyfish, and this caused runtime failures when Salmon was running. It seems to me that either (1) config.h should be installed with jellyfish by default or (2) it shouldn't be necessary to use jellyfish as a library. However, as far as I know, this issue persists in the latest version of jellyfish (if you want to use it as a library as we do, and not just as a k-mer counter).

Deployability,"Hi @nh13,. This is not something for which we currently have support or something that we currently plan. I'd be open to it, but I'm honestly not sure how to cleanly do it in the current architecture, and doing so would certainly incur a performance hit. Salmon runs 2 phases of inference; and online phase and an offline phase. The online phase has access to _fragment-level_ information that is then summarized away during the offline phase (like the specific locations of each read, the length of each observed fragment, etc.). That information goes away when the reads are summarized into range-factorized equivalence classes. Moreover, some of the model parameters learned during the online phase will depend (in their details) on the order in which observations are made. Ostensibly, observing the same data in the same order **and issuing updates to shared model parameters from worker threads in the same order** should result in identical values, however this has never been tested and was never a design goal. The reason for this is that differences between runs are within the bounds of the inherent inferential uncertainty of the estimated parameters anyway. That is, if one is relying on a specific value at a level of precision such that a different run of salmon would produce a value different enough to change a downstream analysis, then one is imparting more precision on the estimates than they can provide. Other methods that produce identical results between runs for these values may produce the same output, but the accuracy of the output at that level shouldn't be trusted in this case. The uncertainty of the parameter estimates can be evaluated based on the Gibb samples (or bootstrap replicates) that salmon computes. Of course, the small differences between runs rarely lead to differences in downstream analysis (almost certainly at the gene level and also at the transcript level if you use a differential testing method that is aware of inferential uncertainty).

Deployability,"Hi @nskbe,. The issue you're seeing with the mapping file name is related to this note in the release notes:. > Note: In the 0.7.2 release, the file provided to --writeMappings must use a qualified path (e.g. --writeMappings=./out.sam rather than --writeMappings=out.sam), this constraint is already addressed on develop and will be fixed in the next release. . Essentially, the code should internally qualify the filepath before checking if a directory exists, but it doesn't. The fix for this is to pass the file name as a qualified path (i.e. adding `./` before the file name when you want it in the current directory). This is already resolved in develop and the fix for this annoyance will make it into the next release. Regarding the issue with writing the information to `stdout`; actually, all of the logging messages are written to `stderr`. If you don't redirect `stdout`, then you'll see everything, but the intended usage for that mode is something like:. ```; salmon quant -i idx [other options] --writeMappings > out.sam; ```. This will redirect standard out to out.sam. You'll still see the logging messages on the console, since they are written to `stderr`, but all of the mapping contents are redirected to the file.

Deployability,"Hi @qifei9,. Thanks for the question and for pointing out the need for update in the docs. Regarding your first question, both approaches (3) and (2) seem reasonable to me. I would *not* try approach (1) as this will eliminate the benefit of the stranded library for the targets where you do know the orientation. For approach (2) , I'd either use `--validateMappings` or at least set `--rangeFactorizationBins 4` (the former implies the latter). As for what value to set for `--incompatPrior`, the effect should be reasonably robust across a range of values, the question is how unlikely _a priori_ would you expect a mapping not in `ISR` orientation to be if you also observed a mapping in `ISR` ... probably very unlikely (you could try e.g. 1e-10 or some such). Approach 3 is also also reasonable, though what you might consider doing is looking at the abundances for these opposite strands of the same sequence post quantification --- you should generally see that one of the two has a non-zero expression, or at least one orientation should have a much higher expression than the other (for expressed transcripts, at least, this might give you evidence as to the true strand of origin).

Deployability,"Hi @rahulnutron,. Currently, the recommendation is to move to [`alevin-fry`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry). If you don't have a good annotation (i.e. transcripts as well as introns) then you can index just the transcriptome as normal. The big differences are that, rather than letting alevin do the quantification, you would ask `salmon alevin` to just a do the mapping phase and produce a rad file. This can be done with (assuming chromium v3 chemistry): . ```; salmon alevin -i <index> --chromiumV3 -l A -1 <reads1> -2 <reads2> -p 16 -o <outdir> --sketch; ```. note that with the `alevin-fry` pipeline, there is no need to provide the t2g map at this phase (it's used later).

Deployability,"Hi @ramezrawas,. Can you say precisely what you mean by reproducible? Do you mean that the values in the .sf file are not identical? If so, this is expected behavior. It exists for a number of reasons. The big one is that the initial phase of salmon uses an online inference algorithm so that specific details of the solution are dependent on the order in which the reads are processed (which is random given that multiple threads parse reads and update estimates asynchronously). However, the more important point here is that the inference estimates returned by Salmon (and, for that matter, every other transcript-level expression tool) are the result of a statistical optimization procedure that cannot guarantee a unique global optimal solution (and, in fact, even if a global optimum could be guaranteed, there may be multiple different optima). Thus, there is uncertainty inherent in the statistical problem being solved. Of course, if one ordered updates in the same way and set up the initial conditions precisely the same, there would be convergence to the same result, but any sense of confidence there is illusory. However, Salmon does provide a way to quantify, statistically, confidence in the result. The `--numBootstraps` option will do bootstrap sampling, or the `--numGibbsSamples` option will perform posterior Gibbs sampling. Both of these techniques will provide samples from the posterior distribution, and the variance of these samples will give you some information about the variance in the results that are due purely to the inherent statistical uncertainty in the problem. In the `scripts` folder there is a python script `ConvertBootstrapsToTSV.py` that will convert either the bootstrap or gibbs samples to a easily readable tsv format. These samples represent the estimated number of reads coming from each transcript when sampling from the posterior. These can be used to empirically estimate that statistical uncertainty in the abundance estimates of the different tran",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/102#issuecomment-259464248:447,update,update,447,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/102#issuecomment-259464248,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"Hi @red-plant,. So, I have some update from our end. @mohsenzakeri dug into the data a bit (specifically `SRR7985407`). What he found is that there are a considerable number of reads (~13%) have long stretches of polyA or polyT that are matching in a hyper-repetitive manner internally within a certain set of transcripts (i.e. these are not matching polyA tails, because those are already trimmed). These matches are, obviously, minimally informative, but we had not special-cased ignoring them yet. Specifically, what seems to be prevalent in these reads are read pairs where one read has polyA, the other has polyT, and the keep matching to the same positions. However, the rest of the reads don't match the transcript, so a bunch of time is wasted on validating (and discarding) these mappings. To test this hypothesis, we made a small change to the mapping algorithm to special case and ignore k-mers that are purely homopolymers. I'll note that in this data, this has no effect on the mapping rate. I get the following performance profile running the trimmed version of this data (having trimmed with `fastp`) using 4 threads, and _without_ the additional `--hitFilterPolicy BOTH` flag. ```; 1306.86user 4.79system 4:42.54elapsed 464%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 592704maxresident)k; ```. I was wondering if you might test this altered version out and see if it has a similarly beneficial effect for you as well. Probably, the time will be different, since the processors themselves are, and since I elided all non-essential flags here, but I would hope this version is faster than the current (even with the altered `hitFilterPolicy`).

Deployability,"Hi @rekado,. I would absolutely be willing to accept such a patch, and this is a good idea! However, as I mention in issue #102, there is a _small_, inherent, non-determinism in the program, even if random seeds are all set identically. This is due to the streaming nature of the first phase of the algorithm (i.e., the online phase). Specifically, the initial, online abundance estimates, as well as the parameters of some of the experimental and bias models, can be affected by the order in which reads are observed / processed, which is asynchronous and non-deterministic. As I mention in #102, deviations are expected to be _very small_, and any differences encountered due to this are smaller than the inherent uncertainty in inference. I think that allowing to remove all controllable sources of non-determinism (e.g. random number generator seeds) is a great idea, and we should do it.

Deployability,"Hi @rekado,. The order is determined based on how work is pulled from a queue. Specifically, the way quantification works in the first phase is that independent threads pull reads to be processed from a lock-free concurrent queue [e.g. here for paired-end reads](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/blob/master/src/SalmonQuantify.cpp#L981). This queue is filled in by parsing threads (e.g. [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/blob/master/src/FastxParser.cpp#L151)). This is the major source of stochasticity. One other source is that once reads are pulled from the queue, they are mapped and then their contribution to the quantifications is processed in [this function](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/blob/master/src/SalmonQuantify.cpp#L165) which, itself, calls update functions to a few classes that are potentially being updated by many threads.

In our experiments, we find that, in expectation, the 10x generated experiments are clean enough that we don't need the 10x whitelisted barcode to be explicitly specified or used. > And do you recommend using the `--naiveEqclass` only 64 guide sequences as features ?. That's a very good question. Basically the answer lies in how complicated the UMI graph network is. Experiment with the antibody derived barcodes (ADT) with 20 protein panel, generally, doesn't need the `--naiveEqclass` mode UMI deduplication, unless the experiment is super deeply sequenced. However, for super low diversity like 4-8 barcodes e.g. for HTO like sample barcodes, the graphical network becomes exponentially hard to solve and significantly increases the running time for alevin. . In general, I'd recommend if you expect very low diversity in the number of barcodes in your experiment, use `--naiveEqclass` otherwise prefer avoiding it. Generally, the experiment with low diversity barcodes results in such a highly dense count matrix that a few error in UMI deduplication won't matter and you can tradeoff extra long running time with reasonable under/over UMI deduplicated counts. . _In short_, 64 guide sequences are relatively high diversity and I'd advise skipping `--naiveEqclass` in your command line argument.

Deployability,"Hi @rhlampe,. Currently, there is no way to prevent the salmon indexer from using more memory if it is needed ot build the index. However, if there is a limit placed by the cluster, it will likely just result in a `bad_alloc` exception from the indexer. The number of sequences alone can tell you a bit about scaling, but the total number of nuclotides being indexed is actually a better predictor of resource usage. How many nucleotides, total, are the references you're considering? While we are working on ways to make the indexing scheme highly scalable, it's worth noting that, to achieve some of it's speed, salmon pre-computes a lot of information it its index (so that the index can become fairly large). One thing I might suggest, if you want to attempt to index and quantify on a very large reference, is to use the `--perfectHash` index in the newest development version of Salmon (pre-release tarball attached below). The latest version (for which the official version should appear soon) represents a number of improvements to index construction. The default indexer has reduced memory usage by ~40%, and the new `--perfectHash` indexer, while somewhat slower, reduces the memory usage even more (by an additional 40-50%). With a fixed memory budget, then, it should allow you to index ever larger references. --Rob.

Deployability,"Hi @rmurray2,. Thank you for the report. First, I just want to mention that I don't believe v0.99.0 to be an officially released version number. That is, there was a v0.14.x and a (released in source only v0.15.0), and then the versions moved to 1.0.0 and beyond. However, this behavior certainly isn't related to that. There are 2 things going on that can lead to this effect. The first one, which is relatively easy to test, is that there may be small changes in when the inferred library type starts to be enforced (if it is not `IU`) when auto type detection is used (see [this issue and comments therein](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/489)). The second and more fundamental thing going on is that the observed behavior is intended. Even with a single thread of execution provided to salmon for mapping and quantification, there is a separate background thread that simply consumes reads from file and puts them in memory for quantification, and while e.g. pairing information between files is guaranteed to be preserved, exact read order is not. This can lead to differences in the order in which reads are processed and, as a result, differences in the initialization conditions of the optimization. The ultimate result is that for transcripts that have large inferential uncertainty, different numbers of reads can be assigned between runs. We have thought *a lot* about this behavior, what it means, and how the `NumRead` values should best be communicated to users. At the end of the day, the `NumReads` constitute the expected value of latent variables inferred in a _very_ high-dimensional space (# of parameters is at least the number of transcripts). Therefore, there are certain transcripts, whose estimated number of reads simply have _tremendous_ inferential uncertainty — and small perturbations in the initial conditions of the optimization will lead to different estimated values for their abundances. For those transcripts where you observe such fluctuations between",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/613#issuecomment-757989858:120,release,released,120,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/613#issuecomment-757989858,4,['release'],['released']

Deployability,"Hi @rob-p, thanks for you response! I think this answers my question, but let me ask a couple follow up questions just to be sure:. In `STAR` there is an option to use stranded alignment (`--readStrand`, which can take ""Unstranded"", ""Forward"", or ""Reverse""). For the pipeline I'm building it would be ideal if I didn't have to specify the strandedness of the library as I'm not the one preparing the samples and it's not always easy to get that information from the scientist in the lab. As such, it would be great if I can use the default strandedness argument to `STAR` (""Unstranded"") and let `salmon` ""do the right thing"" by letting it choose the `libType` for me. With that in mind, if I let `salmon` choose for me (`-l A`) am I risking throwing out any data?. In addition, if a transcript was aligned in a unstranded manner and ended up aligning to the wrong location due to ambiguity between the positive orientation of one transcript and the negative orientation of another, can `salmon` correct this by reassigning it to the right transcript based on the joint probability of all the other alignments (if you can't tell I'm at the edge of my BS zone)?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/590#issuecomment-733278723:267,pipeline,pipeline,267,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/590#issuecomment-733278723,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"Hi @rob-p,. Ah, I hadn't looked carefully at the outputs, so I was overlooking the fact that the `meta_info.json` for `salmon alevin` is in the `aux_info` subdirectory, while the one for `alevin-fry quant` is in the output directory, so I don't _think_ there will be a conflict. (We have been using the same directory in our pipeline for simplicity.) However, I do think having them named the same thing is a potential source of confusion. Is there a reason not to name the file produced by `alevin-fry quant` something more like `quant.json` or `quant_info.json` to be more in parallel with the `collate.json` and `generate_permit_list.json` files generated at those steps? Either way, I agree that merging the files within `alevin-fry` is probably _not_ the best solution. . The `cmd_info.json` file, seems a special case: I am not sure what the ultimate goal for that file is; it seems now to be included ""for R compatibility"" though I am not fully clear on what that means (with `.mtx` input we don't need it, but `tximeta`/`tximport` may be looking for it?). If the final quant output directory does need the file, it would seem to make sense to copy it along somehow from the `salmon alevin --rad` output directory (with a stop along the way in the `collate` output I guess?).

This certainly helped, although I'm still nowhere near a time-frame of ~30min. Here are my results:. The 31-mer running took a bit over an hour and consumed ~17GB of memory. This is about half the running time as the previous version, but approx. the same amount of memory requirement (more on that below). The 17-mer running, took 4.5hrs to complete and consumed ~64GB of memory. This particular running is again, about twice as fast, although the time really depends on the memory limitations I gave it. Since it appears that this version no longer crashes when given less than about 250GB of memory, I also tested with 32G and 16GB of memory, just to see what impact this would have on the times. Those jobs are still running (it's only been about 4hrs as of this writing, I'll update my post if/when they complete). Current logs are showing that they quickly consume all the available memory, but have not yet crashed. I've also got versions with 128-512GB of memory requested (by powers of 2) for comparison. Some random notes: both the 31-mer index experienced about twice as many soft page reclaims with the new/faster version and experienced a few hard page faults (the previous version saw none of the latter). The 17-mer version experienced fewer page reclaims than any of the 31-mer indices and far fewer than with the prior version.

Deployability,"Hi @satta,. Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I am of two minds on this proposal. On one hand, I agree that it is cleaner, in theory, to have a RapMap shared library to which Salmon could simply link. Currently, Salmon pulls in the relevant portions of the RapMap code to call what is essentially an ill-defined public API for mapping. On the other hand, I have two concerns about separating the code at this point, one is major the other minor. The major concern is that both Salmon and RapMap are still very much under active development, core code and even the interfaces are undergoing reasonably rapid changes (thus the versioning < 1.0). This allows me to easily add features that may potentially benefit Salmon to the RapMap codebase, and then to synchronize Salmon releases with particular commits (tags) in the RapMap codebase. The current build system makes it very easy to pull in the appropriately versioned RapMap code. On the other hand, I have very little experience in properly versioning shared libraries so I would have to understand that better and how this could be done without complicating the build process. My _minor_ concern is that I don't know what effect, if any, separating the code into a separate shared library might have on compiler optimizations. Right now, since the relevant RapMap code is compiled alongside Salmon and they are linked together into the same module, certain optimizations may be possible that would not be so when linking to a shared library. My educated guess is that the effect of such optimizations would be negligible, but it's something that may be worth some exploration first. Overall, I'm very open to this idea, but I think I need to do some homework on it before we can commit and undertake the change.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/87#issuecomment-246027704:781,release,releases,781,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/87#issuecomment-246027704,2,['release'],['releases']

Deployability,"Hi @shalercr,. I agree that if each sample runs as quickly as you see here, it's not a big deal to just re-run them all. Note that, while my avoids ~116 times more (eventually-discarded) alignments than did yours, the difference in the number of discarded _fragments_ (i.e. fragments that had no mapping) is very small — ~7,000, or 0.023% of the fragments.

Deployability,"Hi @shanmugavadivelps,. This is because, to properly find and link libiconv, the build requires a version of CMake that ships with FindIConv.cmake. So, to build salmon from source, you should have at least CMake version 3.12. Internally and on our continuous integration servers, we use version 3.15. . Also, I'll mention that it may not be essential to build from source. Salmon is available via Bioconda, and a docker image is available via DockerHub.

Deployability,"Hi @shnmunk,. Yes, the `--noLengthCorrection` flag is recommended for nanopore based quantification. We expect (and generally observe) that there is not a fragmentation effect in ONT data. Therefore, it is recommended that you use the `--noLengthCorrection` flag with ONT data. You are correct that this make the setting of `--fldMean` and `--fldSD` irrelevant, since there is no length effect applied during the EM algorithm. The other point of note is that selective-alignment is not really designed for long reads, so folks typically use salmon with external alignment for quantifying long-read data (minimap2 is a popular choice). Currently, it's necessary to turn off the read error model `--noErrorModel` when processing long-read alignments, as the long read error profiles are very different form those of short reads. However, this is a temporary issue, as a long-read error model has been developed and is in the pipeline. For the time being though, `--noErrorModel --noLengthCorrection` is the relevant set of flags to get the best results with long-read RNA-seq (either cDNA or direct RNA).

Deployability,"Hi @sjackman , Thanks for you question. It is indeed a good observation to use salmon for combining separate CB and read-sequence fastq files.; Having said that, we have designed alevin to work with, and tested it on 10x-chromium `cellranger` pipeline which itself has a feature similar to mentioned above by you (enabled by flag `--dumpfq`). This feature takes in two separate files: one with CB+UMI and another with read-sequence, and performs initial whitelisting (knee based , more intelligent whitelisting happens downstream and needs deduplicated UMI counts or one can just optionally provide external whitelist), error corrects the CB, attaches it to the header (although not with tag `BX:Z`) of the read-sequence in the second file, and dumps it to the standard out. I might have to read a bit about `longranger` and its `FASTQ` format, but if you are familiar with the `longranger` pipeline and are sure that it uses 16+10 (CB+UMI) in one file and read-sequence in the second file, then I think you are good to try alevin with `--dumpfq` flag. Let us know how it goes and if you face any problem. . Note: Just put an extra flag `--noQuant` so that alevin knows to stop after dumping the fastq otherwise it will start performing downstream tasks.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/233#issuecomment-395174284:243,pipeline,pipeline,243,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/233#issuecomment-395174284,2,['pipeline'],['pipeline']
Deployability,"Hi @tamuanand ,. I think these are very important question and thanks for raising the issue.; As you mention, In the preprint we put out two different modes of Selective Alignment:; A) SA: The mashmap and bedtools based pipeline which follows old [SalmonTools](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/blob/master/README.md) based pipeline.; B) SAF: Inbuilt salmon pipeline to consume genome and follows [this](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2019/selective-alignment/) pipeline. The distinction between the two comes from how the decoy sequence are actually generated. To answer your question point wise.; 1.) That's correct SAF based pipeline follows the tutorial as mentioned in B above and uses the full genome as decoys.; 2.) That's correct, if a user wan't to run SA method, then they should follow mashmap based tutorial A. This might be useful for situation where the index is too big to fit into the machine's memory.; 3.) That's also correct, yes if you don't provide decoys `-d` you can still run salmon on the transcriptome. We have just enabled the validateMapping option by default, which is also used in transcriptome only mode, currently there is no option to _disable_ it.; 4) That's also correct, we have dropped the quasi-mapping based support from the latest version, If you need to run quasi we have released `0.15` just as a last version into the archive.; 5 & 6) Very good question, short answer is your default pipeline of VBEM is the recommended way. We have to use additional flags `--mimicBT2 and --useEM` while comparing the methods in the preprint. RSEM can only do EM and as we were comparing against Bowtie2 we have to mimic it with more stricter requirements for fair comparison.

Deployability,"Hi @tamuanand,. Nope; these values are right. The `indexVersion` is a global identifier with respect to previous versions of salmon. It is a global number that is incremented each time (a) a backward-incompatible change to the index is introduced or (b) a fundamentally new piece of information is contained in the index. This field took a value of `1` way back when we started versioning the salmon index a number of years ago, and version `1` was based on the RapMap index (rather than pufferfish like the current one). This is simply a global identifier that we can use internally to determine whether the version of salmon reading this index can be expected to make use of it. The other field `indexType` corresponds to the value from an internal enumeration used in the salmon code. Over the years (since it was first released in 2014), salmon has used a number of different data structures for its underlying index. First, it used a modified version of the FMD index that BWA is based upon, then, it used the RapMap index (based upon a sparse hash map and an uncompressed suffix array), and now it uses the pufferfish index. This `indexType` filed just records the type of this index. In modern (post 1.0.0) versions of salmon, the pufferfish index (`2`) is the only valid version. There's a lot of history to these values, but they all make sense internally within salmon, which is how the contents of this file are primarily used (i.e. to make sure there is compatibility between the version of salmon being run and the index we are trying to consume). Hopefully, this description clears things up a bit.

Deployability,"Hi @tamuanand,. Thank you for the detailed questions! Let me elaborate a bit on a few of @k3yavi's answers. 1&2) Yes; if you want to use SAF, you no longer need mashmap, as what you are essentially doing is treating the entire genome as a ""decoy"". As @k3yavi alludes, SA is still useful when you need to run in a very memory-constrained environment. After adopting the new [pufferfish-based](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish/tree/develop) index, the size of the transcriptome plush mashmap 2 decoys becomes considerably smaller than the previous size of the transcriptome in earlier versions of salmon (<= 0.15.0). However, depending on the organism, indexing the entire genome as decoy, even though it yields the best accuracy, does require a bit more memory, as specified in the release notes for the 0.99 betas and 1.0.0. 3) Yes; it is still possible to use `salmon index` without any decoy sequence. In this case, one can expect results similar to if you had aligned to the target transcriptome using Bowtie2. In this case, you perform indexing by simply not providing any `--decoy` flag to the `index` command. In that case, all of the records in the target fasta will be treated as valid and quantifiable targets. Of course, for reasons detailed in the pre-print --- the high _sensitivity_ of both Bowtie2 and selective-alignment --- we recommend including either mashmap-derived decoys or the organism's genome as a decoy whenever possible. . 4) Related to @k3yavi's response and my elaboration above: we have dropped quasi-mapping from 1.0.0 (though something akin to it may return in the future if there is sufficient demand and if the shortcomings described in the manuscript can be overcome). However, as I mention in part 3 above, this doesn't mean it's not possible to use v1.0.0 without an explicit decoy sequence. The `--decoy` flag of the indexing command is optional, not required. We will update this in the documentation making it more explicit. However, as @k3yavi points ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/442#issuecomment-549195390:790,release,release,790,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/442#issuecomment-549195390,2,['release'],['release']
Deployability,"Hi @tamuanand,. Thanks @k3yavi for pointing out the major idea. Just to fill in some more details. The implementation of SA is, as Avi mentions, part of the mainline salmon code now (in the develop and master branch). We link, in the README, to some pre-constructed decoy-aware transcriptomes, but you can build your own for any organism where you have the transcriptome, the genome, and an annotation, using the script Avi linked to. There are a few ways to enable selective alignment, and the details are listed with the relevant flags in the release notes (we will be updating the documentation shortly with more detailed examples as well). Specifically, you can pass salmon the `—validateMappings` flag, which turns on selective alignment with some reasonable default parameters. You can, instead, pass the flag `—mimicBT2`, which is a meta-flag that enables selective alignment, and turns on a few other things that make the alignments more similar to the Bowtie2 parameters we discuss in the paper (e.g. it disallows orphan alignments). Finally, there is the `—mimicStrictBT2` flag, which mimics Bowtie2 parameters that disallow indels; however, we generally don’t recommend this flag unless you have a particular reason for using it. For any of these, once you’ve built a decoy-aware index, you need not do anything else special during quantification.

Deployability,"Hi @teshomem,. If you want to proceed with transcript-level differential expression, _all transcripts are relevant_. That is, the relevant tools (e.g. DESeq2, limma-voom, Sleuth, etc.) will expect to be provided with _all_ quantified isoforms for each gene. They will then automatically apply their own filtering criteria to determine which transcripts to actually test for DE. . If you want to proceed with DE at the gene level (and hence want to aggregate the quantification information from the level of transcripts to genes), the easiest option is to use the [tximport](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html) package. It can import all of the quantifications from multiple runs of Salmon, aggregate them to the gene level, and produce a count matrix that can then be used with traditional count-based gene-level DE tools.

Deployability,"Hi @tillea and @nileshpatra,. Ok, I dug deeper and found out what's going on. The culprit is, in fact, `libcereal`. The problem is that `libcereal` bumped patch versions only since the version corresponding to the headers included in `pufferfish`, but their changes are not, in fact, backwards compatible! This lead to a version mismatch between the headers used in `pufferfish` and the headers found from the installed package, ultimately resulting in an assertion failure in `rapidjson` (which cereal is using) and a segfault. On the plus side, this was relatively easy to fix by bumping the included cereal headers in pufferfish. I also updated the `Findcereal.cmake` module and added a version constraint so that we now require the new version (1.3.2). This is now tagged and released as `salmon 1.10.1`. Please give that a go when you have a chance. I'll note that, before this is added upstream in debian, I'd still advocate for fixing the `libstaden` package to update to the new version. I'd also recommend moving to dependencies like the ones I've included above to remove some really antiquated dependencies that salmon no longer requires but are still being pulled in.

Deployability,"Hi @tillea,. It seems this is exactly the problem. The build deps here are not quite correct. There are dependencies that salmon no longer has, and some of the dependencies it does have are out of date and can't be used from upstream (e.g. libstaden in the latest version, among others). On the bright side, it's not the dynamic linking alone that is problematic. The following works fine on my end:. ```{bash}; $ docker pull debian:testing; $ docker run -it debian:testing; $ echo ""deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian unstable main"" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/10-debsrc.list; $ apt-get update; $ apt-get upgrade; $ apt-get install build-essential git libboost-all-dev liblzma-dev libbz2-dev cmake zlib1g-dev curl unzip wget libcurl4-openssl-dev libtbb-dev libtbb12 liblzma-dev libjemalloc2 pkg-config libgff-dev; $ wget https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/archive/refs/tags/v1.10.0.tar.gz; $ tar xaf v1.10.0.tar.gz; $ cd salmon-1.10.0; $ mkdir build && cd build; $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_SHARED_LIBS=TRUE -DBZIP2_LIBRARIES=-lbz2 -DBZIP2_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include -DLIBLZMA_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/ -DLIBLZMA_LIBRARY=lzma -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=/usr/share/cmake/Modules -DTBB_WILL_RECONFIGURE=FALSE -DBOOST_WILL_RECONFIGURE=FALSE ..; $ make -j8; $ make install; $ make test; ```.

Deployability,"Hi @tillea,. So I went through the list of deps pulled in by `apt build-dep salmon` and the minimal set I gave above. I tried to make the smallest number of changes I could to the `apt build-dep salmon` list while also removing things that are clearly outdated (we no longer use jellyfish, rapmap, etc. and we use the header-only version of spdlog). As a result I came up with this list of dependencies. The offending dependency seems to be `libcereal-dev`. Specifically, I was able to install just this list of dependencies (minus `libcereal-dev`) atop a clean `debian:testing` and get a working version where the only thing downloaded from the internet was the appropriate version of the pufferfish files grabbed by `fetchPufferfish.sh` in the `1.10.0` release. Once I installed `libcereal-dev` with `apt-get install`, and rebuilt, then I got the segfault mentioned at the top of this issue. So, it seems that we either have to let `salmon` build it's own libcereal, or figure out what the problem is with the library upstream. Please let me know if this you observe this same behavior as well (also @nileshpatra may want to try this out). If so, perhaps we can get `libstaden` updated upstream, and then use this as the new dep list for `salmon`.

Deployability,"Hi @tillea,. Thanks for taking care of pushing this to Debian. The reason for the tags are as follows. Though RapMap is a stand-alone tool, the main mapping algorithm is used (as a library, via an API) within salmon. There are sometimes changes made to the RapMap codebase that are relevant only for salmon. Since we distribute salmon releases via a few channels (including bioconda), we want to have reproducible builds at stable point releases. Thus, every release of salmon is ""paired"" with a corresponding tagged version of RapMap, which is the exact RapMap version used in that version of salmon. Since salmon is updated more frequently than RapMap, and since many times the relevant changes only have an effect for salmon, this approach was taken to not require a major RapMap version bump prior to each new salmon release.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/87#issuecomment-447482180:335,release,releases,335,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/87#issuecomment-447482180,5,"['release', 'update']","['release', 'releases', 'updated']"

Deployability,"Hi @tomsing1,. Thanks for following up on this --- I was scratching my head about why multiple libraries might be causing an issue. Both `--seqBias` and `--gcBias` are relatively new features, and have definitely undergone more testing under the ""quasi-mapping"" codepath than the alignment-based codepath (though it's passed our internal regression tests on both). That being said, bias correction is equally valid regardless of whether you're using quasi-mapping or quantifying from a bam file directly. I'd be happy to take a look if you can provide a small example (a subset of the reads in the bam file?) that triggers the behavior. One thought might be that, for some reason, positions in the bam file could disagree with what's provided in the corresponding fasta.

Deployability,"Hi @uros-sipetic!. Unfortunately, as you suggest, there really is no good way to infer the fragment length distribution from only single-end reads. Rather, this flag determines how the conditional probability of single-end fragments near the beginning (if in the rc orientation) or end (if in the forward orientation) of the transcript are determined. A single-end read does not have any known fragment length. But we do know that e.g. fragments very close to the end or beginning of the transcript are rather unlikely. In this case, we can integrate (sum) over all possibilities to assign a conditional probability. This is what salmon does. For a single-end read (assume forward orientation for simplicity) at position i on a transcript of length n, we consider the conditional fragment length probability to be given by F_n(n-i), where f_n is the conditional fragment length distribution conditioned on the transcript length (maximum observable length) being n and F_n is the cumulative distribution function of f_n. Intuitively, this means that fragments very close to transcript ends will get a smaller conditional probability, while those farther from the end will get larger conditional probabilities. The `--noSingleFragProb` flag simply turns off this conditional probability all together. It is _not_ recommended to disable the single-end fragment length probability modeling. We have evidence from testing that it improves quantification accuracy. Thus, I would suggest _not_ setting the `--noSingleFragProb` flag.

Deployability,"Hi @vals,. So there was a very subtle bug in `useFSPD` that would (in a very non-reproducible manner) trigger such a segfault. It was related to some very tricky locking behavior. However, the manner in which `useFSPD` corrected for position specific bias isn't actually compatible with our new sequence-specific and fragment-gc bias models. Thus, I've deprecated `useFSPD`. The replacement is the flag `posBias`. This models the same type of positional bias, but does so in a way that is compatible with our other bias models. It also doesn't rely on the tricky threading behavior, so it should be more stable. Unlike sequence-specific and fragment-gc bias, however, the `posBias` option is still _experimental_ in the 0.7.0 release. However, we have been testing it internally, and I'd be very grateful for your feedback if you have a chance to try it out.

If 0x4 is set, no assumptions can be made about RNAME, POS, CIGAR, MAPQ, and bits 0x2, 0x100, and 0x800. That is, if the unmapped flag is set, then there is not a specific ""correct"" setting for these other fields, since they should most likely be ignored anyway.

Deployability,"Hi @vertesy ,. Thanks for asking the very interesting question.; I'd say the answer might depend on what's your downstream use case. Traditionally, no quantification pipeline, in my knowledge, has used the pre-mRNA counts alone to bump up the gene counts, however, recent method of estimating RNA-velocity does utilizes the intronic counts for extracting the ratio of spliced/unspliced counts. If you are interested in disjoint signals (gene count matrix) for spliced and unspliced molecules you can use the recent scheme of decoy indexing from our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v2). We (mostly @csoneson) have been testing alevin with following scheme for generating spliced and unspliced counts. 1.) Spliced Counts: Index transcriptome w/ pre-mRNA sequence as the decoys.; 2) Unspliced Counts: Index pre-mRNA sequence w/ transcriptome as the decoys. The third case is a little tricky because if you index both pre-mRNA and transcriptome, due to relatively longer length of pre-mRNA sequence compared to transcripts it might end-up biasing the UMI deduplication algorithm towards unspliced counts. To summarize, the best way to have an additive spliced and unspliced counts is still an open area of research.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/450#issuecomment-555136444:166,pipeline,pipeline,166,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/450#issuecomment-555136444,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"Hi @yagam-fluent,. Thanks for the excellent question. We should update the documentation regarding this option. Basically, in `salmon alevin`, we assumptions about expected read orientation are applied as ""hard filters"". That is, the behavior is equivalent to `--incompatPrior 0`, so that aligninments not in the prescribed orientation are simply not considered as invalid alignments. This is because in the case of single-cell processing, we (the community in general) currently do not have as sophisticated of probabilistic models for resolving UMI origins and gene abundances, and so algorithms typically do not take into account a ""wrong orientation"" probability. So, in `salmon alevin` if you are using alevin itself for the quantification, then hard filtering will be applied based on the expectations of `--libType`. On the other hand, if you are using `salmon alevin` to simply map the reads for subsequent processing with [`alevin-fry`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry) (i.e. `salmon alevin .... --rad` or `salmon alevin ... --sketch`), then *no* filtering is applied to mapping orientation, and instead you filter reads by orientation later in `alevin-fry`'s `generate-permit-list` step.

Deployability,"Hi Andrea,. The bias correction time depends on the number of expressed transcripts. There is a flag to speed it up `--biasSpeedSamp`. It takes a value by which to downsample the fragment length pmf for bias modeling. The larger this number, the faster bias correction will become. The default is 1, and is super conservative (we are probably going to make the default 5 in the next release because it is much faster with no real difference in modeling quality). In fact, values up to at least 10 seem to work quite well with respect to the baseline.

Deployability,"Hi Andreas,. So I don't know if there is a easy way to get the specific list of reverse dependencies, but then we can cross-check it with my explicit list above:. ```; build-essential; git ; libboost-all-dev ; liblzma-dev ; libbz2-dev ; cmake ; zlib1g-dev ; curl ; unzip ; wget ; libcurl4-openssl-dev ; libtbb-dev ; libtbb12 ; liblzma-dev ; libjemalloc2 ; pkg-config ; libgff-dev; ```. One thing I noticed during build is that, while I included `libjemalloc2` here, the salmon build procedure still downloaded and built `jemalloc`. However, I don't _think_ jemalloc is the thing causing the segfault. Regarding dependencies that can't be used — the current `libstaden` is behind the upstream release. The upstream release contains an important bug fix for a bug (and suggested fix that we proposed to the developer) upon which we rely. More importantly, afaik there is no relevant `libpufferfish-dev` package (we certainly have not made one), and so there is not even e.g. a check in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Salmon's build always tries to run `fetchPufferfish.sh` to download the relevant `pufferfish` source files needed to build `salmon`. Critically, the relevant `pufferfish` dependencies and `salmon` releases move in lockstep. Each new `salmon` release it accompanied by a new tag in the `pufferfish` repo (so that the specific source used to build a given `salmon` release is fixed and easily trackable). So, I think the easiest way to move forward is to:. * do a diff of my list of packages above with what is pulled in by `apt build-dep salmon`. * figure out why, even when `libjemalloc2` is installed, the build system tries to build `jemalloc` itself (maybe we need the dev package?). * determine what folks want to do upstream about the lockstep pufferfish dependency.

Deployability,"Hi Avi, thanks for your detailed explanation!.

Based on above, the newly included cells w/ increased number of `--expectCells` are also more likely to be filtered out in later steps using criteria such as `min of number of features/reads` detected per sample.

Deployability,"Hi Hari,. Some thoughts on your questions:. > I had to use mem_free=34G for building index. Is that expected?. Certainly, it is _not_ the case that index creation should require 34G of physical memory. When indexing the genome and transcriptome in dense mode, we typically expect it to require <20G of physical RAM (and <4 for just the transcriptome). However, we have noticed some strange behavior in the past about how compute clusters manage process allocation — sometimes, it seems, one must overcommit. Given the diversity of different software on which different compute clusters run, as well as the manifold way sysadmins may configure these things, we've not found a universal explanation / conclusion yet, but it does seem that the resources actually required (e.g. if you run salmon index under `/usr/bin/time` and look at the resources) are less than what should be requested. The differences in the sha256 sums are a bit strange and I don't have a great explanation for them. One difference is that I built with the head of the develop branch (which has version tag 1.3.1). That describes a difference in `versionInfo.json` but nothing upstream in the index building should have changed, so I am not sure why the other files would have different sha256 sums. I can try with the pre-compiled binary and see if my results match yours. In the meantime, please keep me posted. If index building ends up worth for you with a different configuration, it would be good to check this off of our list of TODOs, and if not, it would be good to get to the bottom of it.

Deployability,"Hi Kadir,. How significant are the differences? There is a stochastic component to the algorithm, so one would not generally expect identical results between runs. However, differences should be small. The use of the `-g` flag should not affect transcript level inference, since the aggregation to gene-level abundances is done post-facto (i.e. after all transcript-level abundances have been estimated). Nonetheless, [tximport](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html) is the recommended way to aggregate transcript-level inferences to the gene level.

Deployability,"Hi Kristoffer,. The duplicate transcript issue is a frustrating one. It came to our attention when we noticed that ensembl often annotated transcripts on patch / haplotype contigs that were identical and unlikely to be different from more ""canonical"" transcripts in any way. Further, these transcripts are indistinguishable from the quantification perspective. That being said, the removal of sequence duplicate transcripts is optional in Salmon. If you pass `--keepDuplicates` to the indexer, it wont remove them. Also, Salmon does record, in the index directory, the ""collapsing map"". Specifically, there is a tsv file that record, for every collapsed transcript, the transcript that was sequence identical and retained in the index. You can use this map to recover the abundances for the collapsed transcripts, since they are all sequence identical, they should all have an abundance of x / num duplicates (where x is the abundance of the retained transcript). I hope this info helps. Let me know if there is anything else i can clarify or help with.

The error you're getting looks like what happens when the version of boost against which salmon is attempting to link was not built with >= C++11. Basically, the newest version of salmon requires C++14 (which GCC 8 obviously supports). However, there are binary incompatibilities between pre-C++11 and post-C++11 code libraries. So, whatever version of boost you link against must have been compiled with at least `--std=c++11`.

Deployability,"Hi Nick,. No problem at all; sorry for not providing a better explanation (I'm planning on writing one up for when this feature is listed in the next official release). In terms of strategy, my recommendation would be to use the default (the `dense hash`) unless indexing memory becomes a problem. The main differences are the following:; - The perfect hash uses an external memory algorithm to construct the hash function, and so requires less memory.; - Because the perfect hash function is built in external memory, **construction** of the hash using this data structure is sower. I don't have longitudinal benchmarks, but it is somewhere between 2 and 5x slower to populate the perfect hash than the dense hash.; - Once constructed, the perfect hash is _considerably_ smaller, and so quantification on an index built using a perfect hash will require only ~50% of the memory that is required when using a dense hash. Obviously if you're quantifying on the same machine that was able to build the index, this isn't a problem. However, if you're shipping the index to smaller memory computers, then this is something to consider.; - The performance difference in terms of mapping speed is very minimal; the minimum perfect hash can be 5-10% slower than the dense hash, but this difference is usually only a matter of seconds. Also, the total runtime difference can be even less since the smaller perfect hash can be read more quickly from disk than the larger dense hash. So, the standard recommendation would be use the default unless you run into memory problems building the index; in that case, try enabling the `--perfectHash` flag.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/53#issuecomment-204069238:159,release,release,159,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/53#issuecomment-204069238,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"Hi Ryan,. The difficulty is, indeed, exactly as you specify. Given a single-end read, one does not know the length of the _fragment_ from which it originates. In this case the ""right"" thing to do (the best thing we can do) is to consider the read as starting / ending a fragment of every possible length allowed by the user-provided fragment length distribution (with the contribution of each possible fragment weighted by the probability of observing a fragment of that length). In order to make this computationally feasible, one would have to do some clever pre-computation and thing a bit more about how to efficiently update the observed GC model (right now, each mapping contributes a single weight to the model, but under the naive implementation in the single-end case, each mapping would contribute different weights to each bin of the observed GC-bias curve, which would slow things down considerably). Also, as you point out, the quality of the correction would depend somewhat on the user providing appropriate parameters for the fragment length distribution mean and standard deviation — but this seems reasonable in the single-end case. That being said, I'm sure there's a way to handle this efficiently, I'd just have to think about it a bit. Regarding your second question; Salmon learns the fragment length distribution in paired-end data, but not with single-end data. Single-end data can provide a little bit of information (e.g. there is in upper bound on fragment lengths that one can infer based on single-end reads based on how far they map from the end of the transcript), but not enough information to reliably infer a fragment length distribution. cc @mikelove in case he has any thoughts on this.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/83#issuecomment-243833424:623,update,update,623,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/83#issuecomment-243833424,2,['update'],['update']
Deployability,"Hi Ryan,. You're right. This fact is not documented and it should be. I'll update the docs to address this. Using the `A` library type with pre-computed alignments has one additional complication that doesn't arise in the quasi-mapping mode. That is, many aligners offer the user the capability of aligning the reads with a prescribed library type (e.g. TopHat, HISAT, etc.), so that in this case the implied library type depends not only on how the reads map to the underlying transcriptome, but also on the parameters with which the reads were aligned with the upstream alignment tool. .

Deployability,"Hi Stephen,. So, the variation you see when you re-run salmon multiple times is _expected_ to be different (and _much_ smaller) than the variance you see when bootstrapping. Why is this? When you re-run salmon, the only variance you are seeing is due to small differences in the order of observations / updates from the streaming collapsed variational Bayes phase of the algorithm. This, in turn can have a _slight_ effect on the initialization conditions of the offline phase of the algorithm, and some of the parameters learned for the auxiliary parameters. However, in each run, you are observing _exactly_ the same set of reads and salmon is producing _exactly_ the same set of alignments; only the order and therefore some of the streaming updates change. So, we expect the final estimated abundances to be _very_ similar to each other. However, when salmon performs bootstrapping, it is actually resampling _with replacement_, from the counts of the range-factorized equivalence classes. Roughly, we expect this resampling to be similar to if we re-sampled _with replacement_ from the original set of input reads. That is, we are re-sampling from our population sample — the observed set of reads — to estimate the variance due to inference. So, for the bootstrap re-samplings, we expect significantly more variance than between subsequent runs of salmon, because the observations from which we are making the inference are actually changing. It is possible e.g. that some uniquely mapped reads may not be chosen in some bootstrap sample (since we are re-sampling the observed read count, but doing so _with replacement_), and so the estimates of sets of related isoforms will change in those samples. Thus, since the observations themselves are changing, we expect the estimates to display greater variance. In fact, this is the main goal of performing the bootstrapping (or Gibbs sampling) — to estimate the uncertainty due to inference if we had observed many reads coming from the same under",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/466#issuecomment-568828362:303,update,updates,303,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/466#issuecomment-568828362,4,['update'],['updates']
Deployability,"Hi Valentine,. Thanks for reporting this! Do you have any recollection of what option might be incompatible with Gibbs? Specifically, it's interesting that it doesn't work with Gibbs (it looks like you're getting `std::numeric_limits<double>::min()` everywhere) but works with Bootstrapping. I will certainly look into this and will document (and make an explicit warning) any known incompatibilities in the next release. I'd very much like to fix the issue with Gibbs sampling, as it's substantially faster than bootstrapping for a large number of samples. Actually, there's a fairly substantial upgrade to the bias modeling that is just about ready and will be part of the next release (which is, in fact, what has delayed v0.7.0 for so long). Regarding converting counts back to TPM, what you're doing there looks like it's actually converting to NPM (nucleotides per million) which is a relative abundance measure that is not normalized for transcript length. To get TPM estimates from the bootstrap numbers what you would want to do would be something like: `TPM = 1e6 * ((bootstraps / effective_lengths) / (bootstraps / effective_lengths).sum())`. --Rob",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/58#issuecomment-218589200:413,release,release,413,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/58#issuecomment-218589200,3,"['release', 'upgrade']","['release', 'upgrade']"

If you download the source from [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/archive/hash-resize-hotfix.zip), or checkout the branch `hash-resize-hotfix`, you can pass alevin an extra hidden option `--maxHashResizeThreads` that allows you to limit the maximum number of threads used during the hash table resize.

If so, please let us know so we can merge the fix back into develop (and then master).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/234#issuecomment-395907924:26,hotfix,hotfix,26,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/234#issuecomment-395907924,3,['hotfix'],['hotfix']
Deployability,"Hi again,. Together with Mark Miller (JHPCE's admin) we ran more tests. We verified that `Salmon` does indeed use at least 2 threads so now I'm always requesting 2 from SGE. We also noticed that when the jobs fail due to memory (the actual issue in this thread) they fail after the `There is 1 library` message as shown below for one test:. ```; [2017-04-05 14:28:09.021] [jointLog] [info] parsing read library format; [2017-04-05 14:28:09.035] [jointLog] [info] There is 1 library.; terminate called without an active exception; /cm/local/apps/sge/var/spool/compute-064/job_scripts/420662: line 31: 28651 Aborted (core dumped) /dcl01/lieber/ajaffe/Emily/RNAseq-pipelin; e/Software/Salmon-0.8.2_linux_x86_64/bin/salmon quant -i /dcl01/lieber/ajaffe/Emily/RNAseq-pipeline/Annotation/Salmon_index_test/salmon_0.8.2_index_gencode; .v25.transcripts -p 1 -l ISR -1 ${FILE1} -2 ${FILE2} -o /dcl01/lieber/ajaffe/lab/libd_alzheimers/hg38/salmon_test7/${ID}; ```.

Deployability,"Hi guys,. Which existing dependencies would you like to be able to use? There are some of these libraries that cannot be replaced by already installed variants. Specifically,; - BWA --- since the version that is pulled in and used actually requires we expose certain functionality for our lightweight alignment procedure (though this dependency may go away all together if we deprecate lightweight alignment in favor of quasi-mapping).; - Jellyfish --- here, we require the ability to use jellyfish as a library. Specifically, we rely on some headers that are not installed with the standard package. Perhaps here there could be some synergy with Guillaume on making all of the things Salmon uses part of the standard Jellyfish install, but, at least currently, this isn't the case. The CMake build system already looks for existing versions of the following before fetching them:; - Boost; - tbb; - jemalloc. So, the the remaining guys are `libgff` (which is just some small libraryification of a gff parser that I put together a while ago, I don't know that it's in any package manager --- is it? It doesn't even have an associated install script) and `staden IO lib`. For Staden, I'd be happy to have it look for an existing installation, but there is no FindStaden.cmake that I know of, and I don't really know how to write FindX.cmake files appropriately.

It checks if you have tbb version 2018 or above. If you install tbb BEFORE running cmake, it will fulfill the requirement and bypass installing tbb in the make command, hence bypass the error. The solution:; 1. Delete the salmon folder and download a fresh one from github; 2. sudo apt update (this step is very important, to update the packages to be above version 2018) ; 3. sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev; 4.

Usually we try to follow upstream closely (which we failed for salmon blatantly for several reasons - one is the close connection to pufferfish).; Regarding `pufferfish`: We tried hard to get `pufferfish` packaged but failed (due to the use of other versions of `spdlog`, `cereal`, and `fmt`) However, since we can't run `fetchPufferfish.sh` *inside the build process* I was running it separately and added the downloaded source in [debian/external/pufferfish](https://salsa.debian.org/med-team/salmon/-/tree/master/debian/external/pufferfish) So I think the requirement of salmon should be fulfilled.

Deployability,"I think your first suggestion would be the best option - although not sure you want worm transcripts in your decoy file. An alternative is to just quantify the entire collection of sequences. This is what [our pipeline](https://github.com/Novartis/pisces) does.

You can specify your GTF/FASTA pairs using a [config file](https://github.com/Novartis/pisces/blob/9936079ac75d4b75be95bad5bc962465e8c5f458/pisces/config.json#L46-L49) and the pipeline builds index files, helps run salmon and some basic QC, and outputs separate expression matrices for each individual organism - normalized back to TPM space.

Deployability,"I would argue that Kallisto is ""cheating"" a bit by looking at expression of the equivalence classes :p, avoiding the ambiguous assignment issue. Just offering an opinion as a Salmon fan, but to me it seems extremely hard to make the data generation model of coverage based sequencing compatible with umi-tags. I've been thinking a bit about this, and actually, if the PCR bias model in 0.7/Alpine is good, it might even make sense to _ignore_ the UMI and quantify the expression based the mRNA tags alone. In this case you would just need to change transcript length to be constant per transcript, and only update effectiveLength's based on the sequence biases. The reason you have UMI's in the first place, is that 3'/5'-tag libraries will have much lower complexity than full-length libraries, and due to that you can argue that PCR bias will be a larger problem. But if it is possible to accurately account for the PCR bias with GC content, maybe they are not so needed?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/93#issuecomment-249524891:607,update,update,607,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/93#issuecomment-249524891,1,['update'],['update']

Regarding outputting ""original read counts""; salmon *does* output the estimates for the number of reads deriving from each transcript.

Tools that simply count reads (e.g. HTSeq) produce integer counts, but these are in no way ""original read counts"" for the corresponding genes, and are usually less accurate (farther from the true number of fragments deriving from a transcript / gene) than the estimates produced by salmon.
