Availability," (to allow us to keep track of empty spaces), but a `Qobj` whose dimensions would be a `Compound` made entirely of `Field` will instead become a Python complex number. The dimensions types should be available for advanced users (to allow them to access the full parsing speed-ups), but should not be presented as the standard choice. I propose we place the types inside a nested namespace, such as `qutip.dims` (logically - physically it would be `qutip/core/dims.py`), to allow the form `from qutip.dims import *` where appropriate without forcing the user to do the modern bad practice left over from our MATLAB past `from qutip import *`. ## User impact. In principle, nothing will change for the normal QuTiP user compared to the 4.x branch. You will still be able to supply the `dims` argument to the `Qobj` constructor as lists in the exact same format, and they will be parsed in the same way. Users _do not_ need to type out the new computer-friendly dimensions objects, but they will be available for advanced users who frequently make `Qobj` using the raw constructor with funny dimensions. We will publicly provide `qutip.dims.parse` to turn a list into the new form, so even advanced users do not need to type out all the nonsense. `Qobj` factory functions that take a `dims` parameter should now also accept the new form. Since almost all of them just pass this directly to the `dims` argument in the `Qobj` constructor, this likely won't involve any developer effort. `Qobj` construction overhead should be reduced to near-zero when passed a new dimensions object, which we will always do within the library. Compared to the 4.x branch, the overhead of `Qobj` will shrink from ~100µs to ~1µs in library code, even for functions where the `Qobj` type cannot be cleanly inferred from the input types. ## Particular points worth commenting on. 1. Are there currently valid `Qobj` that cannot be represented with this system?; 2. Should we push to implement basis-safety for QuTiP 5.x?; 3.

Availability," 2 spaces:. ket: Dimensions(Field, Space); bra: Dimensions(Space, Field); oper: Dimensions(Space, Space); ... This Dimension is the `Map` proposed by Jake, but ket are map from `Field` to `Space` and not `Space` themselves. Spaces come into multiple sub classes as proposed : `Space`, `SuperSpace`, `Field`, `Compound`, and `EnrSpace`. Splitting maps and spaces simplify spaces by not needing to have a dummy 2nd dims. Dimensions can be initiated from a list and converted back to one. Field are automatically contracted: `Compound(Field, Field)` is a `Field`, same for maps. With the exceptions that `Qobj` with a shape of `(1,1)` with be a `Dimensions(Field, Field)` and not a `Field`. . Some previously valid and used list format are no longer accepted. Playing with of tensor of super operators, `permute` and `reshuffle`, you could make object with dims as `[[[2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]], [[2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]]]` which can be interpreted as the tensor of 3 super operators. But then `[[[2, 2], [3, 3]], [[2, 2],[3, 3]]]` can both be interpreted as tensor of super operator or super operator of tensor spaces, so : ; - `[[[2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]], [[2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4]]]`: Error; - `[[[2, 2], [4, 4]], [[2, 2], [4, 4]]]`: list representation of dimensions of `to_super(tensor(oper, oper))`; - `[[[2], [2], [3], [3]], [[2], [2], [3], [3]]]`: list representation of dimensions of `tensor(to_super(oper), to_super(oper))`. Dimensions object have a `type` and `shape` set a initialization. There is a check when creating/ modifying a `Qobj` with between the data's shape and dims's shape and an error is raise when they are not matching. . Since operator-ket have a `superrep`, I added the `superrep` parameter to the Superspace instead of the dimensions, for now. But a better look at super operator representation is needed. `Qobj.dims` take and return a list, keeping the dimension object internally.

Availability," 50-branch `if/elif` (in the bad cases) based on the name. `QubitCircuit` shouldn't need the million `_gate_resolved` functions - if there's a `Gate` class, instances of that (whether done by subclass or composition) should be supplying it (though the lookup table is a good choice under the circumstances). Given how `circuit.py` currently organises its data, it feels like you have to introduce some seemingly arbitrary splits to keep CodeClimate happy, but I'd argue the problem is the data structure, and CodeClimate is right to complain about the complexity. In stuff like compilers, there's a reason code compilers do parsing->verification->optimisation, with several passes in the last one, and transform things internally into a very strict intermediate representation at every step. `Qobj._repr_latex_` was like this - the `master` version is claimed to be like ""78"" complexity, but I'd be prepared to bet CodeClimate would have the `dev.major` version less than 10 and I think the output is near byte-for-byte identical. The change is that the `master` version basically reimplements the same algorithm 4 times with complex, split up for loops (not to mention that for some reason the alignment and new-line characters are considered part of formatting a number?). The `dev.major` version first decides if it's going to truncate the rows and/or columns, then it just calls a formatter on each row it decided it wants rendering with a special value to say when it should output a truncation character, and then joins the rows together. Obviously it's not _always_ the data structure - e.g. in `propagator` the branching to choose an evaluation method is fine, but once it's chosen, it should delegate to specialised methods. That way, the maintainer can verify the branching paths with a nice top-down overview without 50 lines of specialised logic inbetween each one, then you can verify each specialised path independently. If you did that, I'm sure the ""complexity"" would drop to like 10.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1447#issuecomment-782249555:3256,down,down,3256,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1447#issuecomment-782249555,1,['down'],['down']

Availability," I suggest we consider dropping most of them, and consequently their surrounding `Cython` code to ease maintainability and reduce code bloat of the repository. First, a couple of arguments against doing so:; - the versions in `scipy` and `qutip` did subsequently diverge in some form, because they no longer universally give the same results, possibly as a result of #654.; - the `qutip` version of `reverse_cuthill_mckee` is about 10% faster than the `scipy` version; - people may be using them. I think the main argument in favour of removal is that they're now also in `scipy` as `scipy.sparse.csgraph`. For the speed argument, for 1000 by 1000 matrices we're talking 780us vs 850us per matrix difference, so it's unlikely to be a limiting factor, and I think the ability to remove a large chunk of Cython code and maintainability cost outweighs this. I began investigating this because I was looking at `qutip.graph.reverse_cuthill_mckee`, since some of its tests are incorrect. The error is here:; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/01132789581821517986fad1a14ab3feec7d2de2/qutip/tests/test_graph.py#L91-L108; Line 105 is broken: it should read; ```python; assert np.all(ans_perm == perm); ```; to test if _all_ the elements match. As it stands, it currently tests that _not all are different_, or in other words, it would only fail if not a single element in the two arrays matched. On fixing this line, we then learn that the test is actually a failing test, because the expected and actual results do not match (though they do however have equal bandwidths). I also note that `qutip` and `matlab` are in disagreement for the test case there: for the matrix; ```python; np.array([[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],; [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],; [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],; [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],; [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],; [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],; [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],; [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],; [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],; [0, 1, 0, 0, 0,",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1203:1223,error,error,1223,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1203,1,['error'],['error']
Availability," This is the case if one has data describing the time-dependent object which is not easy to write analytically. In `brmesolve` the only option is to provide time-dependent functions as strings (or Cubic_Spline). This works fine for the Hamiltonian, but the `a_ops` fail a check in cy/brcodegen.py when using a Cubic_Spline type. **To Reproduce**; ```python; import qutip as qt; import numpy as np. x = np.arange(0, 10, 0.1); decay = np.exp(-x); decay_spline = qt.Cubic_Spline(x[0], x[-1], decay). sol1 = qt.brmesolve([[qt.qeye(2), ""exp(-t)""]], qt.qeye(2), [0, 1], a_ops=[[qt.qeye(2), ""exp(-w)""]]) # works fine; sol2 = qt.brmesolve([[qt.qeye(2), decay_spline]], qt.qeye(2), [0, 1], a_ops=[[qt.qeye(2), ""exp(-w)""]]) # works fine; sol3 = qt.brmesolve([[qt.qeye(2), ""exp(-t)""]], qt.qeye(2), [0, 1], a_ops=[[qt.qeye(2), decay_spline]]) # error; sol4 = qt.brmesolve([[qt.qeye(2), decay_spline]], qt.qeye(2), [0, 1], a_ops=[[qt.qeye(2), decay_spline]]) # error; ```. On the cases it gives an error (sol3, sol4), it is `Exception: Invalid a_td_term.` from br_codegen.py (`aop_td_funcs()`).; Note that the Cubic_Spline representation works perfectly fine for the Hamiltonian part (e.g. sol2). It also appears to work fine if specifying `c_ops`. **Expected behavior**; My understanding from the documentation regarding time-dependent objects is that the Cubic_Spline representation should work for brmesolve at all argument positions, where appropriate (not just the Hamiltonian and c_ops). For example, at the above URL, we have: <br/>; ""When combining interpolating functions with other Python functions or strings, the interpolating class will automatically pick the appropriate method for calling the class. That is to say that, if for example, you have other time-dependent terms that are given in the string-format, then the cubic spline representation will also be passed in a string-compatible format. In the string-format, the interpolation function is compiled into c-code, and thus is quite fast.

Availability," `/qutip/tests` (I originally didn't like it, but I now see more and more benefits of the `/src` (or `/lib`) convention in Python projects).; - the current `qutip/tests` should entirely become `/test/qutip`; - a new `/src/qutip/test` becomes a fully-supported _public_ module, including base classes (such as the data-layer mixins) and things like that. We'd need to be careful, because reducing your possibilities for flexibility in testing generally sounds like a bad idea to me, but if we take care to be very limited, it could work. I suspect you won't be able to import the test suite from inside `qutip.core.data` because of cyclical dependencies, which is probably a good thing - it'll force us to put the structure the right way round immediately. For an idea pretty far out of left field:; - the data layer tests should really _discover_ the specialisations rather than us needing to specify them (this is true regardless of this PR); - if so, in the new form, we _could_ directly export this part of the test suite from `qutip.test` (our test suite would import this as well), and add a little bit of logic to allow filtering of which tests need to be run (class decorators, probably); - downstream packages could then test just by importing our classes and disabling any specialisations that are only on internal data-layer objects. I'm not 100% sure how I feel about this, but it's plausible - we'd still be able to add extra methods in our own test suite if we wanted them, because we could just derive from the classes, rather than defining the names into the test suite in those cases. ---. About us breaking downstream CI: having been a maintainer of QuTiP and now Qiskit, I have a deep-rooted hatred for any upstream package that forces CI failures on its dependents, because it _requires_ the lower packages to move ""fix CI"" way up to the top of their priority list; you can't merge _anything_ until CI is running again, which is very frustrating.

The rest of this text is very similar to the original message in #1429. ---. This patch overhauls how QuTiP is packaged and distributed. Once this patch is merged, there will be an option on QuTiP's GitHub Actions tab for people who have write permission on qutip/qutip to build all wheels and optionally release the build to PyPI, making it available on `pip` as a binary release. The major changes are in the files `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg` and `.github/workflows/build.yml`, while `MANIFEST.in` and a new file `VERSION` were also touched. ### Distribution changes:; - there is a GitHub Action which will build all the wheels for CPython 3.6+ on Linux (`manylinux1` x86 and x86_64), macOS and Windows (32- and 64-bit). This action is triggered manually, and the wheels will be available for download afterwards. Optionally, the action will push to PyPI, making the version immediately available on `pip` by binary release.; - `.cpp` files are now distributed with the wheels but not added to source control. This is a step towards a full Cython-free delivery of the QuTiP source (binary releases never require Cython), but right now I think our `setuptools` machinery doesn't quite handle that. ### Changes to `setup.py`; - all package metadata is moved out into `setup.cfg`, which is easier to read and change, and modern `setuptools`' preferred way of doing things; - all directory-tree access is done in a completely platform-agnostic manner, rather than just hoping that Unix-style paths will work on Windows; - the file is tidied and structured into a small script, with separated components; - build requirements are moved into `pyproject.toml` including listing `setuptools` as the build method, in accordance with PEP 517.

Availability," a while. Again, this certainly isn't an unsolvable problem: having versioning in the interface API is one solution to some of these problems. ---. For greater discussion, here's an alternate approach: instead of objects defining `__qutip_qobj__`, instead we expose an entry-point `qutip.Qobj.register_conversion_function(converter, type, priority, version=None)`, and downstream libraries register functions rather than defining methods on their classes. The logic inside the `Qobj` constructor remains approximately the same as what you suggest. I think TensorFlow does something a little more similar to this? (I'm not very familiar with it at all.). Advantages of this over a `__qutip_qobj__` magic method:; - Users aren't limited to what libraries define for them, but can add their own conversions or override library ones if they don't like them. I actually see this as being closer to Julia's dispatch, or Rust's `impl for`.; - It doesn't involve weird namespacing, or anything like that, and doesn't require downstream classes to carry around additional slots. It's less an issue for classes that define `__slots__` since those are frozen methods, but extra methods adds a minor amount vtable weight for most libraries, and makes their class definitions more complex.; - Control between different versions is perhaps a little easier (though a minor point): this _feels_ easier to separate out different versions, and detect what to register as the conversion function with QuTiP. This is a particular advantage for Python classes compiled as C-extensions (like from C or Cython), which typically don't allow assigning methods dynamically.; - A library could even register multiple versions of the conversion function with us, and let QuTiP handle API versioning centrally, rather than requiring downstream libraries to roll their own checks.; - We're basically already set up to do this in `dev.major` already.

Availability," current test of superoperator representations uses `choi_to_kraus` which also calls `scipy.linalg.eig`. Here is a file `kraus.py` that can reproduce these segfaults semi-reliably (may need to run it a few times to get it to trigger):. ```python; import qutip. s = qutip.rand_super(); c = qutip.to_choi(s); k = qutip.to_kraus(c); ```. For example, here's a similar command on this file:. ```; Debug memory block at address p=0x7f98cc467db0: API 'r'; 61503 bytes originally requested; The 7 pad bytes at p-7 are FORBIDDENBYTE, as expected.; The 8 pad bytes at tail=0x7f98cc476def are not all FORBIDDENBYTE (0xfd):; at tail+0: 0x00 *** OUCH; at tail+1: 0x00 *** OUCH; at tail+2: 0x00 *** OUCH; at tail+3: 0x00 *** OUCH; at tail+4: 0x00 *** OUCH; at tail+5: 0x00 *** OUCH; at tail+6: 0x00 *** OUCH; at tail+7: 0x00 *** OUCH; Data at p: dd dd dd dd dd dd dd dd ... 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00. Enable tracemalloc to get the memory block allocation traceback. Fatal Python error: bad trailing pad byte; Python runtime state: finalizing (tstate=0x7f98c9d018e0). Current thread 0x0000000109fe85c0 (most recent call first):; <no Python frame>; Abort trap: 6; ```. So these both use `scipy.linalg.eig`, which is suspicious. ## Valgrind checks. To see if I could track it down, I had a go with valgrind. This isn't guaranteed to find everything, because I'm not using a debug build of Python, and Python also typically optimises small allocations by using a custom allocator into some pre-allocated space it manages itself - invalid writes that still fall within this may not get detected by valgrind. Here is the output of `valgrind` running on the `kraus.py` file I wrote in the previous section: [kraus_valgrind.txt](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/files/6370180/kraus_valgrind.txt) (note I filtered out like 30,000 errors that stem from Python's internal memory management - they're nothing to worry about, they're just what happens when you have your own allocator).

Availability," has it's option class (SeOptions, MeOptions, etc.) with only needed keys.This somewhat feel overkill since they are all the some for now, until mcsolve is merged. Each integrator also has an associated options and the solver options contain an integrator options. Conversion between options type will raise an error. When creating a solver options, it read the `method` key and setup a matching integrator options. Thus only the keys used by the solver or integrator are defined in the instance. This allow adding new integrator with their own options without adding complexity to the solver options. It can be used as such:; ```; opt = SolverOptions(method='lsoda'); opt['progress_bar'] = False; opt.ode['max_order_ns'] = 10; ```; To make it work smoothly, each integrator must be associated to only one method thus `zvode` was split between `adams` and `bdf`. There is also a generic `Options` class that accept any keys used by integrator or solver and can be converted to any specific solver options:; ```; Options(futur_cupy_ode_specific_options=True) # Will work; Options(not_an_options=True) # Error; # For most solver:; __solve(..., opt=Options()); ```; Once options are associated to a solver, they are frozen:; ```; opt = SeOptions(); solver = SeSolver(..., opt); opt['...'] = ... # Ok, but solver has a copy and is unaffected.; solver.options['...'] = ... # Error; solver.options = opt; ```; This is because changing options without the solver knowing will not take effect. I removed saving / storing options for now. It was mostly used to store openmp threshold, which is not supported.; I also propose to write the stored options as python code when we restore it. (`options = eval(repr(options))`, we may have some issue with circular import if called from `__init__.py`, but we can just write the `repr` of the `dict`.).

Availability," in the previous section: [kraus_valgrind.txt](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/files/6370180/kraus_valgrind.txt) (note I filtered out like 30,000 errors that stem from Python's internal memory management - they're nothing to worry about, they're just what happens when you have your own allocator). The important part is. ```; ==54133== Invalid write of size 8; ==54133== at 0x10AFAFA8A: ???

Obviously I don't have the debugging symbols for MKL, so it's pretty hard to say where exactly it's coming from, but it is at least clearly inside that library. I ran `valgrind` on the `Malloc.py` file above, and get the exact same invalid write, which is promising. So the most likely public Python call is `scipy.linalg.eig`. ## Minimal reproducer. Ok, so now let me cut it down to a minimum `eig.py`:. ```python; import numpy as np; import scipy.linalg. x = np.random.rand(25, 25) + 1j*np.random.rand(25, 25); scipy.linalg.eig(x); ```. Note that this file does not even use `qutip`. You can run `PYTHONMALLOC=pymalloc_debug python -Xfaulthandler,tracemalloc eig.py`, and it will occasionally trigger a segfault (it happens to me about 1 in 5 times). It's not always the same message as above, e.g.:; ```; jake@tauros$ PYTHONMALLOC=pymalloc_debug python -Xfaulthandler,tracemalloc eig.py; python(54517,0x10a5505c0) malloc: Incorrect checksum for freed object 0x7fe6cb4150e0: probably modified after being freed.; Corrupt value: 0x3ff0000000000000; python(54517,0x10a5505c0) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug; Abort trap: 6; ```.

Availability," it is in the scope of qutip to try and make that easier, or guide users to do that. The philosophy here is, if the user can get the `mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor` to work, then they can also use `mpi_pmap` in qutip. However, I did show in the tutorial notebook explicitly as an example how it works on the RIKEN cluster, and I refer to the mpi4py users guide. That being said, we do want to set up an automated test for this, and we do want to understand what went wrong in our initial attempts to set up those tests. The two main problems we encountered were (a) if mpi4py is installed with pip, all mpi_pmap calls hang; (b) if it is installed with conda, test_map_pass_error hangs sometimes.; The difference between pip and conda comes from the fact that mpi4py requires an MPI implementation. If we use mpi4py's GH workflow to install it with pip, it installs MPICH, and with conda, it installs OpenMPI by default. I noticed that in both cases where mpi_pmap hangs, there *are* error messages, but they are captured by pytest and then never printed because the program hangs... Regarding problem (a), in short, it looks like an MPICH bug to me. I thus decided to use OpenMPI instead, and added `conda install ""openmpi<5"" mpi4py` to just one of our test runs (the python 3.12 one). Regarding problem (b), the problem was that we requested more processes than the default number of slots available. With OpenMPI, the default number of slots available is the number of physical cpu cores (which seems to be 2 on the machine running our tests, leaving only one slot for a worker process). In the `parallel` module, if num_cpus is not provided, it defaults to `available_cpu_count()` (which is 4 on this machine, since there are 4 logical cpus). We could try to find a better default value for num_cpus for mpi_pmap, but I feel like writing that well would require deeper MPI knowledge than I have. What I did instead is, I tried to make it clear in the documentation that the default value might be ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2296#issuecomment-1923102432:1177,error,error,1177,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2296#issuecomment-1923102432,2,['error'],['error']
Availability," me that `hasattr` in qutip's BLAS support tests is returning false positives and false negatives. It indicates if the attribute was defined, even though it might be empty. Would it be better to replace; ```; hasattr(config,'openblas_info'); ```; in qutip/utilities.py with; ```; hasattr(config,'openblas_info') and config.openblas_info; ```; likewise for blas_mkl_info (not mkl_info) ?. This would be similar to numpy's own usage in `np.show_config()` (i.e. `np.__config__.py.show()`), which [uses](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/3b7672ebd16982b661b8fbcabac80158662a8784/numpy/__config__.py.in#L116) `if not info_dict` to print ""NOT AVAILABLE"". ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; import numpy; numpy.show_config(). import qutip; qutip.about(); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; $ python3; Python 3.10.9 (main, Dec 7 2022, 13:47:07) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux; Type ""help"", ""copyright"", ""credits"" or ""license"" for more information.; >>> import numpy; >>> numpy.show_config(); ...; blas_mkl_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; ...; openblas_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; accelerate_info:; NOT AVAILABLE; ...; blas_info:; libraries = ['blas', 'blas']; library_dirs = ['/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu']; include_dirs = ['/usr/local/include', '/usr/include']; language = c; define_macros = [('HAVE_CBLAS', None)]; blas_opt_info:; define_macros = [('NO_ATLAS_INFO', 1), ('HAVE_CBLAS', None)]; libraries = ['blas', 'blas']; library_dirs = ['/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu']; include_dirs = ['/usr/local/include', '/usr/include']; language = c; >>> ; >>> import qutip; >>> qutip.about(); ...; BLAS Info: OPENBLAS; ```. ### Expected Behaviour. The qutip declaration of BLAS support should match the numpy declaration.

Availability," means that if the global option `auto_tidyup` is set to `True` (its default), then small values (< 1e-15) are truncated from the output matrices. This generally ends up with ""neater"" looking matrices when output; there are far fewer numbers like `1 + 4.516584e-17j` reported, when that's basically just `1`. There are, however, a couple of problems because of this. The first is speed; after every (very simple)_ operation, such as `matmul` or `add`, the tidier runs on the matrix. This typically has `O(nnz)` complexity for sparse matrices, and `O(n * n)` complexity for a dense square matrix with `n` rows. This adds very significant overhead on to simple operations. Second is numerical precision. By dropping small terms, we are effectively turning numerical imprecision into a ""feature"" as opposed to a bug. Because QuTiP 5 uses the new data-layer to do most of its operations, rather than constructing intermediary `Qobj` instances, many mathematical operations will not give the same result if the data layer is used directly compared to if `Qobj` is used at every step. For example, let's say we have three random `Qobj`:; ```python; a, b, c = [qutip.rand_herm(5) for _ in [None]*3]; ```; Now, in general,; ```python; a + b + c != qutip.Qobj(a.data + b.data + c.data); ```; because `a + b + c` will invoke the `tidyup` code twice, whereas the right-hand side will not invoke it at all. This means that despite the fact that `Qobj.__add__` uses the data-layer addition underneath, there will be numerical differences using the QuTiP default settings. I suspect these sort of problems are behind the recent test instabilities on `dev.major` with regards to tolerances. ----. My vote is for a removal of `auto_tidyup`, or at the very least, changing the default value of the option to `False`. We still want nice values for display, so perhaps we could consider having an option to produce a tidied up copy when calling `__repr__`, instead?.

Error mitigation in QuTiP; From the QuTiP 4.5 release, the qutip.qip module now contains the noisy quantum circuit simulator (which was a GSoC project) providing enhanced features for a pulse-level description of quantum circuits and noise models. A new class `Processor` and several subclasses are added to represent different platforms for quantum computing. They can transfer a quantum circuit into the corresponding control sequence and simulate the dynamics with QuTiP solvers. Different noise models can be added to `qutip.qip.noise` to simulate noise in a quantum device. This module is still young and many features can be improved, including new device models, new noise models and integration with the existing general framework for quantum circuits (`qutip.qip.circuit`). There are also possible applications such as error mitigation techniques [1-3]. The tutorial notebooks can be found at http://qutip.org/tutorials.html#nisq. A recent presentation on the FOSDEM conference may help you get an overview (https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/quantum_qutip/). See also the Github Project page for a collection of related issues and ongoing Pull Requests. ### Expected outcomes; - More devices defined in the `qutip.qip.device` module. At the moment, we have two models: spin chain and cavity QED. We would like to include some other commonly used planform such as Superconducting system, Ion trap system or silicon system. Each model will need a new set of control hamiltonian and a compiler that find the control pulse of a quantum gate. This part is gonna involve some physics and study of commonly used hardware platforms. The related code can be found in `qutip.qip.device` and `qutip.qip.compiler`; - Refactoring the circuit compiler to allow simple pulse scheduling, e.g. Restriction one pulses that can",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1184#issuecomment-590737940:1161,error,error,1161,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1184#issuecomment-590737940,2,['error'],['error']

Currently this example raises: ; ""TypeError: incompatible dimensions [[2], [2]] and [[1], [1]]""; as `__mul__(self, other)` defaults to `__matmul__(self, other)` when `other` is not an instance of `numbers.Number`. . If instead we do:; ```python; complex_number*qobj; ```; The error raised is:; ""TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'Qobj'""; This error is different because `__rmul__` checks first for `other` being an instance of `numbers.Number` and if not, it raises `NotImplementedError`. It does not check whether `Qobj(other)` works. I would say this is undesired and that `__rmul__` should try first converting `other` into `Qobj` and not assume that other is already `Qobj`. . **Describe the solution you'd like**; I would like to suggest either:; 1) changing the behaviour of `matmul` dispatcher so that (1,1) shaped data is multiplied element wise by default. However this, although not terrible, it breaks conceptually what matmul is, as a (1,1) x (2,2) matrix multiplication can not happen. 2) Allow `mul` dispatcher to have as input a `Data` object. In this way we would raise an error when the `Data` for `mul` dispatcher is not of shape (1,1) and perform an elementwise multiplication when it is. I am not sure how difficult it is to code this. 3) Create `mul_elementwise` dispatcher to have as input two `Data` objects and perform elementwise multiplication. Another change that I would like to suggest is to add a check in `__rmul__` to see if `other` can be represented as a Qobj. . These two changes should probably go in a different PR. _Edit: added third option_",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1607:1637,error,error,1637,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1607,1,['error'],['error']

I was just trying to play around with this. . > If we're going to do this (and we haven't decided if we will yet), we're going to need to get a lot of wide-ranging input from many different libraries. I completely agree with your approach. I’m simply trying to push for this to be something that will come out in a reasonable timeframe and not be something forgotten. > We've got to be concerned with backwards and forwards compatibility; what if a user wants to install and use QuTiP and a different library in the same environment without using them together, but can't even have them coexist because of version incompatibilities in optional conversion features?. I do understand your point, and I see how you want to be backward and forward compatible, however I don’t think that my proposal would break different tools in the same environment. What I propose would simply prevent `qutip.Qobj(otherlibraryobject)` from working (with an explicative error message) if `otherlibrary` does not support the same qobj interface version. Everything else would work the same. You can still import and use the two libraries independently without issues. It’s indeed possible to design around this and supporting at the same time different versions of the interface, however, and there’s value in doing so. > To me, this is absolutely one of the mistakes that Numpy made in their implementation, and we shouldn't be copying it. I don't know enough of the history behind numpy current api, but I see your point. however I'd like to reiterate that this is not what I am proposing. ; I think there is considerable difference between supporting arbitrary operations `new_obj = Qobj + netket_operator*5` (though if you are going to export dispatch hooks in `5.0`, this would be possible in a consistent way, I think) and `qutip.mesolve(netket_operator, ...)`. ; In the first, I do agree with your point that the nature python's `__add__/__radd__` is not commutative, leading",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-830113742:1963,error,error,1963,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-830113742,2,['error'],['error']

I'm now reasonably convinced that this isn't directly an issue with QuTiP. I suspect it isn't an issue with `scipy` either, but I'm not sure - it looks like a slight overwrite in MKL on macOS, though it's also possible that `scipy` passes some invalid pointers when dropping down to BLAS/LAPACK. I get the impression that the next steps involve dropping down a level of abstraction, down to Cython to directly call scipy's wrappers, or even fully down to C and link directly against MKL.

Availability,"### Bug Description. Adding (or subtracting) a number from a ket modifies the data of the ket even without an assignment. In the code below, I would expect that `a` is not modified when the expression `a+1` is run, but it is. That is to say, `a+1` has the same effect as `a+=1`. In contrast, the data of the QObj does not change when adding a number to an operator or when multiplying a ket by a number. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; from qutip import basis; a = basis(2); print(a); print(); print(a+1); print(); print(a); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = (2, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[1.]; [0.]]. Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = (2, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[2.]; [0.]]. Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = (2, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[2.]; [0.]]; ```. ### Expected Behaviour. First of all, adding a number to a ket is not a well-defined operation, so perhaps it should throw an error. However, I think that the value of `a+1` is not entirely unexpected, so it could be kept. The real issue is that the data of `a` is modified without the code ever explicitly reassigning `a`. This is definitely unexpected. I would expect the output to be:. `Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = (2, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[1.]; [0.]]. Quantum object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = (2, 1), type = ket; Qobj data =; [[2.]; [0.]].

Create a `rho0` for mesolve to use with the flat array while explicitly specifying the matrix dimensions in the `dims` parameter. Upon passing the density matrix to `mesolve` a segmentation fault occurs. A simple proof of concept is included below. `np.random.random` was used to fill the matrix in this case, but the issue was encountered using valid density matricies, and the issue seems to be unrelated to whether the matrix is valid or not as a density matrix. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; import qutip as qtip; import numpy as np. dim = 100 # Small dims don't work. I assume python has some buffer after the array; H = qtip.Qobj(np.identity(dim),dims=[[dim],[dim]]); rho0 = np.random.random([dim**2]); rho0 = qtip.Qobj(rho0.flatten(),dims=[[dim],[dim]]) # This fails; # rho0 = qtip.Qobj(rho0.reshape([dim,dim]),dims=[[dim],[dim]]) # This works; qtip.mesolve(rho0=rho0,H=H,tlist=np.linspace(0,10,1),progress_bar=qtip.ui.EnhancedTextProgressBar()); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; [ 0% ] Elapsed 0.00s / Remaining 00:00:00:00[1] 3281154 segmentation fault (core dumped); ```. ### Expected Behaviour.

Key feature of ENR states is that dims and shape do not match, which can cause issues if dims and not shape are used in various operations.

Hi,; I've been trying to find the propagator for a time-dependent hamiltonian (with time-dependent collapse operators as well), and have been getting an error saying that the t_list lengths do not match in Qutip 5.0. I also tried to run it without using the collapse operators, but I get the same issue. The same code runs in Qutip 4.7. My goal is to actually find two-time correlation functions of a time-dependent operator (following this paper:https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.102.023717). What I did do (and what has worked) is decompose the operator into time-independent parts and then use Qutip's correlation_2op_2t. This takes a really long time, since I need to do this for 8 different pairs of operators. I thought of instead finding the propagator and manually finding the correlation using it instead. . From the code below, you can see that mesolve works, but the propagator doesn't. . ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; gamma_1d_1 = Gamma; gamma_1d_2 = Gamma; ## Input pulse; u = input_pulse; mod_u_2 = np.abs(u)**2; integral_u_2 = np.cumsum(mod_u_2) * t[1]; g_u = np.conjugate(u)/np.sqrt(1 - integral_u_2). ## Hamiltonian; emitter_dims = 3; mode_dims = 7; a = 1.1; psi_coherent = coherent(mode_dims, a); ## Mode dims is defined above; w0_1 = 2 * np.pi * 0; alpha_1 = 2 * np.pi * 0.3; w0_2 = 2 * np.pi * 0; alpha_2 = 2 * np.pi * 0.3; gamma_intrinsic = 2 * np.pi * 0.0. sig_1 = tensor(destroy(emitter_dims), qeye(emitter_dims), qeye(mode_dims)); sig_2 = tensor(qeye(emitter_dims), destroy(emitter_dims), qeye(mode_dims)); a_u = tensor(qeye(emitter_dims), qeye(emitter_dims), destroy(mode_dims)).

Availability,"### Bug Description. I try to use `mesolve` to do a system dynamics with a system static Hamiltonian `H_0` under a driving term governed by a cosine shape waveform `cos_waveform`. . We try to method to construct the dynamical hamiltonain `H_d` in two ways: one is `H_d = [H_0, [a_dag + a, cos_waveform]]` and `H_d = [H_0, [a_dag + a, cos_waveform_array]]`, corresponding to `[ops, func]` and `[ops, ndarray]` cases, respectively. You can see from the code I provided, the cos_waveform_array is given by `drive_pulse_y = np.array([cos_waveform(t, None) for t in tlist], dtype=np.complex128)`. We expect the simulation result of the system should be the same under these two cases. We plot the diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix to see the dynamics of the system. But the result are different. I try to find the issue probably happens due to function `mesolve._qobjevo_set` or the different treatments in `QobjEvo.ops` as it contains a string `""func""` and `""ndarray""` in our cases, and the `""ndarray""` case has some code errors. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; from qutip import *; import numpy as np; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt. # Define the pulse. t_rising = 15 # ns; t_g = t_rising + 150; phase = 0; freq = 6.3; ampli = -0.2 * 2*np.pi; t_delay = 0. def cos_waveform(t, args):; t_relative = t - t_delay; if t_relative < 0: ; return 0; if 0 <= t_relative <= t_rising:; return ampli/2 * np.cos(freq * np.pi * 2 * t_relative + phase)* (1 - np.cos(np.pi * t_relative / t_rising)) ; if t_rising < t_relative < t_g - t_rising:; return ampli * np.cos(freq * np.pi * 2 * t_relative); if t_g - t_rising <= t_relative <= t_g:; return ampli/2 * np.cos(freq * np.pi * 2 * t_relative + phase)* (1 - np.cos(np.pi * ( t_relative - t_g + 2 * t_rising)/t_rising)); if t_g < t_relative: ; return 0. # Setup a single transmon; N = 4; w = 6.3; alpha = -0.3. a = destroy(N); a_dag = a.dag().

Availability,"### Bug Description. I updated some old code from v4.7 to v5 this week and found some examples of brmesolve which were substantially slower... going from 30 seconds to 15+ minutes. Fiddling around a little I narrowed it down to at least one issue (though there may be others). This is particularly tricky because I also have examples which are substantially faster in v5. The one issue I found was that bloch_redfield_tensor() always returns a dense bloch-redfield tensor, even if you set br_type to sparse. It does return a sparse one if fock_basis=false, which points at the issue being; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/0b4260e821cf4d095df6fa02ea5a71bc0655516c/qutip/core/_brtensor.pyx#L281; so this call to from_eigbasis() in _brtools always returning a dense object; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/0b4260e821cf4d095df6fa02ea5a71bc0655516c/qutip/core/_brtools.pyx#L290. if i manually convert the tensor back to sparse again, and use it, it speeds up these hard cases by a factor of 5 or 6. Not sure if it resolves my original 30seconds -> 15 minutes problem completely, will check a bit more. In some sense this relates to the old issue of how broadly default_dtype should be applied, but here it seems more specific in that one requests a sparse tensor and gets a dense one. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; R = bloch_redfield_tensor(H, [[Q, Lor]], fock_basis=True, sparse_eigensolver=True, br_dtype='sparse'); print(R.dtype); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; <class 'qutip.core.data.dense.Dense'>; ```. ### Expected Behaviour.

I also tried it for `SSESolver`, but the same error message occurs. I use qutip 5.0.3. I took the example from the documentation as a minimal working example. I also tried `step` for the `MESolver` class and there it works. I think it should also not only output the state but also the measurement output if possible.

Availability,"### Bug Description. In the current documentation I cannot find anywhere how the underdamped spectral density for the HEOM module (i.e. `UnderDampedBath`) is defined. While for the `gamma` and `w0` parameters this is quite straightforward, different authors use very different conventions in the prefactors multiplying the spectral density (factors of two, pi, gamma, w0, etc.). This makes it very hard to understand how the `lam` parameter is exactly defined. Having a proper understanding of the `lam` parameter is quite essential to properly compare with the results obtained via other methods. I think it would be quite useful to explicitly write down the mathematical formula of the spectral density being used in the documentation. In the mean time, I would also appreciate if anyone with knowledge of the proper definition would be kind enough to share it here. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. _No response_. ### Code Output. _No response_. ### Expected Behaviour.

Availability,"### Bug Description. Running `import qutip` eagerly imports `scipy.fft` via `qutip.correlation`, causing all native dependencies of `scipy.fft`'s fftpack-based implementation to load. In particular when using SciPy 1.8.1 on Linux, fftpack requires `GLIBCXX_3.4.30` but contains a private copy of `GLIBCXX_3.4.29` such that the import fails unless another Python package provides its own implementation of `GLIBCXX_3.4.30` (typically, PyZMQ via `jupyter-client`).

Availability,"### Bug Description. The `plot_spin_distribution_2d` function allows to project a spin distribution function from the surface of a unit sphere to the unit disk. QuTiP uses `matplotlib.pyplot.pcolor` to perform this task and calculates a meshgrid `X, Y` to plot the function to. Due to some changes in `matplotlib` the current implementation is deprecated and will return errors in a few minor releases. We could quickly fix this by passing `shading='auto'` to the call of `ax.pcolor()` in the [visualization.py](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/82c6704c6fea8a2801492865ad1ef7c1d73c8840/qutip/visualization.py#L1313). However, this raises another UserWarning that the center points are not monotonically sorted. The cleanest way to fix this bug would be to pass the edges of the quadrilaterals to `pcolor()`. But we can not calculate them exactly from the given points in `theta, phi`. Hence, we would need to redesign the interface to this function and to related functions like `plot_spin_distribution_3d` and `spin_q_function`. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; import qutip as qt; import numpy as np; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt. j = 5; psi = qt.spin_coherent(j, np.random.rand() * np.pi, np.random.rand() * 2 * np.pi); rho = qt.ket2dm(psi). theta = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 50); phi = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 50). Q, THETA, PHI = qt.spin_q_function(psi, theta, phi); fig, ax = qt.plot_spin_distribution_2d(Q, THETA, PHI); plt.show(); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: shading='flat' when X and Y have the same dimensions as C is deprecated since 3.3.

Availability,"### Bug Description. The `propagator()` function SHOULD support the array-coefficient format:. `propagator(H=[[sigmax(), np.cos(tlist)]], tlist=tlist)`. However, this code generates an error complaining `ValueError: tlist must be the same len as the array to interpolate`. This is due to a line of wrong code inside `propagator()` function:. ```python; def propagator(H, t, c_ops=(), args=None, options=None, **kwargs):; if isinstance(t, numbers.Real):; tlist = [0, t]; list_output = False; else:; tlist = t; list_output = True. if not isinstance(H, (Qobj, QobjEvo)):; H = QobjEvo(H, args=args, **kwargs); ...; ```. In the last line above, the code forgot to pass `tlist=tlist` to `QobjEvo`. This is an optional argument only required when no coefficients are supplied as numpy arrays. Therefore, when we feed a numpy array to `propagator` and then to `QobjEvo`, it is reported `ValueError: tlist must be the same len as the array to interpolate`, while the real error here is because no tlist is provided. You can compare it to the correct code in `mesolve`:. ```python; def mesolve(H, rho0, tlist, c_ops=None, e_ops=None, args=None, options=None, **kwargs):; options = _solver_deprecation(kwargs, options); H = QobjEvo(H, args=args, tlist=tlist); ...; ```. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; tlist = np.linspace(0, 50, 500); q.propagator([[q.sigmax(), np.cos(tlist)]], tlist); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------; ValueError Traceback (most recent call last); Cell In[26], line 2; 1 tlist = np.linspace(0, 50, 500); ----> 2 q.propagator([[q.sigmax(), np.cos(tlist)]], tlist).states[-1].

Availability,"### Bug Description. qutip has functions to detect the available of BLAS libraries. For instance on my system (debian unstable), `python3 -c ""import qutip; qutip.about()""` reports; ```; BLAS Info: OPENBLAS; ```. However, I think the logic behind BLAS Info is not robust. For context, debian builds packages against generic libblas.so (libblas-dev package). The various optimised BLAS implementations are supposed to be binary compatible, such that the system administrator can install the preferred implementation for use at runtime (the identity of libblas.so is controlled using debian's alternatives mechanism). On my system, OpenBLAS is indeed installed. But taking a closer look, I'm not sure it was detected for the right reason.; The blas configuration is identified by the `_blas_info()` function in qutip/utilities.py. It uses the local numpy configuration (`np.__config`), testing the availability of various attributes in the numpy config, in the form of ; ```; if hasattr(config,'mkl_info') ...; elif hasattr(config,'openblas_info'); ```. MKL was not used to build debian's numpy package, and I don't have it installed. So mkl_info is not detected.

Availability,"### Bug Description. setup.py manages a `--with-openmp` build option to provide openmp support. pyproject.toml was introduced in QuTiP 4.6.0 to allow PEP517 build without (directly) using setup.py. But the `--with-openmp` option that previously worked with a setup.py build does not seem to be compatible with a PEP517 build. The problem shows up in the Debian build of the qutip package. Debian provides its own tool (pybuild from the dh-python package) to manage the build of python packages. PEP517 is relatively new, so by default pybuild uses setup.py if it is available. pybuild will use PEP517 instead, if the pybuild-plugin-pyproject package is installed and pyproject.toml is available. Without pybuild-plugin-pyproject installed, the Debian build was invoking; ```; /usr/bin/python3.10 setup.py build --with-openmp; ```; using setup.py and specifying `--with-openmp`. A successful build log for this method can be found at https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=qutip&arch=amd64&ver=4.6.2-3&stamp=1641397514&raw=0. With pybuild-plugin-pyproject installed, the Debian build invokes a wheel build (command line given below). But `--with-openmp` causes the build to fail. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; python3.10 -m build --skip-dependency-check --no-isolation --wheel --outdir /build/qutip/.pybuild/cpython3_3.10_qutip --with-openmp; ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; usage: python -m build [-h] [--version] [--sdist] [--wheel] [--outdir OUTDIR] [--skip-dependency-check] [--no-isolation] [--config-setting CONFIG_SETTING] [srcdir]; python -m build: error: unrecognized arguments: --with-openmp; ```. ### Expected Behaviour.

I'm using ntraject = 10 or 100. I've tried with and without improved sampling. . When I use a jump rate less than 2, the number of jumps I see in each trajectory goes up with the jump rate. However for a jump rate of 4 or higher, the number of jumps I see in each trajectory goes down with jump rate. (I realize that for the Lindblad equation to be a good approximation, the interaction hamiltonian (and thus jump rate) should be small compared to the system Hamiltonian, but I still want to understand this behavior.). Can anybody explain why a higher jump rate doesn't give more jumps in a trajectory? . Also, I'd like to understand result.photocurrent, which seems to combine the jumps for all trajectories, but also seems to divide by the number of trajectories, and maybe the number of timesteps?.

Availability,"### Describe the Issue!. With the PR for adding `hypothesis` #1957, we have the issue of how we should handle the `NaN` and `inf`. I see 3 main ways:; - Up to now, we mostly ignored them. They rarely caused any issues. We could continue like this. Maybe adding a `isfinite` function and fixing `iszero`; - Do as @hodgestar did in #1957, propagate the `NaN` as blas does. We could still add `isfinite`.; - Raise an error when a `Data` is not finite as soon as possible. I prefer raising an error as soon as a bad value is obtained. Otherwise computation can continue for a while, hiding the source of the issue and wasting time. Even when the `NaNs` are properly propagated, it's often not that helpful when debugging.; Failing as soon as the bad value is obtained will make debugging the easiest. I looked at all the places that would need to check for bad values:; Creation: `dense.pyx`'s, `csr.pyx`'s, `one_element`, `diag`.; Modification: `project`, `ptrace`, `kron`.; Operation: `add`, `mul`, `matmul`.; The other functions either don't create a `Data` object or use one of the previous function (`pow` use `matmul`, `eigen` uses `Dense.__init__`, etc.). I believe that we should check at creation, even if we otherwise mostly ignore bad values.; Adding check in `project`, `ptrace`, `kron` shouldn't be too costly. The issue is we want the operations `add`, `mul`, `matmul` to be fast, so checking after each call would not be great. But if we keep track of the largest element, it could only cost one extra addition or multiplication, which could be fast enough to make refusing `inf` and `NaN` in `Qobj` doable.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1977:414,error,error,414,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1977,2,['error'],['error']

Availability,"### Problem Description. Now that qutip-qip has moved to another package, gates are not available in the main repo. This is inconvenient for examples such as the control optimization ones, where one would need to install the qutip-qip package just to access say the Hadamard or CNOT for instance. ### Proposed Solution. The easiest solution would be just to copy the `gates.py` file from the QIP package into the main repo. Perhaps might confuse imports in qip? Also, I think that file has func defs that refer to 'controls' that might not make sense in this repo. ### Alternate Solutions. Have a file called `operations.py`. Just have a subset of the gates (operations), the most typical named unitaries - sounds less QIP like and would avoid import confusion. I think also `hadamard_transform` could be shortened to `hadamard`, but also include the original name. ### Additional Context. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2389:88,avail,available,88,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2389,1,['avail'],['available']

Right now, if you pass a [pathlib.Path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to any of two functions above, an error will raise because it is not possible to add the suffix `.qu` to a Path object. Moreover, if you already have the fullpath of the file (including the extension), QuTip will also raise because it appends the extension internally, no matter if it is already there or not. ### Proposed Solution.

Availability,"### Problem Description. There are a few issues with graphic capacities in Qutip. 1. Most are not tested. Only Bloch.py has some tests associated. While testing graphs is not evident, matplotlib has testing functions to compare graphs etc. and just running it to ensure that no errors are raised would be a nice start. Here are some files and their coverage:; - tomography.py 50%; - visualization.py 8%; - distribution.py 23%; - bloch.py 55%; - bloch3d.py 8%. 2. The interface is not uniform. Most functions take 'fig' and 'ax', but `hilton` only takes 'ax' but no 'fig'. Maybe one third of the function in visualization accepts 'title' and half a 'figsize'. The order of these options is also inconsistent, 'fig', 'ax' can be the first parameters or the last... As seen in #1573, some want more control so `matrix_histogram` accepts `options`. I am all for more control, but being available for only one function feels wrong. On the bloch side, there is a mismatch between `add_vectors`, `add_points`, which takes `color` and `alpha` as input, and `add_arc`, `add_line` which takes `**kwargs`. 3. The colorblind mode should works everywhere, but presently only `hilton` support it. ### Proposed Solution. So for v5 release, the interface of all these should be clean and uniform, with proper tests. . ### Alternate Solutions. _No response_. ### Additional Context. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1910:278,error,errors,278,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1910,2,"['avail', 'error']","['available', 'errors']"
Availability,"### Problem Description. `master` has qutip/qutip/cy/openmp/src/[zspmv_openmp.hpp](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/cy/openmp/src/zspmv_openmp.hpp), for csr @ dense product with openmp, but we did not have the time to add when making the data layer for `dev.major`. In v4, to use openmp, the user needs to compile from source locally with `python setup.py install --with-openmp` and then an option has to be passed to the solver at run time to use it. For v5, it would be great if openMP was part of the Data layer and used without much thought by the user. (No need to pass `Options(use_openmp=True)` to `mesolve`). We would probably keep a flag and threshold as an option in core or settings so we can run tests with and without. We should add support for cython's `prange`. Presently, using it breaks mac's tests. If made available, there are quite a few functions for the data layer that could gain from it. While openmp is available in v4, it was not used much since it can only be used when compiling locally and the options isn't well known. Ideally, it would be packaged in the wheels (for all but Mac?) instead of needing a local installation. However it does not seems easy, [scipy decided against it](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/38261c1141b8aa80bceeef419911fb4f31df5372/doc/source/dev/toolchain.rst#openmp-support), because it does not mix well with [other parallel environments](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/10239#issuecomment-795030817). It may be possible with conda since it has a openmp package. . ### Proposed Solution. Tasks:; - Restore the compilation option for openmp and have `matmul_csr_dense_dense` use `zspmvpy_openmp`.; - Add options in core to control openmp. In `parallel_map`, turn it of when using multiprocessing.; - Add `prange` in a function (`mul_dense`) and ensure that tests passes and wheels build.; - Add `prange` elsewhere where useful. ### Alternate Solutions. _No response_. ### Additional Context. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1904:841,avail,available,841,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1904,2,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"'; ```; and a lot of functionality will break - anything that requires `Qobj.eigenstates()` for example. This is because `Qobj` defines `__array__`, one of numpy's ""array interface"" functions, intended for classes that can be safely converted _implicitly_ into an `ndarray`. This isn't really the case for `Qobj` - it loses all sorts of information when you do that, which is why we've maintained the separate `Qobj.full()` for explicitly getting the dense matrix representation of a `Qobj`. This is not to mention that numpy ufuncs probably should not be able to implicitly convert `Qobj` - I'd strongly argue that `np.sin(qutip.basis(2, 1))` should be `TypeError`, _not_ `array([[0. +0.j], [0.84147098+0.j]])` (like it is right now). We actually already removed this ""functionality"" in `dev.major`. The most pressing incompatibility is that a few points in QuTiP put a few `Qobj` into a `np.array(dtype=object)`. In numpy 1.20, this no longer produces a 1D array of `Qobj`, but a 3D array of complex. This breaks `Qobj.eigenstates`, and prevents test collection due to it being present in `states.py::qutrit_basis()`, which is called during parametrisation. There are a two possible ways to solve this, and we ought to release a fix with one of them in a patch ASAP:; 1. remove `Qobj.__array__`; 2. remove all use of `Qobj` in `np.array`. I'm personally in favour of ""explicit is better than implicit"" in this case, i.e. removing `Qobj.__array__` and relying on `Qobj.full()`. As another example along this vein, note `scipy.sparse` matrices don't implement this either, and they're arguably closer to being safely coerced to `ndarray` than we are. ### Related issues. #938: feature request for implementing `__array__`. This only asks for `np.array(qobj)` as a convenience, acknowledging the availability of `Qobj.full()`.; #1017: includes a comment on buggy behaviour caused by `__array__`.

Most method are computed the same way as before, but the rouchon method no longer use super operator, but keep the density matrix as a matrix and not an oper-ket. - The derivative computation for used by the integration method has also been split into multiple functions and made only available for `smesolve`. For there methods to be valid, the each diffusion contribution must commute. For `smesolve`, this means that each `sc_ops` must commute, as documented. For `ssesolve`, each `sc_ops` must not only commute, but also commute with other `sc_ops`'s adjoint, this last part being missing from v4's documentation.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2131:386,avail,available,386,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2131,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"**Description**. Add capacity to merge stochastic solver results. While adding it found a few bugs/ issues with the merge and weight that I fixed:. - When one result had trajectories and the other did not, but both stored the states, the merged result had no states.; - When merging 2 results with default ratio, that ratio would depend on whether the `improved_sampling` options was used.; - When the no-jump probability was 1, the total weight as measured by `sum(res.runs_weight)` would not be one.; - A no-jump probability over 1 by numerical error would break the evolution.; - Error in the weight application in the `_target_tolerance_end`. The last 3 are easy fix. For the default weight when merging, using the `num_trajectories` instead of `_num_rel_trajectories` is enough.; But I tried the approach of not counting the no-jumb evolution as a trajectory. This has many small advantages:; - All `result.trajectories` are the same, the first few are not special. ; - All seeds are used.; - No confusing on the merging ratio.; - Keeping the absolute and relative weight apart simply part of the merging.; - The progress bar run up to the expected number. I also tired to simplify the weight management by accumulating per data then split by abs, rel. This makes it easier to add averaged data (nmmc's trace). Seeing the change in lines number in `multitrajresults.py` it seems to be about the same. I am also thinking of removing the weight from trajectories and making it only a multitraj property:; `multitraj.add((seed, traj, rel_weight))`; `multitraj.add_deterministic(traj, abs_weight)`. The marginal / trace would stay in the trajectory, but not merging those with weight feel simpler to me. @pmenczel ; This PR larger than I expected, do you want me to break it into smaller ones for review or are you fine like this.; What do you think about splitting the no-jump / abs traj from the normal ones?; What about having the weights in the `add` instead of the trajectories?",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2455:547,error,error,547,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2455,2,"['Error', 'error']","['Error', 'error']"

Availability,"**Description**. The aim of this project is to enhance the capabilities of qutip's HEOM implementation by introducing a set of tools that offer the option to simulate arbitrary spectral densities or correlation functions. . To achieve this the main idea is to fit our wanted spectral density by a set of underdamped Drude-Lorentz spectral densities or correlation functions. The idea is that the user will supply his desired spectral density or correlation function and the tools will automatically do the fit and construct the corresponding HEOM bath. Guesses ffor the fit and the number of terms will be decided automatically if the user does not specify them. To decided on the number of terms, we will used the normalized root mean square error as a measure of the goodness of the fit. . I also added functions to bosonic bath to quickly obtain the correlation function, power spectrum and spectral density for the existing bosonic baths . **Note**. Those tests fail because mpmath is not in the requirements, it is needed because the scipy version of the Rienmann zeta function doesn't take complex arguments (https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/9182). **Related issues or PRs**.

Availability,"**Description**; Add a `Solver` class for better task distribution in `sesolve` and `mesolve`. `sesolve`, `mesolve`, etc. are presently mostly independent: each create their time dependant system, the function to integrator with scipy's ode solver, loop over the `tlist` and store results. With this PR, the `[se/me]solve` functions will reuse most of the code and be more modular.; We already have a `Result` class to manage e_ops and store result, `Integrator` to solve the ode system. `QobjEvo` can support any time-dependant format we support. This PR introduce a new class `Solver` to join all these. Basis usage looks like:; ```; rhs = QobjEvo(...); solver = Solver(rhs, options=opt); result = solver.run(psi, tlist, e_ops=e_ops); result.expect; ```. It can also do step evolution:; ```; rhs = QobjEvo(...); solver = Solver(rhs, options=opt); solver.start(psi, t0); psi_t1 = solver.step(t1); psi_t2 = solver.step(t2, args=new_args) # Can be inefficient depending on integrator.; psi_t3 = solver.step(t3, options=new_opt) # Inefficient but supported.; ```; When stepping, the output is always the state as `Qobj`. The solver class promote ket state to density matrices when the rhs is a super-operator. `rhs` support `Qobj` and `QobjEvo`, but not list or function. This PR also add `MeSolver` and `SeSolver` classes, but they are very light:; `MeSolver(H, c_ops)` is equivalent to `Solver(liouvillian(H, c_ops))`. `Solver` store a list of available `Integrator` as a class property. `Solver.avail_integrator` has all integrators available to all solvers. `SeSolver.avail_integrator` has all these with those registered directly to `SeSolver`. This is to allow Integrator for specific system. We could think for the floquet sesolve method to be made into an integrator specific to `SeSolver`. .

Availability,"**Description**; Add the capacity of stochastic solver to run from know noise or measurements.; In the lab, the measurement can be obtained, but that measurements is a mix of and expectation values and noise. The stochastic solver can be used to split these components to study the system. The new method for this is `SMESolver.run_from_experiment`. It works similarly to `run` of deterministic solver: it compute a single trajectory. It can take either `dW` or `measurement` as the noise input. (`dW` is the default). `dW` input is available with every integration method, but measurement input is limited to `euler`, `milstein`, `pred_corr`, `platen`. The measurement is `expect(m_ops, state_t) + dW / dt`. For `run_from_experiment` it has no choice but to take `state_t` at the start of the interval, but for the result for `smesovle`, it was taken at the end of the interval. I updated the `store_measurement` options to allow the user the choose where it is taken between `start`, `end` and `middle`. When `start` is used, the `run`'s result's measurement can be feed back to `run_from_experiment` to recompute the same trajectory. (The theory is the integral of the expectation value over the interval.). Another change in this PR is to keep the dW in the wiener and result class.

Availability,"**Description**; Apply the changes to solver/result.py that were made previously for mcsolve in #1710. ; Also add other improvement to `Result`. Major changes:; - `Result.__init__` signature changed from `(e_ops, options, _super, oper_state)` to `(e_ops, options, tlist, state0)`.; To know if we can normalize the state, we use the first state's dims instead of asking for information about it.; The first `add` is done in the `__init__` call.; - `MultiTrajResult` and `MultiTrajResultAveraged` are merged into `MultiTrajResult`: both classes were be interchangeable but did not share code, so any modification needed to be done twice.; - Add capacity to compute trajectories until a tolerance is reached. A new feature in #1710 was to allow to compute trajectories until the error bars on the expectation values are under a certain tolerance. The `add` method compute the error bars using jackknife re-sampling and return an estimation of the number of trajectories still needed to reach the desired tolerance. The mapping function can then stop computing trajectories when this reach `0`.; - `McResult` was created: `collapse` and `photocurrent` are an output of `mcsolve` only. So these were removed from `MultiTrajResult` and move into `McResult`. Other changes:; - `MultiTrajResult.steady_state` is a function instead of a property. `steady_state` was the average of the states for all times. With long enough `tlist`, it should converge to the steady state, but the first times are usually far from it. As a function, it offer the possibility to average the last `N` states.; - When `e_ops` is a `Qobj`, `QobjEvo` or `callable`, the expect will not be a list but the array of expect:; `Result(e_ops=[num], ...).expect[0] == Result(e_ops=num, ...).expect`.; I am not too sure about that one, it feel logic but could break some codes. . **Related issues or PRs**; #1710",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1889:684,toler,tolerance,684,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1889,5,"['error', 'toler']","['error', 'tolerance']"

Availability,"**Description**; Looking at the [historical benchmarks](https://qutip.org/qutip-benchmark/ops/matmul.html), Qobj operations got slower last November, which correspond to when we merged the dimensions PR. This PR is to improve those graph. Usually, when a lot of matrix operations are done, we use the data layer object directly. So the overhead of the Qobj should not be that critical. Adding QobjEvo support to `isbra`, `isket`, etc, slowed them down quite a lot. The import of QobjEvo in the function can easily be slower than the matrix operation. (0.7us for the import which is the same as a 32x32 CSR@ket product.) This is the biggest culprit in the jump in the matmul benchmark graph. I added properties for each `is_type_` to Qobj and QobjEvo. The `Qobj` and `QobjEvo`'s `issuper` where not the same. `QobjEvo` would return `True` for oper-ket, not just super operator, while `Qobj.issuper` would be `True` only for super operator. `QobjEvo` now match `Qobj`. I also changed the check to tell if `Qobj.__matmul__` return a number or Qobj. It is now done looking at the output dimensions. Now that type cannot be overwritten, it is the same check. (Before a `[[1], [1]]` could be a bra, ket, oper, etc., now it's a scalar which return True to isbra, isket and isoper.). For `Qobj.__add__` I could speed it up by doing the Qobj check first. But the extra overhead of `Qobj.__init__` is still there.

This means that there will be two version of `cnot` etc. available. . - `qutip.enntropy.entangling_power` was also removed. While it was not strictly in the qip module, it is meant to be used for 2 qubits gates, so it felt more natural to be included there. - The target qubits options for measurement was removed. qip has it's own more specialized `Measurement` class, which I guess is the reference for such case. But we could make it stronger so that it can target various kind of subsystems, such as one site on a lattice or one of harmonic oscillator coupled to others, etc. Bonus: The `-Werror` for pytest was restored. **Related issues or PRs**; Checklist item in #1850. **Changelog**; Remove the qip submodule.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1890:410,avail,available,410,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1890,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"**Description**; Rewrite `mcsolve` as a class for dev.major.

For open systems. `H` must be a Liouvillian. The `c_ops` are computed stochasticly and are used for collapse. Dissipation terms to be used in a deterministic way can be added as Lindblad dissipators to the liouvillian.; - McSolver's results include the photocurrent.; - McSolver need a layer between the solver interface and the integrator. In #1710, this was a trajectory solver, but here I use a pseudo integrator.

Availability,"**Description**; Speed up and simplify `state_number_enumerate`, `state_number_index`, `state_index_number`, `state_number_qobj`, and `enr_state_dictionaries`. I've changed quite a few functions in states.py, but all the changes are small. It seemed easier to combine this into a single pull request instead of splitting it up into many smaller ones (but this could be done). The changes in more detail:; - `state_number_enumerate` and `state_index_number` now always return tuples. Before, `state_number_enumerate` returned arrays for `excitations is None` and tuples otherwise, and `state_index_number` returned a list. For `excitations is None`, I realized that a simple call to `itertools.product` is enough, and is about 20x faster for a (relatively big) test case. It would be trivial to keep returning arrays instead of tuples here as before, but this slows the code down (quite significantly, in fact) and, in any case, returning arrays or tuples depending on whether `excitations` is set seems like an inconsistent interface, so I decided to make it consistent (and faster). I checked that the uses in the code base should not be affected. The algorithm used when the number of excitations is restricted is a slightly more elegant version of the one from my previous pull request (#1594), and is faster by another factor of 5 or more for the ""big"" test cases I looked at. ~~It is still recursive, but quite fast, and I did not find an elegant non-recursive algorithm.~~ I came up with an even faster non-recursive algorithm after all. It's arguably a bit less elegant, but I think still readable, and another 50% or so faster than the previous one (see the second commit below).; - `enr_state_dictionaries` now returns a dictionary and a list instead of two dictionaries. Before, `idx2state` was a dictionary with integer keys from 0 to nstates-1, which behaves essentially like a list.

Availability,"**Description**; Update HEOM for v5. Other changes:; - This resulted in a bit of a refactor of the Result class (#1907); - I found a few places where QobjEvo did not correctly set `.type` and fixed those (they were breaking the HEOM tests). Todos and questions:; - [X] Should HierarchyADOsState store ado_state as a Data object rather than a numpy array? (it can't be stored as a Data object because the ADOs have shape `n_ado, n, n` and the Data layer only supports 2-d arrays).; - [X] How should the ado_state be stored on a results object? In particular, how should the change in e_ops signature be handled (for the HEOM solver the e_ops callables also take the full ADO state). (implemented); - [X] What should be done with the steady_state method? I guess it can just stay. Should other solvers also have this? (it should just stay, I think); - [x] Recheck the time-dependent case. (I also simplified the time-dependent case so that the Liouvillian is never added and so doesn't have to be subtracted off).; - [X] The HEOM can't really take new QObjEvo arguments each time `run` is called because calculating the RHS again is quite expensive. Maybe something can be done? (implemented -- passing new args to .run is now supported); - [X] In the base solver the new options seem to be set after retrieving the integrator -- is this right? (fixed); - [X] Compare performance to the HEOM in 4.7. (looks faster, yay!); - [X] We could also implement `.start()` and `.step()` for the HEOMSolver. Not quite sure of the use case yet though. (implemented and tested -- the implementation came for free after sorting out having .run inherit from the base solver).; - [x] Add some direct tests for the QobjEvo type errors that have been fixed.; - [x] Moved solver into `qutip.solver.heom`. . **Related issues or PRs**; - One of the todos from #1850; - In #1907 the Result class was changed largely to support extension by the HEOMSolver. **Changelog**; Update HEOM for v5.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1869:1709,error,errors,1709,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1869,1,['error'],['errors']

Availability,"**Description**; `Options` and `SolverOptions` are objects that list all available options and pass them a solver. However in v5, with the choice of integrators, the supported options are not fixed. Most integration methods support `""atol""`, but `order` or `beta`, etc. are specific to some methods. SInce new integrators could be added by project such as qutip-cupy, `Options` can no longer be the place to list all supported options. It become little more that a dict. So I propose deprecating it. The documentation of `sesolve`, `mesolve`, etc. now list the options used by the solver and most common ode options and link the the integrator documentation. The class interface has the options property which document the options used by the solver and the integrators have the same. In the online documentation, the integrator api entries only contain the description of the method and the supported options. Since users don't need to call them directly, other methods are hidden and will be included in the dev documentation only. Usage will look like this, for functions:; ```; sesolve(H, psi, tlist, options={""store_states"": True, ""method"": ""lsoda"", ""atol"": 1e-5}); ```; and for the class interface:; ```; solver = SeSolver(H, options={""store_states"": True, ""method"": ""lsoda"", ""atol"": 1e-5}); solver.run(...); solver.options[""atol""] = 1e-9; solver.run(...) # run with the new tol.; solver.options = {""atol"": 1e-2} # only change the affected items. ; solver.run(...) # Also run with the new tol.; solver.options[""method""] = ""adams"" # reset all ode options, including ""atol"" supported by both.; solver.options = {""method"": ""bdf"", ""atol"": 1e-2} # reset all ode options then apply the new atol ; ```.

Availability,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**; In the device simulator of QuTiP (`qutip.qip.device`), a quantum computing device is characterized by the class `Processor` and its subclasses. It contains information about the available control pulses. In addition, a compiler is used to compile a set of universal quantum gates (e.g. RX, RY and ISWAP) into the corresponding control pulses. Together, they can automatically compiler an arbitrary quantum circuit into control pulses, create the time-dependent Hamiltonian representation and run the simulation using QuTiP solvers. However, in the current version, this compilation is done for each gate sequentially. At each time step, there is only one control pulse active. In practice, it is inefficient because usually several gates can be performed parallelly (e.g. X gate on qubit 0 and qubit 1). To make the compilation more practical, it is necessary to introduce a scheduler that schedules the control pulses. A similar example is https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/pulse.html#schedules. **Describe the solution you'd like**; There is existing research (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00023.pdf) on gate-level scheduling. It studies which gates can be performed at the same time. In the most general case, however, gate-level scheduling is not enough, since different gates often have different runtime (.e.g. CNOT usually takes longer time than X gate). Despite the difference, pulse-level scheduling can be done in a similar way as gate-level scheduling by generating a graph (see the reference above). The difference is that each pulse will have its own duration. The possible implementation in `qutip.qip` could be in two steps:; - Modernize the current compiler and create an `Instruction` class representing each compiled control instruction (pulse, qubit index, amplitude, duration).; - Implement the scheduling algorithm similar as in the above reference.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1243:246,avail,available,246,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1243,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"**Summary of what was done:**. - Changes in floquet_master_equation_rates to make it faster.; - Corrected transposition errors in _floquet_master_equation_tensor_ and changes to make it faster. I also removed a line so that the ME is solved in the interaction picture, this implies a different basis change in the _floquet_markov_mesolve_ function.; - Correction in _floquet_markov_mesolve_. As explained in the point above, the Floquet-Markov ME was not being solved in the interaction picture, therefore I modified _floquet_master_equation_tensor_ and modified the basis change in _floquet_markov_mesolve_.

For the moment, if this variable is not given and _floquet_basis=False_, then the density matrix or expectation values are returned in the interaction picture, in the computational basis, and a warning message is sent. ; - Added integration options in: _floquet_modes, floquet_modes_t, floquet_modes_table, floquet_states_t, floquet_modes_t, floquet_wavefunction_t, fsesolve, floquet_master_equation_rates, fmmesolve_; - Added test functions to verify the dissipative dynamics:; a) Compare _fmmesolve_ and _mesolve_ for the cases: (NO drive but dissipation) and (Drive but NO dissipation); b) Compare numerical and analytical matrix elements for a driven-dissipative TLS with RWA.

Availability,"- I agree that renaming the _inner_point_color variable is a good idea. - The case you mention of black point_color with style 'l' also occurs in V4 and is solved by defining the variable as a list, e.g., ['black'] (which also works with the changes I proposed). So basically I assumed it was an expected use case. - I asked this question about style 's' plotting two colors in issue #1974, since we are given the same colors for style 's' and 'm', and Neil suggested leaving it as is. The docstring in the add_points function already tells you to give a single color for style 's' and a list of colors for style 'm'. - The error you get using style 'm' with two colors is that you need to specify a color for each point (you have to pass to the function a list of colors of the same length as the length of the points). In view of this, I don't know which approach you prefer to apply, as it depends on the expected use case.

Should install `qutip` without errors. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTip Version: 4.7.0; Python version: 3.11.0; `packaging` version: 22.0; `pip` version: 22.3.1; ```. ### Additional Context. I explicitly mention Python 3.11 because I failed to replicate the issue on a fresh Python 3.10 environment. . EDIT: Looking deeper into the [qutip built distributions](https://pypi.org/project/qutip/#files), the reason why this is failing only for Python 3.11 is because earlier versions of Python have built distributions, unlike Python 3.11. . This indicates that building the wheel from source is generally broken, which I confirmed by forcing an installation from source on Python 3.10 with; ```bash; pip install qutip --no-cache-dir --no-binary :all:; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2036:2589,error,error,2589,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2036,2,['error'],"['error', 'errors']"

Availability,". I post it here so if anyone finding it nice could copy it to the Wiki page. I add some details based on the original description:. -----------------------------------; ## 1. Error mitigation in QuTiP; From the QuTiP 4.5 release, the qutip.qip module now contains the noisy quantum circuit simulator (which was a GSoC project) providing enhanced features for a pulse-level description of quantum circuits and noise models. A new class `Processor` and several subclasses are added to represent different platforms for quantum computing. They can transfer a quantum circuit into the corresponding control sequence and simulate the dynamics with QuTiP solvers. Different noise models can be added to `qutip.qip.noise` to simulate noise in a quantum device. . This module is still young and many features can be improved, including new device models, new noise models and integration with the existing general framework for quantum circuits (`qutip.qip.circuit`). There are also possible applications such as error mitigation techniques [1-3]. The tutorial notebooks can be found at http://qutip.org/tutorials.html#nisq. A recent presentation on the FOSDEM conference may help you get an overview (https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/quantum_qutip/). See also the Github Project page for a collection of related issues and ongoing Pull Requests. ### Expected outcomes; - More devices defined in the `qutip.qip.device` module. At the moment, we have two models: spin chain and cavity QED. We would like to include some other commonly used planform such as Superconducting system, Ion trap system or silicon system. Each model will need a new set of control hamiltonian and a compiler that find the control pulse of a quantum gate. This part is gonna involve some physics and study of commonly used hardware platforms. The related code can be found in `qutip.qip.device` and `qutip.qip.compiler`; - Refactoring the circuit compiler to allow simple pulse scheduling, e.g. Restriction one pulses that can",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1184:1164,error,error,1164,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1184,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,". There were several issues with this function, which I have attempted to rectify as described below. Also its my first pull request (instead of asking anubhav or alex to help), so if I messed it up let me know. 1) The default method, a direct solution using sparse matrices, would fail with an ""exactly singular"" error on small examples (like the well studied single-resonant level or double quantum dot examples). The other sparse methods also suffered from the same issue, as did the 'direct' method for dense solutions. The latter, the dense matrices solver, I have fixed by capturing the error using lstsq() if np.linalg.solve() fails. For the sparse cases there seems to no equivalent fix. One can solve the issue by adding a small finite frequency to the definition of the shot noise. However, this seems like a bit of a bodge, and could cause issues if this small frequency is of the order of some system frequencies. So I have changed the default behavior to use the dense solvers, and added a description of the sparse matrix issues in the function description and in an example notebook I will upload to the example notebooks github. . Maybe someone can suggest a better fix?. 2) There was, in addition, an error in the definition of the shot noise formula in the default sparse matrix direct solution. In addition, the dense methods which used pinv() were also incorrectly defined (they were missing pre and post- multiplication by the 'Q' operator), and would thus give different results from the direct solutions. These issues have been fixed, and everything now fits expected analytical results (see example notebook). 3) I have added a frequency dependence via a list of possible frequencies at which to evaluate the shot noise. 4) I removed the option of passing a pseudo-inverse to the function directly, and changed various other interface things. I am not sure if everything conforms to PEP8 etc. Edit: the example notebook is here https://github.com/qutip/qutip-notebooks/pull/35",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/528:1352,error,error,1352,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/528,1,['error'],['error']

To see if I could track it down, I had a go with valgrind. This isn't guaranteed to find everything, because I'm not using a debug build of Python, and Python also typically optimises small allocations by using a custom allocator into some pre-allocated space it manages itself - invalid writes that still fall within this may not get detected by valgrind. Here is the output of `valgrind` running on the `kraus.py` file I wrote in the previous section: [kraus_valgrind.txt](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/files/6370180/kraus_valgrind.txt) (note I filtered out like 30,000 errors that stem from Python's internal memory management - they're nothing to worry about, they're just what happens when you have your own allocator).

Instead, I tried using `pip install qutip` which circumvented this error, but results in incorrect behavior as described below. ### Code to Reproduce the Bug. ```shell; import numpy as np; import qutip as qt. X = qt.sigmax(); print(np.linalg.eigh(X)[1]); ```. ### Code Output. ```shell; `; [[-0.70710678-0.70710678j 0.70710678+1.20710678j]; [ 0.70710678+0.70710678j 0.70710678+0.5j ]]; `; ```. ### Expected Behaviour. `; [[-0.70710678+0.j 0.70710678+0.j]; [ 0.70710678+0.j 0.70710678+0.j]]; `. ### Your Environment. ```shell; QuTiP Version: 4.7.3; Numpy Version: 1.26.2; Scipy Version: 1.11.4; Cython Version: None; Matplotlib Version: 3.8.2; Python Version: 3.12.0; Number of CPUs: 10; BLAS Info: Generic; OPENMP Installed: False; INTEL MKL Ext: False; Platform Info: Darwin (arm64); ```. ### Additional Context. I am just comparing the behavior between two environments. The first one correctly diagonalizes the Pauli X operator with a Hadamard, and the second does not. The ""correct"" environment uses a standard numpy 1.26.2 install, with qutip installed with conda. The ""incorrect"" environment uses the `accelerate` numpy install, and qutip installed with pip. Each environment has the same `qutip.about()` return string. In reality, my use case is more complex than this, but I managed to boil down the error to faulty matrix diagonlization. I also want to add that I do indeed get a factor of ~4 speedup in pure numpy examples (like those linked in the SE post), so it's only when integrating with QuTiP that something goes awry. It might be the case that there really is some compatibility issue, and using `pip` doesn't really fix anything. I'm mainly wondering whether this behavior is expected, or if there is a correct way of getting QuTiP and the `accelerate` BLAS to work together that I am missing.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2273:2220,down,down,2220,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2273,3,"['down', 'error', 'fault']","['down', 'error', 'faulty']"

As far as I can tell this XIO error is related to the xvfb module (pytest-xvfb) used to manage graphical tests without display. Some relevant discussion is found at https://github.com/The-Compiler/pytest-xvfb/issues/11 . They indicate there that this error can be triggered if windows managed by Xvfb are not properly closed before completing tests. So it's likely it's related to tests using matplotlib. The only test using matplot lib is testPlot in test_processor.py. Sure enough, if testPlot is skipped then test_processor.py passes successfully without triggering the XIO error. **To Reproduce**.

Availability,"/qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html#time-interp) it is possible to replace string time-dependent functions (e.g. for a Hamiltonian) using Cubic_Spline. This is the case if one has data describing the time-dependent object which is not easy to write analytically. In `brmesolve` the only option is to provide time-dependent functions as strings (or Cubic_Spline). This works fine for the Hamiltonian, but the `a_ops` fail a check in cy/brcodegen.py when using a Cubic_Spline type. **To Reproduce**; ```python; import qutip as qt; import numpy as np. x = np.arange(0, 10, 0.1); decay = np.exp(-x); decay_spline = qt.Cubic_Spline(x[0], x[-1], decay). sol1 = qt.brmesolve([[qt.qeye(2), ""exp(-t)""]], qt.qeye(2), [0, 1], a_ops=[[qt.qeye(2), ""exp(-w)""]]) # works fine; sol2 = qt.brmesolve([[qt.qeye(2), decay_spline]], qt.qeye(2), [0, 1], a_ops=[[qt.qeye(2), ""exp(-w)""]]) # works fine; sol3 = qt.brmesolve([[qt.qeye(2), ""exp(-t)""]], qt.qeye(2), [0, 1], a_ops=[[qt.qeye(2), decay_spline]]) # error; sol4 = qt.brmesolve([[qt.qeye(2), decay_spline]], qt.qeye(2), [0, 1], a_ops=[[qt.qeye(2), decay_spline]]) # error; ```. On the cases it gives an error (sol3, sol4), it is `Exception: Invalid a_td_term.` from br_codegen.py (`aop_td_funcs()`).; Note that the Cubic_Spline representation works perfectly fine for the Hamiltonian part (e.g. sol2). It also appears to work fine if specifying `c_ops`. **Expected behavior**; My understanding from the documentation regarding time-dependent objects is that the Cubic_Spline representation should work for brmesolve at all argument positions, where appropriate (not just the Hamiltonian and c_ops). For example, at the above URL, we have: <br/>; ""When combining interpolating functions with other Python functions or strings, the interpolating class will automatically pick the appropriate method for calling the class. That is to say that, if for example, you have other time-dependent terms that are given in the string-format, then the cubic s",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1624:1073,error,error,1073,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1624,1,['error'],['error']

Current thread 0x0000000109fe85c0 (most recent call first):; <no Python frame>; Abort trap: 6; ```. So these both use `scipy.linalg.eig`, which is suspicious. ## Valgrind checks. To see if I could track it down, I had a go with valgrind. This isn't guaranteed to find everything, because I'm not using a debug build of Python, and Python also typically optimises small allocations by using a custom allocator into some pre-allocated space it manages itself - invalid writes that still fall within this may not get detected by valgrind. Here is the output of `valgrind` running on the `kraus.py` file I wrote in the previous section: [kraus_valgrind.txt](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/files/6370180/kraus_valgrind.txt) (note I filtered out like 30,000 errors that stem from Python's internal memory management - they're nothing to worry about, they're just what happens when you have your own allocator). The important part is. ```; ==54133== Invalid write of size 8; ==54133== at 0x10AFAFA8A: ??? (in /Users/jake/.anaconda3/envs/py38/lib/libmkl_intel_thread.dylib); ==54133== by 0xFFFFFFFF: ???; ==54133== by 0x1162E4DEF: ???; ==54133== by 0x1162E3A5F: ???; ==54133== by 0x10550EB3F: ???; ==54133== by 0x3FEFFFFFFFFFFFFF: ???; ```. Obviously I don't have the debugging symbols for MKL, so it's pretty hard to say where exactly it's coming from, but it is at least clearly inside that library. I ran `valgrind` on the `Malloc.py` file above, and get the exact same invalid write, which is promising. So the most likely public Python call is `scipy.linalg.eig`. ## Minimal reproducer. Ok, so now let me cut it down to a minimum `eig.py`:. ```python; import numpy as np; import scipy.linalg. x = np.random.rand(25, 25) + 1j*np.random.rand(25, 25); scipy.linalg.eig(x); ```.

Availability,"1. inside the ""Actions"" tab at the top of the GitHub page, you will only see workflows that are present in the code in the default git branch. `dev.major` isn't QuTiP's default branch, so the workflows won't appear immediately after this is merged, only when the `.github/workflows/build.yml` file also exists in `master`. 2. nothing prevents you from running the workflow on a fork, and there's no way and no reason to prevent this - it's also how I tested it. If you did run it on a fork, you'd be using your own GitHub Actions credits (it doesn't cost us anything because we're an open-source project). Only qutip/qutip knows the secret to publish to PyPI, so no fork can succeed on that. The branch check here serves two purposes: the first is that I needed some ""tickbox"" to let the admin decide at runtime whether they needed to publish the package or just build the wheels for personal download; the second is that we release off release branches, not master, so there needed to be an input to say _which_ branch should be built. 3. it's not 100% necessary, but it's the right thing to do. It decouples the project data from the setup code, which makes it much easier to modify both, and allows other tools to access the data. There are other PEPs in the works as well that will move all this data into `pyproject.toml`, rather than just `setup.cfg`. 4. oh, that's useful. I didn't really know or look into it, because it was only a temporary thing anyway. I might actually retire this PR and make it against `master` instead.

Availability,"2dd4680 and b6dcc28 fix the occasional segfaults I was getting, I believe. The error in `reshape_csr` was probably the randomly appearing one - I assume that for it to cause a segfault, either the output CSR needed to have been allocated on the edge of allocated memory (and then I probably would have seen it in the stack trace with `faulthandler`), or it needed to be called on a sufficiently small matrix that `mem.PyMem_Malloc` allocated into Python stack memory such that the next byte after `out.row_index` pointed into freed Python memory, causing a checksum error on the next `PyMem_Malloc` that hit it, or `PyMem_Free` on a previously created object. I was able to track down where these were coming from by judicious use of `gcc -fsanitize`, although had we been using Cython's `typedmemoryview`, setting `boundscheck=True` would also have caught it. Likewise, the error in `permute.dimensions_csr` would have been caught by setting `cdivision=False`, but I just didn't think to try that. It's probably not worth swapping to memory views just because of this, though - I was able to find it easily enough with `AddressSanitizer`, and memory views have a very non-trivial overhead on initialisation for our use case.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1332#issuecomment-668847474:79,error,error,79,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1332#issuecomment-668847474,5,"['down', 'error', 'fault']","['down', 'error', 'faulthandler']"

I don't really know anything about the theory here, and just went with what the `matlab` documentation said: https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/symrcm.html. In commit 0ce36d00 it is clear that the functions in `qutip.graph` were meant to be distinct from `Qobj`, so ideally they would be beyond our purview in this package. This actually has already lead to problems with the documentation, since the docstrings in; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/01132789581821517986fad1a14ab3feec7d2de2/qutip/graph.py#L50-L53; and; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/01132789581821517986fad1a14ab3feec7d2de2/qutip/graph.py#L71-L74; are out-of-date. I find that the only uses of `qutip.graph` are in `qutip.steadystate`, which uses `reverse_cuthill_mckee` and `weighted_bipartite_matching`. The former can be replaced directly with the `scipy` version, at the cost of ~10% speed. The latter is not yet in `scipy`, so we ought to perhaps keep it, since it is used and documented for `qutip.steadystate.steadystate`. All other functions in `qutip.graph` are not used, and not documented (and in `scipy` anyway). While obviously I don't want to trample on anybody's code, I think it might be worth considering how we can reduce the package complexity of `qutip`, especially while significant new complexity is frequently being added in the interests of speed. We only have a finite amount of resources to maintain the codebase, and it's already quite difficult to get a handle on bug reports, documentation, testing (what I'm working on in #1181), and keeping old features up-to-date with the new. In the tracking down of these points, I can also strongly advocate for a stricter policy on `git` commit messages and keeping the commit history tidy and descriptive, but I'll live to fight another day on that one!",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1203:4107,down,down,4107,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1203,1,['down'],['down']

You can increase the maximum number of allowed subdivisions by increasing the `nsteps` parameter in a `qutip.Options` object, and with the `options` keyword argument. I addressed Simon's question. Also, I tried different solver options in mesolve including solver type, nsteps, relative and absolute tolerence, etc ...

Availability,"> However if `default_dtype` can be seen as _running in that mode_, it certainly could cause confusion. It's not clear how it is understood in some places.

Could it be an issue that some matrices where too big to fit in RAM forcing to use swap space? We could have a warning when matrices over a certain size are allocated. I guess this was mostly because I wasn't explicitly calling steadystate with sparse=False so it was getting converted back to CSR anyway, and slowing things down. Largely I see similar performance between CSR and dense (using sparse=False), unless I use very small systems (16x16 Liouvillians), though this seemed a bit scipy/method dependent. I guess as you said this also raises the question about whether stuff like eigenstates and steadystate() should default to using methods based on the data layer of the object, instead of kwargs? My feeling is not, since eigenstates+sparse can be bad and steadystate+largesystem+dense could be bad, so its worth having some default conversion cost in place.

With it's size, it's probably not ideal as a Dense, but I don't think we should raise an error for other type... It doesn't actually restrict the RHS to CSR -- it only *constructs* the RHS as a CSR initially. The base solver will convert the RHS to the correct format for the integrator if needed.

Be careful that the trajectory result have the final state stored. So I'm not entirely sure what you want the behaviour to be for each set of options. I think it is confusing to return a density matrix if you request store_states - the density matrix is not the same as the state of the system, and surely v5 is the perfect time to clear up issues like this.

Availability,"@hodgestar shall we attempt to sort out the caching now, or get things moved over ahead of Unitary Hack and sort it out later? I don't think it's particularly a blocking issue - the tests still all run fine, after all. There's an argument against using `pip wheel` caching for us - we've historically used our tests to try and catch errors when using new versions of packages, which we'd lose if we start pinning versions to one particular thing. I'm not sure which is more desirable for us - overall I think the time loss from installing `cvxpy` isn't _that_ high, and we'd get more improvement from redoing some of our older tests.

Availability,"@jakelishman, about the two issues you raised:. 1. Import time related to `import qutip`; I agree with you that in order to make it frictionless for downstream libraries to implement qutip's interface you'd want not to increase their loading times. That would easily be achieved by defining the `__qutip_qobj__` as the entry point of this API. A drawback of this implementation is that it requires the conversion method to be defined on the object itself.; The dispatch-like solution, as was proposed by @hodgestar, is easier to play with, can be defined in a separate file, can be added to a separate package like `netket_qutip_interop` or even using setuptools entry points, though that would add complexity. Again, I'm personally not biased. I would go with option 1 because it's simpler, but I do like the organisational beauty of option 2 (that is used throughout the jax ecosystem). 2. About implicit conversion; - Assume we can distinguish two level of APIs exposed by qutip, similar in spirit to the distinction there is between BLAS and LAPACK. ; - There are low level (BLAS-like) operations on Qobjs such as addition, kron, sum, ecc that are performed repeatedly, can be efficiently implemented only among objects whose data structure is well know. Everything is built on top of those, so they need to be fast with a low overhead. ; - There are higher-level (LAPACK-like) operations on Qobjs, such as `.eigenvalues()` or `eigenstates()`, or `sesolve/mesolve` which are built by combining several low level operations. Their runtime is much higher, and they perform a fair bit of setup/input handling, which comes at the price of some overhead, but which is negligible compared to the runtime cost for most meaningfully large systems. I'd then like to state that; - *I have never suggested to insert a mechanism to insert implicit conversion in the low-level operations.* ; - In this RFC in no way have I proposed to implement implicit conversion anywhere else then were is already done in qu",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-913661687:149,down,downstream,149,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-913661687,2,['down'],['downstream']

Availability,"A representation of a quantum circuit consiting of qubit initialisation (I), controlled NOT gates (C) and measurements (M) with respect to different bases. According to [1], the transformation of a circuit to the ICM representation provides a cannonical form for an exact and fault-tolerant, error corrected circuit needed for optimization prior to final implementation on a hardware model. The algorithm consists of magic qubit initializations, gate teleportation and conditional measurements on qubits. It can be a starting point for topological descriptions of quantum cirucuits important for fault-tolerant quantum computation and can become a part of a pipeline for optimization of topological quantum computing circuits. Check out the game (MeQuanics)[http://www.mequanics.com.au] which aims to do so using crowd sourcing. Several proposals exist for circuit optimizations once we have the topological circuit model (Machine learning, monte carlo search etc) and the ICM model can be a good starting point to get to the initial topological circuit (as far as I could understand). . The algorithm can be roughly described as follows : . ```; Require: Circuit C composed from {Toffoli,CNOT,H,P,T}; Replace the Toffoli gates with their decomposition; Replace the H gates with P V P (already implemented using `resolve_gates`); Implement P V P using gate teleportation outlined in [1]; ```. The final output is a quantum circuit only using qubit initialisations, CNOT and conditional measurements/correction. Once that is complete, maybe another addition can be a conversion to the topological model and visualizations. This is a work in progress.

Availability,"About the simulation, the frequency of your `H0` is at the level of 10^12 (with w0=0), while your control amplitude `Delta` is only 10^6! This is a huge difference. I feel like there might be an error in the unit somewhere. The number of time steps sampled needs to be hundreds of millions. Simulate this whole process is not practical. By setting `w-w0=0` you discard the fast process and what remains is only `Delta`. With `w-w0=0`, I get reasonable oscillation with the following code; ```python; def pulse(t0,t):; return np.heaviside(t-t0,2e-9). def H1_coeff(t,args):; t0=args['t0']; phi=args['phi']; return Delta*pulse(t0,t)*np.sin((w-w0)*t+phi).

If you want to observe the effect of RWA, you could set `w-w0` to be about 10 times `Delta`. That is, the frequency of your system's dynamics is about ten times larger than your driving. Discarding the system dynamics by RWA will lead to some visible error in the plot, but not significantly enough to destroy the driving dynamics. (Edited) About pulse that spikes up and dies down, a spike at one single time point is not well defined. Mathematically the integral will be 0 (in measures that makes sense here at least). If you want a pulse that is turned on for a certain duration and then off, you can use two Heaviside. But much easier: you can just shift your time scale and define your tlist `times` to be that time duration from `0` to `t_end`, which matches the duration of your pulse.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1466#issuecomment-810331229:195,error,error,195,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1466#issuecomment-810331229,3,"['down', 'error']","['down', 'error']"

Availability,"Ah, nice catch thanks, and thanks for the super clear repro. We're overhauling the solvers for QuTiP 5.0, which will include a lot more rigorous input checking on entry, but also it uses far safer low-level datatypes that would catch this shape mismatch in the C layer (even though the `dims` _should_ have been checked by `mesolve`). I'll check the other solvers and patch in a sanity test - probably after these lines: https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/d5e305513d9186df74beee4fd8da680e89f29d15/qutip/mesolve.py#L259-L261; we can just insert a test; ```python; if rho0.dims[0] != rho0.dims[1]:; raise ValueError(; ""input state must be a pure state or square density matrix""; ); ```. There may also be other segfaults lurking if you use a Python function to generate a time-dependent `Qobj` value in the Liouvillian or the expectation operators, but right now you're unlikely to use that form (because it's slow as anything). The bug slips through because we unsafely pass off a matrix down to C code (where we currently don't have sanity checks) without first verifying that it is a valid shape in Python space - the C code is working as designed, so there shouldn't be problems with correct inputs. Removing `c_ops` causes `mesolve` to delegate to `sesolve` which presumably is better at its type-checking, and I expect that a small dimension size working is likely just `malloc` having slack in the memory it gives us for small sizes or small requests being allocated into the special pre-allocated store.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1456#issuecomment-791925169:988,down,down,988,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1456#issuecomment-791925169,2,['down'],['down']

I'll have to think a little about how we'll do versioning. This bug slipped in in #1465, where the primary concern was getting wheels built, and I didn't notice that the sdist wouldn't build in release mode.; 2. `git` isn't meant to be required - in dev mode, it should just get to the string ""nogit"". That error is actually within a `try/except` block, except it only catches `subprocess.SubprocessError`, when it should catch both `subprocess.SubprocessError` and `OSError`.

Availability,"As I understand it, the only way to avoid needing to touch `MANIFEST.in` is to not have files distributed with the test suite (or to have the temporary files by `*.py`, since `setup.py` automatically recognises them). That's not really a pytest thing, it's a `setuptools` one. I don't think there's a problem distributing files as part of the tests. You can add a line which says; ```; recursive-include qutip/tests/qasm_files *.qasm; ```; to `MANIFEST.in`, and that should hopefully fix the problem. You won't have the problem locally, because you'll be running `./setup.py develop`, which ""installs"" in-place, so you don't notice the fact that you've missed files from the manifest. In the tests, it runs `./setup.py install`, which does the copy, missing files which aren't in the manifest. Boxi: I'm not certain what more you'd like to do with fixtures here. Fixtures are good for setup and tear down, parametrisation and sharing resources (like network connections), but I'm not certain what further benefit you get for a test function which is testing whether it can open a known file, read it, and construct the expected output. I think Sidhant is already doing some nice parametrisation of his tests, from what I see. Sidhant: I added a comment on the exception test, since pytest gives us an easier-to-read context manager you can use. It's also typically better practice to handle file paths like I did in that (using the overloaded `/` operator with `pathlib.Path`, or `os.path.join`) rather than manually putting in slashes. Windows _usually_ will do the right thing now with slashes, but it's better to let Python handle it for us.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1291#issuecomment-656255156:900,down,down,900,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1291#issuecomment-656255156,1,['down'],['down']
Availability,"As a note: `qutip.vector_to_operator` is part of the implementation of superoperators. The ""vector"" in the name refers to the idea that a superoperator in a Hilbert space can be represented as a vector on a different Hilbert space which comprises of two copies of the original space tensor-producted together. It doesn't refer to a ""vector"" in the sense of a ""ket"". The difference was introduced in c62a8e9, which is the amalgamated commit encompassing all the discussion in #1098. `qutip.vector_to_operator` expects to receive an argument whose `dims` parameter is of the form `[operator_dims , [1]]`, where `operator_dims` is the dimensions of a regular operator (for example `[[2], [2]]` for a single qubit Hilbert space, or `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]` for an operator acting on a Hilbert space with two qubits in. The exception occurs because `vector_to_operator` attempts to access the two elements of the `operator_dims` array to discover the output shape. Since there is an insufficient number of lists for it to access, it just ends up reading the dimensions of the first two elements of the tensor product, and `np.prod` (used to calculate the output shape) doesn't complain when passed scalars. Notice that running the code with `nb_qubits = 1` will cause an `IndexError`, as there are insufficient tensor-product elements. The immediate solution for your code is to use `qutip.ket2dm`, which converts a ket into a density matrix. I think this is what you're actually trying to do. For a fix, there are two points:; 1. The fix is simply to test that the input dimensions are of the correct form, rather than assuming; this will allow us to provide a more descriptive error.; 2. Perhaps worth considering is moving the super-operator functionality in a sub-module `qutip.super`, and not importing all the functions into the main namespace. This might help reduce user confusion going forwards, especially since most people aren't using the superoperator formalism.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1204#issuecomment-600792011:1668,error,error,1668,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1204#issuecomment-600792011,2,['error'],['error']

Availability,"Assuming Simon's point isn't just a complete answer to your question: in the general case, this is an impossible question to answer - it touches on many parts of numerical integration, such as tolerance limits and adaptive step-size methods. When you're dealing with completely arbitrary time-dependence, there's not really any one-size-fits-all approach that'll work (despite how RK45 is often taught as a magic bullet in physics courses). Here, you will likely find that your RK45 results depend strongly on how many intermediate timesteps you use, whereas QuTiP's results will be (marginally) more stable. This is because QuTiP will internally subdivide the timesteps more to achieve internal precision goals, but then only returns the results at the time points you ask for. You can increase the maximum number of allowed subdivisions by increasing the `nsteps` parameter in a `qutip.Options` object, and with the `options` keyword argument.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1733#issuecomment-986661136:193,toler,tolerance,193,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1733#issuecomment-986661136,1,['toler'],['tolerance']
Availability,"Assuming you have Anaconda 2.5 installed (so that you can use the Intel MKL on all platforms), the default number of threads is one. Therefore, you don't get much benefit. To change the number of threads used you can do:. ``` python; import mkl; mkl.set_num_threads(N); ```. or in QuTiP it is easy to set using:. ``` python; n_threads = hardware_info()['cpus']; mkl.set_num_threads(n_threads); ```. One can not access the spare MKL routines directly as there is no support in the scipy.sparse library. However, you can get to all of the functions using ctypes. An example of complex SpMV is here:. https://gist.github.com/nonhermitian/74c3ddbbd006b2f8d306. The only issue with the attached method, is that finding the MKL runtime library is platform dependent (maybe should file an issue with the Anaconda people?). Therefore, it is a bit cumbersome to work with. Moreover, it is not possible to access these routines via Cython as they do not have any of the development stuff available. That may not really be an issue at the end of the day though as one needs quite a large system to get any benefit, and at large Hilbert dimensions, the overhead from calling Python funcs. directly is not an issue. I will be chatting with the [Intel Python](https://software.intel.com/en-us/python-distribution) people tomorrow to give them some suggestions and talk about our project.

Availability,"Bumping an old topic with two major new considerations. Number one: Travis is [changing its pricing model for open source software](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing), and generally it seems like [it's going to become unfeasible for us](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/travis-cis-new-pricing-plan-threw-wrench-my-open-source-works). Over the past month or so, queue times on Linux builds have increased massively (from near-instant to up to 90 minutes), and the number of allowed concurrent builds has already limited the amount of testing we are able to do - we don't even have Windows tests because we couldn't fit them in. In around March 2021 we expect the old travis-ci.org that QuTiP is grandfathered onto to shut down completely, forcing us onto the new model on travis-ci.com. Number two: in November 2019, GitHub released their own CI, GitHub Actions. This is (as best as I can tell) completely free for open source, public repositories like QuTiP, and offers access to a large number of Linux, macOS and Windows containers. This completely free period of GitHub Actions might not last forever (you can imagine maybe they're just trying to drive adoption before increasing the cost), but especially with the new time pressure from Travis, this seems like the right choice for now. Our testing set up is fairly straightforward, so migrating to a new CI shouldn't be too difficult. I just wrote (#1429) a GitHub Actions workflow to build and distribute binary releases of QuTiP on Linux/Mac/Windows, and I'm pretty convinced by the power of their CI. It's got an awful lot of flexibility with a _lot_ of customisation so its initial learning curve is a little steep (or maybe I'm just not used to CI tools), but I'm impressed by what's available. I believe it comes with a degree of reusability as well; I think we can define a test as a single ""action"", and then reuse that in the PR-push workflow and the make-distribution workflow.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/959#issuecomment-770455542:753,down,down,753,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/959#issuecomment-770455542,4,"['avail', 'down']","['available', 'down']"
Availability,"Bumping this because I'm working on `test_metrics.py` and came across it. ## Attempting to isolate. With `cvxpy` and `cvxopt` from conda-forge, I can run all the `dnorm` tests, but as before (see #874, #880, #881) they fail too much of the time. By my rough tests, failure only occurs with any regularity when using `cvxpy` with operator inputs (not supers) of dimension 3 (not 2). I also find that using `dnorm(A, B)` with `A` and `B` drawn from `rand_unitary_haar` has a failure rate of 0.004(1), whereas drawing from `rand_unitary` instead has a failure rate about 3 times higher of 0.012(2). I'm sure if you have more (i.e. > 0) knowledge of the Haar measure than I do, that presumably gives you more information on what makes it likely for the optimisation to fail. Also, using `dnorm(A)` (i.e. taking `B` to be 0) produced no failures in 4000 tests of the same function. ## Testing strategy. Since each `dnorm` test is repeated 10 times and there's only one offending test, that's a current failure rate of about 4%. The offending test actually isn't even testing what it's supposed to test - it supposedly tests that special cases that are handled by QuTiP agree with the optimisations done by `cvxpy`, except that the offender isn't a handled special case. I'll remove that for now. I will also convert `dnorm` tests to quietly xfail if the optimisation fails, but cause a suite failure if they cause a proper `AssertionError`. ## Future. Since we have a new major version in the future, we do have the option to issue a `FutureWarning` and remove `dnorm` if we want to do so, but if so, we should get the warning out as soon as possible. It's probably worth mentioning that by-and-large, it seems like `dnorm` does actually work in most cases. > This has been the final straw. We have tried to keep dnorm supported. - @ajgpitch .

Availability,"Consider what you're doing from a statistical sense here. If everything works correctly, then you're effectively trying a two-tail hypothesis test that your test binomial distribution has a probability of 0.25, given you made `n` observations of it. The analytic success rate of your test is then; ```python; import scipy.stats; def success(n, p, tol):; dist = scipy.stats.binom(n, p); return dist.cdf(n * (p+tol)) - dist.cdf(n * (p-tol)); ```; where `success(4096, 0.25, 0.02)` is 99.67%. Since there are 5 independent runs on Travis, that's equivalent to a failure rate of 1.6% on every single CI run, which is several orders of magnitude too high. It's probably just luck that it was Python 3.8 on both occasions - it's a one-in-five chance that in two failing CI runs, it was the same setup both times. You have to consider what is most appropriate to fix the test, and what you can reasonably test in ~1 second of runtime. You don't want to increase the tolerance too much, because then you can get a lot of false positives even if something is broken. If you can bump the number of runs up to 100,000 and set the tolerance at 0.01, you'll have a per-test failure rate of ~3e-13, which is more like what we'd want.

Availability,"Currently QuTiP solvers are pure batch jobs. One calls a function, e.g. `mesolve`, which then runs until the state has been propagated to all requested time steps and then the function returns the result. There are a variety of use cases where having access to results as they are calculated can be useful:. * Implementing a progress bar; * Limiting how long a solver runs for; * Stopping a solver early if a steady state or other desired or undesired state is detected.; * Implementing adaptive solvers where parameters are changed depending on the current state. We're currently refactoring the QuTiP solvers for QuTiP v5, so perhaps now is a good time to consider whether this feature will see enough use to be worth the effort. Implementation options:. * The solver could call a `callback function` each time a new result becomes available.; * The solver could `yield` each time a new result becomes available.; * The solver could do something asynchronous (I think this is not worth supporting natively in QuTiP -- either of the others would allow something asynchronous to be implemented by a QuTiP users themselves if they wanted). Probably these are not mutually exclusive. To make porting easier, it should still be possible to call some solve function without a callback or yielding as one can do now.

If expectation values for a lot of different operators are requested it becomes a bit tedious to keep track of which order the operators appear in e_ops, and which index show be used in result.expect. A solution could be to make all evolution solvers support that e_ops is given as a dictionary, for example:. ```; e_ops = {'a' : destroy(N), 'N': num(N), 'X': destroy(N) + create(N)}; ```.

I can't reproduce the error unless `pyximport.install()` has already been run before QuTiP is imported (e.g. if I do `import pyximport; pyximport.install(); import qutip` or `importlib.reload(qutip)`). We have `qutip/__init__.py` organised so that we don't enable `pyximport` until after we've done the test for `qutip.cy.openmp.parfuncs`: first we do. https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/8e181cc44ceefc14ad0e4f4bcf78e1c8fcd2b291/qutip/__init__.py#L100-L105. and only after that do we. https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/8e181cc44ceefc14ad0e4f4bcf78e1c8fcd2b291/qutip/__init__.py#L124-L126. In your error it's trying to build `qutip.cy.openmp.parfuncs`, and the only line that ever attempts to import that (in Python space) is line 101 above in `__init__`. It can only attempt to Cythonize files if `pyximport` is activated, but `qutip` doesn't activate that til a few lines later. It's certainly still a bug that this error appears if you've manually activated `pyximport` before (which would definitely cause it), but I'm struggling to find any other reason that the error could appear. We're looking to simplify the handling of OpenMP in a later version, and this buggy check is certainly a good reason to expedite that.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1334#issuecomment-670167290:207,error,error,207,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1334#issuecomment-670167290,8,['error'],['error']

Availability,"First of all I'm glad you could get it to run under OSX. Which OpenCL environment are you using?; - Is the failure of `test_mcsolve_cl_time_dep_h` reproducible?; - You can probably ignore the compiler warning. I assume it is related to the pragma statement. Some OpenCL implementations refuse to work without it, others give you a warning that it is unnecessary. Maybe we can omit the statement based on the platform version and hide some warning, but that would require more testing (on different platforms). At the moment there is a lot of debug information to ease testing.; - The AttributeError you get is something I have not encountered yet. If you do consider merging this branch, it is a good idea to get more people involved in testing. The code has not been reviewed and probably contains some bugs. The questions you raised concerning the maintainability are all valid. On top of that setting up OpenCL is somewhat troublesome, which makes `mcsolve_cl` a kind of experimental feature. Ultimately it is up to the maintainers of qutip to decide whether such a feature should be included. The advantage `mcsolve_cl` has over `mcsolve_f90` is that it supports some time-dependence and introduces no build dependencies. If, for some reason `mcsolve_cl` does not work, the user can always fall back to `mcsolve`. By the way, is it wise to rebase this branch all the time or only when necessary?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/554#issuecomment-260134503:107,failure,failure,107,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/554#issuecomment-260134503,1,['failure'],['failure']

Availability,"For a constant Liouvillian, it seems very reasonable that an eigenseries-based solution would be faster? In the end, that massively reduces the number of matrix-matrix operations to be done. I'm not at all familiar with Matlab, but I wouldn't be shocked if that's what your toolbox there is doing too. Looking at your code, you seem to have 16 cores available. QuTiP at present can't make too much use of multiple cores in `mesolve` or `essolve` (though it can in `correlation`), whereas Matlab may well have some fancy parallelised methods for solving eigenvector problems (if doing that method) - we rely on Scipy for our eigenvector calculations, and I'm pretty sure there's no parallelisation in there. There could also be large timing disparities if you're not being linked to good BLAS/LAPACK/ARPACK implementations in Python space. I'm sure that any distributed version of Matlab will come stuffed with lovely libraries compiled specifically for your processor's instruction set, but Scipy may only be able to find Netlib BLAS or (even worse) Accelerate - if so, they probably won't be making good use of vectorised instructions in your processor, and may not be well-optimised for memory access.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1591#issuecomment-871031472:350,avail,available,350,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1591#issuecomment-871031472,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"For clarity: I ran your code with 1,000 timesteps and 10,000 timesteps and found a linalg norm difference in the outputs of 4.4e-4 (compared to QuTiP's 6.5e-8), which is what I meant. I considered that difference ""not fully convergent"" in part because QuTiP's default tolerance goals have an absolute tolerance of ~1e-8 (that's per-element, not the full norm). Here's a couple more things to look at:; - if you're using QuTiP objects without our solvers like this, we tidy up sparse matrices at every operation. You probably don't want that - you might get different results if you convert your RK method to work on raw Numpy arrays.; - your RHS isn't accurate - it takes `sqrt(gamma)`, but your time-dependent function already does that. This is perhaps a mistake, and very likely the source of the discrepancy? Also, while it's irrelevant here, your Lindbladian has `c_op * c_op.dag() * rho` as the last term, but it should be `c_op.dag() * c_op * rho`.; - your RK method isn't using updated versions of the Hamiltonian or the collapse operator at the intermediate timesteps.; - you say you're using RK45, but you've only got 4 different evaluations?

Availability,"For large matrices (`dim > ~500`), the dense matrix dot product is still a pretty large cost, but you're still saving a fair amount. That said, at that kind of dimension, the analytical formula may do you well enough. If you want derivatives wrt alpha, you should be able to get analytic ones from my method - there's no ""black box"" numerical work that goes on in `__call__`, everything is just matrix multiplication. Given that it appears non-linearly in a possibly large multiplication, though, and I would imagine the derivatives are pretty smooth, you may well just be faster just numerically approximating it with finite differences (I don't know anything about autodifferentiation). If you're so inclined, you can sacrifice some speed for higher accuracy in the eigenvector calculations, as we can find the eigenvalues semi-analytically. There are a few places in numpy and scipy that can find the roots of the Hermite polynomials for you (i.e. get the eigenvalues), which will be found exactly wrt double precision (I believe). You can then call out to the LAPACK routine `dstein` to get the eigenvectors from the eigenvalues. `dstein` is slower than `dstemr`/`dsteqr` (which is what scipy uses, I think), but it allows us to supply the eigenvalues, removing some numerical error.

Availability,"For point 2: adding marks right now will cause conflicts, but if #1181 gets merged then it'll be much simpler. The main issue is that a lot of the testing structure has changed for tests up to `test_mcsolve.py` alphabetically, and so in general the tests are just not the same. The principle is pretty straightforwards - just like #1181 introduces a `requires_cython` mark, we would add `uses_cython`, `uses_mkl` and `uses_openmp` marks. These would be even simpler to add than `requires_cython` because unlike it, they don't require any test-generation logic at all. The change would simply be to add them to `pytest.ini`, mark the requisite functions and then change the pytest invocation of the specialised test to `pytest -m ""uses_cython""` or whatever. As far as I'm aware, the only parts of their codebase which modify their behaviour based on whether `Cython` is available is `QobjEvo`. The other parts (like `brmesolve`) just don't work if Cython isn't there. The MKL tests would become very short; by my reckoning, MKL is only used by `steadystate` and `countstat`. OpenMP is much more pervasive, as `sesolve`, `mesolve` and `brmesolve` all use it, and parts which depend on those are generally the slowest tests. The short tests could just become `pytest -m ""not slow""`? That's not super speedy, but it takes about half the time, maybe. If you want more, then a good starting point is `pytest --durations=0` which will tell us which tests are the slowest (perhaps that was what you already did when marking the slow ones?).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1217#issuecomment-604011776:869,avail,available,869,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1217#issuecomment-604011776,2,['avail'],['available']

This can be seen as equation 251 from [Gri98] differs from equation 52 from [PRA44]. There might be another issue with a `k` factor instead of a `-k` factor, but it should not matter as long as thermal population is 0. For some unknown reason, using `A` or its transpose does not change anything on qubits systems.; * Second, `c_ops` should not be dissipation operators but operators coupling to the environment bath.

Availability,"He did - he's the original feature requester, but given super super weird interactions with ufuncs (see #1433), it's not so clear to me that it was _necessarily_ the right idea to implement especially now it's causing problems with how numpy arrays are used in the library. There always was a work-around; allowing `np.array(qobj)` was more to save him from writing `x = x.full() if isinstance(x, Qobj) else np.asarray(x)`. That said, I came round to the idea more as I read more about the control we can have over the rest of the numpy infrastructure. We can allow `np.array` on `Qobj` (satisfying Michael's original request), and with a little bit of extra code we can prevent all the super weird ufunc/implicit casting behaviour, because `Qobj` shouldn't be able to implicitly interoperate with raw arrays. I know in my personal code I'd rather use `Qobj.full()`, but I no longer think it's _wrong_ to allow `np.array(qobj)` given that other people like it, even with these numpy 1.20 problems. It does make it difficult to put `Qobj` in arrays, but numpy 1.20 has ruled out being able to have `np.array(qobj)` and `np.array([qobj1, qobj2], dtype=object)`, so that's not really our fault.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1434#issuecomment-772665656:1185,fault,fault,1185,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1434#issuecomment-772665656,2,['fault'],['fault']

Availability,"Hello Eric, thank you for the quick response!. We have spoken with some members of the qutip team during the grant meetings regarding porting it directly into qutip, and we agreed it would be a good addition as a separate solver. There are a couple of we-believe-good reasons to provide <code>krylovsolve</code> as another qutip solver. As you mention, the method is currently limited to constant closed system Hamiltonians. Another possible addition discussed during the meetings was support for open quantum systems, which provides another unitary-fund grant opportunity for some students!. Another important application for many-body systems comes in handy with Krylov. Given the memory limitations from matrix representation of operators and the exponential growth of many-body systems Hilbert spaces, the limit of qubits on which the solvers live is around 15 qubits. This limitation gets expanded (in exchange for some slow down in the computations) to a few more qubits exploiting the binary operational nature of many-body systems. While any solver could use operations instead of matrices, it is a good testing bead to use Krylov's algorithm because of a property when constructing this space. This feature is a must-have within our research group, and everyone could also benefit from it. More importantly, Krylov is gaining increasing interest in the research community, and we believe that providing it as a qutip solver will increase the traffic of the repository. Regarding benchmarks and some documentation, we have a public jupyter notebook with some benchmarks here [krylov use examples](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f7ng8q9QNEzaZ97vGop3aIip8GPtl3GR?usp=sharing), and there's also a [medium blog post](https://medium.com/@julian.ruffinelli/krylov-approximation-method-for-quantum-evolution-148b3f023ec4) with some other details.

Availability,"Hello! This is the first of hopefully a few PRs to add measurement functions to qutip. This PR adds a new module named `qutip.measurement` that contains two functions:. * `measure(op, state)` that performs a classic quantum measurement as described in most introductory texts (measurement collapses a state to an eigenvector of an hermitian operator and the result is the corresponding eigenvalue). It is intended to simulate a simple measurement that could be performed in a real experiment. * `measurement_statistics(op, state)` returns information that is not available via a real experiment, but is nevertheless often useful in simulator (the eigenvalues and vectors or projection operators for the measurement operator and the probabilities of each measurement result). Both functions support either kets or density matrices and return sensible results based on the kind of input. Not currently supported:. * Partial measurements of a system.; * Destructive measurements (aka von Neumann measurements of the second kind); * Density matrix ensembles (applying the measurement probabilities to the density matrix rather than making a specific measurement); * Any custom support for qubit measurement (my plan is to add those to a `qutip.qip.measurements` module once we have the basics of this module agreed on). Questions / things I'd like feedback on:. * Do the inputs and outputs of the current functions seem intuitive / sensible?; * What are the most important other features to support?; * I don't want to have too many functions, but I also don't necessarily want to cram all possible kinds of measurements into one function.

Availability,"Hello. As qutip is new to me, I'am not shure if there is a real problem or if it is just poor understanding. Well, here is my issue:; I'd like to get the the final state after solving some unitary time evolution with `mesolve`. The input state is a tensor product of three Fock states.; `psi0 = tensor(basis(N+1,0), basis(N+1,0), basis(N+1,N))`. Then I do the evolution like this:; `H = tensor(a, b, c.dag() * c.dag()) - tensor(a.dag(), b.dag(), c * c)`; Operators a,b and c are defined as `destroy(N+1)`.; `times = np.linspace(0.0, 2.0, 100.0)`; `opts = Options(store_states=False, store_final_state=True)`; `result = mesolve(H, psi0, times, [], [numAop,numBop,numCop], options=opts)`. Now I observe different dimension of input and output state:; `print(psi0.dims, psi0.shape)`; `print(result.final_state.dims, result.final_state.shape)`; gives:; [[41, 41, 41], [1, 1, 1]] [68921, 1]; [[68921], [1]] [68921, 1]; So somehow the dimension structure is lost.

Availability,"Hello. I am currently running a simulation with `mesolve` (yet the same error occurs with `sesolve`) with a slow perturbation, such that close to zero the Hamiltonian is very close to zero (the perturbation is a thin Gaussian distribution). When I run `mesolve`, instead of running my time-dependent coefficients for the values in `tlist` (where in this case I had 250 times in `tlist`), **QuTiP** uses about 20 seemingly random time values, some of which are not even in `tlist`. . I believe this error is stemming from the Hamiltonian changing extremely slowly and being close to zero for a long period of time. This is because **QuTiP** began working normally when I added the constant 0.00001 to my time-dependent coefficient. Is there a bug here, or is there something I am missing about small-frame limits of the software?. An example piece of code that reproduces this error is below.; ```python; import numpy as np; import qutip as qt. def StandardGaussianPi(t):; def gauss_distr(x, sigma, mu):; return np.exp(-((x - mu)/sigma)**2 / 2) / (sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)); return np.pi * gauss_distr(t, 2, 20). def run_experiment(waveform, tlist, a):; def coeff_1(t, args):; print(t); return -1/2 * waveform(t) * -1; coeff_2 = lambda t, args: coeff_1(t, args) * np.sqrt(2) * np.cos(a * t); coeff_3 = lambda t, args: coeff_1(t, args) * np.sqrt(2) * np.sin(a * t); hamiltonian = [[gm(1), coeff_1], [gm(6), coeff_2], [gm(7), coeff_3]]; initial_state = qt.basis(3, 0); e_ops = [gm(1), gm(2), gm(3)]; return qt.mesolve(hamiltonian, initial_state, tlist, None, e_ops).expect. run_experiment(StandardGaussianPi, np.linspace(0, 40, 250), -0.2); ```; The function `gm` was used to generate matrices.

Availability,"Hi @VolodyaCO, thanks for reporting this!; I think the reason for `tlist` being overridden is because the result will be independent of `tlist` when the input is a steady-state. This can be seen in the following equations:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57414022/121327018-5d313680-c913-11eb-9760-ca6004daca18.png); where rho is the initial state (`state0`) and H is the Hamiltonian of the system. I use the fact that rho is a steady-state to remove its temporal dependence. This derivation is simplified assuming unitary evolution (no collapse operators) but the same applies in the most general case where we include the collapse operators. This is my guess on why `tlist=[0]` is employed when using `state0=None`: the result does not depend on `tlist`. Hence, this is probably not a bug as the result should be mathematically correct. That being said, I would also expect the same output shape for the cases shown above unless explicitly mentioned in the docstring of the function. Thus, I think the way to go here is to document this behaviour in the docstring (as well as removing the t appearing in correlation_..._1t docstring) as any change in the output shape will break backwards compatibility. However, it may be worth considering whether this is the intended behaviour for QuTiP 5. I would suggest removing `state0=None` as possible input for simplicity in the maintenance and testing or at least I would make the example shown by @VolodyaCO to be consistent and have the same output.

Availability,"Hi @nathanshammah,. Could this issue perhaps be broken into sub-tasks in some way, perhaps, in order to enable work starting on it a bit more feasible?. Also, I can see it's been labelled as a ""good first issue"" but it seems to me the definition of done (i.e., what would a PR - or a set of PRs - that would successfully address the problem entail?), with respect to the entire issue, could be clarified a bit further, and the breakdown into sub-tasks (which itself might result organically from some further discussion) might help a bit in that direction. Regarding possible approaches for handling randomness - I have to admit I've started looking into QuTiP only very recently, and I'm yet to start familiarising myself with its more intricate details and get to run the full set of tests, and investigate what kind of test failures occur. In the meantime, I'll generally share some (what I _think_ is) relevant experience in the context of handling randomness in tests:; - My understanding is that we're talking about not testing the behaviour of random-number generations per se, but how the numbers they generate affect the non-deterministic functions/algorithms, which depend on the former. In such cases, I've either used a fixed seed (as you've mentioned in your [original post](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issue-619006856)), which can get a bit messy, as there's Python's `random`, NumPy's `random` (which also comes in a legacy and a modern flavour, namely `numpy.random.RandomState` and `numpy.random.Generator`). Also, as you've mentioned, there's tight coupling between the implementation logic and the corresponding set of tests, and updates in the former require constant maintenance of the latter.; - As an alternative, I've sometimes resorted to [`mock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html)ing the random-number generation process itself, and - in a way equivalent to using a fixed seed - providing a pre-defined sequence of numbers to the functions ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-1123679707:827,failure,failures,827,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-1123679707,2,['failure'],['failures']
Availability,"Hi @nonhermitian, I spent some time struggling with this as I recently shifted to macOS. This problem affects other Python installations too. I found a solution to this and if you could update it in the docs instead of the default macOS installation script, then it would be very helpful for new users. I will post the solution first and explain it below. . 1. Install a manual Python version which overrides the default Python supplied by Apple in the `usr/bin/python` path. You can check this using ```which python```. Installing using brew - . ```brew install python```. 2. Change the default Python interpreter from the one supplied by macOS in `usr/bin/python` to the user installed version in `/usr/local/bin/python`. This is explained in this [post](http://blog.manbolo.com/2014/09/27/use-python-effectively-on-os-x#p1). Edit the file `/etc/paths` using ```sudo vi etc/paths``` and move the line `/usr/local/bin` to the top. This makes the user installed Python default and the packages installed by pip or brew are imported instead of the ones supplied by apple. Restart the terminal. You may need to update numpy and scipy using ```pip install numpy``` or ```pip install numpy -U```. 3. Install qutip using ```python setup.py install```. Apple has its own Python version and a few modules such as numpy and scipy come along with it which are at `/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.11/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7`. These modules are difficult to manage and update due to issues with permission. Hence, even if you update numpy or scipy using `pip` or `brew`, it is not detected by Python. ~~This also raises an issue later `error: could not create 'build/src.macosx-10.12-x86_64-2.7': Permission denied`~~. This solution seems better since it does not mess with the system default. Edit 1 : sudo -H is needed to install using ```sudo -H python setup.py install```. The -H tag sets the home directory as the default for installing configuration files.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/348#issuecomment-263745214:1657,error,error,1657,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/348#issuecomment-263745214,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"Hi @pschindler, thanks for reporting this! Although the eigenenstates are different for both cases (`sparse=True` and `sparse=False`) I believe that they are both equally valid since the operator has degenerated eigenvalues. The approach for the computation of the eigenstates for both `sparse=True ` and `sparse=False` is different so that may explain why you see different results. For the case that @Ericgig presented though, the eigenvalues are non-degenerated. I tracked down the issue and it is related to how we compute these eigenvalues. When we ask for all the eigenvalues what we actually do is to compute the smallest half in with one method (`scipy.sparse.linalg(which='LR')`) and the largest half with a different method (`scipy.sparse.linalg(which='SR')`). Smallest half and largest half here means relative to the _real_ part of the eigenvalue. This makes complete sense for the cases where the eigenvalues are real but unfortunately not so much sense when we only care about the imaginary part. This is what the `which` is doing, is selecting the values with smallest/largest real part. If we include a small real component the bug completely disappears:; ```; In [56]: (qutip.num(4)*(1j+0.00001)).eigenenergies(sparse=True); Out[56]:; array([1.23048985e-16-2.21177095e-16j, 1.00000000e-05+1.00000000e+00j,; 2.00000000e-05+2.00000000e+00j, 3.00000000e-05+3.00000000e+00j]); ```; Because now there is a real part to use in the ordering. The behavior of `eigenstates` is definitely wrong and one way of solving it would be to not use both `LR` and `SR` options when all the eigenvalues are required and instead chose internally just one. This would still return results ordered by their real part but at least all the eigenvalues would be present (only once). We may want to extend the behavior of `eigenstates` to not only accept `sort=low` and `sort=high` and instead have a similar behavior to the one provided by scipy and allow sorting by imaginary part or absolute value.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1998#issuecomment-1416862009:476,down,down,476,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1998#issuecomment-1416862009,1,['down'],['down']
Availability,"Hi @pschindler,. Indeed, the behavior you show is a bug in qutip 4.7.0. Thanks for reporting this! However, it is actually a bug in the `sparse=True` case. The scipy case gives a different result compared to qutip sparse because of the method used. `eigh` assumes the input is hermitian but `op` is not. You can see the correct eigenvalues using:; ```; In [7]: scipy.linalg.eigvals(op.full()); Out[7]:; array([-1. -2.22044605e-16j, -0.5+8.66025404e-01j, -0.5-8.66025404e-01j,; 0.5+8.66025404e-01j, 0.5-8.66025404e-01j, 1. +0.00000000e+00j]); ```. I am genuinely surprised that the `sparse=False` is bugged in the latest version of qutip. Fortunately, I tested this in the master branch of qutip (this contains the qutip 5.0.0 alpha version) and the bug seems to be solved there. This operator is indeed subjected to the same bug Eric shows (it is non-hermitian). However, due to the real part of the eigenvalues, it actually shows the correct answer (similar to the example I showed in my previous comment). I will try to find the source of the error but it seems very likely that we incorrectly label the operator as hermitian and hence uses the wrong method to find eigenvalues.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1998#issuecomment-1419816348:1045,error,error,1045,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1998#issuecomment-1419816348,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"Hi Chester,. I'm not that familiar with matplotlib on Windows, but I'm guessing that; something has gone wrong with the event loop being used to render the; matplotlib figures (possibly QuTiP did something wrong or maybe something; else happened). Could you confirm that you're using the TkAgg matplotlib backend? You can; check with matplot.get_backend(). And are you using IPython or the ordinary; Python console?. Usually only:. b = qutip.Bloch(); b.show(). is required to display the plot. Behind the scenes .show() and; .make_sphere() both call .render(...). I suspect that the empty axes you; are seeing might be related to having rendered the sphere a few different; times. Could you start a new Python console and try:. import qutip; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; b = qutip.Bloch(); b.render(); plt.show(). I'm hoping that will give you just the plot you are looking for (and so; give you a work around for now). The reason this might be slightly more; robust is that internally b.show() renders the sphere onto the existing; axes, which could possibly be related to the issue you are seeing. After; closing the plot window, running b.render() and plt.show() should display; the sphere again. If that fails, could you confirm that you can show any plots with; matplotlib?. You could also try updating to a more recent matplotlib, but let's perhaps; leave that as a last resort.

Availability,"Hi Louis,. There is work in development that will allow `QobjEvo` to be build from callback also, not just list. This will make callback work anywhere easily. . I was in the impression that H callback worked already for mcsolve. I rewrote part of mcsolve and broke it. Looking at your commit, I inverted `_funcrhs_with_state` and `_funcrhs`...; Sorry to have you take time to correct it. The 20x is big, but the list format allows for optimizations that are hard to do with a callback. A big one is that you don't need to create a new matrix/Qobj when calling `mul_vec`, just use it. With this code, I see a 20x between `mul_vec` and creating a Qobj a python function. . ```; import numpy as np; import qutip as qt. qoe = qt.QobjEvo([qt.qeye(3),[qt.destroy(3), lambda t,_:np.sin(t)]]); qoe.compile(). o1 = qt.qeye(3); o2 = qt.destroy(3) ; def H(t):; return o1 + o2 * np.sin(t). v = np.ones(3)+0j; %timeit qoe(0); %timeit qoe.mul_vec(0, v); %timeit H(0); %timeit H(0).data * v; ```. One optimization you could do is having the callback return a `np.array` instead of a Qobj. In `mcsolve`, this would probably be simple to implement and I expect some speed gain. But it can't really be officially supported in Qutip, for now. . ps. All those 'redundant' argument setting are for reusing the system (`ss`) in multiple call of `mcsolve` with different args, used in `correlation`. Using string coefficient, the compilation step can take a few second, so it is set to be able to reuse a compiled system, changing the `psi0`, `args`, `e_ops`, etc. This will become a less obscure feature in v5 when solver object are available.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1260#issuecomment-629231634:1241,redundant,redundant,1241,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1260#issuecomment-629231634,4,"['avail', 'redundant']","['available', 'redundant']"
Availability,"Hi Nathan,. I can't modify the Wiki page because I'm not a maintainer of QuTiP. And it seems that there is no way to make a PR to Wiki. I can also send you the markdown source code per email like this, but I’m not sure if it works as I expected. The following is the markdown source code:. -----------------------------------; ## 1. Error mitigation in QuTiP; From the QuTiP 4.5 release, the qutip.qip module now contains the noisy quantum circuit simulator (which was a GSoC project) providing enhanced features for a pulse-level description of quantum circuits and noise models. A new class `Processor` and several subclasses are added to represent different platforms for quantum computing. They can transfer a quantum circuit into the corresponding control sequence and simulate the dynamics with QuTiP solvers. Different noise models can be added to `qutip.qip.noise` to simulate noise in a quantum device. This module is still young and many features can be improved, including new device models, new noise models and integration with the existing general framework for quantum circuits (`qutip.qip.circuit`). There are also possible applications such as error mitigation techniques [1-3]. The tutorial notebooks can be found at http://qutip.org/tutorials.html#nisq. A recent presentation on the FOSDEM conference may help you get an overview (https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/quantum_qutip/). See also the Github Project page for a collection of related issues and ongoing Pull Requests. ### Expected outcomes; - More devices defined in the `qutip.qip.device` module. At the moment, we have two models: spin chain and cavity QED. We would like to include some other commonly used planform such as Superconducting system, Ion trap system or silicon system. Each model will need a new set of control hamiltonian and a compiler that find the control pulse of a quantum gate.

Availability,"Hi QuTiP users,. I am not quite sure how I should introduce the issue that I have, but basically it comes down to the fact that my Hamiltonian and a particular function seems to require >500 GB of RAM for some parameters used. For the desired parameters, this can even become Terabytes which is hard to implement. . The main parameters by the way is N, which is the dimension of the Hilbert Space. The maximum is N=111 when running the program on the 500 GB node. The memory usage fits very good to a RAM (MB) = 0.0008804*N^4 dependence. A strange thing is that Slurm's MaxRSS command says that only 133,690 MB was needed to run the program, which is not close to the 500 GB. The memory profiler said that one function required 145,766.2 MiB (152,846.9 MB) at some point, and 327,769.4 MiB (343,691.1 MB) was freed. Together this comes close to the 500 GB, although I don't understand the numbers. I have no profound knowledge of the memory allocation in Python and QuTiP, but I would like to check if this can be improved. I went to two IT consultants who are in charge of the National Supercomputer in the Netherlands, and they also found no errors in my code. One of their suggestions was to ask you for advice on this topic.

Availability,"Hi Subimal,. This happens because of the truncation of the Fock space. You can see a related discussion here ; https://groups.google.com/g/qutip/c/DD6z8kYUU1I/m/k48XZS1AAgAJ. But in short, with truncation there is always an error in the commutators, so for truncating the Fock states at N photons, I think you find that [a,a.dag()] = \sum_{n=0}^(N-1) |n><n| - N|N><N| (you can check this by writing out these operators as projectors onto fock states, you will notice a*a.dag() is missing a term due to the truncation that should cancel with a term in a.dag()*a). Similarly putting the creation and annihilation operators into the position/momentum definition of the Hamiltonian, you find H = sum_{n=0}^(N-1)(n+0.5) |n><n| + N/2 |N><N|. Hence, since you truncated at 9 photons in your example, there is a degeneracy of the 4.5 eigenvalue. I am not sure if there is much can be done about this in general, perhaps the discussion I linked above might be useful. The main message I suppose is always take a larger cut-off than you think you might need, particularly if you are relying on the commutation relations to simplify things for you (which, given your example, can be a bad idea some times!). . I guess there is an interesting question about what is the best practice in these things, e.g., if you have a non-linear model, what form is it best to put it in before moving to a truncated basis? given your example, I would expect something like normal ordering to be better.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1587#issuecomment-869408770:224,error,error,224,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1587#issuecomment-869408770,2,['error'],['error']

For example in the Monte Carlo solver, the `map` option decides which of these functions is used, allowing users to switch easily between serial and parallel execution. These functions also come with error handling already, and they select a default number of processes based on the CPU count.

Availability,"Hi paul,. Thanks for the feedback. I think maybe Rob had originally included the mkl stuff, but I took it out when I was bug fixing. Will put it in, I didn't realize it gave such a big performance boost. thats cool. I will also follow your advice and stick in a finite frequency to make sure all the solvers work. . I had a poke around in discussion forums for numpy and scipy, and it seems like the problem is that they throw an exception when they decide L is ""exactly singular"" (which technically it is). Sometimes numerical rounding errors prevent this exception, as occurs in larger systems, or adding a finite frequency, so it tries to solve it anyway and succeeds, because the projector Q on the right-hand side guarantees a solution. Conversely, matlab will just throw a warning, and try and solve it anyway.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/528#issuecomment-243988381:537,error,errors,537,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/528#issuecomment-243988381,2,['error'],['errors']

Availability,"Hi, this is just a refactoring of @nwlambert 's code for a generic HEOM solver which takes in a set of exponents and coefficients for a spectral density function and can be used to work with arbitrary spectral density functions. In comparison, the current `heom` solver in QuTiP is specialized. . Specific quantum systems in the `qutip/models` sub-module could have the following signature:; ```; model = System(hamiltonian, **params); result = model.solve(initial_state, tlist, options); ```; System specific functions could be in the model class. For instance,; ```; model._rhs(); ```; gives the RHS (a matrix equivalent to an effective Liouvillian) of the density matrix evolution equation. If any system can be written down as the evolution of an initial density matrix as dp/dt = (RHS)p, and there is an optimised way to solve, it can be written down as a qutip.model. The other necessary function would be a basis change map or a lookup dictionary for translating a state tuple to the index in the larger density matrix which is used for the evolution using the effective Liouvillian. This is the `_heom_state_dictionaries` in this case and `jmm1_dictionary` in case of the WIP #753 . The code in the current form is good enough to be used but it needs to be optimized further. The next steps are:; - [x] Tests for RHS generation and the solve function; - [ ] Optimize the generation of the effective Liouvillian (RHS) similar to the `heom` solver; - [ ] Refactoring and deciding on the API (how to pass in the coefficients etc)",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/793:723,down,down,723,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/793,2,['down'],['down']

Availability,"Hi,. Thanks for digging into this! Given the docstring of `qutip.propagator`, this behavior was unexpected for me https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/propagator.py#L62-L76. Changing the propagator to consider a list with a single element as a single float value (`[t]` would be the same as `t`) would break the current API and could eventually break some scripts built using QuTiP and using the fact that `qutip.propagator` of `[t]` gives identity. The best way to fix this would probably be to edit the docstring to emphasize the expected behavior for a single `t` value and for a list of times. P.S.: Not directly related to this issue but when looking for QuTiP doc on search engines, it often sends to documentation for old versions of QuTiP. Typically http://qutip.org/docs/4.0.2/apidoc/functions.html#module-qutip.propagator. What about putting a banner on these legacy documentations online stating that ""You are reading the documentation of an older version of QuTiP.

Availability,"Hi,. There is a [manual integration](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/floquet.py#L602-L624) using rectangles method in `qutip.floquet` file which sometimes fail. Problem is that the number of timesteps, `nT`, is hardcoded and not accessible to the user. In my case, `nT = 100` does not seem to be enough and the integral is wrong. A quick and dirty fix is to have an extra `nT=100` keyword argument to `floquet_master_equation_rates`, so that user can overload it. Still, it does not seem to be the most efficient way of doing it. I have a quick fix I can contribute which is using `scipy.integrate.simps` instead. This requires keeping an array of values to integrate in memory (which is less memory-efficient) but I could keep `nT=100` and get the correct integral by using this method. I guess the best option would be to use [`scipy.integrate.quad`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.quad.html#scipy.integrate.quad), as it uses an adaptive algorithm.

Availability,"Hi,; I'm trying to use `mesolve` using a sampled hamiltonian to be interpolated (_list array format_ according to [the doc](https://qutip.org/docs/latest/apidoc/functions.html?highlight=mesolve#module-qutip.mesolve)) with a `tlist` that isn't the time list `times` of the Hamiltonian coefficients, but a sublist `eval_times` of `times`.

Availability,"I agree with this, with some additional points:; 1. `QobjEvo` also needs to be handled by `__matmul__`, but this should be handled by returning `NotImplemented`, and letting `QobjEvo.__rmul__` dispatch it to `QobjEvo.__rmatmul__`.; 1. however we choose to do this, `__mul__` should return `NotImplemented` if the other element can't be handled correctly; it shouldn't raise an exception by itself. The ""Pythonic"" way is to try/catch an exception in handling, but this just means we need to be sure that all `__mul__` methods do proper error checking, and _do_ reject invalid input rather than just silently doing weird stuff.; 1. what do we want to do in response to being multiplied with Numpy arrays? We have to be careful, because otherwise we might do very different things depending on whether we're being multiplied from the left or right by the Numpy array, which isn't really desirable. My first instinct is to say we should make ourselves appear as a scalar type to Numpy, so it broadcasts the multiplication over the scalar values in its array. To do that, we may need to play a little with `__array__`, `__array_ufunc__` and `__array_function__`, and return `NotImplemented` from `Qobj.__mul__(array)`. I think this maybe gives the most useful behaviour? I can't imagine a situation where it would make sense for a data-layer type to accept a Numpy array in a scalar-multiplication routine, and doing things this way allows people to use the broadcasting support of Numpy for convient looping. Just for posterity, I'm really strongly against any automatic promotion to `Qobj`, with the exception of handling scalar numbers in `__add__` and `__sub__`, where mathematical convention is that they mean the relevant identity operator scaled by the scalar. Having that is also necessary to have `sum()` work with `Qobj` ergonomically.

Availability,"I completely agree with you that random tests really aren't the right way to go in general, but right now our problem is that basically QuTiP's entire testing suite is based on randomised tests, and that's an awful lot of technical debt to overcome any time soon :(. . The `dnorm` tests have historically been a huge problem, even though basically nobody's worked on `dnorm` for a long long time now (for context, see in particular #880 and #874). We don't actually even know if the failures in `dnorm` are deterministic and reproducible, although it turns out that I had a brief look into this when I joined as a GSoC student about a year ago... I don't remember doing it at all!. I know this is super inelegant and not the perfect method, but it's kind of a nasty trade-off - I don't have time to really dig into `dnorm` (a topic I know almost nothing about) to work out an appropriate solution to temperamental errors, we do want `dnorm` to be tested since we're shipping it, and the slight flakiness keeps causing us test suite failures about 1 in 10 times. I'm somewhat opposed to fixing the random seed because having the variance over several test runs does actually help us cover more ground (eventually) - fixing it to a ""known good"" seed actually seems to me to be more of a mask of potential problems than this. Of note: the pytest plugin I'm using reports the number of reruns it performed in the analysis at the bottom - they show up in a yellow alongside the ""skips"" and ""xfails"" - so it's not completely hidden. I'd love to have a property-based testing suite like hypothesis up and running - that definitely seems like the proper solution to this in the end. In the meantime, I'm open to swapping to a fixed random seed if you think that's much better - testing is one place where I'm really aware of my lack of formal experience in software engineering, so I'm basically just learning as I go.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1490#issuecomment-815317227:483,failure,failures,483,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1490#issuecomment-815317227,8,"['error', 'failure', 'mask']","['errors', 'failures', 'mask']"
Availability,"I couldn't reproduce this with an install into a fresh `conda` environment, _but_ I did once see that same error when I tried to make an OpenMP and a non-OpenMP `qutip` coexist in the same environment. When that previously happened, the package actually worked, it just reported that error. My guess is that this happens if `pyximport.install()` has already been activated when `qutip` is imported, and consequently the test in `__init__.py` as to whether `qutip.cy.openmp.parfuncs` is importable causes this error. It should not be able to even attempt to import it _unless_ `pyximport` has been turned on, and if it's been turned on by something other than QuTiP, then it should fail with a `numpy` header file error instead (this is something we should probably fix too, but I've not noticed it before).

Availability,"I don't have xvfb (pytest-xvfb) installed specifically for qutip, but it is used by other packages (The general use of pytest-xvfb is to facilitate testing of GUI, graphical or windowing functionality without having an normal Xserver active. That is, it can be useful for automated CI testing of gui packages, for instance in chroots or cloud CI infrastructure). Since qutip doesn't use xvfb directly this bug won't be a problem for general CI testing, where only qutip is loaded on a cloud instance (for instance Debian testing done at https://ci.debian.net/packages/q/qutip/). But before I upload a package to the Debian infrastructure, I like to run the tests on my own system to be confident they're likely to pass. So this is where the problem happens, running tests on my own system, where I have pytest-xvfb installed for testing other packages. (pytest has this bad habit of loading all available plugins whether or not they're actually used by the tests being run. It's quite annoying actually. It would be better if it only loaded plugins specified in conftest.py). So the use case is running the qutip tests on my own system, where pytest-xvfb simply happens to be installed for other purposes not related to qutip. There are ways of working around the problem, for instance the `--no-xvfb` option could be explicitly added to the `pytest` command line.

So with a tol at 1e-8, the test can fail from numerical error with nothing wrong in the test. If you look are the sparse eigen solver, for a 100x100 matrix with only 10 non-zero values, all along the diagonal, it does not find any` 0` eigen values: there are about 89x `~e-36`, 1x `~e-17` and the 10 non-zeros values.

Availability,"I don't think this is the right way to solve your problem, but we probably should be consistent. `Qobj` is not a container for arbitrary data, and a 1x1 `Qobj` basically should never exist. If I remember correctly, the auto-promotion to `Qobj` is to avoid breaking backwards compatibility, because 4.x doesn't use the `@` syntax at all. We almost certainly should be moving to remove that ""feature"", not add to it - it should never work with compound Hilbert spaces (we should be safe-by-default), and trying to detect special behaviour on 1x1 inputs just leads to weird edge cases and breakages all over the place. You probably want some sort of different mechanism for deciding what types a `Qobj.data` instance can accept in `mul`. At the moment, the test is `isinstance(other, numbers.Number)`, but you want to accept `tensorflow.Variable` if the backing data is TF-like.

Availability,"I don't want the way to catch error depend on the map, `serial_map` and `loky_map` both return the error of the first failing iteration and stop there. Having `parallel_map` failing differently will mean that every time we want to catch an error in `mcsolve`, etc. we will have to catch both the expected error and the custom `ParallelMapException`. It also hide the kind of error and prevent us to act on it. I still think that stopping the map and returning the first error is the best options. It will ensure that all map functions fail the same way. In our case, the raised exceptions should be consistent so we should not need run all iteration to see every ways it can fail. And we don't waste computing time to compute result that will not be returned. Another options would to not raise any error and return the finished iteration. For mcsolve, we could have a result returning 99% of the asked trajectories with the note that 1% failed because of overwork from the solver. Trowing away all the work done for one error feels bad.

Availability,"I encountered a numerical error while simulating a Ramsey experiment using mesolve in QuTiP. Specifically, the simulation shows unexpected discontinuities and unphysical results in the oscillatory pattern. I have highlighted these problematic points with red circles in the plot for clarity.; <div align=""center"">; <img width=""314"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7a6fb3e-c9e8-4cf9-96ba-aefaf7e9a554"">; </div>. To make the problem clearer, I simplified the simulation model. The Hamiltonian used is:. $$ H_{\rm rot} = {\rm Re}[\Omega(t)]\frac{\sigma_x}{2} + {\rm Im}[\Omega(t)]\frac{\sigma_y}{2} $$. where $\Omega(t)$ is a time-dependent coefficient. The tlist and coefficients are both numpy arrays. Providing the entire code that generates these coefficients would be lengthy, so I preselected a few sets of coefficients and tlist where the issue is present. Specifically, the problematic data is from indices 92, 93, and 94, which have been highlighted in the plot. These are stored using np.savetxt. Below is the plot of the coefficients, showing that they are mainly real and differ only slightly. ```; plt.figure(); ax0 = plt.subplot(221); ax1 = plt.subplot(222). for wavedata_name in [""index92"",""index93"",""index94""]:; coef = np.loadtxt(f""{wavedata_name}_coef.txt"",dtype=np.complex128); tlist = np.loadtxt(f""{wavedata_name}_tlist.txt"",dtype=np.float64); ax0.plot(tlist, coef.real, label=f""{wavedata_name}""); ax1.plot(tlist, coef.imag, label=f""{wavedata_name}""); ax0.legend(); ax1.legend(); ; ax0.set_title(r""$\sigma_x$ coefficient""); ax1.set_title(r""$\sigma_y$ coefficient""); ```. <div align=""center"">; <img width=""314"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b07b3a64-a2d4-458b-a04e-4c83c0c4c093"">; </div>; Despite these small differences, the simulation results show significant and unexpected variations. ; Below is simulation code and results. ```; import qutip; import numpy as np; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt. sx = qutip.sigmax(); sy = ",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2552:26,error,error,26,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2552,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"I had a quick stab at this by adding a Metaclass to Qobj (I tried doing this within `__new__` but could not get it to work. If it's possible I accept suggestions). ; I am also unsure if your constructor `Qobj` is supposed to be called with positional, kwargs or a combination of both. If it was only kwargs the implementation could be more terse. I assumed that the `copy` argument gets passed as part of `__qutip_qobj_interface__`, as in the conversion it might be necessary to copy anyway so the downstream implementor is responsible for taking care of the copy if requested. ```python; class QobjMetaclass(type):; def __call__(cls, inpt=None, dims=None, shape=None,; type=None, isherm=None, copy=True,; fast=False, superrep=None, isunitary=None):. if isinstance(inpt, Qobj):; pass; elif hasattr(inpt, ""__qutip_qobj_interface__""):; inpt_data = inpt.__qutip_qobj_interface__(copy=copy). inpt = inpt_data['matrix']; dims = inpt_data['dims']; copy = False. obj = cls.__new__(cls, inpt, dims, shape, type, isherm, copy, fast,; superrep, isunitary); obj.__init__(inpt, dims, shape, type, isherm, copy, fast,; superrep, isunitary); return obj. class Qobj(object, metaclass=QobjMetaclass):; ...; ```; I'm quite sure this implementation can be improved, however. On the NetKet side, the implementation is very simple. At the moment we only support operators from H->H.; ```python; class AbstractOperator:; ... ; def __qutip_qobj_interface__(self, dims, copy=True):; return {'matrix': stacked_rows_to_stacked_cols(self.hilbert, self.to_sparse()),; 'dims': [list(self.hilbert.shape), list(self.hilbert.shape)]}; ```.

Availability,"I have a trouble in solving a time dependent Bloch-Redfield master equation with arguments.; Let me use an example discussed in [here](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/966); The schedule functions of the time dependent Hamiltonian are defined by using some parameters which are passed to mesolve as args.; This method works well for sesolve and mesolve.; However, if I try to use the same method in brmesolve, it returns error in compiling Cython. I attached a python code which demonstrates the above observation. . I also noticed that in bloch_redfield.py it says; args : dict ; Placeholder for future implementation, kept for API consistency. Would it be possible to use arguments in brmesolve? If not, how could I use parametrically defined schedule functions while avoiding the issue raised in [here](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/966)?. I need this for my research and I would appreciate your help very much.

Availability,"I have some detail information for the GSoC 2020 project ""Error mitigation in QuTiP"". Unfortunately, I don't have writing access to the QuTiP GitHub Wiki page. I post it here so if anyone finding it nice could copy it to the Wiki page. I add some details based on the original description:. -----------------------------------; ## 1. Error mitigation in QuTiP; From the QuTiP 4.5 release, the qutip.qip module now contains the noisy quantum circuit simulator (which was a GSoC project) providing enhanced features for a pulse-level description of quantum circuits and noise models. A new class `Processor` and several subclasses are added to represent different platforms for quantum computing. They can transfer a quantum circuit into the corresponding control sequence and simulate the dynamics with QuTiP solvers. Different noise models can be added to `qutip.qip.noise` to simulate noise in a quantum device. . This module is still young and many features can be improved, including new device models, new noise models and integration with the existing general framework for quantum circuits (`qutip.qip.circuit`). There are also possible applications such as error mitigation techniques [1-3]. The tutorial notebooks can be found at http://qutip.org/tutorials.html#nisq. A recent presentation on the FOSDEM conference may help you get an overview (https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/quantum_qutip/). See also the Github Project page for a collection of related issues and ongoing Pull Requests. ### Expected outcomes; - More devices defined in the `qutip.qip.device` module. At the moment, we have two models: spin chain and cavity QED. We would like to include some other commonly used planform such as Superconducting system, Ion trap system or silicon system. Each model will need a new set of control hamiltonian and a compiler that find the control pulse of a quantum gate.

Availability,"I know you've marked this as draft, but let me point out that you've not really aligned your `master` with ours after the merge (one of the reasons it's not a good idea to develop using `master`). You've merged in the changes from our branch, but really you needed to overwrite your local copy with ours; I squashed the previous PR down into just one commit to keep the commit log cleaner and easier to interpret. In this sort of triangular workflow where you're proposing PRs that might not be merged as-is, you need to treat our repository as the single source of truth - you should never change your `master` branch except by doing `git pull` to our repository, so you can't get out of sync. Since you've now developed on the top of an incorrect tip, it'll be a bit difficult for you to untangle if you're not very familiar with `git`. You _can_ do it with rebasing or cherry-picking techniques to keep what you've done, but in this particular case (and there's no way you could have known this), I was actually just about to publish PR #1490 that makes all these same changes in `test_metrics.py`, but also goes a lot further in rewriting the tests in a more pytest-y style. It might be better for you if you reset your repository to match ours exactly, and then start again using the proper branching structure for the superoperator and tensor tests you wanted to look at. Perhaps you could have a look at #1490 as well to see how I go about parametrising tests and organising everything to keep it tidy (not saying that my code is perfect by a long shot, and the concept of ""random"" tests is questionable overall, but it's what we've got at the moment). Remember as well that readibility is a big concern. Using an automated tool to enforce pep8 compliance often won't get you the best results - our real style requirement is that it's easy to read, so linebreaks should be in sensible places (that still abide by pep8).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1487#issuecomment-814998778:332,down,down,332,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1487#issuecomment-814998778,1,['down'],['down']

At the time, it was a bit of a hack to try and make it fit as well as possible, but I think in retrospect that may have been misguided.

Availability,"I might try and have a look tonight (UK time), if I have time - I've wanted to break up the large `propagator` monolith into smaller components for quite a while. ---. About numerical precision: if you want to try increasing the precision of the integrators, try passing `options=qutip.Options(nsteps=1_000_000, atol=1e-12, rtol=1e-10)` to `propagator`. `atol` and `rtol` are absolute and relative tolerances respectively, and `nsteps` is the number of subdivisions the integrator is _allowed_ to take (if it reaches its tolerance goals, it won't take all of them). You'll find that `atol` and `rtol` will have only a loose relation to the tolerance of your fidelity value, because there's a _lot_ of floating-point operations between those points in which the errors compound, and there's a hard limit on the tolerances the integrator can achieve, so you might not be able to get a perfect answer. The fidelity calculation involves finding the square root of a density operator, so that's another large possible source of error. About times: if you only care about the state at the last time, setting `tlist = np.linspace(0, x, 201)` is quite inefficient. Instead, set `tlist = [0, x]`, and then pass `options=qutip.Options(nsteps=<very very big integer>)`. It's more efficient because it doesn't need to achieve tolerance goals and construct/store `Qobj` instances at every intermediate timestep. Temporary workaround: this is _very_ temporary, and generally a bad idea in QuTiP, but you can ""flatten"" all your operators into a single space for now, while we implement a fix. To do that:; ```python; # initial setup; H = qutip.tensor(...); c_ops = [qutip.tensor(...)]. original_dimensions = H.dims.copy(); new_dimensions = list(H.shape). H.dims = new_dimensions; for c_op in c_ops:; c_op.dims = new_dimensions. outputs = qutip.propagator(H, times, c_ops=c_ops); for op in outputs:; # the ops are superoperators, so have expanded dimensions; op.dims = [original_dimensions, original_dimensions]; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1585#issuecomment-865903199:1636,toler,tolerance,1636,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1585#issuecomment-865903199,1,['toler'],['tolerance']

Availability,"I quite like this. I find the operator-to-vector-vector-to-operator casting too cumbersome. I also think its OK notation wise, since we typically use parenthesis when superoperators act on operators. Another option however would be to add this functionality to `Qobj.__mul__`, such that `Qobj.__mul__` is interpreted as 'acting on' if an operator is multiplied from the left on a state, or a superoperator from the left on an operator. Leaving out the parenthesis is also pretty standard notation. For the `Qobj.__call__` solution, I don't like so much that ""A(B)"" is interpreted as ""A B A.dag()"" when A and B are both operators though.

Availability,"I re-launched the Travis tests on all platforms. They pass for all besides Mac OS (similar error as for other PR). With `python setup.py install`, with `install` instead of `develop`, things seem to work. What it is unclear to me is why it reads that the QuTiP Version is `4.4.0.dev0+1a639d7a`, when I could not find this hash in here (or maybe I am confused). Now, after some tries with install and develop, I am on that version of qutip-dev. .

There could be much more commentary of the basics of `QobjEvo`. Some could be copy-pasted from the introductory comment in `qobjevo.py`. You are the best person to explain, with basic examples, of increasing complexity, what QobjEvo can do. Possibly taking a known physics problem, e.g., the damped harmonic oscillator with `mesolve`, could help the user. . * In [development-qobjevo.ipynb](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-notebooks/blob/master/development/development-qobjevo.ipynb), block 22 has the first check set to False, but this is both in the notebook I run locally and in the one online.

Availability,"I think `hypothesis` is the best method here in the long term, but it will most likely have to be a long-term goal. I think the main pro in favour of it is that it actually is making an attempt to remove randomness; it's attempting to comprehensively test a spanning set of input parameters, rather than just Monte-Carlo'ing our way through and hoping. There's a couple of points which make it difficult to implement:. 1. QuTiP can be quite fragile with respect to unexpected input formats, particularly in older parts of the code.; 2. Various components are only accurate up to some tolerance, and the error propagation to work out how that corresponds to useful measurable quantities can be rather tricky. Those are certainly both solvable problems, and point 1 in particular is just general improvement of usability. The second point is about designing the tests well, which again is certainly doable, but will take a while (it takes long enough just to refactor them, let alone a total rewrite of large chunks of them!).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-629272663:584,toler,tolerance,584,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-629272663,4,"['error', 'toler']","['error', 'tolerance']"

Availability,"I think it's quite important to understand why this happened. Previously we reliably had an exactly correct result, and now we don't. This particular check for `p != 0` of a float is I think okay because it's there specially to avoid division by exactly zero. I can think of at least two plausible scenarios:. 1. The issue was caused by the removal of auto_tidyup, in which case I think either a setting like this with an explicit check in either the measurement functions or the simulator are good solutions (although it should be possible to override the setting on a per-call basis, just like with atol). 2. The issue was caused by the removal of the data layer mathematical operations, and in particular, by the replacement of `data / value` by `data.mul(data, 1 / value)`, in which case I think the solution is to add a `div` operation to the data classes so that we don't lose this accuracy.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1656#issuecomment-917229773:76,reliab,reliably,76,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1656#issuecomment-917229773,1,['reliab'],['reliably']

Availability,"I think the module should really be `qutip.testing` (or `qutip.test` if the name's already taken), not `qutip.core.data.testing`, if you're going to add one. It's very likely to be the case in the future (if it isn't already) that you'll need additional dependencies to define the tests, and you don't want to force _all_ runtime users to have them to install QuTiP. If you put the package in a separate top-level module, it's _far_ easier to separate out all the code, and have `qutip/__init__.py` not import `qutip.testing`, so things won't break. Also, tests generally need to work with a fully imported version of the module. If we start putting testing infrastructure in the core, we're going to encode a whole lot of cyclical dependencies right away, or end up with `testing` modules scattered all across the codebase, for no real gain. For discovery: that would only happen during test generation, which comes after importing the modules and defining the classes, so you'd still be able to define tolerances and influence how the tests ran. The problem with _not_ having discovery is that it becomes very easy to forget to test a function, and with so much of the machinery automated, it's also easy to forget it when reviewing a PR. That's particularly true once you have external contributors writing these sorts of things - we have it in Qiskit, where people add things to our ""standard equivalence library"", and new contributors and new reviewers don't know where all the different tests are, so our discovery tests have helped catch bugs. That happens even with super experienced team members. I'd argue that code coverage metrics are possibly a better way of detecting missing tests - that fails safe if you add broken code and forget to test it, whereas having to specify the tests explicitly means you can accidentally add broken code to a dispatcher and not know, if you forgot to add the test.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-981562735:1004,toler,tolerances,1004,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-981562735,1,['toler'],['tolerances']

Availability,"I think there are two separate issues here. . As for the fortran module, it's true that the it adds a lot of build complexity, but most users do not need it and can easily install qutip without it. There is a case for removing it from qutip and put it in a separate module, but think this should be low priority, since it would require non-negligible amount work, would break backwards compatibility (it should bump next release to 4.0), and does not really provide any new features (other than a less complex code base). There might users who rely on it and for them it might be annoying if we remove it. So I would vote for postponing it until there are very strong arguments for removing it. As for the topic of this issue, I think that qutip should follow the lead of NumPy, even if it breaks backwards compatibility in the configuration methods, so that users that are familiar with NumPy and related projects does not have any surprises when using qutip. Also, if I understand correctly, this would mostly change how one configure and build against blas libraries such as openblas?

Availability,"I tried some experiments with elementwise exp with numpy to see if mkl did any parallel processing. It did not seem to. scipy.linalg.expm claims to use the Pade approximation. There used to be a expm2 (that used diagonalisation) and an expm3 (method?) but these have been deprecated. The scipy docs claim that the method used in expm is ""numerically more robust"". In the control modules we either use a eigendecomp (diagonalisation) method or scipy.linalg.expm_frechet as we typically need to compute propagators (which either uses the eigendecomp or is provided by the frechet deriv) . Frechet also uses some Pade approximation. I think the Pade method uses something like a LU decomp, but would need more research. It would always be more efficient to use the eigendecomp if it has been computed already. My guess is that if parallel LU decomp provides much (x100) faster eigendecomp, then the diagonalisation method would be much faster than expm. However, some experimentation would be needed to verify. . I am told that there are many methods of computing expm, and is there is much numerical research into it. It seems strange that scipy only offer us one method. The spinach control library (http://spindynamics.org/Spinach.php) reputedly has some interesting methods of computing expm. A quick Google search found https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/354, which shows that scipy considered adding a method kwarg, but have parked the idea. We currently have multiple methods in qutip based. I assume there must have been some motivation for writing our own sparse matrix functions for expm.

Availability,"I tried your suggestions but unfortunately nothing changes. I think my issue is with the way the rotating frame approximation is being implemented. Prior to this, my issue was that the graph couldn't be plotted over a large time scale because w0 is so high, so I added (w-w0) to H0. That fixed it, but I'm not sure how that affects the H1_coeff function. Is it as simple as including a (w-w0) term there as well, or do I need to adjust it some other way? As you can see, the pulse does exist, but for some reason nothing I change in the code causes the pulse to affect the graphs in any way. . Also, I realized that the heaviside function may not actually be appropriate for this situation. My goal is to create a pulse that spikes up and dies down, but the heaviside function is a step function so it spikes up and stays there.

Availability,"I understand completely!. I'd probably just go to `int64` with your internal CSR implementation for the moment. Would it be very easy to have the `int32`/`int64` boiled down to a single compile-time flag, for those people that compile QuTiP manually and feel they really need the smaller `int32` matrices? The pre-compiled pip/conda releases could be `int64`. That might be a simple way to provide some support for ""both"". Somehow, I thought that SciPy would put a lot more emphasis on performance, and do things like Kronecker products without conversion. It would seem that SciPy should be the place to really optimize the sparse linear algebra implementation, including all the possible combinations like `CSR * DIA`. Then everyone could build on top of that, making custom sparse-matrix implementation unnecessary. Maybe when someone gets some serious funding for working on QuTiP, encapsulating all of this better would be doable. So, just something to keep in mind before bolting on too many things onto the existing custom implementation (like multiple sparse and full storage formats). Once you open up that can of worms, it just might be better to re-design `Oobj.data` to have a very broad base (e.g. SciPy), and keep the custom CSR as an optional, highly efficient implementation for the special case, maybe in a separate package.

Availability,"I'd be interested in providing these changes. I have a few points to ask/consider:; 1. which function is meant by `zero_oper()`? I can't find any reference to it in the code, and judging by the name, I'd guess it's equivalent to `qzero()`, which already supports this.; 2. should we extend the automatic tensoring to other operators, e.g. `create()`, `destroy()`, and so forth? I can't necessarily think of any particular use-case, but _not_ having it causes an odd inconsistency with `qeye()`.; 3. for `projection()` and `basis()` in particular: should the interface allow only scalar `m` and `n`, which must be the same for all dimensions, or should there be broadcasting rules? The latter seems like a more useful choice to me, with the rules for all arguments being:; - if `m` is a list, then `max_len == len(m)`; - if `m` is a scalar, then `m = [m] * max_len`. For example, this would provide `tensor(basis(2, 0), basis(2, 1)) == basis(2, [0, 1]) == basis([2,2], [0, 1])`, which seems the ""least surprising"" to me.; 4. should there be error-checking that supplied scalars/lists are the correct format?

Availability,"I'd be vastly surprised if there's a way of permitting a test which passes 99% of the time - on any particular test run how would it know?. I don't remember having seen anything about setting the initial seeds, but relying on a previous test to set a seed isn't a good idea - you'd always have to ensure that no tests were ever added or changed in-between that ever used random state or everything would get lost. We could fix the random seed for any test which uses random methods with a fixture to get around that. I actually think this is a true failure; the default solver `rtol = 1e-6`, but here we're using `rtol=1e-7` as the test, so the test is bugged (it's probably not the only one, and I may have missed some of these in `mcsolve` too). I should change this when I convert `test_mesolve.py`.

Availability,"I'll add that it might be worth addressing the fact that there are two common conventions for representing quantum states as tensors that each have their pros and cons. Perhaps this would be better placed in a separate issue, but I'll explain here anyway. Consider a joint state like $` |\psi_1 \psi_2 \rangle \langle \psi_3 \psi_4 | `$ where the dimensions of $` |\psi_i\rangle `$ are $` d_i `$. Two common representations of this abstract state as a tensor are; 1. $` (|\psi_1\rangle \otimes |\psi_2\rangle) \otimes (\langle \psi_3| \otimes \langle \psi_4|) `$, which has shape $`(d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4)`$; 2. $` (|\psi_1\rangle \otimes \langle \psi_3|) \otimes (|\psi_2\rangle \otimes \langle \psi_4|) `$, which has shape $` (d_1, d_3, d_2, d_4) `$. These two conventions essentially correspond to the ""super"" and ""choi"" representations for channels. Representation 1. is nice when you are doing most of your calculations with pure states, but then want a density matrix towards the end, which you can do with just `np.tensordot(my_ket_tensor, np.conj(my_ket_tensor), 0)`. Representation 2. is nice when you are working with density matrices and want to combine multiple subsystems, which you can do with `np.tensordot(my_density_tensor_1, my_density_tensor_2, 0)`. Doing either of these operations in the other representation involves very error-prone index permutation in my experience. When I said above that these two conventions should be ""addressed"" in some way, I was intentionally vague because I'm honestly not sure what the best way to do that would be. One option would be to simply mention it in the user guide somewhere, perhaps near the section on the Super and Choi representations. Another would be to support both conventions via optional parameters like `to_tensor_rep(my_qobj, convention='super')` or `to_tensor_rep(my_qobj, convention='choi')`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2353#issuecomment-2007183867:1341,error,error-prone,1341,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2353#issuecomment-2007183867,2,['error'],['error-prone']

In particular, all of the superoperator representation conversions so far treat `type=""oper""` Qobj instances as acting by conjugation.

Availability,"I'm not at all a fan of making tests part of the public interface like this. It's something that we make absolutely no stability guarantees about, and coupling downstream packages to our own tests just sounds like a recipe for disaster - if we find a bug in main QuTiP and need to change tests or add methods (which we should be able to do completely freely), we're going to inject a ton of extra code into downstream packages, and may completely break them. To be honest, I'm not even wild about how we distribute our tests as part of the module code at all, but that's what we've got. It _could_ be ok if you import the test case base, and redefine your tests from there. We still don't make any stability guarantees about that, but it's conceivable that we could (though of course, the problem of ""what if we need to add methods"" persists).

Availability,"I'm not sure solution 3 will work as easily as this - if the user's `scipy.linalg.eigh` is broken, then calling it doesn't help, surely?. Also, I can reproduce the segfaults with both `np.ascontiguousarray` and `np.asfortranarray` on my machine, but it is a size of 64 that seems to reliably do me in. Script to reproduce:; ```python; import numpy as np; from scipy.linalg import eigh. def random_hermitian(n):; h = np.random.rand(n, n) + 1j*np.random.rand(n, n); return h + np.conj(h.T). for n in range(1, 101):; print(n); for _ in [None]*100:; x = eigh(np.ascontiguousarray(random_hermitian(n))); ```; and this segfaults on `n=64` reliably with the `pip` version of `scipy` (linked against OpenBLAS 0.3.7), and always succeeds with the `conda` version (linked against MKL 2019.4). Both `scipy` versions are 1.4.1 here. I did the most bare-bones install to test this:; ```; $ conda create -n blastest python; $ conda activate blastest; $ pip install scipy; $ python blas.py; ```; where `blas.py` is the repro script above. Doing this, `pip` pulls me OpenBLAS 0.3.7. Looking at the source of OpenBLAS, the whole heavy-lifting implementation is in Fortran - there's the classic LAPACKe C wrapper around the core Fortran LAPACK, but everything eventually goes down to the Fortran. If it helps, it's an out-of-bounds access error that causes the segfault for me, and the address it's trying to access doesn't look like dummy nonsense (`0x101b95010`). I'm pretty sure it's a nasty Mac/OpenBLAS bug. If the problem is particularly in `zheevr` we could swap the call to `eig` (instead of `eigh`) for Mac only, which should hopefully sidestep the problem, because it'll call `zgeev` instead. All recent pip installs of `scipy` link against OpenBLAS, so there's not much that can sidestep it there, other than mandating `conda` usage, because you can't relink `scipy` to decent libraries without compiling from source.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1197#issuecomment-628780955:283,reliab,reliably,283,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1197#issuecomment-628780955,4,"['down', 'error', 'reliab']","['down', 'error', 'reliably']"
Availability,"I'm sorry I don't have a huge amount of time at the moment, but just to add an extra point (that it looks like I didn't think about before): if we _do_ add this, then any method that requires an unconditional `import qutip` in downstream packages probably isn't a suitable solution - `import qutip` already takes far too long (though a lot of this is importing various parts of `scipy`, which another library might do on our behalf), and it means that they'd have to do their own import checking to handle optional dependencies. In that sense, (ab)using Python's duck-typing with a magic method might be the best way to break the dependency/import problem. I'm definitely still against implicit conversion to `Qobj` in pretty much any situation - I can imagine we could define a safe, fairly forward-compatible interface for letting people do `qutip.Qobj(x)`, but as it stands, that's the limit that I'd want the interface to be used for. I particularly am really against the idea of implicit conversion. I don't see an advantage to allowing QuTiP functions to act implicitly on other objects; it means our own functions are slower (because we have to explicitly test inputs on _everything_), and it restricts us more from improving `Qobj`'s internals, because we have to maintain compatibility with the interface. We'd never really be able to output anything _other_ than a `Qobj` without this, so there's no reason not to just have the user convert the inputs to `Qobj` explicitly themselves - that isolates the efficiency penalty so you only pay it if you need it, and it'll likely be clearer in the end anyway, because explicit is better for following the logic than implicit.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-908380301:227,down,downstream,227,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-908380301,2,['down'],['downstream']

There is a question here of whether we should specify our minimum supported numpy in ""install_requires"" in ""setup.cfg"" or not. - The majority of our test matrix should *build* qutip with oldest-supported-numpy to match what we distribute. - We should include at least one test run for the oldest numpy we require (i.e. oldest NEP) and one for the most recent (i.e. latest numpy). . - We should include at least one test run for the oldest Python we support and one for the newest. - We should include at least one test run for the oldest SciPy we support and one for the newest. - The NEP doesn't say anything about SciPy, but I propose we select the oldest SciPy that supports our oldest NEP numpy.

Availability,"If the initial state was found to be of type 'oper', no further testing was done in initialisation of mesolve on the dimensions. For example, if a user incorrectly created a density matrix, such as by doing; ```python; tensor(basis(20, 0), qeye(20)/20); ```; (presumably intending `basis(20, 0).proj()` or similar), it would have a type of 'oper' inside Qobj, and mesolve would recognise it as a ""proper"" density matrix, even though the shape was actually incorrect. Such an object would get passed down into the C layer, which does no shape checking, without having its shape explicitly tested, and eventually could cause a segfault in the matrix multiplication routine. The correct check in this setup is to test the shapes when passed into `mesolve`, if this is possible. If the Hamiltonian/Liouvillian is generated by a Python callable, we have to test every time the time-dependence function is called. A user could make a pathalogical function that changes its dimensions on different times, and we cannot allow a segfault.

Availability,"If we don't do `del numpy` in qutip's `__init__.py`, then doing this works:. ```; from import qutip *; numpy.func(...); ```. because numpy was imported but not deleted before the end of qutips init file, and it will be exported form qutip as a global symbol in qutips namespace (which is the callers global name space if called as above). However, this is not a desired behaviour of a module to do like this: importing qutip shouldn't impose that numpy is imported in any particular way (even though qutip uses numpy internally). For example, if a user prefer to import numpy as `np`, then it is pointless that qutip exposes numpy as `numpy` as well. It because even weirder when an import pattern like `import qutip as q` is used, because as it is now then numpy is available through `q.numpy`, which is unnecessary and causes problem with for example nose unit testing of qutip module (because it finds numpy and run all numpy tests as well) and also with module autocompletion in for example spyder and ipython. For these and many other similar reasons, it is neatest if qutip only exports its own symbols, and if a users requires any symbols of other packages they should be explicitly imported from those packages.

Availability,"If you're concerned about the solvers, a) they skip tidyup til the end anyway and b) _technically_ the computational complexity of CSR * dense vector is identical to tidyup (though tidyup is a little more cache efficient), but really it's the constant factors that could kill you for small systems. For example, the ""naive"" way of implementing a relative tolerance would take the absolute value of a complex number, but that involves a floating-point square root, which is a very slow operation. That's likely partly why the current version compares real and imaginary components separately, even though the sparsity structure is only improved if _both_ go to zero. In a two-pass operation you'd sqrt twice for every entry (naively - all the square roots are very avoidable), and I'd start to worry that that really _could_ dominate small system operations.

Availability,"In general in pytest we use the bare keyword `assert` for almost everything. All the functions in `np.testing` are from the ""before times"", when test tooling wasn't as good as it is nowadays - they were a big improvement on available warning messages back before 2015. Nowadays, though, `pytest` does introspection on assertion failures, so it has even better message reporting than the `np.testing` functions, and it lets you write much clearer code. For example, `assert_equal(x, y)` is much better spelled in pytest as `assert x == y`, because it's much faster to read and pytest does better error reporting for it. Similarly, testing for exceptions is better with; ```python; with pytest.raises(ValueError):; call_that_raises(1, ""hello, world""); ```; as opposed to the numpy form `np.testing.assert_raises(ValueError, call_that_raises, 1, ""hello, world"")` - the pytest one is much easier to read, and the error message is better. The only numpy one we still use is `np.testing.assert_allclose` when we're comparing several numpy arrays. That's just because `pytest` doesn't have a good function that's aware of multidimensional arrays (at least not one that I know). This file still has a load of old numpy testing code in it (e.g. `np.testing.assert_equal`) because it was written quite a long time ago, when that was the recommended way of doing things. We're changing over slowly, so we can take advantage of all the nice features of pytest. In this case, I changed `np.testing.assert_allclose(x, y, atol=tol)` to `assert abs(x - y) < tol`. I removed `np.testing.assert_allclose`, because that gives the mistaken impression that we're comparing arrays (we're not, we're comparing two scalars).

Availability,"In qutip-tensoflow, we aim to include TensorFlow's autodifferentiation with Qobj. However, this will require the following code to work:; ```python; import numpy as np; import qutip. random_matrix = np.random.random((2, 2)) + 1j * np.random.random((2, 2)); complex_number = np.random.random((1, 1)) + 1j * np.random.random((1, 1)). qobj = qutip.Qobj(random_matrix); qobj*complex_number; ``` ; I used numpy `ndarray` instead of a `tf.Tensor` or `tf.Variable` for simplicity and so that the example is reproducible. . Currently this example raises: ; ""TypeError: incompatible dimensions [[2], [2]] and [[1], [1]]""; as `__mul__(self, other)` defaults to `__matmul__(self, other)` when `other` is not an instance of `numbers.Number`. . If instead we do:; ```python; complex_number*qobj; ```; The error raised is:; ""TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'Qobj'""; This error is different because `__rmul__` checks first for `other` being an instance of `numbers.Number` and if not, it raises `NotImplementedError`. It does not check whether `Qobj(other)` works. I would say this is undesired and that `__rmul__` should try first converting `other` into `Qobj` and not assume that other is already `Qobj`. . **Describe the solution you'd like**; I would like to suggest either:; 1) changing the behaviour of `matmul` dispatcher so that (1,1) shaped data is multiplied element wise by default. However this, although not terrible, it breaks conceptually what matmul is, as a (1,1) x (2,2) matrix multiplication can not happen. 2) Allow `mul` dispatcher to have as input a `Data` object. In this way we would raise an error when the `Data` for `mul` dispatcher is not of shape (1,1) and perform an elementwise multiplication when it is. I am not sure how difficult it is to code this. 3) Create `mul_elementwise` dispatcher to have as input two `Data` objects and perform elementwise multiplication.

Availability,"In theory the `correlation_2op_1t` function is only valid when you pass in the steady state solution of the Liouvillian.

I _think_ it's fine in all cases, but perhaps Neill you can check me on that front?. I'd agree with Neill that truncation of the thermal state basis is likely the reason you were failing to get that to work exactly right. The tolerance calculation will actually be a bit more involved because QuTiP returns a normed dm.

Your `qutip.about()` output shows that you have installed version 5.0.3 on the one PC and version 4.6.2 on the other. Version 5 was recently released, and it is a major update and changes many of the internals of QuTiP. Old code should still work with version 5 in the majority of cases, but it is not guaranteed to always work. For old code, you might therefore prefer to use version 4 (the latest release of version 4 is v4.7.6).; * Your notebooks are rather long, and for a person who has not written them it can be hard to figure out what they do. If you would like to investigate in detail where the different behavior comes from, I would recommend to try to boil it down to a *short, self-contained* example script that gives different results in versions 4 and 5.; * The differing plots show values with a magnitude of $10^{-14}$ or so. That is rather small. By default, QuTiP's solvers use tolerances of $10^{-12}$, so you should not expect the numerical results to have a higher precision than that. In numerical calculations, it is generally recommended to rescale your units such that your parameters and results have a magnitude around $1$ if possible.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2501#issuecomment-2249560375:767,down,down,767,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2501#issuecomment-2249560375,2,"['down', 'toler']","['down', 'tolerances']"

Availability,"Knowing the tensor structure is still necessary for enforcing the Hilbert spaces are of the correct dimensions, even if the resulting state can't be written as a product of states on individual spaces. I think there's a lot more design to do to work out a sensible data structure which can really take advantage of this lazy representation, but my morning-after reaction to this is that it's very non-trivial without a lot of code duplication. It's easy enough to imagine how it will work for operators of structure `[scalar, oper, scalar] * [scalar, scalar, oper] -> [scalar, oper, oper]` - in this case the final result is fully expanded in the last two states, and not in the first. It's much trickier dealing with `[oper, scalar, scalar] * [scalar, scalar, oper] -> [oper, scalar, oper]`. In this case, since there's a subspace in between them, you need a specifically ""lazy"" Kronecker product. I suspect that this would have to be supported via either a completely separate `tensor` mechanism, or the mechanisms which currently underpin the data-layer `kron` would have to be revisited.

Availability,"Looking into the function `_mc_alg_evolve` in the source code of mcsolve, I have two questions in mind:; 1. Why do you divide the interval into each `tlist[k]` (`while ODE.t < tlist[k]:`) and run the ode internal step `ODE.integrate(tlist[k], step=1)` one at a time and evaluate `if norm2_psi <= rand_vals[0]:`?; Alternatively, can I run the ode `ODE.integrate(tlist, step=n)` without collapse until `norm2_psi <= rand_vals[0]`? It seems to be faster if `ODE.integrate(tlist, step=n)` can store the state. In this way I ignore `tlist[k]` totally.; 2. After `if norm2_psi <= rand_vals[0]:`, you find the collapse time to within specified tolerance. Can I just take the collapse time as the time immediately after `ODE.integrate(tlist[k], step=1)`? Since the step in the `ODE` should be small enough, would it make a lot difference by ignoring the steps of finding the collapse time to within specified tolerance?.

Availability,"Most of it is already in qutip or in development:; - We already have a progress bar.; - We have feedback to support solvers where parameters are changed depending on the current state.

We mostly use multistep method (Adams and BDF) which are particularly sensible to that.; - In my rework of `mcsolve`, I'm including the capacity to stop after a certain time, (already merged) and after the error bar gets under a certain tolerance. I have not though an equivalent for `me/sesolve` would be needed but it would be simple enough to add. We could have function that takes the expect value and tell the solver to stop or continue. ; - I was thinking of adding the ability to step through the evolution (draft in #1455):; ```; solver = MeSolver(H, c_ops, options=opt); solver.start(t0, rho0); for t in [t1,t2, ...]:; rho_t = solver.step(t, args=new_args); ```; Which would work like a `yield`:; ```; solver = MeSolver(H, c_ops, options=opt); for rho_t in solver.yield_run(rho0, tlist):; if needed:; solver.update_parameter(args=new_args); ```; I prefer using steps since you don't have do define `tlist` first, you could use it in a `while True` loop or interactively.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-858740451:314,error,error,314,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-858740451,6,"['error', 'toler']","['error', 'tolerance']"

Availability,"My thinking on this basically comes down to two points. First, the behavior of `composite` is explicitly not the same as that of `tensor()` or `super_tensor()`, as it's a common usecase to compose operators defined on different subsystems without reference to representation. While I agree that it would be good to have more generic wire-bending support in QuTiP, I think that's likely out of scope for this particular feature, as it would require some significant rethinking of how `dims` is currently implemented. Second, I think that it's entirely defensible that the current behavior of `composite` promotes operators by `spre() * spost()`, as this is consistent with the view that superoperators are matrix representations of group action by conjugation. That is, `composite` returns the composite of the same group action applied to each of several subsystems, though the action can be more general for `type='super'` arguments. This could perhaps be made more clear by renaming `composite` to `composite_oper` or similar, but I think that the _behavior_ of the current function is correct and consistent, if admittedly, poorly described.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/241#issuecomment-58038276:36,down,down,36,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/241#issuecomment-58038276,2,['down'],['down']

About pep8 changes: I'm not a maintainer, but it might be a good idea to be conservative about changing actual public APIs in the name of pep8. Changing public APIs that work fine means the users, who are the reason we're writing the code in the first place, have to adjust, and the pep8 spec explicitly warns against breaking backwards compatibility to match the pep. `N` is fairly consistent within `qutip` for the number of qubits, and the `U` in `U_list` refers to unitary matrices, which are conventionally a capital `U` in mathematical writing.

Availability,"Note: in theory you can install QuTiP from the test PyPI server right now by doing; ```; pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple qutip-jakelishman; ```; (that's just the name - you still do `import qutip`) but since it's on the ""wrong"" server, you first have to manually install `numpy` and `scipy`. When it's released properly on PyPI it'll handle the dependencies correctly - this is only an artifact of being on the testing server. Running that command will install a binary version with no compilation, and should work on any (reasonable) Linux machine, Mac (possibly not M1 chips) and Windows. It's possible you may get an error about `ndarray size changed ... this may indicate binary incompatibility` - if so, either force `numpy` up to the new 1.20 or down to 1.19 (whichever one you don't have). This was a breaking change in numpy 1.20. Per my reading of the release notes, it won't be an issue provided in the future we always build against `numpy>=1.20` (even when using lower `numpy` at runtime) because the new version updates a certain C-API macro to take into account the possibility of runtime variability. I have pushed an additional change to the build requirements to ensure this always happens. This has another knock-on effect: numpy 1.20 only supports Python 3.7+ (released June 2017). Currently, officially QuTiP supports Python 3.6, but I think it's reasonable to follow numpy's footsteps and **drop support for python 3.6 from qutip 5.0**. It's offset by gaining support for 3.9.

Availability,"Notionally fixes #1179, #1185. Converts the `os.system` calls to `subprocess.run` because they're now the recommended way of doing things. I check for existence of the dependencies at import time, and emit a warning (`ImportWarning`) if they don't exist. This is ignored by the typical warning filters, so it won't actually show up for most users. If a dependency doesn't exist, then we don't define the relevant methods on the `QubitCircuit` class to avoid IPython introspecting the class object and thinking that it can make a PNG/SVG. This may not be the best way of doing things, but in this delocalised setting I think it's easier to talk/discuss around a problem with an example in front of us. In particular, I think raising `NotImplementedError` on failing to find `pdflatex` might not be the right call: if it doesn't exist, then the PNG and SVG methods of `QubitCircuit` are currently still created, and then IPython would try to call them and produce an error that isn't the fault of the user.

Availability,"Oh yeah, I totally agree with that perspective - it's in part why I've gone on my little crusade over the past couple of weeks to remove all the warnings and errors from all the build processes. What do you think a sensible strategy is for handling bug fixes that touches code that issues complaints? CodeClimate will typically restate its complaint if you change a line that contributes to it (e.g. here I changed a ""return"" statement in a function that has too many). I guess there's either ""maintainers state whether any particular PR is acceptable with a failing warning""; ""write a [skip ci] commit message"" (or whatever it's called); or ""any PR that touches complained-about code must fix the error"". Without any experience, to my mind it seems like points 1 and 2 are basically the same, but point 1 gives the power to override to maintainers, and point 2 to contributors - seems like version 2 works well in a business where ""everyone"" is trusted to modify the code, but in the distribued opensource world, maybe not? Point 3 seems ideal in principle, but it seems like it would make it very hard to have first-time contributors do anything with older parts of the library - there'd be a huge onus to completely overhaul functionality, even just to fix small stuff.

Availability,"Ok, I think I may have some more information. I am fairly sure that this is the same bug as #1120, #963 and #944 (which I believe was not actually ever fixed). I'm going to put the information here. My working theory is currently that this is a MKL bug on Mac. For posterity, let me just dump out some information. ## Things you should know if you've not worked with segfaults before. - `Abort trap 6`, `Segmentation fault` and a few other points can all be from the same cause; - Segmentation faults are typically caused by reading or writing to memory that isn't owned by our process. These often occur by reading/writing too much data to an allocated pointer, or trying to read/write a memory location where the location was read from uninitialised memory.; - Segfaults will not always reliably occur. It's _very_ difficult to prove that swapping tools ""fixes"" a segfault; it can often just move around enough allocations to mask the problem, not fix it.; - Python stack traces are likely to be almost entirely unreliable in these cases, because the segfault may often occur while the garbage collector is running, and that will happen at seemingly non-deterministic times.; - Running files in a slightly different interpreter, running within a test runner with differing numbers of files, doing different work before and after will all cause the segfault to change, and may mask it.; - As annoying as they are, segfaults are actually the _good_ case of the bug - the worst is when we have invalid memory writes but _no_ segfault, because then we have memory corruption that's gone undetected. ## Thoughts about #1120. This issue is still present using Andrew's `Malloc.py` file as of the current master branch (commit 624405e7), and is in QuTiP 4.6.0 and most previous versions. I have been able to reproduce the segfaults with Python 3.7, but not Python 3.8, and I can reproduce it with all allowable values of `PYTHONMALLOC`.

Availability,"QuTiP is currently incompatible with numpy 1.20. Tests will fail to even collect with an error such as; ```; AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'dag'; ```; and a lot of functionality will break - anything that requires `Qobj.eigenstates()` for example. This is because `Qobj` defines `__array__`, one of numpy's ""array interface"" functions, intended for classes that can be safely converted _implicitly_ into an `ndarray`. This isn't really the case for `Qobj` - it loses all sorts of information when you do that, which is why we've maintained the separate `Qobj.full()` for explicitly getting the dense matrix representation of a `Qobj`. This is not to mention that numpy ufuncs probably should not be able to implicitly convert `Qobj` - I'd strongly argue that `np.sin(qutip.basis(2, 1))` should be `TypeError`, _not_ `array([[0. +0.j], [0.84147098+0.j]])` (like it is right now). We actually already removed this ""functionality"" in `dev.major`. The most pressing incompatibility is that a few points in QuTiP put a few `Qobj` into a `np.array(dtype=object)`. In numpy 1.20, this no longer produces a 1D array of `Qobj`, but a 3D array of complex. This breaks `Qobj.eigenstates`, and prevents test collection due to it being present in `states.py::qutrit_basis()`, which is called during parametrisation. There are a two possible ways to solve this, and we ought to release a fix with one of them in a patch ASAP:; 1. remove `Qobj.__array__`; 2. remove all use of `Qobj` in `np.array`. I'm personally in favour of ""explicit is better than implicit"" in this case, i.e. removing `Qobj.__array__` and relying on `Qobj.full()`. As another example along this vein, note `scipy.sparse` matrices don't implement this either, and they're arguably closer to being safely coerced to `ndarray` than we are. ### Related issues. #938: feature request for implementing `__array__`.

Presently we support both list ans dict output without much issues, there are very few place that would have issue supporting multiple interfaces. (I can only think of `plot_expectation`.). But how about using `namedtuple`?. It act as a list for loop and numpy, but elements can be called by both the number and name, and I like having result's output somewhat immutable. The biggest issue is that we must provide field names for list inputs... For MC, if e_ops callable return weird things, they will have to choose the option to store all trajectories instead of averaging the result. If they ask for the average or standard derivation of a dict, they will and should get an error, the best we should do is making this error message useful.

It's difficult to say that if there's a numerical error then the error will be much greater - I caught some errors in the `test_gates.py` (I think) that were sneaking through because the tolerances were set too high.

Availability,"So after starting with a fresh install of Anaconda and going through the steps described in https://qutip.org/docs/4.1/installation.html to install through conda-forge and conda, I am still seeing the same behaviour. However I have found a workaround that gives me exactly what I want. During my debugging I ending up adding the `b.make_sphere()` command, this seems to have caused the extra set of axes to keep appearing. I found that by omitting the `make_sphere` command and just replacing `b.show()` with `plt.show()` worked perfectly.; Heres my MWE; ```python; import qutip; import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; b=qutip.Bloch(). b.add_vectors([1,0,0]); b.render(). plt.show(); ```.

Hopefully this helps someone. @jakelishman I tried interactive mode toggling when this problem first occurred as that's what the behaviour reminded me of too. Gave it another go with my example in this text (replacing the `plt.show()` with `b.show()`) but still same behaviour.; I think it's to do with something similar to the problem/solution in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12369693/how-to-make-the-plot-not-disappear/12905317 as `self.fig` within the Bloch class is initialised in `render()` (and then called in `show()`) a similar way.

Availability,"So, while I agree that having a flexible storage format is a good way to go, the truth of the matter is that no one has time to implement such a big change. SciPy supports both 32 and 64-bit ints, and checks to see which ones are needed at runtime. e.g. a tensor product of two sparse matrices with int32, may need int64 in the result since their shape is larger. We could also do a similar thing, but it is a lot of work. The reason why we no longer use standard SciPy sparse objects is: 1) They tend to have a sizeable overhead when being created and/or manipulated do to redundant safety checks. 2) Many of the sparse operations are not well optimized. Because SciPy supports many different sparse formats, they had to generalize many of their core operations, making them slower. For example, the sparse kronecker product first converts to COO format, does the tensoring, and then converts back to the original format. Our method is much faster. Supporting more than just the current CSR format is also problematic. As already mentioned, there would be type checks, conditionals, and format conversions everywhere. e.g. what happens when DIA * CSR. As usual, available time is the limiting factor here. Support for both int32 and int64 is not that hard, but would take some time. Just int64 would make smaller matrices larger, but would allow for much greater system dimensions. In this later case, it would be a simple switch `int` -> `int64` and `size_t` -> `uint64` in the Cython code, and the fastsparse module (plus probably other places.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/850#issuecomment-384005667:574,redundant,redundant,574,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/850#issuecomment-384005667,4,"['avail', 'redundant']","['available', 'redundant']"

Availability,"Sorry I didn't get round to commenting on this PR sooner. Since it's now come up in #1579 around the subject of sorting out licensing in general in QuTiP, let me also note some stuff about that here. #1579 proposes to remove all individual-file licence text, because it is in general redundant, and makes it harder for us to centrally manage our licence. There is some concern (mostly mine), that it will be a little difficult for us to manage additional code which does not sign over copyright to the QuTiP admin team; if we accept it, we will have to keep the notice in perpetuity. This will pose a bit of a Theseus' ship problem for us if we ever want to re-organise the file that contains this code; after how many modifications is the code no longer NASA's, but QuTiP's? As long as it's not _ours_, we can't separate it out into different files, or mix it with other code (say additional implementations). I'm definitely not a lawyer, but I'm worried that will cause us code organisation problems in the future, and while the licence would give us permission to improve the code, it's the reorganisation I'm worried about. Secondly, about the code itself: this sort of local operation is something I absolutely would like to include, but I'm not certain that the form it's in right now is the best, general way to do it. I think this is part of much larger discussion about how to handle tensor networks - for example, at the moment, `targets` is fine for states and operators, but it won't work for superoperators. I'm not sure that this is solvable in an ergonomic way with QuTiP's current dimensions specifiers, but it's something we're definitely going to look into after the initial release of 5.0. Also, there are already several disparate functions in QuTiP that provide sort-of similar functionality, and I think we need to have a proper go at tidying them all up into one cohesive interface. This includes `subsystem_apply` (most similar to this), but also `ptrace` and `partial_tranpose",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405#issuecomment-864073566:284,redundant,redundant,284,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1405#issuecomment-864073566,2,['redundant'],['redundant']
Availability,"Sorry for the delay on the docstrings and so on, I think all suggestions should be incorporated now. However, thanks to Paul's suggestion of adapting the tutorial 1e. I realized that I made a ""mistake from the very beggining"", namely the function used to fit the correlation function is only good if the imaginary part of the spectral density is 0 at t=0, because I'm using. $C(t)=\sum_{k}a_{k}e^{-b_{k} t}e^{i c_{k} t}$. so . $C_{R}(t)=\sum_{k}a_{k}e^{-b_{k} t}cos(c_{k} t)$. $C_{I}(t)=\sum_{k}a_{k}e^{-b_{k} t}sin(c_{k} t)$. No matter how many terms I take $C_{I}(0)=0$. I should have realized before but this can be bypassed by excluding $t=0$ from the fit, and starting at a small t, you get a decent fit, as long as you don't look at C(0), and I never check for these situations before. The results of doing this are pretty decent, but updating tutorial 1e I realized it required higher calculation times for the HEOMSolver when compared to using another ansatz for the correlation function, since solving is the expensive bit then I changed the code use another function for fitting. $C(t)=\sum_{k}(a_{k}+i d_{k})e^{-b_{k} t}e^{i c_{k} t}$. The downside is that since this function has 4 parameters, it required changing other functions as well, luckily only functions starting with _, hopefully this won't delay the PR too much. I updated the tutorials with this as well, and added a bit so that passing the parameters for the fitting is easier (after this comment), if the change is not desirable we can just go back to the commit before this comment",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2260#issuecomment-1925945764:1151,down,downside,1151,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2260#issuecomment-1925945764,1,['down'],['downside']

Availability,"Thank you for your answer @Ericgig !. So, even though we are not using any quotes in our code, this internally maps to the string approach ?; I am trying to understand how to do what I want using callbacks instead, I could use a bit of help.; This is what the original code I shared here reads:. ```; # list of variational parameters ""a[]""; a=[]; for i in range(numite):; a.append(0.01*i). # define energy function by using variational parameters; def energy(a):; psi = initial_H.eigenstates(sparse=False)[1][0]; t = np.linspace(0, 1, timesteps+1); for i in range(numite):; 	H=[[initial_H,1-a[i]*t],[final_H,a[i]*t]]; 	result= qt.mesolve(H, psi, t, [], []); 	psi=result.states[timesteps].

I tried to understand the documentation here: http://qutip.org/docs/latest/modules/qutip/mesolve.html; What I think I need to do is the following:. - I need to just pass callbacks instead of formulas / strings for the coefficients when defining the operators.; - these callbacks must have a signature with the format `(t, *args)` and should return an np.array; - `t` and `args` values are passed as arguments to mesolve. . I am a bit unclear whether or not ""args"" is a list or a dictionary and how I can access it inside my callbacks. I made an attempt but it returns errors: maybe it would be easy for you to fix some lines of this example and tell me if I am on the right track? Or do you have a link to an example, maybe ?; I am just targeting the innermost portion of the code, here:. ```; mesolve_args = ... # a dictionary ? a list?

In that case I think it would be Ok to simply fail to parse the config file if configobj is not available. I don't think many users use the config file so would be to worried about breaking backwards compatibility with respect to this.; - I think I'd prefer to have the logging module called logging.py rather than _logging.py even though it is supposed to internal to qutip. ; - Please add a `__all__` list in logging.py; - Shouldn't configspec.ini be added to the setup.py file?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/248#issuecomment-61393881:405,avail,available,405,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/248#issuecomment-61393881,2,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"Thanks both @jakelishman and @hodgestar for your comments! I agree that I may be depending too much on the classes in `qutip.tests.core.data` to do the testing both in qutip-tensorflow and qutip-tensornetwork. I myself was worried of ""who is going to tests the tests"" if this trend continued with other packages. Reusing the `qutip.tests.core.data`'s code though helps to speed things up in the development process and also allows QuTiP to strictly define what each specialisation is meant to do. . As you mentioned above, I think it would be best to create a `qutip.core.data.testing` module where all the classes for testing are implemented. Then these classes could be tested to ensure that the proper tests are created and these classes ca be used by both QuTiP and downstream packages. I do not have time for this now but I will come to this later, so lets keep this PR open to discuss any ideas!. ----. > the data layer tests should really discover the specialisations rather than us needing to specify them (this is true regardless of this PR). I am not sure about this one. Automatic discovery of tests for specialisations seems to lead to very restricted flexibility in how tests are parametrized. For instance, I needed to change the `rtol` to accommodate the tests for the complex64 data layer in qutip-tensorflow and I am not sure how this could be added automatically. . Also, as @hodgestar mentioned today, you probably want to be explicit on adding tests so that you are confident that those tests are running. Otherwise you need to constantly check the log to ensure the proper tests are running. . Another thing is that by being explicit on what is tested, you could assert if the tested specialisation has not been registered (which actually happened to both qutip-cupy and qutip-tensorflow before: specialisations where being tested but, surprisingly, they were not registered).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-981550356:770,down,downstream,770,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-981550356,1,['down'],['downstream']
Availability,"Thanks for looking deeply into it. It's good to know the cause. We shouldn't remove support for SciPy 1.4 unless we _absolutely_ have to. Most users won't use matrices that large so won't be affected, and SciPy 1.5 is only a year old which is too recent to be a requirement in an academic setting. We should maintain at least a 2-year dependency window (like NumPy). Any constraints we make on allowable versions affect any packages downstream of us as well, so we want to try and stay as permissive as possible, as long as there's not new features that we absolutely must have. We already have mechanisms for working around an unstable `eigh` implementation because of problems with mac OpenBLAS `zheevr` in some cases, so we can add in this additional test when setting `eigh_unsafe` in our initialisation. The principle is that we decay to using the general-purpose `eig`, and include a specific orthonormalisation step to stabilise the eigensystem afterwards. This code is already in `qutip/sparse.py`, so it shouldn't be too hard to add an extra condition in `qutip/__init__.py`. Could you also test if the issue is also confined to MKL, or if it persists in OpenBLAS with SciPy 1.4 as well? We lose precision when swapping down to `eig` in place of `eigh`, so it's good to confine the switch to the minimum known-bad set.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1491#issuecomment-818719109:433,down,downstream,433,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1491#issuecomment-818719109,2,['down'],"['down', 'downstream']"
Availability,"Thanks for reporting this - it's an important bug that's snuck in. Right now, there's a few errors in your code that you can fix to get on your way again, but we need to fix the error on our side. You're using `sigmap()` which is the Pauli excitation operator and is only defined for a Hilbert space with dimension 2. You actually are working with a Hilbert space of dimension `nmax * nmax` (a tensor-product space), so your `e_ops` argument to `sesolve` is wrong - it's difficult to know exactly what you meant here. `destroy(2)` is equivalent to `sigmap()`, so it's possible you intended to have `e_ops` be `[qutip.tensor(a1, a2)]`?. ---. Maintainers: The error is actually a segfault, because QuTiP 4.5 (probably 4.4 too) does not do sufficient error checking on`e_ops` arguments - probably they're missing in the conversion to `CQobjEvo`. When the expectation is called, it has already sidestepped `Qobj`'s dimensions check and there is no matrix size check, so it simply segfaults on OOB access. The fix for the 4.x branch is to have a very loud Python-space error due to mismatched `Qobj` dimensions on entry to the solvers, or insert a size check within `CQobjEvo`. High priority: there's no reason we should be segfaulting here. Partially fixed in the 5.x branch; all matrix multiplications that take place in C-space have a size check and throw a Python exception, however the solvers still sidestep the `Qobj` dimension check so a tensor-product-space mismatch will not be detected.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1374#issuecomment-717495492:92,error,errors,92,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1374#issuecomment-717495492,10,['error'],"['error', 'errors']"

Availability,"Thanks for your replies @BoxiLi @Ericgig , very helpful!. The output seems right after adding the `max_step` option to mesolve().; We changed the width of the cosine shaped pulse, here are some simple observations.; ```; if width = 20, then setting max_step < 27 can produce the correct answer.; if width = 50, then setting max_step < 70 can produce the correct answer.; if width = 100, then setting max_step < 130 can produce the correct answer.; ```. But as we are most caring about how to use the solvers correctly, we still have some doubts:; 1. We only observed two results, one is 'perfectly correct', and another is 'totally wrong' (Like @Ericgig said, the second pulse has been completely skipped over). Would some fault result in the middle happen? Some wrong result very similar to the correct would be even worse. 2. The Ode version of mesolve function is very fast, which is one of the reasons we love it. But we did not find document about other solvers (raw propagator, flatten to Liouville space?) for the master equation.

Availability,"Thanks very much @Ericgig for preparing this!. I feel like it will be quite confusing if gates like `cnot` have different signatures than the ones in qutip-qip. Moreover, many of those gates/transformations are not only relevant to `qip`, but also used in other applications, so maybe we should keep more of them in the main qutip. One of the reasons that we want to include those gates into `qutip.operators` is because a few other downstream packages (e.g. `krylovsolver` that is now merged into qutip, and `qutip-tensornetwork` also uses Hadamard transform) also use them for testing (only) purposes. Having them in the main qutip may save them from depending on qutip-qip. I guess it would be better if we either; - Remove all qip and only define a few `_cnot`, `_swap` as private functions for testing inside the main qutip. And ask whoever else wants to use some gates to install `qutip-qip`. This may result in e.g. `qutip-tensornetwork` depending on `qutip-qip or having to implement a copy of some gates. or; - Include some more commonly used gates like `rx`, `ry` (they are unitaries generated by the Paulis and directly relevant to quantum control) `iswap` etc and keep them identical to the ones in qutip-qip, so that those who just want some gates for testing does not have to download the full qutip-qip. If the problem is the `qutip.qip.expand_operator`. I would argue that we can even include it into the main qutip. It is `tensor` + `permutation` and works not just for qubit systems, but also for other composite Hilbert spaces (provided a `dims`). It is quite handy not just for `qip`, but also for control and probably some other applications.

Availability,"Thanks victor!  My main worry as it stands is that, as I mentioned in the previous issue, this fix, on its own, introduces an unwanted additional error for the case with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, as then that time dependence essentially gets shifted twice, once by the H_shifted change, and once again by adding tlist[idx] to tau_list. ; This case of a time-dependent H could do with a test as well I guess. . This can be easily remedied by completely omitting the old method of shifting the time-dependence (e.g., using H and c_ops instead of H_shifted and c_ops_shifted in the call to mesolve(), for example).    But I am a little concerned that the the old method of shifting the time-dependence in H_shifted and C_ops_shifted was there for a reason.  @Ericgig any thoughts?. As an aside, I guess _correlation_mc_2t()  also needs a fix, but maybe better to do that in a separate issue.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1929#issuecomment-1153462129:146,error,error,146,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1929#issuecomment-1153462129,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"The `Qcircuit.tex` PR was unfortunately many many years ago, long before I made my first commit to QuTiP (according to `git log` it was by Anubhav Vardhan in 2014), so the damage is already done. It was on my mind because there was a PR about updating the version of the code in it (#1187). Nonetheless, we definitely should remove it. @BoxiLi Boxi: `Qcircuit.tex` is a concern for `qutip-qip` more than the main library from 5.0 onwards - it's currently in `qip/circuit_latex.py`, which we'll have removed, but you've gained. It might be most appropriate to handle this the same way Qiskit does - generate code which does `\usepackage{qcircuit}`, and leave it up to the user to have a properly-provisioned LaTeX environment. I note that `qcircuit` is included in MikTeX and TexLive since at least 2018 (but not sure when exactly it was added). > Yeah putting years I think is the correct thing. Didn't know that at the time. Ah, that's good to know, thanks. I'm trying to learn more about licensing - I'm trying to get it sorted now into the right form, but it's a really complicated field.

That's also why we might want to remove the general licence text from each file - it's already redundant, but it'll be much harder to update if we have it scattered everywhere (automation would run the risk of us messing up and changing any external code's licence as well, I think, which would be wrong). > Look forward to talking to you in July!.

I'm simulating a single trajectory using `general_stochastic` and plotting the returned expectation values along with expectation values calculated from the states. There is also a theoretical solution for the variances of X and Y, which are deterministic despite the stochastic evolution. The manually calculated expectations match the theory perfectly which means the states are correct. The returned ones accumulate errors and obviously shouldn't be used.

The argument from Liouvillian doesn't work here - even before the new data layer, `liouvillian` never called the `tidyup` code because it accessed the `Qobj.data` field directly, rather than used `Qobj`. Since it then goes into `CQobjEvo` in most of the solvers, which also don't touch the `tidyup` code, it doesn't get called. I don't think there's any safe way to know if small values should actually be zero, or if they're just small values. It makes sense that we want to maintain as much sparsity as possible when values are truly zero, but I think having the QuTiP default be to attempt to tidy up after every addition, multiplication and matrix multiplication is quite unsafe, and for people who aren't doing very very sparse calculations, it's actually a slow down.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1349#issuecomment-680011384:1141,down,down,1141,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1349#issuecomment-680011384,2,['down'],['down']

This would not be a problem in a `conda-forge` release build, because the `numpy` API dependency is pinned in the feedstock, but it is a potential problem on `pip` source builds.

Availability,"There are two reasons I did not go with `isinstance(other, numbers.Number)`:; - This returns False when `other` is a NumPy array or TensorFlow tensor which makes `__mul__` significantly less flexible.; - If we accept objects that are not instances of `numbers.Number`, we will still have to use `complex(other)`. This is necessary to infer if the output is hermitian or unitary. Hence, instead of doing a set of `isinstance` checks and `shape` checks for NumPy TensorFlow or any other future library we may want to be somewhat compatible with, we just check whether other it can be casted to `complex`. If it can, `mul` makes sense and we let the specialisation do whatever they ""want"" (they could always just do complex(value) in any case). I must admit that the try except with complex also seems not ideal to me. But I could not find a better implementation that fitted the requirements. I mean, we do use this same code pattern at some other points in the code (in `__matmul__` we raise not implemented if `other` can not be casted to Qobj and we catch this with a try) but what worries me is: what happens if `complex(other)` raises TypeError not because we do not know how to do the cast but because the user made a mistake in the code? An example of this could be:; ```python; arrray = np.array([1,2]) # length 2 array; qobj*array; ```; This will return `TypeError` but with a different message if we catch it in the `complex(other)` try execpt. ; - _With_ a try execpt that returns NotImplemented (current implementation) the error message is:` TypeError: operand 'Qobj' does not support ufuncs (__array_ufunc__=None)`; - Wehreas _without_ the try expect (not returnt NotImplemented if `complex(other)` fails), the error message is: `TypeError: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`, which could be a useful error message.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1620#issuecomment-885550798:1534,error,error,1534,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1620#issuecomment-885550798,3,['error'],['error']

The problem is that not everything uses the default filters; both `pytest` and the documentation build do not suppress all `DeprecationWarning` messages. This was a particular problem in `pytest`, where approximately 68,000 warnings (!) were generated. Since this is _not_ deprecated functionality, nor is it using deprecated functionality, so there shouldn't be any warnings. This PR removes those as well. The end result is that a completely clean documentation build now should generate 0 warnings. My eventual intent is to create an automatic documentation build process, which treats warnings as errors to prevent us from breaking it in PRs. This cannot happen until the merger of the documentation into this repository, however, because otherwise new features/feature removals could get into an impossible situation where the two PRs to `qutip` and `qutip-doc` would not be aware of each other, so would return failed CI.

Availability,"This PR fixes every warning reported in `pytest`, and then makes `pytest` treat warnings as errors to hopefully make sure we stick to this state of affairs. (Or at least it fixes all the ones that appear on my particular machine...). The reason this is desirable is that it means we cannot ignore deprecation warnings in dependencies or even in our own code. It also helps us not let certain parts of the codebase get lost in the sands of time, or at least compels us to do something about potential problems before they actually become catastrophic. This is _somewhat_ of a trial, though I hope we can stick to it; warnings usually indicate that something's wrong. Tests can still test run code that generates warnings, but you now have to mark it explicitly in `pytest`. This doesn't mean you should just ""blank out"" warnings by filtering them away. You should first consider if what you're doing is the right way to do it (fix the warning), and then only if it absolutely is and you're testing something that is _supposed_ to warn, then you can use `pytest.warns` to _assert_ that it warns. Of note: a `warnings.catch_warnings` block _inside_ a test (i.e. in test code, not module code) does not work when `pytest` is treating warnings as errors. There are a few classes of fixes in this PR:. - filtering ""expected"" warnings from `pyximport` (hoping to remove QuTiP's dependence on this in 5.0 anyway); - removal of the old `np.matrix` type in favour of `ndarray`, with some changes to accommodate the different arithmetic semantics; - convert an `__init__` method in a test into just class attributes to allow `pytest` to collect it; - bug fixes for behaviour that was raising warnings we hadn't been paying attention to.

Availability,"This all seems incredibly complicated. How about all specialisations stored in the dispatcher take `object` as the scalar type, and throw a TypeError if they can't handle it. `Qobj.__mul__` just does a `try/except`, and returns `NotImplemented` if it catches a TypeError. If it doesn't catch a type error, it calls a separate function, something like; ```python; @functools.singledispatch; def _scalar_properties(x):; return {; # if the matrix was Hermitian, is the output Hermitian (True), or not known (False); 'preserves_hermicity': bool,; # regardless of the input matrix, is the output Hermitian (True), or not known (False); # (i.e. was the scalar zero-like).; 'forces_hermicity': bool,; # if the matrix was unitary, is it still unitary (True), or not known (False); 'preserves_unitarity': Optional[bool],; }; ```; Then just register types with the functools dispatcher?. So then `Qobj.__mul__` looks like:; ```python; def __mul__(self, other):; if isinstance(other, (Qobj, QobjEvo)):; return self.__matmul__(other); try:; out = _data.mul(self.data, other); except TypeError:; return NotImplemented; properties = _scalar_properties(other); isherm = properties['forces_hermicity'] or (self.isherm and properties['preserves_hermicity'] or None); isunitary = self.isunitary and properties['preserves_unitarity'] or None; return Qobj(; out, copy=False, dims=self.dims, isherm=isherm, isunitary=isunitary,; ); ```; (I've probably not got the property truthiness checking exactly right, but that's the principle.)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1620#issuecomment-889018969:299,error,error,299,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1620#issuecomment-889018969,1,['error'],['error']

Really it should be a properly dispatched implementation of `einsum`, but I think this should come in as part of a much larger discussion on how to handle tensor networks completely; to have it be nice and ergonomic in all cases, I think this will come in at the same time or after the introduction of new dimensions objects.

At the time we fixed those tests (#1298, #1301), but this intermittent failure of `test_diag_liou_mult` may have slipped through. Equally, at the same time on `dev.major` I think I was moving the `brtools` internals to use the new `CSR` types, which involved rewriting things like `diag_liou_mult`. I don't think this is the cause (though I may have done at the time), because we see the intermittent test failures still on `master`, which does not use the new types yet. I'm not absolutely certain the `eigh` changes are the cause, which is why I don't want to just bump up `atol`/`rtol` in the test without going through and calculating what the acceptable tolerance _should_ be.

Let's have only one function element type that accepts functions of the form `f(t, ...)` where `...` is any signature that does not include `POSITIONAL_ONLY` arguments (i.e. no `/`) or a `VAR_POSITIONAL` argument (i.e. no `*args`) and is implemented as follows:. When the function element is constructed, we use `inspect.signature(f)` to:. * raise an error if any `POSITIONAL_ONLY` or `VAR_POSITIONAL` arguments are present; * determine the list of `POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD` argument; * determine whether a `VAR_KEYWORDS` argument is present. When the function arguments are updated:. * if `VAR_KEYWORDS` was present, we just keep all arguments; * if not, set the arguments to just `{k: new_args[k] for k in argument_list}`. When the function element is called:. * we can just just call `f(t, **args)` as before, because `args` already contains either just the named arguments we want or all the arguments if a `VAR_KEYWORDS` argument was present in f.

Availability,"This is a tidied up and completed version of #934. The first commit is credited to the original author (although I fixed up some little concerns in the PR and rebased it), because it's logically built off that PR, although in the end it's a complete reimplementation. This is a complete rewrite of the Husimi Q calculations, to make a more formal split between the iterative (low-memory) and precomputed (faster) algorithms, giving full access to both of them. It's a bit easier to use from a user's perspective, and it's faster than #934 as well. The concept of the precomputed matrix is encapsulated into a class with a cached tensor, so that the same precomputed system can be used for many states of different sizes, and autoexpands (up to the memory limit) to accommodate larger states. This is called `QFunc` as opposed to the standard function interface `qfunc`. It also adds rather more error checking on its inputs, and adds a complete testing suite for the new implementation. Closes #934. ## Examples. Let's say we have some states, and the phase-space coordinates we want to calculate the Husimi Q function at.; ```python; >>> import qutip; >>> states = [qutip.rand_dm(32, density=0.2) for _ in [None]*100]; >>> xs = np.linspace(-2, 2, 401); ```. Now the normal way of calculating the Q distribution for a single state is; ```python; >>> qutip.qfunc(states[0], xs, xs); array( ... ); ```. This already has some speed advantages over the pre-PR version of `qfunc`, because it caches a lot of its intermediary results, to avoid recomputing them. This results in calculating more matrix-vector products than before, but far fewr FLOPS overall. By default, `qfunc` issues a warning if it exceeds a certain amount of memory, and falls back to the low-memory version. You can control this limit with the `precompute_memory` option:; ```python; >>> qutip.qfunc(states[0], xs, xs, precompute_memory=0); qutip/qutip/wigner.py:822: UserWarning: Falling back to iterative algorithm due to lack of mem",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1583:895,error,error,895,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1583,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"This is causing test failures in all CI builds against scipy 1.5 currently. The other failing tests on scipy 1.5 are due to changes to the handling of `csr` matmul operations, which is fixed in patch #1298. As far as I can see, there is no way to recover the exact same behaviour as existed in scipy < 1.5 (there's optimisations of the `lwork` input to the LAPACK routine), and consequently we are not getting the exact same set of eigenvectors for problem dimensions > 32. This does not mean that `brtools` is suddenly doing something wrong. It just means that the test assumed we would have the exact same output as `scipy`, and we don't any more. . This is an annoying problem to fix, I think. Two possible methods:. 1. attempt to ""trick"" scipy into doing the same pre-1.5 behaviour. Possibly this would involve monkey-patching out the ability of `eigh` to optimise the `lwork` parameters (i.e. stubbing out `scipy.linalg.lapack._compute_lwork` to always return `lwork=18*nrows`, `lrwork=24*nrows` and `liwork=10*nrows` to match `qutip.cy.brtools.ZHEEVR`).; 2. do some linear algebra work to determine that the eigenvectors we have returned are equivalent to the ones scipy has returned. 2 is a better solution, but harder to implement, especially in the presence of degenerate or near-degenerate eigenvalues (of which there are likely a lot around 0). 1 is very unsatisfying, but might be enough. In general, this problem will hopefully be solved a bit more thoroughly when `brmesolve` is updated to use the new data layer types, and we standardise the calculation of eigenvalues and -vectors across QuTiP.

Availability,"This is my first attempt at fixing and slightly extending the functionality of the countstat_current_noise(); function in countstat.py. There were several issues with this function, which I have attempted to rectify as described below. Also its my first pull request (instead of asking anubhav or alex to help), so if I messed it up let me know. 1) The default method, a direct solution using sparse matrices, would fail with an ""exactly singular"" error on small examples (like the well studied single-resonant level or double quantum dot examples). The other sparse methods also suffered from the same issue, as did the 'direct' method for dense solutions. The latter, the dense matrices solver, I have fixed by capturing the error using lstsq() if np.linalg.solve() fails. For the sparse cases there seems to no equivalent fix. One can solve the issue by adding a small finite frequency to the definition of the shot noise. However, this seems like a bit of a bodge, and could cause issues if this small frequency is of the order of some system frequencies. So I have changed the default behavior to use the dense solvers, and added a description of the sparse matrix issues in the function description and in an example notebook I will upload to the example notebooks github. . Maybe someone can suggest a better fix?. 2) There was, in addition, an error in the definition of the shot noise formula in the default sparse matrix direct solution. In addition, the dense methods which used pinv() were also incorrectly defined (they were missing pre and post- multiplication by the 'Q' operator), and would thus give different results from the direct solutions. These issues have been fixed, and everything now fits expected analytical results (see example notebook). 3) I have added a frequency dependence via a list of possible frequencies at which to evaluate the shot noise. 4) I removed the option of passing a pseudo-inverse to the function directly, and changed various other interface things.

Availability,"This moves our entire testing apparatus over to GitHub Actions, since Travis has changed its pricing model and we can no longer rely on it. This actually has several advantages for us right now:; - better integration with other GitHub Actions workflows; - more concurrent jobs; - more access to Windows and macOS machines; - easier job dependency graphs within our resources. This first commit does not add in any Windows tests because they're currently known to fail, but the intention is to turn them on. The blocking issue is currently a failure of the multiprocessing capabilities, which also affects mcsolve. We can now reasonably run coverage reporting on every test run, and upload all of them to Coveralls at the end, so we get accurate stats on what lines were actually tested. I've also turned pytest's timer, so it reports all tests that took longer than a second to run. This should really help identify where the real problems in our testing are - right now you should see that there's a `correlation` test that takes around 2 minutes to run, which is a very sizable chunk of the entire test suite. We can concentrate on rewriting the longest tests to make sure we're still testing all the behaviour, without excessively long runtimes. I've been fairly conservative with the number of tests I set in motion. On the free GitHub plan we can have 20 concurrent VMs running across the whole QuTiP organisation, which I think spreads across all repositories and all test runs. With no Windows tests currently active this is 6 test runs plus the documentation build.

This patch should (mostly) apply cleanly to `dev.major` as well, so merging this up will be easy - the new automated systems in `setup.py` also mean that the distribution can handle both the current `master` and the `dev.major` package layouts with no changes. The rest of this text is very similar to the original message in #1429. ---. This patch overhauls how QuTiP is packaged and distributed.

This action is triggered manually, and the wheels will be available for download afterwards.

I couldn't reproduce the failures with MKL, so I'm fairly sure this is to do with our use of `eig` instead of `eigh` on Mac/OpenBLAS to avoid segfaults (see #1197, #1288). This makes some sense - the tolerances of `eig` are effectively slightly more permissive than `eigh` when dealing with real numbers, because there's more scope for an eigenvalue to be different by having a small imaginary component (contributes in quadrature) as opposed to only having the linear difference. I'm pretty confident that there's no logic error that caused the tolerances to slip a little, it's just a reality of dealing with an imperfect eigensystem solver, so I've relaxed the test tolerances by just a little.

The`.` is for cutting down the name in the *input*, e.g. you could write `` :func:`.mesolve` `` instead of `` :func:`qutip.mesolve.mesolve` `` anywhere, and Sphinx will search its internal index for any fully qualified name that ends in `.mesolve` and use that.

Availability,"To me this is a question of what guarantees our primary type makes, so it's quite a big decision to be taken. I'm not sure I agree that implementing `__array_wrap__` is a good idea - `Qobj` does not support ufunc semantics, and implementing that implies that we're a similar class to `ndarray`, which I don't think we are. I don't think `np.sin(qobj)` should return `ndarray` _or_ `Qobj`; I think it should be a TypeError. To me, we should be rather conservative about adding features like that when there's little tangible benefit - when there's a slightly more explicit alternative syntax, it's better to fail-safe than add potential ""gotchas"". The fact that elementwise operations are not part of the algebra of `Qobj` should be enough of a reason to cause you to have to explicitly ask for it, otherwise it tacitly _becomes_ part of the algebra. For your point three, if that's the case, I'd argue you're doing something wrong: are you constructing the `Qobj` before you've finalised your data? Shouldn't it be; ```python; incomplete_data = np.array([[theta, 0, 0], ...]); return Qobj(np.sin(incomplete_data)); ```; not; ```python; return np.sin(Qobj(incomplete_data)); ```. As a compromise, we could ensure that all our data-layer types (`CSR`, `Dense`, whatever else) will support ufuncs with ndarray syntax; then you could do `Qobj(np.sin(qobj.data))` to be explicitly elementwise if you really wanted, rather than absolutely requiring you to produce a full dense matrix. I'm still not sure I see the use case there, though. I'm in favour of removing `np.array([qobj1, qobj2, ...], dtype=object)` usage inside QuTiP no matter which way we come down on this, though. As far as I recall from seeing it, there no reason to use `ndarray` over a regular Python list in any of our internal use, and it's rarely (if ever) actually returned out of a QuTiP function. Given it might cause subtle differences between different numpy versions, probably best to avoid it.

Availability,"Two small bugs appeared in floquet steadystate in v5, this is a quick patch. **Description**; Two bugs:. 1) Small minus sign error in one of the terms (comparing to v4.7 and what is written in the old toolbox guide). 2) Some kind of data copying confusion with the S and T operators when updating their data contents with the results. Just initiating these two separately seems to fix it. other minor fix: updated the link to the toolbox guide. Some other minor niggles that I didn't fix:; - some of the optional solver methods dont work (seem not to support square right hand sides in '_data.solve()'. I didn't dig much on fixing these though. - the 'splu' method fails for a couple of reasons. I can get it to work by removing the choice of warnings as errors in 'solve.py' (which make it fail in other instances as well i suppose, like with normal steadystate()), making sure the solver option is not passed to steadystate(), and making sure that S and T are always converted back to CSR() after being updated in the iterative bit (in `steadystate_floquet()' they get returned as dense from _data.solve). I did not include those changes here though as the docstrings dont actually indicate support for splu anyway, so perhaps not needed. I am marking this as draft at the moment as I also want to update the test to be sensitive to these bugs (its a bit too coarse at the moment), and double check that the results from this solver are now correct. **Related issues or PRs**; fix #2386",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2393:125,error,error,125,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2393,2,['error'],"['error', 'errors']"

Until the most recent release (4.4.1), these kinds of problems were also affecting me and colleagues a lot as a user, but luckily that seems to have gotten better. Nonetheless, it would be great if QuTiP's low-level parts became even more robust.

Availability,"We can in theory drop that requirement for users - it was there in the immediate aftermath of the Numpy 1.20 release, which broke C-ABI compatibility with previous versions, and we had a couple of problems with people building against Numpy 1.20 but trying to run against a prior version. Our CI and release versions will still all need to be built against Numpy 1.16 (or our minimum supported runtime Numpy) as the lowest common denominator until we drop support for all Numpy releases before 1.20, but we enforce that in our build pipelines anyway. Just to be clear (though I think you knew this):. > Can qutip be updated to run with current versions of Numpy?. QuTiP already runs correctly against Numpy 1.20 and Numpy 1.21, and its runtime requirements on Numpy are uncapped. It's just building from source that'll fail, and that was originally a sort of ""fail-safe"" mechanism. Also `pip install -e .` should automatically do build isolation for you, including installing all the build requirements into a temporary virtual environment, so it should have just worked here. Calling `setup.py develop` directly is kind of out-dated now, though it can still be useful if you're planning on doing Cython development; `pip`'s isolation actually usually means that the Cython compiler can't detect changes any more, so it always needs to rebuild everything. `setup.py develop`, because of its much lower-level status, leaves the source and extension-library files well enough untouched that it can do incremental compilation.

Availability,"We can't implement `__hash__` for `Qobj`, sorry - it's just not possible while following the [Python data model](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__). The two principle points that a hash function must follow from there are; 1. objects which compare equal with `__eq__` have the same hash; 2. the hash of an object cannot change after instantiation (no mutable types). Unfortunately we fail on both points. `Qobj.__eq__` is a rounding match, because it gives a total `True` or `False` based on a floating point tolerance, not on exact equality. I'm not aware of any hash function which can handle this. Second, the `data` attribute of a `Qobj` is mutable in-place, and so hashing based on the data in the object is not valid. This is the same reason that `list` and `np.ndarray` are also not hashable types. If your cache is just for memoisation over a small number of `Qobj` where you know that floating-point tolerance will never be an issue, you may be able to get away with rolling your own cache decorator which uses linear lookup rather than constant-time.

Availability,"What's wrong with just using a loop? Adding the `combine` statement is already extra work for you, and using the solver in a loop will be much clearer about what's going on. The `Qobj` object container is not meant to a vector of objects itself - use a list for that, or a numpy array if you're only going to do simple mathematical operations that you want broadcasting for (numpy will broadcast `*`, `/`, `+`, `-` and `**` correctly). The calculational complexity of the solver isn't helped by knowing you're going to do it a few times, but there are some setup costs that QuTiP already gives you the tools to alleviate. `mesolve` constructs a Liouvillian out the Hamiltonian and collapse operators; if you want to reuse the result of this, you should use `qutip.liouvillian` and `qutip.QobjEvo`, and use the `compile` method of the latter. You can pass the result of this directly as the `H` parameter of `mesolve` and it'll skip all the setup. There is some work going on about making a class-based interface to the solvers, which allows easier use of the tools to reduce setup time, but those likely won't be released for some time yet. In the meantime, just use a loop here.

Availability,"Whether it is an issue likely depends on you school of thought. The error comes from the finite accuracy of the solvers. By default, the solutions are found using a method that is accurate 12-order in the step size and looks for absolute and relative errors at the 1e-8 and 1e-6 levels, respectively. If you evolve for long enough then inevitably there is going to be some error, and you will not get perfectly Hermitian matrices. One can accept this, and possibly lower the tolerance levels for more accuracy, or you can take 0.5*(A+A.dag()) to force the Hermicity. What method you use likely depends on your question and taste.

Also, as long as we have the ""TODO"" error filter turned on, it would be wrong to silence the error that comes from adding a new one, right?

Most of the tests of time-dependent formats would then occur in the QobjEvo tests. We could still test all the configurations of the solvers without too heavy a time penalty. If we only use a small number of different time-dependent operators, we can compile them all only once, and have `pytest` manage the resources through shared fixtures. That would really cut down the run times, especially for the current ""slow"" tests. Another avenue for cutting down run time is if we could merge say the MKL and OpenMP tests into one Travis job - the setup time for one job is about 2.5 minutes, and that's before any tests have run at all.

Availability,"Yeah, looking at it, this functionality still does not exist. The `essolve` function is pretty out-of-date (its last real activity was back in 2013), and may well be completely deprecated in an upcoming version of QuTiP. Hopefully `qutip.mesolve` should be a near drop-in replacement for you (`c_ops_list` is now called `c_ops`, but other than that you're fine), and it may well be a lot faster as well. @Ericgig, @ajgpitch: shall we commit to maintaining `essolve` and/or the `eseries` class, or issue a deprecation warning as soon as possible? They're pretty unloved, and `QobjEvo` really is a far far more general way of specifying time-dependence. My vote (should I have one) is for deprecation.

Availability,"Yeah, so this bug is fixed in QuTiP 4.5.3 and above. You can also fix it by downgrading Numpy to 1.19 or below (in 1.20 they changed how they handle object arrays, which broke us and a few other packages). That's strange that Conda won't let you upgrade beyond 4.5.2; there's no constraint on our conda package which should prevent it. Do you have any other packages installed that depend on QuTiP? If so, they might be pinning our version. What happens when you run `conda update qutip`?

Availability,"Yeah, that's a very fair point. If you absolutely want to do it in a sparse manner too, there's `CSR.as_scipy()` available as well that'll let you munge our data however you like. I'm still not a fan of `Qobj.__array__`, but happy enough to go with it since it seems everyone else likes it (we should also reinstate it in `dev.major`). We can set `Qobj.__array_ufunc__ = Qobj.__array_function__ = None` to disable ufuncs and other numpy functions unconditionally. It's unlikely this will annoy anyone, since we've not had a complaint that ufuncs on `Qobj` does something super weird since `Qobj.__array__` was implemented. We can leave it unless Simon wants to make some more of the case for allowing ufuncs on `Qobj`, or happy to go with this? (tag @hodgestar.).

Availability,"Yeah, that's good. There are plenty of cases (like in the tests) where we want to change something like `ntraj` on-the-fly within the same script. Even just in regular REPL work, I mess around with tolerances and things like that, and it's much much easier to be able to do that case-by-case, rather than having to set global state, which often ends up with boilerplate when you're trying to be safe - you can't do quick checks as one-liners, and you have to use `try/finally` if you only want to temporarily set it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1297#issuecomment-651144540:198,toler,tolerances,198,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1297#issuecomment-651144540,1,['toler'],['tolerances']
Availability,"Yeah, this feels like a bug in `propagator` - I bet at some point we do `qeye(L.shape[0])` instead of `qeye(L.dims[0])`. There's sometimes quite a bit of that in older code - it used to slip through because we weren't super strict about dimension handling, so in certain cases (like this one), we'd accept bad dimensions. I might try and have a look tonight (UK time), if I have time - I've wanted to break up the large `propagator` monolith into smaller components for quite a while. ---. About numerical precision: if you want to try increasing the precision of the integrators, try passing `options=qutip.Options(nsteps=1_000_000, atol=1e-12, rtol=1e-10)` to `propagator`. `atol` and `rtol` are absolute and relative tolerances respectively, and `nsteps` is the number of subdivisions the integrator is _allowed_ to take (if it reaches its tolerance goals, it won't take all of them). You'll find that `atol` and `rtol` will have only a loose relation to the tolerance of your fidelity value, because there's a _lot_ of floating-point operations between those points in which the errors compound, and there's a hard limit on the tolerances the integrator can achieve, so you might not be able to get a perfect answer. The fidelity calculation involves finding the square root of a density operator, so that's another large possible source of error. About times: if you only care about the state at the last time, setting `tlist = np.linspace(0, x, 201)` is quite inefficient. Instead, set `tlist = [0, x]`, and then pass `options=qutip.Options(nsteps=<very very big integer>)`. It's more efficient because it doesn't need to achieve tolerance goals and construct/store `Qobj` instances at every intermediate timestep. Temporary workaround: this is _very_ temporary, and generally a bad idea in QuTiP, but you can ""flatten"" all your operators into a single space for now, while we implement a fix.

Availability,"Yeah, this is a ""true"" merge of the qutip-doc repository with this one. Technically all the commits have been rewritten (you'll find that the hashes won't match between the repositories), but they'll all be credited to the same authors on GitHub. Everyone will actually get the credit ""twice"" - once for the archived qutip/qutip-doc repo, and once for the new commit object in here.

Availability,"Yeah, this is just one of those silly things caused by ImageMagick choosing a _very_ generic name and then getting burned (hence the swap to `magick`...). Probably the best thing to do is to try and run `convert` once at discovery and to see what happens. If you run `convert -version` on an IM6 install, does it output a string that looks like; > Version: ImageMagick 6.blahblahblah; or something similar?. If so, try this patch: [check_convert.txt](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/files/4397692/check_convert.txt). It rearranged the functions a little for a more logical order (I'll rebase the PR before merge), but the main change is that it now tests the output of `convert -version` to see if it contains the substring `imagemagick` (case insensitive). The reason to do this now is because if we allowed the error to propagate later, we'd have to check it every time and it would mean we'd have to pass through the ""special cases"" more frequently, and it would make the core logic more complex.

Availability,"You still wouldn't be able to put `Qobj` into numpy arrays except by doing something like; ```python; qobjs = np.empty(3, dtype=object); qobjs[:] = [qutip.qeye(2), qutip.qeye(2), qutip.qeye(2)]; ```; but probably that's not _too_ much of a big deal. Leaving QuTiP as it is right now would require that anyway. My main problem is actually just with allowing ufuncs and other numpy interfaces to act directly on `Qobj` without an explicit conversion step, because it promotes the idea that it's ok to act elementwise on a `Qobj`. I don't think we should allow ufuncs at all - `Qobj` is not meant to be like an `ndarray` and ufunc semantics don't make sense. We can set `Qobj.__array_ufunc__ = None` and `Qobj.__array_function__ = None` to disable numpy functions acting on `Qobj` directly. Example with this in place:; ```python; >>> import qutip; >>> import numpy as np; >>> np.array(qutip.qeye(2)); array([[1.+0.j, 0.+0.j],; [0.+0.j, 1.+0.j]]); >>> np.array([qutip.qeye(2), qutip.qeye(2)]) # Not ideal, but not our fault.; array([[[1.+0.j, 0.+0.j],; [0.+0.j, 1.+0.j]],.

Doing this leaves us susceptible to problems interacting with other libraries that implement this, though, beacuse whichever class has the highest `__array_priority__` gets to dictate what makes sense. Unless there's a really clear _need_ for this, I don't think it's a good idea.

For `sprepost` for rectangular operators, it's clear that the expected behavior should correspond to a supoperator taking density matrices in an input hilbert space to one in a potentially different dimensional output hilbert space. However, I think that it's not completely clear what behavior one should expect of `spre` (and `spost`) for rectangular operators. One potentially sensible behavior would be to view `spre` and `spost` as special cases of `sprepost` where one uses the identity isometry between input and output hilbert spaces to form a superoperator which will act like `sprepost(A, A.dag())`. However, I don't think such superoperators will necessarily correspond to CPTP channels as they may not admit Kraus decompositions which obey the completeness relation (I haven't actually checked this, it's just my intuition). Since it appears somewhat doubtful that anyone is currently using `spre` or `spost` with nonsquare operators, my suggestion would actually be to raise a more helpful error that acknowledges there still may be use cases for such a situation.",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2171:3718,error,error,3718,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2171,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"_**edit to put the positivity up top!**_: This is a very exciting prospect to me, and I'm always happy when other libraries want to interact with QuTiP! In the interests of inciting more discussion, I've got thrown in some more discussion points below - I'm 100% sure they're all solvable, but it also seems like there isn't one way that's unambiguously correct to do them, so they're worth discussing. ---. In principle I'm happy to implement this, though I don't really agree with your assertion that `othertype.toqobj()` is bad style! It might be so in Julia, but Python doesn't have all the same multiple-dispatch niceties that Julia has, so at the end of the day, we have to add in a method with a ""magic"" name somewhere, and it all just comes down to choosing the name of the method. The downside to having a magic name is that it means we have to eschew proper namespacing; what if another library one day wants to call their interface the same thing? Then it's completely impossible for a downstream library to interoperate with both. Having conversions be a non-special method of the downstream class, and leaving our constructor unaware of them alleviates that issue. Numpy can get away with squatting the `__array__` name because they're _huge_, but I would argue that if we do it, we could actually _harm_ the quantum software ecosystem in the long-run - what happens when a package better than QuTiP comes along that wants to call its objects `Qobj` as well? Let's face it - it's a pretty straightforward name!. All that said, I am very aware that not everyone agrees with me on this, and I _am_ a big fan of interfaces. Python doesn't give us the tools to do it properly, but we can emulate it, like you suggest. I have a few more considerations to add to a discussion:. 1. we can't have _proper_ namespacing, but let's at least make the magic name `__qutip_qobj__` so we realistically prevent any chance of a clash - by nature of a centralised package manager, we can be sure that no ot",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507:749,down,down,749,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507,6,['down'],"['down', 'downside', 'downstream']"
Availability,"_Edited 2020-08-10_. This is now a complete switch-over to the new `CSR` type, from `fast_csr_matrix`. There are huge changes and knock-on effects all across QuTiP. Most notably for user code is that arithmetic on `Qobj` is now massively faster for small `Qobj`. The instantiation cost of `Qobj` is reduced an awful lot, and internal functions which return `Qobj` now supply `dims` and `type` information to the constructor so that instantiation time is down from ~50-100µs to about ~5µs. Notable removals:; - `eseries` and `essolve` are completely gone; - OpenMP is temporarily removed (though this will be added back in to the data layer later); - all functions in `correlation` and `qobj` which were marked ""deprecated"" are now actually removed; - `vec2mat` and `mat2vec` have been renamed to `vector_to_operator` and `operator_to_vector`; - all ""legacy"" files have been completely removed; - all previous scipy-CSR-like Cython code is completely gone (replaced by the data layer); - `Qobj` no longer defines `__array__`, and so will not automatically turn itself into one. Having this produced very inconsistent behaviour when multiplying by numpy arrays, or otherwise dealing with numpy functions. If you _need_ `Qobj` to be array, be explicit and call `Qobj.full()`. Notable changes in `Qobj`:; - matrix multiplication now contracts to a scalar if doing `bra @ ket`; - matrix multiplication no longer contracts 1D subspaces, but the new `Qobj.contract()` will do this; - arithmetic operations are much more strict about enforcing `Qobj.type`-safety; - `Qobj` understands the `@` operator to mean matrix multiplication, but also maintains the same behaviour of treating `Qobj * Qobj` as matrix multiplication. Package organisation:; - the solvers are now physically contained in `qutip.solve`, but are still logically available in the `qutip` namespace. This means that direct imports (like `from qutip.mesolve import mesolve`) will fail (it becomes `from qutip.solve.mesolve import mesolve`), bu",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1332:454,down,down,454,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1332,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"` vs `v5.0` with iterative scipy solvers, especially while using `use_rcm=True`. After spending some time, I believe the main key difference between both versions comes from permutation done in the `_permute_rcm`, where indices are permuted with the indices obtained from the `reverse_cuthill_mckee` function, and this prevents us from getting the preconditioner efficiently. In `v5.0`, for permuting, we use `_data.permute.indices` for the Liouvillian matrix `L`. This gives us different results from what we used in `v4.7`, i.e.,`sp_permute` with the same permuting indices. . As per my understanding, `_data.permute.indices` performs somewhat the following - ; ``` py; A = L.copy(); A.indices = perm.take(A.indices); A = A.tocsc(A); A.indices = perm.take(A.indices); ```; where, we previously, the following was being done; ``` py; L[perm[:,None], perm]; ```; with `perm` are obtained from `reverse_cuthill_mckee`. .

But I don't like it like this, using `__call__` will raise and error if a psi is needed, and we need to treat it differently in solvers.; How about having the state inserted in the args dictionary.; So if the users have the key ""psi_vec"" or ""psi_Qobj"" in args and mul_vec (spmv)/ expect is used, it is automatically updated. With that definition most solvers could work without a special cases for `rhs_with_state=True`. The present method could still be supported using decorator.; Also it would be relatively simple to support expectation value in args in a similar way:; if a specific key/value is found in the dictonary (`args[""_expect""+name] = Qobj/ QobjEvo` ), it is replaced with the operator expectation value when possible. . For the present case, we should document it more than change it, going back to Qobj will slow the simulation. Maybe `rhs_with_state` could be more than a bool and offer the option?; Here ` expect_rho_vec(data, vec, isherm)` from qutip.expect could be used to skip the vec -> Qobj conversion. .

Availability,"`[]` is a list while 'identity' is function, so they will invoke two different type of time-dependent functions (list-string or list-function type or function callback type, respectively). `rhs_reuse` only applies to the list-string type, so it should only affect the first type of call to `mesolve`. It might be that we have a bug in handing of empty lists as first argument to mesolve, I will look into that. Regarding `rhs_reuse` it can behave a bit differently in a script and the notebook because a notebook is one long-running python process, so the state of `rhs_reuse` might be retained from one call to `mesolve` to another, while a script would get reset between successive calls (runs of the script). I guess this is the reason for the backtrace error you show. Note that you cannot use `rhs_reuse` with successive calls to `mesolve` if you change the function signature. If this is not the case, then it would be useful with a small minimum example (script or notebook) that reproduces the error. ps.. In your second use-case you qouted `mesolve(identity, ..)`.

Availability,"`auto-tidyup` exist to remove 0s stored in sparse matrices. `auto-tidyup` is quite messy, rounding all values under 1e-12 to 0 per default after each matrix operation can only cause problems. . As for the benchmark, why ask for dense operations to add an extra step to increase their outputs error to the same level as sparse operations so their benchmark do not look to good in comparisons. I think it is fair that the sparse operation's timing include the time needed to manage it's structure. . For auto-differentiation, if operations included are done with `Qobj`, it would have to differentiate tidy-up steps after each operation. But since the tidy-up operation does not have a clean derivative (`out[out < 1e-12] = 0`) it will make the auto-differentiation very inefficient.

The correct result of the output matrix should be $rho_i$, as the input matrix is already an eigenstate of $\hat{O}$.; The output of the measurement shoud be:; $\rho_e = |X\rangle \langle X| \otimes |X\rangle \langle X| =$ [[0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25], [0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25], [0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25], [0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25]].

Availability,"ame time different versions of the interface, however, and there’s value in doing so. > To me, this is absolutely one of the mistakes that Numpy made in their implementation, and we shouldn't be copying it. I don't know enough of the history behind numpy current api, but I see your point. however I'd like to reiterate that this is not what I am proposing. ; I think there is considerable difference between supporting arbitrary operations `new_obj = Qobj + netket_operator*5` (though if you are going to export dispatch hooks in `5.0`, this would be possible in a consistent way, I think) and `qutip.mesolve(netket_operator, ...)`. ; In the first, I do agree with your point that the nature python's `__add__/__radd__` is not commutative, leading to surprising behavior. From my point of view, no package really owns `+` so any conversion would be implicit.; But `qutip.groundstate(netket_operator)` is in itself an explicit cast. I am explicitly asking to qutip `please give me the ground state of this object`. I do expect to get a Qobj out, and qutip to make an effort converting this object to whatever format he internally wants to work with. Same goes with time evolution. . > For greater discussion, here's an alternate approach: instead of objects defining __qutip_qobj__, instead we expose an entry-point qutip.Qobj.register_conversion_function(converter, type, priority, version=None), and downstream libraries register functions rather than defining methods on their classes. I do prefer such an approach. I just did not think that was an option in QuTiP.; In fact we have redesigned NetKet to allow for something similar using multiple dispatch. (I’m not familiar with Tensorflow either.). I do agree with all your points, especially the first. As for your last point, about downstream packages having to import qutip: This is indeed a potential issue. I’ll try to investigate this: maybe there is a solution whereby a callback executed on package load can be registered with importlib?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-830113742:3628,down,downstream,3628,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-830113742,4,['down'],['downstream']

Availability,"and setup a matching integrator options. Thus only the keys used by the solver or integrator are defined in the instance. This allow adding new integrator with their own options without adding complexity to the solver options. It can be used as such:; ```; opt = SolverOptions(method='lsoda'); opt['progress_bar'] = False; opt.ode['max_order_ns'] = 10; ```; To make it work smoothly, each integrator must be associated to only one method thus `zvode` was split between `adams` and `bdf`. There is also a generic `Options` class that accept any keys used by integrator or solver and can be converted to any specific solver options:; ```; Options(futur_cupy_ode_specific_options=True) # Will work; Options(not_an_options=True) # Error; # For most solver:; __solve(..., opt=Options()); ```; Once options are associated to a solver, they are frozen:; ```; opt = SeOptions(); solver = SeSolver(..., opt); opt['...'] = ... # Ok, but solver has a copy and is unaffected.; solver.options['...'] = ... # Error; solver.options = opt; ```; This is because changing options without the solver knowing will not take effect. I removed saving / storing options for now. It was mostly used to store openmp threshold, which is not supported.; I also propose to write the stored options as python code when we restore it. (`options = eval(repr(options))`, we may have some issue with circular import if called from `__init__.py`, but we can just write the `repr` of the `dict`.). While it's working fine as is, there are few point to discuss:; - Freezing options associated to solver work fine, but I see 2 alternatives:; - Options know they are used by a solver and inform it when modified. More complex but give the image that it just work. ; - All options instance are read-only. To change a key, you create a new options. Simple for us. To modify an existing options we could make it callable: `updated_options = old_options(atol=1e-5)`.; - Passing bad options keys or wrong options types (`mesolve(..., SeOptions)`",MatchSource.ISSUE,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812:2780,Error,Error,2780,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1812,1,['Error'],['Error']

I would suggest deprecating it too and just add a new argument, `num_cpus` that is properly documented. . **To Reproduce**; ```python; a = qutip.destroy(10); H = a.dag() * a; c_ops = [a]; psi0 = qutip.coherent(10, 0.1); t_list = np.linspace(0, 25.0, 1001). # This works; result = qutip.mesolve(H, psi0, t_list, c_ops=c_ops, e_ops=[a]) . # This works and can be used to reproduce the above result. Note the kwarg is c_ops_list instead; # of c_ops as in mesolve.; U = qutip.propagator(H, t_list, c_op_list=c_ops). # This does not work as intended but it gets executed. That is because c_ops in interpreted as being part of kwargs. ; # The biggest issue is that no error is raised.; U1 = qutip.propagator(H, t_list, c_ops=c_ops); ```. **Expected behavior**; Functions in QuTiP should use the same name for the argument `c_ops`. **Your Environment**; ```; QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python; ================================; Copyright (c) QuTiP team 2011 and later.; Current admin team: Alexander Pitchford, Nathan Shammah, Shahnawaz Ahmed, Neill Lambert, Eric Giguère, Boxi Li, Jake Lishman and Simon Cross.; Board members: Daniel Burgarth, Robert Johansson, Anton F.

I believe that loading custom settings when importing qutip will be appreciated with support of both `dense` and `sparse` most researchers will have a preference depending on their domain. This also brings all settings in one place: `qutip.settings...` even if we split the code in ""core"", ""solver"", ""qip?"", etc. Lastly, creating and moving around an `Options` object is no longer needed, changing the default before using the solver has the same effect. . For developers:; Principally @jakelishman as I expect you to add settings for core. ; I went with an implementation similar to python `dataclass`. To add `core`'s settings to `qutip.settings` you would do ""; ```; from qutip.settings import QtOptionClass. @QtOptionClass(""core""); class CoreOptions:; basetype = ""Dense""; auto_tidyup = True; ...; ```; And it would create the `__init__`, `__repr__`, `save`, `load` and `reset` methods, and create the default instance as `qutip.settings.core`. All attributes that do not start with ""_"" and are one of `bool`, `str`, `int`, `float`, `complex` will be in tagged to be saved and loaded. Those are the only types available now, but other can be added if needed. In `__init__` all these + properties with a setter can be initiated as keyword arguments. '__repr__' 'print' all the saved attributes and properties.; This is for the likes of `has_openmp`, I would make it a read only property. Another way of doing this would have been to use a parent class and a ""register"" functions. I went with this one because the signature of `__init__` in help was cleaner. I have both implemented so if qip of control want to use the base without registering to `qutip.settings`, I can change the PR. (@ajgpitch, @BoxiLi ).
