Performance,"anging *all* of ``foo`` (or its base region) will; *definitely* change ``foo[i]``. This logic could be improved by using the current constraints on ``i``, at the; cost of speed. The latter case could also be improved by matching region kinds,; i.e. changing ``foo[0].a`` is unlikely to affect ``foo[i].b``, no matter what; ``i`` is. For more detail, read through ``RegionStoreManager::removeSubRegionBindings`` in; RegionStore.cpp. ObjCIvarRegions; ---------------. Objective-C instance variables require a bit of special handling. Like struct; fields, they are not base regions, and when their parent object region is; invalidated, all the instance variables must be invalidated as well. However,; they have no concrete compile-time offsets (in the modern, ""non-fragile""; runtime), and so cannot easily be represented as an offset from the start of; the object in the analyzer. Moreover, this means that invalidating a single; instance variable should *not* invalidate the rest of the object, since unlike; struct fields or array elements there is no way to perform pointer arithmetic; to access another instance variable. Consequently, although the base region of an ObjCIvarRegion is the entire; object, RegionStore offsets are computed from the start of the instance; variable. Thus it is not valid to assume that all bindings with non-symbolic; offsets start from the base region!. Region Invalidation; -------------------. Unlike binding invalidation, region invalidation occurs when the entire; contents of a region may have changed---say, because it has been passed to a; function the analyzer can model, like memcpy, or because its address has; escaped, usually as an argument to an opaque function call. In these cases we; need to throw away not just all bindings within the region itself, but within; its entire cluster, since neighboring regions may be accessed via pointer; arithmetic. Region invalidation typically does even more than this, however.

See :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-language-names-table`. 2.19 Support for Source Language Optimizations that Result in Concurrent Iteration Execution; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. A compiler can perform loop optimizations that result in the generated code; executing multiple iterations concurrently. For example, software pipelining; schedules multiple iterations in an interleaved fashion to allow the; instructions of one iteration to hide the latencies of the instructions of; another iteration. Another example is vectorization that can exploit SIMD; hardware to allow a single instruction to execute multiple iterations using; vector registers. Note that although this is similar to SIMT execution, the way a client debugger; uses the information is fundamentally different. In SIMT execution the debugger; needs to present the concurrent execution as distinct source language threads; that the user can list and switch focus between. With iteration concurrency; optimizations, such as software pipelining and vectorized SIMD, the debugger; must not present the concurrency as distinct source language threads. Instead,; it must inform the user that multiple loop iterations are executing in parallel; and allow the user to select between them. In general, SIMT execution fixes the number of concurrent executions per target; architecture thread. However, both software pipelining and SIMD vectorization; may vary the number of concurrent iterations for different loops executed by a; single source language thread. It is possible for the compiler to use both SIMT concurrency and iteration; concurrency techniques in the code of a single source language thread. Therefore, a DWARF operation is required to denote the current concurrent; iteration instance, much like ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` denotes the current; object.

The PCH; file can then be used as a prefix header with the `-include-pch`; option:. .. code-block:: bash. $ clang -cc1 -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test.s. Design Philosophy; -----------------. Precompiled headers are meant to improve overall compile times for projects, so; the design of precompiled headers is entirely driven by performance concerns.; The use case for precompiled headers is relatively simple: when there is a; common set of headers that is included in nearly every source file in the; project, we *precompile* that bundle of headers into a single precompiled; header (PCH file). Then, when compiling the source files in the project, we; load the PCH file first (as a prefix header), which acts as a stand-in for that; bundle of headers. A precompiled header implementation improves performance when:. * Loading the PCH file is significantly faster than re-parsing the bundle of; headers stored within the PCH file. Thus, a precompiled header design; attempts to minimize the cost of reading the PCH file. Ideally, this cost; should not vary with the size of the precompiled header file. * The cost of generating the PCH file initially is not so large that it; counters the per-source-file performance improvement due to eliminating the; need to parse the bundled headers in the first place. This is particularly; important on multi-core systems, because PCH file generation serializes the; build when all compilations require the PCH file to be up-to-date. Modules, as implemented in Clang, use the same mechanisms as precompiled; headers to save a serialized AST file (one per module) and use those AST; modules. From an implementation standpoint, modules are a generalization of; precompiled headers, lifting a number of restrictions placed on precompiled; headers.

If the ``load`` is marked as ``atomic``, it takes an extra :ref:`ordering; <ordering>` and optional ``syncscope(""<target-scope>"")`` argument. The; ``release`` and ``acq_rel`` orderings are not valid on ``load`` instructions.; Atomic loads produce :ref:`defined <memmodel>` results when they may see; multiple atomic stores. The type of the pointee must be an integer, pointer, or; floating-point type whose bit width is a power of two greater than or equal to; eight and less than or equal to a target-specific size limit. ``align`` must be; explicitly specified on atomic loads.

Similar; method exists for other ABI-affecting attributes that need to know the; element type, such as byref, sret, inalloca and preallocated.; * Some intrinsics require an ``elementtype`` attribute, which can be retrieved; using ``getParamElementType()``. This attribute is required in cases where; the intrinsic does not naturally encode a needed element type. This is also; used for inline assembly. Note that some of the methods mentioned above only exist to support both typed; and opaque pointers at the same time, and will be dropped once the migration; has completed. For example, ``isOpaqueOrPointeeTypeEquals()`` becomes; meaningless once all pointers are opaque. While direct usage of pointer element types is immediately apparent in code,; there is a more subtle issue that opaque pointers need to contend with: A lot; of code assumes that pointer equality also implies that the used load/store; type or GEP source element type is the same. Consider the following examples; with typed and opaque pointers:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @test(i32* %p) {; store i32 0, i32* %p; %bc = bitcast i32* %p to i64*; %v = load i64, i64* %bc; ret i64 %v; }. define i32 @test(ptr %p) {; store i32 0, ptr %p; %v = load i64, ptr %p; ret i64 %v; }. Without opaque pointers, a check that the pointer operand of the load and; store are the same also ensures that the accessed type is the same. Using a; different type requires a bitcast, which will result in distinct pointer; operands. With opaque pointers, the bitcast is not present, and this check is no longer; sufficient. In the above example, it could result in store to load forwarding; of an incorrect type.

Performance,"arameter Estimation #. After going through the previous chapters, you already know how to use; analytical functions (class `TF1`), and you got some insight into the; graph (`TGraphErrors`) and histogram classes (`TH1F`) for data; visualisation. In this chapter we will add more detail to the previous; approximate explanations to face the fundamental topic of parameter; estimation by fitting functions to data. For graphs and histograms, ROOT; offers an easy-to-use interface to perform fits - either the fit panel; of the graphical interface, or the `Fit` method. The class `TFitResult`; allows access to the detailed results. Very often it is necessary to study the statistical properties of; analysis procedures. This is most easily achieved by applying the; analysis to many sets of simulated data (or ""pseudo data""), each; representing one possible version of the true experiment. If the; simulation only deals with the final distributions observed in data, and; does not perform a full simulation of the underlying physics and the; experimental apparatus, the name ""Toy Monte Carlo"" is frequently used; [^5]. Since the true values of all parameters are known in the; pseudo-data, the differences between the parameter estimates from the; analysis procedure w.r.t. the true values can be determined, and it is; also possible to check that the analysis procedure provides correct; error estimates. ## Fitting Functions to Pseudo Data ##. In the example below, a pseudo-data set is produced and a model fitted; to it. ROOT offers various minimisation algorithms to minimise a chi2 or a; negative log-likelihood function.

RooDataHist was partially modernised to improve const-correctness, to reduce side effects as well as its memory footprint, and to make; it ready for RooFit's faster batch evaluations.; Derived classes that directly access protected members might need to be updated. This holds especially for direct accesses to `_curWeight`,; `_curWeightErrLo`, etc, which have been removed. (It doesn't make sense to write to these members from const functions when the same information; can be retrieved using an index access operator of an array.) All similar accesses in derived classes should be replaced by the getters `get_curWeight()`; or better `get_wgt(i)`, which were also supported in ROOT \<v6.24. More details on what happened:. - Reduced side effects. This code produces undefined behaviour because the side effect of `get(i)`, i.e., loading the new weight into `_curWeight`; is not guaranteed to happen before `weight()` is called:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight()); // Dangerous! Order of evaluation is not guaranteed.; ```; With the modernised interface, one would use:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight(i));; ```; To modernise old code, one should replace patterns like `h.get(i); h.func()` by `h.func(i);`. One may `#define R__SUGGEST_NEW_INTERFACE` to switch on; deprecation warnings for the functions in question.; Similarly, the bin content can now be set using an index, making prior loading of a certain coordinate unnecessary:; ```; for (int i=0 ; i<hist->numEntries() ; i++) {; - hist->get(i) ;; - hist->set(hist->weight() / sum);; + hist->set(i, hist->weight(i) / sum, 0.);; }; ```; - More const correctness. `calcTreeIndex()` doesn't rely on side effects, any more.

In; addition, a lookup table provides a mapping from that numeric ID to the offset; within the precompiled header where that declaration is described. Declarations in Clang's abstract syntax trees are stored hierarchically. At; the top of the hierarchy is the translation unit (``TranslationUnitDecl``),; which contains all of the declarations in the translation unit but is not; actually written as a specific declaration node. Its child declarations (such; as functions or struct types) may also contain other declarations inside them,; and so on. Within Clang, each declaration is stored within a :ref:`declaration; context <DeclContext>`, as represented by the ``DeclContext`` class.; Declaration contexts provide the mechanism to perform name lookup within a; given declaration (e.g., find the member named ``x`` in a structure) and; iterate over the declarations stored within a context (e.g., iterate over all; of the fields of a structure for structure layout).

We copy the code from the original to the instrumentation version; by tracing the LLVM-to-Machine code basic block map and then copying; each machine code basic block we think is in the hot region into the; trace cache. Then we instrument that code. The process is similar for; generating the final optimized trace; we copy the same basic blocks; because we might need to put in fixup code for exit BBs. LLVM basic blocks are not typically used in the Reoptimizer except; for the mapping information. We are restricted to using single instructions to branch between the; original code, trace, and instrumented code. So we have to keep the; code copies in memory near the original code (they can't be far enough; away that a single pc-relative branch would not work.) Malloc() or; data region space is too far away. this impacts the design of the ; trace cache. We use a dummy function that is full of a bunch of for loops which we; overwrite with trace-cache code. The trace manager keeps track of; whether or not we have enough space in the trace cache, etc. The trace insertion routine takes an original start address, a vector; of machine instructions representing the trace, index of branches and; their corresponding absolute targets, and index of calls and their; corresponding absolute targets. The trace insertion routine is responsible for inserting branches from; the beginning of the original code to the beginning of the optimized; trace. This is because at some point the trace cache may run out of; space and it may have to evict a trace, at which point the branch to; the trace would also have to be removed.

Performance,"ariant Code Motion; ------------------------------------. This pass performs loop invariant code motion, attempting to remove as much; code from the body of a loop as possible. It does this by either hoisting code; into the preheader block, or by sinking code to the exit blocks if it is safe.; This pass also promotes must-aliased memory locations in the loop to live in; registers, thus hoisting and sinking ""invariant"" loads and stores. Hoisting operations out of loops is a canonicalization transform. It enables; and simplifies subsequent optimizations in the middle-end. Rematerialization; of hoisted instructions to reduce register pressure is the responsibility of; the back-end, which has more accurate information about register pressure and; also handles other optimizations than LICM that increase live-ranges. This pass uses alias analysis for two purposes:. #. Moving loop invariant loads and calls out of loops. If we can determine; that a load or call inside of a loop never aliases anything stored to, we; can hoist it or sink it like any other instruction. #. Scalar Promotion of Memory. If there is a store instruction inside of the; loop, we try to move the store to happen AFTER the loop instead of inside of; the loop. This can only happen if a few conditions are true:. #. The pointer stored through is loop invariant.; #. There are no stores or loads in the loop which *may* alias the pointer.; There are no calls in the loop which mod/ref the pointer.

Performance,"aries and headers on which it depends. The section `Modularizing a Platform`_ describes the steps one must take to write these module maps. One can use module maps without modules to check the integrity of the use of header files. To do this, use the ``-fimplicit-module-maps`` option instead of the ``-fmodules`` option, or use ``-fmodule-map-file=`` option to explicitly specify the module map files to load. Compilation model; -----------------; The binary representation of modules is automatically generated by the compiler on an as-needed basis. When a module is imported (e.g., by an ``#include`` of one of the module's headers), the compiler will spawn a second instance of itself [#]_, with a fresh preprocessing context [#]_, to parse just the headers in that module. The resulting Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is then persisted into the binary representation of the module that is then loaded into translation unit where the module import was encountered. The binary representation of modules is persisted in the *module cache*. Imports of a module will first query the module cache and, if a binary representation of the required module is already available, will load that representation directly. Thus, a module's headers will only be parsed once per language configuration, rather than once per translation unit that uses the module. Modules maintain references to each of the headers that were part of the module build. If any of those headers changes, or if any of the modules on which a module depends change, then the module will be (automatically) recompiled. The process should never require any user intervention.

Performance,"arly, the annotation may apply to type of a function; parameter declaration which precedes the parameter count in the same function.; This means parsing the argument of bounds annotations must be done after the; parser has the whole context of a struct or a function declaration. Clang has; late parsing logic for C++ declaration attributes that require late parsing,; while the C declaration attributes and C/C++ type attributes do not have the; same logic. This requires introducing late parsing logic for C/C++ type; attributes. Internal bounds annotations; ===========================. ``__indexable`` and ``__bidi_indexable`` alter pointer representations to be; equivalent to a struct with the pointer and the corresponding bounds fields.; Despite this difference in their representations, they are still pointers in; terms of types of operations that are allowed and their semantics. For instance,; a pointer dereference on a ``__bidi_indexable`` pointer will return the; dereferenced value same as plain C pointers, modulo the extra bounds checks; being performed before dereferencing the wide pointer. This means mapping the; wide pointers to struct types with equivalent layout won’t be sufficient. To; represent the wide pointers in Clang AST, we add an extra field in the; PointerType class to indicate the internal bounds of the pointer. This ensures; pointers of different representations are mapped to different canonical types; while they are still treated as pointers. In LLVM IR, wide pointers will be emitted as structs of equivalent; representations. Clang CodeGen will handle them as Aggregate in; ``TypeEvaluationKind (TEK)``. ``AggExprEmitter`` was extended to handle pointer; operations returning wide pointers.

Certain memory accesses, such as :ref:`load <i_load>`'s,; :ref:`store <i_store>`'s, and :ref:`llvm.memcpy <int_memcpy>`'s may be; marked ``volatile``. The optimizers must not change the number of; volatile operations or change their order of execution relative to other; volatile operations. The optimizers *may* change the order of volatile; operations relative to non-volatile operations. This is not Java's; ""volatile"" and has no cross-thread synchronization behavior. A volatile load or store may have additional target-specific semantics.; Any volatile operation can have side effects, and any volatile operation; can read and/or modify state which is not accessible via a regular load; or store in this module. Volatile operations may use addresses which do; not point to memory (like MMIO registers). This means the compiler may; not use a volatile operation to prove a non-volatile access to that; address has defined behavior. The allowed side-effects for volatile accesses are limited. If a; non-volatile store to a given address would be legal, a volatile; operation may modify the memory at that address. A volatile operation; may not modify any other memory accessible by the module being compiled.; A volatile operation may not call any code in the current module. In general (without target specific context), the address space of a; volatile operation may not be changed.

Performance,"art of clang as part of a continuous integration; framework, ensuring updates to the compiler that reduce CFI coverage on; indirect control flow instructions are identified. Background; ==========. This tool will continuously validate that CFI directives are properly; implemented around all indirect control flows by analysing the output machine; code. The analysis of machine code is important as it ensures that any bugs; present in linker or compiler do not subvert CFI protections in the final; shipped binary. Unprotected indirect control flow instructions will be flagged for manual; review. These unexpected control flows may simply have not been accounted for in; the compiler implementation of CFI (e.g. indirect jumps to facilitate switch; statements may not be fully protected). It may be possible in the future to extend this tool to flag unnecessary CFI; directives (e.g. CFI directives around a static call to a non-polymorphic base; type). This type of directive has no security implications, but may present; performance impacts. Design Ideas; ============. This tool will disassemble binaries and DSO's from their machine code format and; analyse the disassembled machine code. The tool will inspect virtual calls and; indirect function calls. This tool will also inspect indirect jumps, as inlined; functions and jump tables should also be subject to CFI protections. Non-virtual; calls (``-fsanitize=cfi-nvcall``) and cast checks (``-fsanitize=cfi-*cast*``); are not implemented due to a lack of information provided by the bytecode. The tool would operate by searching for indirect control flow instructions in; the disassembly. A control flow graph would be generated from a small buffer of; the instructions surrounding the 'target' control flow instruction.

Performance,"as if each submodule were a separate translation unit, and a module import makes names from the other translation unit visible. Each submodule starts with a new preprocessor state and an empty translation unit. .. note::. This behavior is currently only approximated when building a module with submodules. Entities within a submodule that has already been built are visible when building later submodules in that module. This can lead to fragile modules that depend on the build order used for the submodules of the module, and should not be relied upon. This behavior is subject to change. As an example, in C, this implies that if two structs are defined in different submodules with the same name, those two types are distinct types (but may be *compatible* types if their definitions match). In C++, two structs defined with the same name in different submodules are the *same* type, and must be equivalent under C++'s One Definition Rule. .. note::. Clang currently only performs minimal checking for violations of the One Definition Rule. If any submodule of a module is imported into any part of a program, the entire top-level module is considered to be part of the program. As a consequence of this, Clang may diagnose conflicts between an entity declared in an unimported submodule and an entity declared in the current translation unit, and Clang may inline or devirtualize based on knowledge from unimported submodules. Macros; ------. The C and C++ preprocessor assumes that the input text is a single linear buffer, but with modules this is not the case. It is possible to import two modules that have conflicting definitions for a macro (or where one ``#define``\s a macro and the other ``#undef``\ines it).

Most; of GEP's special aliasing rules do not apply to pointers computed from ptrtoint,; arithmetic, and inttoptr sequences. Can I compute the distance between two objects, and add that value to one address to compute the other address?; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. As with arithmetic on null, you can use GEP to compute an address that way, but; you can't use that pointer to actually access the object if you do, unless the; object is managed outside of LLVM. Also as above, ptrtoint and inttoptr provide an alternative way to do this which; do not have this restriction. Can I do type-based alias analysis on LLVM IR?; ----------------------------------------------. You can't do type-based alias analysis using LLVM's built-in type system,; because LLVM has no restrictions on mixing types in addressing, loads or stores. LLVM's type-based alias analysis pass uses metadata to describe a different type; system (such as the C type system), and performs type-based aliasing on top of; that. Further details are in the; `language reference <LangRef.html#tbaa-metadata>`_. What happens if a GEP computation overflows?; --------------------------------------------. If the GEP lacks the ``inbounds`` keyword, the value is the result from; evaluating the implied two's complement integer computation. However, since; there's no guarantee of where an object will be allocated in the address space,; such values have limited meaning. If the GEP has the ``inbounds`` keyword, the result value is ``poison``; if the GEP overflows (i.e. wraps around the end of the address space).

A `TFile` does not take ownership of any `RNTuple` objects. When reading data, RNTuple uses the `RMiniFile` and `RRawFile` classes to open a given storage path and find the `RNTuple` anchor.; When creating a `RNTupleReader` from an existing anchor object, RNTuple uses `RRawFile` only for files of dynamic type `TFile`, `TDavixFile`, and `TNetXNGFile`.; In either case, the `RRawFile` owns its own file descriptor and does not interfere with `TFile` objects concurrently reading the file.; For anchors from files of other dynamic type, including all other `TFile` subclasses, the file is wrapped in a `RRawFileTFile` and access is shared.

In other word, the lock is re-entrant for both reading and writing. The implementation tries to make faster the scenario when readers come and go but there is no writer. In that case, readers will not pay the price of taking the internal lock.; Moreover, this RW lock tries to be fair with writers, giving them the possibility to claim the lock and wait for only the remaining readers, thus preventing starvation. - Switched the ROOT global to be a ```ROOT::TReentrantRWLock``` and renamed it ROOT::gCoreMutex.

It differs from regular operations comparison with the only thing: possibility; to use ``accumulateConstantOffset`` method. So, if we get constant offset for both left and right *GEPs*, then compare it as; numbers, and return comparison result. Otherwise treat it like a regular operation (see previous paragraph). cmpOperation; ------------; Compares instruction opcodes and some important operation properties. 1. Compare opcodes, if it differs return the result. 2. Compare number of operands. If it differs – return the result. 3. Compare operation types, use *cmpType*. All the same – if types are; different, return result. 4. Compare *subclassOptionalData*, get it with ``getRawSubclassOptionalData``; method, and compare it like a numbers. 5. Compare operand types. 6. For some particular instructions, check equivalence (relation in our case) of; some significant attributes. For example, we have to compare alignment for; ``load`` instructions. O(log(N)); ---------; Methods described above implement order relationship.

Because the Hello pass does not modify; the program in any interesting way, we just throw away the result of; :program:`opt` (sending it to ``/dev/null``).

Performance,"assStreamer` bit is set, the automatically generated; `Streamer `can call directly the method **`TClass::WriteBuffer`**.; Bypassing the `Streamer` improves the performance when writing/reading; the objects in the **`TClonesArray`**. However, the drawback is when a; **`TClonesArray`** is written with `split=0` bypassing the `Streamer`,; the `StreamerInfo `of the class in the array being optimized, one cannot; later use the **`TClonesArray`** with `split > 0`. For example, there is; a problem with the following scenario: a class `Foo` has a; **`TClonesArray`** of `Bar` objects the `Foo` object is written with; `split=0` to `Tree` `T1`. In this case the `StreamerInfo` for the class; `Bar` is created in optimized mode in such a way that data members of; the same type are written as an array improving the I/O performance. In; a new program, `T1` is read and a new `Tree` `T2` is created with the; object `Foo` in `split > 1`. When the `T2 `branch is created, the `StreamerInfo` for the class `Bar`; is created with no optimization (mandatory for the split mode). The; optimized Bar `StreamerInfo` is going to be used to read the; **`TClonesArray`** in `T1`. The result will be `Bar` objects with data; member values not in the right sequence. The solution to this problem is; to call `BypassStreamer(kFALSE)` for the **`TClonesArray`**. In this; case, the normal `Bar::Streamer` function will be called. The; `Bar::Streamer` function works OK independently if the `Bar`; `StreamerInfo `had been generated in optimized mode or not. ## Pointers and References in Persistency. An object pointer as a data member presents a challenge to the streaming; software. If the object pointed to is saved every time, it could create; circular dependencies and consume a large amount of disk space.

The performance of `PyROOT` when programming with ROOT in Python is; similar to that of Cling. Differences occur mainly because of differences; in the respective languages: C++ is much harder to parse, but once; parsed, it is much easier to optimize. Consequently, individual calls to; ROOT are typically faster from `PyROOT`, whereas loops are typically; slower. When programming in Python, the modus operandi is to consider; performance generally ""good enough"" on the outset, and when it turns out; that, it is not good enough; the performance critical part is converted; into C/C++ in an extension module. The school of thought where; pre-mature optimization is the root of all evil should find this way of; working very satisfying. In addition, if you look at their history, you; will see that many of the standard Python modules have followed this; path. Your code should always make maximum use of ROOT facilities; such that; most of the time is spending in compiled code. This goes even for very; simple things: e.g. do not compute invariant masses in Python, use; **`TLorentzVector`** instead. Moreover, before you start optimizing,; make sure that you have run a profiler to find out where the bottlenecks; are. Some performance, without cost in terms of programmer effort, may; be gained by using `psyco`, see the next link:; <http://psyco.sourceforge.net>, a Python just in time compiler (JIT).; Note, however, that `psyco` is limited to Intel i386 CPUs.

If the operand bundle value violates any requirements on the attribute value,; the behavior is undefined, unless one of the following exceptions applies:. * ``""align""`` operand bundles may specify a non-power-of-two alignment; (including a zero alignment). If this is the case, then the pointer value; must be a null pointer, otherwise the behavior is undefined. In addition to allowing operand bundles encoding function and parameter; attributes, an assume operand bundle my also encode a ``separate_storage``; operand bundle. This has the form:. .. code-block:: llvm. separate_storage(<val1>, <val2>)``. This indicates that no pointer :ref:`based <pointeraliasing>` on one of its; arguments can alias any pointer based on the other. Even if the assumed property can be encoded as a boolean value, like; ``nonnull``, using operand bundles to express the property can still have; benefits:. * Attributes that can be expressed via operand bundles are directly the; property that the optimizer uses and cares about. Encoding attributes as; operand bundles removes the need for an instruction sequence that represents; the property (e.g., `icmp ne ptr %p, null` for `nonnull`) and for the; optimizer to deduce the property from that instruction sequence.; * Expressing the property using operand bundles makes it easy to identify the; use of the value as a use in an :ref:`llvm.assume <int_assume>`.

The remainder of this section describes exceptions to these rules, how those; exceptions are detected, and what those exceptions imply semantically. .. _arc.objects.operands.consumed:. Consumed parameters; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A function or method parameter of retainable object pointer type may be marked; as :arc-term:`consumed`, signifying that the callee expects to take ownership; of a +1 retain count. This is done by adding the ``ns_consumed`` attribute to; the parameter declaration, like so:. .. code-block:: objc. void foo(__attribute((ns_consumed)) id x);; - (void) foo: (id) __attribute((ns_consumed)) x;. This attribute is part of the type of the function or method, not the type of; the parameter. It controls only how the argument is passed and received. When passing such an argument, ARC retains the argument prior to making the; call. When receiving such an argument, ARC releases the argument at the end of the; function, subject to the usual optimizations for local values. .. admonition:: Rationale. This formalizes direct transfers of ownership from a caller to a callee. The; most common scenario here is passing the ``self`` parameter to ``init``, but; it is useful to generalize. Typically, local optimization will remove any; extra retains and releases: on the caller side the retain will be merged with; a +1 source, and on the callee side the release will be rolled into the; initialization of the parameter. The implicit ``self`` parameter of a method may be marked as consumed by adding; ``__attribute__((ns_consumes_self))`` to the method declaration. Methods in; the ``init`` :ref:`family <arc.method-families>` are treated as if they were; implicitly marked with this attribute.

Why Numba?; ----------. The advertised premise of Numba is that it ""makes Python code fast.""; However, there is a much more compelling reason: Numba allows developers to; stay in their chosen ecosystem, be it Python or C++, in mixed environments,; without paying for their choice in lost performance.; For example, a Python developer using Numba does not need to rewrite a kernel; into C++ just to run performantly in a C++ framework.; Similarly, a C++ developer can use Numba to compile and create function; pointers to Python code for easy, performant, access.; This becomes even more compelling if the deployment target is a GPU, which; would otherwise certainly require a rewrite of the Python code.; Add that Numba, as a JIT-compiler, is fully run-time just like ``cppyy``,; and the use case for integration is clear.; (Numba does not currently provide support for C++.). Usage; -------. ``cppyy`` does not use Numba extension hooks to minimize accidental; dependencies.; Instead, it requires that the extensions are loaded explicitly by any code; that uses it::. import cppyy.numba_ext.

Performance,"at uses the core LLVM library for optimization and code; generation. The exact syntax for invoking the option is discussed below. This feature is not intended to replace other debugging tools such as bugpoint.; Rather it provides an alternate course of action when reproducing the problem; requires a complex build infrastructure that would make using bugpoint; impractical or when reproducing the failure requires a sequence of; transformations that is difficult to replicate with tools like opt and llc. Getting Started; ===============. The -opt-bisect-limit command line option can be passed directly to tools such; as opt, llc and lli. The syntax is as follows:. ::. <tool name> [other options] -opt-bisect-limit=<limit>. If a value of -1 is used the tool will perform all optimizations but a message; will be printed to stderr for each optimization that could be skipped; indicating the index value that is associated with that optimization. To skip; optimizations, pass the value of the last optimization to be performed as the; opt-bisect-limit. All optimizations with a higher index value will be skipped. In order to use the -opt-bisect-limit option with a driver that provides a; wrapper around the LLVM core library, an additional prefix option may be; required, as defined by the driver. For example, to use this option with; clang, the ""-mllvm"" prefix must be used. A typical clang invocation would look; like this:. ::. clang -O2 -mllvm -opt-bisect-limit=256 my_file.c. The -opt-bisect-limit option may also be applied to link-time optimizations by; using a prefix to indicate that this is a plug-in option for the linker.

RooFit will; now automatically generate binned pdf shapes. Binned pdfs shapes are fundamentally RooHistPdf and RooHistFuncs; (with interpolation order set to zero).

For such binned shapes generate() will now by default follow the 'binned' strategy ; -- that is, take the expectation value in each bin and sample a Poisson distribution from that -- rather; than follow the unbinned strategy. The rationale is that such datasets result in much faster likelihood; calculations (for nbin smaller than nevent). The optimization is also exact: the likelihood of a binned ; data using a binned pdf is identical to that of an unbinned dataset with a binned pdf. Nevertheless you can ; switch off this feature by passing AutoBinned(false) to RooAbsPdf::generate(). Mixed binned/unbinned generation from simultaneous pdf.

From an implementation standpoint, modules are a generalization of; precompiled headers, lifting a number of restrictions placed on precompiled; headers. In particular, there can only be one precompiled header and it must; be included at the beginning of the translation unit. The extensions to the; AST file format required for modules are discussed in the section on; :ref:`modules <pchinternals-modules>`. Clang's AST files are designed with a compact on-disk representation, which; minimizes both creation time and the time required to initially load the AST; file. The AST file itself contains a serialized representation of Clang's; abstract syntax trees and supporting data structures, stored using the same; compressed bitstream as `LLVM's bitcode file format; <https://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html>`_. Clang's AST files are loaded ""lazily"" from disk. When an AST file is initially; loaded, Clang reads only a small amount of data from the AST file to establish; where certain important data structures are stored. The amount of data read in; this initial load is independent of the size of the AST file, such that a; larger AST file does not lead to longer AST load times. The actual header data; in the AST file --- macros, functions, variables, types, etc. --- is loaded; only when it is referenced from the user's code, at which point only that; entity (and those entities it depends on) are deserialized from the AST file.; With this approach, the cost of using an AST file for a translation unit is; proportional to the amount of code actually used from the AST file, rather than; being proportional to the size of the AST file itself. When given the `-print-stats` option, Clang produces statistics; describing how much of the AST file was actually loaded from disk.

An alternative would be to re-use ASAN's attribute; `sanitize_address`. The reasons to use a separate attribute are:. * Users may need to disable ASAN but not HWASAN, or vise versa,; because the tools have different trade-offs and compatibility issues.; * LLVM (ideally) does not use flags to decide which pass is being used,; ASAN or HWASAN are being applied, based on the function attributes. This does mean that users of HWASAN may need to add the new attribute; to the code that already uses the old attribute. Comparison with AddressSanitizer; ================================. HWASAN:; * Is less portable than :doc:`AddressSanitizer`; as it relies on hardware `Address Tagging`_ (AArch64).; Address Tagging can be emulated with compiler instrumentation,; but it will require the instrumentation to remove the tags before; any load or store, which is infeasible in any realistic environment; that contains non-instrumented code.; * May have compatibility problems if the target code uses higher; pointer bits for other purposes.; * May require changes in the OS kernels (e.g. Linux seems to dislike; tagged pointers passed from address space:; https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/arm64/tagged-pointers.txt).; * **Does not require redzones to detect buffer overflows**,; but the buffer overflow detection is probabilistic, with roughly; `1/(2**TS)` chance of missing a bug (6.25% or 0.39% with 4 and 8-bit TS; respectively).; * **Does not require quarantine to detect heap-use-after-free,; or stack-use-after-return**.; The detection is similarly probabilistic.

IPC is computed dividing the total number of simulated instructions by the total; number of cycles. Field *Block RThroughput* is the reciprocal of the block throughput. Block; throughput is a theoretical quantity computed as the maximum number of blocks; (i.e. iterations) that can be executed per simulated clock cycle in the absence; of loop carried dependencies. Block throughput is superiorly limited by the; dispatch rate, and the availability of hardware resources. In the absence of loop-carried data dependencies, the observed IPC tends to a; theoretical maximum which can be computed by dividing the number of instructions; of a single iteration by the `Block RThroughput`. Field 'uOps Per Cycle' is computed dividing the total number of simulated micro; opcodes by the total number of cycles. A delta between Dispatch Width and this; field is an indicator of a performance issue. In the absence of loop-carried; data dependencies, the observed 'uOps Per Cycle' should tend to a theoretical; maximum throughput which can be computed by dividing the number of uOps of a; single iteration by the `Block RThroughput`. Field *uOps Per Cycle* is bounded from above by the dispatch width. That is; because the dispatch width limits the maximum size of a dispatch group. Both IPC; and 'uOps Per Cycle' are limited by the amount of hardware parallelism. The; availability of hardware resources affects the resource pressure distribution,; and it limits the number of instructions that can be executed in parallel every; cycle. A delta between Dispatch Width and the theoretical maximum uOps per; Cycle (computed by dividing the number of uOps of a single iteration by the; `Block RThroughput`) is an indicator of a performance bottleneck caused by the; lack of hardware resources.; In general, the lower the Block RThroughput, the better.

The most obvious implementation uses either an `and` instruction with; an all-zero mask along misspeculated paths and an all-one mask along correct; paths, or an `or` instruction with an all-one mask along misspeculated paths; and an all-zero mask along correct paths. Other options become less appealing; such as multiplying by zero, or multiple shift instructions.

Other useful patterns may be to fold the load into the `or` instruction itself; at the cost of a register-to-register copy. There are some challenges with deploying this approach:; 1. Many loads on x86 are folded into other instructions. Separating them would; add very significant and costly register pressure with prohibitive; performance cost.; 1. Loads may not target a general purpose register requiring extra instructions; to map the state value into the correct register class, and potentially more; expensive instructions to mask the value in some way.; 1. The flags registers on x86 are very likely to be live, and challenging to; preserve cheaply.; 1. There are many more values loaded than pointers & indices used for loads. As; a consequence, hardening the result of a load requires substantially more; instructions than hardening the address of the load (see below).

Table *Average Wait times* helps diagnose performance issues that are caused by; the presence of long latency instructions and potentially long data dependencies; which may limit the ILP. Last row, ``<total>``, shows a global average over all; instructions measured. Note that :program:`llvm-mca`, by default, assumes at; least 1cy between the dispatch event and the issue event. When the performance is limited by data dependencies and/or long latency; instructions, the number of cycles spent while in the *ready* state is expected; to be very small when compared with the total number of cycles spent in the; scheduler's queue. The difference between the two counters is a good indicator; of how large of an impact data dependencies had on the execution of the; instructions. When performance is mostly limited by the lack of hardware; resources, the delta between the two counters is small. However, the number of; cycles spent in the queue tends to be larger (i.e., more than 1-3cy),; especially when compared to other low latency instructions.

This allows all DWARF Version 5 expressions to retain their same meaning,; while enabling the ability to explicitly create memory location descriptions in; non-default address spaces and generalizing the power of composite location; descriptions to any kind of location description. For those familiar with the definition of location descriptions in DWARF Version; 5, the definitions in these extensions are presented differently, but does in; fact define the same concept with the same fundamental semantics. However, it; does so in a way that allows the concept to extend to support address spaces,; bit addressing, the ability for composite location descriptions to be composed; of any kind of location description, and the ability to support objects located; at multiple places. Collectively these changes expand the set of architectures; that can be supported and improves support for optimized code.

Examining the GDB debugger and LLVM compiler, it appears only; to require modest changes as they both already have to support general use of; location descriptions. It is anticipated that will also be the case for other; debuggers and compilers. GDB has been modified to evaluate DWARF Version 5 expressions with location; descriptions as stack entries and with implicit conversions.

However, we won't discuss those; variations here.). To make a conclusion about all paths through the program, we repeat this; computation on all basic blocks until we reach a fixpoint. In other words, we; keep propagating information through the CFG until the computed sets of values; stop changing. If the lattice has a finite height and transfer functions are monotonic the; algorithm is guaranteed to terminate. Each iteration of the algorithm can; change computed values only to larger values from the lattice. In the worst; case, all computed values become `⊤`, which is not very useful, but at least the; analysis terminates at that point, because it can't change any of the values. Fixpoint iteration can be optimised by only reprocessing basic blocks which had; one of their inputs changed on the previous iteration. This is typically; implemented using a worklist queue. With this optimisation the time complexity; becomes `O(m * |L|)`, where `m` is the number of basic blocks in the CFG and; `|L|` is the size of lattice used by the analysis. ## Symbolic execution: a very short informal introduction. ### Symbolic values. In the previous example where we tried to figure out what values a variable can; have, the analysis had to be seeded with a concrete value.

Performance,"ation, we switch; representations to an explicit form. The exact location chosen for lowering; is an implementation detail. Note that most of the value of the abstract machine model comes for collectors; which need to model potentially relocatable objects. For a compiler which; supports only a non-relocating collector, you may wish to consider starting; with the fully explicit form. Warning: There is one currently known semantic hole in the definition of; non-integral pointers which has not been addressed upstream. To work around; this, you need to disable speculation of loads unless the memory type; (non-integral pointer vs anything else) is known to unchanged. That is, it is; not safe to speculate a load if doing causes a non-integral pointer value to; be loaded as any other type or vice versa. In practice, this restriction is; well isolated to isSafeToSpeculate in ValueTracking.cpp. Explicit Representation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A frontend could directly generate this low level explicit form, but; doing so may inhibit optimization. Instead, it is recommended that; compilers with relocating collectors target the abstract machine model just; described. The heart of the explicit approach is to construct (or rewrite) the IR in a; manner where the possible updates performed by the garbage collector are; explicitly visible in the IR. Doing so requires that we:. #. create a new SSA value for each potentially relocated pointer, and; ensure that no uses of the original (non relocated) value is; reachable after the safepoint,; #. specify the relocation in a way which is opaque to the compiler to; ensure that the optimizer can not introduce new uses of an; unrelocated value after a statepoint.

If the load may trigger an exception, hoisting it; above a stack map could be invalid. For example, the runtime may; determine that a load is safe to execute without a type check given; the current state of the type system. If the type system changes while; some activation of the load's function exists on the stack, the load; becomes unsafe. The runtime can prevent subsequent execution of that; load by immediately patching any stack map location that lies between; the current call site and the load (typically, the runtime would; simply patch all stack map locations to invalidate the function). If; the compiler had hoisted the load above the stack map, then the; program could crash before the runtime could take back control. To enforce these semantics, stackmap and patchpoint intrinsics are; considered to potentially read and write all memory. This may limit; optimization more than some clients desire. This limitation may be; avoided by marking the call site as ""readonly"". In the future we may; also allow meta-data to be added to the intrinsic call to express; aliasing, thereby allowing optimizations to hoist certain loads above; stack maps.

Phase 4 : Symbol Resolution after optimization; ----------------------------------------------. In this phase, the linker reads optimized a native object file and updates the; internal global symbol table to reflect any changes. The linker also collects; information about any changes in use of external symbols by LLVM bitcode; files. In the example above, the linker notes that ``foo4()`` is not used any; more. If dead code stripping is enabled then the linker refreshes the live; symbol information appropriately and performs dead code stripping. After this phase, the linker continues linking as if it never saw LLVM bitcode; files. .. _libLTO:. ``libLTO``; ==========. ``libLTO`` is a shared object that is part of the LLVM tools, and is intended; for use by a linker. ``libLTO`` provides an abstract C interface to use the LLVM; interprocedural optimizer without exposing details of LLVM's internals. The; intention is to keep the interface as stable as possible even when the LLVM; optimizer continues to evolve. It should even be possible for a completely; different compilation technology to provide a different libLTO that works with; their object files and the standard linker tool. ``lto_module_t``; ----------------. A non-native object file is handled via an ``lto_module_t``. The following; functions allow the linker to check if a file (on disk or in a memory buffer) is; a file which libLTO can process:. .. code-block:: c. lto_module_is_object_file(const char*); lto_module_is_object_file_for_target(const char*, const char*); lto_module_is_object_file_in_memory(const void*, size_t); lto_module_is_object_file_in_memory_for_target(const void*, size_t, const char*).

Performance,"atory for atomic loads and stores. Other Things to Consider; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. #. Use ptrtoint/inttoptr sparingly (they interfere with pointer aliasing; analysis), prefer GEPs. #. Prefer globals over inttoptr of a constant address - this gives you; dereferencability information. In MCJIT, use getSymbolAddress to provide; actual address. #. Be wary of ordered and atomic memory operations. They are hard to optimize; and may not be well optimized by the current optimizer. Depending on your; source language, you may consider using fences instead. #. If calling a function which is known to throw an exception (unwind), use; an invoke with a normal destination which contains an unreachable; instruction. This form conveys to the optimizer that the call returns; abnormally. For an invoke which neither returns normally or requires unwind; code in the current function, you can use a noreturn call instruction if; desired. This is generally not required because the optimizer will convert; an invoke with an unreachable unwind destination to a call instruction. #. Use profile metadata to indicate statically known cold paths, even if; dynamic profiling information is not available. This can make a large; difference in code placement and thus the performance of tight loops. #. When generating code for loops, try to avoid terminating the header block of; the loop earlier than necessary. If the terminator of the loop header; block is a loop exiting conditional branch, the effectiveness of LICM will; be limited for loads not in the header. (This is due to the fact that LLVM; may not know such a load is safe to speculatively execute and thus can't; lift an otherwise loop invariant load unless it can prove the exiting; condition is not taken.) It can be profitable, in some cases, to emit such; instructions into the header even if they are not used along a rarely; executed path that exits the loop.

The Foundation framework defines a; macro NS_RETURNS_RETAINED that is functionally equivalent to the; one shown below.; Placing on Objective-C methods: For Objective-C methods, this; annotation essentially tells the analyzer to treat the method as if its name; begins with ""alloc"" or ""new"" or contains the word; ""copy"".; Placing on C functions: For C functions returning Cocoa objects, the; analyzer typically does not make any assumptions about whether or not the object; is returned retained.

The ``exhaustive`` attribute specifies that the list of macros in the *config-macros-declaration* is exhaustive, meaning that no other macro definition is intended to have an effect on the API of that module. .. note::. The ``exhaustive`` attribute implies that any macro definitions; for macros not listed as configuration macros should be ignored; completely when building the module.

Performance,"ave your; scripts compiled, linked and dynamically loaded using the C++ compiler; and linker. The advantage of this is that your scripts will run with the; speed of compiled C++ and that you can use language constructs that are; not fully supported by Cling. On the other hand, you cannot use any Cling; shortcuts (see ""C++ Extensions To Ease Scripting"" above) and for small scripts, the; overhead of the compile/link cycle might be larger than just executing; the script in the interpreter. ACLiC will build a dictionary and a shared library from your C++; script, using the compiler and the compiler options that were used to; compile the ROOT executable. You do not have to write a Makefile; remembering the correct compiler options, and you do not have to exit; ROOT. ### Usage. Before you can compile your interpreted script you need to add include; statements for the classes used in the script. Once you did that, you; can build and load a shared library containing your script. To load it; use the command `.L` and append the file name with a `+`. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L MyScript.C+; ```. The + option generates the shared library and names it by taking; the name of the file ""filename"" but replacing the dot before the; extension by an underscore and by adding the shared library extension; for the current platform. For example on most platforms, `hsimple.cxx`; will generate `hsimple_cxx.so`. The + command rebuild the library only if the script or any of the; files it includes are newer than the library. When checking the; timestamp, ACLiC generates a dependency file which name is the same as; the library name, just replacing the 'so' extension by the extension; 'd'. For example on most platforms, `hsimple.cxx` will generate; `hsimple_cxx.d`. To ensure that the shared library is rebuilt you can use the ++; syntax:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L MyScript.C++; ```. To build, load, and execute the function with the same name as the; file you can use the `.x` command. This is the same as exe",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Cling.md:13642,load,load,13642,documentation/users-guide/Cling.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Cling.md,1,['load'],['load']

Performance,"away during the compilation process. This meta information provides an LLVM; user a relationship between generated code and the original program source; code. Currently, there are two backend consumers of debug info: DwarfDebug and; CodeViewDebug. DwarfDebug produces DWARF suitable for use with GDB, LLDB, and; other DWARF-based debuggers. :ref:`CodeViewDebug <codeview>` produces CodeView,; the Microsoft debug info format, which is usable with Microsoft debuggers such; as Visual Studio and WinDBG. LLVM's debug information format is mostly derived; from and inspired by DWARF, but it is feasible to translate into other target; debug info formats such as STABS. It would also be reasonable to use debug information to feed profiling tools; for analysis of generated code, or, tools for reconstructing the original; source from generated code. .. _intro_debugopt:. Debug information and optimizations; -----------------------------------. An extremely high priority of LLVM debugging information is to make it interact; well with optimizations and analysis. In particular, the LLVM debug; information provides the following guarantees:. * LLVM debug information **always provides information to accurately read; the source-level state of the program**, regardless of which LLVM; optimizations have been run. :doc:`HowToUpdateDebugInfo` specifies how debug; info should be updated in various kinds of code transformations to avoid; breaking this guarantee, and how to preserve as much useful debug info as; possible. Note that some optimizations may impact the ability to modify the; current state of the program with a debugger, such as setting program; variables, or calling functions that have been deleted. * As desired, LLVM optimizations can be upgraded to be aware of debugging; information, allowing them to update the debugging information as they; perform aggressive optimizations. This means that, with effort, the LLVM; optimizers could optimize debug code just as well as non-debug code",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:3762,optimiz,optimizations,3762,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']

This will collapse the register to zero or one, and everything but the offset; in the addressing mode to be less than or equal to 9. This means the full; address can only be guaranteed to be less than `(1 << 31) + 9`. The OS may wish; to protect an extra page of the low address space to account for this. ##### Optimizations. A very large portion of the cost for this approach comes from checking loads in; this way, so it is important to work to optimize this. However, beyond making; the instruction sequences to *apply* the checks efficient (for example by; avoiding `pushfq` and `popfq` sequences), the only significant optimization is; to check fewer loads without introducing a vulnerability. We apply several; techniques to accomplish that. ###### Don't check loads from compile-time constant stack offsets. We implement this optimization on x86 by skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset. The result of this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it. Consider code like the; following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; movq (%rcx), %rdi; movl (%rdi), %edx; ```. This will get transformed into:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movq (%rcx), %rdi # Hardened load.; movl (%rdi), %edx # Unhardened load due to ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:35011,optimiz,optimization,35011,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,2,"['load', 'optimiz']","['loads', 'optimization']"
Performance,"ax for invoking the option is discussed below. This feature is not intended to replace other debugging tools such as bugpoint.; Rather it provides an alternate course of action when reproducing the problem; requires a complex build infrastructure that would make using bugpoint; impractical or when reproducing the failure requires a sequence of; transformations that is difficult to replicate with tools like opt and llc. Getting Started; ===============. The -opt-bisect-limit command line option can be passed directly to tools such; as opt, llc and lli. The syntax is as follows:. ::. <tool name> [other options] -opt-bisect-limit=<limit>. If a value of -1 is used the tool will perform all optimizations but a message; will be printed to stderr for each optimization that could be skipped; indicating the index value that is associated with that optimization. To skip; optimizations, pass the value of the last optimization to be performed as the; opt-bisect-limit. All optimizations with a higher index value will be skipped. In order to use the -opt-bisect-limit option with a driver that provides a; wrapper around the LLVM core library, an additional prefix option may be; required, as defined by the driver. For example, to use this option with; clang, the ""-mllvm"" prefix must be used. A typical clang invocation would look; like this:. ::. clang -O2 -mllvm -opt-bisect-limit=256 my_file.c. The -opt-bisect-limit option may also be applied to link-time optimizations by; using a prefix to indicate that this is a plug-in option for the linker. The; following syntax will set a bisect limit for LTO transformations:. ::. # When using lld, or ld64 (macOS); clang -flto -Wl,-mllvm,-opt-bisect-limit=256 my_file.o my_other_file.o; # When using Gold; clang -flto -Wl,-plugin-opt,-opt-bisect-limit=256 my_file.o my_other_file.o.

To; insert a store instruction, use ``TargetInstrInfo::storeRegToStackSlot(...)``,; and to insert a load instruction, use ``TargetInstrInfo::loadRegFromStackSlot``. The indirect mapping shields the application developer from the complexities of; inserting load and store instructions. In order to map a virtual register to a; physical one, use ``VirtRegMap::assignVirt2Phys(vreg, preg)``. In order to map; a certain virtual register to memory, use; ``VirtRegMap::assignVirt2StackSlot(vreg)``. This method will return the stack; slot where ``vreg``'s value will be located. If it is necessary to map another; virtual register to the same stack slot, use; ``VirtRegMap::assignVirt2StackSlot(vreg, stack_location)``. One important point; to consider when using the indirect mapping, is that even if a virtual register; is mapped to memory, it still needs to be mapped to a physical register. This; physical register is the location where the virtual register is supposed to be; found before being stored or after being reloaded. If the indirect strategy is used, after all the virtual registers have been; mapped to physical registers or stack slots, it is necessary to use a spiller; object to place load and store instruction",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst:65023,load,load,65023,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,1,['load'],['load']
Performance,"ayer concept by using a new layer,; IRTransformLayer, to add IR optimization support to KaleidoscopeJIT. Optimizing Modules using the IRTransformLayer; =============================================. In `Chapter 4 <LangImpl04.html>`_ of the ""Implementing a language with LLVM""; tutorial series the llvm *FunctionPassManager* is introduced as a means for; optimizing LLVM IR. Interested readers may read that chapter for details, but; in short: to optimize a Module we create an llvm::FunctionPassManager; instance, configure it with a set of optimizations, then run the PassManager on; a Module to mutate it into a (hopefully) more optimized but semantically; equivalent form. In the original tutorial series the FunctionPassManager was; created outside the KaleidoscopeJIT and modules were optimized before being; added to it. In this Chapter we will make optimization a phase of our JIT; instead. For now this will provide us a motivation to learn more about ORC; layers, but in the long term making optimization part of our JIT will yield an; important benefit: When we begin lazily compiling code (i.e. deferring; compilation of each function until the first time it's run) having; optimization managed by our JIT will allow us to optimize lazily too, rather; than having to do all our optimization up-front. To add optimization support to our JIT we will take the KaleidoscopeJIT from; Chapter 1 and compose an ORC *IRTransformLayer* on top. We will look at how the; IRTransformLayer works in more detail below, but the interface is simple: the; constructor for this layer takes a reference to the execution session and the; layer below (as all layers do) plus an *IR optimization function* that it will; apply to each Module that is added via addModule:. .. code-block:: c++. class KaleidoscopeJIT {; private:; ExecutionSession ES;; RTDyldObjectLinkingLayer ObjectLayer;; IRCompileLayer CompileLayer;; IRTransformLayer TransformLayer;.

Performance,"ays converted to Python's ``str`` on function; returns (the exception is return-by-reference when assigning), but not when; its direct use is more likely such as in the case of (global) variables or; when iterating over a ``std::vector<std::string>``. The rest of this section shows examples of how STL containers can be used in; a natural, pythonistic, way. `std::vector`; -------------. A ``std::vector`` is the most commonly used C++ container type because it is; more efficient and performant than specialized types such as ``list`` and; ``map``, unless the number of elements gets very large.; Python has several similar types, from the builtin ``tuple`` and ``list``,; the ``array`` from builtin module ``array``, to ""as-good-as-builtin""; ``numpy.ndarray``.; A vector is more like the latter two in that it can contain only one type,; but more like the former two in that it can contain objects.; In practice, it can interplay well with all these containers, but e.g.; efficiency and performance can differ significantly. A vector can be instantiated from any sequence, including generators, and; vectors of objects can be recursively constructed.; If the template type is to be inferred from the argument to the constructor,; the first element needs to be accessible, which precludes generators. .. code-block:: python. >>> from cppyy.gbl.std import vector, pair; >>> v = vector[int](range(10)) # from generator; >>> len(v); 10; >>> v = vector([x for x in range(10)]) # type inferred; >>> type(v); <class cppyy.gbl.std.vector<int> at 0x12d226f00>; >>> len(v); 10; >>> vp = vector[pair[int, int]](((1, 2), (3, 4))); >>> len(vp); 2; >>> vp[1][0]; 3; >>>. To extend a vector in-place with another sequence object, use ``+=``, just as; for Python's ``list``:. .. code-block:: python. >>> v += range(10, 20); >>> len(v); 20; >>>. Indexing and slicing of a vector follows the normal Python slicing rules;; printing a vector prints all its elements:. .. code-block:: python. >>> v[1]; 1; >>> v[-1]; 1",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/stl.rst:2623,perform,performance,2623,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/stl.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/stl.rst,1,['perform'],['performance']

For; instance, the intrinsics permit:. * semi-space collectors. * mark-sweep collectors. * generational collectors. * incremental collectors. * concurrent collectors. * cooperative collectors. * reference counting. We hope that the support built into the LLVM IR is sufficient to support a; broad class of garbage collected languages including Scheme, ML, Java, C#,; Perl, Python, Lua, Ruby, other scripting languages, and more. Note that LLVM **does not itself provide a garbage collector** --- this should; be part of your language's runtime library. LLVM provides a framework for; describing the garbage collectors requirements to the compiler. In particular,; LLVM provides support for generating stack maps at call sites, polling for a; safepoint, and emitting load and store barriers. You can also extend LLVM -; possibly through a loadable :ref:`code generation plugins <plugin>` - to; generate code and data structures which conforms to the *binary interface*; specified by the *runtime library*. This is similar to the relationship between; LLVM and DWARF debugging info, for example. The difference primarily lies in; the lack of an established standard in the domain of garbage collection --- thus; the need for a flexible extension mechanism. The aspects of the binary interface with which LLVM's GC support is; concerned are:. * Creation of GC safepoints within code where collection is allowed to execute; safely. * Computation of the stack map. For each safe point in the code, object; references within the stack frame must be identified so that the collector may; traverse and perhaps update them. * Write barriers when storing object references to the heap.

Performance,"be ""invisible"" at tracking time. Let us suppose that we need to group together two volumes `A` and `B`; into a structure and position this into several other volumes `D,E,` and; `F`. What we need to do is to create a virtual container volume `C`; holding `A` and `B`, then position `C` in the other volumes. Note that `C` is a volume having a determined medium. Since it is not a; real volume, we need to manually set its medium the same as that of; `D,E` or `F` in order to make it ‘invisible' (same physics properties).; In other words, the limitation in proceeding this way is that `D,E,` and; `F` must point to the same medium. If this was not the case, we would; have to define different virtual volumes for each placement: `C`, `C'`; and `C""`, having the same shape but different media matching the; corresponding containers. This might not happen so often, but when it; does, it forces the creation of several extra virtual volumes. Other; limitation comes from the fact that any container is directly used by; navigation algorithms to optimize tracking. These must geometrically; contain their belongings (positioned volumes) so that these do not; extrude its shape boundaries. Not respecting this rule generally leads; to unpredictable results. Therefore `A` and `B` together must fit into; `C` that has to fit also into `D,E,` and `F`. This is not always; straightforward to accomplish, especially when instead of `A` and `B` we; have many more volumes. In order to avoid these problems, one can use for the difficult cases; the class **`TGeoVolumeAssembly`**, representing an assembly of volumes.; This behaves like a normal container volume supporting other volumes; positioned inside, but it has neither shape nor medium. It cannot be; used directly as a piece of the geometry, but just as a temporary; structure helping temporary assembling and positioning volumes.

Overview:; """""""""""""""""". The '``call``' instruction represents a simple function call. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". This instruction requires several arguments:. #. The optional ``tail`` and ``musttail`` markers indicate that the optimizers; should perform tail call optimization. The ``tail`` marker is a hint that; `can be ignored <CodeGenerator.html#tail-call-optimization>`_. The; ``musttail`` marker means that the call must be tail call optimized in order; for the program to be correct. This is true even in the presence of; attributes like ""disable-tail-calls"". The ``musttail`` marker provides these; guarantees:. #. The call will not cause unbounded stack growth if it is part of a; recursive cycle in the call graph.; #. Arguments with the :ref:`inalloca <attr_inalloca>` or; :ref:`preallocated <attr_preallocated>` attribute are forwarded in place.; #. If the musttail call appears in a function with the ``""thunk""`` attribute; and the caller and callee both have varargs, then any unprototyped; arguments in register or memory are forwarded to the callee. Similarly,; the return value of the callee is returned to the caller's caller, even; if a void return type is in use.

Performance,"be used to express the maximum acceptable error in the; result of that instruction, in ULPs, thus potentially allowing the; compiler to use a more efficient but less accurate method of computing; it. ULP is defined as follows:. If ``x`` is a real number that lies between two finite consecutive; floating-point numbers ``a`` and ``b``, without being equal to one; of them, then ``ulp(x) = |b - a|``, otherwise ``ulp(x)`` is the; distance between the two non-equal finite floating-point numbers; nearest ``x``. Moreover, ``ulp(NaN)`` is ``NaN``. The metadata node shall consist of a single positive float type number; representing the maximum relative error, for example:. .. code-block:: llvm. !0 = !{ float 2.5 } ; maximum acceptable inaccuracy is 2.5 ULPs. .. _range-metadata:. '``range``' Metadata; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``range`` metadata may be attached only to ``load``, ``call`` and ``invoke`` of; integer or vector of integer types. It expresses the possible ranges the loaded; value or the value returned by the called function at this call site is in. If; the loaded or returned value is not in the specified range, a poison value is; returned instead. The ranges are represented with a flattened list of integers.; The loaded value or the value returned is known to be in the union of the ranges; defined by each consecutive pair. Each pair has the following properties:. - The type must match the scalar type of the instruction.; - The pair ``a,b`` represents the range ``[a,b)``.; - Both ``a`` and ``b`` are constants.; - The range is allowed to wrap.; - The range should not represent the full or empty set. That is,; ``a!=b``. In addition, the pairs must be in signed order of the lower bound and; they must be non-contiguous. For vector-typed instructions, the range is applied element-wise. Examples:. .. code-block:: llvm. %a = load i8, ptr %x, align 1, !range !0 ; Can only be 0 or 1; %b = load i8, ptr %y, align 1, !range !1 ; Can only be 255 (-1), 0 or 1; %c = call i8 @foo(), !ra",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:284932,load,loaded,284932,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['load'],['loaded']

It is worth noting that -; on shared systems or if running other heavy applications - the number of your own threads; running at any time may be lower than the limit due to demand on the CPU.; - The 'Real Time' is similar to 'CPU Time / number of threads' AND 'Compressed Throughput' is lower than expected; for your storage medium: this would imply that your CPU threads aren't decompressing data as fast as your storage; medium can provide it, and so decompression is the bottleneck.; The best way to decrease your runtime would be to utilise a system with a faster CPU, or make use; use of more threads when running, or use a compression algorithm with a higher decompression rate such as LZ4,; possibly at the cost of some extra file size. ### A note on caching.

Performance,"between `Streamer` writers and readers are frequent; and increase as the number of classes increase. We recommend you use; `rootcling` generated `Streamers` whenever you can, and profit from the; automatic schema evolution. ### Building Class Definitions with the StreamerInfo. A ROOT file's `StreamerInfo `list contains the description of all; versions of all classes in the file. When a file is opened the; `StreamerInfo `is read into memory and it provides enough information to; make the file browsable. The `TStreamerInfo `enables us to recreate a; header file for the class in case the compiled class is not available.; This is done with the `TFile::MakeProject` method. It creates a; directory with the header files for the named classes and a `makefile`; to compile a shared library with the class definitions. ### Example: MakeProject. To explain the details, we use the example of the `ATLFast` project that; is a fast simulation for the ATLAS experiment. The complete source for; `ATLFast` can be down loaded at; <ftp://root.cern.ch/root/atlfast.tar.gz>. Once we compile and run; `ATLFast` we get a ROOT file called `atlfast.root`, containing the; `ATLFast` objects.

Performance,"between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a; future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that; creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a; ``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread. For kernarg backing memory:. * CP invalidates the L0 and L1 caches at the start of each kernel dispatch.; * On dGPU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid; needing to invalidate the L2 cache.; * On APU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent) and; so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents. Scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space) is accessed; with MTYPE NC (non-coherent). Since the private address space is only accessed; by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is never a need to; invalidate these entries from the L0 or L1 caches. Wavefronts are executed in native mode with in-order reporting of loads and; sample instructions. In this mode vmcnt reports completion of load, atomic with; return and sample instructions in order, and the vscnt reports the completion of; store and atomic without return in order.

In addition; to adding new features (LLVM did not always support exceptions or debug; info), we also extend the IR to capture important information for; optimization (e.g. whether an argument is sign or zero extended,; information about pointers aliasing, etc). Many of the enhancements are; user-driven: people want LLVM to include some specific feature, so they; go ahead and extend it. Third, it is *possible and easy* to add language-specific optimizations,; and you have a number of choices in how to do it. As one trivial; example, it is easy to add language-specific optimization passes that; ""know"" things about code compiled for a language. In the case of the C; family, there is an optimization pass that ""knows"" about the standard C; library functions. If you call ""exit(0)"" in main(), it knows that it is; safe to optimize that into ""return 0;"" because C specifies what the; 'exit' function does. In addition to simple library knowledge, it is possible to embed a; variety of other language-specific information into the LLVM IR.

If you encounter a bug that leads to crashes in the LLVM LTO phase when using; the ``-flto`` option, follow these steps to diagnose and report the issue:. Compile your source file to a ``.bc`` (Bitcode) file with the following options,; in addition to your existing compilation options:. .. code-block:: bash. export CFLAGS=""-flto -fuse-ld=lld"" CXXFLAGS=""-flto -fuse-ld=lld"" LDFLAGS=""-Wl,-plugin-opt=save-temps"". These options enable LTO and save temporary files generated during compilation; for later analysis. On Windows, you should be using lld-link as the linker. Adjust your compilation ; flags as follows:; * Add ``/lldsavetemps`` to the linker flags.; * When linking from the compiler driver, add ``/link /lldsavetemps`` in order to forward that flag to the linker. Using the specified flags will generate four intermediate bytecode files:. #. a.out.0.0.preopt.bc (Before any link-time optimizations (LTO) are applied); #. a.out.0.2.internalize.bc (After initial optimizations are applied); #. a.out.0.4.opt.bc (After an extensive set of optimizations); #. a.out.0.5.precodegen.bc (After LTO but before translating into machine code). Execute one of the following commands to identify the source of the problem:. #. ``opt ""-passes=lto<O3>"" a.out.0.2.internalize.bc``; #. ``llc a.out.0.5.precodegen.bc``.

In case of *read write* access, ``1`` is to be used. ``locality``; indicates the expected persistence of data in cache, from ``0`` which means that; data can be discarded from cache after its next use to ``3`` which means that; data is going to be reused a lot once in cache. ``1`` and ``2`` provide; intermediate behavior between these two extremes.

Safety is an interesting; property that requires a combination of language design, runtime; support, and often operating system support. It is certainly possible to implement a safe language in LLVM, but LLVM; IR does not itself guarantee safety. The LLVM IR allows unsafe pointer; casts, use after free bugs, buffer over-runs, and a variety of other; problems. Safety needs to be implemented as a layer on top of LLVM and,; conveniently, several groups have investigated this. Ask on the `LLVM; forums <https://discourse.llvm.org>`_ if you are interested in more details. Language-Specific Optimizations; -------------------------------. One thing about LLVM that turns off many people is that it does not; solve all the world's problems in one system. One specific; complaint is that people perceive LLVM as being incapable of performing; high-level language-specific optimization: LLVM ""loses too much; information"". Here are a few observations about this:. First, you're right that LLVM does lose information. For example, as of; this writing, there is no way to distinguish in the LLVM IR whether an; SSA-value came from a C ""int"" or a C ""long"" on an ILP32 machine (other; than debug info). Both get compiled down to an 'i32' value and the; information about what it came from is lost. The more general issue; here, is that the LLVM type system uses ""structural equivalence"" instead; of ""name equivalence"". Another place this surprises people is if you; have two types in a high-level language that have the same structure; (e.g. two different structs that have a single int field): these types; will compile down into a single LLVM type and it will be impossible to; tell what it came from. Second, while LLVM does lose information, LLVM is not a fixed target: we; continue to enhance and improve it in many different ways.

So, if you need to; place a ``MemoryDef`` in ``if.then`` or ``if.else``, you'll need to also create; a ``MemoryPhi`` for ``if.end``. If it turns out that this is a large burden, we can just place ``MemoryPhi``\ s; everywhere. Because we have Walkers that are capable of optimizing above said; phis, doing so shouldn't prohibit optimizations. Non-Goals; ---------. ``MemorySSA`` is meant to reason about the relation between memory; operations, and enable quicker querying.; It isn't meant to be the single source of truth for all potential memory-related; optimizations. Specifically, care must be taken when trying to use ``MemorySSA``; to reason about atomic or volatile operations, as in:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8 @foo(ptr %a) {; entry:; br i1 undef, label %if.then, label %if.end. if.then:; ; 1 = MemoryDef(liveOnEntry); %0 = load volatile i8, ptr %a; br label %if.end. if.end:; %av = phi i8 [0, %entry], [%0, %if.then]; ret i8 %av; }. Going solely by ``MemorySSA``'s analysis, hoisting the ``load`` to ``entry`` may; seem legal. Because it's a volatile load, though, it's not. Design tradeoffs; ----------------. Precision; ^^^^^^^^^. ``MemorySSA`` in LLVM deliberately trades off precision for speed.; Let us think about memory variables as if they were disjoint partitions of the; memory (that is, if you have one variable, as above, it represents the entire; memory, and if you have multiple variables, each one represents some; disjoint portion of the memory). First, because alias analysis results conflict with each other, and; each result may be what an analysis wants (IE; TBAA may say no-alias, and something else may say must-alias), it is; not possible to partition the memory the way every optimization wants.; Second, some alias analysis results are not transitive (IE A noalias B,; and B noalias C, does not me",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst:16314,load,load,16314,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,1,['load'],['load']

DESCRIPTION; -----------. **bugpoint** narrows down the source of problems in LLVM tools and passes. It; can be used to debug three types of failures: optimizer crashes, miscompilations; by optimizers, or bad native code generation (including problems in the static; and JIT compilers). It aims to reduce large test cases to small, useful ones.; For more information on the design and inner workings of **bugpoint**, as well as; advice for using bugpoint, see :doc:`/Bugpoint` in the LLVM; distribution. OPTIONS; -------. **--additional-so** *library*. Load the dynamic shared object *library* into the test program whenever it is; run. This is useful if you are debugging programs which depend on non-LLVM; libraries (such as the X or curses libraries) to run. **--append-exit-code**\ =\ *{true,false}*. Append the test programs exit code to the output file so that a change in exit; code is considered a test failure. Defaults to false. **--args** *program args*. Pass all arguments specified after **--args** to the test program whenever it runs.; Note that if any of the *program args* start with a ""``-``"", you should use:. .. code-block:: bash. bugpoint [bugpoint args] --args -- [program args]. The ""``--``"" right after the **--args** option tells **bugpoint** to consider; any options starting with ""``-``"" to be part of the **--args** option, not as; options to **bugpoint** itself. **--tool-args** *tool args*.

Performance,"build configurations. Multi-stage PGO; ===============. Profile-Guided Optimizations (PGO) is a really great way to optimize the code; clang generates. Our multi-stage PGO builds are a workflow for generating PGO; profiles that can be used to optimize clang. At a high level, the way PGO works is that you build an instrumented compiler,; then you run the instrumented compiler against sample source files. While the; instrumented compiler runs it will output a bunch of files containing; performance counters (.profraw files). After generating all the profraw files; you use llvm-profdata to merge the files into a single profdata file that you; can feed into the LLVM_PROFDATA_FILE option. Our PGO.cmake cache automates that whole process. You can use it for; configuration with CMake with the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; <path to source>/llvm. There are several additional options that the cache file also accepts to modify; the build, particularly the PGO_INSTRUMENT_LTO option. Setting this option to; Thin or Full will enable ThinLTO or full LTO respectively, further enhancing; the performance gains from a PGO build by enabling interprocedural; optimizations. For example, to run a CMake configuration for a PGO build; that also enables ThinTLO, use the following command:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to source>/clang/cmake/caches/PGO.cmake \; -DPGO_INSTRUMENT_LTO=Thin \; <path to source>/llvm. By default, clang will generate profile data by compiling a simple; hello world program. You can also tell clang use an external; project for generating profile data that may be a better fit for your; use case. The project you specify must either be a lit test suite; (use the CLANG_PGO_TRAINING_DATA option) or a CMake project (use the; CLANG_PERF_TRAINING_DATA_SOURCE_DIR option).

The only; difference is you need to append a + or a ++. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .x MyScript.C+(4000); Creating shared library /home/./MyScript_C.so; ```. You can select whether the script in compiled with debug symbol or; with optimization by appending the letter 'g' or 'O' after the '+' or; '++'. Without the specification, the script is compiled with the same; level of debugging symbol and optimization as the currently running; ROOT executable. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L MyScript.C++g; ```. will compile `MyScript.C` with debug symbols; usually this means; giving the `-g` option to compiler. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L MyScript.C++O; ```. will compile `MyScript.C` with optimizations; usually this means; giving the `-O` option to compiler. The syntax:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L MyScript.C++; ```. is using the default optimization level. The initial default is to; compile with the same level of optimization as the root executable; itself. The default can be changed by:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gSystem->SetAclicMode(TSystem::kDebug);; root[] gSystem->SetAclicMode(TSystem::kOpt);; ```. Note that the commands:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L MyScript.C+g; root[] .L MyScript.C+O; ```. respectively compile `MyScript.C` with debug and optimization if the; library does not exist yet; they will not change the debug and the; optimization level if the library already exist and it is up to date.; To use ACLiC from compiled code or from inside another macro, we; recommend using `gROOT->ProcessLine()`. For; example, in one script you can use ACLiC to compile and load another; script. ``` {.cpp}; gROOT->ProcessLine("".L MyScript.C+""); gROOT->ProcessLine("".L MyScript.C++""); ```. ### Setting the Include Path.

Performance,"but if you have; information in your source language about the range of an integer value, it can; be profitable to use a zext rather than a sext. Alternatively, you can :ref:`specify the range of the value using metadata; <range-metadata>` and LLVM can do the sext to zext conversion for you. Zext GEP indices to machine register width; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Internally, LLVM often promotes the width of GEP indices to machine register; width. When it does so, it will default to using sign extension (sext); operations for safety. If your source language provides information about; the range of the index, you may wish to manually extend indices to machine; register width using a zext instruction. When to specify alignment; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; LLVM will always generate correct code if you don’t specify alignment, but may; generate inefficient code. For example, if you are targeting MIPS (or older; ARM ISAs) then the hardware does not handle unaligned loads and stores, and; so you will enter a trap-and-emulate path if you do a load or store with; lower-than-natural alignment. To avoid this, LLVM will emit a slower; sequence of loads, shifts and masks (or load-right + load-left on MIPS) for; all cases where the load / store does not have a sufficiently high alignment; in the IR. The alignment is used to guarantee the alignment on allocas and globals,; though in most cases this is unnecessary (most targets have a sufficiently; high default alignment that they’ll be fine). It is also used to provide a; contract to the back end saying ‘either this load/store has this alignment, or; it is undefined behavior’. This means that the back end is free to emit; instructions that rely on that alignment (and mid-level optimizers are free to; perform transforms that require that alignment). For x86, it doesn’t make; much difference, as almost all instructions are alignment-independent. For; MIPS, it can make a big difference.

In an init method, ``self``; follows the :ref:``init family rules <arc.family.semantics.init>``. .. admonition:: Rationale. The cost of retaining ``self`` in all methods was found to be prohibitive, as; it tends to be live across calls, preventing the optimizer from proving that; the retain and release are unnecessary --- for good reason, as it's quite; possible in theory to cause an object to be deallocated during its execution; without this retain and release. Since it's extremely uncommon to actually; do so, even unintentionally, and since there's no natural way for the; programmer to remove this retain/release pair otherwise (as there is for; other parameters by, say, making the variable ``objc_externally_retained`` or; qualifying it with ``__unsafe_unretained``), we chose to make this optimizing; assumption and shift some amount of risk to the user. .. _arc.misc.enumeration:.

See the *HSA Platform System Architecture; Specification* [HSA]_ for the AQL queue mechanics and packet layouts. The packet processor of a kernel agent is responsible for detecting and; dispatching HSA kernels from the AQL queues associated with it. For AMD GPUs the; packet processor is implemented by the hardware command processor (CP),; asynchronous dispatch controller (ADC) and shader processor input controller; (SPI). An HSA compatible runtime can be used to allocate an AQL queue object. It uses; the kernel mode driver to initialize and register the AQL queue with CP. To dispatch a kernel the following actions are performed. This can occur in the; CPU host program, or from an HSA kernel executing on a GPU. 1.

Definitions typically live in header files and symbols in libraries.; Headers can be loaded with ``cppyy.include`` and libraries with the; ``cppyy.load_library`` call.; Loading the header is sufficient to start exploring, with ``cppyy.gbl`` the; starting point of all things C++, while the linker symbols are only needed at ; the point of first use.

Be patient. Since we cannot set a breakpoint in our pass yet; (the shared object isn't loaded until runtime), we must execute the process,; and have it stop before it invokes our pass, but after it has loaded the shared; object. The most foolproof way of doing this is to set a breakpoint in; ``PassManager::run`` and then run the process with the arguments you want:. .. code-block:: console. $ (gdb) break llvm::PassManager::run; Breakpoint 1 at 0x2413bc: file Pass.cpp, line 70.; (gdb) run test.bc -load $(LLVMTOP)/llvm/Debug+Asserts/lib/[libname].so -[passoption]; Starting program: opt test.bc -load $(LLVMTOP)/llvm/Debug+Asserts/lib/[libname].so -[passoption]; Breakpoint 1, PassManager::run (this=0xffbef174, M=@0x70b298) at Pass.cpp:70; 70 bool PassManager::run(Module &M) { return PM->run(M); }; (gdb).

Miscellaneous Problems; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Once you have the basics down, there are a couple of problems that GDB has,; some with solutions, some without. * Inline functions have bogus stack information. In general, GDB does a pretty; good job getting stack traces and stepping through inline functions. When a; pass is dynamically loaded however, it somehow completely loses this; capability.

Configuration files group command-line options and allow all of them to be; specified just by referencing the configuration file. They may be used, for; example, to collect options required to tune compilation for particular; target, such as ``-L``, ``-I``, ``-l``, ``--sysroot``, codegen options, etc. Configuration files can be either specified on the command line or loaded; from default locations. If both variants are present, the default configuration; files are loaded first. The command line option ``--config=`` can be used to specify explicit; configuration files in a Clang invocation. If the option is used multiple times,; all specified files are loaded, in order. For example:. ::. clang --config=/home/user/cfgs/testing.txt; clang --config=debug.cfg --config=runtimes.cfg. If the provided argument contains a directory separator, it is considered as; a file path, and options are read from that file. Otherwise the argument is; treated as a file name and is searched for sequentially in the directories:. - user directory,; - system directory,; - the directory where Clang executable resides. Both user and system directories for configuration files are specified during; clang build using CMake parameters, ``CLANG_CONFIG_FILE_USER_DIR`` and; ``CLANG_CONFIG_FILE_SYSTEM_DIR`` respectively. The first file found is used.; It is an error if the required file cannot be found.

Performance,"c function"". These functions; have well known names and semantics and are required to follow certain; restrictions. Overall, these intrinsics represent an extension mechanism; for the LLVM language that does not require changing all of the; transformations in LLVM when adding to the language (or the bitcode; reader/writer, the parser, etc...). Intrinsic function names must all start with an ""``llvm.``"" prefix. This; prefix is reserved in LLVM for intrinsic names; thus, function names may; not begin with this prefix. Intrinsic functions must always be external; functions: you cannot define the body of intrinsic functions. Intrinsic; functions may only be used in call or invoke instructions: it is illegal; to take the address of an intrinsic function. Additionally, because; intrinsic functions are part of the LLVM language, it is required if any; are added that they be documented here. Some intrinsic functions can be overloaded, i.e., the intrinsic; represents a family of functions that perform the same operation but on; different data types. Because LLVM can represent over 8 million; different integer types, overloading is used commonly to allow an; intrinsic function to operate on any integer type. One or more of the; argument types or the result type can be overloaded to accept any; integer type. Argument types may also be defined as exactly matching a; previous argument's type or the result type. This allows an intrinsic; function which accepts multiple arguments, but needs all of them to be; of the same type, to only be overloaded with respect to a single; argument or the result. Overloaded intrinsics will have the names of its overloaded argument; types encoded into its function name, each preceded by a period. Only; those types which are overloaded result in a name suffix. Arguments; whose type is matched against another type do not. For example, the; ``llvm.ctpop`` function can take an integer of any width and returns an; integer of exactly the same integer wid",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:488989,perform,perform,488989,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['perform'],['perform']

Performance,"c ordering involved, concurrency does not matter, with; one exception: if a variable might be visible to another thread or signal; handler, a store cannot be inserted along a path where it might not execute; otherwise. Take the following example:. .. code-block:: c. /* C code, for readability; run through clang -O2 -S -emit-llvm to get; equivalent IR */; int x;; void f(int* a) {; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); x += 1;; }; }. The following is equivalent in non-concurrent situations:. .. code-block:: c. int x;; void f(int* a) {; int xtemp = x;; for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; if (a[i]); xtemp += 1;; }; x = xtemp;; }. However, LLVM is not allowed to transform the former to the latter: it could; indirectly introduce undefined behavior if another thread can access ``x`` at; the same time. That thread would read `undef` instead of the value it was; expecting, which can lead to undefined behavior down the line. (This example is; particularly of interest because before the concurrency model was implemented,; LLVM would perform this transformation.). Note that speculative loads are allowed; a load which is part of a race returns; ``undef``, but does not have undefined behavior. Atomic instructions; ===================. For cases where simple loads and stores are not sufficient, LLVM provides; various atomic instructions. The exact guarantees provided depend on the; ordering; see `Atomic orderings`_. ``load atomic`` and ``store atomic`` provide the same basic functionality as; non-atomic loads and stores, but provide additional guarantees in situations; where threads and signals are involved. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are essentially like an atomic load followed by an; atomic store (where the store is conditional for ``cmpxchg``), but no other; memory operation can happen on any thread between the load and store.

Performance,"ca's and spill slots), the prolog and epilog code for the function; can be inserted and ""abstract stack location references"" can be eliminated.; This stage is responsible for implementing optimizations like frame-pointer; elimination and stack packing. 6. `Late Machine Code Optimizations`_ --- Optimizations that operate on ""final""; machine code can go here, such as spill code scheduling and peephole; optimizations. 7. `Code Emission`_ --- The final stage actually puts out the code for the; current function, either in the target assembler format or in machine; code. The code generator is based on the assumption that the instruction selector will; use an optimal pattern matching selector to create high-quality sequences of; native instructions. Alternative code generator designs based on pattern; expansion and aggressive iterative peephole optimization are much slower. This; design permits efficient compilation (important for JIT environments) and; aggressive optimization (used when generating code offline) by allowing; components of varying levels of sophistication to be used for any step of; compilation. In addition to these stages, target implementations can insert arbitrary; target-specific passes into the flow. For example, the X86 target uses a; special pass to handle the 80x87 floating point stack architecture. Other; targets with unusual requirements can be supported with custom passes as needed. Using TableGen for target description; -------------------------------------. The target description classes require a detailed description of the target; architecture. These target descriptions often have a large amount of common; information (e.g., an ``add`` instruction is almost identical to a ``sub``; instruction).

Performance,"calar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a; future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that; creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a; ``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread. For kernarg backing memory:. * CP invalidates the L1 cache at the start of each kernel dispatch.; * On dGPU over XGMI or PCIe the kernarg backing memory is allocated in host; memory accessed as MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid needing to invalidate the L2; cache. This also causes it to be treated as non-volatile and so is not; invalidated by ``*_vol``.; * On APU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent) and; so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents. Scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space) is accessed; with MTYPE NC_NV (non-coherent non-volatile).

Performance,"calar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a; future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that; creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a; ``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread. For kernarg backing memory:. * CP invalidates the L1 cache at the start of each kernel dispatch.; * On dGPU over XGMI or PCIe the kernarg backing memory is allocated in host; memory accessed as MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid needing to invalidate the L2; cache. This also causes it to be treated as non-volatile and so is not; invalidated by ``*_vol``.; * On APU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent) and; so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents. Scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space) is accessed; with MTYPE NC_NV (non-coherent non-volatile). Since the private address space is; only accessed by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is; never a need to invalidate these entries from the L1 cache.

Performance,"cans every function and allowing function passes to run a module; analysis may cause us to scan functions a quadratic number of times. If passes; could keep outer level analyses up to date rather than computing them on demand; this wouldn't be an issue, but that would be a lot of work to ensure every pass; updates all outer level analyses, and so far this hasn't been necessary and; there isn't infrastructure for this (aside from function analyses in loop passes; as described below). Self-updating analyses that gracefully degrade also handle; this problem (e.g. GlobalsAA), but they run into the issue of having to be; manually recomputed somewhere in the optimization pipeline if we want precision,; and they block potential future concurrency. The second reason is to keep in mind potential future pass concurrency, for; example parallelizing function passes over different functions in a CGSCC or; module. Since passes can ask for a cached analysis result, allowing passes to; trigger outer level analysis computation could result in non-determinism if; concurrency was supported. A related limitation is that outer level IR analyses; that are used must be immutable, or else they could be invalidated by changes to; inner level IR. Outer analyses unused by inner passes can and often will be; invalidated by changes to inner level IR. These invalidations happen after the; inner pass manager finishes, so accessing mutable analyses would give invalid; results. The exception to not being able to access outer level analyses is accessing; function analyses in loop passes. Loop passes often use function analyses such; as the dominator tree. Loop passes inherently require modifying the function the; loop is in, and that includes some function analyses the loop analyses depend; on. This discounts future concurrency over separate loops in a function, but; that's a tradeoff due to how tightly a loop and its function are coupled.

Performance,"case, we want to be able to elide copies into ``bar``'s argument; slots. That means we need to have more than one set of argument frames; active at the same time. First, we need to allocate the frame for the; outer call so we can pass it in as the hidden struct return pointer to; the middle call. Then we do the same for the middle call, allocating a; frame and passing its address to ``Foo``'s default constructor. By; wrapping the evaluation of the inner ``bar`` with stack save and; restore, we can have multiple overlapping active call frames. Callee-cleanup Calling Conventions; ----------------------------------. Another wrinkle is the existence of callee-cleanup conventions. On; Windows, all methods and many other functions adjust the stack to clear; the memory used to pass their arguments. In some sense, this means that; the allocas are automatically cleared by the call. However, LLVM; instead models this as a write of undef to all of the inalloca values; passed to the call instead of a stack adjustment. Frontends should; still restore the stack pointer to avoid a stack leak. Exceptions; ----------. There is also the possibility of an exception. If argument evaluation; or copy construction throws an exception, the landing pad must do; cleanup, which includes adjusting the stack pointer to avoid a stack; leak. This means the cleanup of the stack memory cannot be tied to the; call itself. There needs to be a separate IR-level instruction that can; perform independent cleanup of arguments. Efficiency; ----------. Eventually, it should be possible to generate efficient code for this; construct. In particular, using inalloca should not require a base; pointer. If the backend can prove that all points in the CFG only have; one possible stack level, then it can address the stack directly from; the stack pointer. While this is not yet implemented, the plan is that; the inalloca attribute should not change much, but the frontend IR; generation recommendations may change.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/InAlloca.rst:5776,perform,perform,5776,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/InAlloca.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/InAlloca.rst,1,['perform'],['perform']

We ran both; Google's microbenchmark suite and a large highly-tuned server built using; ThinLTO and PGO. All were built with `-march=haswell` to give access to BMI2; instructions, and benchmarks were run on large Haswell servers. We collected; data both with an `lfence`-based mitigation and load hardening as presented; here. The summary is that mitigating with load hardening is 1.77x faster than; mitigating with `lfence`, and the overhead of load hardening compared to a; normal program is likely between a 10% overhead and a 50% overhead with most; large applications seeing a 30% overhead or less. | Benchmark | `lfence` | Load Hard",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:46734,perform,performance,46734,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['perform'],['performance']

Assuming you want to write your; language's compiler in the language itself (rather than C++), there are 3; major ways to tackle generating LLVM IR from a front-end:. 1. **Call into the LLVM libraries code using your language's FFI (foreign; function interface).**. * *for:* best tracks changes to the LLVM IR, .ll syntax, and .bc format. * *for:* enables running LLVM optimization passes without a emit/parse; overhead. * *for:* adapts well to a JIT context. * *against:* lots of ugly glue code to write. 2. **Emit LLVM assembly from your compiler's native language.**. * *for:* very straightforward to get started. * *against:* the .ll parser is slower than the bitcode reader when; interfacing to the middle end. * *against:* it may be harder to track changes to the IR. 3. **Emit LLVM bitcode from your compiler's native language.**. * *for:* can use the more-efficient bitcode reader when interfacing to the; middle end. * *against:* you'll have to re-engineer the LLVM IR object model and bitcode; writer in your language. * *against:* it may be harder to track changes to the IR. If you go with the first option, the C bindings in include/llvm-c should help; a lot, since most languages have strong support for interfacing with C.

JITLink passes are ``std::function<Error(LinkGraph&)>`` instances. They are free; to inspect and modify the given ``LinkGraph`` subject to the constraints of; whatever phase they are running in (see :ref:`generic_link_algorithm`). If a; pass returns ``Error::success()`` then linking continues. If a pass returns; a failure value then linking is stopped and the ``JITLinkContext`` is notified; that the link failed. Passes may be used by both JITLink backends (e.g. MachO/x86-64 implements GOT; and PLT construction as a pass), and external clients like; ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin``. In combination with the open ``LinkGraph`` API, JITLink passes enable the; implementation of powerful new features. For example:. * Relaxation optimizations -- A pre-fixup pass can inspect GOT accesses and PLT; calls and identify situations where the addresses of the entry target and the; access are close enough to be accessed directly. In this case the pass can; rewrite the instruction stream of the containing block and update the fixup; edges to make the access direct. Code for this looks like:. .. code-block:: c++.

If `T` is a transformation used for; positioning volume daughters, then: `MASTER = T * LOCAL`. Therefore `T `is used to perform a local to master conversion, while; `T-1` for a master to local conversion. The second use case is the; computation of the global transformation of a given object in the; geometry. Since the geometry is built as 'volumes-inside-volumes', the; global transformation represents the pile-up of all local; transformations in the corresponding branch. Once a given object in the; hierarchy becomes the current one, the conversion from master to local; coordinates or the other way around can be done from the manager class.

The only exception to; this guidance is that a unified return block with high in-degree is fine. Use of allocas; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. An alloca instruction can be used to represent a function scoped stack slot,; but can also represent dynamic frame expansion. When representing function; scoped variables or locations, placing alloca instructions at the beginning of; the entry block should be preferred.

The main focus for the technology preview was not in performance until recently.; We have invested some resources in optimizations and we would like to show you; (probably outdated) performance results:. * Memory footprint -- mostly due to importing all C++ Modules at startup; we see overhead which depends on the number of preloaded modules. For; ROOT it is between 40-60 MB depending on the concrete configuration.; When the workload increases we notice that the overall memory performance; decreases in number of cases.; * Execution times -- likewise we have an execution overhead. For ; workflows which take ms the slowdown can be 2x. Increasing of the work; to seconds shows 50-60% slowdowns. The performance is dependent on many factors such as configuration of ROOT and; workflow. You can read more at our Intel IPCC-ROOT Showcase presentation; here (pp 25-33)[[8]]. #### Loading C++ Modules on Demand. In long term, we should optimize the preloading of modules to be a no-op and; avoid recursive behavior based on identifier lookup callbacks. Unfortunately,; at the moment the loading of C++ modules on demand shows significantly better; performance results. You can visit our continuous performance monitoring tool where we compare; the performance of ROOT against ROOT with a PCH [[9]].; *Note: if you get error 400, clean your cache or open a private browser session.*. ## How to use; C++ Modules in ROOT are default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX).

Performance,"ch wishes to relocate objects directly reachable from; running code, a higher standard is required. One additional challenge is that the compiler may compute intermediate; results (""derived pointers"") which point outside of the allocation or; even into the middle of another allocation. The eventual use of this; intermediate value must yield an address within the bounds of the; allocation, but such ""exterior derived pointers"" may be visible to the; collector. Given this, a garbage collector can not safely rely on the; runtime value of an address to indicate the object it is associated; with. If the garbage collector wishes to move any object, the; compiler must provide a mapping, for each pointer, to an indication of; its allocation. To simplify the interaction between a collector and the compiled code,; most garbage collectors are organized in terms of three abstractions:; load barriers, store barriers, and safepoints. #. A load barrier is a bit of code executed immediately after the; machine load instruction, but before any use of the value loaded.; Depending on the collector, such a barrier may be needed for all; loads, merely loads of a particular type (in the original source; language), or none at all. #. Analogously, a store barrier is a code fragment that runs; immediately before the machine store instruction, but after the; computation of the value stored. The most common use of a store; barrier is to update a 'card table' in a generational garbage; collector. #. A safepoint is a location at which pointers visible to the compiled; code (i.e. currently in registers or on the stack) are allowed to; change. After the safepoint completes, the actual pointer value; may differ, but the 'object' (as seen by the source language); pointed to will not. Note that the term 'safepoint' is somewhat overloaded.

In the for-loop, we need to add another for-loop to go over all the; tracks. In the outer for-loop, we get the entry and the number of; tracks. In the inner for-loop, we fill the large histogram (`myHisto`); with all tracks and the small histogram (`smallHisto`) with the track if; it is in the first 100. ``` {.cpp}; ...; for (Int_t jentry=0; jentry<nentries;jentry++) {; GetEntry(jentry);; for (Int_t j = 0; j < 100; j++) {; myHisto->Fill(fTracks_fPx[j]);; if (j < 100) {; smallHisto->Fill(fTracks_fPx[j]);; }; }; }; ...; ```.

Performance,"char *name, Double_t *point[3],; Double_t *norm[3]);; ```. ### Composite Shapes. Composite shapes are Boolean combinations of two or more shape; components. The supported Boolean operations are union (+), intersection; (\*) and subtraction(-). Composite shapes derive from the base; **`TGeoShape`** class, therefore providing all shape features:; computation of bounding box, finding if a given point is inside or; outside the combination, as well as computing the distance to; entering/exiting. They can be directly used for creating volumes or used; in the definition of other composite shapes. Composite shapes are provided in order to complement and extend the set; of basic shape primitives. They have a binary tree internal structure,; therefore all shape-related geometry queries are signals propagated from; top level down to the final leaves, while the provided answers are; assembled and interpreted back at top. This `CSG`; `(composite solid geometry)` hierarchy is effective for small number of; components, while performance drops dramatically for large structures.; Building a complete geometry in this style is virtually possible but; highly not recommended. #### The Structure of Composite Shapes. A composite shape can always be looked as the result of a Boolean; operation between only two shape components. All information identifying; these two components as well as their positions with respect to the; frame of the composite is represented by an object called Boolean node.; A composite shape has a pointer to such a Boolean node. Since the shape; components may also be composites, they will also contain binary Boolean; nodes branching out other two shapes in the hierarchy. Any such branch; ends-up when the final leaves are no longer composite shapes, but basic; primitives. The figure shows the composite shapes structure. ![The composite shapes structure](pictures/080001CA.png).

Performance,"checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence. It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exceed that of an `lfence` when *correctly* speculatively; executed. But in that case, the `lfence` cost is a complete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model. Several optimizations were considered which didn't pan out due to failure to; uphold the security model. One in particular is worth discussing as many others; will reduce to it. We wondered whether only the *first* load in a basic block could be checked. If; the check works as intended, it forms an invalid pointer that doesn't even; virtual-address translate in the hardware. It should fault very early on in its; processing. Maybe that would stop things in time for the misspeculated path to; fail to leak any secrets. This doesn't end up working because the processor is; fundamentally out-of-order, even in its speculative domain. As a consequence,; the attacker could cause the initial address computation itself to stall and; allow an arbitrary number of unrelated loads (including attacked loads of; secret data) to pass through. #### Interprocedural Checking. Modern x86 processors may speculate into called functions and out of functions; to their return address. As a consequence, we need a way to check loads that; occur after a misspeculated predicate but where the load and the misspeculated; predicate are in different functions.

Performance,"chedResult()``, but getting direct access to an outer level IR analysis; manager to compute an outer level IR analysis is not allowed. This is for a; couple reasons. The first reason is that running analyses across outer level IR in inner level; IR passes can result in quadratic compile time behavior. For example, a module; analysis often scans every function and allowing function passes to run a module; analysis may cause us to scan functions a quadratic number of times. If passes; could keep outer level analyses up to date rather than computing them on demand; this wouldn't be an issue, but that would be a lot of work to ensure every pass; updates all outer level analyses, and so far this hasn't been necessary and; there isn't infrastructure for this (aside from function analyses in loop passes; as described below). Self-updating analyses that gracefully degrade also handle; this problem (e.g. GlobalsAA), but they run into the issue of having to be; manually recomputed somewhere in the optimization pipeline if we want precision,; and they block potential future concurrency. The second reason is to keep in mind potential future pass concurrency, for; example parallelizing function passes over different functions in a CGSCC or; module. Since passes can ask for a cached analysis result, allowing passes to; trigger outer level analysis computation could result in non-determinism if; concurrency was supported. A related limitation is that outer level IR analyses; that are used must be immutable, or else they could be invalidated by changes to; inner level IR. Outer analyses unused by inner passes can and often will be; invalidated by changes to inner level IR. These invalidations happen after the; inner pass manager finishes, so accessing mutable analyses would give invalid; results.

This causes the global's address to be tagged when its address is; taken. * When the address of a global is taken directly (i.e. not via the GOT), a special; instruction sequence needs to be used to add the tag to the address,; because the tag would otherwise take the address outside of the small code; model (4GB on AArch64). No changes are required when the address is taken; via the GOT because the address stored in the GOT will contain the tag. * An associated ``hwasan_globals`` section is emitted for each tagged global,; which indicates the address of the global, its size and its tag.

Even; though this code pattern may still execute speculatively, *invalid* speculative; executions are prevented from leaking secret data from memory (but note that; this data might still be loaded in safe ways, and some regions of memory are; required to not hold secrets, see below for detailed limitations).

Performance,"cision to unroll the loop depends on the register pressure and the generated code size. Epilogue Vectorization; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When vectorizing a loop, often a scalar remainder (epilogue) loop is necessary; to execute tail iterations of the loop if the loop trip count is unknown or it; does not evenly divide the vectorization and unroll factors. When the; vectorization and unroll factors are large, it's possible for loops with smaller; trip counts to end up spending most of their time in the scalar (rather than; the vector) code. In order to address this issue, the inner loop vectorizer is; enhanced with a feature that allows it to vectorize epilogue loops with a; vectorization and unroll factor combination that makes it more likely for small; trip count loops to still execute in vectorized code. The diagram below shows; the CFG for a typical epilogue vectorized loop with runtime checks. As; illustrated the control flow is structured in a way that avoids duplicating the; runtime pointer checks and optimizes the path length for loops that have very; small trip counts. .. image:: epilogue-vectorization-cfg.png.

This; differs from Register and Indirect locations, because the runtime can; only read the values in those locations when execution reaches the; instruction address of the stack map. This functionality requires LLVM to treat entry-block allocas; specially when they are directly consumed by an intrinsics. (This is; the same requirement imposed by the llvm.gcroot intrinsic.)

Driver; The clang executable is actually a small driver which controls the overall; execution of other tools such as the compiler, assembler and linker.; Typically you do not need to interact with the driver, but you; transparently use it to run the other tools. Preprocessing; This stage handles tokenization of the input source file, macro expansion,; #include expansion and handling of other preprocessor directives. The; output of this stage is typically called a "".i"" (for C), "".ii"" (for C++),; "".mi"" (for Objective-C), or "".mii"" (for Objective-C++) file. Parsing and Semantic Analysis; This stage parses the input file, translating preprocessor tokens into a; parse tree. Once in the form of a parse tree, it applies semantic; analysis to compute types for expressions as well and determine whether; the code is well formed. This stage is responsible for generating most of; the compiler warnings as well as parse errors. The output of this stage is; an ""Abstract Syntax Tree"" (AST). Code Generation and Optimization; This stage translates an AST into low-level intermediate code (known as; ""LLVM IR"") and ultimately to machine code. This phase is responsible for; optimizing the generated code and handling target-specific code generation.; The output of this stage is typically called a "".s"" file or ""assembly"" file. Clang also supports the use of an integrated assembler, in which the code; generator pr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/CommandGuide/clang.rst:293,optimiz,optimization,293,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/CommandGuide/clang.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/CommandGuide/clang.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Dictionaries; ------------. Loading header files or code directly into ``cling`` is fine for interactive; work and smaller packages, but large scale applications benefit from; pre-compiling code, using the automatic class loader, and packaging; dependencies in so-called ""dictionaries."". A `dictionary` is a generated C++ source file containing references to the; header locations used when building (and any additional locations provided),; a set of forward declarations to reduce the need of loading header files, and; a few I/O helper functions.; The name ""dictionary"" is historic: before ``cling`` was used, it contained; the complete generated C++ reflection information, whereas now that is; derived at run-time from the header files.; It is still possible to fully embed header files rather than only storing; their names and search locations, to make the dictionary more self-contained. After generating the dictionary, it should be compiled into a shared library.; This provides additional dependency control: by linking it directly with any; further libraries needed, you can use standard mechanisms such as ``rpath``; to locate those library dependencies.; Alternatively, you can add the additional libraries to load to the mapping; files of the class loader (see below). .. note::.

This way, a single directory containing multiple variants of modules can be prepared and reused. The options configuring the module cache are independent of other options. Module Semantics; ================. Modules are modeled as if each submodule were a separate translation unit, and a module import makes names from the other translation unit visible. Each submodule starts with a new preprocessor state and an empty translation unit. .. note::. This behavior is currently only approximated when building a module with submodules. Entities within a submodule that has already been built are visible when building later submodules in that module. This can lead to fragile modules that depend on the build order used for the submodules of the module, and should not be relied upon. This behavior is subject to change.

Performance,"code (using the binary representation expected by the; runtime library). This can be accomplished in about 100 lines of code. This is not the appropriate place to implement a garbage collected heap or a; garbage collector itself. That code should exist in the language's runtime; library. The compiler plugin is responsible for generating code which conforms; to the binary interface defined by library, most essentially the :ref:`stack map; <stack-map>`. To subclass ``llvm::GCStrategy`` and register it with the compiler:. .. code-block:: c++. // lib/MyGC/MyGC.cpp - Example LLVM GC plugin. #include ""llvm/CodeGen/GCStrategy.h""; #include ""llvm/CodeGen/GCMetadata.h""; #include ""llvm/Support/Compiler.h"". using namespace llvm;. namespace {; class LLVM_LIBRARY_VISIBILITY MyGC : public GCStrategy {; public:; MyGC() {}; };. GCRegistry::Add<MyGC>; X(""mygc"", ""My bespoke garbage collector."");; }. This boilerplate collector does nothing. More specifically:. * ``llvm.gcread`` calls are replaced with the corresponding ``load``; instruction. * ``llvm.gcwrite`` calls are replaced with the corresponding ``store``; instruction. * No safe points are added to the code. * The stack map is not compiled into the executable. Using the LLVM makefiles, this code; can be compiled as a plugin using a simple makefile:. .. code-block:: make. # lib/MyGC/Makefile. LEVEL := ../..; LIBRARYNAME = MyGC; LOADABLE_MODULE = 1. include $(LEVEL)/Makefile.common. Once the plugin is compiled, code using it may be compiled using ``llc; -load=MyGC.so`` (though MyGC.so may have some other platform-specific; extension):. ::. $ cat sample.ll; define void @f() gc ""mygc"" {; entry:; ret void; }; $ llvm-as < sample.ll | llc -load=MyGC.so.

Performance,"code file. The linker completes its usual; symbol resolution pass and finds that ``foo2()`` is not used; anywhere. This information is used by the LLVM optimizer and it; removes ``foo2()``. * As soon as ``foo2()`` is removed, the optimizer recognizes that condition ``i; < 0`` is always false, which means ``foo3()`` is never used. Hence, the; optimizer also removes ``foo3()``. * And this in turn, enables linker to remove ``foo4()``. This example illustrates the advantage of tight integration with the; linker. Here, the optimizer can not remove ``foo3()`` without the linker's; input. Alternative Approaches; ----------------------. **Compiler driver invokes link time optimizer separately.**; In this model the link time optimizer is not able to take advantage of; information collected during the linker's normal symbol resolution phase.; In the above example, the optimizer can not remove ``foo2()`` without the; linker's input because it is externally visible. This in turn prohibits the; optimizer from removing ``foo3()``. **Use separate tool to collect symbol information from all object files.**; In this model, a new, separate, tool or library replicates the linker's; capability to collect information for link time optimization. Not only is; this code duplication difficult to justify, but it also has several other; disadvantages. For example, the linking semantics and the features provided; by the linker on various platform are not unique. This means, this new tool; needs to support all such features and platforms in one super tool or a; separate tool per platform is required. This increases maintenance cost for; link time optimizer significantly, which is not necessary. This approach; also requires staying synchronized with linker developments on various; platforms, which is not the main focus of the link time optimizer. Finally,; this approach increases end user's build time due to the duplication of work; done by this separate tool and the linker itself.

When `TSystem::Load(""ALib"")` is called, ROOT uses this information to; determine which libraries `libALib.so` depends on. It will load these; libraries first.

It's inadvisable to store raw profiles for; long periods of time. * Tools must retain **backwards** compatibility with indexed profile formats.; These formats are not forwards-compatible: i.e, a tool which uses format; version X will not be able to understand format version (X+k). * Tools must also retain **backwards** compatibility with the format of the; coverage mappings emitted into instrumented binaries. These formats are not; forwards-compatible. * The JSON coverage export format has a (major, minor, patch) version triple.; Only a major version increment indicates a backwards-incompatible change. A; minor version increment is for added functionality, and patch version; increments are for bugfixes. Impact of llvm optimizations on coverage reports; ================================================. llvm optimizations (such as inlining or CFG simplification) should have no; impact on coverage report quality. This is due to the fact that the mapping; from source regions to profile counters is immutable, and is generated before; the llvm optimizer kicks in. The optimizer can't prove that profile counter; instrumentation is safe to delete (because it's not: it affects the profile the; program emits), and so leaves it alone. Note that this coverage feature does not rely on information that can degrade; during the course of optimization, such as debug info line tables.

Debug information is a hard problem for a few different reasons - mostly; centered around optimized code. First, optimization makes keeping source; locations more difficult. In LLVM IR we keep the original source location; for each IR level instruction on the instruction. Optimization passes; should keep the source locations for newly created instructions, but merged; instructions only get to keep a single location - this can cause jumping; around when stepping through optimized programs. Secondly, optimization; can move variables in ways that are either optimized out, shared in memory; with other variables, or difficult to track.

Performance,"completely fleshed out.; Currently, ROOT objects and built-in types can cross the boundary; between the two interpreters, but other objects are much more; restricted. For example, for a Python object to cross, it has to be a; class instance, and its class has to be known to Cling first (i.e. the; class has to cross first, before the instance can). All other; cross-coding is based on strings that are run on the Python interpreter; and vise-versa. With the ROOT v4.00/06 and later, the **`TPython`** class will be loaded; automatically on use, for older editions, the `libPyROOT.so` needs to be; loaded first before use. It is possible to switch between interpreters; by calling **`TPython::Prompt()`** on the ROOT side, while returning with; `^D` (`EOF`). State is preserved between successive switches, and string; based cross calls can nest as long as shared resources are properly; handled. ``` {.cpp}; // Example: accessing the Python interpreter from ROOT; // either load PyROOT explicitly or rely on auto-loading; root[] gSystem->Load( ""libPyROOT"" );; root[] TPython::Exec(""print1+1"");; 2. // create a TBrowser on the Python side, and transfer it back and forth; root[] TBrowser* b = (void*)TPython::Eval(""ROOT.TBrowser()"");; (class TObject*)0x8d1daa0; root[] TPython::Bind(b,""b"");. // builtin variables can cross-over (after the call i==2); root[] int i = TPython::Eval( ""1+1"" );; root[] i; (int)2; ```. ### Installation. There are several ways of obtaining `PyROOT`, and which is best depends; on your specific situation. If you work at CERN, you can use the; installation available on `afs`. Otherwise, you will want to build from; source, as `PyROOT` is not build by default in the binaries distributed; from the ROOT project site.

Performance,"completion of a send of ``release`` that is not; preceded by a send of ``retain`` to the same object. The behavior of ``autorelease`` must be equivalent to sending ``release`` when; one of the autorelease pools currently in scope is popped. It may not throw an; exception. When the semantics call for performing one of these operations on a retainable; object pointer, if that pointer is ``null`` then the effect is a no-op. All of the semantics described in this document are subject to additional; :ref:`optimization rules <arc.optimization>` which permit the removal or; optimization of operations based on local knowledge of data flow. The; semantics describe the high-level behaviors that the compiler implements, not; an exact sequence of operations that a program will be compiled into. .. _arc.objects.operands:. Retainable object pointers as operands and arguments; ----------------------------------------------------. In general, ARC does not perform retain or release operations when simply using; a retainable object pointer as an operand within an expression. This includes:. * loading a retainable pointer from an object with non-weak :ref:`ownership; <arc.ownership>`,; * passing a retainable pointer as an argument to a function or method, and; * receiving a retainable pointer as the result of a function or method call. .. admonition:: Rationale. While this might seem uncontroversial, it is actually unsafe when multiple; expressions are evaluated in ""parallel"", as with binary operators and calls,; because (for example) one expression might load from an object while another; writes to it. However, C and C++ already call this undefined behavior; because the evaluations are unsequenced, and ARC simply exploits that here to; avoid needing to retain arguments across a large number of calls. The remainder of this section describes exceptions to these rules, how those; exceptions are detected, and what those exceptions imply semantically. .. _arc.objects.operands.consumed:.

Performance,"complexity of inserting bitcasts everywhere that they might be; required. The community consensus is that the costs of pointee types; outweight the benefits, and that they should be removed. Many operations do not actually care about the underlying type. These; operations, typically intrinsics, usually end up taking an arbitrary pointer; type ``i8*`` and sometimes a size. This causes lots of redundant no-op bitcasts; in the IR to and from a pointer with a different pointee type. No-op bitcasts take up memory/disk space and also take up compile time to look; through. However, perhaps the biggest issue is the code complexity required to; deal with bitcasts. When looking up through def-use chains for pointers it's; easy to forget to call `Value::stripPointerCasts()` to find the true underlying; pointer obfuscated by bitcasts. And when looking down through def-use chains; passes need to iterate through bitcasts to handle uses. Removing no-op pointer; bitcasts prevents a category of missed optimizations and makes writing LLVM; passes a little bit easier. Fewer no-op pointer bitcasts also reduces the chances of incorrect bitcasts in; regards to address spaces. People maintaining backends that care a lot about; address spaces have complained that frontends like Clang often incorrectly; bitcast pointers, losing address space information. An analogous transition that happened earlier in LLVM is integer signedness.; Currently there is no distinction between signed and unsigned integer types, but; rather each integer operation (e.g. add) contains flags to signal how to treat; the integer. Previously LLVM IR distinguished between unsigned and signed; integer types and ran into similar issues of no-op casts. The transition from; manifesting signedness in types to instructions happened early on in LLVM's; timeline to make LLVM easier to work with. Opaque Pointers Mode; ====================.

FatLTO objects are a special type of `fat object file; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_binary>`_ that contain LTO compatible IR in; addition to generated object code, instead of containing object code for; multiple target architectures. This allows users to defer the choice of whether; to use LTO or not to link-time, and has been a feature available in other; compilers, like `GCC; <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/LTO-Overview.html>`_, for some time. Under FatLTO the compiler can emit standard object files which contain both the; machine code in the ``.text`` section and LLVM bitcode in the ``.llvm.lto``; section. Overview; ========. Within LLVM, FatLTO is supported by choosing the ``FatLTODefaultPipeline``.; This pipeline will:. #) Run the pre-link (Thin)LTO pipeline on the current module.; #) Embed the pre-link bitcode in a special ``.llvm.lto`` section.; #) Finish optimizing the module using the ModuleOptimization pipeline.; #) Emit the object file, including the new ``.llvm.lto`` section. .. NOTE. Previously, we conservatively ran independent pipelines on separate copies; of the LLVM module to generate the bitcode section and the object code,; which happen to be identical to those used outside of FatLTO. While that; resulted in compiled artifacts that were identical to those produced by the; default and (Thin)LTO pipelines, module cloning led to some cases of; miscompilation, and we have moved away from trying to keep bitcode; generation and optimization completely disjoint. Bit-for-bit compatibility is not (and never was) a guarantee, and we reserve; the right to change this at any time. Explicitly, users should not rely on; the produced bitcode or object code to match their non-LTO counterparts; precisely. They will exhibit similar performance characteristics, but may; not be bit-for-bit the same.

Performance,"conversions are extended as follows. Note that these conversions; are intentionally not listed as satisfying the constraints for assignment,; which is to say, they are only permitted as explicit casts, not as implicit; conversions. A value of matrix type can be converted to another matrix type if the number of; rows and columns are the same and the value's elements can be converted to the; element type of the result type. The result is a matrix where each element is; the converted corresponding element. A value of any real type (as in C23 6.2.5p14) can be converted to a matrix type; if it can be converted to the element type of the matrix. The result is a; matrix where all elements are the converted original value. If the number of rows or columns differ between the original and resulting; type, the program is ill-formed. Arithmetic Conversions; ----------------------. The usual arithmetic conversions are extended as follows. Insert at the start:. * If both operands are of matrix type, no arithmetic conversion is performed.; * If one operand is of matrix type and the other operand is of a real type,; convert the real type operand to the matrix type; according to the standard conversion rules. Matrix Type Element Access Operator; -----------------------------------. An expression of the form ``E1 [E2] [E3]``, where ``E1`` has matrix type ``cv; M``, is a matrix element access expression. Let ``T`` be the element type; of ``M``, and let ``R`` and ``C`` be the number of rows and columns in ``M``; respectively.

Other potential applications of bounds annotations; ==================================================. The bounds annotations provided by the ``-fbounds-safety`` programming model; have potential use cases beyond the language extension itself. For example,; static and dynamic analysis tools could use the bounds information to improve; diagnostics for out-of-bounds accesses, even if ``-fbounds-safety`` is not used.; The bounds annotations could be used to improve C interoperability with; bounds-safe languages, providing a better mapping to bounds-safe types in the; safe language interface. The bounds annotations can also serve as documentation; specifying the relationship between declarations. Limitations; ===========. ``-fbounds-safety`` aims to bring the bounds safety guarantee to the C language,; and it does not guarantee other types of memory safety properties. Consequently,; it may not prevent some of the secondary bounds safety violations caused by; other types of safety violations such as type confusion. For instance,; ``-fbounds-safety`` does not perform type-safety checks on conversions between; `__single`` pointers of different pointee types (e.g., ``char *__single`` →; ``void *__single`` → ``int *__single``) beyond what the foundation languages; (C/C++) already offer. ``-fbounds-safety`` heavily relies on run-time checks to keep the bounds safety; and the soundness of the type system. This may incur significant code size; overhead in unoptimized builds and leaving some of the adoption mistakes to be; caught only at run time. This is not a fundamental limitation, however, because; incrementally adding necessary static analysis will allow us to catch issues; early on and remove unnecessary bounds checks in unoptimized builds.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:47511,perform,perform,47511,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['perform'],['perform']

Performance,"cremental compiles. In ThinLTO mode, as with regular LTO, clang emits LLVM bitcode after the; compile phase. The ThinLTO bitcode is augmented with a compact summary; of the module. During the link step, only the summaries are read and; merged into a combined summary index, which includes an index of function; locations for later cross-module function importing. Fast and efficient; whole-program analysis is then performed on the combined summary index. However, all transformations, including function importing, occur; later when the modules are optimized in fully parallel backends.; By default, linkers_ that support ThinLTO are set up to launch; the ThinLTO backends in threads. So the usage model is not affected; as the distinction between the fast serial thin link step and the backends; is transparent to the user.

CMake Caches; ============. Recently LLVM and Clang have been adding some more complicated build system; features. Utilizing these new features often involves a complicated chain of; CMake variables passed on the command line. Clang provides a collection of CMake; cache scripts to make these features more approachable. CMake cache files are utilized using CMake's -C flag:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -C <path to cache file> <path to sources>. CMake cache scripts are processed in an isolated scope, only cached variables; remain set when the main configuration runs. CMake cached variables do not reset; variables that are already set unless the FORCE option is specified. A few notes about CMake Caches:. - Order of command line arguments is important. - -D arguments specified before -C are set before the cache is processed and; can be read inside the cache file; - -D arguments specified after -C are set after the cache is processed and; are unset inside the cache file. - All -D arguments will override cache file settings; - CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE is evaluated after both the cache file and the command; line arguments; - It is recommended that all -D options should be specified *before* -C.

For existing flat volume; structures, one can define assemblies to force a hierarchical structure; therefore optimizing the performance. Usage of assemblies does NOT imply; penalties in performance, but in some cases, it can be observed that it; is not as performing as bounding the structure in a container volume; with a simple shape.

All geometrical transformations handled by the modeller are provided as; a built-in package. This was designed to minimize memory requirements; and optimize performance of point/vector master-to-local and; local-to-master computation. We need to have in mind that a; transformation in **`TGeo`** has two major use-cases. The first one is; for defining the placement of a volume with respect to its container; reference frame. This frame will be called 'master' and the frame of the; positioned volume - 'local'. If `T` is a transformation used for; positioning volume daughters, then: `MASTER = T * LOCAL`. Therefore `T `is used to perform a local to master conversion, while; `T-1` for a master to local conversion. The second use case is the; computation of the global transformation of a given object in the; geometry. Since the geometry is built as 'volumes-inside-volumes', the; global transformation represents the pile-up of all local; transformations in the corresponding branch. Once a given object in the; hierarchy becomes the current one, the conversion from master to local; coordinates or the other way around can be done from the manager class.

Performance,"ct control flow edge (or it cannot be mispredicted in; the case of a filled RSB) and so it is also protected from variant #1 style; attacks. However, some architectures, micro-architectures, or vendors do not; employ the retpoline mitigation, and on future x86 hardware (both Intel and; AMD) it is expected to become unnecessary due to hardware-based mitigation. When not using a retpoline, these edges will need independent protection from; variant #1 style attacks. The analogous approach to that used for conditional; control flow should work:; ```; uintptr_t all_ones_mask = std::numerical_limits<uintptr_t>::max();; uintptr_t all_zeros_mask = 0;; void leak(int data);; void example(int* pointer1, int* pointer2) {; uintptr_t predicate_state = all_ones_mask;; switch (condition) {; case 0:; // Assuming ?: is implemented using branchless logic...; predicate_state = (condition != 0) ? all_zeros_mask : predicate_state;; // ... lots of code ...; //; // Harden the pointer so it can't be loaded; pointer1 &= predicate_state;; leak(*pointer1);; break;. case 1:; predicate_state = (condition != 1) ? all_zeros_mask : predicate_state;; // ... more code ...; //; // Alternative: Harden the loaded value; int value2 = *pointer2 & predicate_state;; leak(value2);; break;. // ...; }; }; ```. The core idea remains the same: validate the control flow using data-flow and; use that validation to check that loads cannot leak information along; misspeculated paths. Typically this involves passing the desired target of such; control flow across the edge and checking that it is correct afterwards. Note; that while it is tempting to think that this mitigates variant #2 attacks, it; does not. Those attacks go to arbitrary gadgets that don't include the checks. ### Variant #1.1 and #1.2 attacks: ""Bounds Check Bypass Store"".

TVirtualViewer3D provides for two methods of object addition:. ``` {.cpp}; virtual Int_t AddObject(const TBuffer3D &buffer,; Bool_t * addChildren = 0); virtual Int_t AddObject(UInt_t physicalID,; const TBuffer3D & buffer,; Bool_t *addChildren = 0); ```. If you use the first (simple) case a viewer using logical/physical pairs; will generate sequential IDs for each physical object internally. Scene; rebuilds will require destruction and recreation of all physical; objects. For the second you can specify an identifier from the client; side, which must be unique and stable - i.e. the IDs of a published; object is consistent, regardless of changes in termination of contained; child geometry branches. In this case the viewer can safely cache the; physical objects across scene rebuilds, discarding those no longer of; interest. #### Child Objects. In many geometries there is a rigid containment hierarchy, and so if the; viewer is not interested in a certain object due to limits/size then it; will also not be interest in any of the contained branch of siblings.; Both `TBuffer3D::AddObject()` methods have an `addChildren` return; parameter. The viewer will complete this (if passed) indicating if; children of the object just sent are worth sending. #### Recycling TBuffer3D. Once add `TBuffer3D::AddObject()` has been called, the contents are; copied to the viewer's internal data structures. You are free to destroy; this **`TBuffer3D`**, or recycle it for the next object if suitable. #### Examples. For an example of a simple geometry, working in master reference frame; examine the code under `$ROOTSYS/g3d`. For a more complex example, which; works in both master and local frames, and uses logical`/`physical; division of shape geometry and placement, examine the code under; `$ROOTSYS/geom` - in particular **`TGeoShape`** hierarchy, and the; painter object **`TGeoPainter`** (under geopainter) where the; negotiation with the viewer is performed.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md:139508,perform,performed,139508,documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,1,['perform'],['performed']

In general, the analyzer attempts to inline as much as possible, since it; provides a better summary of what actually happens in the program. There are; some cases, however, where the analyzer chooses not to inline:. - If there is no definition available for the called function or method. In; this case, there is no opportunity to inline. - If the CFG cannot be constructed for a called function, or the liveness; cannot be computed. These are prerequisites for analyzing a function body,; with or without inlining. - If the LocationContext chain for a given ExplodedNode reaches a maximum cutoff; depth. This prevents unbounded analysis due to infinite recursion, but also; serves as a useful cutoff for performance reasons. - If the function is variadic. This is not a hard limitation, but an engineering; limitation. Tracked by: <rdar://problem/12147064> Support inlining of variadic functions. - In C++, constructors are not inlined unless the destructor call will be; processed by the ExprEngine. Thus, if the CFG was built without nodes for; implicit destructors, or if the destructors for the given object are not; represented in the CFG, the constructor will not be inlined. (As an exception,; constructors for objects with trivial constructors can still be inlined.); See ""C++ Caveats"" below. - In C++, ExprEngine does not inline custom implementations of operator 'new'; or operator 'delete', nor does it inline the constructors and destructors; associated with these.

Performance,"ctices and general; information about packaging LLVM. If you are new to CMake you may find the :doc:`CMake` or :doc:`CMakePrimer`; documentation useful. Some of the things covered in this document are the inner; workings of the builds described in the :doc:`AdvancedBuilds` document. General Distribution Guidance; =============================. When building a distribution of a compiler it is generally advised to perform a; bootstrap build of the compiler. That means building a ""stage 1"" compiler with; your host toolchain, then building the ""stage 2"" compiler using the ""stage 1""; compiler. This is done so that the compiler you distribute benefits from all the; bug fixes, performance optimizations and general improvements provided by the; new compiler. In deciding how to build your distribution there are a few trade-offs that you; will need to evaluate. The big two are:. #. Compile time of the distribution against performance of the built compiler. #. Binary size of the distribution against performance of the built compiler. The guidance for maximizing performance of the generated compiler is to use LTO,; PGO, and statically link everything. This will result in an overall larger; distribution, and it will take longer to generate, but it provides the most; opportunity for the compiler to optimize. The guidance for minimizing distribution size is to dynamically link LLVM and; Clang libraries into the tools to reduce code duplication. This will come at a; substantial performance penalty to the generated binary both because it reduces; optimization opportunity, and because dynamic linking requires resolving symbols; at process launch time, which can be very slow for C++ code. .. _shared_libs:. .. warning::; One very important note: Distributions should never be built using the; *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake option. That option exists for optimizing developer; workflow only.

The addresses of :ref:`global variables <globalvars>` and; :ref:`functions <functionstructure>` are always implicitly valid; (link-time) constants. These constants are explicitly referenced when; the :ref:`identifier for the global <identifiers>` is used and always have; :ref:`pointer <t_pointer>` type. For example, the following is a legal LLVM; file:. .. code-block:: llvm. @X = global i32 17; @Y = global i32 42; @Z = global [2 x ptr] [ ptr @X, ptr @Y ]. .. _undefvalues:. Undefined Values; ----------------. The string '``undef``' can be used anywhere a constant is expected, and; indicates that the user of the value may receive an unspecified; bit-pattern. Undefined values may be of any type (other than '``label``'; or '``void``') and be used anywhere a constant is permitted. .. note::. A '``poison``' value (described in the next section) should be used instead of; '``undef``' whenever possible. Poison values are stronger than undef, and; enable more optimizations. Just the existence of '``undef``' blocks certain; optimizations (see the examples below). Undefined values are useful because they indicate to the compiler that; the program is well defined no matter what value is used. This gives the; compiler more freedom to optimize.

The ``-print-alias-sets`` pass is exposed as part of the ``opt`` tool to print; out the Alias Sets formed by the `AliasSetTracker`_ class.

The SelectionDAG provides an abstraction for code representation in a way that; is amenable to instruction selection using automatic techniques; (e.g. dynamic-programming based optimal pattern matching selectors).

The SelectionDAG is a Directed-Acyclic-Graph whose nodes are instances of the; ``SDNode`` class. The primary payload of the ``SDNode`` is its operation code; (Opcode) that indicates what operation the node performs and the operands to the; operation. The various operation node types are described at the top of the; ``include/llvm/CodeGen/ISDOpcodes.h`` file. Although most operations define a single value, each node in the graph may; define multiple values. For example, a combined div/rem operation will define; both the dividend and the remainder. Many other situations require multiple; values as well. Each node also has some number of operands, which are edges to; the node defining the used value.

Therefore, the vector and; scalar memory operations performed by wavefronts executing in different; work-groups (which may be executing on different CUs) of an agent can be; reordered relative to each other. A ``s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)`` is required to; ensure synchronization between vector memory operations of different CUs. It; ensures a previous vector memory operation has completed before executing a; subsequent vector memory or LDS operation and so can be used to meet the; requirements of acquire and release.; * The L2 cache can be kept coherent with other agents on some targets, or ranges; of virtual addresses can be set up to bypass it to ensure system coherence. Scalar memory operations are only used to access memory that is proven to not; change during the execution of the kernel dispatch. This includes constant; address space and global address space for program scope ``const`` variables.; Therefore, the kernel machine code does not have to maintain the scalar cache to; ensure it is coherent with the vector caches. The scalar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be us",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUUsage.rst:209137,cache,cache,209137,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUUsage.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUUsage.rst,1,['cache'],['cache']

Prior to the existence of the Legalize passes, we required that every target; `selector`_ supported and handled every operator and type even if they are not; natively supported. The introduction of the Legalize phases allows all of the; canonicalization patterns to be shared across targets, and makes it very easy to; optimize the canonicalized code because it is still in the form of a DAG. .. _optimizations:; .. _Optimize SelectionDAG:; .. _selector:.

The SelectionDAG optimization phase is run multiple times for code generation,; immediately after the DAG is built and once after each legalization. The first; run of the pass allows the initial code to be cleaned up (e.g. performing; optimizations that depend on knowing that the operators have restricted type; inputs). Subsequent runs of the pass clean up the messy code generated by the; Legalize passes, which allows Legalize to be very simple (it can focus on making; code legal instead of focusing on generating *good* and legal code).

Performance,"ctor of RooFit objects using a loop, you don't; have to think about indexing them properly because the `beginLoop()` function; takes care of that. Simply call this function, place your function call in a; scope and after the scope ends, the loop will also end. - `addToCodeBody()` helps add things to the body of the C++ function that; you're creating. It takes whatever string is computed in its arguments and; adds it to the overall function string (which will later be just-in-time; compiled). The `addToCodeBody()` function is important since not everything; can be added in-line and this function helps split the code into multiple; lines. ### Step 3. analyticalIntegral() Use Case. > Besides the `evaluate()` function, this tutorial illustrates how the; `analyticalIntegral()` can be updated. This highly dependent on the class that; is being transformed for AD support, but will be necessary in those specific; instances. Let's consider a fictional class RooFoo, that performs some arbitrary; mathematical operations called 'Foo' (as seen in doFoo() function below). > Note that doFoo is a simplified example, in many cases the mathematical; operations are not limited to a single function, so they need to be spotted; within the `evaluate()` function. ``` {.cpp}; class RooFoo : public RooAbsReal {; int a;; int b;; int doFoo() { return a* b + a + b; }; int integralFoo() { return /* whatever */;}; public:; // Other functions...; double evaluate() override {; // Do some bookkeeping; return doFoo();; };; double analyticalIntegral(Int_t code, const char* rangeName) override {; // Select the right paths for integration using codes or whatever.; return integralFoo();; }; };; ```. \note All RooFit classes are deriving from the RooAbsReal object, but; its details are not relevant to the current example. Note how the `evaluate()` function overrides the `RooAbsReal` for the RooFoo; class. Similarly, the `analyticalIntegral()` function has also been overridden; from the `RooAbsReal` class.

Performance,"d AST file (one per module) and use those AST; modules. From an implementation standpoint, modules are a generalization of; precompiled headers, lifting a number of restrictions placed on precompiled; headers. In particular, there can only be one precompiled header and it must; be included at the beginning of the translation unit. The extensions to the; AST file format required for modules are discussed in the section on; :ref:`modules <pchinternals-modules>`. Clang's AST files are designed with a compact on-disk representation, which; minimizes both creation time and the time required to initially load the AST; file. The AST file itself contains a serialized representation of Clang's; abstract syntax trees and supporting data structures, stored using the same; compressed bitstream as `LLVM's bitcode file format; <https://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html>`_. Clang's AST files are loaded ""lazily"" from disk. When an AST file is initially; loaded, Clang reads only a small amount of data from the AST file to establish; where certain important data structures are stored. The amount of data read in; this initial load is independent of the size of the AST file, such that a; larger AST file does not lead to longer AST load times. The actual header data; in the AST file --- macros, functions, variables, types, etc. --- is loaded; only when it is referenced from the user's code, at which point only that; entity (and those entities it depends on) are deserialized from the AST file.; With this approach, the cost of using an AST file for a translation unit is; proportional to the amount of code actually used from the AST file, rather than; being proportional to the size of the AST file itself. When given the `-print-stats` option, Clang produces statistics; describing how much of the AST file was actually loaded from disk. For a; simple ""Hello, World!"" program that includes the Apple ``Cocoa.h`` header; (which is built as a precompiled header), this option illustrates how little ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst:3469,load,loaded,3469,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,1,['load'],['loaded']

Performance,"d Surface at Crossing Point. Supposing we have found out that a particle will cross a boundary during; the next step, it is sometimes useful to compute the normal to the; crossed surface. The modeller uses the following convention: we define; as `normal` ($\vec{n}$) the unit vector perpendicular; to a surface in the `next crossing point`, having the orientation such; that: $\vec{n}.\vec{d}>0$. Here $\vec{d}$; represents the current direction. The next crossing point represents the; point where a ray shot from the current point along the current; direction crosses the surface. ``` {.cpp}; Double_t *TGeoManager::FindNormal(Bool_t forward=kTRUE);; ```. The method above computes the normal to the next crossed surface in; forward or backward direction (i.e. the current one), assuming the state; corresponding to a current arbitrary point is initialized. An example of; usage of normal computation is ray tracing. The two most important features of the geometrical modeller concerning; tracking are scalability and performance as function of the total number; of physical nodes. The first refers to the possibility to make use of; the available memory resources and at the same time be able to resolve; any geometrical query, while the second defines the capability of the; modeller to respond quickly even for huge geometries. These parameters; can become critical when simulating big experiments like those at LHC. ### Creating and Visualizing Tracks. In case the modeller is interfaced with a tracking engine, one might; consider quite useful being able to store and visualize at least a part; of the tracks in the context of the geometry. The base class; **`TVirtualGeoTrack`** provides this functionality. It currently has one; implementation inside the drawing package (**`TGeoTrack`** class). A; track can be defined like:. ``` {.cpp}; TVirtualGeoTrack(Int_t id,Int_t pdg,TVirtualGeoTrack *parent=0,; TObject *particle=0);; ```.

However, it is; insufficiently simple to be salvaged, and is emitted as a ``$noreg``; DBG_VALUE, indicating that the variable takes on an undefined location.; * The final dbg.value has its Value placed in virtual register ``%1``. Instruction Scheduling; ----------------------. A number of passes can reschedule instructions, notably instruction selection; and the pre-and-post RA machine schedulers. Instruction scheduling can; significantly change the nature of the program -- in the (very unlikely) worst; case the instruction sequence could be completely reversed. In such; circumstances LLVM follows the principle applied to optimizations, that it is; better for the debugger not to display any state than a misleading state.; Thus, whenever instructions are advanced in order of execution, any; corresponding DBG_VALUE is kept in its original position, and if an instruction; is delayed then the variable is given an undefined location for the duration; of the delay. To illustrate, consider this pseudo-MIR:. .. code-block:: text. %1:gr32 = MOV32rm %0, 1, $noreg, 4, $noreg, debug-location !5 :: (load 4 from %ir.addr1); DBG_VALUE %1, $noreg, !1, !2; %4:gr32 = ADD32rr %3, %2, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %4, $noreg, !3, !4; %7:gr32 = SUB32rr %6, %5, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %7, $noreg, !5, !6. Imagine that the SUB32rr were moved forward to give us the following MIR:. .. code-block:: text. %7:gr32 = SUB32rr %6, %5, implicit-def dead $eflags; %1:gr32 = MOV32rm %0, 1, $noreg, 4, $noreg, debug-location !5 :: (load 4 from %ir.addr1); DBG_VALUE %1, $noreg, !1, !2; %4:gr32 = ADD32rr %3, %2, implicit-def dead $eflags; DB",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:33044,optimiz,optimizations,33044,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']

Alternatively, ``-debug-only=isel-dump`` shows only; the DAG dumps, but the results can be filtered by function names using; ``-filter-print-funcs=<function names>``. One great way to visualize what is going on here is to take advantage of a few; LLC command line options. The following options pop up a window displaying the; SelectionDAG at specific times (if you only get errors printed to the console; while using this, you probably `need to configure your; system <ProgrammersManual.html#viewing-graphs-while-debugging-code>`_ to add support for it). * ``-view-dag-combine1-dags`` displays the DAG after being built, before the; first optimization pass. * ``-view-legalize-dags`` displays the DAG before Legalization. * ``-view-dag-combine2-dags`` displays the DAG before the second optimization; pass. * ``-view-isel-dags`` displays the DAG before the Select phase. * ``-view-sched-dags`` displays the DAG before Scheduling.

This graph; is based on the final SelectionDAG, with nodes that must be scheduled together; bundled into a single scheduling-unit node, and with immediate operands and; other nodes that aren't relevant for scheduling omitted.

When a ``PHI`` node is encountered, only the definition is; handled, because the uses will be handled in other basic blocks. For each ``PHI`` node of the current basic block, we simulate an assignment at; the end of the current basic block and traverse the successor basic blocks. If a; successor basic block has a ``PHI`` node and one of the ``PHI`` node's operands; is coming from the current basic block, then the variable is marked as *alive*; within the current basic block and all of its predecessor basic blocks, until; the basic block with the defining instruction is encountered. Live Intervals Analysis; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. We now have the information available to perform the live intervals analysis and; build the live intervals themselves. We start off by numbering the basic blocks; and machine instructions. We then handle the ""live-in"" values. These are in; physical registers, so the physical register is assumed to be killed by the end; of the basic block.

Performance,"d by using `psyco`, see the next link:; <http://psyco.sourceforge.net>, a Python just in time compiler (JIT).; Note, however, that `psyco` is limited to Intel i386 CPUs. Since `psyco`; optimizes Python, not `PyROOT` calls; it generally does not improve; performance that much if most of your code consists of ROOT API calls.; Mathematical computations in Python, on the other hand, benefit a lot. Every call to a Python member function results in a lookup of that; member function and an association of this method with `'self'`.; Furthermore, a temporary object is created during this process that is; discarded after the method call. In inner loops, it may be worth your; while (up to 30%), to short-cut this process by looking up and binding; the method before the loop, and discarding it afterwards. Here is an; example:. ``` {.cpp}; hpx = TH1F('hpx','px',100,-4,4); hpxFill = hpx.Fill # cache bound method; for i in xrange(25000):; px = gRandom.Gaus(); hpxFill(px) # use bound method: no lookup needed; del hpxFill # done with cached method; ```. Note that if you do not discard the bound method, a reference to the; histogram will remain outstanding, and it will not be deleted when it; should be. It is therefore important to delete the method when you're; done with it. ### Use of Python Functions. It is possible to mix Python functions with ROOT and perform such; operations as plotting and fitting of histograms with them. In all; cases, the procedure consists of instantiating a ROOT **`TF1`**,; **`TF2`**, or **`TF3`** with the Python function and working with that; ROOT object. There are some memory issues, so it is for example not yet; possible to delete a **`TF1`** instance and then create another one with; the same name. In addition, the Python function, once used for; instantiating the **`TF1`**, is never deleted. Instead of a Python function, you can also use callable instances (e.g.,; an instance of a class that has implemented the `__call__` member; function).

Performance,"d check the type in C++, or duplicate the; pattern. GICombineRule; -------------. MIR patterns can appear in the ``match`` or ``apply`` patterns of a; ``GICombineRule``. The ``root`` of the rule can either be a def of an instruction, or a; named pattern. The latter is helpful when the instruction you want; to match has no defs. The former is generally preferred because; it's less verbose. .. code-block:: text; :caption: Combine Rule root is a def. // Fold x op 1 -> x; def right_identity_one: GICombineRule<; (defs root:$dst),; (match (G_MUL $dst, $x, 1)),; // Note: Patterns always need to create something, we can't just replace $dst with $x, so we need a COPY.; (apply (COPY $dst, $x)); >;. .. code-block:: text; :caption: Combine Rule root is a named pattern. def Foo : GICombineRule<; (defs root:$root),; (match (G_ZEXT $tmp, (i32 0)),; (G_STORE $tmp, $ptr):$root),; (apply (G_STORE (i32 0), $ptr):$root)>;. Combine Rules also allow mixing C++ code with MIR patterns, so that you; may perform additional checks when matching, or run additional code after; rewriting a pattern. The following expansions are available for MIR patterns:. * operand names (``MachineOperand &``); * pattern names (``MachineInstr *`` for ``match``,; ``MachineInstrBuilder &`` for apply). .. code-block:: text; :caption: Example C++ Expansions. def Foo : GICombineRule<; (defs root:$root),; (match (G_ZEXT $root, $src):$mi),; (apply ""foobar(${root}.getReg(), ${src}.getReg(), ${mi}->hasImplicitDef())"")>;. Common Pattern #1: Replace a Register with Another; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The 'apply' pattern must always redefine all operands defined by the match root.; Sometimes, we do not need to create instructions, simply replace a def with; another matched register. The ``GIReplaceReg`` builtin can do just that. .. code-block:: text. def Foo : GICombineRule<; (defs root:$dst),; (match (G_FNEG $tmp, $src), (G_FNEG $dst, $tmp)),; (apply (GIReplaceReg $dst, $src))>;.

ROOT automatically applies compression algorithms on n-tuples to reduce; the memory consumption. A value that is in most cases the same will; consume only small space on your disk (but it has to be decompressed on; reading). Nevertheless, you should think about the design of your; n-tuples and your analyses as soon as the processing time exceeds some; minutes. - Try to keep your n-tuples simple and use appropriate variable types.; If your measurement has only a limited precision, it is needless to; store it with double precision. - Experimental conditions that do not change with every single; measurement should be stored in a separate tree. Although the; compression can handle redundant values, the processing time; increase with every variable that has to be filled. - The function `SetCacheSize(long)` specifies the size of the cache; for reading a `TTree` object from a file. The default value is 30MB.; A manual increase may help in certain situations. Please note that; the caching mechanism can cover only one `TTree` object per `TFile`; object. - You can select the branches to be covered by the caching algorithm; with `AddBranchToCache` and deactivate unneeded branches with; `SetBranchStatus`. This mechanism can result in a significant; speed-up for simple operations on trees with many branches. - You can measure the performance easily with `TTreePerfStats`. The; ROOT documentation on this class also includes an introductory; example. For example, `TTreePerfStats` can show you that it is; beneficial to store meta data and payload data separately, i.e.; write the meta data tree in a bulk to a file at the end of your job; instead of writing both trees interleaved.

When ROOT's thread safe mode is enabled and the collection is set to use internal locks by calling:; ```; collection->UseRWLock();; ```; all operations on the collection will take the read or write lock when needed, currently they shared the global lock (ROOT::gCoreMutex). ### Interpreter. - cling's LLVM is upgraded to version 5.0; - All of cling's patches to llvm have been upstreamed.; - The interpreter-related lock is now locking only the compilation step, not the execution step. This reduces the scope for lock contention. Most significantly, it enables the use of concurrency on the prompt!. ## I/O Libraries. - Introduce TKey::ReadObject<typeName>.

These are described in; `GCC Developer Options <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-12.2.0/gcc/Developer-Options.html>`_. There are two ways to configure multilib in Clang: hard-coded or via a; configuration file. Hard-coded Multilib; ===================. The available libraries can be hard-coded in Clang. Typically this is done; using the ``MultilibBuilder`` interface in; ``clang/include/clang/Driver/MultilibBuilder.h``.; There are many examples of this in ``lib/Driver/ToolChains/Gnu.cpp``.; The remainder of this document will not focus on this type of multilib. EXPERIMENTAL Multilib via configuration file; ============================================. Some Clang toolchains support loading multilib configuration from a; ``multilib.yaml`` configuration file. A ``multilib.yaml`` configuration file specifies which multilib variants are; available, their relative location, what compilation options were used to build; them, and the criteria by which they are selected. Multilib processing; ===================. Clang goes through the following steps to use multilib from a configuration; file:. #. Normalize command line options. Clang can accept the same; information via different options - for example,; ``--target=arm-none-eabi -march=armv7-m`` and; ``--target=armv7m-none-eabi`` are equivalent.; Clang normalizes the command line before passing them to the multilib system.; To see what flags are emitted for a given set of command line options, use; the ``-print-multi-flags-experimental`` command line option; along with the rest of the options you want to use.; #.

A numeric variable can also be defined to the result of a numeric expression,; in which case the numeric expression constraint is checked and if verified the; variable is assigned to the value. The unified syntax for both checking a; numeric expression and capturing its value into a numeric variable is thus; ``[[#%<fmtspec>,<NUMVAR>: <constraint> <expr>]]`` with each element as; described previously. One can use this syntax to make a testcase more; self-describing by using variables instead of values:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG_OFFSET:]], 0x[[#%X,FIELD_OFFSET:12]]; ; CHECK-NEXT: load r[[#]], [r[[#REG_BASE:]], r[[#REG_OFFSET]]]. which would match:. .. code-block:: gas. mov r4, 0xC; load r6, [r5, r4].

The implementation of data stored in RooDataSet and RooDataHist; was historically handled by ROOT TTrees (though class RooTreeDataStore). The default storage type; has now been changed to class RooVectorDataStore which stores the information in STL arrays. Existing; datasets based on trees can be read in transparently, and are converted to vector form in the ; persistent-to-transient conversion (the datafile is not modified in this operation); ; The vector store has two important advantages: 1) faster data access (raw data access times are 70 times ; faster than for TTrees), 2) ability to rewrite columns on the fly. The first advantage is important; for the existing constant-term precalculation optimization in roofit likelihoods as these are now; also stored in vectors rather than trees. The faster access speed of vectors make that the constant; term optimization inside likelihoods results in a larger speed increase.

ROOT automatically applies compression algorithms on n-tuples to reduce; the memory consumption. A value that is in most cases the same will; consume only small space on your disk (but it has to be decompressed on; reading). Nevertheless, you should think about the design of your; n-tuples and your analyses as soon as the processing time exceeds some; minutes. - Try to keep your n-tuples simple and use appropriate variable types.; If your measurement has only a limited precision, it is needless to; store it with double precision. - Experimental conditions that do not change with every single; measurement should be stored in a separate tree.

Code generation is deferred until either the; MCJIT::finalizeObject method is called explicitly or a function such as; MCJIT::getPointerToFunction is called which requires the code to have been; generated. Code Generation; ===============. When code generation is triggered, as described above, MCJIT will first; attempt to retrieve an object image from its ObjectCache member, if one; has been set. If a cached object image cannot be retrieved, MCJIT will; call its emitObject method. MCJIT::emitObject uses a local PassManager; instance and creates a new ObjectBufferStream instance, both of which it; passes to TargetMachine::addPassesToEmitMC before calling PassManager::run; on the Module with which it was created. .. image:: MCJIT-load.png. The PassManager::run call causes the MC code generation mechanisms to emit; a complete relocatable binary object image (either in either ELF or MachO; format, depending on the target) into the ObjectBufferStream object, which; is flushed to complete the process. If an ObjectCache is being used, the; image will be passed to the ObjectCache here. At this point, the ObjectBufferStream contains the raw object image.; Before the code can be executed, the code and data sections from this; image must be loaded into suitable memory, relocations must be applied and; memory permission and code cache invalidation (if required) must be completed. Object Loading; ==============. Once an object image has been obtained, either through code generation or; having been retrieved from an ObjectCache, it is passed to RuntimeDyld to; be loaded.

Mitigating this requires hardening loads from these locations, or mitigating; the indirect call or indirect jump. Any of these are sufficient to block the; call or jump from using a speculatively stored value that has been read back. For both of these, using retpolines would be equally sufficient. One possible; hybrid approach is to use retpolines for indirect call and jump, while relying; on SLH to mitigate returns. Another approach that is sufficient for both of these is to harden all of the; speculative stores. However, as most stores aren't interesting and don't; inherently leak data, this is expected to be prohibitively expensive given the; attack it is defending against. ## Implementation Details.

Performance,"d. The speed gain; of this optimization depends much on the structure of the pdf: in models with many free parameters most of the; likelihood evaluations are executed when MINUIT calculates numerical likelihood derivatives which vary ; one parameter at a time and the speedup is potentially larger. In models with few free parameters the; effect will be smaller. The new per-component caching strategy is enabled by default for all pdfs that are a component of; a RooAddPdf or a RooRealSumPdf, unless that component is a RooProdPdf or a RooProduct, in that; case the components of the product are cached instead of the product itself. You can disable this; new optimization by adding Optimize(1) to the RooAbsPdf::fitTo() command line (0 = no caching,; 1 = cache constant terms only, 2 = cache also variable terms according to above mentioned strategy (DEFAULT)). It is also possible to tune this 'cache-and-track' optimization to perform a more fine-grained caching; of components than Optimize(2) implements: to do so, call arg->setAttribute(""CacheAndTrack"") on each; pdf component that you'd like to be cache-and-tracked individually. New pdf/data attach mechanism in likelihood objects (RooAbsOptTestStatistic). The new mechanism only; reattaches the dataset branch buffers and not the RooRealVars representing the data. This new designs; allows for a much faster RooAbsTestStatistic::setData() implementation, which changes the dataset in; an existing likelihood object. This will speed up RooStats tools based on 'simple' likelihood models; substantially. Automatic detections of 'binned' pdfs and automatic generation of binned data in generate().

The supported operators are:. * ``+`` - Returns the sum of its two operands.; * ``-`` - Returns the difference of its two operands. The syntax of a function call is ``<name>(<arguments>)`` where:. * ``name`` is a predefined string literal. Accepted values are:. * add - Returns the sum of its two operands.; * div - Returns the quotient of its two operands.; * max - Returns the largest of its two operands.; * min - Returns the smallest of its two operands.; * mul - Returns the product of its two operands.; * sub - Returns the difference of its two operands. * ``<arguments>`` is a comma separated list of expressions. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK: load r[[#REG:]], [r0]; ; CHECK: load r[[#REG+1]], [r1]; ; CHECK: Loading from 0x[[#%x,ADDR:]]; ; CHECK-SAME: to 0x[[#ADDR + 7]]. The above example would match the text:. .. code-block:: gas. load r5, [r0]; load r6, [r1]; Loading from 0xa0463440 to 0xa0463447. but would not match the text:. .. code-block:: gas. load r5, [r0]; load r7, [r1]; Loading from 0xa0463440 to 0xa0463443. Due to ``7`` being unequal to ``5 + 1`` and ``a0463443`` being unequal to; ``a0463440 + 7``. A numeric variable can also be defined to the result of a numeric expression,; in which case the numeric expression constraint is checked and if verified the; variable is assigned to the value. The unified syntax for both checking a; numeric expression and capturing its value into a numeric variable is thus; ``[[#%<fmtspec>,<NUMVAR>: <constraint> <expr>]]`` with each element as; described previously. One can use this syntax to make a testcase more; self-describing by using variables instead of values:. .. code-block:: gas. ; CHECK: mov r[[#REG_OFFSET:]], 0x[[#%X,FIELD_OFFSET:12]]; ; CHECK-NEXT: load r[[#]], [r[[#REG_BASE:]], r[[#REG_OFFSET]]]. which would match:. .. code-block:: gas. mov r4, 0xC; load r6, [r5, r4].

This calculation is in part; delegated to `TEfficiency`. A single option can be given as a parameter, that is; used to determine which procedure is chosen. The remaining option string is then; passed through to the calculation, if applicable. Several examples illustrate how to use this class. See:; `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/hist/ratioplot?.C`. * New option ""I"" allowing to draw TGraph with invisible axis (used by `TRatioPlot`);. ## New histogram drawing options. ### COL2; COL2 is a new rendering technique providing potential performance improvements; compared to the standard COL option. The performance comparison of the COL2 to; the COL option depends on the histogram and the size of the rendering region in; the current pad. In general, a small (approx. less than 100 bins per axis),; sparsely populated TH2 will render faster with the COL option. However, for larger histograms (approx. more than 100 bins per axis) that are; not sparse, the COL2 option will provide up to 20 times performance improvements.; For example, a 1000x1000 bin TH2 that is not sparse will render an order of; magnitude faster with the COL2 option. The COL2 option will also scale its performance based on the size of the pixmap; the histogram image is being rendered into. It also is much better optimized for; sessions where the user is forwarding X11 windows through an `ssh` connection. For the most part, the COL2 and COLZ2 options are a drop in replacement to the COL; and COLZ options. There is one major difference and that concerns the treatment of; bins with zero content. The COL2 and COLZ2 options color these bins the color of zero.

A safety value less than; TGeoShape::Tolerance() will set the flag IsOnBoundary to true.; On the other hand, a safety value bigger than the proposed step will; stop the computation of the distance to next boundary, returning the; current geometry location with the meaning that the proposed step is; safe. The next stage is to check if computation of the distance to a give; physical object specified by a path was required. If this is the case,; the modeller changes the state to point to the required object, converts; the current point and direction coordinates to the local frame of this; object and computes the distance to its shape. The node returned is the; one pointed by the input path in case the shape is crossed; otherwise; the returned value is NULL. In case the distance to next crossed; boundary is required, the current point has to be physically INSIDE the; shape pointed by the current volume. This is only insured in case a call; to TGeoManager::FindNode() was performed for the current point.; Therefore, the first step is to convert the global current point and; direction in the local reference frame of the current volume and to; compute the distance to exit its shape from inside. The returned value; is again compared to the maximum allowed step (the proposed one) and in; case the distance is safe no other action is performed and the proposed; step is approved. In case the boundary is closer, the computed distance; is taken as maximum allowed step. For optimization purposed, for; particles starting very close to the current volume boundary (less than; 0.01 microns) and exiting the algorithm stops here. After computing the distance to exit the current node, the distance to; the daughter of the current volume which is crossed next is computed by; TGeoManager::FindNextDaughterBoundary(). This computes the; distance to all daughter candidates that can be possibly crossed by; using volume voxelization.

Performance,"d; completes, pass -V to scan-build. Recommended Usage Guidelines; This section describes a few recommendations with running the analyzer.; ALWAYS analyze a project in its ""debug"" configuration; Most projects can be built in a ""debug"" mode that enables assertions.; Assertions are picked up by the static analyzer to prune infeasible paths, which; in some cases can greatly reduce the number of false positives (bogus error; reports) emitted by the tool.; Another option is to use --force-analyze-debug-code flag of; scan-build tool which would enable assertions automatically.; Use verbose output when debugging scan-build; scan-build takes a -v option to emit verbose output about; what it's doing; two -v options emit more information. Redirecting the; output of scan-build to a text file (make sure to redirect standard; error) is useful for filing bug reports against scan-build or the; analyzer, as we can see the exact options (and files) passed to the analyzer.; For more comprehensible logs, don't perform a parallel build.; Run './configure' through scan-build; If an analyzed project uses an autoconf generated configure script,; you will probably need to run configure script through; scan-build in order to analyze the project.; Example. $ scan-build ./configure; $ scan-build --keep-cc make. The reason configure also needs to be run through; scan-build is because scan-build scans your source files by; interposing on the compiler. This interposition is currently done by; scan-build temporarily setting the environment variable CC to; ccc-analyzer. The program ccc-analyzer acts like a fake; compiler, forwarding its command line arguments over to the compiler to perform; regular compilation and clang to perform static analysis.; Running configure typically generates makefiles that have hardwired; paths to the compiler, and by running configure through; scan-build that path is set to ccc-analyzer.

Performance,"d; for the clobber of ``MemoryAccess`` ``2``. By default, ``MemorySSA`` provides a walker that can optimize ``MemoryDef``\ s; and ``MemoryUse``\ s by consulting whatever alias analysis stack you happen to; be using. Walkers were built to be flexible, though, so it's entirely reasonable; (and expected) to create more specialized walkers (e.g. one that specifically; queries ``GlobalsAA``, one that always stops at ``MemoryPhi`` nodes, etc). Default walker APIs; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. There are two main APIs used to retrieve the clobbering access using the walker:. - ``MemoryAccess *getClobberingMemoryAccess(MemoryAccess *MA);`` return the; clobbering memory access for ``MA``, caching all intermediate results; computed along the way as part of each access queried. - ``MemoryAccess *getClobberingMemoryAccess(MemoryAccess *MA, const MemoryLocation &Loc);``; returns the access clobbering memory location ``Loc``, starting at ``MA``.; Because this API does not request the clobbering access of a specific memory; access, there are no results that can be cached. Locating clobbers yourself; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If you choose to make your own walker, you can find the clobber for a; ``MemoryAccess`` by walking every ``MemoryDef`` that dominates said; ``MemoryAccess``. The structure of ``MemoryDef``\ s makes this relatively simple;; they ultimately form a linked list of every clobber that dominates the; ``MemoryAccess`` that you're trying to optimize. In other words, the; ``definingAccess`` of a ``MemoryDef`` is always the nearest dominating; ``MemoryDef`` or ``MemoryPhi`` of said ``MemoryDef``. Use and Def optimization; ------------------------. ``MemoryUse``\ s keep a single operand, which is their defining or optimized; access.; Traditionally ``MemorySSA`` optimized ``MemoryUse``\ s at build-time, up to a; given threshold.; Specifically, the operand of every ``MemoryUse`` was optimized to point to the; actual clobber of said ``MemoryUse``.

Notice that ``Square::classof`` does not need to be changed. .. _classof-contract:. The Contract of ``classof``; ---------------------------. To be more precise, let ``classof`` be inside a class ``C``. Then the; contract for ``classof`` is ""return ``true`` if the dynamic type of the; argument is-a ``C``"". As long as your implementation fulfills this; contract, you can tweak and optimize it as much as you want. For example, LLVM-style RTTI can work fine in the presence of; multiple-inheritance by defining an appropriate ``classof``.; An example of this in practice is; `Decl <https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1Decl.html>`_ vs.; `DeclContext <https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1DeclContext.html>`_; inside Clang.; The ``Decl`` hierarchy is done very similarly to the example setup; demonstrated in this tutorial.; The key part is how to then incorporate ``DeclContext``: all that is needed; is in ``bool DeclContext::classof(const Decl *)``, which asks the question; ""Given a ``Decl``, how can I determine if it is-a ``DeclContext``?"".; It answers this with a simple switch over the set of ``Decl`` ""kinds"", and; returning true for ones that are known to be ``DeclContext``'s. ..

This pass performs loop invariant code motion, attempting to remove as much; code from the body of a loop as possible. It does this by either hoisting code; into the preheader block, or by sinking code to the exit blocks if it is safe.; This pass also promotes must-aliased memory locations in the loop to live in; registers, thus hoisting and sinking ""invariant"" loads and stores. Hoisting operations out of loops is a canonicalization transform. It enables; and simplifies subsequent optimizations in the middle-end. Rematerialization; of hoisted instructions to reduce register pressure is the responsibility of; the back-end, which has more accurate information about register pressure and; also handles other optimizations than LICM that increase live-ranges. This pass uses alias analysis for two purposes:. #. Moving loop invariant loads and calls out of loops. If we can determine; that a load or call inside of a loop never aliases anything stored to, we; can hoist it or sink it like any other instruction. #. Scalar Promotion of Memory. If there is a store instruction inside of the; loop, we try to move the store to happen AFTER the loop instead of inside of; the loop. This can only happen if a few conditions are true:. #.

They are similar to :ref:`Masked Vector Load and Store <int_mload_mstore>`, except they are designed for arbitrary memory accesses, rather than sequential memory accesses.

Performance,"ddress space back to a small positive address. Small, negative addresses will; fault in user-mode for most operating systems, but targets which need the high; address space to be user accessible may need to adjust the exact sequence used; above. Additionally, the low addresses will need to be marked unreadable by the; OS to fully harden the load. ###### RIP-relative addressing is even easier to break. There is a common addressing mode idiom that is substantially harder to check:; addressing relative to the instruction pointer. We cannot change the value of; the instruction pointer register and so we have the harder problem of forcing; `%base + scale * %index + offset` to be an invalid address, by *only* changing; `%index`. The only advantage we have is that the attacker also cannot modify; `%base`. If we use the fast instruction sequence above, but only apply it to; the index, we will always access `%rip + (scale * -1) + offset`. If the; attacker can find a load which with this address happens to point to secret; data, then they can reach it. However, the loader and base libraries can also; simply refuse to map the heap, data segments, or stack within 2gb of any of the; text in the program, much like it can reserve the low 2gb of address space. ###### The flag registers again make everything hard. Unfortunately, the technique of using `orq`-instructions has a serious flaw on; x86. The very thing that makes it easy to accumulate state, the flag registers; containing predicates, causes serious problems here because they may be alive; and used by the loading instruction or subsequent instructions. On x86, the; `orq` instruction **sets** the flags and will override anything already there.; This makes inserting them into the instruction stream very hazardous.; Unfortunately, unlike when hardening the loaded value, we have no fallback here; and so we must have a fully general approach available.

In this case, the only loop closing PHI node is X4.; This means that we can just copy the loop and change the X4; accordingly, like so:. .. code-block:: C. c = ...;; if (c) {; for (...) {; if (true); X1 = ...; else; X2 = ...; X3 = phi(X1, X2);; }; } else {; for (...) {; if (false); X1' = ...; else; X2' = ...; X3' = phi(X1', X2');; }; }; X4 = phi(X3, X3'). Now, all uses of X4 will get the updated value (in general,; if a loop is in LCSSA form, in any loop transformation,; we only need to update the loop closing PHI nodes for the changes; to take effect). If we did not have Loop Closed SSA form, it means that X3 could; possibly be used outside the loop. So, we would have to introduce the; X4 (which is the new X3) and replace all uses of X3 with that.; However, we should note that because LLVM keeps a def-use chain; [#def-use-chain]_ for each Value, we wouldn't need; to perform data-flow analysis to find and replace all the uses; (there is even a utility function, replaceAllUsesWith(),; that performs this transformation by iterating the def-use chain). Another important advantage is that the behavior of all uses; of an induction variable is the same. Without this, you need to; distinguish the case when the variable is used outside of; the loop it is defined in, for example:. .. code-block:: C. for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {; for (j = 0; j < 100; j++) {; k = i + j;; use(k); // use 1; }; use(k); // use 2; }.

CMake Caches; ============. Recently LLVM and Clang have been adding some more complicated build system; features. Utilizing these new features often involves a complicated chain of; CMake variables passed on the command line. Clang provides a collection of CMake; cache scripts to make these features more approachable. CMake cache files are utilized using CMake's -C flag:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -C <path to cache file> <path to sources>.

CMake cached variables do not reset; variables that are already set unless the FORCE option is specified.

As expected, we now get our nicely optimized code, saving a floating; point add instruction from every execution of this function. LLVM provides a wide variety of optimizations that can be used in; certain circumstances. Some `documentation about the various; passes <../../Passes.html>`_ is available, but it isn't very complete.; Another good source of ideas can come from looking at the passes that; ``Clang`` runs to get started. The ""``opt``"" tool allows you to; experiment with passes from the command line, so you can see if they do; anything. Now that we have reasonable code coming out of our front-end, let's talk; about executing it!. Adding a JIT Compiler; =====================. Code that is available in LLVM IR can have a wide variety of tools; applied to it. For example, you can run optimizations on it (as we did; above), you can dump it out in textual or binary forms, you can compile; the code to an assembly file (.s) for some target, or you can JIT; compile it. The nice thing about the LLVM IR representation is that it; is the ""common currency"" between many different parts of the compiler. In this section, we'll add JIT compiler support to our interpreter. The; basic idea that we want for Kaleidoscope is to have the user enter; function bodies as they do now, but immediately evaluate the top-level; expressions they type in. For example, if they type in ""1 + 2;"", we; should evaluate and print out 3. If they define a function, they should; be able to call it from the command line. In order to do this, we first prepare the environment to create code for; the current native target and declare and initialize the JIT. This is; done by calling some ``InitializeNativeTarget\*`` functions and; adding a global variable ``TheJIT``, and initializing it in; ``main``:. .. code-block:: c++. static std::unique_ptr<KaleidoscopeJIT> ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl04.rst:9711,optimiz,optimizations,9711,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl04.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl04.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']
Performance,"del with a more robust, more efficient semantic model. From the user's perspective, the code looks only slightly different, because one uses an ``import`` declaration rather than a ``#include`` preprocessor directive:. .. code-block:: c. import std.io; // pseudo-code; see below for syntax discussion. However, this module import behaves quite differently from the corresponding ``#include <stdio.h>``: when the compiler sees the module import above, it loads a binary representation of the ``std.io`` module and makes its API available to the application directly. Preprocessor definitions that precede the import declaration have no impact on the API provided by ``std.io``, because the module itself was compiled as a separate, standalone module. Additionally, any linker flags required to use the ``std.io`` module will automatically be provided when the module is imported [#]_; This semantic import model addresses many of the problems of the preprocessor inclusion model:. * **Compile-time scalability**: The ``std.io`` module is only compiled once, and importing the module into a translation unit is a constant-time operation (independent of module system). Thus, the API of each software library is only parsed once, reducing the *M x N* compilation problem to an *M + N* problem. * **Fragility**: Each module is parsed as a standalone entity, so it has a consistent preprocessor environment. This completely eliminates the need for ``__underscored`` names and similarly defensive tricks. Moreover, the current preprocessor definitions when an import declaration is encountered are ignored, so one software library can not affect how another software library is compiled, eliminating include-order dependencies. * **Tool confusion**: Modules describe the API of software libraries, and tools can reason about and present a module as a representation of that API. Because modules can only be built standalone, tools can rely on the module definition to ensure that they get the complete API f",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:4972,scalab,scalability,4972,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,1,['scalab'],['scalability']
Performance,"depends on its storage duration. Initialization proceeds in two stages:. #. First, a null pointer is stored into the lvalue using primitive semantics.; This step is skipped if the object is ``__unsafe_unretained``.; #. Second, if the object has an initializer, that expression is evaluated and; then assigned into the object using the usual assignment semantics. :arc-term:`Destruction` occurs when an object's lifetime ends. In all cases it; is semantically equivalent to assigning a null pointer to the object, with the; proviso that of course the object cannot be legally read after the object's; lifetime ends. :arc-term:`Moving` occurs in specific situations where an lvalue is ""moved; from"", meaning that its current pointee will be used but the object may be left; in a different (but still valid) state. This arises with ``__block`` variables; and rvalue references in C++. For ``__strong`` lvalues, moving is equivalent; to loading the lvalue with primitive semantics, writing a null pointer to it; with primitive semantics, and then releasing the result of the load at the end; of the current full-expression. For all other lvalues, moving is equivalent to; reading the object. .. _arc.ownership.restrictions:. Restrictions; ------------. .. _arc.ownership.restrictions.weak:.

Performance,"der basic block so; that the loop has a preheader and it introduced the %loop.exit; basic block so that the loop has dedicated exits; (otherwise, %exit would be jumped from both %latch and %entry,; but %entry is not contained in the loop).; Note that a loop has to be in Loop Simplify Form beforehand; too for LoopRotate to be applied successfully. The main advantage of this form is that it allows hoisting; invariant instructions, especially loads, into the preheader.; That could be done in non-rotated loops as well but with; some disadvantages. Let's illustrate them with an example:. .. code-block:: C. for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {; auto v = *p;; use(v);; }. We assume that loading from p is invariant and use(v) is some; statement that uses v.; If we wanted to execute the load only once we could move it; ""out"" of the loop body, resulting in this:. .. code-block:: C. auto v = *p;; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {; use(v);; }. However, now, in the case that n <= 0, in the initial form,; the loop body would never execute, and so, the load would; never execute. This is a problem mainly for semantic reasons.; Consider the case in which n <= 0 and loading from p is invalid.; In the initial program there would be no error. However, with this; transformation we would introduce one, effectively breaking; the initial semantics. To avoid both of these problems, we can insert a guard:. .. code-block:: C. if (n > 0) { // loop guard; auto v = *p;; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {; use(v);; }; }. This is certainly better but it could be improved slightly. Notice; that the check for whether n is bigger than 0 is executed twice (and; n does not change in between). Once when we check the guard condition; and once in the first execution of the loop. To avoid that, we could; do an unconditional first execution and insert the loop condition; in the end.

The compiler needs to use the function attributes to ensure the; compiler doesn't do transformations under the assumption that certain operations; are available at runtime. We made a conscious choice not to model this with feature flags, because we; still want to support inline-asm in either mode (with the user placing; smstart/smstop manually), and this became rather complicated to implement at the; individual instruction level (see `D120261 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D120261>`_; and `D121208 <https://reviews.llvm.org/D121208>`_) because of limitations in; TableGen. As a first step, this means we'll disable vectorization (LoopVectorize/SLP); entirely when the a function has either of the ``aarch64_pstate_sm_enabled``,; ``aarch64_pstate_sm_body`` or ``aarch64_pstate_sm_compatible`` attributes,; in order to avoid the use of vector instructions. Later on we'll aim to relax these restrictions to enable scalable; auto-vectorization with a subset of streaming-compatible instructions, but that; requires changes to the CostModel, Legalization and SelectionDAG lowering. We will also emit diagnostics in Clang to prevent the use of; non-streaming(-compatible) operations, e.g. through ACLE intrinsics, when a; function is decorated with the streaming mode attributes. Other things to consider; ------------------------. * Inlining must be disabled when the call-site needs to toggle PSTATE.SM or; when the callee's function body is executed in a different streaming mode than; its caller.

A; method that performs this task finding the next location is; `TGeoManager::Step()`, described in "" Making a Step "", but users may; implement more precise methods to insure post-step boundary crossing. ## Geometry Graphical User Interface. The geombuilder package allows you to create and edit geometries. The; package provides a library of all GUI classes related to geometry. Each; editable geometry class **`TGeoXXX`** have a correspondent editor; **`TGeoXXXEditor`** that provides a graphics user interface allowing to; edit some (or all) parameters of a geometry object.

There are two different use cases having different ways of invoking the; geometry editors.

Performance,"dfBuilder tool which had a similar functionality but; has a much cleaner interface, partly thanks to its use of the RooWorkspace class for both input; of prototype p.d.fs and output of built p.d.f.s. The simplest use case to to take a workspace p.d.f as prototype and 'split' a parameter of that p.d.f ; into two specialized parameters depending on a category in the dataset. ; For example, given a Gaussian p.d.f G(x,m,s) we want to construct a G_a(x,m_a,s) and a G_b(x,m_b,s); with different mean parameters to be fit to a dataset with observables; (x,c) where c is a category with states 'a' and 'b'.; Using RooSimWSTool one can create a simultaneous p.d.f from G_a and G_b; from G with the following command. RooSimWSTool wst(wspace) ;; wst.build(""G_sim"",""G"",SplitParam(""m"",""c"")) ;.

Splits can also be performed; in the product multiple categories, e.g. . SplitParam(""m"",""c,d"")) ;. splits parameter m in the product of states of c and d.

We could read that value from memory; as part of the conditional move instruction, however, this creates more; micro-ops and requires the load-store unit to be involved. Currently, we place; the value into a virtual register and allow the register allocator to decide; when the register pressure is sufficient to make it worth spilling to memory; and reloading. #### Hardening Loads. Once we have the predicate accumulated into a special value for correct vs.; misspeculated, we need to apply this to loads in a way that ensures they do not; leak secret data. There are two primary techniques for this: we can either; harden the loaded value to prevent observation, or we can harden the address; itself to prevent the load from occurring. These have significantly different; performance tradeoffs. ##### Hardening loaded values. The most appealing way to harden loads is to mask out all of the bits loaded.; The key requirement is that for each bit loaded, along the misspeculated path; that bit is always fixed at either 0 or 1 regardless of the value of the bit; loaded. The most obvious implementation uses either an `and` instruction with; an all-zero mask along misspeculated paths and an all-one mask along correct; paths, or an `or` instruction with an all-one mask along misspeculated paths; and an all-zero mask along correct paths. Other options become less appealing; such as multiplying by zero, or multiple shift instructions. For reasons we; elaborate on below, we end up suggesting you use `or` with an all-ones mask,; making the x86 instruction sequence look like the following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; movl (%rsi), %edi # Load potentially secret data from %rsi.; orl %eax, %edi; ```.

It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exceed that of an `lfence` when *correctly* speculatively; executed. But in that case, the `lfence` cost is a complete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model. Several optimizations were considered which didn't pan out due to failure to; uphold the security model. One in particular is worth discussing as many others; will reduce to it.

When hardening the loaded value is inapplicable, most often because the; instruction directly leaks information (like `cmp` or `jmpq`), we switch to; hardening the _address_ of the load instead of the loaded value. This avoids; increasing register pressure by unfolding the load or paying some other high; cost. To understand how this works in practice, we need to examine the exact; semantics of the x86 addressing modes which, in its fully general form, looks; like `(%base,%index,scale)offset`. Here `%base` and `%index` are 64-bit; registers that can potentially be any value, and may be attacker controlled,; and `scale` and `offset` are fixed immediate values. `scale` must be `1`, `2`,; `4`, or `8`, and `offset` can be any 32-bit sign extended value. The exact; computation performed to find the address is then: `%base + (scale * %index) +; offset` under 64-bit 2's complement modular arithmetic. One issue with this approach is that, after hardening, the `%base + (scale *; %index)` subexpression will compute a value near zero (`-1 + (scale * -1)`) and; then a large, positive `offset` will index into memory within the first two; gigabytes of address space. While these offsets are not attacker controlled,; the attacker could chose to attack a load which happens to have the desired; offset and then successfully read memory in that region. This significantly; raises the burden on the attacker and limits the scope of attack but does not; eliminate it. To fully close the attack we must work with the operating system; to preclude mapping memory in the low two gigabytes of address space. ###### 64-bit load checking instructions. We can use the following instruction sequences to check loads. We set up `%r8`; in these examples to hold the special value of `-1` which will be `cmov`ed over; `%rax` in misspeculated pa",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:28314,perform,performed,28314,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['perform'],['performed']

When RooFit performs binned fits, it takes the probability density at the bin centre as a proxy for the probability in the bin. This can lead to a bias.; To alleviate this, the new class [RooBinSamplingPdf](https://root.cern/doc/v624/classRooBinSamplingPdf.html) has been added to RooFit.; Also see [arxiv:2012.02746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02746). ### More accurate residual and pull distributions. When making residual or pull distributions with `RooPlot::residHist` or `RooPlot::pullHist`, the histogram is now compared with the curve's average values within a given bin by default, ensuring that residual and pull distributions are valid for strongly curved distributions.; The old default behaviour was to interpolate the curve at the bin centres, which can still be enabled by setting the `useAverage` parameter of `RooPlot::residHist` or `RooPlot::pullHist` to `false`. ### Improved recovery from invalid parameters.

Sometimes it is better to codegen subtractions from a constant (e.g. 7-x) with; a neg instead of a sub instruction. Consider:. int test(char X) { return 7-X; }. we currently produce:; _test:; movl $7, %eax; movsbl 4(%esp), %ecx; subl %ecx, %eax; ret. We would use one fewer register if codegen'd as:. movsbl 4(%esp), %eax; 	neg %eax; add $7, %eax; ret. Note that this isn't beneficial if the load can be folded into the sub. In; this case, we want a sub:. int test(int X) { return 7-X; }; _test:; movl $7, %eax; subl 4(%esp), %eax; ret. //===---------------------------------------------------------------------===//. Leaf functions that require one 4-byte spill slot have a prolog like this:. _foo:; pushl %esi; subl $4, %esp; ...; and an epilog like this:; addl $4, %esp; popl %esi; ret.

We added a cache specifically for the fast option of the TTreeCloner to significantly reduce the run-time when fast-cloning remote files to address [ROOT-5078]. It can be controlled from the `TTreeCloner`, `TTree::CopyEntries` or `hadd` interfaces. The new cache is enabled by default, to update the size of the cache or disable it from `TTreeCloner` use: `TTreeCloner::SetCacheSize`. To do the same from `TTree::CopyEntries` add to the option string ""cachesize=SIZE"". To update the size of the cache or disable it from `hadd`, use the command line option `-cachesize SIZE`. `SIZE` shouyld be given in number bytes and can be expressed in 'human readable form' (number followed by size unit like MB, MiB, GB or GiB, etc. or SIZE can be set zero to disable the cache. ### Other Changes. * Update `TChain::LoadTree` so that the user call back routine is actually called for each input file even those containing `TTree` objects with no entries.; * Repair setting the branch address of a leaflist style branch taking directly the address of the struct. (Note that leaflist is nonetheless still deprecated and declaring the struct to the interpreter and passing the object directly to create the branch is much better).; * Provide an implicitly parallel implementation of `TTree::GetEntry`. The approach is based on creating a task per top-level branch in order to do the reading, unzipping and deserialisation in parallel. In addition, a getter and a setter methods are provided to check the status and enable/disable implicit multi-threading for that tree (see Parallelisation section for more information about implicit multi-threading).; * Properly support `std::cin` (and other stream that can not be rewound) in `TTree::ReadStream`.

The runtime must be able to interpret the; stack map record given only the ID, offset, and the order of the; locations, records, and functions, which LLVM preserves. Note that this is quite different from the goal of debug information,; which is a best-effort attempt to track the location of named; variables at every instruction. An important motivation for this design is to allow a runtime to; commandeer a stack frame when execution reaches an instruction address; associated with a stack map. The runtime must be able to rebuild a; stack frame and resume program execution using the information; provided by the stack map. For example, execution may resume in an; interpreter or a recompiled version of the same function. This usage restricts LLVM optimization. Clearly, LLVM must not move; stores across a stack map. However, loads must also be handled; conservatively. If the load may trigger an exception, hoisting it; above a stack map could be invalid. For example, the runtime may; determine that a load is safe to execute without a type check given; the current state of the type system. If the type system changes while; some activation of the load's function exists on the stack, the load; becomes unsafe. The runtime can prevent subsequent execution of that; load by immediately patching any stack map location that lies between; the current call site and the load (typically, the runtime would; simply patch all stack map locations to invalidate the function). If; the compiler had hoisted the load above the stack map, then the; program could crash before the runtime could take back control. To enforce these semantics, stackmap and patchpoint intrinsics are; considered to potentially read and write all memory. This may limit; optimization more than some clients desire.

Performance,"dress itself. ###### Loads folded into data-invariant operations can be hardened after the operation. The first key to making this feasible is to recognize that many operations on; x86 are ""data-invariant"". That is, they have no (known) observable behavior; differences due to the particular input data. These instructions are often used; when implementing cryptographic primitives dealing with private key data; because they are not believed to provide any side-channels. Similarly, we can; defer hardening until after them as they will not in-and-of-themselves; introduce a speculative execution side-channel. This results in code sequences; that look like:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate without leaking.; orl %eax, %edi; ```. While an addition happens to the loaded (potentially secret) value, that; doesn't leak any data and we then immediately harden it. ###### Hardening of loaded values deferred down the data-invariant expression graph. We can generalize the previous idea and sink the hardening down the expression; graph across as many data-invariant operations as desirable. This can use very; conservative rules for whether something is data-invariant. The primary goal; should be to handle multiple loads with a single hardening instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate without leaking.; addl 4(%rsi), %edi # Continue without leaking.; addl 8(%rsi), %edi; orl %eax, %edi # Mask out bits from all three loads.; ```. ###### Preserving the flags while hardening loaded values on Haswell, Zen, and newer processors. Sadly, there are no useful instructions on x86 that apply a mask to all 64 bits; without touching the flag registers. However, we can harden loaded values that; are narrower than a word (fewer than 32-bits on 32-bit systems and fewer than; 64-bits on 64-bit systems) by zero-e",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:26032,load,loaded,26032,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['loaded']
Performance,"dress space to be user accessible may need to adjust the exact sequence used; above. Additionally, the low addresses will need to be marked unreadable by the; OS to fully harden the load. ###### RIP-relative addressing is even easier to break. There is a common addressing mode idiom that is substantially harder to check:; addressing relative to the instruction pointer. We cannot change the value of; the instruction pointer register and so we have the harder problem of forcing; `%base + scale * %index + offset` to be an invalid address, by *only* changing; `%index`. The only advantage we have is that the attacker also cannot modify; `%base`. If we use the fast instruction sequence above, but only apply it to; the index, we will always access `%rip + (scale * -1) + offset`. If the; attacker can find a load which with this address happens to point to secret; data, then they can reach it. However, the loader and base libraries can also; simply refuse to map the heap, data segments, or stack within 2gb of any of the; text in the program, much like it can reserve the low 2gb of address space. ###### The flag registers again make everything hard. Unfortunately, the technique of using `orq`-instructions has a serious flaw on; x86. The very thing that makes it easy to accumulate state, the flag registers; containing predicates, causes serious problems here because they may be alive; and used by the loading instruction or subsequent instructions. On x86, the; `orq` instruction **sets** the flags and will override anything already there.; This makes inserting them into the instruction stream very hazardous.; Unfortunately, unlike when hardening the loaded value, we have no fallback here; and so we must have a fully general approach available. The first thing we must do when generating these sequences is try to analyze; the surrounding code to prove that the flags are not in fact alive or being; used. Typically, it has been set by some other instruction which just happens; to s",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:30974,load,loader,30974,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['loader']
Performance,"dress. Most; of GEP's special aliasing rules do not apply to pointers computed from ptrtoint,; arithmetic, and inttoptr sequences. Can I compute the distance between two objects, and add that value to one address to compute the other address?; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. As with arithmetic on null, you can use GEP to compute an address that way, but; you can't use that pointer to actually access the object if you do, unless the; object is managed outside of LLVM. Also as above, ptrtoint and inttoptr provide an alternative way to do this which; do not have this restriction. Can I do type-based alias analysis on LLVM IR?; ----------------------------------------------. You can't do type-based alias analysis using LLVM's built-in type system,; because LLVM has no restrictions on mixing types in addressing, loads or stores. LLVM's type-based alias analysis pass uses metadata to describe a different type; system (such as the C type system), and performs type-based aliasing on top of; that. Further details are in the; `language reference <LangRef.html#tbaa-metadata>`_. What happens if a GEP computation overflows?; --------------------------------------------. If the GEP lacks the ``inbounds`` keyword, the value is the result from; evaluating the implied two's complement integer computation. However, since; there's no guarantee of where an object will be allocated in the address space,; such values have limited meaning. If the GEP has the ``inbounds`` keyword, the result value is ``poison``; if the GEP overflows (i.e. wraps around the end of the address space). As such, there are some ramifications of this for inbounds GEPs: scales implied; by array/vector/pointer indices are always known to be ""nsw"" since they are; signed values that are scaled by the element size. These values are also; allowed to be negative (e.g. ""``gep i32, ptr %P, i32 -1``"") but the pointer; itself is logically treat",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst:17195,perform,performs,17195,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GetElementPtr.rst,1,['perform'],['performs']

This is; the default when the input is a header file. * **IR generation**: This converts the source-level intermediate representation; into an optimizer-specific intermediate representation (IR); for Clang, this; is LLVM IR.; The ``-emit-llvm`` flag instructs Clang to stop after this step. If combined; with ``-S``, Clang will produce textual LLVM IR; otherwise, it will produce; LLVM IR bitcode. * **Compiler backend**: This converts the intermediate representation; into target-specific assembly code.; The ``-S`` flag instructs Clang to stop after this step. * **Assembler**: This converts target-specific assembly code into; target-specific machine code object files.; The ``-c`` flag instructs Clang to stop after this step. * **Linker**: This combines multiple object files into a single image; (either a shared object or an executable).

Performance,"ds are allowed; a load which is part of a race returns; ``undef``, but does not have undefined behavior. Atomic instructions; ===================. For cases where simple loads and stores are not sufficient, LLVM provides; various atomic instructions. The exact guarantees provided depend on the; ordering; see `Atomic orderings`_. ``load atomic`` and ``store atomic`` provide the same basic functionality as; non-atomic loads and stores, but provide additional guarantees in situations; where threads and signals are involved. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are essentially like an atomic load followed by an; atomic store (where the store is conditional for ``cmpxchg``), but no other; memory operation can happen on any thread between the load and store. A ``fence`` provides Acquire and/or Release ordering which is not part; of another operation; it is normally used along with Monotonic memory; operations. A Monotonic load followed by an Acquire fence is roughly; equivalent to an Acquire load, and a Monotonic store following a; Release fence is roughly equivalent to a Release; store. SequentiallyConsistent fences behave as both an Acquire and a; Release fence, and additionally provide a total ordering with some; complicated guarantees, see the C++ standard for details. Frontends generating atomic instructions generally need to be aware of the; target to some degree; atomic instructions are guaranteed to be lock-free, and; therefore an instruction which is wider than the target natively supports can be; impossible to generate. .. _Atomic orderings:. Atomic orderings; ================. In order to achieve a balance between performance and necessary guarantees,; there are six levels of atomicity. They are listed in order of strength; each; level includes all the guarantees of the previous level except for; Acquire/Release.

Array-Style Subscripting; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When the subscript operand has an integral type, the expression is; rewritten to use one of two different selectors, depending on whether; the element is being read or written. When an expression reads an; element using an integral index, as in the following example:. .. code-block:: objc. NSUInteger idx = ...;; id value = object[idx];. it is translated into a call to ``objectAtIndexedSubscript:``. .. code-block:: objc. id value = [object objectAtIndexedSubscript:idx];. When an expression writes an element using an integral index:. .. code-block:: objc. object[idx] = newValue;. it is translated to a call to ``setObject:atIndexedSubscript:``. .. code-block:: objc. [object setObject:newValue atIndexedSubscript:idx];. These message sends are then type-checked and performed just like; explicit message sends. The method used for objectAtIndexedSubscript:; must be declared with an argument of integral type and a return value of; some Objective-C object pointer type. The method used for; setObject:atIndexedSubscript: must be declared with its first argument; having some Objective-C pointer type and its second argument having; integral type. The meaning of indexes is left up to the declaring class. The compiler; will coerce the index to the appropriate argument type of the method it; uses for type-checking.

With the introduction of modules, now the compiler have; the chance to perform ODR violations with language semantics across translation units.

However, the; implementation technique below is specifically designed to mitigate this; implicit load by using the stack pointer to communicate misspeculation between; functions. This additionally causes a misspeculation to have an invalid stack; pointer and never be able to read the speculatively stored return address. See; the detailed discussion below. For variant #1.2, the attacker speculatively stores into the vtable or jump; table used to implement an indirect call or indirect jump.

Performance,"e ""invisible"" at tracking time. Let us suppose that we need to group together two volumes `A` and `B`; into a structure and position this into several other volumes `D,E,` and; `F`. What we need to do is to create a virtual container volume `C`; holding `A` and `B`, then position `C` in the other volumes. Note that `C` is a volume having a determined medium. Since it is not a; real volume, we need to manually set its medium the same as that of; `D,E` or `F` in order to make it ""invisible"" (same physics properties).; In other words, the limitation in proceeding this way is that `D,E,` and; `F` must point to the same medium. If this was not the case, we would; have to define different virtual volumes for each placement: `C`, `C`'; and `C`\"", having the same shape but different media matching the; corresponding containers. This might not happen so often, but when it; does, it forces the creation of several extra virtual volumes. Other; limitation comes from the fact that any container is directly used by; navigation algorithms to optimize tracking. These must geometrically; contain their belongings (positioned volumes) so that these do not; extrude its shape boundaries. Not respecting this rule generally leads; to unpredictable results. Therefore `A` and `B` together must fit into; `C` that has to fit also into `D`, `E`, and `F`. This is not always; straightforward to accomplish, especially when instead of `A` and `B` we; have many more volumes. In order to avoid these problems, one can use for the difficult cases; the class TGeoVolumeAssembly, representing an assembly of volumes.; This behaves like a normal container volume supporting other volumes; positioned inside, but it has neither shape nor medium.

Writing continues as described in steps 2-5 above. ### Reading Case; The reverse process is performed on reading (e.g. `RNTupleReader::LoadEntry()`, `RNTupleView` call operator). By default, the page source uses an `RClusterPool` to asynchronously read-ahead data.; When a page of a certain cluster is required, the cluster pool reads pages of _active_ columns.; For instance, if only certain fields are used (e.g., through an imposed model), only the pages of columns connected to those fields are read.; Columns can be dynamically added (e.g. during event iteration, a new field view is created in a reader).; The cluster pool reads ahead a limited number of clusters given by the _cluster bunch size_ option (default = 1).; The read-ahead uses vector reads.; For the file backend, it additionally coalesces close read requests and uses uring reads when available. The page source can be restricted to a certain entry range.; This allows for optimizing the page lists that are being read.; Additionally, it allows for optimizing the cluster pool to not read-ahead beyond the limits. #### Late model extension; Reading an RNTuple with an extended model is transparent -- i.e., no additional interface calls are required.; Internally, columns that were created as part of late model extension will have synthesized zero-initialized column ranges for the clusters that were already written before the model was extended.; In addition, pages made up of 0x00 bytes are synthesized for deferred columns in the clusters that were already (partially) filled before the model was extended.

Can't we just fix the sections by adding all of the names we need to this; table? No, because that is not what the tables are defined to contain and we; won't know the difference between the old bad tables and the new good tables.; At best we could make our own renamed sections that contain all of the data we; need. These tables are also insufficient for what a debugger like LLDB needs. LLDB; uses clang for its expression parsing where LLDB acts as a PCH. LLDB is then; often asked to look for type ""``foo``"" or namespace ""``bar``"", or list items in; namespace ""``baz``"". Namespaces are not included in the pubnames or pubtypes; tables. Since clang asks a lot of questions when it is parsing an expression,; we need to be very fast when looking up names, as it happens a lot. Having new; accelerator tables that are optimized for very quick lookups will benefit this; type of debugging experience greatly. We would like to generate name lookup tables that can be mapped into memory; from disk, and used as is, with little or no up-front parsing. We would also; be able to control the exact content of these different tables so they contain; exactly what we need. The Name Accelerator Tables were designed to fix these; issues. In order to solve these issues we need to:. * Have a format that can be mapped into memory from disk and used as is; * Lookups should be very fast; * Extensible table format so these tables can be made by many producers; * Contain all of the names needed for typical lookups out of the box; * Strict rules for the contents of tables.

Performance,"e and NOT incremental builds; Using ccache materially improves average build times. Incremental builds; can be slightly faster, but introduce the risk of build corruption due to; e.g. state changes, etc... At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental builds and instead use ccache as the latter captures the; majority of the benefit with less risk of false positives. One of the non-obvious benefits of using ccache is that it makes the; builder less sensitive to which projects are being monitored vs built.; If a change triggers a build request, but doesn't change the build output; (e.g. doc changes, python utility changes, etc..), the build will entirely; hit in cache and the build request will complete in just the testing time. With multiple workers, it is tempting to try to configure a shared cache; between the workers. Experience to date indicates this is difficult to; well, and that having local per-worker caches gets most of the benefit; anyways. We don't currently recommend shared caches. CCache does depend on the builder hardware having sufficient IO to access; the cache with reasonable access times - i.e. a fast disk, or enough memory; for a RAM cache, etc.. For builders without, incremental may be your best; option, but is likely to require higher ongoing involvement from the; sponsor. Enable batch builds; As a last resort, you can configure your builder to batch build requests.; This makes the build failure notifications markedly less actionable, and; should only be done once all other reasonable measures have been taken. Leave it on the staging buildmaster; While most of this section has been biased towards builders intended for; the main buildmaster, it is worth highlighting that builders can run; indefinitely on the staging buildmaster.

Performance,"e big two are:. #. Compile time of the distribution against performance of the built compiler. #. Binary size of the distribution against performance of the built compiler. The guidance for maximizing performance of the generated compiler is to use LTO,; PGO, and statically link everything. This will result in an overall larger; distribution, and it will take longer to generate, but it provides the most; opportunity for the compiler to optimize. The guidance for minimizing distribution size is to dynamically link LLVM and; Clang libraries into the tools to reduce code duplication. This will come at a; substantial performance penalty to the generated binary both because it reduces; optimization opportunity, and because dynamic linking requires resolving symbols; at process launch time, which can be very slow for C++ code. .. _shared_libs:. .. warning::; One very important note: Distributions should never be built using the; *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake option.

This requires building a; special instrumented version of the code and has some runtime; overhead during the profiling, but it provides more detailed results than a; sampling profiler. It also provides reproducible results, at least to the; extent that the code behaves consistently across runs. Clang supports two types of instrumentation: frontend-based and IR-based.; Frontend-based instrumentation can be enabled with the option ``-fprofile-instr-generate``,; and IR-based instrumentation can be enabled with the option ``-fprofile-generate``.; For best performance with PGO, IR-based instrumentation should be used. It has; the benefits of lower instrumentation overhead, smaller raw profile size, and; better runtime performance. Frontend-based instrumentation, on the other hand,; has better source correlation, so it should be used with source line-based; coverage testing. The flag ``-fcs-profile-generate`` also instruments programs using the same; instrumentation method as ``-fprofile-generate``. However, it performs a; post-inline late instrumentation and can produce context-sensitive profiles. Here are the steps for using profile guided optimization with; instrumentation:. 1.

The implementation avoids recursive actions and relies on a well-defined (by; the C++ standard) behavior. Currently, this comes with a constant performance; overhead which we go in details bellow. ROOT uses the global module index (GMI) to avoid the performance overhead. ROOT; only preloads the set of C++ modules which are not present in the GMI. The; example becomes equivalent to:. ```cpp; // ROOT prompt; root [] import Foo.*; // Preload Foo if it is not in the GMI.; root [] S *s; // #1: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar *baz1; // #2: does not require a definition.; root [] foo::bar baz2; // #3: requires a definition.; root [] TCanvas* c = new TCanvas(); // #4 requires a definition; ```.

Instruction Selector; ====================. LLVM uses a ``SelectionDAG`` to represent LLVM IR instructions, and nodes of; the ``SelectionDAG`` ideally represent native target instructions. During code; generation, instruction selection passes are performed to convert non-native; DAG instructions into native target-specific instructions. The pass described; in ``XXXISelDAGToDAG.cpp`` is used to match patterns and perform DAG-to-DAG; instruction selection. Optionally, a pass may be defined (in; ``XXXBranchSelector.cpp``) to perform similar DAG-to-DAG operations for branch; instructions.

If the expression; appears on the left-hand side of a compound assignment operator (e.g.; +=), the program is ill-formed, because the result of reading an element; is always an Objective-C object pointer and no binary operators are; legal on such pointers. If the expression appears in any other position,; the element is read as described below. It is an error to take the; address of a subscript expression, or (in C++) to bind a reference to; it. Programs can use object subscripting with Objective-C object pointers of; type ``id``.

Objects created using the literal or boxed expression syntax are not; guaranteed to be uniqued by the runtime, but nor are they guaranteed to; be newly-allocated. As such, the result of performing direct comparisons; against the location of an object literal (using ``==``, ``!=``, ``<``,; ``<=``, ``>``, or ``>=``) is not well-defined.

Asynchronous Prefetching; The prefetching mechanism uses two new classes (TFilePrefetch; and TFPBlock) to prefetch in advance a block of tree entries. There; is a thread which takes care of actually transferring the blocks and; making them available to the main requesting thread. Therefore, the time; spent by the main thread waiting for the data before processing considerably; decreases. Besides the prefetching mechanisms there is also a local; caching option which can be enabled by the user. Both capabilities are; disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled by the user. In order to enable the prefetching the user must set the rootrc environment; variable TFile.AsyncPrefetching as follows:; gEnv->SetValue(""TFile.AsyncPrefetching"", 1). Only when the; prefetching is enabled can the user set the local cache directory in; which the file transferred will be saved. For subsequent reads of the; same file the system will use the local copy of the file from cache.; To set up a local cache directory, the client can use the following commands:.

The TFilePrefetch class is responsible for actually reading; and storing the requests received from the main thread. It also creates; the working thread which will transfer all the information. Apart from; managing the block requests, it also deals with caching the blocks on; the local machine and retrieving them when necessary.

Performance,"e format; version. Versions 0, 1 and 2 are supported at this time. The difference between; version 0 and 1 is in the encoding of instruction operands in; each `FUNCTION_BLOCK`_. In version 0, each value defined by an instruction is assigned an ID; unique to the function. Function-level value IDs are assigned starting from; ``NumModuleValues`` since they share the same namespace as module-level; values. The value enumerator resets after each function. When a value is; an operand of an instruction, the value ID is used to represent the operand.; For large functions or large modules, these operand values can be large. The encoding in version 1 attempts to avoid large operand values; in common cases. Instead of using the value ID directly, operands are; encoded as relative to the current instruction. Thus, if an operand; is the value defined by the previous instruction, the operand; will be encoded as 1. For example, instead of. .. code-block:: none. #n = load #n-1; #n+1 = icmp eq #n, #const0; br #n+1, label #(bb1), label #(bb2). version 1 will encode the instructions as. .. code-block:: none. #n = load #1; #n+1 = icmp eq #1, (#n+1)-#const0; br #1, label #(bb1), label #(bb2). Note in the example that operands which are constants also use; the relative encoding, while operands like basic block labels; do not use the relative encoding. Forward references will result in a negative value.; This can be inefficient, as operands are normally encoded; as unsigned VBRs. However, forward references are rare, except in the; case of phi instructions. For phi instructions, operands are encoded as; `Signed VBRs`_ to deal with forward references. In version 2, the meaning of module records ``FUNCTION``, ``GLOBALVAR``,; ``ALIAS``, ``IFUNC`` and ``COMDAT`` change such that the first two operands; specify an offset and size of a string in a string table (see `STRTAB_BLOCK; Contents`_), the function name is removed from the ``FNENTRY`` record in the; value symbol table, and the top-level `",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BitCodeFormat.rst:24216,load,load,24216,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BitCodeFormat.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BitCodeFormat.rst,1,['load'],['load']

There; are also a lot of calls to TGeoVolume::AddNode() that I do not understand."". **A:** A volume is positioned inside another one by using this; method. The relative geometrical transformation as well as a copy number; must be specified. When positioned, a volume becomes a ""node"" of; its container and a new object of the class TGeoNode is; automatically created. This method is therefore the key element for the; creation of a hierarchical link between two volumes. As it will be; described further on in this document, there are few other methods; performing similar actions, but let us keep things simple for the time; being. In addition, notice that there are some visualization-related; calls in the example followed by a final TGeoVolume::Draw() call for; the top volume. These are explained in details in the section; ""Visualization Settings and Attributes"". At this point, you will; probably like to see how this geometry looks like.

Performance,"e hot trace is less than 10% of the number of; iterations. LLC has been taught to recognize llvm_first_trigger() calls and NOT; generate saves and restores of caller-saved registers around these; calls. Phase behavior; --------------. We turn off llvm_first_trigger() calls with NOPs, but this would hide; phase behavior from us (when some funcs/traces stop being hot and; others become hot.). We have a SIGALRM timer that counts time for us. Every time we get a; SIGALRM we look at our priority queue of locations where we have; removed llvm_first_trigger() calls. Each location is inserted along; with a time when we will next turn instrumentation back on for that; call site. If the time has arrived for a particular call site, we pop; that off the prio. queue and turn instrumentation back on for that; call site. Generating traces; -----------------. When we finally generate an optimized trace we first copy the code; into the trace cache. This leaves us with 3 copies of the code: the; original code, the instrumented code, and the optimized trace. The; optimized trace does not have instrumentation. The original code and; the instrumented code are modified to have a branch to the trace; cache, where the optimized traces are kept. We copy the code from the original to the instrumentation version; by tracing the LLVM-to-Machine code basic block map and then copying; each machine code basic block we think is in the hot region into the; trace cache. Then we instrument that code. The process is similar for; generating the final optimized trace; we copy the same basic blocks; because we might need to put in fixup code for exit BBs. LLVM basic blocks are not typically used in the Reoptimizer except; for the mapping information. We are restricted to using single instructions to branch between the; original code, trace, and instrumented code.

These may be able to be combined with the memory model ``s_waitcnt``; instructions as described above. The AMDGPU backend supports the following memory models:.

Only a fence specifying both global and; local address space, and seq_cst instructions join the relationships.

However, optimizations can often be; done to eliminate the additional ``s_waitcnt`` instructions when there are; no intervening memory instructions which access the corresponding address; space.

Performance,"e languages: C++ is much harder to parse, but once; parsed, it is much easier to optimize. Consequently, individual calls to; ROOT are typically faster from `PyROOT`, whereas loops are typically; slower. When programming in Python, the modus operandi is to consider; performance generally ""good enough"" on the outset, and when it turns out; that, it is not good enough; the performance critical part is converted; into C/C++ in an extension module. The school of thought where; pre-mature optimization is the root of all evil should find this way of; working very satisfying. In addition, if you look at their history, you; will see that many of the standard Python modules have followed this; path. Your code should always make maximum use of ROOT facilities; such that; most of the time is spending in compiled code. This goes even for very; simple things: e.g. do not compute invariant masses in Python, use; **`TLorentzVector`** instead. Moreover, before you start optimizing,; make sure that you have run a profiler to find out where the bottlenecks; are. Some performance, without cost in terms of programmer effort, may; be gained by using `psyco`, see the next link:; <http://psyco.sourceforge.net>, a Python just in time compiler (JIT).; Note, however, that `psyco` is limited to Intel i386 CPUs. Since `psyco`; optimizes Python, not `PyROOT` calls; it generally does not improve; performance that much if most of your code consists of ROOT API calls.; Mathematical computations in Python, on the other hand, benefit a lot. Every call to a Python member function results in a lookup of that; member function and an association of this method with `'self'`.; Furthermore, a temporary object is created during this process that is; discarded after the method call. In inner loops, it may be worth your; while (up to 30%), to short-cut this process by looking up and binding; the method before the loop, and discarding it afterwards.

Performance,"e native ``__weak`` support to ensure; calling convention compatibility, this transfer is always handled; automatically by the compiler. .. admonition:: Rationale. In earlier releases, when non-trivial ownership was only permitted; on fields in Objective-C++, the ABI used for such classes was the; ordinary ABI for non-trivial C++ classes, which passes arguments and; returns indirectly and does not transfer responsibility for arguments.; When support for Objective-C structs was added, it was decided to; change to the current ABI for three reasons:. - It permits ARC / non-ARC compatibility for structs containing only; ``__strong`` references, as long as the non-ARC side is careful about; transferring ownership. - It avoids unnecessary indirection for sufficiently small types that; the C ABI would prefer to pass in registers. - Given that struct arguments must be produced at +1 to satisfy C's; semantics of initializing the local parameter variable, transferring; ownership of that copy to the callee is generally better for ARC; optimization, since otherwise there will be releases in the caller; that are much harder to pair with transfers in the callee. Breaking compatibility with existing Objective-C++ structures was; considered an acceptable cost, as most Objective-C++ code does not have; binary-compatibility requirements. Any existing code which cannot accept; this compatibility break, which is necessarily Objective-C++, should; force the use of the standard C++ ABI by declaring an empty (but; non-defaulted) destructor. .. _arc.ownership.inference:. Ownership inference; -------------------. .. _arc.ownership.inference.variables:. Objects; ^^^^^^^. If an object is declared with retainable object owner type, but without an; explicit ownership qualifier, its type is implicitly adjusted to have; ``__strong`` qualification.

Performance,"e object editor; should be the object class name concatenated with the word `‘Editor'`. (c) Provide a default constructor. (d) Use the signals/slots communication mechanism for event processing. (e) Implement the virtual method `SetModel(TObject *obj)` where all; widgets are set with the current object's attributes. This method is; called when the editor receives a signal from the canvas saying that an; object is the selected. (f) Implement all necessary slots and connect them to appropriate; signals that GUI widgets send out. The GUI classes in ROOT are developed; to emit signals whenever they change a state that others might be; interested. As we noted already, the signals/slots communication; mechanism allows total independence of the interacting classes. #### Creation and Destruction. GED-frames are constructed during traversal of class hierarchy of the; selected object, executed from method **`TGedEditor`**`::SetModel()`.; When a new object of a different class is selected, the unneeded; GED-frames are cached in memory for potential reuse. The frames are; deleted automatically when the editor is closed. Note: A deep cleanup is assumed for all frames put into the editor. This; implies:. - do not share the layout-hints among GUI components;. - do not delete child widgets in the destructor as this is done; automatically. #### Using Several Tabs. Sometimes you might need to use several tabs to organize properly your; class-editor. Each editor tab is a resource shared among all the; class-editors. Tabs must be created from the constructor of your; editor-class by using the method:. ``` {.cpp}; TGVerticalFrame* TGedFrame::CreateEditorTabSubFrame(const Text_t *name),; ```. It returns a pointer to a new tab container frame ready for use in your; class. If you need to hide/show this frame depending on the object's; status, you should store it in a data member.

Performance,"e of the most powerful features of LLVM is its library-first design mentality; and the way you can compose a wide variety of tools using different portions of; LLVM. Even in this situation using *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* is not supported. If you; want to distribute LLVM as a shared library for use in a tool, the recommended; method is using *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB*, and you can use *LLVM_DYLIB_COMPONENTS*; to configure which LLVM components are part of libLLVM.; Note: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* is not available on Windows. Options for Optimizing LLVM; ===========================. There are four main build optimizations that our CMake build system supports.; When performing a bootstrap build it is not beneficial to do anything other than; setting *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* to ``Release`` for the stage-1 compiler. This is; because the more intensive optimizations are expensive to perform and the; stage-1 compiler is thrown away. All of the further options described should be; set on the stage-2 compiler either using a CMake cache file, or by prefixing the; option with *BOOTSTRAP_*. The first and simplest to use is the compiler optimization level by setting the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* option. The main values of interest are ``Release`` or; ``RelWithDebInfo``. By default the ``Release`` option uses the ``-O3``; optimization level, and ``RelWithDebInfo`` uses ``-O2``. If you want to generate; debug information and use ``-O3`` you can override the; *CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO* option for C and CXX.; DistributionExample.cmake does this. Another easy to use option is Link-Time-Optimization. You can set the; *LLVM_ENABLE_LTO* option on your stage-2 build to ``Thin`` or ``Full`` to enable; building LLVM with LTO. These options will significantly increase link time of; the binaries in the distribution, but it will create much faster binaries. This; option should not be used if your distribution includes static archives, as the; objects inside the archive will be LLVM bitcode, which is not po",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst:7977,cache,cache,7977,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,1,['cache'],['cache']

Of course, if one; wants to access a plugin library directly, it has to be explicitly; linked. An example of a plugin library is `libMinuit`. To create and; fill histograms you need to link `libHist.so`. If the code has a call; to fit the histogram, the ""fitter"" will dynamically load libMinuit if; it is not yet loaded. #### Plugins: Runtime Library Dependencies for Linking. plugin manager The Plugin Manager **`TPluginManager`** allows; postponing library dependencies to runtime: a plugin library will only; be loaded when it is needed. Non-plugins will need to be linked, and; are thus loaded at start-up. Plugins are defined by a base class (e.g.; **`TFile`**) that will be implemented in a plugin, a tag used to; identify the plugin (e.g. `^rfio:` as part of the protocol string),; the plugin class of which an object will be created; (e.g. **`TRFIOFile`**), the library to be loaded (in short; `libRFIO.so` to RFIO), and the constructor to be called (e.g.; ""`TRFIOFile()`""). This can be specified in the `.rootrc` which already; contains many plugin definitions, or by calls to; `gROOT->GetPluginManager()->AddHandler()`. #### Library AutoLoading. When using a class in Cling, e.g. in an interpreted source file, ROOT; will automatically load the library that defines this class. On; start-up, ROOT parses all files ending on `.rootmap` rootmap that are; in one of the `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or `$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` for `MacOS`,; or `$PATH` for `Windows`). They contain class names and the library; names that the class depends on. After reading them, ROOT knows which; classes are available, and which libraries to load for them. When `TSystem::Load(""ALib"")` is called, ROOT uses this information to; determine which libraries `libALib.so` depends on. It will load these; libraries first.

Other useful patterns may be to fold the load into the `or` instruction itself; at the cost of a register-to-register copy. There are some challenges with deploying this approach:; 1. Many loads on x86 are folded into other instructions. Separating them would; add very significant and costly register pressure with prohibitive; performance cost.; 1. Loads may not target a general purpose register requiring extra instructions; to map the state value into the correct register class, and potentially more; expensive instructions to mask the value in some way.; 1. The flags registers on x86 are very likely to be live, and challenging to; preserve cheaply.; 1. There are many more values loaded than pointers & indices used for loads. As; a consequence, hardening the result of a load requires substantially more; instructions than hardening the address of the load (see below). Despite these challenges, hardening the result of the load critically allows; the load to proceed and thus has dramatically less impact on the total; speculative / out-of-order potential of the execution. There are also several; interesting techniques to try and mitigate these challenges and make hardening; the results of loads viable in at least some cases. However, we generally; expect to fall back when unprofitable from hardening the loaded value to the; next approach of hardening the address itself. ###### Loads folded into data-invariant operations can be hardened after the operation. The first key to making this feasible is to recognize that many operations on; x86 are ""data-invariant"".

The; bounds check expression has a ``BoundsCheckKind`` to indicate the kind of checks; and has the additional sub-expressions that are necessary to perform the check; according to the kind. Paired assignment check; =======================. ``-fbounds-safety`` enforces that variables or fields related with the same; external bounds annotation (e.g., ``buf`` and ``count`` related with; ``__counted_by`` in the example below) must be updated side by side within the; same basic block and without side effect in between. .. code-block:: c. typedef struct {; int *__counted_by(count) buf; size_t count;; } sized_buf_t;. void alloc_buf(sized_buf_t *sbuf, sized_t nelems) {; sbuf->buf = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * nelems);; sbuf->count = nelems;; }.

Thus, the API of each software library is only parsed once, reducing the *M x N* compilation problem to an *M + N* problem. * **Fragility**: Each module is parsed as a standalone entity, so it has a consistent preprocessor environment.

For example, to run the ``print-function-names`` plugin over a source file in; clang, first build the plugin, and then call clang with the plugin from the; source tree:. .. code-block:: console. $ export BD=/path/to/build/directory; $ (cd $BD && make PrintFunctionNames ); $ clang++ -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_DEBUG -D__STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS \; -D__STDC_FORMAT_MACROS -D__STDC_LIMIT_MACROS -D_GNU_SOURCE \; -I$BD/tools/clang/include -Itools/clang/include -I$BD/include -Iinclude \; tools/clang/tools/clang-check/ClangCheck.cpp -fsyntax-only \; -Xclang -load -Xclang $BD/lib/PrintFunctionNames.so -Xclang \; -plugin -Xclang print-fns.

Note: if the alignment is not greater or; equal to the size of the `<value>` type, the atomic operation is likely to; require a lock and have poor performance. ``!nontemporal`` does not have any; defined semantics for atomic stores. The optional constant ``align`` argument specifies the alignment of the; operation (that is, the alignment of the memory address). It is the; responsibility of the code emitter to ensure that the alignment information is; correct. Overestimating the alignment results in undefined behavior.; Underestimating the alignment may produce less efficient code. An alignment of; 1 is always safe. The maximum possible alignment is ``1 << 32``. An alignment; value higher than the size of the loaded type implies memory up to the; alignment value bytes can be safely loaded without trapping in the default; address space. Access of the high bytes can interfere with debugging tools, so; should not be accessed if the function has the ``sanitize_thread`` or; ``sanitize_address`` attributes.

However there are pros and cons to the two approaches that make it less than simple which register format to pick. There are two options:. 1. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LDR`` instruction.; 2. The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LD1`` instruction. Because ``LD1 == LDR + REV`` and similarly ``LDR == LD1 + REV`` (on a big endian system), we can simulate either type of load with the other type of load plus a ``REV`` instruction. So we're not deciding which instructions to use, but which format to use (which will then influence which instruction is best to use). ..

LLVM IR has first class vector types. In LLVM IR, the zero'th element of a vector resides at the lowest memory address. The optimizer relies on this property in certain areas, for example when concatenating vectors together. The intention is for arrays and vectors to have identical memory layouts - ``[4 x i8]`` and ``<4 x i8>`` should be represented the same in memory. Without this property there would be many special cases that the optimizer would have to cleverly handle. Use of ``LDR`` would break this lane ordering property. This doesn't preclude the use of ``LDR``, but we would have to do one of two things:. 1. Insert a ``REV`` instruction to reverse the lane order after every ``LDR``.; 2.

For that, LLVM can serialize the remarks produced for each compilation unit to; a file that can be consumed later. By default, the format of the serialized remarks is :ref:`YAML; <yamlremarks>`, and it can be accompanied by a :ref:`section <remarkssection>`; in the object files to easily retrieve it. :doc:`llc <CommandGuide/llc>` and :doc:`opt <CommandGuide/opt>` support the; following options:. ``Basic options``. .. option:: -pass-remarks-output=<filename>.

Performance,"e short summary of this chapter is that we'll go through the; various things you have to add to a programming language to; support debug info, and how you translate that into DWARF. Caveat: For now we can't debug via the JIT, so we'll need to compile; our program down to something small and standalone. As part of this; we'll make a few modifications to the running of the language and; how programs are compiled. This means that we'll have a source file; with a simple program written in Kaleidoscope rather than the; interactive JIT. It does involve a limitation that we can only; have one ""top level"" command at a time to reduce the number of; changes necessary. Here's the sample program we'll be compiling:. .. code-block:: python. def fib(x); if x < 3 then; 1; else; fib(x-1)+fib(x-2);. fib(10). Why is this a hard problem?; ===========================. Debug information is a hard problem for a few different reasons - mostly; centered around optimized code. First, optimization makes keeping source; locations more difficult. In LLVM IR we keep the original source location; for each IR level instruction on the instruction. Optimization passes; should keep the source locations for newly created instructions, but merged; instructions only get to keep a single location - this can cause jumping; around when stepping through optimized programs. Secondly, optimization; can move variables in ways that are either optimized out, shared in memory; with other variables, or difficult to track. For the purposes of this; tutorial we're going to avoid optimization (as you'll see with one of the; next sets of patches). Ahead-of-Time Compilation Mode; ==============================. To highlight only the aspects of adding debug information to a source; language without needing to worry about the complexities of JIT debugging; we're going to make a few changes to Kaleidoscope to support compiling; the IR emitted by the front end into a simple standalone program that; you can execute, debug,",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl09.rst:1775,optimiz,optimization,1775,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl09.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl09.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

M does not depend; on any external library. In its minimal usage the user must only provide; an implementation of the FCNBase class to M and parameters and; uncertainties in form of std::vector containers. ### Memory allocation and thread safety ###. Differently to the version of M , the version has its own memory manager; (StackAllocator. The user can select between the standard dynamic memory; allocation and deallocation (default) and performance-optimized; stack–like allocation (optional). However, the library is not thread; save using stack–allocation. ### M parameters ###. Differently to the version of M there is no limit on the number of; parameters, variable or non-variable.

There is no; protection against an upper limit on the number of parameters, however; the ""technological"" limitations of M can be seen around a maximum of 15; free parameters at a time. ## Interference with other packages ##. The new M has been designed to interfere as little as possible with; other programs or packages which may be loaded at the same time. M is; thread safe by default. Optionally the user can select a different way; of dynamically allocating memory in the class StackAllacator for M , in; which case (and after an entire recompilation of the whole library) the; thread safety is lost. ## Floating-point precision ##.

Performance,"e systems is that a ; compiler may fall in anywhere in a ""continuum of compilation"" to do its ; job. On one side, scripting languages statically compile nothing and ; dynamically compile (or equivalently, interpret) everything. On the far ; other side, traditional static compilers process everything statically and ; nothing dynamically. These approaches have typically been seen as a ; tradeoff between performance and portability. On a deeper level, however, ; there are two reasons that optimal system performance may be obtained by a; system somewhere in between these two extremes: Dynamic application ; behavior and social constraints. From a technical perspective, pure static compilation cannot ever give ; optimal performance in all cases, because applications have varying dynamic; behavior that the static compiler cannot take into consideration. Even ; compilers that support profile guided optimization generate poor code in ; the real world, because using such optimization tunes that application ; to one particular usage pattern, whereas real programs (as opposed to ; benchmarks) often have several different usage patterns. On a social level, static compilation is a very shortsighted solution to ; the performance problem. Instruction set architectures (ISAs) continuously ; evolve, and each implementation of an ISA (a processor) must choose a set ; of tradeoffs that make sense in the market context that it is designed for. ; With every new processor introduced, the vendor faces two fundamental ; problems: First, there is a lag time between when a processor is introduced ; to when compilers generate quality code for the architecture. Secondly, ; even when compilers catch up to the new architecture there is often a large ; body of legacy code that was compiled for previous generations and will ; not or can not be upgraded.

We turn off llvm_first_trigger() calls with NOPs, but this would hide; phase behavior from us (when some funcs/traces stop being hot and; others become hot.).

The `Wrapper`s can be implemented for different kinds of algorithms, or with different kinds of optimization ""back-ends"" in mind.; One implementation of each is ready for use in `RooFit` currently:. 1. `LikelihoodSerial` is more or less simply a rewrite of the existing serial calculation of a `RooNLLVar`.; 2. `LikelihoodGradientJob` calculates the partial derivatives or the gradient in parallel on multiple CPUs/cores, based on `RooFit::MultiProcess`, which is a fork-based multi-processing task execution framework with dynamic load balancing. Other possible implementations could use the GPU or external tools like TensorFlow. The coupling of all these classes to `RooMinimizer` is made via the `MinuitFcnGrad` class, which owns the `Wrappers` that calculate the likelihood components. Note: a second `LikelihoodWrapper` class called `LikelihoodJob` is also available.; This class emulates the existing `NumCPU(>1)` functionality of the `RooAbsTestStatistic` tree, which is implemented based on `RooRealMPFE`.; This class is not yet thoroughly tested and should not be considered production ready. ### Usage example: `MultiProcess` enabled parallel gradient calculator.

The; resulting PCH file contains the serialized form of the compiler's internal; representation after it has completed parsing and semantic analysis. The PCH; file can then be used as a prefix header with the `-include-pch`; option:. .. code-block:: bash. $ clang -cc1 -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test.s. Design Philosophy; -----------------. Precompiled headers are meant to improve overall compile times for projects, so; the design of precompiled headers is entirely driven by performance concerns.; The use case for precompiled headers is relatively simple: when there is a; common set of headers that is included in nearly every source file in the; project, we *precompile* that bundle of headers into a single precompiled; header (PCH file). Then, when compiling the source files in the project, we; load the PCH file first (as a prefix header), which acts as a stand-in for that; bundle of headers. A precompiled header implementation improves performance when:. * Loading the PCH file is significantly faster than re-parsing the bundle of; headers stored within the PCH file. Thus, a precompiled header design; attempts to minimize the cost of reading the PCH file. Ideally, this cost; should not vary with the size of the precompiled header file. * The cost of generating the PCH file initially is not so large that it; counters the per-source-file performance improvement due to eliminating the; need to parse the bundled headers in the first place. This is particularly; important on multi-core systems, because PCH file generation serializes the; build when all compilations require the PCH file to be up-to-date. Modules, as implemented in Clang, use the same mechanisms as precompiled; headers to save a serialized AST file (one per module) and use those AST; modules. From an implementation standpoint, modules ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst:1597,load,load,1597,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,1,['load'],['load']
Performance,"e the requested PC sections. While relying on LLVM IR metadata to request PC sections makes the above; guarantee relatively trivial, propagation of metadata through the optimization; and code generation pipeline has the following guarantees. Metadata Propagation; --------------------. In general, LLVM *does not make any guarantees* about preserving IR metadata; (attached to an ``Instruction``) through IR transformations. When using PC; sections metadata, this guarantee is unchanged, and ``!pcsections`` metadata is; remains *optional* until lowering to machine IR (MIR). Note for Code Generation; ------------------------. As with other LLVM IR metadata, there are no requirements for LLVM IR; transformation passes to preserve ``!pcsections`` metadata, with the following; exceptions:. * The ``AtomicExpandPass`` shall preserve ``!pcsections`` metadata; according to the below rules 1-4. When translating LLVM IR to MIR, the ``!pcsections`` metadata shall be copied; from the source ``Instruction`` to the target ``MachineInstr`` (set with; ``MachineInstr::setPCSections()``). The instruction selectors and MIR; optimization passes shall preserve PC sections metadata as follows:. 1. Replacements will preserve PC sections metadata of the replaced; instruction. 2. Duplications will preserve PC sections metadata of the copied; instruction. 3. Merging will preserve PC sections metadata of one of the two; instructions (no guarantee on which instruction's metadata is used). 4. Deletions will loose PC sections metadata. This is similar to debug info, and the ``BuildMI()`` helper provides a; convenient way to propagate debug info and ``!pcsections`` metadata in the; ``MIMetadata`` bundle. Note for Metadata Users; -----------------------. Use cases for ``!pcsections`` metadata should either be fully tolerant to; missing metadata, or the passes inserting ``!pcsections`` metadata should run; *after* all LLVM IR optimization passes to preserve the metadata until being; translated to MIR.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/PCSectionsMetadata.rst:3873,optimiz,optimization,3873,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/PCSectionsMetadata.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/PCSectionsMetadata.rst,2,['optimiz'],['optimization']
Performance,"e thread. It is possible for the compiler to use both SIMT concurrency and iteration; concurrency techniques in the code of a single source language thread. Therefore, a DWARF operation is required to denote the current concurrent; iteration instance, much like ``DW_OP_push_object_address`` denotes the current; object. See ``DW_OP_LLVM_push_iteration`` in; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-literal-operations`. In addition, a way is needed for the compiler to communicate how many source; language loop iterations are executing concurrently. See; ``DW_AT_LLVM_iterations`` in :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-low-level-information`. 2.20 DWARF Operation to Create Runtime Overlay Composite Location Description; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------. It is common in SIMD vectorization for the compiler to generate code that; promotes portions of an array into vector registers. For example, if the; hardware has vector registers with 8 elements, and 8 wide SIMD instructions, the; compiler may vectorize a loop so that is executes 8 iterations concurrently for; each vectorized loop iteration. On the first iteration of the generated vectorized loop, iterations 0 to 7 of; the source language loop will be executed using SIMD instructions. Then on the; next iteration of the generated vectorized loop, iteration 8 to 15 will be; executed, and so on. If the source language loop accesses an array element based on the loop; iteration index, the compiler may read the element into a register for the; duration of that iteration. Next iteration it will read the next element into; the register, and so on. With SIMD, this generalizes to the compiler reading; array elements 0 to 7 into a vector register on the first vectorized loop; iteration, then array elements 8 to 15 on the next iteration, and so on. The DWARF location description for the array needs to express that all elements; are in memory, except the slice that has been promoted to the vector register.; The starting positio",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst:35233,concurren,concurrently,35233,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,1,['concurren'],['concurrently']

Frontends generating atomic instructions generally need to be aware of the; target to some degree; atomic instructions are guaranteed to be lock-free, and; therefore an instruction which is wider than the target natively supports can be; impossible to generate. .. _Atomic orderings:. Atomic orderings; ================. In order to achieve a balance between performance and necessary guarantees,; there are six levels of atomicity. They are listed in order of strength; each; level includes all the guarantees of the previous level except for; Acquire/Release. (See also `LangRef Ordering <LangRef.html#ordering>`_.). .. _NotAtomic:. NotAtomic; ---------. NotAtomic is the obvious, a load or store which is not atomic. (This isn't; really a level of atomicity, but is listed here for comparison.) This is; essentially a regular load or store. If there is a race on a given memory; location, loads from that location return undef. Relevant standard; This is intended to match shared variables in C/C++, and to be used in any; other context where memory access is necessary, and a race is impossible. (The; precise definition is in `LangRef Memory Model <LangRef.html#memmodel>`_.). Notes for frontends; The rule is essentially that all memory accessed with basic loads and stores; by multiple threads should be protected by a lock or other synchronization;; otherwise, you are likely to run into undefined behavior. If your frontend is; for a ""safe"" language like Java, use Unordered to load and store any shared; variable. Note that NotAtomic volatile loads and stores are not properly; atomic; do not try to use them as a substitute.

You can get the include path by typing:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .include; ```. You can append to the include path by typing:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .include $HOME/mypackage/include; ```. In a script you can append to the include path:. ``` {.cpp}; gSystem->AddIncludePath("" -I$HOME/mypackage/include ""); ```. You can also overwrite the existing include path:. ``` {.cpp}; gSystem->SetIncludePath("" -I$HOME/mypackage/include ""); ```. The `$ROOTSYS/include` directory is automatically appended to the; include path, so you do not have to worry about including it. To add; library that should be used during linking of the shared library use; something like:. ``` {.cpp}; gSystem->AddLinkedLibs(""-L/my/path -lanylib"");; ```. This is especially useful for static libraries. For shared ones you; can also simply load them before trying to compile the script:. ``` {.cpp}; gSystem->Load(""mydir/mylib"");; ```. ACLiC uses the directive `fMakeSharedLibs` to create the shared; library. If loading the shared library fails, it tries to output a; list of missing symbols by creating an executable (on some platforms; like OSF, this does not HAVE to be an executable) containing the; script. It uses the directive `fMakeExe` to do so. For both; directives, before passing them to `TSystem::Exec()`, it expands the; variables `$SourceFiles`, `$SharedLib`, `$LibName`, `$IncludePath`,; `$LinkedLibs`, `$ExeName `and` $ObjectFiles`. See `SetMakeSharedLib()`; for more information on those variables. When the file being passed to; ACLiC is on a read only file system, ACLiC warns the user and creates; the library in a temporary directory:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L readonly/t.C++; Warning in <ACLiC>: /scratch/aclic/subs/./readonly is not writable!; Warning in <ACLiC>: Output will be written to /tmp; Info in <TUnixSystem::ACLiC",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Cling.md:17211,load,load,17211,documentation/users-guide/Cling.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Cling.md,1,['load'],['load']

Performance,"e, there is; a problem with the following scenario: a class `Foo` has a; **`TClonesArray`** of `Bar` objects the `Foo` object is written with; `split=0` to `Tree` `T1`. In this case the `StreamerInfo` for the class; `Bar` is created in optimized mode in such a way that data members of; the same type are written as an array improving the I/O performance. In; a new program, `T1` is read and a new `Tree` `T2` is created with the; object `Foo` in `split > 1`. When the `T2 `branch is created, the `StreamerInfo` for the class `Bar`; is created with no optimization (mandatory for the split mode). The; optimized Bar `StreamerInfo` is going to be used to read the; **`TClonesArray`** in `T1`. The result will be `Bar` objects with data; member values not in the right sequence. The solution to this problem is; to call `BypassStreamer(kFALSE)` for the **`TClonesArray`**. In this; case, the normal `Bar::Streamer` function will be called. The; `Bar::Streamer` function works OK independently if the `Bar`; `StreamerInfo `had been generated in optimized mode or not. ## Pointers and References in Persistency. An object pointer as a data member presents a challenge to the streaming; software. If the object pointed to is saved every time, it could create; circular dependencies and consume a large amount of disk space. The; network of references must be preserved on disk and recreated upon; reading the file. If you use independent I/O operations for pointers and their referenced; objects you can use the **`TRef`** class. Later in this section is an; example that compares disk space, memory usage, and I/O times of C++; pointers and **`TRef`**`s`. In general, a **`TRef`** is faster than C++; but the advantage of a C++ pointer is that it is already C++. ### Streaming C++ Pointers. When ROOT encounters a pointer data member it calls the `Streamer` of; the object and labels it with a unique object identifier. The object; identifier is unique for one I/O operation.

Possible other mathematical problems are the; following:. - Excessive numerical round off - be especially careful of; exponential and factorial functions which get big very quickly and; lose accuracy. - Starting too far from the solution - the function may have; unphysical local minima, especially at infinity in some variables. ## Minuit2 Package. `Minuit2` is a new object-oriented implementation, written in C++, of; the popular `MINUIT` minimization package.

A trick to prebuild all modules required for our source file in one command is to generate implicit modules while using the ``-fdisable-module-hash`` option. .. code-block:: sh. rm -rf prebuilt ; mkdir prebuilt; clang -cc1 -emit-obj use.c -fmodules -fimplicit-module-maps -fmodules-cache-path=prebuilt -fdisable-module-hash; ls prebuilt/*.pcm; # prebuilt/A.pcm prebuilt/B.pcm.

So we need to maintain multiple versions of prebuilt modules. We can do so using a manual module mapping, or pointing to a different prebuilt module cache path. For example:. .. code-block:: sh. rm -rf prebuilt ; mkdir prebuilt ; rm -rf prebuilt_a ; mkdir prebuilt_a; clang -cc1 -emit-obj use.c -fmodules -fimplicit-module-maps -fmodules-cache-path=prebuilt -fdisable-module-hash; clang -cc1 -emit-obj use.c -fmodules -fimplicit-module-maps -fmodules-cache-path=prebuilt_a -fdisable-module-hash -DENABLE_A; clang -cc1 -emit-obj use.c -fmodules -fimplicit-module-maps -fprebuilt-module-path=prebuilt; clang -cc1 -emit-obj use.c -fmodules -fimplicit-module-maps -fprebuilt-module-path=prebuilt_a -DENABLE_A.

Performance,"e-time?; The obvious answer is compile-time: see the performance differences between; C++ and Python, for example.; Obvious, but completely wrong, however.; In fact, when it comes to Python, it is even the `wrong question.`. Everything in Python is run-time: modules, classes, functions, etc. are all; run-time constructs.; A Python module that defines a class is a set of instructions to the Python; interpreter that lead to the construction of the desired class object.; A C/C++ extension module that defines a class does the same thing by calling; a succession of Python interpreter Application Programming Interfaces (APIs;; the exact same that Python uses itself internally).; If you use a compile-time binder such as `SWIG`_ or `pybind11`_ to bind a C++; class, then what gets compiled is the series of API calls necessary to; construct a Python-side equivalent at `run-time` (when the module gets; loaded), not the Python class object.; In short, whether a binding is created at ""compile-time"" or at run-time has; no measurable bearing on performance. What does affect performance is the overhead to cross the language barrier.; This consists of unboxing Python objects to extract or convert the underlying; objects or data to something that matches what C++ expects; overload; resolution based on the unboxed arguments; offset calculations; and finally; the actual dispatch.; As a practical matter, overload resolution is the most costly part, followed; by the unboxing and conversion.; Best performance is achieved by specialization of the paths through the; run-time: recognize early the case at hand and select an optimized path.; For that reason, `PyPy`_ is so fast: JIT-ed traces operate on unboxed objects; and resolved overloads are baked into the trace, incurring no further cost.; Similarly, this is why pybind11 is so slow: its code generation is the C++; compiler's template engine, so complex path selection and specialization is; very hard to do in a performance-portable way.

Here are some suggestions to debugging your pass; with GDB. For sake of discussion, I'm going to assume that you are debugging a; transformation invoked by :program:`opt`, although nothing described here; depends on that. Setting a breakpoint in your pass; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. First thing you do is start gdb on the opt process:. .. code-block:: console. $ gdb opt; GNU gdb 5.0; Copyright 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.; GDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are; welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions.; Type ""show copying"" to see the conditions.; There is absolutely no warranty for GDB.

Be patient. Since we cannot set a breakpoint in our pass yet; (the shared object isn't loaded until runtime), we must execute the process,; and have it stop before it invokes our pass, but after it has loaded the shared; object. The most foolproof way of doing this is to set a breakpoint in; ``PassManager::run`` and then run the process with the arguments you want:. .. code-block:: console. $ (gdb) break llvm::PassManager::run; Breakpoint 1 at 0x2413bc: file Pass.cpp, line 70.; (gdb) run test.bc -load $(LLVMTOP)/llvm/Debug+Asserts/lib/[libname].so -[passoption]; Starting program: opt test.bc -load $(LLVMTOP)/llvm/Debug+Asserts/lib/[libname].so -[passoption]; Breakpoint 1, PassManager::run (this=0xffbef174, M=@0x70b298) at Pass.cpp:70; 70 bool PassManager::run(Module &M) { return PM->run(M); }; (gdb).

Specifically, when compiling for the; ELF V1 ABI, ``<target>`` is the function-descriptor address normally used as; the C/C++ function-pointer representation. Requesting zero patch point arguments is valid. In this case, all; variable operands are handled just like; ``llvm.experimental.stackmap.*``. The difference is that space will; still be reserved for patching, a call will be emitted, and a return; value is allowed. The location of the arguments are not normally recorded in the stack; map because they are already fixed by the calling convention. The; remaining ``live values`` will have their location recorded, which; could be a register, stack location, or constant. A special calling; convention has been introduced for use with stack maps, anyregcc,; which forces the arguments to be loaded into registers but allows; those register to be dynamically allocated. These argument registers; will have their register locations recorded in the stack map in; addition to the remaining ``live values``. The patch point also emits nops to cover at least ``<numBytes>`` of; instruction encoding space. Hence, the client must ensure that; ``<numBytes>`` is enough to encode a call to the target address on the; supported targets.

This CMake invocation configures the stage1 host compiler, and sets; CLANG_BOOTSTRAP_CMAKE_ARGS to pass the Apple-stage2.cmake cache script to the; stage2 configuration step. When you build the stage2-distribution target it builds the minimal stage1; compiler and required tools, then configures and builds the stage2 compiler; based on the settings in Apple-stage2.cmake.

An instruction in the timeline view is identified by a pair of indices, where; the first index identifies an iteration, and the second index is the; instruction index (i.e., where it appears in the code sequence). Since this; example was generated using 3 iterations: ``-iterations=3``, the iteration; indices range from 0-2 inclusively. Excluding the first and last column, the remaining columns are in cycles.; Cycles are numbered sequentially starting from 0. From the example output above, we know the following:. * Instruction [1,0] was dispatched at cycle 1.; * Instruction [1,0] started executing at cycle 2.; * Instruction [1,0] reached the write back stage at cycle 4.; * Instruction [1,0] was retired at cycle 10. Instruction [1,0] (i.e., vmulps from iteration #1) does not have to wait in the; scheduler's queue for the operands to become available. By the time vmulps is; dispatched, operands are already available, and pipeline JFPU1 is ready to; serve another instruction. So the instruction can be immediately issued on the; JFPU1 pipeline. That is demonstrated by the fact that the instruction only; spent 1cy in the scheduler's queue. There is a gap of 5 cycles between the write-back stage and the retire event.; That is because instructions must retire in program order, so [1,0] has to wait; for [0,2] to be retired first (i.e., it has to wait until cycle 10). In the example, all instructions are in a RAW (Read After Write) dependency; chain.

Rationale: not all memory and resources are managed with reference counts; it; is common for objects to manage private resources in their own, private way.; Typically these resources are completely encapsulated within the object, but; some classes offer their users direct access for efficiency. If ARC is not; aware of methods that return such ""interior"" pointers, its optimizations can; cause the owning object to be reclaimed too soon. This attribute informs ARC; that it must tread lightly. The extension rules are somewhat intentionally vague. The autorelease pool; limit is there to permit a simple implementation to simply retain and; autorelease the receiver. The other limit permits some amount of; optimization. The phrase ""derived from"" is intended to encompass the results; both of pointer transformations, such as casts and arithmetic, and of loading; from such derived pointers; furthermore, it applies whether or not such; derivations are applied directly in the calling code or by other utility code; (for example, the C library routine ``strchr``). However, the implementation; never need account for uses after a return from the code which calls the; method returning an interior pointer. As an exception, no extension is required if the receiver is loaded directly; from a ``__strong`` object with :ref:`precise lifetime semantics; <arc.optimization.precise>`. .. admonition:: Rationale. Implicit autoreleases carry the risk of significantly inflating memory use,; so it's important to provide users a way of avoiding these autoreleases.; Tying this to precise lifetime semantics is ideal, as for local variables; this requires a very explicit annotation, which allows ARC to trust the user; with good cheer. .. _arc.misc.c-retainable:.

The definition generator is given a chance to; produce a definition of the missing symbol(s) before the lookup proceeds. ORC provides the ``DynamicLibrarySearchGenerator`` utility for reflecting symbols; from the process (or a specific dynamic library) for you. For example, to reflect; the whole interface of a runtime library:. .. code-block:: c++. const DataLayout &DL = getDataLayout();; auto &JD = ES.createJITDylib(""main"");. if (auto DLSGOrErr =; DynamicLibrarySearchGenerator::Load(""/path/to/lib""; DL.getGlobalPrefix())); JD.addGenerator(std::move(*DLSGOrErr);; else; return DLSGOrErr.takeError();. // IR added to JD can now link against all symbols exported by the library; // at '/path/to/lib'.; CompileLayer.add(JD, loadModule(...));.

As each materializer completes its work it notifies the JITDylib, which in turn; notifies any query objects that are waiting on the newly materialized; definitions. Each query object maintains a count of the number of symbols that; it is still waiting on, and once this count reaches zero the query object calls; the query handler with a *SymbolMap* (a map of symbol names to addresses); describing the result. If any symbol fails to materialize the query immediately; calls the query handler with an error. The collected materialization units are sent to the ExecutionSession to be; dispatched, and the dispatch behavior can be set by the client. By default each; materializer is run on the calling thread.

Performance,"e] ptr <pointer>, <ty> <cmp>, <ty> <new> [syncscope(""<target-scope>"")] <success ordering> <failure ordering>[, align <alignment>] ; yields { ty, i1 }. Overview:; """""""""""""""""". The '``cmpxchg``' instruction is used to atomically modify memory. It; loads a value in memory and compares it to a given value. If they are; equal, it tries to store a new value into the memory. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". There are three arguments to the '``cmpxchg``' instruction: an address; to operate on, a value to compare to the value currently be at that; address, and a new value to place at that address if the compared values; are equal. The type of '<cmp>' must be an integer or pointer type whose; bit width is a power of two greater than or equal to eight and less; than or equal to a target-specific size limit. '<cmp>' and '<new>' must; have the same type, and the type of '<pointer>' must be a pointer to; that type. If the ``cmpxchg`` is marked as ``volatile``, then the; optimizer is not allowed to modify the number or order of execution of; this ``cmpxchg`` with other :ref:`volatile operations <volatile>`. The success and failure :ref:`ordering <ordering>` arguments specify how this; ``cmpxchg`` synchronizes with other atomic operations. Both ordering parameters; must be at least ``monotonic``, the failure ordering cannot be either; ``release`` or ``acq_rel``. A ``cmpxchg`` instruction can also take an optional; "":ref:`syncscope <syncscope>`"" argument. Note: if the alignment is not greater or equal to the size of the `<value>`; type, the atomic operation is likely to require a lock and have poor; performance. The alignment is only optional when parsing textual IR; for in-memory IR, it is; always present. If unspecified, the alignment is assumed to be equal to the; size of the '<value>' type. Note that this default alignment assumption is; different from the alignment used for the load/store instructions when align; isn't specified. The pointer passed into cmpxchg must have alignment greater ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:426590,optimiz,optimizer,426590,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimizer']
Performance,"e` and `offset` are fixed immediate values. `scale` must be `1`, `2`,; `4`, or `8`, and `offset` can be any 32-bit sign extended value. The exact; computation performed to find the address is then: `%base + (scale * %index) +; offset` under 64-bit 2's complement modular arithmetic. One issue with this approach is that, after hardening, the `%base + (scale *; %index)` subexpression will compute a value near zero (`-1 + (scale * -1)`) and; then a large, positive `offset` will index into memory within the first two; gigabytes of address space. While these offsets are not attacker controlled,; the attacker could chose to attack a load which happens to have the desired; offset and then successfully read memory in that region. This significantly; raises the burden on the attacker and limits the scope of attack but does not; eliminate it. To fully close the attack we must work with the operating system; to preclude mapping memory in the low two gigabytes of address space. ###### 64-bit load checking instructions. We can use the following instruction sequences to check loads. We set up `%r8`; in these examples to hold the special value of `-1` which will be `cmov`ed over; `%rax` in misspeculated paths. Single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```. Two register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the index if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi,%rcx), %edi; ```. This will result in a negative address near zero or in `offset` wrapping the; address space back to a small positive address. Small, negative addresses will; fault in user-mode for most operating systems, but targets which need the high; address space to be user accessible may need to adjust the exact sequence used; above.

Performance,"e`` must be equivalent to sending ``release`` when; one of the autorelease pools currently in scope is popped. It may not throw an; exception. When the semantics call for performing one of these operations on a retainable; object pointer, if that pointer is ``null`` then the effect is a no-op. All of the semantics described in this document are subject to additional; :ref:`optimization rules <arc.optimization>` which permit the removal or; optimization of operations based on local knowledge of data flow. The; semantics describe the high-level behaviors that the compiler implements, not; an exact sequence of operations that a program will be compiled into. .. _arc.objects.operands:. Retainable object pointers as operands and arguments; ----------------------------------------------------. In general, ARC does not perform retain or release operations when simply using; a retainable object pointer as an operand within an expression. This includes:. * loading a retainable pointer from an object with non-weak :ref:`ownership; <arc.ownership>`,; * passing a retainable pointer as an argument to a function or method, and; * receiving a retainable pointer as the result of a function or method call. .. admonition:: Rationale. While this might seem uncontroversial, it is actually unsafe when multiple; expressions are evaluated in ""parallel"", as with binary operators and calls,; because (for example) one expression might load from an object while another; writes to it. However, C and C++ already call this undefined behavior; because the evaluations are unsequenced, and ARC simply exploits that here to; avoid needing to retain arguments across a large number of calls.

This intrinsic is lowered when a coroutine is split into; the start, resume and destroy parts. In the start part, it is a no-op,; in resume and destroy parts, it is replaced with `ret void` instruction and; the rest of the block containing `coro.end` instruction is discarded.; In landing pads it is replaced with an appropriate instruction to unwind to; caller. The handling of coro.end differs depending on whether the target is; using landingpad or WinEH exception model. For landingpad based exception model, it is expected that frontend uses the; `coro.end`_ intrinsic as follows:. .. code-block:: llvm. ehcleanup:; %InResumePart = call i1 @llvm.coro.end(ptr null, i1 true, token none); br i1 %InResumePart, label %eh.resume, label %cleanup.cont. cleanup.cont:; ; rest of the cleanup. eh.resume:; %exn = load ptr, ptr %exn.slot, align 8; %sel = load i32, ptr %ehselector.slot, align 4; %lpad.val = insertvalue { ptr, i32 } undef, ptr %exn, 0; %lpad.val29 = insertvalue { ptr, i32 } %lpad.val, i32 %sel, 1; resume { ptr, i32 } %lpad.val29. The `CoroSpit` pass replaces `coro.end` with ``True`` in the resume functions,; thus leading to immediate unwind to the caller, whereas in start function it; is replaced with ``False``, thus allowing to proceed to the rest of the cleanup; code that is only needed during initial invocation of the coroutine. For Windows Exception handling model, a frontend should attach a funclet bundle; referring to an enclosing cleanuppad as follows:. .. code-block:: llvm. ehcleanup:; %tok = cleanuppad within none []; %unused = call i1 @llvm.coro.end(ptr null, i1 true, token none) [ ""funclet""(token %tok) ]; cleanupret from %tok unwind label %RestOfTheCleanup.

Simple; ------. Finally, the driver was designed to be ""as simple as possible"", given; the other goals. Notably, trying to be completely compatible with the; gcc driver adds a significant amount of complexity. However, the design; of the driver attempts to mitigate this complexity by dividing the; process into a number of independent stages instead of a single; monolithic task. Internal Design and Implementation; ==================================. .. contents::; :local:; :depth: 1. Internals Introduction; ----------------------. In order to satisfy the stated goals, the driver was designed to; completely subsume the functionality of the gcc executable; that is, the; driver should not need to delegate to gcc to perform subtasks. On; Darwin, this implies that the Clang driver also subsumes the gcc; driver-driver, which is used to implement support for building universal; images (binaries and object files). This also implies that the driver; should be able to call the language specific compilers (e.g. cc1); directly, which means that it must have enough information to forward; command line arguments to child processes correctly. Design Overview; ---------------. The diagram below shows the significant components of the driver; architecture and how they relate to one another. The orange components; represent concrete data structures built by the driver, the green; components indicate conceptually distinct stages which manipulate these; data structures, and the blue components are important helper classes. .. image:: DriverArchitecture.png; :align: center; :alt: Driver Architecture Diagram.

Performance,"eam; the variable's value changes.; * Operands can be constants, indicating the variable is assigned a; constant value. Care must be taken to update ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsics when optimization; passes alter or move instructions and blocks -- the developer could observe such; changes reflected in the value of variables when debugging the program. For any; execution of the optimized program, the set of variable values presented to the; developer by the debugger should not show a state that would never have existed; in the execution of the unoptimized program, given the same input. Doing so; risks misleading the developer by reporting a state that does not exist,; damaging their understanding of the optimized program and undermining their; trust in the debugger. Sometimes perfectly preserving variable locations is not possible, often when a; redundant calculation is optimized out. In such cases, a ``llvm.dbg.value``; with operand ``poison`` should be used, to terminate earlier variable locations; and let the debugger present ``optimized out`` to the developer. Withholding; these potentially stale variable values from the developer diminishes the; amount of available debug information, but increases the reliability of the; remaining information.

Performance,"eate miscompiles if mixing of constrained and normal; operations is done. The correct way to mix constrained and less constrained; operations is to use the rounding mode and exception handling metadata to; mark constrained intrinsics as having LLVM's default behavior. Each of these intrinsics corresponds to a normal floating-point operation. The; data arguments and the return value are the same as the corresponding FP; operation. The rounding mode argument is a metadata string specifying what; assumptions, if any, the optimizer can make when transforming constant; values. Some constrained FP intrinsics omit this argument. If required; by the intrinsic, this argument must be one of the following strings:. ::. ""round.dynamic""; ""round.tonearest""; ""round.downward""; ""round.upward""; ""round.towardzero""; ""round.tonearestaway"". If this argument is ""round.dynamic"" optimization passes must assume that the; rounding mode is unknown and may change at runtime. No transformations that; depend on rounding mode may be performed in this case. The other possible values for the rounding mode argument correspond to the; similarly named IEEE rounding modes. If the argument is any of these values; optimization passes may perform transformations as long as they are consistent; with the specified rounding mode. For example, 'x-0'->'x' is not a valid transformation if the rounding mode is; ""round.downward"" or ""round.dynamic"" because if the value of 'x' is +0 then; 'x-0' should evaluate to '-0' when rounding downward. However, this; transformation is legal for all other rounding modes. For values other than ""round.dynamic"" optimization passes may assume that the; actual runtime rounding mode (as defined in a target-specific manner) matches; the specified rounding mode, but this is not guaranteed. Using a specific; non-dynamic rounding mode which does not match the actual rounding mode at; runtime results in undefined behavior.

Clang provides a mechanism for selectively disabling optimizations in functions; and methods. To disable optimizations in a single function definition, the GNU-style or C++11; non-standard attribute ``optnone`` can be used. .. code-block:: c++. // The following functions will not be optimized.; // GNU-style attribute; __attribute__((optnone)) int foo() {; // ... code; }; // C++11 attribute; [[clang::optnone]] int bar() {; // ... code; }. To facilitate disabling optimization for a range of function definitions, a; range-based pragma is provided. Its syntax is ``#pragma clang optimize``; followed by ``off`` or ``on``. All function definitions in the region between an ``off`` and the following; ``on`` will be decorated with the ``optnone`` attribute unless doing so would; conflict with explicit attributes already present on the function (e.g. the; ones that control inlining). .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang optimize off; // This function will be decorated with optnone.; int foo() {; // ... code; }. // optnone conflicts with always_inline, so bar() will not be decorated.; __attribute__((always_inline)) int bar() {; // ... code; }; #pragma clang optimize on. If no ``on`` is found to close an ``off`` region, the end of the region is the; end of the compilation unit. Note that a stray ``#pragma clang optimize on`` does not selectively enable; additional optimizations when compiling at low optimization levels. This feature; can only be used to selectively disable optimizations",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst:159022,optimiz,optimization,159022,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

The first key to making this feasible is to recognize that many operations on; x86 are ""data-invariant"". That is, they have no (known) observable behavior; differences due to the particular input data. These instructions are often used; when implementing cryptographic primitives dealing with private key data; because they are not believed to provide any side-channels. Similarly, we can; defer hardening until after them as they will not in-and-of-themselves; introduce a speculative execution side-channel. This results in code sequences; that look like:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate without leaking.; orl %eax, %edi; ```. While an addition happens to the loaded (potentially secret) value, that; doesn't leak any data and we then immediately harden it. ###### Hardening of loaded values deferred down the data-invariant expression graph. We can generalize the previous idea and sink the hardening down the expression; graph across as many data-invariant operations as desirable. This can use very; conservative rules for whether something is data-invariant. The primary goal; should be to handle multiple loads with a single hardening instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate without leaking.; addl 4(%rsi), %edi # Continue without leaking.; addl 8(%rsi), %edi; orl %eax, %edi # Mask out bits from all three loads.; ```. ###### Preserving the flags while hardening loaded values on Haswell, Zen, and newer processors.

Using it will corrupt; and may as well crash the program!. It is time to look at the destruction of objects. A destructor is a; special C++ function that releases resources for (or destroys) an; object of a class. It is the opposite of a constructor that creates the; object of a class when it is called. The compiler will provide a; destructor that does nothing if none is provided. We will add one to; our Quad class so that we can see when it is called. The class names; the destructor but with a prefix \~ which is the C++ one's complement; i.e. bit wise complement, and hence has destruction overtones! We; declare it in the .h file and define it in the `.cxx` file. It does; not do much except print out that it has been called (still a useful; debug technique despite today's powerful debuggers!). Now run root, load the Quad class and create a heap object:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L Quad.cxx; root[] Quad *my_objptr = new Quad(1.,2.,-3.);; ```. To delete the object:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] delete my_objptr;; root[] my_objptr = 0;; ```. You should see the print out from its destructor. Setting the pointer; to zero afterwards is not strictly necessary (and Cling does it; automatically), but the object is no more accessible, and any attempt; to use the pointer again will, as has already been stated, cause; grief. So much for heap objects, but how are stack objects deleted? In; C++, a stack object is deleted as soon as control leaves the innermost; compound statement that encloses it. Therefore, it is singularly; futile to do something like:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] { Quad my_object(1.,2.,-3.); }; ```. Cling does not follow this rule; if you type in the above line, you; will not see the destructor message.

For example, consider the following LLVM fragment:. .. code-block:: llvm. %t1 = fadd float %W, %X; %t2 = fmul float %t1, %Y; %t3 = fadd float %t2, %Z. This LLVM code corresponds to a SelectionDAG that looks basically like this:. .. code-block:: text. (fadd:f32 (fmul:f32 (fadd:f32 W, X), Y), Z). If a target supports floating point multiply-and-add (FMA) operations, one of; the adds can be merged with the multiply. On the PowerPC, for example, the; output of the instruction selector might look like this DAG:. ::. (FMADDS (FADDS W, X), Y, Z). The ``FMADDS`` instruction is a ternary instruction that multiplies its first; two operands and adds the third (as single-precision floating-point numbers).; The ``FADDS`` instruction is a simple binary single-precision add instruction.; To perform this pattern match, the PowerPC backend includes the following; instruction definitions:. .. code-block:: text; :emphasize-lines: 4-5,9. def FMADDS : AForm_1<59, 29,; (ops F4RC:$FRT, F4RC:$FRA, F4RC:$FRC, F4RC:$FRB),; ""fmadds $FRT, $FRA, $FRC, $FRB"",; [(set F4RC:$FRT, (fadd (fmul F4RC:$FRA, F4RC:$FRC),; F4RC:$FRB))]>;; def FADDS : AForm_2<59, 21,; (ops F4RC:$FRT, F4RC:$FRA, F4RC:$FRB),; ""fadds $FRT, $FRA, $FRB"",; [(set F4RC:$FRT, (fadd F4RC:$FRA, F4RC:$FRB))]>;.

It is based on the text of the existing DWARF Version 5 standard. DWARF expressions describe how to compute a value or specify a location. *The evaluation of a DWARF expression can provide the location of an object, the; value of an array bound, the length of a dynamic string, the desired value; itself, and so on.*.

When a; DWARF expression is evaluated, it may be specified whether a value or location; description is required as the result kind. If a result kind is specified, and the result of the evaluation does not match; the specified result kind, then the implicit conversions described in; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-memory-location-description-operations` are performed if; valid.

This method; takes a vector of ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects, since it is common to deallocate; multiple objects at the same time and this allows us to batch these requests for; transmission to the executing process. JITLink provides a simple in-process implementation of this interface:; ``InProcessMemoryManager``. It allocates pages once and re-uses them as both; working and target memory. ORC provides a cross-process-capable ``MapperJITLinkMemoryManager`` that can use; shared memory or ORC-RPC-based communication to transfer content to the executing; process.

JITLink's ability to link JIT'd code for a separate executor process can be; used to improve the security of a JIT system: The executor process can be; sandboxed, run within a VM, or even run on a fully separate machine. JITLink's memory manager interface is flexible enough to allow for a range of; trade-offs between performance and security. For example, on a system where code; pages must be signed (preventing code from being updated), the memory manager; can deallocate working memory pages after linking to free memory in the process; running JITLink. Alternatively, on a system that allows RWX pages, the memory; manager may use the same pages for both working and target memory by marking; them as RWX, allowing code to be modified in place without further overhead.; Finally, if RWX pages are not permitted but dual-virtual-mappings of; physical memory pages are, then the memory manager can dual map physical pages; as RW- in the JITLink process and R-X in the executor process, allowing; modification from the JITLink process but not from the executor (at the cost of; extra administrative overhead for the dual mapping).

While in some cases static; analysis is effective at doing this at scale, in many cases it still relies on; human judgement to evaluate whether code might be vulnerable. Especially for; software systems which receive less detailed scrutiny but remain sensitive to; these attacks, this seems like an impractical security model. We need an; automatic and systematic mitigation strategy. ### Automatic `lfence` on Conditional Edges. A natural way to scale up the existing hand-coded mitigations is simply to; inject an `lfence` instruction into both the target and fallthrough; destinations of every conditional branch. This ensures that no predicate or; bounds check can be bypassed speculatively. However, the performance overhead; of this approach is, simply put, catastrophic.

The ``ImplicitNullChecks`` pass transforms explicit control flow for; checking if a pointer is ``null``, like:. .. code-block:: llvm. %ptr = call i32* @get_ptr(); %ptr_is_null = icmp i32* %ptr, null; br i1 %ptr_is_null, label %is_null, label %not_null, !make.implicit !0. not_null:; %t = load i32, i32* %ptr; br label %do_something_with_t. is_null:; call void @HFC(); unreachable. !0 = !{}. to control flow implicit in the instruction loading or storing through; the pointer being null checked:. .. code-block:: llvm. %ptr = call i32* @get_ptr(); %t = load i32, i32* %ptr ;; handler-pc = label %is_null; br label %do_something_with_t. is_null:; call void @HFC(); unreachable. This transform happens at the ``MachineInstr`` level, not the LLVM IR; level (so the above example is only representative, not literal). The; ``ImplicitNullChecks`` pass runs during codegen, if; ``-enable-implicit-null-checks`` is passed to ``llc``. The ``ImplicitNullChecks`` pass adds entries to the; ``__llvm_faultmaps`` section described above as needed. ``make.implicit`` metadata; --------------------------. Making null checks implicit is an aggressive optimization, and it can; be a net performance pessimization if too many memory operations end; up faulting because of it.

Performance,"ed code from misspeculation in; an unmitigated caller. There is also an advantage to using this form of interprocedural mitigation: by; forming these invalid stack pointer addresses we can prevent speculative; returns from successfully reading speculatively written values to the actual; stack. This works first by forming a data-dependency between computing the; address of the return address on the stack and our predicate state. And even; when satisfied, if a misprediction causes the state to be poisoned the; resulting stack pointer will be invalid. ##### Rewrite API of internal functions to directly propagate predicate state. (Not yet implemented.). We have the option with internal functions to directly adjust their API to; accept the predicate as an argument and return it. This is likely to be; marginally cheaper than embedding into `%rsp` for entering functions. ##### Use `lfence` to guard function transitions. An `lfence` instruction can be used to prevent subsequent loads from; speculatively executing until all prior mispredicted predicates have resolved.; We can use this broader barrier to speculative loads executing between; functions. We emit it in the entry block to handle calls, and prior to each; return. This approach also has the advantage of providing the strongest degree; of mitigation when mixed with unmitigated code by halting all misspeculation; entering a function which is mitigated, regardless of what occurred in the; caller. However, such a mixture is inherently more risky. Whether this kind of; mixture is a sufficient mitigation requires careful analysis. Unfortunately, experimental results indicate that the performance overhead of; this approach is very high for certain patterns of code. A classic example is; any form of recursive evaluation engine. The hot, rapid call and return; sequences exhibit dramatic performance loss when mitigated with `lfence`. This; component alone can regress performance by 2x or more, making it an unpleasant; tradeoff",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:41333,load,loads,41333,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['loads']

At that point, they; get removed from the queue and the retire control unit is notified. When instructions are executed, the retire control unit flags the instruction as; ""ready to retire."". Instructions are retired in program order. The register file is notified of the; retirement so that it can free the physical registers that were allocated for; the instruction during the register renaming stage. Load/Store Unit and Memory Consistency Model; """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; To simulate an out-of-order execution of memory operations, :program:`llvm-mca`; utilizes a simulated load/store unit (LSUnit) to simulate the speculative; execution of loads and stores. Each load (or store) consumes an entry in the load (or store) queue. Users can; specify flags ``-lqueue`` and ``-squeue`` to limit the number of entries in the; load and store queues respectively. The queues are unbounded by default. The LSUnit implements a relaxed consistency model for memory loads and stores.; The rules are:. 1. A younger load is allowed to pass an older load only if there are no; intervening stores or barriers between the two loads.; 2. A younger load is allowed to pass an older store provided that the load does; not alias with the store.; 3. A younger store is not allowed to pass an older store.; 4. A younger store is not allowed to pass an older load. By default, the LSUnit optimistically assumes that loads do not alias; (`-noalias=true`) store operations. Under this assumption, younger loads are; always allowed to pass older stores. Essentially, the LSUnit does not attempt; to run any alias analysis to predict when loads and stores do not alias with; each other. Note that, in the case of write-combining memory, rule 3 could be relaxed to; allow reordering of non-aliasing store operations. That being said, at the; moment, there is no way to further relax the memory model (``",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-mca.rst:39665,queue,queues,39665,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-mca.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-mca.rst,1,['queue'],['queues']

This means that the register content is the same as it would have been on a little endian system. It may seem that ``LD1`` should suffice to perform vector loads on a big endian machine. However there are pros and cons to the two approaches that make it less than simple which register format to pick. There are two options:. 1.

The content of a vector register is the same *as if* it had been loaded with an ``LD1`` instruction.

LLVM IR has first class vector types. In LLVM IR, the zero'th element of a vector resides at the lowest memory address. The optimizer relies on this property in certain areas, for example when concatenating vectors together.

To allow better optimization of C/C++ math library functions,; use ""-fno-math-errno"".

For; example, the loop below will be vectorized on Intel x86 if the SSE4.1 roundps; instruction is available. .. code-block:: c++. void foo(float *f) {; for (int i = 0; i != 1024; ++i); f[i] = floorf(f[i]);; }.

It's worth noting that, for historical reasons, this library is; called ``libLLVMCore.so``, not ``libLLVMIR.so`` as you might expect. .. _Type:. The Type class and Derived Types; --------------------------------. ``Type`` is a superclass of all type classes. Every ``Value`` has a ``Type``.; ``Type`` cannot be instantiated directly but only through its subclasses.; Certain primitive types (``VoidType``, ``LabelType``, ``FloatType`` and; ``DoubleType``) have hidden subclasses. They are hidden because they offer no; useful functionality beyond what the ``Type`` class offers except to distinguish; themselves from other subclasses of ``Type``. All other types are subclasses of ``DerivedType``. Types can be named, but this; is not a requirement. There exists exactly one instance of a given shape at any; one time. This allows type equality to be performed with address equality of; the Type Instance. That is, given two ``Type*`` values, the types are identical; if the pointers are identical. .. _m_Type:. Important Public Methods; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. * ``bool isIntegerTy() const``: Returns true for any integer type. * ``bool isFloatingPointTy()``: Return true if this is one of the five; floating point types. * ``bool isSized()``: Return true if the type has known size. Things; that don't have a size are abstract types, labels and void. .. _derivedtypes:. Important Derived Types; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``IntegerType``; Subclass of DerivedType that represents integer types of any bit width. Any; bit width between ``IntegerType::MIN_INT_BITS`` (1) and; ``IntegerType::MAX_INT_BITS`` (~8 million) can be represented. * ``static const IntegerType* get(unsigned NumBits)``: get an integer; type of a specific bit width. * ``unsigned getBitWidth() const``: Get the bit width of an integer type. ``SequentialType``; This is subclassed by ArrayTy",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:135224,perform,performed,135224,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['perform'],['performed']

Sadly, there are no useful instructions on x86 that apply a mask to all 64 bits; without touching the flag registers. However, we can harden loaded values that; are narrower than a word (fewer than 32-bits on 32-bit systems and fewer than; 64-bits on 64-bit systems) by zero-extending the value to the full word size; and then shifting right by at least the number of original bits using the BMI2; `shrx` instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate 32 bits of data.; shrxq %rax, %rdi, %rdi # Shift out all 32 bits loaded.; ```. Because on x86 the zero-extend is free, this can efficiently harden the loaded; value. ##### Hardening the address of the load. When hardening the loaded value is inapplicable, most often because the; instruction directly leaks information (like `cmp` or `jmpq`), we switch to; hardening the _address_ of the load instead of the loaded value. This avoids; increasing register pressure by unfolding the load or paying some other high; cost. To understand how this works in practice, we need to examine the exact; semantics of the x86 addressing modes which, in its fully general form, looks; like `(%base,%index,scale)offset`. Here `%base` and `%index` are 64-bit; registers that can potentially be any value, and may be attacker controlled,; and `scale` and `offset` are fixed immediate values. `scale` must be `1`, `2`,; `4`, or `8`, and `offset` can be any 32-bit sign extended value. The exact; computation performed to find the address is then: `%base + (scale * %index) +; offset` under 64-bit 2's complement modular arithmetic. One issue with this approach is that, after hardening, the `%base + (scal",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:27526,load,load,27526,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['load']

The default compression algorithm used when writing ROOT files has been updated to use LZ4 in particular to improve read (decompression) performance. You can change this default for each file through (for example) the `TFile constructor` or `TFile::SetCompressionAlgorithm`. It should be noted that ROOT files written with LZ4 compression can not be read with older release of ROOT. Support for LZ4 was however back-ported to the patch branches of previous releases and the following tags (and later release in the same patch series) can read ROOT files written with LZ4 compression:. * v5.34/38; * v6.08/06 [not yet released]; * v6.10/08; * v6.12/02. ## Removed interfaces. ## Core Libraries; - Optimize away redundant deserialization of template specializations.

The advertised premise of Numba is that it ""makes Python code fast.""; However, there is a much more compelling reason: Numba allows developers to; stay in their chosen ecosystem, be it Python or C++, in mixed environments,; without paying for their choice in lost performance.; For example, a Python developer using Numba does not need to rewrite a kernel; into C++ just to run performantly in a C++ framework.; Similarly, a C++ developer can use Numba to compile and create function; pointers to Python code for easy, performant, access.; This becomes even more compelling if the deployment target is a GPU, which; would otherwise certainly require a rewrite of the Python code.; Add that Numba, as a JIT-compiler, is fully run-time just like ``cppyy``,; and the use case for integration is clear.; (Numba does not currently provide support for C++.). Usage; -------. ``cppyy`` does not use Numba extension hooks to minimize accidental; dependencies.; Instead, it requires that the extensions are loaded explicitly by any code; that uses it::. import cppyy.numba_ext. After that, Numba is able to trace ``cppyy`` bound code when applying the; usual ``numba.njit`` decorator. Numba type declarations are done lazily, with the ``numba_ext`` module only; initially registering hooks on proxy base classes, to keep overheads in; Numba's type-resolution to a minimum.; On use in a JITed trace, each C++ type or function call is refined to the; actual, concrete types and type-sp",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst:1900,perform,performant,1900,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,1,['perform'],['performant']

Performance,"efgroup roofit_dev_docs_batchcompute RooBatchCompute library guide; \ingroup roofit_dev_docs; \date September 2021; \author Emmanouil Michalainas; \brief Overview of the RooBatchCompute library. ## RooBatchCompute Library; _Contains optimized computation functions for PDFs that enable significantly faster fittings._; #### Note: This library is still at an experimental stage. Tests are being conducted continuously to ensure correctness of the results, but the interfaces and the instructions on how to use might change. ### Purpose; While fitting, a significant amount of time and processing power is spent on computing the probability function for every event and PDF involved in the fitting model. To speed up this process, roofit can use the computation functions provided in this library. The functions provided here process whole data arrays (batches) instead of a single event at a time, as in the legacy evaluate() function in roofit. In addition, the code is written in a manner that allows for compiler optimizations, notably auto-vectorization. This library is compiled multiple times for different [vector instruction set architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) and the optimal code is executed during runtime, as a result of an automatic hardware detection mechanism that this library contains. **As a result, fits can benefit by a speedup of 3x-16x.**. As of ROOT v6.26, RooBatchComputes also provides multithread and [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) instances of the computation functions, resulting in even greater improvements for fitting times. ### How to use; This library is an internal component of RooFit, so users are not supposed to actively interact with it. Instead, they can benefit from significantly faster times for fitting by calling `fitTo()` and providing a `BatchMode(""cpu"")` or a `BatchMode(""cuda"")` option.; ``` {.cpp}; // fit using the most efficient library that the computer's CPU can support; RooMyPDF.fitTo(data, BatchMode(""cpu""));. // f",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/batchcompute.md:1017,optimiz,optimizations,1017,roofit/doc/developers/batchcompute.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/batchcompute.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']

This semantic quirk allows the runtime to pick a; integer mapping for each point in the program allowing relocations of objects; without visible effects. This high level abstract machine model is used for most of the optimizer. As; a result, transform passes do not need to be extended to look through explicit; relocation sequence. Before starting code generation, we switch; representations to an explicit form. The exact location chosen for lowering; is an implementation detail. Note that most of the value of the abstract machine model comes for collectors; which need to model potentially relocatable objects. For a compiler which; supports only a non-relocating collector, you may wish to consider starting; with the fully explicit form. Warning: There is one currently known semantic hole in the definition of; non-integral pointers which has not been addressed upstream. To work around; this, you need to disable speculation of loads unless the memory type; (non-integral pointer vs anything else) is known to unchanged. That is, it is; not safe to speculate a load if doing causes a non-integral pointer value to; be loaded as any other type or vice versa. In practice, this restriction is; well isolated to isSafeToSpeculate in ValueTracking.cpp. Explicit Representation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A frontend could directly generate this low level explicit form, but; doing so may inhibit optimization. Instead, it is recommended that; compilers with relocating collectors target the abstract machine model just; described. The heart of the explicit approach is to construct (or rewrite) the IR in a; manner where the possible updates performed by the garbage collector are; explicitly visible in the IR.

The logging is automatically excluded during a normal build of the program,; hence it does not impact performance during a normal execution. It is advised to use such fine tuning only in a program's cold regions. The weak; symbols can introduce extra control flow (the ``if`` checks), while the macros; (hence declarations they guard in ``profile/instr_prof_interface.h``); can change the control flow of the functions that use them between profile; generation and profile use (which can lead to discarded counters in such; functions).

In certain situations, it may be useful to disable profile generation or use; for specific files in a build, without affecting the main compilation flags; used for the other files in the project.

Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.masked.store``' intrinsics is designed for conditional writing of selected vector elements in a single IR operation. It is useful for targets that support vector masked store and allows vectorizing predicated basic blocks on these targets. Other targets may support this intrinsic differently, for example by lowering it into a sequence of branches that guard scalar store operations.; The result of this operation is equivalent to a load-modify-store sequence. However, using this intrinsic prevents exceptions and data races on memory access to masked-off lanes. ::. call void @llvm.masked.store.v16f32.p0(<16 x float> %value, ptr %ptr, i32 4, <16 x i1> %mask). ;; The result of the following instructions is identical aside from potential data races and memory access exceptions; %oldval = load <16 x float>, ptr %ptr, align 4; %res = select <16 x i1> %mask, <16 x float> %value, <16 x float> %oldval; store <16 x float> %res, ptr %ptr, align 4. Masked Vector Gather and Scatter Intrinsics; -------------------------------------------. LLVM provides intrinsics for vector gather and scatter operations. They are similar to :ref:`Masked Vector Load and Store <int_mload_mstore>`, except they are designed for arbitrary memory accesses, rather than sequential memory accesses. Gather and scatter also employ a mask operand, which holds one bit per vector element, switching the associated vector lane on or off. The memory addresses corresponding to the ""off"" lanes are not accessed. When all bits are off, no memory is accessed. .. _int_mgather:.

We turn off llvm_first_trigger() calls with NOPs, but this would hide; phase behavior from us (when some funcs/traces stop being hot and; others become hot.). We have a SIGALRM timer that counts time for us. Every time we get a; SIGALRM we look at our priority queue of locations where we have; removed llvm_first_trigger() calls. Each location is inserted along; with a time when we will next turn instrumentation back on for that; call site. If the time has arrived for a particular call site, we pop; that off the prio. queue and turn instrumentation back on for that; call site. Generating traces; -----------------.

The; optimized trace does not have instrumentation. The original code and; the instrumented code are modified to have a branch to the trace; cache, where the optimized traces are kept. We copy the code from the original to the instrumentation version; by tracing the LLVM-to-Machine code basic block map and then copying; each machine code basic block we think is in the hot region into the; trace cache. Then we instrument that code. The process is similar for; generating the final optimized trace; we copy the same basic blocks; because we might need to put in fixup code for exit BBs. LLVM basic blocks are not typically used in the Reoptimizer except; for the mapping information. We are restricted to using single instructions to branch between the; original code, trace, and instrumented code.

Shapes are named objects and register themselves to the `manager class`; at creation time. This is responsible for their final deletion. Shapes; can be created without name if their retrieval by name is no needed.; Generally shapes are objects that are useful only at geometry creation; stage. The pointer to a shape is in fact needed only when referring to a; given volume and it is always accessible at that level. Several volumes; may reference a single shape; therefore its deletion is not possible; once volumes were defined based on it. The navigation features related for instance to tracking particles are; performed in the following way: Each shape implement its specific; algorithms for all required tasks in its local reference system. Note; that the manager class handles global queries related to geometry.; However, shape-related queries might be sometimes useful:. ~~~ {.cpp}; Bool_t TGeoShape::Contains(Double_t *point[3]);; ~~~. The method above returns `kTRUE` if the point \*point is actually inside; the shape. The point has to be defined in the local shape reference. For; instance, for a box having `DX,DY` and `DZ `half-lengths a point will be; considered inside if:. `-DX <= point[0] <= DX`. `-DY <= point[1] <= DY`. `-DZ <= point[2] <= DZ`. ~~~ {.cpp}; Double_t TGeoShape::DistFromInside(Double_t *point[3],; Double_t *dir[3], Int_t iact,Double_t step,Double_t *safe);; ~~~.

Definitions consistency; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The C++ language defines that same declarations in different translation units should have; the same definition, as known as ODR (One Definition Rule). Prior to modules, the translation; units don't dependent on each other and the compiler itself can't perform a strong; ODR violation check. With the introduction of modules, now the compiler have; the chance to perform ODR violations with language semantics across translation units. However, in the practice, we found the existing ODR checking mechanism is not stable; enough. Many people suffers from the false positive ODR violation diagnostics, AKA,; the compiler are complaining two identical declarations have different definitions; incorrectly. Also the true positive ODR violations are rarely reported.; Also we learned that MSVC don't perform ODR check for declarations in the global module; fragment. So in order to get better user experience, save the time checking ODR and keep consistent; behavior with MSVC, we disabled the ODR check for the declarations in the global module; fragment by default.

You can read more in the; :ref:`loop terminology section for the LCSSA form <loop-terminology-lcssa>`. .. _passes-licm:. ``licm``: Loop Invariant Code Motion; ------------------------------------. This pass performs loop invariant code motion, attempting to remove as much; code from the body of a loop as possible. It does this by either hoisting code; into the preheader block, or by sinking code to the exit blocks if it is safe.; This pass also promotes must-aliased memory locations in the loop to live in; registers, thus hoisting and sinking ""invariant"" loads and stores. Hoisting operations out of loops is a canonicalization transform. It enables; and simplifies subsequent optimizations in the middle-end. Rematerialization; of hoisted instructions to reduce register pressure is the responsibility of; the back-end, which has more accurate information about register pressure and; also handles other optimizations than LICM that increase live-ranges. This pass uses alias analysis for two purposes:. #. Moving loop invariant loads and calls out of loops. If we can determine; that a load or call inside of a loop never aliases anything stored to, we; can hoist it or sink it like any other instruction. #. Scalar Promotion of Memory. If there is a store instruction inside of the; loop, we try to move the store to happen AFTER the loop instead of inside of; the loop. This can only happen if a few conditions are true:. #. The pointer stored through is loop invariant.; #. There are no stores or loads in the loop which *may* alias the pointer.; There are no calls in the loop which mod/ref the pointer. If these conditions are true, we can promote the loads and stores in the; loop of the pointer to use a temporary alloca'd variable.

As a result of these restrictions not all language features supported by LLVM; worked under MCJIT, and objects to be loaded under the JIT had to be compiled to; target it (precluding the use of precompiled code from other sources under the; JIT). RuntimeDyld also provided very limited visibility into the linking process; itself: Clients could access conservative estimates of section size; (RuntimeDyld bundled stub size and padding estimates into the section size; value) and the final relocated bytes, but could not access RuntimeDyld's; internal object representations. Eliminating these restrictions and limitations was one of the primary motivations; for the development of JITLink. The llvm-jitlink tool; =====================. The ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is a command line wrapper for the JITLink library.; It loads some set of relocatable object files and then links them using; JITLink. Depending on the options used it will then execute them, or validate; the linked memory. The ``llvm-jitlink`` tool was originally designed to aid JITLink development by; providing a simple environment for testing. Basic usage; -----------. By default, ``llvm-jitlink`` will link the set of objects passed on the command; line, then search for a ""main"" function and execute it:. .. code-block:: sh. % cat hello-world.c; #include <stdio.h>. int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {; printf(""hello, world!\n"");; return 0;; }. % clang -c -o hello-world.o hello-world.c; % llvm-jitlink hello-world.o; Hello, World!.

Non-Goals; ---------. ``MemorySSA`` is meant to reason about the relation between memory; operations, and enable quicker querying.; It isn't meant to be the single source of truth for all potential memory-related; optimizations. Specifically, care must be taken when trying to use ``MemorySSA``; to reason about atomic or volatile operations, as in:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8 @foo(ptr %a) {; entry:; br i1 undef, label %if.then, label %if.end. if.then:; ; 1 = MemoryDef(liveOnEntry); %0 = load volatile i8, ptr %a; br label %if.end. if.end:; %av = phi i8 [0, %entry], [%0, %if.then]; ret i8 %av; }.

Precision; ^^^^^^^^^. ``MemorySSA`` in LLVM deliberately trades off precision for speed.; Let us think about memory variables as if they were disjoint partitions of the; memory (that is, if you have one variable, as above, it represents the entire; memory, and if you have multiple variables, each one represents some; disjoint portion of the memory). First, because alias analysis results conflict with each other, and; each result may be what an analysis wants (IE; TBAA may say no-alias, and something else may say must-alias), it is; not possible to partition the memory the way every optimization wants.; Second, some alias analysis results are not transitive (IE A noalias B,; and B noalias C, does not mean A noalias C), so it is not possible to; come up with a precise partitioning in all cases without variables to; represent every pair of possible aliases.

You should describe a concrete target-specific class that represents the; register file of a target machine. This class is called ``XXXRegisterInfo``; (where ``XXX`` identifies the target) and represents the class register file; data that is used for register allocation. It also describes the interactions; between registers. You also need to define register classes to categorize related registers. A; register class should be added for groups of registers that are all treated the; same way for some instruction. Typical examples are register classes for; integer, floating-point, or vector registers. A register allocator allows an; instruction to use any register in a specified register class to perform the; instruction in a similar manner. Register classes allocate virtual registers; to instructions from these sets, and register classes let the; target-independent register allocator automatically choose the actual; registers. Much of the code for registers, including register definition, register; aliases, and register classes, is generated by TableGen from; ``XXXRegisterInfo.td`` input files and placed in ``XXXGenRegisterInfo.h.inc``; and ``XXXGenRegisterInfo.inc`` output files.

Performance,"ementing methods follow the signature of the static type.; It is undefined behavior if ARC is exposed to an invalid pointer. For ARC's purposes, a valid object is one with ""well-behaved"" retaining; operations. Specifically, the object must be laid out such that the; Objective-C message send machinery can successfully send it the following; messages:. * ``retain``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object.; * ``release``, taking no arguments and returning ``void``.; * ``autorelease``, taking no arguments and returning a pointer to the object. The behavior of these methods is constrained in the following ways. The term; :arc-term:`high-level semantics` is an intentionally vague term; the intent is; that programmers must implement these methods in a way such that the compiler,; modifying code in ways it deems safe according to these constraints, will not; violate their requirements. For example, if the user puts logging statements; in ``retain``, they should not be surprised if those statements are executed; more or less often depending on optimization settings. These constraints are; not exhaustive of the optimization opportunities: values held in local; variables are subject to additional restrictions, described later in this; document. It is undefined behavior if a computation history featuring a send of; ``retain`` followed by a send of ``release`` to the same object, with no; intervening ``release`` on that object, is not equivalent under the high-level; semantics to a computation history in which these sends are removed. Note that; this implies that these methods may not raise exceptions. It is undefined behavior if a computation history features any use whatsoever; of an object following the completion of a send of ``release`` that is not; preceded by a send of ``retain`` to the same object.

On ARM (before v8), MIPS, and many other RISC architectures, Acquire, Release,; and SequentiallyConsistent semantics require barrier instructions for every such; operation.

It is often easiest for backends to use AtomicExpandPass to lower some of the; atomic constructs. Here are some lowerings it can do:. * cmpxchg -> loop with load-linked/store-conditional; by overriding ``shouldExpandAtomicCmpXchgInIR()``, ``emitLoadLinked()``,; ``emitStoreConditional()``; * large loads/stores -> ll-sc/cmpxchg; by overriding ``shouldExpandAtomicStoreInIR()``/``shouldExpandAtomicLoadInIR()``; * strong atomic accesses -> monotonic accesses + fences by overriding; ``shouldInsertFencesForAtomic()``, ``emitLeadingFence()``, and; ``emitTrailingFence()``; * atomic rmw -> loop with cmpxchg or load-linked/store-conditional; by overriding ``expandAtomicRMWInIR()``; * expansion to __atomic_* libcalls for unsupported sizes.; * part-word atomicrmw/cmpxchg -> target-specific intrinsic by overriding; ``shouldExpandAtomicRMWInIR``, ``emitMaskedAtomicRMWIntrinsic``,; ``shouldExpandAtomicCmpXchgInIR``, and ``emitMaskedAtomicCmpXchgIntrinsic``.

Performance,"enerating the PCH file initially is not so large that it; counters the per-source-file performance improvement due to eliminating the; need to parse the bundled headers in the first place. This is particularly; important on multi-core systems, because PCH file generation serializes the; build when all compilations require the PCH file to be up-to-date. Modules, as implemented in Clang, use the same mechanisms as precompiled; headers to save a serialized AST file (one per module) and use those AST; modules. From an implementation standpoint, modules are a generalization of; precompiled headers, lifting a number of restrictions placed on precompiled; headers. In particular, there can only be one precompiled header and it must; be included at the beginning of the translation unit. The extensions to the; AST file format required for modules are discussed in the section on; :ref:`modules <pchinternals-modules>`. Clang's AST files are designed with a compact on-disk representation, which; minimizes both creation time and the time required to initially load the AST; file. The AST file itself contains a serialized representation of Clang's; abstract syntax trees and supporting data structures, stored using the same; compressed bitstream as `LLVM's bitcode file format; <https://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html>`_. Clang's AST files are loaded ""lazily"" from disk. When an AST file is initially; loaded, Clang reads only a small amount of data from the AST file to establish; where certain important data structures are stored.

Performance,"enseMap that you should be aware of, however.; The iterators in a DenseMap are invalidated whenever an insertion occurs,; unlike map. Also, because DenseMap allocates space for a large number of; key/value pairs (it starts with 64 by default), it will waste a lot of space if; your keys or values are large. Finally, you must implement a partial; specialization of DenseMapInfo for the key that you want, if it isn't already; supported. This is required to tell DenseMap about two special marker values; (which can never be inserted into the map) that it needs internally. DenseMap's find_as() method supports lookup operations using an alternate key; type. This is useful in cases where the normal key type is expensive to; construct, but cheap to compare against. The DenseMapInfo is responsible for; defining the appropriate comparison and hashing methods for each alternate key; type used.

Performance,"ent expression. .. _pchinternals-ident-table:. Identifier Table Block; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The identifier table block contains an on-disk hash table that maps each; identifier mentioned within the AST file to the serialized representation of; the identifier's information (e.g, the ``IdentifierInfo`` structure). The; serialized representation contains:. * The actual identifier string.; * Flags that describe whether this identifier is the name of a built-in, a; poisoned identifier, an extension token, or a macro.; * If the identifier names a macro, the offset of the macro definition within; the :ref:`pchinternals-preprocessor`.; * If the identifier names one or more declarations visible from translation; unit scope, the :ref:`declaration IDs <pchinternals-decls>` of these; declarations. When an AST file is loaded, the AST file reader mechanism introduces itself; into the identifier table as an external lookup source. Thus, when the user; program refers to an identifier that has not yet been seen, Clang will perform; a lookup into the identifier table. If an identifier is found, its contents; (macro definitions, flags, top-level declarations, etc.) will be deserialized,; at which point the corresponding ``IdentifierInfo`` structure will have the; same contents it would have after parsing the headers in the AST file. Within the AST file, the identifiers used to name declarations are represented; with an integral value. A separate table provides a mapping from this integral; value (the identifier ID) to the location within the on-disk hash table where; that identifier is stored. This mapping is used when deserializing the name of; a declaration, the identifier of a token, or any other construct in the AST; file that refers to a name. .. _pchinternals-method-pool:.

Performance,"ent import requests.; This is the ``ASTImporterLookupTable`` class. This lookup table should be; shared amongst the different ``ASTImporter`` instances if they happen to import; to the very same ""to"" context. This is why we can use the importer specific; lookup only via the ``ASTImporterSharedState`` class. ExternalASTSource; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The ``ExternalASTSource`` is an abstract interface associated with the; ``ASTContext`` class. It provides the ability to read the declarations stored; within a declaration context either for iteration or for name lookup. A; declaration context with an external AST source may load its declarations; on-demand. This means that the list of declarations (represented as a linked; list, the head is ``DeclContext::FirstDecl``) could be empty. However, member; functions like ``DeclContext::lookup()`` may initiate a load. Usually, external sources are associated with precompiled headers. For example,; when we load a class from a PCH then the members are loaded only if we do want; to look up something in the class' context. In case of LLDB, an implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is; attached to the AST context which is related to the parsed expression. This; implementation of the ``ExternalASTSource`` interface is realized with the help; of the ``ASTImporter`` class. This way, LLDB can reuse Clang's parsing; machinery while synthesizing the underlying AST from the debug data (e.g. from; DWARF). From the view of the ``ASTImporter`` this means both the ""to"" and the; ""from"" context may have declaration contexts with external lexical storage. If; a ``DeclContext`` in the ""to"" AST context has external lexical storage then we; must take extra attention to work only with the already loaded declarations!; Otherwise, we would end up with an uncontrolled import process.

If a ``PassBuilder`` has a corresponding ``TargetMachine`` for a backend, it; will call ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` to allow the; backend to inject passes into the pipeline. Clang's ``BackendUtil.cpp`` shows examples of a frontend adding (mostly; sanitizer) passes to various parts of the pipeline.; ``AMDGPUTargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` is an example of a; backend adding passes to various parts of the pipeline. Pass plugins can also add passes into default pipelines. Different tools have; different ways of loading dynamic pass plugins.

Using Analyses; ==============. LLVM provides many analyses that passes can use, such as a dominator tree.; Calculating these can be expensive, so the new pass manager has; infrastructure to cache analyses and reuse them when possible. When a pass runs on some IR, it also receives an analysis manager which it can; query for analyses. Querying for an analysis will cause the manager to check if; it has already computed the result for the requested IR. If it already has and; the result is still valid, it will return that. Otherwise it will construct a; new result by calling the analysis's ``run()`` method, cache it, and return it.; You can also ask the analysis manager to only return an analysis if it's; already cached. The analysis manager only provides analysis results for the same IR type as; what the pass runs on. For example, a function pass receives an analysis; manager that only provides function-level analyses. This works for many; passes which work on a fixed scope. However, some passes want to peek up or; down the IR hierarchy. For example, an SCC pass may want to look at function; analyses for the functions inside the SCC. Or it may want to look",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst:6958,cache,cache,6958,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,1,['cache'],['cache']

Here; is a testcase:. ::. extern foo(a); # ok, defines foo.; def foo(b) b; # Error: Unknown variable name. (decl using 'a' takes precedence). Driver Changes and Closing Thoughts; ===================================. For now, code generation to LLVM doesn't really get us much, except that; we can look at the pretty IR calls. The sample code inserts calls to; codegen into the ""``HandleDefinition``"", ""``HandleExtern``"" etc; functions, and then dumps out the LLVM IR. This gives a nice way to look; at the LLVM IR for simple functions. For example:. ::. ready> 4+5;; Read top-level expression:; define double @0() {; entry:; ret double 9.000000e+00; }. Note how the parser turns the top-level expression into anonymous; functions for us. This will be handy when we add `JIT; support <LangImpl04.html#adding-a-jit-compiler>`_ in the next chapter. Also note that the; code is very literally transcribed, no optimizations are being performed; except simple constant folding done by IRBuilder. We will `add; optimizations <LangImpl04.html#trivial-constant-folding>`_ explicitly in the next; chapter. ::. ready> def foo(a b) a*a + 2*a*b + b*b;; Read function definition:; define double @foo(double %a, double %b) {; entry:; %multmp = fmul double %a, %a; %multmp1 = fmul double 2.000000e+00, %a; %multmp2 = fmul double %multmp1, %b; %addtmp = fadd double %multmp, %multmp2; %multmp3 = fmul double %b, %b; %addtmp4 = fadd double %addtmp, %multmp3; ret double %addtmp4; }. This shows some simple arithmetic. Notice the striking similarity to the; LLVM builder calls that we use to create the instructions. ::. ready> def bar(a) foo(a, 4.0) + bar(31337);; Read function definition:; define double @bar(double %a) {; entry:; %calltmp = call double @foo(double %a, double 4.000000e+00); %calltmp1 = call double @bar(double 3.133700e+04); %addtmp = fadd double %calltmp, %calltmp1; ret double %addtmp; }.

The LLJIT class uses an IRCompileLayer and RTDyldObjectLinkingLayer to support; compilation of LLVM IR and linking of relocatable object files. All operations; are performed eagerly on symbol lookup (i.e. a symbol's definition is compiled; as soon as you attempt to look up its address). LLJIT is a suitable replacement; for MCJIT in most cases (note: some more advanced features, e.g.; JITEventListeners are not supported yet). The LLLazyJIT extends LLJIT and adds a CompileOnDemandLayer to enable lazy; compilation of LLVM IR. When an LLVM IR module is added via the addLazyIRModule; method, function bodies in that module will not be compiled until they are first; called. LLLazyJIT aims to provide a replacement of LLVM's original (pre-MCJIT); JIT API. LLJIT and LLLazyJIT instances can be created using their respective builder; classes: LLJITBuilder and LLazyJITBuilder. For example, assuming you have a; module ``M`` loaded on a ThreadSafeContext ``Ctx``:. .. code-block:: c++. // Try to detect the host arch and construct an LLJIT instance.; auto JIT = LLJITBuilder().create();. // If we could not construct an instance, return an error.; if (!JIT); return JIT.takeError();. // Add the module.; if (auto Err = JIT->addIRModule(TheadSafeModule(std::move(M), Ctx))); return Err;. // Look up the JIT'd code entry point.; auto EntrySym = JIT->lookup(""entry"");; if (!EntrySym); return EntrySym.takeError();. // Cast the entry point address to a function pointer.; auto *Entry = EntrySym.getAddress().toPtr<void(*)()>();. // Call into JIT'd code.; Entry();. The builder classes provide a number of configuration options that can be; specified before the JIT instance is constructed.

Interested readers may read that chapter for details, but; in short: to optimize a Module we create an llvm::FunctionPassManager; instance, configure it with a set of optimizations, then run the PassManager on; a Module to mutate it into a (hopefully) more optimized but semantically; equivalent form. In the original tutorial series the FunctionPassManager was; created outside the KaleidoscopeJIT and modules were optimized before being; added to it. In this Chapter we will make optimization a phase of our JIT; instead. For now this will provide us a motivation to learn more about ORC; layers, but in the long term making optimization part of our JIT will yield an; important benefit: When we begin lazily compiling code (i.e. deferring; compilation of each function until the first time it's run) having; optimization managed by our JIT will allow us to optimize lazily too, rather; than having to do all our optimization up-front.

Querying for an analysis will cause the manager to check if; it has already computed the result for the requested IR. If it already has and; the result is still valid, it will return that. Otherwise it will construct a; new result by calling the analysis's ``run()`` method, cache it, and return it.; You can also ask the analysis manager to only return an analysis if it's; already cached.

Performance,"er systems, LLVM doesn't; hold to the mistaken notion that one set of optimizations is right for; all languages and for all situations. LLVM allows a compiler implementor; to make complete decisions about what optimizations to use, in which; order, and in what situation. As a concrete example, LLVM supports both ""whole module"" passes, which; look across as large of body of code as they can (often a whole file,; but if run at link time, this can be a substantial portion of the whole; program). It also supports and includes ""per-function"" passes which just; operate on a single function at a time, without looking at other; functions. For more information on passes and how they are run, see the; `How to Write a Pass <../../WritingAnLLVMPass.html>`_ document and the; `List of LLVM Passes <../../Passes.html>`_. For Kaleidoscope, we are currently generating functions on the fly, one; at a time, as the user types them in. We aren't shooting for the; ultimate optimization experience in this setting, but we also want to; catch the easy and quick stuff where possible. As such, we will choose; to run a few per-function optimizations as the user types the function; in. If we wanted to make a ""static Kaleidoscope compiler"", we would use; exactly the code we have now, except that we would defer running the; optimizer until the entire file has been parsed.

If it is necessary to map another; virtual register to the same stack slot, use; ``VirtRegMap::assignVirt2StackSlot(vreg, stack_location)``. One important point; to consider when using the indirect mapping, is that even if a virtual register; is mapped to memory, it still needs to be mapped to a physical register. This; physical register is the location where the virtual register is supposed to be; found before being stored or after being reloaded. If the indirect strategy is used, after all the virtual registers have been; mapped to physical registers or stack slots, it is necessary to use a spiller; object to place load and store instructions in the code. Every virtual that has; been mapped to a stack slot will be stored to memory after being defined and will; be loaded before being used. The implementation of the spiller tries to recycle; load/store instructions, avoiding unnecessary instructions. For an example of; how to invoke the spiller, see ``RegAllocLinearScan::runOnMachineFunction`` in; ``lib/CodeGen/RegAllocLinearScan.cpp``. Handling two address instructions; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. With very rare exceptions (e.g., function calls), the LLVM machine code; instructions are three address instructions. That is, each instruction is; expected to define at most one register, and to use at most two registers.; However, some architectures use two address instructions. In this case, the; defined register is also one of the used registers. For instance, an instruction; such as ``ADD %EAX, %EBX``, in X86 is actually equivalent to ``%EAX = %EAX +; %EBX``. In order to produce correct code, LLVM must convert three address instructions; that represent two address instructions into true two address instructions.

That thread would read `undef` instead of the value it was; expecting, which can lead to undefined behavior down the line. (This example is; particularly of interest because before the concurrency model was implemented,; LLVM would perform this transformation.). Note that speculative loads are allowed; a load which is part of a race returns; ``undef``, but does not have undefined behavior. Atomic instructions; ===================. For cases where simple loads and stores are not sufficient, LLVM provides; various atomic instructions. The exact guarantees provided depend on the; ordering; see `Atomic orderings`_. ``load atomic`` and ``store atomic`` provide the same basic functionality as; non-atomic loads and stores, but provide additional guarantees in situations; where threads and signals are involved. ``cmpxchg`` and ``atomicrmw`` are essentially like an atomic load followed by an; atomic store (where the store is conditional for ``cmpxchg``), but no other; memory operation can happen on any thread between the load and store.

We are proposing a comprehensive; mitigation approach that would apply automatically across an entire program; rather than through manual changes to the code.

Typical slowdown introduced by AddressSanitizer is **2x**. How to build; ============. Build LLVM/Clang with `CMake <https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html>` and enable; the ``compiler-rt`` runtime. An example CMake configuration that will allow; for the use/testing of AddressSanitizer:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=""clang"" -DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES=""compiler-rt"" <path to source>/llvm. Usage; =====. Simply compile and link your program with ``-fsanitize=address`` flag. The; AddressSanitizer run-time library should be linked to the final executable, so; make sure to use ``clang`` (not ``ld``) for the final link step. When linking; shared libraries, the AddressSanitizer run-time is not linked, so; ``-Wl,-z,defs`` may cause link errors (don't use it with AddressSanitizer). To; get a reasonable performance add ``-O1`` or higher. To get nicer stack traces; in error messages add ``-fno-omit-frame-pointer``. To get perfect stack traces; you may need to disable inlining (just use ``-O1``) and tail call elimination; (``-fno-optimize-sibling-calls``). .. code-block:: console. % cat example_UseAfterFree.cc; int main(int argc, char **argv) {; int *array = new int[100];; delete [] array;; return array[argc]; // BOOM; }. # Compile and link; % clang++ -O1 -g -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer example_UseAfterFree.cc. or:. .. code-block:: console. # Compile; % clang++ -O1 -g -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -c example_UseAfterFree.cc; # Link; % clang++ -g -fsanitize=address example_UseAfterFree.o. If a bug is detected, the program will print an error message to stderr and; exit with a non-zero exit code. AddressSanitizer exits on the first detected error.; This is by design:. * This approach allows AddressSanitizer to produce faster and smaller generated code; (both by ~5%).;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AddressSanitizer.rst:1607,perform,performance,1607,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AddressSanitizer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AddressSanitizer.rst,1,['perform'],['performance']
Performance,"erage Wait times* helps diagnose performance issues that are caused by; the presence of long latency instructions and potentially long data dependencies; which may limit the ILP. Last row, ``<total>``, shows a global average over all; instructions measured. Note that :program:`llvm-mca`, by default, assumes at; least 1cy between the dispatch event and the issue event. When the performance is limited by data dependencies and/or long latency; instructions, the number of cycles spent while in the *ready* state is expected; to be very small when compared with the total number of cycles spent in the; scheduler's queue. The difference between the two counters is a good indicator; of how large of an impact data dependencies had on the execution of the; instructions. When performance is mostly limited by the lack of hardware; resources, the delta between the two counters is small. However, the number of; cycles spent in the queue tends to be larger (i.e., more than 1-3cy),; especially when compared to other low latency instructions. Bottleneck Analysis; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; The ``-bottleneck-analysis`` command line option enables the analysis of; performance bottlenecks. This analysis is potentially expensive.

It is possible to perform the one-dimensional minimization/maximization of a function by using directly the function class in ROOT, `TF1` of the *Hist* library.; The minmization is implemented in `TF1` using the BrentMInimizer1D and available with the class member functions; * `TF1::GetMinimum`/`TF1::GetMaximum` to find the function minimum/maximum value; * `TF1::GetMinimumX`/`TF1::GetMaximumX` to find the x value corresponding at the function minimum.

All the algorithms for multi-dimensional minimization are implementing the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer`; interface and they can be used in the same way and one can switch between minimizer at run-time.; The minimizer concrete class can be in different ROOT libraries and they can be instantiate using the ROOT; plug-in manager.; More information on multi-dimensional minimization is provided in the Fit",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:65846,perform,perform,65846,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['perform'],['perform']
Performance,"erations in particular), make sure; it doesn't replace an atomic load or store with a non-atomic operation. Some examples of how optimizations interact with various kinds of atomic; operations:. * ``memcpyopt``: An atomic operation cannot be optimized into part of a; memcpy/memset, including unordered loads/stores. It can pull operations; across some atomic operations. * LICM: Unordered loads/stores can be moved out of a loop. It just treats; monotonic operations like a read+write to a memory location, and anything; stricter than that like a nothrow call. * DSE: Unordered stores can be DSE'ed like normal stores. Monotonic stores can; be DSE'ed in some cases, but it's tricky to reason about, and not especially; important. It is possible in some case for DSE to operate across a stronger; atomic operation, but it is fairly tricky. DSE delegates this reasoning to; MemoryDependencyAnalysis (which is also used by other passes like GVN). * Folding a load: Any atomic load from a constant global can be constant-folded,; because it cannot be observed. Similar reasoning allows sroa with; atomic loads and stores. Atomics and Codegen; ===================. Atomic operations are represented in the SelectionDAG with ``ATOMIC_*`` opcodes.; On architectures which use barrier instructions for all atomic ordering (like; ARM), appropriate fences can be emitted by the AtomicExpand Codegen pass if; ``shouldInsertFencesForAtomic()`` returns true. The MachineMemOperand for all atomic operations is currently marked as volatile;; this is not correct in the IR sense of volatile, but CodeGen handles anything; marked volatile very conservatively. This should get fixed at some point. One very important property of the atomic operations is that if your backend; supports any inline lock-free atomic operations of a given size, you should; support *ALL* operations of that size in a lock-free manner.

More precisely, the behavior is as-if any memory written through the; pointer during the execution of the function is overwritten with a poison; value on unwind.

Example::. {{{module:1:libc.so:elf:83238ab56ba10497}}}. ``{{{mmap:%p:%i:...}}}``. This contextual element is used to give information about a particular region; in memory. ``%p`` is the starting address and ``%i`` gives the size in hex of the; region of memory. The ``...`` part can take different forms to give different; information about the specified region of memory. The allowed forms are the; following:. * ``load:%i:%s:%p``. This subelement informs the filter that a segment was loaded from a module.; The module is identified by its module ID ``%i``. The ``%s`` is one or more of; the letters 'r', 'w', and 'x' (in that order and in either upper or lower; case) to indicate this segment of memory is readable, writable, and/or; executable. The symbolizing filter can use this information to guess whether; an address is a likely code address or a likely data address in the given; module. The remaining ``%p`` gives the module relative address. For ELF files; the module relative address will be the ``p_vaddr`` of the associated program; header. For example if your module's executable segment has; ``p_vaddr=0x1000``, ``p_memsz=0x1234``, and was loaded at ``0x7acba69d5000``; then you need to subtract ``0x7acba69d4000`` from any address between; ``0x7acba69d5000`` and ``0x7acba69d6234`` to get the module relative address.; The starting address will usually have been rounded down to the active page; size, and the size rounded up.

Performance,"erializing an; Objective-C method declaration (or other Objective-C construct) that refers to; the selector. AST Reader Integration Points; -----------------------------. The ""lazy"" deserialization behavior of AST files requires their integration; into several completely different submodules of Clang. For example, lazily; deserializing the declarations during name lookup requires that the name-lookup; routines be able to query the AST file to find entities stored there. For each Clang data structure that requires direct interaction with the AST; reader logic, there is an abstract class that provides the interface between; the two modules. The ``ASTReader`` class, which handles the loading of an AST; file, inherits from all of these abstract classes to provide lazy; deserialization of Clang's data structures. ``ASTReader`` implements the; following abstract classes:. ``ExternalSLocEntrySource``; This abstract interface is associated with the ``SourceManager`` class, and; is used whenever the :ref:`source manager <pchinternals-sourcemgr>` needs to; load the details of a file, buffer, or macro instantiation. ``IdentifierInfoLookup``; This abstract interface is associated with the ``IdentifierTable`` class, and; is used whenever the program source refers to an identifier that has not yet; been seen. In this case, the AST reader searches for this identifier within; its :ref:`identifier table <pchinternals-ident-table>` to load any top-level; declarations or macros associated with that identifier. ``ExternalASTSource``; This abstract interface is associated with the ``ASTContext`` class, and is; used whenever the abstract syntax tree nodes need to loaded from the AST; file. It provides the ability to de-serialize declarations and types; identified by their numeric values, read the bodies of functions when; required, and read the declarations stored within a declaration context; (either for iteration or for name lookup). ``ExternalSemaSource``; This abstract interface is a",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst:22394,load,load,22394,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,1,['load'],['load']

A cost model is therefore employed to identify the; best alternative, including the alternative of avoiding any transformation; altogether. The Vectorization Plan is an explicit model for describing vectorization; candidates. It serves for both optimizing candidates including estimating their; cost reliably, and for performing their final translation into IR. This; facilitates dealing with multiple vectorization candidates. High-level Design; =================. Vectorization Workflow; ----------------------; VPlan-based vectorization involves three major steps, taking a ""scenario-based; approach"" to vectorization planning:. 1. Legal Step: check if a loop can be legally vectorized; encode constraints and; artifacts if so.; 2. Plan Step:. a. Build initial VPlans following the constraints and decisions taken by; Legal Step 1, and compute their cost.; b. Apply optimizations to the VPlans, possibly forking additional VPlans.; Prune sub-optimal VPlans having relatively high cost.; 3. Execute Step: materialize the best VPlan. Note that this is the only step; that modifies the IR. Design Guidelines; -----------------; In what follows, the term ""input IR"" refers to code that is fed into the; vectorizer whereas the term ""output IR"" refers to code that is generated by the; vectorizer. The output IR contains code that has been vectorized or ""widened""; according to a loop Vectorization Factor (VF), and/or loop unroll-and-jammed; according to an Unroll Factor (UF).; The design of VPlan follows several high-level guidelines:. 1. Analysis-like: building and manipulating VPlans must not modify the input IR.; In particular, if the best option is not to vectorize at all, the; vectorization process terminates before reaching Step 3, and compilation; should proceed as if VPlans had not been built. 2.

Performance,"erpret the; stack map record given only the ID, offset, and the order of the; locations, records, and functions, which LLVM preserves. Note that this is quite different from the goal of debug information,; which is a best-effort attempt to track the location of named; variables at every instruction. An important motivation for this design is to allow a runtime to; commandeer a stack frame when execution reaches an instruction address; associated with a stack map. The runtime must be able to rebuild a; stack frame and resume program execution using the information; provided by the stack map. For example, execution may resume in an; interpreter or a recompiled version of the same function. This usage restricts LLVM optimization. Clearly, LLVM must not move; stores across a stack map. However, loads must also be handled; conservatively. If the load may trigger an exception, hoisting it; above a stack map could be invalid. For example, the runtime may; determine that a load is safe to execute without a type check given; the current state of the type system. If the type system changes while; some activation of the load's function exists on the stack, the load; becomes unsafe. The runtime can prevent subsequent execution of that; load by immediately patching any stack map location that lies between; the current call site and the load (typically, the runtime would; simply patch all stack map locations to invalidate the function). If; the compiler had hoisted the load above the stack map, then the; program could crash before the runtime could take back control. To enforce these semantics, stackmap and patchpoint intrinsics are; considered to potentially read and write all memory. This may limit; optimization more than some clients desire. This limitation may be; avoided by marking the call site as ""readonly"". In the future we may; also allow meta-data to be added to the intrinsic call to express; aliasing, thereby allowing optimizations to hoist certain loads above; stack ma",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst:18150,load,load,18150,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,1,['load'],['load']

We can generalize the previous idea and sink the hardening down the expression; graph across as many data-invariant operations as desirable. This can use very; conservative rules for whether something is data-invariant.

Sadly, there are no useful instructions on x86 that apply a mask to all 64 bits; without touching the flag registers. However, we can harden loaded values that; are narrower than a word (fewer than 32-bits on 32-bit systems and fewer than; 64-bits on 64-bit systems) by zero-extending the value to the full word size; and then shifting right by at least the number of original bits using the BMI2; `shrx` instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate 32 bits of data.; shrxq %rax, %rdi, %rdi # Shift out all 32 bits loaded.; ```. Because on x86 the zero-extend is free, this can efficiently harden the loaded; value. ##### Hardening the address of the load. When hardening the loaded value is inapplicable, most often because the; instruction directly leaks information (like `cmp` or `jmpq`), we switch to; hardening the _address_ of the load instead of the loaded value. This avoids; increasing register pressure by unfolding the load or paying some other high; cost.

Bitconverts; -----------. .. image:: ARM-BE-bitcastfail.png; :align: right. The main problem with the ``LD1`` solution is dealing with bitconverts (or bitcasts, or reinterpret casts). These are pseudo instructions that only change the compiler's interpretation of data, not the underlying data itself. A requirement is that if data is loaded and then saved again (called a ""round trip""), the memory contents should be the same after the store as before the load. If a vector is loaded and is then bitconverted to a different vector type before storing, the round trip will currently be broken. Take for example this code sequence::. %0 = load <4 x i32> %x; %1 = bitcast <4 x i32> %0 to <2 x i64>; store <2 x i64> %1, <2 x i64>* %y. This would produce a code sequence such as that in the figure on the right. The mismatched ``LD1`` and ``ST1`` cause the stored data to differ from the loaded data. .. container:: clearer.

Conceptually this is simple - we can insert a ``REV`` undoing the ``LD1`` of type ``X`` (converting the in-register representation to the same as if it had been loaded by ``LDR``) and then insert another ``REV`` to change the representation to be as if it had been loaded by an ``LD1`` of type ``Y``.

The main difference is that; ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>`` will load the BMI eagerly, whereas; ``-fmodule-file=<module-name>=<path/to/BMI>`` will only load the BMI lazily, which is similar; with ``-fprebuilt-module-path``.

Imagine that the SUB32rr were moved forward to give us the following MIR:. .. code-block:: text. %7:gr32 = SUB32rr %6, %5, implicit-def dead $eflags; %1:gr32 = MOV32rm %0, 1, $noreg, 4, $noreg, debug-location !5 :: (load 4 from %ir.addr1); DBG_VALUE %1, $noreg, !1, !2; %4:gr32 = ADD32rr %3, %2, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %4, $noreg, !3, !4; DBG_VALUE %7, $noreg, !5, !6. In this circumstance LLVM would leave the MIR as shown above. Were we to move; the DBG_VALUE of virtual register %7 upwards with the SUB32rr, we would re-order; assignments and introduce a new state of the program. Whereas with the solution; above, the debugger will see one fewer combination of variable values, because; ``!3`` and ``!5`` will change value at the same time. This is preferred over; misrepresenting the original program. In comparison, if one sunk the MOV32rm, LLVM would produce the following:. .. code-block:: text. DBG_VALUE $noreg, $noreg, !1, !2; %4:gr32 = ADD32rr %3, %2, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %4, $noreg, !3, !4; %7:gr32 = SUB32rr %6, %5, implicit-def dead $eflags; DBG_VALUE %7, $noreg, !5, !6; %1:gr32 = MOV32rm %0, 1, $noreg, 4, $noreg, de",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst:33954,load,load,33954,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.rst,1,['load'],['load']

Performance,"es a list of; passes, ensures their :ref:`prerequisites <writing-an-llvm-pass-interaction>`; are set up correctly, and then schedules passes to run efficiently. All of the; LLVM tools that run passes use the PassManager for execution of these passes. The PassManager does two main things to try to reduce the execution time of a; series of passes:. #. **Share analysis results.** The ``PassManager`` attempts to avoid; recomputing analysis results as much as possible. This means keeping track; of which analyses are available already, which analyses get invalidated, and; which analyses are needed to be run for a pass. An important part of work; is that the ``PassManager`` tracks the exact lifetime of all analysis; results, allowing it to :ref:`free memory; <writing-an-llvm-pass-releaseMemory>` allocated to holding analysis results; as soon as they are no longer needed. #. **Pipeline the execution of passes on the program.** The ``PassManager``; attempts to get better cache and memory usage behavior out of a series of; passes by pipelining the passes together. This means that, given a series; of consecutive :ref:`FunctionPass <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>`, it; will execute all of the :ref:`FunctionPass; <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>` on the first function, then all of the; :ref:`FunctionPasses <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>` on the second; function, etc... until the entire program has been run through the passes. This improves the cache behavior of the compiler, because it is only; touching the LLVM program representation for a single function at a time,; instead of traversing the entire program. It reduces the memory consumption; of compiler, because, for example, only one `DominatorSet; <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1DominatorSet.html>`_ needs to be; calculated at a time. The effectiveness of the ``PassManager`` is influenced directly by how much; information it has about the behaviors of the passes it is scheduling.

Since this; example was generated using 3 iterations: ``-iterations=3``, the iteration; indices range from 0-2 inclusively. Excluding the first and last column, the remaining columns are in cycles.; Cycles are numbered sequentially starting from 0. From the example output above, we know the following:. * Instruction [1,0] was dispatched at cycle 1.; * Instruction [1,0] started executing at cycle 2.; * Instruction [1,0] reached the write back stage at cycle 4.; * Instruction [1,0] was retired at cycle 10. Instruction [1,0] (i.e., vmulps from iteration #1) does not have to wait in the; scheduler's queue for the operands to become available. By the time vmulps is; dispatched, operands are already available, and pipeline JFPU1 is ready to; serve another instruction. So the instruction can be immediately issued on the; JFPU1 pipeline. That is demonstrated by the fact that the instruction only; spent 1cy in the scheduler's queue. There is a gap of 5 cycles between the write-back stage and the retire event.; That is because instructions must retire in program order, so [1,0] has to wait; for [0,2] to be retired first (i.e., it has to wait until cycle 10). In the example, all instructions are in a RAW (Read After Write) dependency; chain. Register %xmm2 written by vmulps is immediately used by the first; vhaddps, and register %xmm3 written by the first vhaddps is used by the second; vhaddps. Long data dependencies negatively impact the ILP (Instruction Level; Parallelism). In the dot-product example, there are anti-dependencies introduced by; instructions from different iterations.

What performs better, run-time or compile-time?; The obvious answer is compile-time: see the performance differences between; C++ and Python, for example.; Obvious, but completely wrong, however.; In fact, when it comes to Python, it is even the `wrong question.`. Everything in Python is run-time: modules, classes, functions, etc. are all; run-time constructs.; A Python module that defines a class is a set of instructions to the Python; interpreter that lead to the construction of the desired class object.; A C/C++ extension module that defines a class does the same thing by calling; a succession of Python interpreter Application Programming Interfaces (APIs;; the exact same that Python uses itself internally).; If you use a compile-time binder such as `SWIG`_ or `pybind11`_ to bind a C++; class, then what gets compiled is the series of API calls necessary to; construct a Python-side equivalent at `run-time` (when the module gets; loaded), not the Python class object.; In short, whether a binding is created at ""compile-time"" or at run-time has; no measurable bearing on performance. What does affect performance is the overhead to cross the language barrier.; This consists of unboxing Python objects to extract or convert the underlying; objects or data to something that matches what C++ expects; overload; resolution based on the unboxed arguments; offset calculations; and finally; the actual dispatch.; As a practical matter, overload resolution is the most costly part, followed; by the unboxing and conversion.; Best performance is achieved by specialization of the paths through the; run-time: recognize early the case at hand and select an optimized path.; For that reason, `PyPy`_ is so fast: JIT-ed traces operate on unboxed objects; and resolved overloads are baked into the trace, incurring no further cost.; Similarly, th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst:1583,load,loaded,1583,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/philosophy.rst,1,['load'],['loaded']
Performance,"es are ""tiny"", ""small"", ""kernel"", ""medium"", ""large"".; This may be extended in the future to specify global data layout that; doesn't cleanly fit into a specific code model. By default, global initializers are optimized by assuming that global; variables defined within the module are not modified from their; initial values before the start of the global initializer. This is; true even for variables potentially accessible from outside the; module, including those with external linkage or appearing in; ``@llvm.used`` or dllexported variables. This assumption may be suppressed; by marking the variable with ``externally_initialized``. An explicit alignment may be specified for a global, which must be a; power of 2. If not present, or if the alignment is set to zero, the; alignment of the global is set by the target to whatever it feels; convenient. If an explicit alignment is specified, the global is forced; to have exactly that alignment. Targets and optimizers are not allowed; to over-align the global if the global has an assigned section. In this; case, the extra alignment could be observable: for example, code could; assume that the globals are densely packed in their section and try to; iterate over them as an array, alignment padding would break this; iteration. For TLS variables, the module flag ``MaxTLSAlign``, if present,; limits the alignment to the given value. Optimizers are not allowed to; impose a stronger alignment on these variables. The maximum alignment; is ``1 << 32``. For global variable declarations, as well as definitions that may be; replaced at link time (``linkonce``, ``weak``, ``extern_weak`` and ``common``; linkage types), the allocation size and alignment of the definition it resolves; to must be greater than or equal to that of the declaration or replaceable; definition, otherwise the behavior is undefined.

Performance,"es. The scalar and vector caches are; invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data; may change between kernel dispatch executions. See; :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`. The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this; case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never; accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used; then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function; return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a; future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that; creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a; ``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread. For kernarg backing memory:. * CP invalidates the L1 cache at the start of each kernel dispatch.; * On dGPU the kernarg backing memory is allocated in host memory accessed as; MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid needing to invalidate the L2 cache. This also; causes it to be treated as non-volatile and so is not invalidated by; ``*_vol``.; * On APU the kernarg backing memory it is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent); and so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents. Scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space) is accessed; with MTYPE NC_NV (non-coherent non-volatile). Since the private address space is; only accessed by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is; never a need to invalidate these entries from the L1 cache. Hence all cache; invalidates are done as ``*_vol`` to only invalidate the volatile cache lines.

Performance,"escribed in the :doc:`AdvancedBuilds` document. General Distribution Guidance; =============================. When building a distribution of a compiler it is generally advised to perform a; bootstrap build of the compiler. That means building a ""stage 1"" compiler with; your host toolchain, then building the ""stage 2"" compiler using the ""stage 1""; compiler. This is done so that the compiler you distribute benefits from all the; bug fixes, performance optimizations and general improvements provided by the; new compiler. In deciding how to build your distribution there are a few trade-offs that you; will need to evaluate. The big two are:. #. Compile time of the distribution against performance of the built compiler. #. Binary size of the distribution against performance of the built compiler. The guidance for maximizing performance of the generated compiler is to use LTO,; PGO, and statically link everything. This will result in an overall larger; distribution, and it will take longer to generate, but it provides the most; opportunity for the compiler to optimize. The guidance for minimizing distribution size is to dynamically link LLVM and; Clang libraries into the tools to reduce code duplication. This will come at a; substantial performance penalty to the generated binary both because it reduces; optimization opportunity, and because dynamic linking requires resolving symbols; at process launch time, which can be very slow for C++ code. .. _shared_libs:. .. warning::; One very important note: Distributions should never be built using the; *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake option. That option exists for optimizing developer; workflow only. Due to design and implementation decisions, LLVM relies on; global data which can end up being duplicated across shared libraries; resulting in bugs. As such this is not a safe way to distribute LLVM or; LLVM-based tools. The simplest example of building a distribution with reasonable performance is; captured in the DistributionExample C",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst:1677,optimiz,optimize,1677,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimize']
Performance,"esponding to the object being called (i.e., the ""receiver"" in Objective-C; parlance), which ExprEngine uses to decide whether or not the call should be; inlined. Inlining Dynamic Calls; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The -analyzer-config ipa option has five different modes: none, basic-inlining,; inlining, dynamic, and dynamic-bifurcate. Under -analyzer-config ipa=dynamic,; all dynamic calls are inlined, whether we are certain or not that this will; actually be the definition used at runtime. Under -analyzer-config ipa=inlining,; only ""near-perfect"" devirtualized calls are inlined*, and other dynamic calls; are evaluated conservatively (as if no definition were available). * Currently, no Objective-C messages are not inlined under; -analyzer-config ipa=inlining, even if we are reasonably confident of the type; of the receiver. We plan to enable this once we have tested our heuristics; more thoroughly. The last option, -analyzer-config ipa=dynamic-bifurcate, behaves similarly to; ""dynamic"", but performs a conservative invalidation in the general virtual case; in *addition* to inlining. The details of this are discussed below. As stated above, -analyzer-config ipa=basic-inlining does not inline any C++; member functions or Objective-C method calls, even if they are non-virtual or; can be safely devirtualized. Bifurcation; ^^^^^^^^^^^. ExprEngine::BifurcateCall implements the ``-analyzer-config ipa=dynamic-bifurcate``; mode. When a call is made on an object with imprecise dynamic type information; (RuntimeDefinition::mayHaveOtherDefinitions() evaluates to TRUE), ExprEngine; bifurcates the path and marks the object's region (retrieved from the; RuntimeDefinition object) with a path-sensitive ""mode"" in the ProgramState.

Performance,"esponds to a developers’ intuitions, allowing them to make changes in; their code, and to see the result of these changes without interrupting the; running program. Interactive programming gives programmers the freedom to; explore different scenarios while developing software, writing one expression; at a time, figuring out what to do next at each step, and enabling them to; quickly identify and fix bugs whenever they arise. As an example, the; High-Energy Physics community includes professionals with a variety of; backgrounds, including physicists, nuclear engineers, and software; engineers. Cling allows for interactive data analysis in `ROOT; <https://root.cern/>`_ by giving researchers a way to prototype their C++ code,; allowing them to tailor it to the particular scope of the analysis they want to; pursue on a particular set of data before being added to the main framework. **Interpreted language** is a way to achieve interactive programming. In; statically compiled language, all source code is converted into native machine; code and then executed by the processor before being run. An interpreted; language instead runs through source programs line by line, taking an; executable segment of source code, turning it into machine code, and then; executing it. With this approach, when a change is made by the programmer, the; interpreter will convey it without the need for the entire source code to be; manually compiled. Interpreted languages are flexible, and offer features like; dynamic typing and smaller program size. **Cling** is not an interpreter, it is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that feels; like an interpreter, and allows C++, a language designed to be compiled, to be; interpreted. When using Cling, the programmer benefits from both the power of; C++ language, such as high-performance, robustness, fastness, efficiency,; versatility, and the capability of an interpreter, which allows for interactive; exploration and on-the-fly inspection of the source-code.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/cling/docs/chapters/interactivity.rst:2047,perform,performance,2047,interpreter/cling/docs/chapters/interactivity.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/cling/docs/chapters/interactivity.rst,1,['perform'],['performance']
Performance,"ess of an aggregate argument that is being passed by; value through memory. Primarily, this feature is required for; compatibility with the Microsoft C++ ABI. Under that ABI, class; instances that are passed by value are constructed directly into; argument stack memory. Prior to the addition of inalloca, calls in LLVM; were indivisible instructions. There was no way to perform intermediate; work, such as object construction, between the first stack adjustment; and the final control transfer. With inalloca, all arguments passed in; memory are modelled as a single alloca, which can be stored to prior to; the call. Unfortunately, this complicated feature comes with a large; set of restrictions designed to bound the lifetime of the argument; memory around the call. For now, it is recommended that frontends and optimizers avoid producing; this construct, primarily because it forces the use of a base pointer.; This feature may grow in the future to allow general mid-level; optimization, but for now, it should be regarded as less efficient than; passing by value with a copy.

Except for `ROOT v3.10`, the algorithms are all based on an; `LU `factorization followed by forward/back-substitution. `ROOT v3.10`; is using the slower Gaussian elimination method. The numerical accuracy; of the `CLHEP` routine is poor:. - up to 6x6 the numerical imprecise Cramer multiplication is hard-coded.; For instance, calculating `U=H*H-1`, where `H` is a (5x5) Hilbert; matrix, results in off-diagonal elements of $10^{-7}$ instead of the $10^{-13}$; using an `LU `according to `Crout`. - scaling protection is non-existent and limits are hard-coded, as a; consequence inversion of a Hilbert matrix for `sizes>(12x12)` fails. In; order to gain speed the `CLHEP` algorithm stores its permutation info of; the pivots points in a static array, making multi-threading not; possible. `GSL` uses LU decomposition without the implicit scaling of `Crout`.; Therefore, its accuracy is not as good. For instance a (10x10) Hilbert; matrix has errors 10 times larger than the `LU Crout` result. In; `ROOT v4.0`, the user can choose between the `Invert()` and; `IvertFast()` routines, where the latter is using the Cramer algorithm; for `sizes<7x7`. The speed graph shows the result for `InvertFast()`. 3. `A*x=b` the execution time is measured for solving the linear; equation `A*x=b`. The same factorizations are used as in the matrix; inversion. However, only 1 forward/back-substitution has to be used; instead of msize as in the inversion of (msize x msize) matrix. As a; consequence the same differences are observed but less amplified.

It can be used to express the maximum acceptable error in the; result of that instruction, in ULPs, thus potentially allowing the; compiler to use a more efficient but less accurate method of computing; it. ULP is defined as follows:. If ``x`` is a real number that lies between two finite consecutive; floating-point numbers ``a`` and ``b``, without being equal to one; of them, then ``ulp(x) = |b - a|``, otherwise ``ulp(x)`` is the; distance between the two non-equal finite floating-point numbers; nearest ``x``. Moreover, ``ulp(NaN)`` is ``NaN``. The metadata node shall consist of a single positive float type number; representing the maximum relative error, for example:. .. code-block:: llvm. !0 = !{ float 2.5 } ; maximum acceptable inaccuracy is 2.5 ULPs. .. _range-metadata:. '``range``' Metadata; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``range`` metadata may be attached only to ``load``, ``call`` and ``invoke`` of; integer or vector of integer types. It expresses the possible ranges the loaded; value or the value returned by the called function at this call site is in. If; the loaded or returned value is not in the specified range, a poison value is; returned instead. The ranges are represented with a flattened list of integers.; The loaded value or the value returned is known to be in the union of the ranges; defined by each consecutive pair. Each pair has the following properties:. - The type must match the scalar type of the instruction.; - The pair ``a,b`` represents the range ``[a,b)``.; - Both ``a`` and ``b`` are constants.; - The range is allowed to wrap.; - The range should not represent the full or empty set. That is,; ``a!=b``. In addition, the pairs must be in signed order of the lower bound and; they must be non-contiguous. For vector-typed instructions, the range is applied element-wise.

Performance,"etry, or it may simply happen that they really represent a; single object, too complex to be described by a primitive shape. Usually handling structures like these can be easily done by positioning; all components in the same container volume, then positioning the; container itself. However, there are many practical cases when defining; such a container is not straightforward or even possible without; generating overlaps with the rest of the geometry. There are few ways; out of this:. - Defining the container for the structure as ""overlapping"" (see also; ""Overlapping Volumes""); - Representing the container as a composite shape - the Boolean union; of all components (see also ""Composite Shapes""); - Using an assembly volume - this will be described in the following. The first two approaches have the disadvantage of penalizing the; navigation performance with a factor increasing more than linear of the; number of components in the structure. The best solution is the third; one because it uses all volume-related navigation optimizations. The; class TGeoVolumeAssembly represents an assembly volume. Its shape; is represented by TGeoShapeAssembly class that is the union of all; components. It uses volume voxelization to perform navigation tasks. An assembly volume creates a hierarchical level and it geometrically; insulates the structure from the rest (as a normal volume). Physically,; a point that is INSIDE a TGeoShapeAssembly is always inside one of; the components, so a TGeoVolumeAssembly does not need to have a; medium. Due to the self-containment of assemblies, they are very; practical to use when a container is hard to define due to possible; overlaps during positioning. For instance, it is very easy creating; honeycomb structures. A very useful example for creating and using; assemblies can be found at: assembly.C. Creation of an assembly is very easy: one has just to create a; TGeoVolumeAssembly object and position the components inside as; for any volume:. ~~~{.cpp",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/geom/geom/doc/index.md:49603,optimiz,optimizations,49603,geom/geom/doc/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/geom/geom/doc/index.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']

We cache these errors in cases of declarations. During the next import; call if there is an existing error we just return with that. So, clients of the; library receive an Error object, which they must check. During import of a specific declaration, it may happen that some AST nodes had; already been created before we recognize an error. In this case, we signal back; the error to the caller, but the ""to"" context remains polluted with those nodes; which had been created. Ideally, those nodes should not had been created, but; that time we did not know about the error, the error happened later. Since the; AST is immutable (most of the cases we can't remove existing nodes) we choose; to mark these nodes as erroneous. We cache the errors associated with declarations in the ""from"" context in; ``ASTImporter::ImportDeclErrors`` and the ones which are associated with the; ""to"" context in ``ASTImporterSharedState::ImportErrors``. Note that, there may; be several ASTImporter objects which import into the same ""to"" context but from; different ""from"" contexts; in this case, they have to share the associated; errors of the ""to"" context.

Let us look at a simple example of a toy experiment comparing two; methods to fit a function to a histogram, the $\chi^{2}$. method and a method called ""binned log-likelihood fit"", both available in ROOT. As a very simple yet powerful quantity to check the quality of the fit; results, we construct for each pseudo-data set the so-called ""pull"", the; difference of the estimated and the true value of a parameter,; normalised to the estimated error on the parameter,; $\frac{(p_{estim} - p_{true})}{\sigma_{p}}$. If everything is OK, the; distribution of the pull values is a standard normal distribution, i.e.; a Gaussian distribution centred around zero with a standard deviation of one. The macro performs a rather big number of toy experiments, where a; histogram is repeatedly filled with Gaussian distributed numbers,; representing the pseudo-data in this example.

The behaviour of a ROOT session can be tailored with the options in the; `.rootrc` file. Examples of the tunable parameters are the ones related; to the operating and window system, to the fonts to be used, to the; location of start-up files. At start-up, ROOT looks for a `.rootrc` file; in the following order:. - `./.rootrc //local directory`. - `$HOME/.rootrc //user directory`. - `$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc //global ROOT directory`. If more than one `.rootrc` files are found in the search paths above,; the options are merged, with precedence local, user, global. The parsing; and interpretation of this file is handled by the ROOT class `TEnv`.; Have a look to its documentation if you need such rather advanced; features. The file `.rootrc` defines the location of two rather; important files inspected at start-up: `rootalias.C` and `rootlogon.C`.; They can contain code that needs to be loaded and executed at ROOT; startup. `rootalias.C` is only loaded and best used to define some often; used functions. `rootlogon.C` contains code that will be executed at; startup: this file is extremely useful for example to pre-load a custom; style for the plots created with ROOT. This is done most easily by; creating a new `TStyle` object with your preferred settings, as; described in the class reference guide, and then use the command; `gROOT->SetStyle(""MyStyleName"");` to make this new style definition the; default one. As an example, have a look in the file `rootlogon.C` coming; with this tutorial. Another relevant file is `rootlogoff.C` that it; called when the session is finished. ### ROOT command history ###.

Specifically, ARC is sometimes permitted to optimize ``release``; operations in ways which might cause an object to be deallocated; before it would otherwise be. Without this, it would be almost; impossible to eliminate any ``retain``/``release`` pairs. For; example, consider the following code:. .. code-block:: objc. id x = _ivar;; [x foo];. If we were not permitted in any event to shorten the lifetime of the; object in ``x``, then we would not be able to eliminate this retain; and release unless we could prove that the message send could not; modify ``_ivar`` (or deallocate ``self``). Since message sends are; opaque to the optimizer, this is not possible, and so ARC's hands; would be almost completely tied. ARC makes no guarantees about the execution of a computation history; which contains undefined behavior. In particular, ARC makes no; guarantees in the presence of race conditions. ARC may assume that any retainable object pointers it receives or; generates are instantaneously valid from that point until a point; which, by the concurrency model of the host language, happens-after; the generation of the pointer and happens-before a release of that; object (possibly via an aliasing pointer or indirectly due to; destruction of a different object). .. admonition:: Rationale.

Kernel Dispatch; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. The HSA architected queuing language (AQL) defines a user space memory interface; that can be used to control the dispatch of kernels, in an agent independent; way. An agent can have zero or more AQL queues created for it using an HSA; compatible runtime (see :ref:`amdgpu-os`), in which AQL packets (all of which; are 64 bytes) can be placed. See the *HSA Platform System Architecture; Specification* [HSA]_ for the AQL queue mechanics and packet layouts. The packet processor of a kernel agent is responsible for detecting and; dispatching HSA kernels from the AQL queues associated with it. For AMD GPUs the; packet processor is implemented by the hardware command processor (CP),; asynchronous dispatch controller (ADC) and shader processor input controller; (SPI). An HSA compatible runtime can be used to allocate an AQL queue object. It uses; the kernel mode driver to initialize and register the AQL queue with CP. To dispatch a kernel the following actions are performed. This can occur in the; CPU host program, or from an HSA kernel executing on a GPU. 1. A pointer to an AQL queue for the kernel agent on which the kernel is to be; executed is obtained.; 2.

Performance,"ew algorithmic optimization in the caching of pdfs. So far - in the likelihood - two classes of; objects are identified: those that change with every event (i.e. the pdf) and those that change; only with the parameters (typically pdf normalization integrals). Pdfs are always recalculated; for every event, whereas integrals are only evaluated when needed. The exception to the first type are pdfs; that only depend on constant parameters (or no parameters) - these are identified at the beginning, and precalculated once ; to avoid recalculating an expression with the same outcome for every iteration of the likelihood calculation. For composite pdfs a further optimization has been included: for a M(x,a,b) = f*F(x,a)+(1-f)G(x,b) ; it is e.g. not needed to recalculate G(x,b) if only parameter a has changed w.r.t to the previous likelihood; calculation. This optimization is now implemented by extending the value caching originally designed; for constant terms to be usable for non-constant terms, with a check executed at the beginning of each; likelihood evaluation if selected columns need to be updated because parameters have changed. The speed gain; of this optimization depends much on the structure of the pdf: in models with many free parameters most of the; likelihood evaluations are executed when MINUIT calculates numerical likelihood derivatives which vary ; one parameter at a time and the speedup is potentially larger. In models with few free parameters the; effect will be smaller. The new per-component caching strategy is enabled by default for all pdfs that are a component of; a RooAddPdf or a RooRealSumPdf, unless that component is a RooProdPdf or a RooProduct, in that; case the components of the product are cached instead of the product itself.

As currently implemented, RewriteStatepointsForGC must be; run after SSA construction (i.e. mem2ref).

It will do so by duplicating code as needed to; propagate the base pointer associated with each pointer being relocated to; the appropriate safepoints.

Constant pointers (such; as null) are also assumed to be base pointers. In practice, this constraint; can be relaxed to producing interior derived pointers provided the target; collector can find the associated allocation from an arbitrary interior; derived pointer.

The look up rule here is:. * (1) When we import module M. The compiler would look up M.pcm in the directories specified; by ``-fprebuilt-module-path``.; * (2) When we import partition module unit M:P. The compiler would look up M-P.pcm in the; directories specified by ``-fprebuilt-module-path``. The option ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>`` tells the compiler to load the specified BMI directly.; The option ``-fmodule-file=<module-name>=<path/to/BMI>`` tells the compiler to load the specified BMI; for the module specified by ``<module-name>`` when necessary. The main difference is that; ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>`` will load the BMI eagerly, whereas; ``-fmodule-file=<module-name>=<path/to/BMI>`` will only load the BMI lazily, which is similar; with ``-fprebuilt-module-path``.

In case all ``-fprebuilt-module-path=<path/to/directory>``, ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>`` and; ``-fmodule-file=<module-name>=<path/to/BMI>`` exist, the ``-fmodule-file=<path/to/BMI>`` option; takes highest precedence and ``-fmodule-file=<module-name>=<path/to/BMI>`` will take the second; highest precedence.

Without this, it would be almost; impossible to eliminate any ``retain``/``release`` pairs. For; example, consider the following code:. .. code-block:: objc. id x = _ivar;; [x foo];. If we were not permitted in any event to shorten the lifetime of the; object in ``x``, then we would not be able to eliminate this retain; and release unless we could prove that the message send could not; modify ``_ivar`` (or deallocate ``self``). Since message sends are; opaque to the optimizer, this is not possible, and so ARC's hands; would be almost completely tied. ARC makes no guarantees about the execution of a computation history; which contains undefined behavior. In particular, ARC makes no; guarantees in the presence of race conditions.

This is an optimization made possible because fast enumeration loops promise; to keep the objects retained during enumeration, and the collection itself; cannot be synchronously modified. It can be overridden by explicitly; qualifying the variable with ``__strong``, which will make the variable; mutable again and cause the loop to retain the objects it encounters. .. _arc.misc.blocks:. Blocks; ------. The implicit ``const`` capture variables created when evaluating a block; literal expression have the same ownership semantics as the local variables; they capture.

The :ref:`inference <arc.ownership.inference>` rules apply equally to; ``__block`` variables, which is a shift in semantics from non-ARC, where; ``__block`` variables did not implicitly retain during capture. ``__block`` variables of retainable object owner type are moved off the stack; by initializing the heap copy with the result of moving from the stack copy. With the exception of retains done as part of initializing a ``__strong``; parameter variable or reading a ``__weak`` variable, whenever these semantics; call for retaining a value of block-pointer type, it has the effect of a; ``Block_copy``. The optimizer may remove such copies when it sees that the; result is used only as an argument to a call.

The remaining arguments are indices; that indicate which of the elements of the aggregate object are indexed.; The interpretation of each index is dependent on the type being indexed; into. The first index always indexes the pointer value given as the; second argument, the second index indexes a value of the type pointed to; (not necessarily the value directly pointed to, since the first index; can be non-zero), etc. The first type indexed into must be a pointer; value, subsequent types can be arrays, vectors, and structs. Note that; subsequent types being indexed into can never be pointers, since that; would require loading the pointer before continuing calculation. The type of each index argument depends on the type it is indexing into.; When indexing into a (optionally packed) structure, only ``i32`` integer; **constants** are allowed (when using a vector of indices they must all; be the **same** ``i32`` integer constant).

Custom Assertion Handlers. The analyzer exploits code assertions by pruning off paths where the; assertion condition is false. The idea is capture any program invariants; specified in the assertion that the developer may know but is not immediately; apparent in the code itself. In this way assertions make implicit assumptions; explicit in the code, which not only makes the analyzer more accurate when; finding bugs, but can help others better able to understand your code as well.; It can also help remove certain kinds of analyzer false positives by pruning off; false paths.; In order to exploit assertions, however, the analyzer must understand when it; encounters an ""assertion handler."" Typically assertions are; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler. For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where the assertion condition; failed.

Note that in cases where none of the atomic intrinsics are used, this; model places only one restriction on IR transformations on top of what; is required for single-threaded execution: introducing a store to a byte; which might not otherwise be stored is not allowed in general.; (Specifically, in the case where another thread might write to and read; from an address, introducing a store can change a load that may see; exactly one write into a load that may see multiple writes.). .. _ordering:.

The command to do the extraction is:. .. code-block:: shell. ./bin/llvm-extract -o - -S -b ‘foo:bb1;bb4’ <input> > extracted.ll. This particular example extracts two basic blocks from a function named ``foo``.; The new LLVM-IR can then be modified to add the ``failedISel`` attribute to the; extracted function containing bb4 to make that function use SelectionDAG. This can prevent some optimizations as GlobalISel is generally able to work on a; single function at a time. This technique can be repeated for different; combinations of basic blocks until you have identified the critical blocks; involved in a bug. Once the critical blocks have been identified, you can further increase the; resolution to the critical instructions by splitting the blocks like from:. .. code-block:: none. bb1:; ... instructions group 1 ...; ... instructions group 2 ... into:. .. code-block:: none. bb1:; ... instructions group 1 ...; br %bb2. bb2:; ... instructions group 2 ... and then repeating the process for the new blocks. It's also possible to use this technique in a mode where the main function; is compiled with GlobalISel and the extracted basic blocks are compiled with; SelectionDAG (or the other way around) to leverage the existing quality of; another code generator to track down bugs.

(Equivalent to ``-fmodule-map-file=<resource dir>/include/module.modulemap``). ``-fimplicit-module-maps``; Enable implicit search for module map files named ``module.modulemap`` and similar. This option is implied by ``-fmodules``. If this is disabled with ``-fno-implicit-module-maps``, module map files will only be loaded if they are explicitly specified via ``-fmodule-map-file`` or transitively used by another module map file. ``-fmodules-cache-path=<directory>``; Specify the path to the modules cache. If not provided, Clang will select a system-appropriate default. ``-fno-autolink``; Disable automatic linking against the libraries associated with imported modules. ``-fmodules-ignore-macro=macroname``; Instruct modules to ignore the named macro when selecting an appropriate module variant. Use this for macros defined on the command line that don't affect how modules are built, to improve sharing of compiled module files. ``-fmodules-prune-interval=seconds``; Specify the minimum delay (in seconds) between attempts to prune the module cache. Module cache pruning attempts to clear out old, unused module files so that the module cache itself does not grow without bound. The default delay is large (604,800 seconds, or 7 days) because this is an expensive operation.

Performance,"f the successors, we forward the edge; from the predecessor to the successor by duplicating the contents of this; block. An example of when this can occur is code like this:. .. code-block:: c++. if () { ...; X = 4;; }; if (X < 3) {. In this case, the unconditional branch at the end of the first if can be; revectored to the false side of the second if. .. _passes-lcssa:. ``lcssa``: Loop-Closed SSA Form Pass; ------------------------------------. This pass transforms loops by placing phi nodes at the end of the loops for all; values that are live across the loop boundary. For example, it turns the left; into the right code:. .. code-block:: c++. for (...) for (...); if (c) if (c); X1 = ... X1 = ...; else else; X2 = ... X2 = ...; X3 = phi(X1, X2) X3 = phi(X1, X2); ... = X3 + 4 X4 = phi(X3); ... = X4 + 4. This is still valid LLVM; the extra phi nodes are purely redundant, and will be; trivially eliminated by ``InstCombine``. The major benefit of this; transformation is that it makes many other loop optimizations, such as; ``LoopUnswitch``\ ing, simpler. You can read more in the; :ref:`loop terminology section for the LCSSA form <loop-terminology-lcssa>`. .. _passes-licm:. ``licm``: Loop Invariant Code Motion; ------------------------------------. This pass performs loop invariant code motion, attempting to remove as much; code from the body of a loop as possible. It does this by either hoisting code; into the preheader block, or by sinking code to the exit blocks if it is safe.; This pass also promotes must-aliased memory locations in the loop to live in; registers, thus hoisting and sinking ""invariant"" loads and stores. Hoisting operations out of loops is a canonicalization transform. It enables; and simplifies subsequent optimizations in the middle-end. Rematerialization; of hoisted instructions to reduce register pressure is the responsibility of; the back-end, which has more accurate information about register pressure and; also handles other optimizations than LICM",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Passes.rst:23238,optimiz,optimizations,23238,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Passes.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Passes.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']

Note that this definition of *""based""* is intentionally similar to the; definition of *""based""* in C99, though it is slightly weaker. LLVM IR does not associate types with memory. The result type of a; ``load`` merely indicates the size and alignment of the memory from; which to load, as well as the interpretation of the value.

Performance,"f:`code generation plugins <plugin>` - to; generate code and data structures which conforms to the *binary interface*; specified by the *runtime library*. This is similar to the relationship between; LLVM and DWARF debugging info, for example. The difference primarily lies in; the lack of an established standard in the domain of garbage collection --- thus; the need for a flexible extension mechanism. The aspects of the binary interface with which LLVM's GC support is; concerned are:. * Creation of GC safepoints within code where collection is allowed to execute; safely. * Computation of the stack map. For each safe point in the code, object; references within the stack frame must be identified so that the collector may; traverse and perhaps update them. * Write barriers when storing object references to the heap. These are commonly; used to optimize incremental scans in generational collectors. * Emission of read barriers when loading object references. These are useful; for interoperating with concurrent collectors. There are additional areas that LLVM does not directly address:. * Registration of global roots with the runtime. * Registration of stack map entries with the runtime. * The functions used by the program to allocate memory, trigger a collection,; etc. * Computation or compilation of type maps, or registration of them with the; runtime. These are used to crawl the heap for object references. In general, LLVM's support for GC does not include features which can be; adequately addressed with other features of the IR and does not specify a; particular binary interface.

This approach of using a tentative scratch V# and shifting the register; numbers if used avoids having to perform register allocation a second; time if the tentative V# is eliminated. This is more efficient and; avoids the problem that the second register allocation may perform; spilling which will fail as there is no longer a scratch V#.

This section describes the LLVM Transform Passes. ``adce``: Aggressive Dead Code Elimination; ------------------------------------------. ADCE aggressively tries to eliminate code. This pass is similar to :ref:`DCE; <passes-dce>` but it assumes that values are dead until proven otherwise. This; is similar to :ref:`SCCP <passes-sccp>`, except applied to the liveness of; values. ``always-inline``: Inliner for ``always_inline`` functions; ----------------------------------------------------------. A custom inliner that handles only functions that are marked as ""always; inline"". ``argpromotion``: Promote 'by reference' arguments to scalars; -------------------------------------------------------------. This pass promotes ""by reference"" arguments to be ""by value"" arguments. In; practice, this means looking for internal functions that have pointer; arguments. If it can prove, through the use of alias analysis, that an; argument is *only* loaded, then it can pass the value into the function instead; of the address of the value. This can cause recursive simplification of code; and lead to the elimination of allocas (especially in C++ template code like; the STL). This pass also handles aggregate arguments that are passed into a function,; scalarizing them if the elements of the aggregate are only loaded. Note that; it refuses to scalarize aggregates which would require passing in more than; three operands to the function, because passing thousands of operands for a; large array or structure is unprofitable!. Note that this transformation could also be done for arguments that are only; stored to (returning the value instead), but does not currently. This case; would be best handled when and if LLVM starts supporting multiple return values; from functions. ``block-placement``: Profile Guided Basic Block Placement; ---------------------------------------------------------.

Care must be taken to update ``llvm.dbg.value`` intrinsics when optimization; passes alter or move instructions and blocks -- the developer could observe such; changes reflected in the value of variables when debugging the program. For any; execution of the optimized program, the set of variable values presented to the; developer by the debugger should not show a state that would never have existed; in the execution of the unoptimized program, given the same input. Doing so; risks misleading the developer by reporting a state that does not exist,; damaging their understanding of the optimized program and undermining their; trust in the debugger.

Performance,"filing tests are very limited, and generating the profile takes a; significant amount of time, but it can result in a significant improvement in; the performance of the generated binaries. In addition to PGO profiling we also have limited support in-tree for generating; linker order files. These files provide the linker with a suggested ordering for; functions in the final binary layout. This can measurably speed up clang by; physically grouping functions that are called temporally close to each other.; The current tooling is only available on Darwin systems with ``dtrace(1)``. It; is worth noting that dtrace is non-deterministic, and so the order file; generation using dtrace is also non-deterministic. Options for Reducing Size; =========================. .. warning::; Any steps taken to reduce the binary size will come at a cost of runtime; performance in the generated binaries. The simplest and least significant way to reduce binary size is to set the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* variable to ``MinSizeRel``, which will set the compiler; optimization level to ``-Os`` which optimizes for binary size. This will have; both the least benefit to size and the least impact on performance. The most impactful way to reduce binary size is to dynamically link LLVM into; all the tools. This reduces code size by decreasing duplication of common code; between the LLVM-based tools. This can be done by setting the following two; CMake options to ``On``: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* and *LLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB*. .. warning::; Distributions should never be built using the *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake; option.

In particular, when resolving global variables and function; declarations which are not part of the ROOT PCH.; * Enhanced symbol resolution mechanisms, bloom filters -- standard ROOT relies; on information in ROOTMAP files to react when the llvm JIT issues an; unresolved symbol callback. C++ Modules-aware ROOT relies on a behavior much; closer to the standard linker behavior. In particular, we start searching on; the LD_LIBRARY_PATH descending to the system libraries. The algorithm is very; efficient because it uses bloom filters[[5]]. This in turn allows ROOT symbol; to be extended to system libraries. ### Module Registration Approaches. The C++ modules system supports /*preloading*/ of all modules at startup time.; The current implementation of loading of C++ modules in clang has an overhead; and is between 40-60 MB depending on the ROOT configuration while there might; be 2x slowdown depending on the workflow. These issues are very likely to be; addressed by the LLVM community in midterm. Preloading of all C++ modules is semantically the closest to C++ behavior.; However, in order to achieve performance ROOT loads them on demand using; a global module index file. It has sufficient information to map a looked up; identifier to the module which contains the corresponding definition. Switching; back to preloading of all C++ modules is done by setting the `ROOT_USE_GMI`; environment variable to false.; ; ### Supported Platforms.

Performance,"for each vector lane, and is used to prevent memory accesses to the masked-off lanes. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first operand is the vector value to be written to memory. The second operand is the base pointer for the store, it has the same underlying type as the value operand. The third operand is the alignment of the destination location. It must be a power of two constant integer value. The fourth operand, mask, is a vector of boolean values. The types of the mask and the value operand must have the same number of vector elements. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.masked.store``' intrinsics is designed for conditional writing of selected vector elements in a single IR operation. It is useful for targets that support vector masked store and allows vectorizing predicated basic blocks on these targets. Other targets may support this intrinsic differently, for example by lowering it into a sequence of branches that guard scalar store operations.; The result of this operation is equivalent to a load-modify-store sequence. However, using this intrinsic prevents exceptions and data races on memory access to masked-off lanes. ::. call void @llvm.masked.store.v16f32.p0(<16 x float> %value, ptr %ptr, i32 4, <16 x i1> %mask). ;; The result of the following instructions is identical aside from potential data races and memory access exceptions; %oldval = load <16 x float>, ptr %ptr, align 4; %res = select <16 x i1> %mask, <16 x float> %value, <16 x float> %oldval; store <16 x float> %res, ptr %ptr, align 4. Masked Vector Gather and Scatter Intrinsics; -------------------------------------------. LLVM provides intrinsics for vector gather and scatter operations. They are similar to :ref:`Masked Vector Load and Store <int_mload_mstore>`, except they are designed for arbitrary memory accesses, rather than sequential memory accesses.

Performance,"for entering functions. ##### Use `lfence` to guard function transitions. An `lfence` instruction can be used to prevent subsequent loads from; speculatively executing until all prior mispredicted predicates have resolved.; We can use this broader barrier to speculative loads executing between; functions. We emit it in the entry block to handle calls, and prior to each; return. This approach also has the advantage of providing the strongest degree; of mitigation when mixed with unmitigated code by halting all misspeculation; entering a function which is mitigated, regardless of what occurred in the; caller. However, such a mixture is inherently more risky. Whether this kind of; mixture is a sufficient mitigation requires careful analysis. Unfortunately, experimental results indicate that the performance overhead of; this approach is very high for certain patterns of code. A classic example is; any form of recursive evaluation engine. The hot, rapid call and return; sequences exhibit dramatic performance loss when mitigated with `lfence`. This; component alone can regress performance by 2x or more, making it an unpleasant; tradeoff even when only used in a mixture of code. ##### Use an internal TLS location to pass predicate state. We can define a special thread-local value to hold the predicate state between; functions. This avoids direct ABI implications by using a side channel between; callers and callees to communicate the predicate state. It also allows implicit; zero-initialization of the state, which allows non-checked code to be the first; code executed. However, this requires a load from TLS in the entry block, a store to TLS; before every call and every ret, and a load from TLS after every call. As a; consequence it is expected to be substantially more expensive even than using; `%rsp` and potentially `lfence` within the function entry block. ##### Define a new ABI and/or calling convention.

The ROOT Linear algebra package is documented in a separate chapter (see; ""Linear Algebra in ROOT""). `SMatrix` is a C++ package, for high; performance vector and matrix computations. It has been introduced in; ROOT v5.08. It is optimized for describing small matrices and vectors; and It can be used only in problems when the size of the matrices is; known at compile time, like in the tracking reconstruction of physics; experiments. It is based on a C++ technique, called expression; templates, to achieve an high level optimization. The C++ templates can; be used to implement vector and matrix expressions such that these; expressions can be transformed at compile time to code which is; equivalent to hand optimized code in a low-level language like FORTRAN; or C (see for example T. Veldhuizen, Expression Templates, C++ Report,; 1995). The `SMatrix` has been developed initially by T. Glebe in; Max-Planck-Institut, Heidelberg, as part of the `HeraB` analysis; framework. A subset of the original package has been now incorporated in; the ROOT distribution, with the aim to provide a stand-alone and high; performance matrix package. The API of the current package differs from; the original one, in order to be compliant to the ROOT coding; conventions. `SMatrix` contains the generic **`ROOT::Math::SMatrix`** and; **`R",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:99154,optimiz,optimized,99154,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['optimiz'],['optimized']
Performance,"for specialized cases, where the outcome; of a condition is severely skewed. As a result, the optimizer can be extremely; aggressive, which can result in performance degradation if the outcome is less; predictable than the annotation suggests. Even when the annotation is correct; 90% of the time, it may be beneficial to either remove the annotation or to use; a different intrinsic that can communicate the probability more directly. Because this may be too strict, MisExpect diagnostics are not enabled by; default, and support an additional flag to tolerate some deviation from the; exact thresholds. The ``-fdiagnostic-misexpect-tolerance=N`` accepts; deviations when comparing branch weights within ``N%`` of the expected values.; So passing ``-fdiagnostic-misexpect-tolerance=5`` will not report diagnostic messages; if the branch weight from the profile is within 5% of the weight added by; the ``llvm.expect`` intrinsic. MisExpect diagnostics are also available in the form of optimization remarks,; which can be serialized and processed through the ``opt-viewer.py``; scripts in LLVM. .. option:: -Rpass=misexpect. Enables optimization remarks for misexpect when profiling data conflicts with; use of ``llvm.expect`` intrinsics. .. option:: -Wmisexpect. Enables misexpect warnings when profiling data conflicts with use of; ``llvm.expect`` intrinsics. .. option:: -fdiagnostic-misexpect-tolerance=N. Relaxes misexpect checking to tolerate profiling values within N% of the; expected branch weight. e.g., a value of ``N=5`` allows misexpect to check against; ``0.95 * Threshold``.

Performance,"form, internal libraries built as part of the software itself to provide structure, and third-party libraries. For each library, one needs to access both its interface (API) and its implementation. In the C family of languages, the interface to a library is accessed by including the appropriate header files(s):. .. code-block:: c. #include <SomeLib.h>. The implementation is handled separately by linking against the appropriate library. For example, by passing ``-lSomeLib`` to the linker. Modules provide an alternative, simpler way to use software libraries that provides better compile-time scalability and eliminates many of the problems inherent to using the C preprocessor to access the API of a library. Problems with the current model; -------------------------------; The ``#include`` mechanism provided by the C preprocessor is a very poor way to access the API of a library, for a number of reasons:. * **Compile-time scalability**: Each time a header is included, the; compiler must preprocess and parse the text in that header and every; header it includes, transitively. This process must be repeated for; every translation unit in the application, which involves a huge; amount of redundant work. In a project with *N* translation units; and *M* headers included in each translation unit, the compiler is; performing *M x N* work even though most of the *M* headers are; shared among multiple translation units. C++ is particularly bad,; because the compilation model for templates forces a huge amount of; code into headers. * **Fragility**: ``#include`` directives are treated as textual; inclusion by the preprocessor, and are therefore subject to any; active macro definitions at the time of inclusion. If any of the; active macro definitions happens to collide with a name in the; library, it can break the library API or cause compilation failures; in the library header itself.

In any case, please don't use it. .. _dss_bitvector:. BitVector; ^^^^^^^^^. The BitVector container provides a dynamic size set of bits for manipulation.; It supports individual bit setting/testing, as well as set operations. The set; operations take time O(size of bitvector), but operations are performed one word; at a time, instead of one bit at a time. This makes the BitVector very fast for; set operations compared to other containers. Use the BitVector when you expect; the number of set bits to be high (i.e. a dense set). .. _dss_smallbitvector:. SmallBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The SmallBitVector container provides the same interface as BitVector, but it is; optimized for the case where only a small number of bits, less than 25 or so,; are needed. It also transparently supports larger bit counts, but slightly less; efficiently than a plain BitVector, so SmallBitVector should only be used when; larger counts are rare. At this time, SmallBitVector does not support set operations (and, or, xor), and; its operator[] does not provide an assignable lvalue. .. _dss_sparsebitvector:. SparseBitVector; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The SparseBitVector container is much like BitVector, with one major difference:; Only the bits that are set, are stored. This makes the SparseBitVector much; more space efficient than BitVector when the set is sparse, as well as making; set operations O(number of set bits) instead of O(size of universe). The; downside to the SparseBitVector is that setting and testing of random bits is; O(N), and on large SparseBitVectors, this can be slower than BitVector.

The driver is required to program each; specified register to the corresponding specified value when; executing this pipeline. Typically, the ``reg offsets`` are the; ``uint16_t`` offsets to each register as defined by the hardware; chip headers. The register is set to the provided value. However, a; ``reg offset`` that specifies a user data register (e.g.,; COMPUTE_USER_DATA_0) needs special treatment.

Performance,"fsets. We implement this optimization on x86 by skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset. The result of this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it. Consider code like the; following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; movq (%rcx), %rdi; movl (%rdi), %edx; ```. This will get transformed into:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movq (%rcx), %rdi # Hardened load.; movl (%rdi), %edx # Unhardened load due to dependent addr.; ```.

It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exceed that of an `lfence` when *correctly* speculatively; executed. But in that case, the `lfence` cost is a complete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum).

Since it is an extension module, the usage of `PyROOT` probably comes; naturally if you're used to Python. In general, `PyROOT` attempts to; allow working in both Python and ROOT style, and although it is; succeeding, it isn't perfect: there are edges. The following sections; explain in some detail what you can expect, and what you need to watch; out for. #### Access to ROOT Classes. Before a ROOT class can be used from Python, its dictionary needs to be; loaded into the current process. Starting with ROOT version 4.00/06,; this happens automatically for all classes that are declared to the; auto-loading mechanism through so-called `rootmap` files. Effectively,; this means that all classes in the ROOT distributions are directly; available for import. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TCanvas # available at startup; c = TCanvas(). from ROOT import TLorentzVector # triggers auto-load of libPhysics; l = TLorentzVector(); ```. Although it is not recommended, a simple way of working with `PyROOT` is; doing a global import:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import *. c = TCanvas(); l = TLorentzVector(); ```. Keeping the ROOT namespace (""`import ROOT`""), or only importing from; ROOT those classes that you will actually use (see above), however, will; always be cleaner and clearer:. ``` {.cpp}; import ROOT. c = ROOT.TCanvas(); l = ROOT.TLorentzVector(); ```. Since it is foreseen that most people will use the simple approach; anyway, the request to copy all from module ROOT will not actually; result in copying all ROOT classes into the current namespace. Instead,; classes will still be bound (and possibly loaded) on an as-needed basis.; Note carefully how this is different from other Python (extension); modules, and what to expect if you use the normal inspection tools (such; as e.g. '`dir()`').

Performance,"ften require access to the *object pointer* rather than the *derived; pointer* (which is a pointer to the field within the object). Accordingly,; these intrinsics take both pointers as separate arguments for completeness. In; this snippet, ``%object`` is the object pointer, and ``%derived`` is the derived; pointer:. .. code-block:: llvm. ;; An array type.; %class.Array = type { %class.Object, i32, [0 x %class.Object*] }; ... ;; Load the object pointer from a gcroot.; %object = load %class.Array** %object_addr. ;; Compute the derived pointer.; %derived = getelementptr %object, i32 0, i32 2, i32 %n. LLVM does not enforce this relationship between the object and derived pointer; (although a particular :ref:`collector strategy <plugin>` might). However, it; would be an unusual collector that violated it. The use of these intrinsics is naturally optional if the target GC does not; require the corresponding barrier. The GC strategy used with such a collector; should replace the intrinsic calls with the corresponding ``load`` or; ``store`` instruction if they are used. One known deficiency with the current design is that the barrier intrinsics do; not include the size or alignment of the underlying operation performed. It is; currently assumed that the operation is of pointer size and the alignment is; assumed to be the target machine's default alignment.

Performance,"g a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it. Consider code like the; following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; movq (%rcx), %rdi; movl (%rdi), %edx; ```. This will get transformed into:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movq (%rcx), %rdi # Hardened load.; movl (%rdi), %edx # Unhardened load due to dependent addr.; ```. This doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence. It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require independent; protection *and* which require hardening the address of the load. However, this; is unlikely to be profitable in practice. The latency hit of the hardening; would need to exceed that of an `lfence` when *correctly* speculatively; executed. But in that case, the `lfence` cost is a complete loss of speculative; execution (at a minimum). So far, the evidence we have of the performance cost; of using `lfence` indicates few if any hot code patterns where this trade off; would make sense. ###### Tempting optimizations that break the security model.

Performance,"g information does not prevent optimizations from; happening (for example inlining, basic block reordering/merging/cleanup,; tail duplication, etc). * LLVM debug information is automatically optimized along with the rest of; the program, using existing facilities. For example, duplicate; information is automatically merged by the linker, and unused information; is automatically removed. Basically, the debug information allows you to compile a program with; ""``-O0 -g``"" and get full debug information, allowing you to arbitrarily modify; the program as it executes from a debugger. Compiling a program with; ""``-O3 -g``"" gives you full debug information that is always available and; accurate for reading (e.g., you get accurate stack traces despite tail call; elimination and inlining), but you might lose the ability to modify the program; and call functions which were optimized out of the program, or inlined away; completely. The :doc:`LLVM test-suite <TestSuiteMakefileGuide>` provides a framework to; test the optimizer's handling of debugging information. It can be run like; this:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd llvm/projects/test-suite/MultiSource/Benchmarks # or some other level; % make TEST=dbgopt.

The MisExpect checks in the LLVM backend follow a simple procedure: if there is; a mismatch between the branch weights collected during profiling and those; supplied by an ``llvm.expect`` intrinsic, then it will emit a diagnostic; message to the user. The most natural place to perform the verification is just prior to when; branch weights are assigned to the target instruction in the form of; branch weight metadata. There are 3 key places in the LLVM backend where branch weights are; created and assigned based on profiling information or the use of the; ``llvm.expect`` intrinsic, and our implementation focuses on these; places to perform the verification. We calculate the threshold for emitting MisExpect related diagnostics; based on the values the compiler assigns to ``llvm.expect`` intrinsics,; which can be set through the ``-likely-branch-weight`` and; ``-unlikely-branch-weight`` LLVM options. During verification, if the; profile weights mismatch the calculated threshold, then we will emit a; remark or warning detailing a potential performance regression. The; diagnostic also reports the percentage of the time the annotation was; correct during profiling to help developers reason about how to proceed. The diagnostics are also available in the form of optimization remarks,; which can be serialized and processed through the ``opt-viewer.py``; scripts in LLVM. .. option:: -pass-remarks=misexpect. Enables optimization remarks for misexpect when profiling data conflicts with; use of ``llvm.expect`` intrinsics. .. option:: -pgo-warn-misexpect.

For example:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TCanvas # available at startup; c = TCanvas(). from ROOT import TLorentzVector # triggers auto-load of libPhysics; l = TLorentzVector(); ```. Although it is not recommended, a simple way of working with `PyROOT` is; doing a global import:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import *. c = TCanvas(); l = TLorentzVector(); ```. Keeping the ROOT namespace (""`import ROOT`""), or only importing from; ROOT those classes that you will actually use (see above), however, will; always be cleaner and clearer:. ``` {.cpp}; import ROOT. c = ROOT.TCanvas(); l = ROOT.TLorentzVector(); ```. Since it is foreseen that most people will use the simple approach; anyway, the request to copy all from module ROOT will not actually; result in copying all ROOT classes into the current namespace. Instead,; classes will still be bound (and possibly loaded) on an as-needed basis.; Note carefully how this is different from other Python (extension); modules, and what to expect if you use the normal inspection tools (such; as e.g. '`dir()`'). This feature prevents the inspection tools from; being swamped by an enormous amount of classes, but they can no longer; be used to explore unknown parts of the system (e.g. to find out which; classes are available). Furthermore, because of this approach,; \<`tab`\>-completion will usually not be available until after the first; use (and hence creation) of a class.

Loop Distribution; -----------------. Loop Distribution allows splitting a loop into multiple loops. This is; beneficial for example when the entire loop cannot be vectorized but some of the; resulting loops can. If ``distribute(enable))`` is specified and the loop has memory dependencies; that inhibit vectorization, the compiler will attempt to isolate the offending; operations into a new loop. This optimization is not enabled by default, only; loops marked with the pragma are considered. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop distribute(enable); for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {; S1: A[i + 1] = A[i] + B[i];; S2: C[i] = D[i] * E[i];; }. This loop will be split into two loops between statements S1 and S2. The; second loop containing S2 will be vectorized. Loop Distribution is currently not enabled by default in the optimizer because; it can hurt performance in some cases. For example, instruction-level; parallelism could be reduced by sequentializing the execution of the; statements S1 and S2 above. If Loop Distribution is turned on globally with; ``-mllvm -enable-loop-distribution``, specifying ``distribute(disable)`` can; be used the disable it on a per-loop basis.

For convenience multiple loop hints can be specified on a single line. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma clang loop vectorize_width(4) interleave_count(8); for(...) {; ...; }. If an optimization cannot be applied any hints that apply to it will be ignored.; For example, the hint ``vectorize_width(4)`` is ignored if the loop is not; proven safe to vectorize.

The static; analysis engine used by the Clang Static Analyzer is a Clang library, and has; the capability to be reused in different contexts and by different clients.; Important Points to Consider; While we believe that the static analyzer is already very useful for finding; bugs, we ask you to bear in mind a few points when using it.; Work-in-Progress; The analyzer is a continuous work-in-progress. There are many planned; enhancements to improve both the precision and scope of its analysis algorithms; as well as the kinds of bugs it will find. While there are fundamental; limitations to what static analysis can do, we have a long way to go before; hitting that wall.; Slower than Compilation; Operationally, using static analysis to; automatically find deep program bugs is about trading CPU time for the hardening; of code. Because of the deep analysis performed by state-of-the-art static; analysis tools, static analysis can be much slower than compilation.; While the Clang Static Analyzer is being designed to be as fast and; light-weight as possible, please do not expect it to be as fast as compiling a; program (even with optimizations enabled). Some of the algorithms needed to find; bugs require in the worst case exponential time.; The Clang Static Analyzer runs in a reasonable amount of time by both; bounding the amount of checking work it will do as well as using clever; algorithms to reduce the amount of work it must do to find bugs.; False Positives; Static analysis is not perfect. It can falsely flag bugs in a program where; the code behaves correctly. Because some code checks require more analysis; precision than others, the frequency of false positives can vary widely between; different checks. Our long-term goal is to have the analyzer have a low false; positive rate for most code on all checks.; Please help us in this endeavor by reporting false; positives.

Additionally, we would like; to be able to statically eliminate many bounds checks in Java; programs... for example. 2. Instead, we can do the following (eventually): ; * Java bytecode is used as our ""safe"" representation (to avoid; reinventing something that we don't add much value to). When the; user chooses to execute Java bytecodes directly (ie, not; precompiled) the runtime compiler can do some very simple; transformations (JIT style) to convert it into valid input for our; VM. Performance is not wonderful, but it works right.; * The file is scheduled to be compiled (rigorously) at a later; time. This could be done by some background process or by a second; processor in the system during idle time or something...; * To keep things ""safe"" ie to enforce a sandbox on Java/foreign code,; we could sign the generated VM code with a host specific private; key. Then before the code is executed/loaded, we can check to see if; the trusted compiler generated the code. This would be much quicker; than having to validate consistency (especially if bounds checks have; been removed, for example). > This is important because the audiences for these two goals are very; > different. Architects and many compiler people care much more about; > the second question. The Java compiler and OS community care much more; > about the first one. 3.

Performance,"ge, which wraps the; ObjectFile class, is a helper class which parses the binary object image; and provides access to the information contained in the format-specific; headers, including section, symbol and relocation information. RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject then iterates through the symbols in the; image. Information about common symbols is collected for later use. For; each function or data symbol, the associated section is loaded into memory; and the symbol is stored in a symbol table map data structure. When the; iteration is complete, a section is emitted for the common symbols. Next, RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject iterates through the sections in the; object image and for each section iterates through the relocations for; that sections. For each relocation, it calls the format-specific; processRelocationRef method, which will examine the relocation and store; it in one of two data structures, a section-based relocation list map and; an external symbol relocation map. .. image:: MCJIT-load-object.png. When RuntimeDyldImpl::loadObject returns, all of the code and data; sections for the object will have been loaded into memory allocated by the; memory manager and relocation information will have been prepared, but the; relocations have not yet been applied and the generated code is still not; ready to be executed. [Currently (as of August 2013) the MCJIT engine will immediately apply; relocations when loadObject completes. However, this shouldn't be; happening. Because the code may have been generated for a remote target,; the client should be given a chance to re-map the section addresses before; relocations are applied. It is possible to apply relocations multiple; times, but in the case where addresses are to be re-mapped, this first; application is wasted effort.]. Address Remapping; =================.

Options are boolean; variables, with possible values ON/OFF. Options and variables are defined on the; CMake command line like this:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -DVARIABLE=value path/to/llvm/source. You can set a variable after the initial CMake invocation to change its; value. You can also undefine a variable:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -UVARIABLE path/to/llvm/source. Variables are stored in the CMake cache. This is a file named ``CMakeCache.txt``; stored at the root of your build directory that is generated by ``cmake``.; Editing it yourself is not recommended. Variables are listed in the CMake cache and later in this document with; the variable name and type separated by a colon. You can also specify the; variable and type on the CMake command line:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -DVARIABLE:TYPE=value path/to/llvm/source.

EXIT STATUS; -----------. :program:`llvm-mca` returns 0 on success. Otherwise, an error message is printed; to standard error, and the tool returns 1. USING MARKERS TO ANALYZE SPECIFIC CODE BLOCKS; ---------------------------------------------; :program:`llvm-mca` allows for the optional usage of special code comments to; mark regions of the assembly code to be analyzed. A comment starting with; substring ``LLVM-MCA-BEGIN`` marks the beginning of an analysis region. A; comment starting with substring ``LLVM-MCA-END`` marks the end of a region.; For example:. .. code-block:: none. # LLVM-MCA-BEGIN; ...; # LLVM-MCA-END. If no user-defined region is specified, then :program:`llvm-mca` assumes a; default region which contains every instruction in the input file. Every region; is analyzed in isolation, and the final performance report is the union of all; the reports generated for every analysis region. Analysis regions can have names. For example:. .. code-block:: none. # LLVM-MCA-BEGIN A simple example; add %eax, %eax; # LLVM-MCA-END. The code from the example above defines a region named ""A simple example"" with a; single instruction in it. Note how the region name doesn't have to be repeated; in the ``LLVM-MCA-END`` directive. In the absence of overlapping regions,; an anonymous ``LLVM-MCA-END`` directive always ends the currently active user; defined region. Example of nesting regions:. .. code-block:: none. # LLVM-MCA-BEGIN foo; add %eax, %edx; # LLVM-MCA-BEGIN bar; sub %eax, %edx; # LLVM-MCA-END bar; # LLVM-MCA-END foo.

This option is currently experimental. .. _cfi-canonical-jump-tables:. ``-fsanitize-cfi-canonical-jump-tables``; ----------------------------------------. The default behavior of Clang's indirect function call checker will replace; the address of each CFI-checked function in the output file's symbol table; with the address of a jump table entry which will pass CFI checks. We refer; to this as making the jump table `canonical`. This property allows code that; was not compiled with ``-fsanitize=cfi-icall`` to take a CFI-valid address; of a function, but it comes with a couple of caveats that are especially; relevant for users of cross-DSO CFI:. - There is a performance and code size overhead associated with each; exported function, because each such function must have an associated; jump table entry, which must be emitted even in the common case where the; function is never address-taken anywhere in the program, and must be used; even for direct calls between DSOs, in addition to the PLT overhead. - There is no good way to take a CFI-valid address of a function written in; assembly or a language not supported by Clang. The reason is that the code; generator would need to insert a jump table in order to form a CFI-valid; address for assembly functions, but there is no way in general for the; code generator to determine the language of the function. This may be; possible with LTO in the intra-DSO case, but in the cross-DSO case the only; information available is the function declaration. One possible solution; is to add a C wrapper for each assembly function, but these wrappers can; present a significant maintenance burden for heavy users of assembly in; addition to adding runtime overhead.

As a result, the further your IR gets from; what Clang might emit, the less likely it is to be effectively optimized. It; can often be useful to write a quick C program with the semantics you're trying; to model and see what decisions Clang's IRGen makes about what IR to emit.; Studying Clang's CodeGen directory can also be a good source of ideas. Note; that Clang and LLVM are explicitly version locked so you'll need to make sure; you're using a Clang built from the same git revision or release as the LLVM; library you're using. As always, it's *strongly* recommended that you track; tip of tree development, particularly during bring up of a new project. The Basics; ^^^^^^^^^^^. #. Make sure that your Modules contain both a data layout specification and; target triple. Without these pieces, non of the target specific optimization; will be enabled. This can have a major effect on the generated code quality. #. For each function or global emitted, use the most private linkage type; possible (private, internal or linkonce_odr preferably). Doing so will; make LLVM's inter-procedural optimizations much more effective. #. Avoid high in-degree basic blocks (e.g. basic blocks with dozens or hundreds; of predecessors). Among other issues, the register allocator is known to; perform badly with confronted with such structures. The only exception to; this guidance is that a unified return block with high in-degree is fine. Use of allocas; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

The; `AliasSetTracker <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1AliasSetTracker.html>`__; class is used to efficiently build these Alias Sets from the pairwise alias; analysis information provided by the ``AliasAnalysis`` interface. First you initialize the AliasSetTracker by using the ""``add``"" methods to add; information about various potentially aliasing instructions in the scope you are; interested in. Once all of the alias sets are completed, your pass should; simply iterate through the constructed alias sets, using the ``AliasSetTracker``; ``begin()``/``end()`` methods.

Remark streamers; ================. The ``RemarkStreamer`` interface is used to unify the serialization; capabilities of remarks across all the components that can generate remarks. All remark serialization should go through the main remark streamer, the; ``llvm::remarks::RemarkStreamer`` set up in the ``LLVMContext``. The interface; takes remark objects converted to ``llvm::remarks::Remark``, and takes care of; serializing it to the requested format, using the requested type of metadata,; etc. Typically, a specialized remark streamer will hold a reference to the one set; up in the ``LLVMContext``, and will operate on its own type of diagnostics. For example, LLVM IR passes will emit ``llvm::DiagnosticInfoOptimization*``; that get converted to ``llvm::remarks::Remark`` objects. Then, clang could set; up its own specialized remark streamer that takes ``clang::Diagnostic``; objects. This can allow various components of the frontend to emit remarks; using the same techniques as the LLVM remarks. This gives us the following advantages:. * Composition: during the compilation pipeline, multiple components can set up; their specialized remark streamers that all emit remarks through the same; main streamer.; * Re-using the remark infrastructure in ``lib/Remarks``.; * Using the same file and format for the remark emitters created throughout the; compilation. at the cost of an extra layer of abstraction. ..

For example, consider this; code:. .. code-block:: c++. __attribute__((visibility(""default""))); struct A {; virtual void f();; };. __attribute__((visibility(""hidden""))); struct B : A {; virtual void f();; };. With LTO, we know that all code which can see the declaration of ``B`` is; visible to us. However, a pointer to a ``B`` could be cast to ``A*`` and passed; to another linkage unit, which could then call ``f`` on it. This call would; load from the vtable for ``B`` (using the object pointer), and then call; ``B::f``. This means we can't remove the function pointer from ``B``'s vtable,; or the implementation of ``B::f``. However, if we can see all code which knows; about any dynamic base class (which would be the case if ``B`` only inherited; from classes with hidden visibility), then this optimisation would be valid.

In practice, however, the; locality and performance benefits of using aggressive garbage collection; techniques dominates any low-level losses. This document describes the mechanisms and interfaces provided by LLVM to; support accurate garbage collection. Goals and non-goals; -------------------. LLVM's intermediate representation provides :ref:`garbage collection intrinsics; <gc_intrinsics>` that offer support for a broad class of collector models. For; instance, the intrinsics permit:. * semi-space collectors. * mark-sweep collectors. * generational collectors. * incremental collectors. * concurrent collectors. * cooperative collectors. * reference counting. We hope that the support built into the LLVM IR is sufficient to support a; broad class of garbage collected languages including Scheme, ML, Java, C#,; Perl, Python, Lua, Ruby, other scripting languages, and more. Note that LLVM **does not itself provide a garbage collector** --- this should; be part of your language's runtime library. LLVM provides a framework for; describing the garbage collectors",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GarbageCollection.rst:4776,perform,performance,4776,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GarbageCollection.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GarbageCollection.rst,1,['perform'],['performance']

Global Variables; ----------------. Global variables define regions of memory allocated at compilation time; instead of run-time. Global variable definitions must be initialized. Global variables in other translation units can also be declared, in which; case they don't have an initializer. Global variables can optionally specify a :ref:`linkage type <linkage>`. Either global variable definitions or declarations may have an explicit section; to be placed in and may have an optional explicit alignment specified. If there; is a mismatch between the explicit or inferred section information for the; variable declaration and its definition the resulting behavior is undefined. A variable may be defined as a global ``constant``, which indicates that; the contents of the variable will **never** be modified (enabling better; optimization, allowing the global data to be placed in the read-only; section of an executable, etc). Note that variables that need runtime; initialization cannot be marked ``constant`` as there is a store to the; variable. LLVM explicitly allows *declarations* of global variables to be marked; constant, even if the final definition of the global is not. This; capability can be used to enable slightly better optimization of the; program, but requires the language definition to guarantee that; optimizations based on the 'constantness' are valid for the translation; units that do not include the definition. As SSA values, global variables define pointer values that are in scope; (i.e. they dominate) all basic blocks in the program. Global variables; always define a pointer to their ""content"" type because they describe a; region of memory, and all memory objects in LLVM are accessed through; pointers.

Forward-Edge CFI for Virtual Calls; ==================================. This scheme checks that virtual calls take place using a vptr of the correct; dynamic type; that is, the dynamic type of the called object must be a; derived class of the static type of the object used to make the call.; This CFI scheme can be enabled on its own using ``-fsanitize=cfi-vcall``. For this scheme to work, all translation units containing the definition; of a virtual member function (whether inline or not), other than members; of :ref:`ignored <cfi-ignorelist>` types or types with public :doc:`LTO; visibility <LTOVisibility>`, must be compiled with ``-flto`` or ``-flto=thin``; enabled and be statically linked into the program.

Another good performance benchmark for this mechanism is the; virtual-call-heavy SPEC 2006 xalancbmk. Note that this scheme has not yet been optimized for binary size; an increase; of up to 15% has been observed for Chromium. Bad Cast Checking; =================. This scheme checks that pointer casts are made to an object of the correct; dynamic type; that is, the dynamic type of the object must be a derived class; of the pointee type of the cast. The checks are currently only introduced; where the class being casted to is a polymorphic class. Bad casts are not in themselves control flow integrity violations, but they; can also create security vulnerabilities, and the implementation uses many; of the same mechanisms. There are two types of bad cast that may be forbidden: bad casts; from a base class to a derived class (which can be checked with; ``-fsanitize=cfi-derived-cast``), and bad casts from a pointer",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.rst:4798,perform,performance,4798,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.rst,1,['perform'],['performance']

The second argument `""/MyFolder"" `is the top folder, and the ""/"" signals; the **`TTree`** constructor that this is a folder not just the title.; You fill the tree by placing the data into the folder structure and; calling `TTree::Fill`. ### Tree and TRef Objects. ``` {.cpp}; MyTree->BranchRef();; ```. This call requests the construction of an optional branch supporting; table of references (**`TRefTable`**). This branch (**`TBranchRef`**); will keep all the information needed to find the branches containing; referenced objects at each `Tree::Fill`, the branch numbers containing; the referenced objects are saved in the table of references. When the; Tree header is saved (via `TTree::Write` for example), the branch is; saved, keeping the information with the pointers to the branches having; referenced objects. Enabling this optional table, allow; `TTree::Draw` to automatically load the branches needed to; dereference a **`TRef`** (or **`TRefArray`**) object. ### Autosave. `Autosave` gives the option to save all branch buffers every `n` byte.; We recommend using `Autosave` for large acquisitions. If the acquisition; fails to complete, you can recover the file and all the contents since; the last `Autosave`. To set the number of bytes between `Autosave` you; can use the `TTree::SetAutosave()` method. You can also call; **`TTree::Autosave` in the acquisition loop every `n `entry.**. ### Trees with Circular Buffers. When a **`TTree`** is memory resident, you set it up so that it retains; retain only the last few entries. For example, this can be very useful; for monitoring purpose. ``` {.cpp}; void TTree::SetCircular(Long64_t maxEntries);; ```. where `maxEntries` is the maximum number of entries to be kept in the; buffers. When the number of entries exceeds this value, the first; entries in the **`Tree`** are deleted and the buffers used again.

Performance,"h can be used at link; time. Link Time Optimization (LTO) is another name for intermodular; optimization when performed during the link stage. This document describes the; interface and design between the LTO optimizer and the linker. Design Philosophy; =================. The LLVM Link Time Optimizer provides complete transparency, while doing; intermodular optimization, in the compiler tool chain. Its main goal is to let; the developer take advantage of intermodular optimizations without making any; significant changes to the developer's makefiles or build system. This is; achieved through tight integration with the linker. In this model, the linker; treats LLVM bitcode files like native object files and allows mixing and; matching among them. The linker uses `libLTO`_, a shared object, to handle LLVM; bitcode files. This tight integration between the linker and LLVM optimizer; helps to do optimizations that are not possible in other models. The linker; input allows the optimizer to avoid relying on conservative escape analysis. .. _libLTO-example:. Example of link time optimization; ---------------------------------. The following example illustrates the advantages of LTO's integrated approach; and clean interface. This example requires a system linker which supports LTO; through the interface described in this document. Here, clang transparently; invokes system linker. * Input source file ``a.c`` is compiled into LLVM bitcode form.; * Input source file ``main.c`` is compiled into native object code. .. code-block:: c++. --- a.h ---; extern int foo1(void);; extern void foo2(void);; extern void foo4(void);. --- a.c ---; #include ""a.h"". static signed int i = 0;. void foo2(void) {; i = -1;; }. static int foo3() {; foo4();; return 10;; }. int foo1(void) {; int data = 0;. if (i < 0); data = foo3();. data = data + 42;; return data;; }. --- main.c ---; #include <stdio.h>; #include ""a.h"". void foo4(void) {; printf(""Hi\n"");; }. int main() {; return foo1();; }.

Performance,"h is also very fast and uses; only three words for its state. ### gEnv. **`gEnv`** is the global variable (of type **`TEnv`**) with all the; environment settings for the current session. This variable is set by; reading the contents of a `.rootrc` file (or; `$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc`) at the beginning of the root session.; See Environment Setup below for more information. ## Environment Setup. The behavior of a ROOT session can be tailored with the options in the; .`rootrc` file. At start-up, ROOT looks for a .`rootrc` file in the; following order:. - `./.rootrc` *`//local directory`*. - `$HOME/.rootrc ` *`//user directory`*. - `$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc ` *`//global ROOT directory`*. If more than one `.rootrc` files are found in the search paths above,; the options are merged, with precedence local, user, global. While in; a session, to see current settings, you can do:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gEnv->Print(); ```. The `rootrc` file typically looks like:. ```; # Path used by dynamic loader to find shared libraries; Unix.*.Root.DynamicPath: .:~/rootlibs:$(ROOTSYS)/lib; Unix.*.Root.MacroPath: .:~/rootmacros:$(ROOTSYS)/macros. # Path where to look for TrueType fonts; Unix.*.Root.UseTTFonts: true; Unix.*.Root.TTFontPath:; ...; # Activate memory statistics; Rint.Load: rootalias.C; Rint.Logon: rootlogon.C; Rint.Logoff: rootlogoff.C; ...; Rint.Canvas.MoveOpaque: false; Rint.Canvas.HighLightColor: 5; ```. The various options are explained in `$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc`. The; `.rootrc` file contents are combined. For example, if the flag to use; true type fonts is set to true in the `system.rootrc` file, you have; to set explicitly it false in your local `.rootrc` file if you do not; want to use true type fonts. Removing the `UseTTFonts `statement in; the local `.rootrc` file will not disable true fonts. The value of the; environment variable `ROOTDEBUG` overrides the value in the `.rootrc`; file at startup.

However, it can; also undermine strict floating-point reproducibility. Under the standards, assignments and explicit casts force the operand to be; converted to its formal type, discarding any excess precision. Because data; can only flow between statements via an assignment, this means that the use; of excess precision arithmetic is a reliable local property of a single; statement, and results do not change based on optimization. However, when; excess precision arithmetic is in use, Clang does not guarantee strict; reproducibility, and future compiler releases may recognize more; opportunities to use excess precision arithmetic, e.g. with floating-point; builtins. Clang does not use excess precision arithmetic for most types or on most; targets. For example, even on pre-SSE X86 targets where ``float`` and; ``double`` computations must be performed in the 80-bit X87 format, Clang; rounds all intermediate results correctly for their type.

Performance,"h previously recommended; approaches such as the `lfence` instruction. Just as users can restrict the; scope of `lfence` to control its performance impact, this mitigation technique; could be restricted in scope as well.

Here we assume targeting a Haswell (or newer) processor and; using all of the tricks to improve performance (so leaves the low 2gb; unprotected and +/- 2gb surrounding any PC in the program). We ran both; Google's microbenchmark suite and a large highly-tuned server built using; ThinLTO and PGO. All were built with `-march=haswell` to give access to BMI2; instructions, and benchmarks were run on large Haswell servers. We collected; data both with an `lfence`-based mitigation and load hardening as presented; here. The summary is that mitigating with load hardening is 1.77x faster than; mitigating with `lfence`, and the overhead of load hardening compared to a; normal program is likely between a 10% overhead and a 50% overhead with most; large applications seeing a 30% overhead or less. | Benchmark | `lfence` | Load Hardening | Mitigated Speedup |; | -------------------------------------- | -------: | -------------: | ----------------: |; | Google microbenchmark suite | -74.8% | -36.4% | **2.5x** |; | Large server QPS (using ThinLTO & PGO) | -62% | -29% | **1.8x** |.

Performance,"h prohibitive; performance cost.; 1. Loads may not target a general purpose register requiring extra instructions; to map the state value into the correct register class, and potentially more; expensive instructions to mask the value in some way.; 1. The flags registers on x86 are very likely to be live, and challenging to; preserve cheaply.; 1. There are many more values loaded than pointers & indices used for loads. As; a consequence, hardening the result of a load requires substantially more; instructions than hardening the address of the load (see below). Despite these challenges, hardening the result of the load critically allows; the load to proceed and thus has dramatically less impact on the total; speculative / out-of-order potential of the execution. There are also several; interesting techniques to try and mitigate these challenges and make hardening; the results of loads viable in at least some cases. However, we generally; expect to fall back when unprofitable from hardening the loaded value to the; next approach of hardening the address itself. ###### Loads folded into data-invariant operations can be hardened after the operation. The first key to making this feasible is to recognize that many operations on; x86 are ""data-invariant"". That is, they have no (known) observable behavior; differences due to the particular input data. These instructions are often used; when implementing cryptographic primitives dealing with private key data; because they are not believed to provide any side-channels.

The aarch64 implementation is considered production ready, and; an `implementation of the runtime`_ has been added to Android's libc; (bionic). An x86_64 implementation was evaluated using Chromium and was found; to have critical performance and security deficiencies--it was removed in; LLVM 9.0.

Performance,"han `(1 << 31) + 9`. The OS may wish; to protect an extra page of the low address space to account for this. ##### Optimizations. A very large portion of the cost for this approach comes from checking loads in; this way, so it is important to work to optimize this. However, beyond making; the instruction sequences to *apply* the checks efficient (for example by; avoiding `pushfq` and `popfq` sequences), the only significant optimization is; to check fewer loads without introducing a vulnerability. We apply several; techniques to accomplish that. ###### Don't check loads from compile-time constant stack offsets. We implement this optimization on x86 by skipping the checking of loads which; use a fixed frame pointer offset. The result of this optimization is that patterns like reloading a spilled; register or accessing a global field don't get checked. This is a very; significant performance win. ###### Don't check dependent loads. A core part of why this mitigation strategy works is that it establishes a; data-flow check on the loaded address. However, this means that if the address; itself was already loaded using a checked load, there is no need to check a; dependent load provided it is within the same basic block as the checked load,; and therefore has no additional predicates guarding it. Consider code like the; following:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; movq (%rcx), %rdi; movl (%rdi), %edx; ```. This will get transformed into:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movq (%rcx), %rdi # Hardened load.; movl (%rdi), %edx # Unhardened load due to dependent addr.; ```. This doesn't check the load through `%rdi` as that pointer is dependent on a; checked load already. ###### Protect large, load-heavy blocks with a single lfence. It may be worth using a single `lfence` instruction at the start of a block; which begins with a (very) large number of loads that require ind",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:35417,load,loaded,35417,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['load'],['loaded']

LLVM includes several alias-analysis driven transformations which can be used; with any of the implementations above. The ``-adce`` pass; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``-adce`` pass, which implements Aggressive Dead Code Elimination uses the; ``AliasAnalysis`` interface to delete calls to functions that do not have; side-effects and are not used. The ``-licm`` pass; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``-licm`` pass implements various Loop Invariant Code Motion related; transformations. It uses the ``AliasAnalysis`` interface for several different; transformations:. * It uses mod/ref information to hoist or sink load instructions out of loops if; there are no instructions in the loop that modifies the memory loaded. * It uses mod/ref information to hoist function calls out of loops that do not; write to memory and are loop-invariant. * It uses alias information to promote memory objects that are loaded and stored; to in loops to live in a register instead. It can do this if there are no may; aliases to the loaded/stored memory location. The ``-argpromotion`` pass; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``-argpromotion`` pass promotes by-reference arguments to be passed in; by-value instead. In particular, if pointer arguments are only loaded from it; passes in the value loaded instead of the address to the function. This pass; uses alias information to make sure that the value loaded from the argument; pointer is not modified between the entry of the function and any load of the; pointer.
