Deployability,"@cmnbroad I did a pass with a little cleanup. I think this is ready for review, but has a couple things I left the might help review:. 1) As noted above, the primary purpose here is to migrate to MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart, and remove the redundant re-querying of comp alleles. This seems to work, but has the effect of altering behavior in some cases, described more above. In VariantEvalUtils.java I left some debugging code that illustrates the behavior difference that will occur. . 2) It is a fair question as to whether changing the behavior of what is or isnt considered an overlap is appropriate. For now I'm making changes as though it is, since it's sort of a fringe case and this is a beta tool, but it should be discussed. 3) There are ~6 tests with altered expectations, due to that change in detecting overlaps.

Deployability,@cmnbroad PyPI sound like a reasonable solution with the caveat that we need to make sure the github repo and PyPI are in sync at all times. Perhaps a less error-prone solution for git cloning users is putting together an official setup script @lbergelson and encouraging the users to install GATK via the setup script. The setup script could offer the benefits of `gradlew` while taking care of setting up the conda env and installing GATK python modules at the same time. We must also discourage the users from downloading JARs and make git clone + setup and the docker as the only two official methods of installing and using GATK.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3964#issuecomment-352171869:285,install,install,285,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3964#issuecomment-352171869,3,['install'],"['install', 'installing']"

Deployability,"@cmnbroad The path to the c++ compiler can be specifically provided to theano by setting `theano.config.cxx` in python scripts, or by creating a `.theanorc` in the home directory, or by setting the environmental variable `THEANO_FLAGS=cxx=<path_to_g++>,...`. If a working c++ compiler exists and provided to theano, it is fair to assume that the graph _will_ compile. If the c++ compiler is not explicitly specified, theano will try to discover it. It first tries to execute `g++ -v` in the present environment and if it succeeds, it resolves the absolute path to the executable. On darwin, it further searches for `clang++` and on Win32, it looks for a working mingw gcc setup. We could _enforce_ the presence of a c++ compiler at the beginning of all python scripts and throw an exception and an informative message instead of numpy/python fallback. If we do so, the integration tests (and all gCNV CLI tools) will fail and will force the user to install a c++ compiler.

See: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973/commits/1569a909d3dc2301337e46441cc0cd969843c8d1. The gist is that we now instantiate those classes and pass VariantEvalEngine. Two of these classes had validation in their constructors, and could throw a CommandLineException if the tool was executed with bad arguments. This exception was getting caught and re-thrown as GATKException with the misleading message ""Problem making an instance of ...."". This proposal is to make a separate VariantStratifier.validateArgs() method, with a default no-op validation, and to call this only after instantiation.

Deployability,"@cwhelan & @ldgauthier sorry for the delay on getting back this issue. Firstly, I just grabbed the new release (4.0.12.0) and re-ran with that to generate both gVCF and VCF. The VCF output still generates the 1/1 genotype unfortunately. What's interesting though is that the gVCF is capturing the spanning allele! So it looks like `GenotypeGVCFs` is causing the problem. Here are the rows from the gVCF and VCF respectively (with INFO elided for compactness):. ```; # gVCF; chr6 42932200 . GGC TGT,<NON_REF> 1623.73 . GT:AD:DP:GQ:PL:SB 0/1:39,44,0:83:99:1661,0,1458,1778,1591,3369:10,29,14,30; chr6 42932202 . C T,*,<NON_REF> 3439.77 . GT:AD:DP:GQ:PL:SB 1/2:1,37,44,0:82:99:3468,1802,1661,1518,0,1449,3406,1802,1577,3436:0,1,24,57. # VCF; chr6 42932200 . GGC TGT 1632.77 . GT:AD:DP:GQ:PL 0/1:39,44:83:99:1661,0,1458; chr6 42932202 . C T 3439.77 . GT:AD:DP:GQ:PL 1/1:1,37:82:99:1807,141,0; ```. For completeness I also ran HaplotypeCaller going direct to VCF without making a gVCF first. The results are fairly similar to the VCF above, except for some AD/DP differences:. ```; # Direct to VCF; chr6 42932200 . GGC TGT 1623.73 . GT:AD:DP:GQ:PL 0/1:39,44:83:99:1661,0,1458; chr6 42932202 . C T 3439.77 . GT:AD:DP:GQ:PL 1/1:1,50:51:99:1807,141,0; ```. Going back to what's the right representation - I think I largely agree with @nh13 and @ldgauthier that long term it would be nice, when running with MNP support, to integrate the two haplotypes into a single variant output. But that sounds like it might be a big project and not happening any time soon?

Deployability,"@cwhelan , after our offline discussion about how to make the insertion annotation easier for downstream analysis, I went back and did a check on how insertion annotation are extracted, and here's a summary:. Keys: NARL&mdash;NovelAdjacencyReferenceLocations, CA&mdash;ChimericAlignment, BC&mdash;BreakpointComplications. * NARL contains {mate breakpoint locations, orientation change between the breakpoints, complications around the breakpoint}, where the complication is mainly used for two purposes: 1) adjusting the exact locations of the breakpoints, and 2) useful for downstream annotations for the associated VCF records.; * NARL is constructed from an input CA, which in turn has two ways of being constructed: 1) deliberate construction with two neighboring alignments on the contig, 2) construction from an input contig whose alignments are scanned through in a semi pair-wise fashion. The second way is the master version currently in use in out pipeline, and is planned to be phased out eventually. Note that the second way extracts neighboring alignments that it considers good quality and send the information to the first version for actual construction. ; * The ctor for CA that takes two neighboring alignments also takes in a string representation of mapping locations of suspected insertions. In master version, this information is extracted from the alignments that are considered not strong enough, e.g. lower MQ, shorter alignment length, but the actual inserted sequence is not extracted in CA, but rather in BC.; * The BC field in NARL, holding inserted sequence, micro-homology and other information (e.g. for duplication), does not contain where the inserted sequence, if any, is mapped, and the inserted sequence is extracted from the distance on the contig between two neighboring alignments stored in the input CA.; * The variant, after its NARL locations are pinned down, is annotated by information stored in both CA and BC, where the information for BC is critical for",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3464#issuecomment-331931810:958,pipeline,pipeline,958,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3464#issuecomment-331931810,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"@cwhelan @tedsharpe @vruano @mwalker174 , I've organized the scripts for running the whole sv pipeline as it exists right now. There used to be a PR (if I recall correctly) but since that's outdated, why not an up-to-date one. Here's how to run it. 1. To create the cluster. ```; ./create_cluster.sh broad-dsde-methods sv-methods-1 broad-dsde-methods/sv; ```; where the 1st argument is the project name, 2nd argument is the cluster name, and the 3rd name is the place where input data lives. 2. To run the whole pipeline. ```; ./svCall.sh /Users/shuang/GATK/gatk sv-methods-1 /user/shuang/NA12878_PCR-_30X; ```; where the 1st argument is the location of my GATK directory and the 3rd argument is the location of all outputs on the cluster. So change them as necessary. The different stages called by the master script `svCall.sh` are (in order) `scanBam.sh` -> `assembly.sh` -> `alignAssembly.sh` -> `callVariants.sh`, which all take the same arguments. 3. To delete the whole cluster. ```; ./delete_cluster.sh sv-methods-1; ```; This avoids having to wait for the web-based Console's confirmation. One thing to note though, is that I've copied everything to a bucket at; ```; gs://broad-dsde-methods/sv/; ```; under a different project. We used to be developing under the project ""broad-dsde-dev"", but we are asked to move to project ""broad-dsde-methods"".

Basically, the problem is that this particular assembly contig (more specifically, the last two mappings to the same alt reference ""chromosome"") should be filtered out in the master pipeline because the two alignments are showing a particular signature which I call incomplete picture in the prototyping code&mdash;the assembly contig is suggesting two reference blocks switched orders,; which would normally suggest tandem duplication, but the reference blocks also overlaps (see ribbon plot [here](http://www.genomeribbon.com/?perma=cdB92bihIE)). ; And the filtering criterion is used in a wrong way after #3752 so that this is not caught.

Deployability,"@dantefff Thank you for making this fix. It seems like the recommended solution based on https://blogs.apache.org/logging/entry/log4j-2-11-released. . The downside is that it seems to nearly double the size of the packaged jars. I'm going to try to look into why that is exactly and see if there's a work around. The annoying thing is that we're not really aiming to actually produce a multi-version jar, we just want to incorporate the files that are version specific for the version we need. So I suspect there's probably a way to do this without including many additional versions of each file in the final jar. It might be a bit more involved. .

Deployability,"@david-wb Interesting... what version of spark / spark submit are you using? I was pretty sure that at the point where setMaster() was called by gatk the spark context was already created by yarn and setup with the appropriate master. I wonder if it changed from a previous version of spark... Alternatively, I may be misremembering and relying on the fact that our wrapper script supplies `--sparkMaster yarn` as a gatk argument which would probably override what's being set. Could you try:; ```; spark-submit \; --deploy-mode client \; --class org.broadinstitute.hellbender.Main \; --master yarn \; /home/hadoop/gatk-package-4.alpha.2-269-gdce8abc-SNAPSHOT-spark.jar BwaSpark \; --bwamemIndexImage /var/tmp/hs38DH-V.fasta.img \; -I hdfs:///unaligned.bam \; -O hdfs:///aligned.bam \; -R hdfs:///hg38/hs38DH-V.fasta \; --disableSequenceDictionaryValidation true \; --sparkMaster yarn; ```. or with the wrapper: ; ```; GATK_SPARK_JAR_ENV_VARIABLE=/home/hadoop/gatk-package-4.alpha.2-269-gdce8abc-SNAPSHOT-spark.jar. ./gatk-launch \; --bwamemIndexImage /var/tmp/hs38DH-V.fasta.img \; -I hdfs:///unaligned.bam \; -O hdfs:///aligned.bam \; -R hdfs:///hg38/hs38DH-V.fasta \; --disableSequenceDictionaryValidation true \; -- \; --sparkRunner SPARK \; --sparkMaster yarn; ```. Our wrapper script sets a number of properties which we think are important for running our spark tools. If running directly on spark you might want to set them explicitly. Things like `-Dsamjdk.compression_level=1` have MAJOR performance implications. . Also, be aware the BwaSpark is not in the best health at the moment may have issues.

That patch reduces the number of reads stored in memory at once by the engine by roughly an order of magnitude without doing any extra downsampling at all. I suggest that we do an evaluation to test whether this really resolves the issues you encountered. `Mutect2` is already hooked up to the new, lower-memory traversal code in the latest gatk/master, so all you have to do is re-run your benchmarking test. I'd suggest that you:. 1. Run with default settings in the latest master, and see if that alone does the trick!. 2. If not, try turning up the existing downsampling a bit. Eg., run with `--maxReadsPerAlignmentStart 10` instead of the default of 50. 3.

How easy would it be to modify the likelihood calculation to integrate over all AFs greater than some threshold of interest? I'm hoping that would produce more stability. Just to give you an idea of the fluctuation, below are some lines from my integration test VCF where I block anything less than -2 and between -2 and 0.

Deployability,"@davidbenjamin Sorry I've been out and just got around to looking at this. Given that this test appears to run just fine in the Java 11 job (which is not run on our docker), I suspect the failure may have something to do with the jar file we use to test on the docker (which is not the same jar we use on the non-docker tests). . I pulled your branch and all of the generation tasks (gatk doc, wdl gen, javadoc) seem to work fine, so given how much time it looks like this has taken up, I think it would make sense to either disable this test (on the docker only - see below - since we want it to still run in the other CI integration test job), or else remove the variantcalling package from the test package list (if thats the one thats causing the failure ?). And then create a ticket for me with whatever data you have, which I'll follow up on.

I tested the updated `CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals` with `genomicsDBs` computed in 4.1.7.0 as above and it seems that the workaround recovers a lot of multiallelic variants that were already missing in 4.1.7.0. Using the record and variant counts in 4.1.7.0 as 100% reference, I'm getting 57% more records (all multiallelic) or 142% more variants. No sites from 4.1.7.0 are missing in 4.1.9.0. As a side note, all of the new records have `FRACTION=1` and most (90%) have `BETA=1,1;FRACTION=1`. Among shared records, all multiallelic sites also have `FRACTION=1` and almost always different beta parameter estimates compared to 4.1.7.0. As expected, biallelic sites are unchanged.

I can't call it a bug because mathematically speaking it is an improvement. At worst it can be considered an arbitrary movement along the ROC curve. Regardless, we have always developed Mutect2 and its successor under the principle that theoretical soundness is the best long-term policy. That is not to deny or disregard that some changes harm performance on some data. There is a chance that adjusting the `-f-score-beta`, which controls the relative contribution of recall and precision to the weighted F score that FilterMutectCalls seeks to optimize, will be able to reverse this shift and give up the gained recall in exchange for the lost precision.

Deployability,"@dpmccabe commented on [Mon Apr 24 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/1008). (Very low-priority enhancement request). Allow GetBayesianHetCoverage's matched tumor-normal mode to run on multiple tumor samples matched to a single normal. The normal coverage pulldown and likelihood calculations really only need to be calculated and written to a file once. Alternatively, allow the user to specify a `normalHets` file instead of a BAM if one has already been generated. Thanks!. ---. @samuelklee commented on [Thu Apr 27 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/1008#issuecomment-297704915). We're slowly rebuilding the entire somatic pipeline. One change on the allelic side will be to simply collect allelic counts at all specified sites, rather than performing genotyping on all sites in matched normals and then collecting the corresponding tumor counts at het sites. . The CLI tool to do this (CollectAllelicCounts) is already merged, if you'd like to start using it. You'd only have to run this once on each BAM. The ultimate idea is that resulting allelic count files, along with the corresponding coverage files, could then be passed to a SomaticCNVCaller tool, along with the necessary annotations denoting whether they are tumor or normal. For now, you could probably insert a simple script that performs the genotyping step if you still want to use the rest of the old pipeline but avoid pulling down the normal multiple times.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2977:681,pipeline,pipeline,681,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2977,2,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

We can discuss more with @vdauwera. @stefandiederich Hopefully once you get the conda environment set up you will be able to run the tools. We would definitely appreciate any feedback you might be able to provide. Note that the gCNV model is relatively sophisticated, so there may be some parameters (which control the priors for the model as well as how inference is performed) that you will need to adjust for your data. Depending on the number of intervals/bins you are using and your memory constraints, you may also need to scatter across multiple GermlineCNVCaller runs; see how things are done in the WDLs here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/tree/master/scripts/cnv_wdl/germline. As you noted, this pipeline is still in beta. We are currently running several evaluations and hope to soon release some Best Practices recommendations for the aforementioned parameter values that should work well for various data types generated at the Broad.

Deployability,"@droazen @davidbenjamin any thoughts regarding the last bullet above in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6885#issuecomment-891907471 on possible integration tests? Started looking at this today and was wondering if you might have any suggestions. Ideally, we'd want to test that the exposure was done correctly through the 3 affected tools: HaplotypeCaller, Mutect2, and FilterAlignmentArtifacts. I can certainly take the approach outlined above and 1) on master, pick one or more integration tests for each tool, then generate results by changing the original unexposed constants and running on the relevant test data, 2) on this branch, commit those new results, then add corresponding versions of the integration tests that change the exposed inputs and check against the results. However, not sure if we'll want to clutter the repo with more test files just for this sort of exposing of constants, and such tests don't really feel complete anyway. So alternatively, I could probably write a script to do essentially the same thing and just check consistency between the branches for a bunch of randomly generated SW parameter values, perhaps also running on more substantial test files for each tool. I can document this process and then we can move on without committing any new tests or test files once we're satisfied that the exposure was done correctly. Or if you guys have additional suggestions, would be glad to hear them!. Finally, it looks like FilterAlignmentArtifacts doesn't have any integration tests for correctness---let me know if there are auxiliary tests we'd want to run there. Anyway, probably overthinking things, but the exposure was enough of a headache that I want to make sure I did it right. But would also rather fully hash out what to do beforehand, so I don't end up having to redo things after review.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6885#issuecomment-896314077:156,integrat,integration,156,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6885#issuecomment-896314077,4,['integrat'],['integration']

Deployability,"@droazen @ldgauthier @eitanbanks @tfenne the issue with `GenotypeGvcfs` outputting the wrong phase will still exist, even if @tfenne makes the change to `HaplotypeCaller` (@tfenne: could you move further discussion of that fix to https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5772). While the above example is fairly simple to understand, since `GenotypeGvcfs` run on a single sample will simply re-capitulate the genotype from the gVCF. In this case, could we just compare the `PGT` field and the `GT` field to ensure they agree, and if they don't, swap the alleles in the `GT` field (for hets only)? . This brings up an other issue: what happens with multiple samples? If the genotype is changed for a sample, how is phasing information affected (in the PGT/PID fields too)? I couldn't find a place where the phasing information is updated when re-genotyping (`PGT/PID` are fixed). I think this is beyond my ability to fix and determine (i.e. understanding how the `GenotypingEngine` works), but unfortunately, this is still a bug. Presumably the `PGT/PID` fields are correct, as they have been used in large call-sets (ex. Exac/Gnomad) without any bug reports, so is there a simple workaround like the above single-sample case?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5727#issuecomment-471038038:832,update,updated,832,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5727#issuecomment-471038038,2,['update'],['updated']

I think that it was a deliberate decision to lift all reads into the initial rdd and then filter them in the transforms to what was needed by that transform. This is paying some performance cost in multi-stage pipelines which will potentially apply the same filters over and over again, but it simplifies the code because the filters can be baked into the transform and the pipeline writer doesn't have to think about them.

Deployability,"@droazen Thank you for the confirmation that HaplotypeCaller performs separate filtering passes on the read mapping qualities, and that the code on line 729 of HaplotypeCallerEngine.java (method ```filterNonPassingReads()``` ) is indeed executing subsequent to the ```MappingQualityReadFilter```. May I suggest, however, that MAPQ values less than 20 might not necessarily lead to an increase in FP variant calls? My understanding is that HaplotypeCaller uses MAPQ values only in a nonparametric rank sum test, in which case MAPQ is treated as an ordinal. This seems appropriate since the magnitude of a MAPQ value depends both on the data and on the computational model the read aligner uses to calculate it. With this in mind, a set of mappings with MAPQ in a lower range (e.g., ```--minimum-mapping-quality 10``` and a correspondingly lower ```--maximum-mapping-quality``` as well) might very well be appropriate for variant calling. So changing the semantics of ```MappingQualityReadFilter``` or parameterizing the currently-hardwired MAPQ range would enable additional control without affecting performance. @jamesemery I will watch for the HaplotypeCaller update that implements that functionality. And if you have a moment, could you please point me to the code that might be adversely affected by decreasing the low-end MAPQ threshold? I might have some ideas about that (or not!)...

Deployability,"@droazen any thoughts how we should proceed here, if at all? @ldgauthier reminded me that this story was unfinished and is getting a little stale. @fleharty take note if we want to report progress on this front to our MalariaGEN collaborators. On my end, there are a couple of things to do:; - [x] rebase and resolve conflicts; - [x] change TSV input as discussed above; - [x] add doc strings for new arguments; - [x] add integration tests to make absolutely sure exposure was done correctly, perhaps? I'm open to discussion about how this should be done. Complete coverage here will be difficult and perhaps not worth the effort, but I can probably put in a few tests that make sure changing the hard-coded values in master and doing the same via the exposed parameters in this branch have the same effect on a few existing test cases. However, while I'm doing the last three, I wonder if we could run whatever canonical evaluations/optimizations we have to see whether it's worth consolidating some of the parameter sets at this stage? I think there's an argument for having at least two sets (haplotype-to-reference + read-to-haplotype), but I'm not sure how to justify having a separate set for dangling heads/tails. But also not sure which set the latter should be consolidated with---@jamesemery thoughts? Again, let me reiterate that it seems that many of these parameter values were chosen arbitrarily (or, if not, that the procedure for choosing them has been lost). As a start, you can see the results of some optimizations I did on the CHM mix on slide 15 at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zGuquAZWSUQ-wNxp8D6HhGNjIaFcV0_X9WAS4LODbEo/edit?usp=sharing Here, I optimized over haplotype-to-reference + read-to-haplotype SW parameters on various metrics after variant normalization using vcfeval.

Deployability,"@droazen commented on [Thu Apr 28 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473). This capability would be useful if it turns out that the CNV tools (for example) need to be released much more frequently than the GATK as a whole. We don't want a release of the CNV tools to be blocked for a long time because something else in the toolkit (like the `HaplotypeCaller`) is not ready for release. . There could be a `properties` file in the jar that controls which tools are exposed via the command-line -- this way we could publish a jar that exposes only the CNV tools, for example. An alternative approach would be to use branching and cherry-picking to do this kind of selective release, or split the GATK into even more repositories, but I'm not sure those approaches would be preferable. ---. @droazen commented on [Thu Apr 28 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215491991).

So a gatk release would contain different sets of tools sometimes? Wouldn't that be confusing? It seems like it would be better to always release different jars, or version sets of tools independently and release jars with the latest good release of each individual set of tools. ---. @droazen commented on [Thu Apr 28 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215494432). @lbergelson Well, we definitely still want there to be releases of the GATK toolkit in its entirety. If the CNV tools need to be released more frequently than this, they could be versioned/released separately and periodically incorporated into the toolkit-wide releases. ---. @droazen commented on [Thu Apr 28 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215495326).

Deployability,@droazen sorry for a late response. I agree moving to java 17 would help.

Gatk being a very useful tool gets integrated in multiple other tools and pipelines so in a way affecting the security posture of where its being used.

Deployability,"@droazen sure. This PR updates both `BucketUtils.getPathOnGcs` and `IOUtils.getPath` (the latter indirectly) to create a Google Cloud Storage filesystem with a default reopen set to 3. Anyone opening the given `Path` (or even a `Path` derived from it, e.g. via `subpath`) will have the retries enabled. `addPrefetcher` wraps an existing `Path`, so it inherits the underlying `Path`'s retry behavior. Classes within htsjdk that create a `Path` from a String, without using our utility code, would indeed not set retries and errors on those files would not get the benefit of our extra retry. The exception to that is the Spark code path with `NioBam`: this goes via `ReadsIterable`, which also sets the retries. My understanding is that the normal way to open BAMs for tools always creates the `Path` object when parsing the command line, as in e.g. `ReadInputArgumentCollection::GetReadIndexPaths()`. That code path that calls `IOUtils.getPath` (and thus sets the retries). I would expect that the added support for VCF follows the same style, though it looks like it doesn't.

Deployability,"@droazen the reason for hardcoding the full path is to handle grouping of arrays. TileDB manages arrays hierarchically. A workspace can contain arrays or groups of arrays. Groups can have different arrays with same name. When you read from an existing array or update it with a given workspace path, you need to figure out which array in the the group you are referring to, hence the full path. More information [here](http://istc-bigdata.org/tiledb/tutorials/index.html#workspaces_groups). The real issue here is to figure out a way to package TileDB arrays to ship it to some other location. The problem is the data and fragments inside the array directory is self-contained. If we replace the full path in the schema it will break other conventions for groups and workspaces.

Deployability,"@droazen this behavior hasn't changed in the most recent GenomicsDB release. . Short recap: this happens because bcf codec doesn't support the 64 bit values that GenomicsDB is returning. Running with `--genomicsdb-use-vcf-codec` will resolve it. From our discussions in the office hours, I thought we had decided to change the behavior in htsjdk so that it doesn't try to decode the type if it doesn't recognize it. (maybe I should have filed https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6548 in htsjdk instead? I thought I was told to do in GATK, but its been long enough that I can't remember). Another possibility is to make `--genomicsdb-use-vcf-codec` the default - though I recall you had some potential performance concerns about that.

Deployability,"@fleharty If you can come up with a way to handle genotypes with missing AD in the tool (that does not involve dropping them completely) I believe that would solve the problem, yes. The following code snippet from the tool shows the current behavior, where genotypes get filtered out if AD is missing:. ```; final List<Genotype> variantGenotypes = vc.getGenotypes().stream(); .filter(g -> hasArtifact(g, germlineAF)).collect(Collectors.toList());. private final boolean hasArtifact(final Genotype g, final double populationAlleleFrequency) {; final int altCount = altCount(g);; if (altCount == 0) {; return false;; }; final int totalCount = (int) MathUtils.sum(g.getAD());. return germlineProbability(populationAlleleFrequency, altCount, totalCount) < maxGermlineProbability;; }. private static final int altCount(final Genotype g) {; return g.hasAD() ? (int) MathUtils.sum(g.getAD()) - g.getAD()[0] : 0;; }; ```. AD will be missing completely if there were *any* missing values present after combination, due to the issues in HTSJDK discussed above. These missing values are there only because the pipeline is combining VCFs rather than GVCFs -- with GVCFs, you have the NON_REF allele and can fill in these missing values. Back when GenomicsDB used the BCF codec by default, the AD value would get truncated at the first missing value, instead of completely removed as it does with the VCF codec. This suggests that the AD values the tool was seeing were never correct in the first place, and the tool should probably be relying on a different attribute. Only AD and PL are affected by this HTSJDK issue. Is there another attribute you could use instead of AD in `CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals`?.

The latest Funcotator code (not yet merged into master - pr #6660) has parser updates to allow for these new values, but the old code (GATK 4.1.8.1 and earlier) doesn't have these parsing updates. This is the unfortunate price we pay for updating the Gencode datasource with the new datasources release. ☹️ . The issue you ran into is not exactly a bug, but an artifact of our data source release process. In order to test them, the data sources must be posted before the code changes to support them (so we can test the code against the data sources as released). Unfortunately there was no warning mechanism to users to let them know that newer data source versions are not yet supported (checks against older versions were already present). I've created an issue (#6712) and a branch ([jts_funcotator_version_max_6712](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/tree/jts_funcotator_version_max_6712)) that adds in such checks, so pretty soon there will be a warning rather than a confusing stack trace.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6708#issuecomment-662200608:313,update,updates,313,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6708#issuecomment-662200608,5,"['release', 'update']","['release', 'released', 'updates']"
Deployability,"@fpbarthel In that case, I would not average the bins---I'd simply take the total integer count across them, which you can then use with the rest of the pipeline and should decrease the noise as you describe. You can still use CollectReadCounts, but it will be up to you whether you want to 1) collect counts on manually merged bins, or 2) collect counts on the initial bins and manually sum the counts for the merged bins. Another option might be to use PreprocessIntervals to create 10kb bins across the genome and then manually intersect that with your list of exons (i.e., keeping only the bins that overlap with your exons) before collecting counts. There are multiple ways one might define such merged bins, which makes it hard to come up with a single tool to cover every possibility. Fortunately, it should be relatively easy for users to put together their own custom script for merging bins. For these reasons, I think it makes sense to not focus too much CNV-team development effort on adding features like this---our philosophy is to leave such pre/postprocessing steps to the user, and focus on CNV-specific algorithms such as denoising, segmentation, etc. Hopefully that makes sense!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5432#issuecomment-439916142:153,pipeline,pipeline,153,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5432#issuecomment-439916142,2,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"@frank-y-liu Something has gone slightly wrong in this branch git-wise -- it looks like you've duplicated some commits from master, and the merge commits in your history imply that your git workflow needs some tweaking. In general, you want to always `rebase` rather than `merge` or `pull` (and avoid mixing the two, which can cause problems), since `rebase` produces a much cleaner history. Since you're working in a fork, you should create an ""upstream"" remote if you haven't already:. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk.git`. Then when you're working in a branch to which you've made one or more commits, and you want to update your branch with the latest changes from our master, do this:. `git fetch upstream`; `git rebase -i upstream/master`. This will bring up a screen allowing you to ""squash"" (combine) your work into a single commit that is suitable for merging into our master branch. If you do this with the current version of your branch, and select ""squash"" for all but the top commit, I believe you'll succeed in repairing your git history. . Note that after each `rebase`, when you want to push your changes to github you'll need to do a `git push -f` instead of a simple `git push`, since `rebase` changes your commit history.

I then wrote a little [test](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/3bb178746b1dd286f55ba77e6939e2104ced98d0) using `AlleleSubsettingUtils` to access `GenotypeLikelihoodCalculators` 10^6 times to see the effect of adding synchronization. R session (times are in millis):; ```; > without_sync = c(10166, 10049, 10306, 10059, 10165); > with_sync = c(10700, 10384, 9923, 10097, 10190); > t.test(without_sync, with_sync, paired=TRUE). 	Paired t-test. data: without_sync and with_sync; t = -0.70447, df = 4, p-value = 0.52; alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0; 95 percent confidence interval:; -542.5421 322.9421; sample estimates:; mean of the differences ; -109.8 ; ```. The p-value is not less than 0.05, so we can't reject the null hypothesis (that the mean times are the same). So adding synchronization doesn't seem to make any difference in this test. BTW, I noticed that `GenotypeLikelihoods` has synchronization, so there is some precedent for thread-safety using this means.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5071#issuecomment-426338479:26,update,updated,26,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5071#issuecomment-426338479,1,['update'],['updated']

Perhaps if omitted, all intervals (inferred from genome) would be used?. 3) Alternately, perhaps there could be a shortcut way to pass ""all intervals in the genome"" to GATK in the -L argument?

My point in logging this issue is mostly that `EMIT_ALL_SITES` is pretty misleading as it stands.

Deployability,"@jamesemery the use of padding is a little confusing. One use of padding is for providing extra reference bases around the reads. This is the case in `ReadWalkerSpark`, for example. When the whole reference is available via the Spark files mechanism (which is what this PR is about) then there is no need for padding (and in the case of `ReadWalkerSpark`, no need for sharding at all). Therefore it makes sense to remove the use of padding in these cases. Another use of padding was for providing more reads around an area of interest in assembly region/haplotype caller tools. This is no longer the case though, since the refactoring that @droazen did in `HaplotypeCaller` in #4031. However, `HaplotypeCallerSpark` has not been updated to reflect the changes from that refactoring, so it's probably best not to change the padding in that class. I've reverted the change there for this reason. The locus walkers never had any need for padding, except for padding reference bases in `LocusWalkerSpark`, mentioned above.

Since you didn't include one as part of the hdfs path on the command line, it looks like transform along the way resulted in one being added (the authority component looks like ""host:port""), resulting in the port number -1. So I'm not clear if its a configuration issue, or a bad code code path, or both. But I would suggest trying an hdfs path with a valid authority component (one that works with the hadoop shell). @SHuang-Broad I do see some code paths in `StructuralVariationDiscoveryPipelineSpark` that call `Paths.get directly`, rather than `IOUtils.getPath()`.

Not all of the validation steps need to be all bash; the first one was because it's literally just a call to make sure a table exists and has rows with `vid` values in it.

Deployability,"@kcibul That NPE suggests that GenomicsDBImporter is failing to find a reader for a particular sample name. One possible cause of this is disagreement between the samples in your `--sampleNameMap` file and the sample names in the VCF headers. Due to a bug that I noticed just now (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2714), the `GenomicsDBImporter` class in GenomicsDB unnecessarily uses the actual VCF headers to construct a list of sample names internally, which it then uses to query a map of `sample -> reader` that was (in your case) populated using the contents of the `--sampleNameMap` file. I've asked Intel to fix that bug in GenomicsDB (ie., use the sample names passed in to it instead of going back to the VCF headers), but it will probably take them 1-2 days, since a new GenomicsDB release will be required. In the meantime @kcibul, I suggest you try running without the `--sampleNameMap` argument and see if the problem goes away. It will likely be a bit slower, since it will download all VCF headers up-front, but it seems to me to greatly decrease the opportunity for this particular NPE to occur.

Deployability,"@koncheto-broad this is one of the VQSR-lite PRs you will want to eventually rebase on. It's still awaiting review (I was waiting until the dust from updating to Java 17 in #8035 settles), but if anyone from your team wants to take a first crack, feel free! Not too many code changes, so hopefully it should be pretty manageable. Just so it's all in one place: your #8157 GVS branch is currently rebased on #7954, which contains the ""serial SNP-then-indel"" version of the Joint Genotyping WDL (written by Megan for Ultima) and the Java code for the tools. Some minor updates were made to the Java code in #8049 and the WDL was rewritten by me to do SNPs and indels in a single pass in #8074. (EDIT: I was originally confused here, the WDL that was replaced in this PR simply ran SNPs and indels separately, rather than serially—thanks to George for correcting me here.). The PR here makes relatively minor updates to both the Java code and the WDL and might require very minor updates to GVS code or JSON configurations. And finally, the larger PR at #8132 adds a Pure Java BGMM backend.

My 2 cents for the md5 proposal is: what will happen if people install the python requirements without a conda environment? If I understood correctly how the GATK python executor works, the package version that should be checked should be the one in [src/main/python/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/gatktool/_version.py](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/src/main/python/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/gatktool/_version.py) - the manifest can include a `gatk-tool-Version` entry that is populated from the previous file and that will fix @lbergelson's comment and also for downstream toolkits (althought populating the manifest entries might be difficult). Something better for downstream toolkits will be to create a `gatk.properties` file with entries for both the GATK-jar version and gatktool-python version; it can be easily parsed by gradle to populate the values.

Deployability,"@lbergelson I added the ClassLoader fallback code in to `GATKPathSpecifier`.

So I updated the tests to use `GATKPathSpecifier` (they all passed), then integrated the fallback code and changed 3 negative tests that went from FileSystemNotFoundException to ProviderNotFoundException.

They are assertion failures from `h5diff` indicating that the actual outputs did not match the expected outputs, so there are likely actual numerical differences here.

Deployability,"@lbergelson Sorry to be unclear---this isn't a GATK issue. For Cromwell, you can configure various options for each backend. For example, if you are running on a local backend with Docker, you can set a `submit-docker` attribute to specify the string that runs the Docker container; so to solve the above problem, you'd set this to include `--shm-size` and set it accordingly. However, according to @jsotobroad, you're not allowed such an attribute when submitting to Google cloud. If that's the case, then this is more of an issue with the Cromwell/Google Pipelines interface than the data.table package (although, as the discussion in the GitHub issue above shows, it'd be a simple fix on the data.table end, so I'm not sure why it's not addressed yet...) Changing the R script to get around the issue in this particular case is not unacceptably ugly, but you could imagine we might run into a similar problem in the future if anything else exceeds the 64MB /dev/shm limit and also cannot specify tmpfs.

Deployability,"@lbergelson sorry for my late response. I'm currently on vacations but I will try to respond (with some delay) any question.; So, what I'm seeing here (using Github web without having a proper dev env) is that for each interval, it's going to call (in parallel) sample reader function from the configuration =>; ```; final Map<String, FeatureReader<VariantContext>> sampleToReaderMap =; this.config.sampleToReaderMapCreator().apply(; this.config.getSampleNameToVcfPath(), updatedBatchSize, index); ; ```; That's is the first difference from previous implementation. If whatever you have in that function consume lots of memory, that's an issue.; Regarding the thread pool, I'm not seeing it's being starved by chromosome parallel import but it might use extra memory to execute since there is a high load of threads use due to the number of parallel imports.; Worker threads can execute only one task at the time, but the ForkJoinPool doesn’t create a separate thread for every single subtask. Instead, each thread in the pool has its own double-ended queue (or deque, pronounced deck) **which stores tasks**.

Deployability,"@lbergelson. Our simple s3 nio library is not currently open source, but we would be willing to make it so after testing it properly. We found that to get the s3 nio library work with GATK, a few minor changes needed to be made in the GATK source. This is especially true for the spark tools because, on AWS EMR Spark clusters, s3 uris can be treated exactly as if they are HDFS uris. Therefore, it was not quite as simple for us to just add the s3 nio library to the classpath and have everything work as expected.

As we received the instruction to use GATK lastest (4.2.6.1) we tried to run the entire pipeline using the latest one (since ReblockGVCF til JointGenotype)...Unfortunately, it seems that the latest ReblockGVCF hasn't the needed changes to work completely with the JoinGenotype Pipeline (without Gnarly), because we received the error below, once again. I think maybe we'll need to run Snapshop reblock with the newest GATK for the other steps. Please, let me know if you think it's safe to use this approach (snapshot Reblock - 4.2.3~, plus GATK 4.2.6.1 entire JG pipeline).

The tests need updating, but it's easier to see what breaks then fix than run the tests locally! But please see if you agree with the rest of the PR while I update the tests manually. A few notes on the various tools related to making the genotype phased:. 1. Both `HaplotypeCaller` and `Mutect2` support the `--do-not-run-physical-phasing`, so all this can be turned off by the user. I am not going to add another command line option as this may confuse the user.; 2. `FilterMutectCalls` uses the `Mutect2FilteringEngine` internally. It does not look at the order of the alleles in the genotype (`GT` FORMAT field), but does look at the various other per-allele FORMAT fields (ex. `AD`, `AF`). Fortunately, I do not change their order in this PR as suggested by @ldgauthier.; 3. As @ldguathier note [in this comment](https://github.com/nh13/gatk4/pull/1#issuecomment-433970809) and [in this comment](https://github.com/nh13/gatk4/pull/1#issuecomment-433986488), that VQSR and Sam F's work do not look at genotypes either.; 4.

The very last commit changes the default radius to 2... I was planning to set it to 0 since it is more parsimonious (less complex configuration) but it may well affect sensitivity and certainly changes the PL/QUAL values so I guess set the value two the current 2 (for PLs) is a safer and more conservative approach until we evaluate what is the optimal value for this parameter. .

Deployability,"@ldgauthier @yfarjoun We have an update on this! We've identified the bug:. * When `AbstractFeatureReader.getFeatureReader()` tries to open a `.vcf.gz` that doesn't have an index, it returns a `TribbleIndexedFeatureReader` instead of a `TabixFeatureReader`, because `methods.isTabix()` returns false when an index is not present.; * `TribbleIndexedFeatureReader`, in turn, opens a Java vanilla `GZIPInputStream`, instead of the `BlockCompressedInputStream` that gets opened when you create a `TabixFeatureReader`.; * `GZIPInputStream`, in turn, has a *confirmed bug* filed against it in Oracle's bug tracker (see https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7036144#), that it inappropriately relies on the `available()` method to detect end-of-file, which is never safe to do given the contract of `available()`; * As the final piece in the ghastly puzzle, implementations of `SeekableStream` in htsjdk do not implement `available()` at all, instead using the default implementation which always returns 0. As a result of this combination of bugs in Java's `GZIPInputStream` itself and bugs in htsjdk's `SeekableStream` classes, end-of-file can be detected prematurely when within 26 bytes of the end of a block, due to the following code in `GZIPInputStream.readTrailer()`:. ```; if (this.in.available() > 0 || n > 26) {; ....; }; return true; // EOF; ```. Where `n` is the number of bytes left to inflate in the current block. The solution is to replace all usages of the bugged `GZIPInputStream` with `BlockCompressedInputStream` in tribble in htsjdk (at least, for points in the code where the input is known to be block-gzipped rather than regular gzipped). For due diligence we should also implement `available()` correctly for all implementations of `SeekableStream` in htsjdk.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4224#issuecomment-360282461:33,update,update,33,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4224#issuecomment-360282461,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"@ldgauthier I think at some point we removed example JSONs in both the CNV and M2 WDL directories.

In contrast, providing Jack's hyperparameters for WES via JSONs will actually be informative!

Deployability,"@ldgauthier Tests are still failing because I haven't updated test vcfs. Before I do so could I get your opinion? Here's a summary of the rationale behind each commit:. * fa34758 When we get to `realignReadToBestHaplotype` we have discarded bases outside of the assembly region but we still have hard clips in the read Cigar. This change forces us to keep those Cigar elements after realigning to the best haplotype so that we know how far past the assembly window the read extended.; * 6af7ad4 After the above change, `BaseQualityRankSum` was liable to look for discarded bases in the hard-clipped part of the read. This fixes that.; * 952d217 The `Clipping` annotation doesn't do anything. It counts the number of hard clips, but pre-this PR there are no hard clips because those bases don't get realigned to the best haplotype and post-this PR the ""hard clips"" are just bases outside the assembly region. As a placeholder I'm setting it to zero (note how this doesn't break any tests!) but really I think we should just get rid of it.; * This PR introduced some off-by-one errors in the depth annotation (but not the ADs). While looking into this I found an apparent bug where some reads that don't overlap a variant get counted in the depth. The issue was that we were counting clipped bases in the overlap. I don't think this is correct because by this point in the code we have unclipped soft clips and gone through local reassembly. Therefore, anything clipped here is a part of the read we truly don't believe belongs anywhere near the assembly region. This change alone breaks the tests with a few off-by-one DP fields.; * 8c51c0a Uses hard clips in the Cigar to correct read position annotations.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4956#issuecomment-400755806:54,update,updated,54,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4956#issuecomment-400755806,1,['update'],['updated']

The haplotype with the 9bp deletion stays the same, but the haplotype with the SNP turns into two separate deletions -- one of 1bp and one of 8bp. #### Steps to reproduce; Data where this was reported is sensitive, but I added a unit test that reproduces the problem using the haplotype sequences from the data (SWPairwiseAlignmentUnitTest::testLongHapDeletionNearSNP in the branch ldg_SWparamExamples). #### Expected behavior; CIGARs for the deletion haplotype sequences with and without the SNP should be the same. #### Actual behavior; CIGARs for the deletion haplotype sequences with and without the SNP have different deletions. Specifically, in this case, the SNP causes the deletion to be represented as two separate deletions seemingly to avoid the mismatch penalty. ---. @ldgauthier commented on [Thu Nov 10 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1508#issuecomment-259727960).

You'll notice that both `GT` and `PGT` have phased genotypes. And in the case of samples with a homozygous genotype, the `PGT` has an incorrect heterozygous genotype. Going back and looking more closely at the test files that I updated, I also see where the `GT` is `1|1` that the `PGT` is erroneously heterozgyous. In talking to @nh13 about this, he pointed me at a section of code in `AssemblyBasedCallerGenotypingEngine` that purposefully sets the genotype to either `0|1` or `1|0` with a long note on line 512 that this is on purpose and that it'll get ""fixed"" later. Evidently that's not happening on the code path in `HaplotypeCaller` that generates a VCF as opposed to a GVCF.

Deployability,"@ldgauthier this finishes what we started in #4858 and is necessary for the pileup-calls-on-bamouts MC3 validation. The cause is the same, in that Pair-HMM has a tiny bias in favor of shorter haplotypes and thus it prefers deletion haplotypes when reads end inside STRs. In #4858 we broke near-ties in favor of the reference; this PR fixes the case where two alt haplotypes share a SNV and one of them has a spurious deletion. One important sanity check was that when I set `cigarTerm` to zero in `AssemblyBasedCallerUtils.java` no tests broke. This means that the refactoring needed to set up the change didn't affect behavior. I looked at most of the sites where `PL`s and/or `DP`s changed in the integration test vcfs and in every case the difference was from a fake deletion that this PR fixed. I also went through the diff of the bamouts in IGV and found the same thing.

It looks like the name of the argument that the warning is complaining about (`num_thermal_advi_iters`) was introduced in #4720 (and replaced `num_thermal_epochs`, which is present in your python invocation), so I'm guessing you might be using a version of the jar/Docker that is older than that?.

Deployability,"@lucidtronix @mbabadi @samuelklee I think the best solution would be to establish a single, common Python environment, with a single set of dependencies, that all GATK Python tools depend on. We would establish a single docker image that has all of these dependencies pip installed, and could also include a conda env for the GATK environment for users who don't want to use the docker image. If we could do that, it would eliminate the need load per-tool conda environments. From what I've seen so far based on existing branches, the two environments we need (gCNV and CNN-VQSR) don't look that far apart in terms of dependencies. gCNV is using Theano, and CNN Tensorflow, but the rest looks [pretty close](https://docs.google.com/a/broadinstitute.org/spreadsheets/d/1RV7--uBQ0ctlXzMH09cmr0VimpZYIU68DdxJzE60y-c/edit?usp=sharing). So a strawman proposal for the main components for a common environment would be:. Python 3.6; Numpy >= 1.13.1; Scipy 1.0.0; Theano .0.9.0; Tensorflow 1.4.0; Pymc3 3.1; Keras 2.1.1.

As the slide mentions, we have given some thought to supplementing the main version number with an ""API version number"", but we'd have to more clearly define what constitutes the official public API for the GATK before doing so. On a side note, now that we're in general release it may be easier for you to get PRs for things like new walker types merged into the GATK proper, particularly if they are fairly self-contained and don't involve refactoring lots of engine classes.

Deployability,"@magicDGS The HaplotypeCaller traversal has undergone some changes in the past few weeks to improve performance and bring the output of the tool closer to GATK3. There is now an `AssemblyRegionWalker` that divides the intervals into active and inactive regions, in a greatly simplified version of the GATK3 traversal. Initially, I did plan on having `AssemblyRegionWalker` extend the former `ReadWindowWalker`, or an adapted version of your `SlidingWindowWalker`, and I did implement it like this at first, but ultimately I collapsed it into a single class for several reasons:; - Inheriting from a more generic traversal type caused usability issues and confusion with respect to the command-line arguments. The `ReadWindow` was the unit of processing for the superclass, but for `AssemblyRegionWalker` it was the unit of I/O and `AssemblyRegion` was the unit of processing, and I couldn't update the docs for `ReadWindowWalker` to clear up the confusion without mentioning `AssemblyRegion`-specific concepts.; - The `ReadShard` / `ReadWindow` was/is **only** there to prove that we can shard the data without introducing calling artifacts, and to provide a unit of parallelism for the upcoming Spark implementation. It's not something we really want to expose to users as a prominent knob, and we may hide it completely in the future once the shard size is tuned for performance.; - Inheriting from a more abstract walker type caused a number of other problems as well: methods that should have been final in the supertype could no longer be made final, with the result that tool implementations could inappropriately override engine initialization/shutdown routines. Also, there were issues with the progress meter, since both the supertype traversal and subtype traversal needed their own progress meter for their different units of processing. Ultimately it was just too awkward and forced, and the read shard is something that we eventually want to make an internal/encapsulated implementation d",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1708#issuecomment-210806513:891,update,update,891,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1708#issuecomment-210806513,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"@mbabadi commented on [Fri Feb 17 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/914). The current coverage tool in the GATK CNV pipeline, i.e. `CalculateTargetCoverage` has important caveats that make the ab-initio modeling of coverage data and subsequent CNV analysis inaccurate. We need to write a principled tool for calculating read depth histograms from targetted sequencing data. Given that a major source of coverage variance in targetted sequencing stems from the variance in bait efficiencies, the most reasonable read-depth calculation scheme is to associate **inserts to baits** rather than **single reads to targets**. No more arbitrary interval padding (which was a hacky way to get away not thinking about inserts). There is a subtle problem, though: inserts often overlap with more than one bait. In such cases, we need to have a model for estimating the probability that the insert is captured by either of the overlapping baits. The modeling can be done in the following semi-empirical fashion (thanks @yfarjoun), which needs to be done only once for each capture technology (Agilent, ICE):; - We locate isolated baits (i.e. those that are separated from one another by a few standard deviations of the average insert size); - We take a number of BAMs and calculate the empirical distribution of inserts around the isolated baits; - We fit a simple parametric distribution to the obtained empirical distributions, parameterized by bait length and insert length; we probably don't need to go all-in here, though the reference context of the bait is also likely to be an important covariate. Once these distributions are known, we can easily calculate the membership share of each bait in ambiguous cases and give each bait the appropriate share. Bonus:; -------. The empirical distribution of inserts around baits also allows us to associate a more reasonable GC content to each bait.

This is a long shot, but the idea is to be able to learn biases from mixed N/T cohorts. In a way, this is similar to semisupervised learning where the _stiff_ integer-state HMM on normal samples lead the way of learning biases (as a matter of imposing a strong copy-neutrality prior), and tumor samples along with a _loose_ infinite HMM provide additional (though generalically less) statistical power. Weak tumor-in-normal contamination can be handled using an adaptive integer-state HMM where the quantizied copy ratio states are chosen uniformly, though, adaptively. In the future, we must move toward a generic CLI tool called something like FancySchmancyCNVCaller that can perform the following tasks in its idealized form:. - create PoN and make calls from normals; - create PoN and make calls from tumors (possible with iHMM); - create PoN and make calls from mixed normals and tumors (possible with iHMM); - make calls from a given model on normals; - make calls from a given model on tumors; - make calls from a given model on mixed normals and tumors. The tool would then additionally take a sample annotation table (normal, tumor) and perform its job. For the first release, all samples have be annotated as normal; otherwise, an UnsupportedFeatureException is thrown.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3004:1280,release,release,1280,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3004,1,['release'],['release']

At the moment, the maximum copy number in gCNV is set by the dimension provided transition matrices. One needs to work with copy number states up to 10 ~ 20 in order to capture high copy number states seen in certain regions. It is desirable to limit the number of states, however, to designate a special state that represents _all copy number states at and above CN_max_. This can be achieved by adjusting the emission probability to integrate over all higher copy number states. There are other challenges too (e.g. calculating copy number posteriors from such states).",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3001:538,integrat,integrate,538,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3001,1,['integrat'],['integrate']

Deployability,"@mlathara and @nalinigans A couple quick updates:. - ReblockGVCFs reduced gVCF size by 5-8x as advertised. I re-ran this on our ~2000 gVCFs, which is possibly one of the main reasons for improvement below.; - This meant we needed to scrap all existing workspaces. As a side comment, the poor tools around manipulation of GenomicsDB workspaces is a pretty major disadvantage. Your guidance seems to suggest they are designed as a quasi-permanent store of gVCF data. Maybe I'm missing something, but this doesnt seem very workable anymore. Any need to modify any sample that went into the workspace means the whole thing needs to be re-created. For example, we also plan to re-generate some older gVCFs with the newer HaplotypeCaller at some point in the future, and doing this would also mean we need to scrap any existing workspaces. ; - For this round, I started with the 2000 gVCFs, and ran scatter jobs where each has ~1/750th of the genome, split more or less evenly (i.e. no attempt yet to intelligently design borders). Unlike before, each job creates the workspace on-the-fly, and then immediately uses it for GenotypeGVCFs. The workspace is basically a throw-away intermediate file. As far as computational time, this is not that bad (at least for very small intervals/job). I also did not bother running consolidate on these, and imported with a batchSize of 50.; - With the limited interval GenomicsDB workspaces, GenotypeGVCFs runs reasonably well. . So some open questions:. - It's unclear why running GenotypeGVCFs with a GenomicsDB workspace that has intact chromosomes, even when using -L over a small interval, fails to run or runs painfully slowly with extremely high memory. I will try to find time for actual profiling, but this is a little cumbersome since I'm not sure I can run this on my windows dev machine.

Deployability,"@nalinigans pointed out that even if we do switch this pipeline back to the BCF codec, it's still likely to encounter errors with 64-bit values due to some recent changes in GenomicsDB, which now throws an exception for these values instead of silently truncating them as it did in the past. So just switching to the BCF codec in the WDL might not be enough. A couple of other options we discussed today for a quick fix for this issue:. - @ldgauthier suggested that we change the WDL to use an older (pre-4.1.8.0) version of GATK that is known to work well with this pipeline, which would be an easy change. The only problem is that users might run `CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals` in the latest GATK independently of the WDL anyway and continue to run into this issue. - @nalinigans suggested that we patch `CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals` so that it does something sensible when the AD annotation is completely missing. Since AD was already likely being truncated by the BCF codec in previous versions of this pipeline, its value was never particularly trustworthy to begin with. Whatever option we go with, we'll need to add a good regression test for the PoN workflow that would have caught this issue. Longer term, we'll plan on developing a fix at the HTSJDK level for the way missing values are handled for the AD and PL annotations in the VCF codec (@lbergelson is currently looking into how this could be done). @fleharty What are your thoughts?

He then tested firt extracting the combined GVCF from genomics db and then running GenotypeGVCFs and saw that memory usage for GenotypeGVCFs remained constant at 1 G. So we think this is probably a GenomicsDB issue. .

Deployability,"@neuro2019 Well, the gatkDoc task relies on running the javadoc process with a custom doclet. I'm not sure why its not working for you, but a few suggestions to try. You can try running `javadoc` from the command line to make sure you have the executable. Also, it looks like you're trying to run from within`/usr/bin`. Not sure if thats deliberate, but do other gradle tasks succeed there, i.e., does `./gradlew shadowJar` work ? I would expect that `./gradlew javadoc` would also fail ? Also, normally the gatkDoc task is only run by us when we do a new release and publish the doc. Its not something most users would need to do.

Deployability,"@nh13 As a first step I'd suggest filing a ticket against the GKL (https://github.com/Intel-HLS/GKL) so that Intel engineers can have a look (but leave this GATK ticket open so that we can track it here as well). . This will be difficult to debug without a test case that Intel can run to reproduce the issue on their end. Does the crash only occur with this one particular sample, or have you seen it on more than one sample? If you could get to the point where you can reproduce it on a shareable bam snippet, that would obviously maximize the chances of this getting fixed. Intel is currently (at our request) doing a pass on the GKL with `valgrind` to find and fix memory safety issues (https://github.com/Intel-HLS/GKL/issues/107), so we expect the next GKL release to fix a bunch of ""use after free""-type errors. Maybe they'll get lucky and fix this one as well. Timeline for the release is within the next ~2-3 months. . After that we've asked them to test the GKL with long reads data, which is also known to trigger crashes like this (https://github.com/Intel-HLS/GKL/issues/105). If the problem in your case is that you've exceeded some hardcoded length limitation, the tests on long reads data might reveal the problem.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6733#issuecomment-667189113:763,release,release,763,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6733#issuecomment-667189113,2,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"@samuelklee Because our repo is open-source, even if we hide them from the docs, users end up asking questions on them. So no to hiding any tool that is in the repo. . - More importantly, it is good to have documentation for our own selves for these tools that we use internally or legacy tools. Once a developer leaves, this is all that typically remains for the rest of us that may have to answer forum question on the code or further develop the functionality. We get questions on all ranges of tool versions and minor releases. . Even when we deprecate a tool or feature, we give people fair warning that the tool/feature will be deprecated before literally removing it from the codebase. - I understand you would rather folks drive the new car but the old clunky car model is out there on the road and is being driven by researchers right now. When they have questions, they come to the GATK forum for answers and we need to have at the least tool documentation. ; - If time is limiting, the least we should do for these legacy tools is to state within the doc that (i) folks should use another tool XYZ instead and (ii) the tool/option will be deprecated in the near future. Besides the `BETA` label, another option that will soon become available is the `Experimental` label for internal tools. @cmnbroad is implementing now. It would be great to have additional categories, but @cmnbroad says that this is as much as he has time to do for us and perhaps this is for the best because we don't want to clutter our docs with too many labels.

Just give each argument a clear prefix indicating what it applies to (eg., `--read-to-haplotype-mismatch-penalty`).

Deployability,"@samuelklee I've worked through all of the issues with the other repos (Barclay, picard, etc.), so we're ready to move forward with Java 17 reviews, but the `ModelSegments` tests are still inconsistent. This branch has updated `ModelSegments` expected result files that were produced locally with Java 17 (based on our discussion from some months ago), but now the same tests still fail on the docker. They succeed when run locally or in the CI non-docker job. At one point when I looked into these, the values produced when the tests fail look similar(/identical ?) to the values that the tests USED to produce (i.e., I suspect if we reverted expected results files, the tests might succeed on the docker and fail on the non-docker). I'm not sure what is causing the instability, but this is going to become a blocking issue for this in the next couple of weeks. We also have the option of disabling them only on the docker (or non-docker), but I hate to do that. Can you take a look at this in the next week or so ?. There is also one WDL test (`CNVSomaticPanelWorkflow.CreateReadCountPanelOfNormals`) that fails pretty consistently - I suspect this is a resource/memory issue since it sometimes returns exit code 134. The default CI machines are pitiful things, 7GB IIRC.

Deployability,"@samuelklee The module can now save and load everything, including the state of the optimizer. This allows to making interesting inference pipelines. Here's a decent strategy for obtaining the global optimum (it works flawlessly on simulated data every time):. - In the first pass, one disables annealing and obtains the variational parameters in a thermal state. The temperature needs to be _high enough_ to allow most/all local minima to merge, though, not too high to allow copy numbers to travel too far away from baseline copy numbers. If this occurs, one must anneal very slowly in the next stage (see below). The results are checkpointed once converged. - In the second pass, one makes another call to the CLI tool, this time w/ annealing enabled (starting from the same temperature) and starting from the checkpointed thermal results (model params, posteriors, adam(ax) state). The annealing rate must be slow enough to prevent thermal fluctuations from getting quenched (i.e. the evolution must be quasi-isothermal). One must look for a steady and linear rise of ELBO, such that when the annealing protocol ends, SNR quickly drops to values below 1. In both runs, the learning rate must be very small (in the rate 0.01-0.05) such that we wouldn't have to worry about controlling stochastic noise. Adam(ax) quickly adjusts its moment estimates and compensates for the small learning rate, so this doesn't increase the training time significantly.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3838#issuecomment-347369020:139,pipeline,pipelines,139,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3838#issuecomment-347369020,2,['pipeline'],['pipelines']

Deployability,"@samuelklee commented on [Mon Feb 01 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/344). Segment class that was reintroduced in the germline code requires reference to collection of Targets in constructor and also stores a call, segment mean, and number of targets. ModeledSegment (used in CNV) now extends this and adds methods to transform CR/log2CR, and in turn ACNVModeledSegment (used in ACNV) extends ModeledSegment in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/pull/329. However, this is awkward because ACNVModeledSegment does not store a call, segment mean, or number of targets. I think we decided in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/57, https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/61, https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/70, https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/71, etc. that Segments should simply query the relevant collection of Targets, especially for things like number of targets (which, correct me if I'm wrong, is only needed upon output to file), and that we should use SimpleInterval to represent a segment whenever possible. This obviates the need to update internally held fields when merging segments, etc. @LeeTL1220 @vruano @davidbenjamin we should probably get together and decide how these classes should be structured before moving them over into public. I expect that some of this will also resolve once CNV's output is more along the lines of ACNV's (i.e., when it outputs posterior summaries).",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2836:1169,update,update,1169,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2836,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"@slw287r @lbergelson Contamination estimation has two distinct goals: 1) QC to flag a bam if contamination is too high. If contamination is > 10% or even 5% the bam is pretty useless for most somatic variant calling and so we're not really concerned about getting the exact value. 2) If the contamination is low, get a precise value in order to know which low variant allele fraction calls should be filtered. In light of 1) I think the best way to fix this is to cap the estimate at 100%. It's not quantitative but at that level of contamination it doesn't really matter. By the way, a bigger problem is a we recently discovered that throws off results when there is sufficiently low coverage.

Deployability,"@sooheelee - I think that to have a proper test suite similar to GATK's 3, we need also some test that exercise some code paths that requires some specific scientifically meaningful data (for example, known indels that are also included in some sample). I am not that familiar with the test data on this or GATK3 repository, so I am not sure if that was already covered. @sooheelee - this is going to be an exact port of the indel-realignment pipeline, as it is in the GATK3 code, so that means that I won't modify the interval list format or anything (although I will use the HTSJDK/Picard classes as used on GATK3). Because this will be an experimental/beta feature, I think that I can have a look to the new format after acceptance of the original port. @cmnbroad - I understand that a fully functional tool is a requirement for acceptance, but what I mean is that some specific features might require more work than others. I am only concerned about the `NWaySAMFileWriter`, which is just an specific way of output the data but does not add anything to the real realignment process (actually, I think that I've never heard about anyone around me using it). That is a nice feature, but I don't think that it is a high-priority - I care more about having the algorithm implemented to test if the actual processing of the data works, and add support for some way of output the data in a different PR. In addition, if the people still using indel-realignment does not require the n-way output, then it is pointless to spend time on it. I was also thinking about the mate-fixing algorithm in the tool, because it can be performed afterwards with Picard, which is not constraining by any distance between reads or records in RAM - nevertheless, this is really a drop of functionality that will change results, and that's why I didn't propose that.

It's slightly more complicated because we've hit a few issues with using gatk built on java 8 in a java 11 machine.

In 95% of the use cases it will work fine on 11 if it's built on 8, but there's a few edge cases where it crashes because of weird differences in the standard libraries.

Deployability,"@tedsharpe thanks for your comments! Adding @droazen and @lbergelson for thoughts too. 1. Is it sufficient to look at the first two reads in the BAM file to determine whether the file is aligned or not? Scanning the whole file to see if it's aligned seems like overkill. I've updated this PR to look at the first two reads. Also, should we have a way of overriding these settings, to force alignment or single/paired mode? (BTW the single/paired read thing is an existing argument in BwaSpark.). 2. Is this an intrinsic problem with 2bit, or just the implementation? https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam/pull/1508 will fix the implementation (when ADAM 0.23 is out).

Deployability,"@tfenne I'm not sure we quite expect every site in the provided intervals to be covered by a variant or homeVar call. If the HaplotypeCaller deems a site to be active then it is assembled and genotyped, the `EMIT_ALL_SITES` switch is applied to the genotyper and prevents the genotyper from returning a null variant context at sites that are clearly not real variants. That does not however mean that sites that never make it to the genotyper will get returned. That means activityRegions that are not considered sufficiently active to be assembled will still not be covered in the output in `EMIT_ALL_SITES` mode. Perhaps the docs could be updated to better reflect this?

Deployability,@tfenne The gatk3 behavior when using intervals was that it only loaded data that started within the interval. We change that in gatk4 so queries get all overlapping data. This means that for GenoytpeGVCFs at least you should be getting all upstream deletions that overlap. If that's *NOT* the case then it's a bug we should fix. The side effect was getting duplicate calls in adjacent shards which is why we added `--only-output-calls-starting-in-interval`. . The HaplotypeCaller behavior is probably different and I don't know for sure what it is. ![HaplotypeCaller leading deletion behavior](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4700332/72105530-b569a080-32fb-11ea-9fc5-1adaee2ac039.png). It seems like there are 3 possible outcomes for a deletion that starts outside the interval in HaplotypeCaller. @davidbenjamin Do you know which we do? James said you were re-writing related code recently. A toggle to change between behavior 1 and 2 would be idea like you're suggesting @tfenne.

Deployability,"@vdauwera The tools are categorized and listed in the Google Spreadsheet above. It is waiting for you to assign tech leads to tools for documentation. One thing that @chandrans brought to my attention is that for BaseRecalibrator one of the parameters (`-bqsr`) actually causes an error. One can no longer generate the 2nd recalibration table with correction on the fly and instead must use the recalibrated BAM through BaseRecalibrator to generate the 2nd recal table for plotting. **This type of information is missing from the tool docs.** Furthermore, updates I made to the BQSR slidedeck (that showcase this `-bqsr` parameter) are based on information from a developer and this information turns out to be incorrect now (perhaps correct at some point in development?). Soooo, I think it may be prudent that those responsible for tool docs test the commands on data. - [4] Make sure the doc content enables Best Practices, e.g. plotting BQSR recalibration, and ; - [5] Test example commands to ensure they work.

If we can drastically reduce this cost, then we can dedicate more to increasing resolution, etc. Here is a minimal set of fixes that could enable the querying of intervals for GermlineCNVCaller (and also for DetermineGermlineContigPloidy without too much extra work, since we also subset intervals there) *only in the gCNV WGS pipeline*, without disrupting other interfaces:. 1) Write a Tribble SimpleCountCodec for the `counts.tsv` extension. I've already done this in a branch.; 2) Change GermlineCNVCaller and DetermineGermlineContigPloidy tools to accept paths.; 3) If an index is present for each count path, create a FeatureDataSource, merge the requested -L/-XL intervals, and query to perform the subset. We will also need to stream the SAM header metadata. It should not require much code to extract all this to a temporary IndexedSimpleCountCollection class. (Caveat: for now, this will work with the current gCNV convention of providing bins via -L/-XL. Technically, it will also work with the more conventional use of -L/-XL to denote contiguous regions, but we may have to perform checks that bins are not duplicated in adjacent shards if they overlap both, since querying a FeatureDataSource will return any bins that overlap the interval---rather than only those that are completely contained within it.); 4) Index read-count TSVs in the gCNV WGS pipeline after collection and modify the DetermineGermlineContigPloidy and GermlineCNVCaller tasks to take read-count paths and indices, if necessary. These changes could be confined in the gCNV WGS WDL for now. I think that should do the trick. If this is high priority, I can implement now. In the future, we might be able to promote all Locatable CNV Records to Features and write code to automatically pass the columns/encoders/de",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5716#issuecomment-468360082:532,pipeline,pipeline,532,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5716#issuecomment-468360082,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"A quick patch to help out the Variants team, which is struggling with a problematic callset. Note that a similar regularization to the effective number per component probably should have been applied to solve the issue in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6425. I'm not sure if the lack of this regularization will still lead to convergence issues, but I would hope that the fix that was implemented instead (treating vanishing components as a special case and skipping computation) suffices. As discussed there, we may also want to eventually remove the idiosyncratic finalize step; it’s likely this is the source of issues here, since the correct Bayesian M step is already regularized by the prior. The covariance regularization term added here is standard (c.f. e.g. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7e1e6d09bcc2eaeba98f7e737aac2ac782f0e5f1/sklearn/mixture/_gaussian_mixture.py#L154), but it may result in non-negligible changes to VQSLODs. As just discussed with the Variants team, we can probably use the WARP validation to convince ourselves that results are functionally equivalent. I updated the exact-match tests without much close examination (by simply forcing IntegrationTestSpec.assertEqualTextFiles to overwrite the old expected files), so someone may want to sanity check them.

Deployability,"A user rightly [points out](http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/comment/32631#Comment_32631) that different versions of HaplotypeCaller may produce GVCFs that are not directly compatible, causing weirdness when you joint-genotype them with GenotypeGVCFs. . Obviously this is primarily a data management problem (user should control what's in their pipeline) -- but it would be good to provide an additional safety layer by having GenotypeGVCFs, CombineGVCFs or whatever demon is used to invoke TileDB at least emit a WARN message if they see GVCFs produced by different versions of HC within the same input cohort. . Note that the VCF version number is not directly useable for this purpose since changes in the contents of GVCFs can arise within the same version of VCF spec. Also, one could argue that the GVCFs really should all be produced using exactly the same command line arguments -- but validating the entire command line would probably be overkill...",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2129:365,pipeline,pipeline,365,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2129,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"A while back I added a .dockstore.yml file to the gatk repo so that gatk workflows in the /script/ folder would be automatically synced in Dockstore after every push or release. This also allowed the workflows in every branch/release to be readily available in Terra.

This PR adds filters to the dockstore.yml so that only the master branch and the releases gets synced to dockstore, also any future branches aren’t automatically synced. If anyone wants to sync their branch they’ll have to add their branch name to the dockstore.yml file in their branch.; More info on dockstore yml and filters can be found [here](https://docs.dockstore.org/en/develop/getting-started/github-apps/github-apps.html)",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7217:169,release,release,169,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7217,4,['release'],"['release', 'released', 'releases']"

Deployability,"According to #2858, the new [GATK CNV pipeline](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/tree/master/scripts/cnv_wdl/somatic) is intended to replace AllelicCNV (because it now segments jointly on total copy ratio and allelic fraction). We've found the segmentation to be great for WGS data, but the new workflow does not create the same outputs as AllelicCNV - in particular, AllelicCNV generated a *-sim-final.acs.seg that could be used for [ABSOLUTE](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/absolute) and [DeTiN](https://github.com/getzlab/deTiN). We'd like to run these tools - Is there any way to get the equivalent of this file from the workflow's outputs? None of the outputs look like *-sim-final.acs.seg. . If not, I had planned to simply run AllelicCNV (or AllelicCapseg) using files from the new workflow.

Deployability,"Actually, I'm going to go ahead and add some exact match tests to guard against this sort of thing. Behavior for key somatic CNV tool modules (i.e., kernel segmentation and MCMC) is unit tested to within statistical noise (so, not exact match) on simulated data, but most integration tests just check for plumbing and not correctness. The idea was always that this sort of thing would be covered by what eventually became CARROT, since such tests would probably have to be long running and require more resources than are available in the repo to be useful. See the high priority but long dormant issues https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4122 and https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4123, as well as https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4630.

Note also that I did some work to set up transition of all existing CNV tests (also including the somatic CNV validation against TCGA SNP calls that I put together on Terra) before going on leave and moving off CNVs, but during all that, we managed to 1) lose TCGA access, 2) delete the test files on which Lee based his validation after he left, and 3) reassign at least one of the people that was going to help with the transition. Again, the resulting differences here are minor and it's unlikely that future non-CNV code changes will have similar effects, since the CNV code is relatively well encapsulated, but the exact-match checks will hopefully give us some peace of mind until CARROT tests are ready. @jonn-smith @KevinCLydon looping you in just in case you're not aware of all of this history.

Deployability,"Adding a new method `getVariantCacheLookAheadBases` to `VariantWalkerBase` which allows subclasses to set how far to look ahead when caching variants. This may help reduce memory use in GenotypeGVCFs. This also changes the side inputs to use FeatureDataSource.DEFAULT_QUERY_LOOKAHEAD_BASES which is `1000`, this is the value used by the other tools. I'm not sure if that's the right thing to do, but it makes variant walkers more consistent with other tools. Alternatively we could add a separate configuration method that lets tools change the side input value. We could also expose an optional parameter in the feature input that lets you set that on a per input basis if we need it. . This doesn't seem to have any negative effect on performance for genotypegvcfs, but it's hard to tell from short runs. It's also hard to tell if it's improving memory usage. It doesn't seem to make an appreciable difference at random places in the genome, but I'm hoping it will make a difference in very bad locations that have a lot of variation.

Deployability,"Adding in the option for using a compressed representation of our reference data. The flag use_compressed_references needs to be passed into ingest and also export, and doing so causes us to use a different internal schema for the ref_ranges table that can save ~40% on space. On the VCF path, the packed data is expanded while we populate the prepare tables before extract. On the VDS path, the packed data is expanded while we extract from the tables to create the Avro files. I updated integration tests to take use_compressed_refs as an option, and saw what I needed. Integrations tests for the VCF and VDS paths go to completion and fail, but in the expected way. AssertIdenticalOutputs, the important part, passes. AssertTableSizesAreExpected fails because the ref_ranges table is so much smaller (255884464 vs 431805033 expected) and AssertCostIsTrackedAndExpected fails because the PrepareRangesCallsetTask.GvsPrepareRanges.BigQuery Query Scanned is similarly smaller (340787200 vs 515899392). Given the nature of the change and the fact that it is an optional flag that defaults to zero, updating the integration tests to cover this path did not seem sound at this time.

Deployability,"Addresses #6242. Current behavior: when all the reads in a read group are filtered in the base recalibration step, the read group is not logged in the recal table. Then ApplyBQSR encounters these reads, can't find the read group in the recal table, and throws an error. New behavior: if `--allow-read-group` flag is set to true, then ApplyBQSR outputs the original quantities (after quantizing). . I avoided the alternative approach of collapsing (marginalizing) across the read groups, mostly because it would require a complete overhaul of the code. I also think that using recal data from other read groups might not be a good idea. In any case, using OQ should be good enough; I assume that these ""missing"" read groups are low enough quality to be filtered out and are likely to be thrown out by downstream tools. I also refactored the BQSR code, mostly to update the variable and class names to be more accurate and descriptive. For instance:.

The original SnpThenIndel workflow (used for Ultima) will be updated and moved to the WARP repo. (EDIT: I was originally confused here, the WDL that was replaced in this PR simply ran SNPs and indels separately, rather than serially. Curious that things still tied out, but I’m not sure it’s worth looking into at this point.). Test files have also been subset to chr21-22 and slimmed down.

Deployability,"Adds a new ReadWalker tool, `RealignSoftClippedReads`, that realigns soft-clipped fragments using BWA. This tool is motivated by a specific artifact produced by Illumina DRAGEN v3.7.8 in which reads containing small indels are erroneously soft-clipped, often within mobile element contexts (LINE, SINE, ALU, SVA, etc). This is particularly problematic for mobile element insertion callers such as [Scramble](https://github.com/GeneDx/scramble) that rely on soft-clips for identifying potential insertion sites but do not perform a local assembly. In some cases, these soft-clipped reads are aligned to the incorrect region (confirmed by BLAT query and comparison to BWA alignments). An example of a false positive site produced by Scramble is shown below. <img width=""1008"" alt=""Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 2 09 45 PM"" src=""https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/assets/5686877/9d2c1dfd-9673-49f0-9372-c4c9cf6ffd9f"">.

Sorry for the especially large size on this PR. **PathSeqBuildKmers tool**. Note this has been renamed from PathSeqKmerSpark. Input:; 1) Host reference FASTA; 2) False positive probability (0 create a hash set, >0 to create a Bloom filter); 3) Kmer length (1-31); 4) Kmer base indices to mask (optional). Output:; 1) Serialized kmer Hopscotch set (.hss) or Bloom filter (.bfi) file. For each reference record, the tool generates a list of long's containing the canonicalized/masked kmers. The result is a Collection<long[]> variable, which is then converted to either a PSKmerSet (Hopscotch set) or PSKmerBloomFilter, depending on the desired false positive probability. . The PSKmerSet/BloomFilter classes are basically wrappers for LargeLongHopscotchSet and LongBloomFilter, respectively. They both inherit PSKmerCollection, which provides a contains() function for querying new kmers for set membership and makes loading the kmers for filtering more convenient.

Deployability,"After experimenting with this a bit, I think using failOnVersionConflict is too inflexible. Currently, we're silently picking up newer versions of dependencies because we're relying on Gradle's default resolution strategy. But if we switch to using failOnVersionConflict, we'll have to resolve each conflict manually, and then we'll have the opposite problem: we'll silently remain pinned to older versions. I think what we really want is to fix the ""silent"" part, so that we have a mechanism that notifies us when we've introduced a change that results in a change to transitive dependency resolution, and gives us a record of which commits caused the change, without necessarily requiring us to manually pin the dependency to a particular version. I propose that we add a file to the repo containing the output of the ""dependencies"" task, and also add a Gradle task that compares that file with the current ""dependencies"" output. Anytime dependencies change, the task/build will fail, and the file diff will tell us what transitive dependencies changed.

Note that the default threshold of zero for the tumor in matched-normal mode should ensure that the sites genotyped as het should always match in the tumor and the normal. (This will ultimately make multisample segmentation, as enabled by #5524, more straightforward.) There was previously a check for this condition in the integration test; however, it wasn't actually activated by the test data.

Deployability,As part of #8083 we have added yet another heterogenous way of spitting out detailed debugging logs from yet another part of the HaplotypeCaller (namely in this case a toggle that prints to Stdout). This is in contrast to the existing (mostly assembly region position information) `--verbosity DEBUG` debug arguments and the various debug output stream arguments like `--debug-assembly-region-state`. These debug modes have proliferated and it has become difficult/confusing to know which ones are relevant if you are developing the code. . At some point it might be worth creating some sort of static debug manager class that manages the various specific output streams and saves us from having to pass debugger state to all of the various subclasses/utility methods of the HaplotypeCallerEngine. Importantly using `DEBUG` to stderr is not entirely useful as it jumbles all of the various debugger outputs into one output which quickly becomes large and difficult to read. We must support optionally splitting the output streams by functionality to files.,MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8246:168,toggle,toggle,168,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8246,1,['toggle'],['toggle']

Deployability,"As we discussed on Slack, this will fix the NaNs, but I'm not convinced that we should allow the single-contig use case without at least a warning. The ploidy step will essentially perform no inference, since I think the per-contig bias and ploidy factors will cancel out with the way the likelihood is written---it will simply return the prior, and all samples will be guaranteed to have ploidy = 2. @asmirnov239 is going to do some more testing to make sure we understand this right and perhaps add a warning/documentation.

For now, we should probably just set the appropriate runtime parameter in the clinical SV pipeline, but then at some point (maybe when we update to WDL 1.0) go back and put some more intelligent disk-size estimation into the CNV WDLs.

Deployability,"At the moment, all tests share a global Spark context. Once the test context is created, subsequent calls to `getTestSparkContext(Map<String, String> overridingProperties)` or `getSparkContext(...)` return the existing context and `overridingProperties` is ignored. This results in failure of integration tests of tools that need to override certain Spark configs (e.g. to register custom serializers). To make life a bit easier for gatk-protected devs, it is (at least) desirable to take a global set of overriding Spark config key-value pairs from within the gradle build script, and considering them when instantiating the global test Spark context.

Deployability,"Bayesian GMM:. This is essentially an exact port of the sklearn implementation, but only allowing for full covariance matrices. I think it might be good for those in the Bishop reading group to take a look during review.

This is so we can prioritize merging the IsolationForest implementation for @meganshand. We can easily add this module back when it's been reviewed separately. TODOs:. - [x] Class-level docs.; - [x] Method-level docs. I think pointers back to the original sklearn code will suffice for most methods, but I've also included some parameter descriptions. Also note that I've retained original sklearn comments throughout the implementation and have also commented on mathematical expressions where it might be helpful.; - [x] Unit tests. There's already test data (generated using Pyro) checked in and the results match the sklearn implementation to high precision, I just need to write numerical checks. There are also already unit tests for static utility methods. Future work:; - [ ] Expanding unit tests to cover more of the interface. These initial unit tests will almost certainly not completely cover the possibilities allowed by the interface, e.g. warm starts. Could be a good exercise for other developers. EDIT: At least one test of warm starts has been added.; - [ ] As mentioned in the prototyping discussion, expanding this implementation to properly include marginalization might be of future interest.

Deployability,"Broad production is finding that after running HG38 GVCFs through `GenomicsDBImport`, `GenomicsDB`, and then `GenotypeGVCFs`, the sort order of the contigs in the header is scrambled.

This is a problem, since there are tools that use the contig ordering in the header to generate contig indices used for comparison of relative contig ordering. `GatherVcfs` in Picard is one example.

There is a new `--bypass-feature-reader` option in the latest release that should help with dramatically lowering memory usage, and potentially offering a slight speedup for imports. Might be worth a shot. edit: you mentioned consolidate, so I should also add that consolidate is expected to help with read performance (shouldn't affect import) after we've had a fair number of batches imported (left intentionally vague.

Deployability,Bug on 4.0.0.0 reported on forum -- please advise how to proceed @droazen @lbergelson. ---. Ok now things are getting more interesting. Disabling intelflaters seems to solve the problem. But why?. Same flaters work with standalone picard as well and they don't have any issues. Compression level does not change anything. Is this a memory allocation error? I don't think so because it does not segfault. The error message says filename not found. . I am wondering if this has anything to do with meltdown patches. Both of my systems (Ubuntu and macOS) are patched against meltdown bug. And Intel flaters are causing this issue. But this won't explain why standalone picard is still working fine with them. The only explanation that I have is the difference between HTSJDK and GKL versions between standalone picard 2.17.2 and embedded picard 2.17.2 in gatk. The latest HTSJDK update for standalone picard mentions 2.13.1 version but the one in gatk 4.0 is 2.13.2 I believe. I don't have the info about GKL version used in them. .

The things I can think of off the bat that won't work are the optimizations for intel hardware, i.e. the fast pairhmm and deflate/inflate optimizations will definitely not work. They **should** degrade to java implementations automatically though. . IBM has a fork that works on power8 which reimplements some of the optimizations for PairHMM, so it's definitely possible to implement the various native optimizations for other architectures although not a small project. . GenomicsDB won't work since we only bundle libs for amd64/osx. You could in theory compile it yourself and pass the library on the library path. Other things that will need special attention would any of the library wrappers, for bwa-mem, fermlite, and hdf5. Those will similarly need custom builds supplied to the gatk. .

Deployability,"CTX events have CTX_PP/QQ or CTX_PQ/QP as CPX_TYPE values in GATK-SV VCFs. However, slashes are not allowed as part of enum values, so these are represented in the ComplexVariantSubtype enum as CTX_PP_QQ and CTX_PQ_QP. This caused the CTX subtypes to not be recognized and to be dropped during SVConcordance (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv/issues/664). This representation may merit further discussion, as it's not ideal that the ComplexVariantSubtype values are not a 1:1 match with the VCF values. But as one possible solution without altering the VCF, I've implemented a workaround that replaces the slash with an underscore during getComplexSubtype. I've also updated SVAnnotate to use this method, in the hopes that we can use it across all of the SV tools for more consistent behavior. I added a unit test for getComplexSubtype with one regular CPX_TYPE, one CTX subtype, and one non-CPX event. The test suites for SVCallRecord, SVCallRecordUtils, SVAnnotate, and SVConcordance all ran successfully on my branch.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8885:675,update,updated,675,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8885,1,['update'],['updated']

Perhaps there is some general VCF merging tool that would do the trick sort-of but it won't be the same as if you had run that sample with the rest thru the single sample + joint-genotyping pipeline.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7292#issuecomment-855333445:349,pipeline,pipeline,349,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7292#issuecomment-855333445,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']
Deployability,"Can you give a bit more information here? If I'm understanding correctly, it's not clear that the same issue is at play here. The original issue was that duplicate/incomplete fragments were causing queries to the workspace to fail. . In this latest instance, it seems you are appending additional samples to the existing workspace. Is that right? If so,; - are you seeing the same/similar error? That is, it's a core dump? Can you share the error messages, any logs, core dump files etc?; - did you clean up the workspace before importing? That is, remove the incomplete fragment @nalinigans identified and the duplicated ones?. My first instinct is that even if the incomplete/duplicated fragments weren't cleaned up, the incremental import shouldn't have an issue -- at least not till it gets to the consolidate phase, which only happens after all batches are imported. Sounds like you were seeing an issue at batch 3 of 4, so might have something to do with the samples in that batch...or some other import issue. You mentioned that previous imports to this particular contig failed -- were those just transient failures that worked when rerun, or was there some configuration that you changed to get that to work?. For completeness, the way I identified duplicate fragments was to do an md5sum check on some of the internal files. If any pair of fragments have the same md5sum they are likely duplicates. So, from the workspace directory, something like:. ```; find . -name ""ALT.tdb"" -exec md5sum {} \;|sort; ```; That will highlight the fragments that are potentially duplicate. To confirm that the fragments are indeed duplicates, you'll then want to take that list of potentially duplicate fragments and check that all corresponding files within each pair of potentially duplicate fragments actually have the same md5sum. I have a crude bash script that I can share if you want.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6910#issuecomment-722541707:1166,configurat,configuration,1166,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6910#issuecomment-722541707,2,['configurat'],['configuration']

I think it's also worth discussing whether we want to continue to release a rootful image, but perhaps parameterize the Docker build script to easily allow the building of an image with a non-root user. I must admit that I don't have good visibility on the various use cases of our Dockers (outside of our typical use with Terra/Cromwell), so if any users would like to chime in, that would certainly be appreciated. In particular, users may still have to do some work on their end to remap user namespaces. In any case, this is at least a proof-of-principle that mounting resources is possible within our test framework with the option for a non-root user. So unless we have other good reasons for requiring a root user, it seems worthwhile to at least allow this option, even if we don't make that the new default.

Deployability,"Closes #7884. The bug was caused by two position-only checks that should have been contig+position checks. I added a minimal regression test that uses a 2-record snippet of the test data discussed in the first post of the issue. Also discussed there is expected behavior that this fix does not induce. It seems the expectation is that a QUAL = 0 variant block should be turned into a GQ0 reference block. However, I wonder if this is not actually representative of the current (pre-fix) behavior of the tool. For example, if the test data is run only over chr13 using master, the position is not dropped (since then the position-only checks are valid). In that case, we do not see a GQ0 reference block; we instead see a GQ40 reference block, since the original record had GQ61. With the fix, we reproduce this reference block. So although we do not induce the expected GQ0 behavior, I would say the bug is fixed. Whether or not we should issue an additional fix to induce the expected GQ0 behavior is another question entirely. I'm not completely sure what the expected behavior should be from the tool or code documentation alone. Someone more familiar with this tool (@droazen perhaps you can suggest?) may have to chime in.

Deployability,"Considering that this PR has lasted through my absence and the holiday season, I want to take the chance of summarizing the concerns you have issued here:. --------. Resolved as requested (or at least made efforts to):. * documenting the logic and methods; documented. * emit VCF instead of custom file format; emit both VCF custom file format now. * bug in determining if alignment signature satisfies `allMiddleAlignmentsDisjointFromAlphaOmega`; bug fixed in commit b4f7568b03b91eb77d256bcfe8117001bce040ec. --------. Unresolved yet:; the fact that gap split happens after the alignment configuration scoring step is considered backwards. I agree in principle but due to AS and MQ were used in the scoring step, and split-copy leads to technically wrong AS & MQ, I originally decided to score first, then split. Splitting the gapped alignments was introduced originally to have a centralized logic in inferring type and location of the events. . The tension is that AS is used in the scoring but becomes practically useless after that. >> Correct, but I am having thoughts about this now (not to pick only one—that; would be wrong—but to ditch them altogether probably under some condition; and redo the alignment step), exactly because of this behavior I observe.; Think about the case where one originating gapped (say insertion); alignment, after splitting, has one of the two children contained in; another alignment (not its sibling, that's impossible) in terms of their; read span.

Deployability,"Consolidated with #2498. Now that #6885 is done, I'm going to kick off a Bayesian optimization (using the pipeline-optimizer from https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-evaluation/tree/master/pipeline-optimizer I presented on long ago) over all 3 sets of SW parameters using unfiltered HaplotypeCaller -> vcfeval F1 on NA12878 chr22 (with F1 optimized on GQ threshold and enabling decomposition of variants) as the target. This is probably not what we want to ultimately do in practice---we may want to more heavily weight sensitivity after calling, hook up variant filtering, stratify on high/low confidence regions or variant characteristics, etc.---but I'm just curious to see what happens. I see two potentially useful outcomes: 1) we demonstrate that parameters don't have much of an effect and can be consolidated, or 2) we find more optimal sets of parameters. Potentially we could also show that 3) our parameters are already optimal (I'd say this would be by pure dumb luck), in which case we could at least demonstrate and document some justification for them. If the parameters don't have much of an impact on NA12878, I'm curious to see whether this holds for low coverage or messier data---and ultimately, in malaria. Just starting with NA12878 because of the availability of truth and the potential impact for the primary use case of calling in human data. Some preliminary results: I ran the aforementioned comparison on chr22 with 1) 4.1.8.1 master and 2) 4.1.8.1 with haplotype-to-reference SW parameters changed from `NEW_SW_PARAMETERS` to `STANDARD_NGS` on two replicates of NA12878 (O1D1 and O2D2 from the 2018 NovaSeq snapshot experiment). On each replicate, 2) demonstrated slightly lower performance, but it was well within the sample-to-sample variation between these two replicates. Here are the corresponding vcfeval summaries:. ```; ::::::::::::::; NA12878/O1D1/4.1.8.1/summary.txt; ::::::::::::::; Threshold True-pos-baseline True-pos-call False-pos False-neg Precision Sen",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5564#issuecomment-710107566:106,pipeline,pipeline-optimizer,106,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5564#issuecomment-710107566,2,['pipeline'],['pipeline-optimizer']

Deployability,"Copying in some discussion about my initial, incorrect, effort in PR #2547:. David Roazen:; As discussed in person, we fully support the mission of making this class less stateful (and particularly making it so that `isVcCoveredByDeletion()` does not modify state, which was the original ticket), but we're concerned that this method `calculateOutputAlleleSubset()` was intended to be stateful, and to accumulate deletions across calls. It's also not well covered by tests, so this change could easily break the method. Can you think about this issue and reply here once you've looked into it, davidbenjamin ? Also at-mentioning ronlevine to solicit his comments, since he appears to have added `upstreamDeletionsLoc` to this class in the first place. Ron Levine; droazen Is correct. It was intended to maintain state for upstream deletions. Make sure the upstream spanning deletion does not span shard barriers, then there will be problems with the book keeping. AFAIK, shards overlap genome locations but for a large spanning deletion, the size might not be sufficient. davidbenjamin Here is the motivation for the change: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1188 and accompanying pull request, [Removed spanning deletions if the deletion was removed](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/pull/1417).

Deployability,"Copying over some discussion from Slack, with some slight modifications:. > I took a quick stab at updating the environment for gCNV. Even taking out TensorFlow (assuming that the CNN will not be supported by this environment), it's a difficult task:; > 1. The goal is to update Python from 3.6 to 3.10+, since Terra now requires the latter for officially supported images.; > 2. However, gCNV relies on the PyMC3 package. PyMC3 3.1 is currently used in GATK master. 3.1 was released in 2017, not long before our release of gCNV in 2018, but it's very old now.; > 3. The latest version of Python that is supported by PyMC3 3.1 in conda is Python 3.6.; > 4. @asmirnov239 has a draft PR (#8094) that updates PyMC3 to 3.5 and Python to 3.7, which clearly still falls short of Python 3.10+. This PR also updated some gCNV code to make it compatible with PyMC3 3.5. (It also removed TensorFlow and added PyTorch.); > 5. @asmirnov239 also merged a PR that added tests for numerical reproducibility of GermlineCNVCaller in cohort mode in #7889.; > 6. The earliest version of PyMC that supports Python 3.10+ is PyMC 4, released in 2022.; > 7. However, PyMC 4 introduces API changes, which will also require additional gCNV code changes and numerical testing.; > 8. These API changes are because the underlying computational backend for PyMC was updated from Theano (think of this as an old alternative to TensorFlow) to Aesara.; > 9. Since then, PyMC 5.9 has been released and the underlying backend has been updated again, from Aesara to PyTensor.; > 10.

Deployability,"Currently in the inversion calling stage of the SV pipeline, it is assumed that insertion and homology around identified breakpoints don't co-exist. But in theory it is possible.

Now if there's an insertion in the sample, say `AAAA`, after the homology. i.e. ```; ref1 + H + I + ref2'; ```. where a prime indicates reverse complement. Then the contig would still be mapped to the same locations on reference, but with CIGARs `59M47S` and `43M4I7M52H` (the aligner would very likely generate a `43M63H`).; The identified breakpoint should still incorporate the ambiguity introduced by the homology. ```; ref2 + I' + H' + ref1'; ```.

Deployability,"Currently spark read filters are applied to the initial reads returned from `GATKSparkTool.getReads()` via an overridable `GATKSparkTool.makeReadFilter()`. This is fine for standalone tools, but for multi-tool pipelines it creates a problem, since they must call the underlying transform for each tool instead of invoking the actual `GATKSparkTool`, and so have to handle read filtering manually for each step in the pipeline. We need a Transform abstraction that stores and applies the read filters for each tool, instead of doing this at the `GATKSparkTool` level. .

Deployability,Currently the `HaplotypeCallerIntegrationTests` cover most of the common use cases for our best practices HaplotypeCaller pipeline but are deficient in covering a few important less-used arguments. A non-exhaustive list of un-tested modes for the HaplotypeCaller that are significant enough to warrant better long term integration tests to ensure they aren't broken in the future are as follows:; - Multisample Calling Mode; - `--emit-all-sites`; - Genotype Given Alleles Mode. To complete this task would mean simply adding some new tests and possibly uploading to our LFS storage some data that appropriately covers the use case to make sure we don't accidentally break these functionalities in embarrassing ways going forwards. Some discretion might be necessary to decide what HC arguments are important enough to warrant new tests.,MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7632:122,pipeline,pipeline,122,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7632,2,"['integrat', 'pipeline']","['integration', 'pipeline']"

Deployability,"Currently there are number of boolean arguments in GATKTool that are set by default to `true`. Unfortunately, the current syntax for changing that value on the command line is to write ""--argument-name false"" (eg. `--create-output-bam-index false`) which is confusing an counterintuitive. This format made more sense for arguments when the syntax in picard/gatk3 used to be ""ARGUMENT=FALSE"". I propose that these arguments have their statements inverted wherever possible so that the user should always be negating some option that was perviously true (eg. `--disable-output-bam-index-creation` or some other alternative). Given the new argument input format this makes more intuitive sense and helps differentiate between toggle arguments and arguments with inputs on the command line without having to remember what the default value is. . A change like this would affect a number of old/bedrock arguments in the engine like, `--create-output-variant-index`, `--add-output-sam-program-record`, and `--add-output-vcf-command-line` to name a few. Since there are many arguments following this pattern perhaps the overhead from making a change like this isn't worth it. .

Deployability,"Currently this implementation could probably use more substantial testing, especially of the core functionality. It is also missing the following features from gatk3:; - Depth of coverage by fragments; - Rtable output format. The following important differences exist from gatk3:; - Fixed numerous bugs with output line ordering, now we necessarily associate the right sample with the right data in the output tables. We also sort the output samples lexicographically consistently so the order of the output columns is deterministic.; - Now gene outputs no longer rely on having exactly matching interval overlaps. Instead they are treated as intervals themselves with coverage information being collected for every exon base covered by the gene. There is an argument to demand that a gene must be completely covered by provided intervals to be in the result table. (Perhaps excising introns from coverage could be toggled?); - Intervals are no longer merged when reported in to the interval tables. . The following (new) features have been pushed into future branches:; - Diagnose targets evaluation field (need to decide what partitioning to attach it to, perhaps sample partitioning info?); - Replacement for `.refseq` format for gene lists. ; - Optional output partitioning based a provided list of read filters. .

I'm sorry it took me so long to follow up on this discussion, and I want to thank you again for reaching out to us about integrating the tool that you developed into GATK. We are certainly very interested in providing this enhancement to the research community, and we are now ready to talk about the next steps. After examining your paper and the source code in Github, we think that the most efficient way to integrate the functionality you developed would be to adapt the filtering parts of your tool to run on the output of Mutect2. So this would be a standalone tool that you would run after Mutect2, much like the current FilterMutectCalls tool. If the results are comparable to your current tool, then we would take that into the official distribution of GATK. If somehow that integration does not yield satisfactory results, then we would look at integrating the entire tool, though we're hoping it won't be necessary, so we can avoid maintaining duplicate functionality for some of the boilerplate data transformations. David @davidbenjamin can provide some advice on how to implement this in GATK4; in brief you would need to write some code that applies the filters you developed ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4632#issuecomment-404104349:931,integrat,integrating,931,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4632#issuecomment-404104349,1,['integrat'],['integrating']

Deployability,"Debugging update: the issue in this case seems to be that HaplotypeCaller constructs an additional haplotype containing a fifth variant a little bit downstream of the four called variants. The fifth variant has low read support and is not called, but matches the reference base at all of the four called positions and so is out of phase with both of the possible phase sets suggested by the four called variants. This causes the current phasing algorithm to give up, as it requires all of the haplotypes containing alternate alleles at a locus to agree with one of the phase sets it creates. . A possible solution I am exploring is to exclude haplotypes that don't have any called non-ref alleles from the set of `calledHaplotypes` passed to `AssemblyBasedCallerUtils.phaseCalls` by `HaplotypeCallerGenotypingEngine`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6845#issuecomment-712901830:10,update,update,10,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6845#issuecomment-712901830,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"Different traversal options might optimize some pipelines and give flexibility to the API user to have more efficient tools. Some of the different traversal per-pass that I am interested are:; * Allow different filters applied in each pass. Example usage: collect some metric with all reads in the first pass, and use it for the second pass only on the filtered reads.; * Allow different transformers in each pass. Example usage: in the first pass, untransformed reads are used to collect a metric; based on that metric, the second pass transform the reads to be output.; * Allow different intervals applied in each pass. Example usage: iterate over the user intervals to get some information about the reads, and then in the second pass use that information to iterate over a different set of intervals. I came out with this feature in the `TwoPassReadWalker` to implement a tool for pair-end data. The use case is to iterate in the first pass to the user intervals/filters, collecting where the mates are located (and/or read names), and in the second pass iterate over the reads and its mates independently of where they are located. If giving this flexibility to the `TwoPassReadWalker` is not desired, another option is to implement another walker-type `ReadAndMatesWalker` which implement the first pass in a private method and the second as a `ReadWalker.apply` for the reads and its mates.

This allows for input via a TSV containing the column headers `MATCH_VALUE\tMISMATCH_PENALTY\tGAP_OPEN_PENALTY\tGAP_EXTEND_PENALTY` and one row of integers. Enables investigation of #2498 and #5564.

Deployability,"Executive summary: . My main concern is that the amount of unsupported code is continuing to grow. Adding this PR would bring the total to about ~5k lines of WDL, Java, and test code. In comparison, the amount of corresponding supported CNV code clocks in around ~33k---this includes all of gCNV, as well! Development time has also been non-negligible and dates back to pre-4.0 release. Another concern is that the number of users of this unsupported code is also growing. In fact, it seems like we are actively pointing users to it. This seems unsustainable going forward. Finally, I don't think we have satisfactorily demonstrated which of the functions accomplished by this code (format conversion, post-hoc blacklisting, germline/""CNLOH"" tagging and imputation) are necessary or cannot be performed by existing code or more streamlined and principled methods. (Some of these functions, such as IGV conversion, are already performed by existing code.) Of those functions, I think format conversion is the only one we should retain from this code in an unsupported fashion. So if this PR introduces a useful GISTIC conversion, no harm in merging that. This all sounds like a decision for the new tech lead! @mwalker174 any thoughts? . More detailed responses follow:. > Users are already using this branch and giving me positive feedback (definitely more positive than adjusting num_changepoints_penalty_factor). I suggest merging mostly for practical reasons. It buys us more time to put in a principled solution. And this workflow is clearly marked as an unsupported prototype anyway (as are the GATK CLIs). I want to emphasize that this whole workflow is not a long-term solution. In other words, I would like to get this in and then focus on a supported solution. While it's great that users are giving positive feedback, I refer you to CellBender team's manifesto at https://github.com/broadinstitute/CellBender/commit/28f02f8dbd716aff922bb8da1e56da29347b245b.

Deployability,"ExtractVariantAnnotations:. This tool extracts annotations, labels, and other relevant metadata from variants (or alleles, in allele-specific mode) that do or do not overlap with specified resources. The former are considered labeled and each variant/allele can have multiple labels. The latter are considered unlabeled and can be randomly downsampled using reservoir sampling; extraction of these is optional. The outputs of the tool are HDF5 files containing the extracted data for labeled and (optional) unlabeled variant sets, as well as a sites-only VCF containing the labeled variants. This VCF can be used in ScoreVariantAnnotations to in turn specify an additional ""extracted"" label, which can be useful for indicating those sites that were actually extracted from the provided resources (since we may only extract over a subset of the genome). TODOs:; - [x] Integration tests. Putting together tests using chr1:1-10M snippets of 1) the 1kgp-50-exomes sites-only VCF for the input (since this has both non-AS and AS annotations; EDIT: Scratch that, it only has AS_InbreedingCoeff and AS_QD), 2) the Omni SNP training/truth VCF (yielding ~3.5k training), and 3) the Mills training/truth VCF (yielding ~500 training). Incidentally, VariantRecalibrator SNP and INDEL runs both fail to converge on these small training sets without the #7709 fix, but do converge with it. I still need to check if enough multiallelics are included here; if not, I'll choose a different snippet. EDITEDIT: Now using gs://broad-gotc-test-storage/joint_genotyping/exome/scientific/truth/master/gather_vcfs_high_memory/small_callset_low_threshold.vcf.gz provided by @ldgauthier, which does have AS annotations.; ; We'll use expected outputs here as inputs to downstream steps, but rather than provide the expected outputs directly, we'll create copies of them and provide those as inputs.

Deployability,"Fair points. I agree that legacy tools/versions that are part of a canonical or relatively widely used pipeline should have good documentation. However, there are many of the CNV tools that are basically prototypes---they have never been part of a pipeline, have no tutorial materials, and the chances that any external users have actually used them are probably extremely low. The sooner they are deprecated, the less the overall burden on both comms and methods---I don't think comms should need to feel protective of code or tools that developers are willing to scrap wholesale!. I'd like to cordon off or hide such tools so the program group doesn't get too cluttered---if we can do this in a way that doesn't require @cmnbroad to add more categories, that would be great. For example, we will have 5 tools that one might reasonably try to use for segmentation (PerformSegmentation, ModelSegments, PerformAlleleFractionSegmentation, PerformCopyRatioSegmentation, and PerformJointSegmentation). The first two are part of the legacy and new pipelines, respectively, but the last 3 were experimental prototypes. I think it's definitely confusing to have these 3 presented in the program group, and treating them the same as the other tools in terms of documentation is just extra work for everyone. In any case, I definitely think an additional program group to separate the legacy and new tools is warranted, since many of the updated tools in the new pipeline have very similar names to the legacy tools. If this is OK with everyone, I'll just add a ""LegacyCopyNumber"" program group, which I don't think should require extra work on anyone else's part.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3853#issuecomment-346187604:103,pipeline,pipeline,103,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3853#issuecomment-346187604,5,"['pipeline', 'update']","['pipeline', 'pipelines', 'updated']"

Deployability,"Finished refactoring the production code as detailed above, just need to add some tests. Results are exactly the same as before in single-sample mode---except for allele-fraction-only mode. This is because I refactored all existing segmenters (there were separate ones for copy-ratio-only, allele-fraction-only, and copy-ratio + allele-fraction) as special cases of a single multisample segmenter; however, the Gaussian kernel in the old allele-fraction-only segmenter was missing a normalization factor that is now present in the new multisample segmenter. Thus, users who previously ran in allele-fraction-only mode will have to retune parameters to achieve the same level of sensitivity. I expect that this will be a very small number of users (if any---note that allele-fraction-only mode isn't even exposed in the WDL), but we can probably mention it in the release notes.

Deployability,"First of all, thank you so much for your hard work! I am excited to explore GATK 4.0.0.0.; I would like to report minor issues in setting up optional dependencies for GATK4. First, `gatkcondaenv.yml` defines `gatkPythonPackageArchive.zip` location as; `build/gatkPythonPackageArchive.zip`; The path doesn't seem to work seamlessly with the release archive, though the path makes sense in the root directory of source repo. Unzipping the package file locates both files in the same directory and, to me, it is natural to create the conda environment in the directory. Second, it would be more convenient to include `install_R_packages.R` in the release like gatkcondaenv.yml for python dependencies. Also, I had an issue running `install_R_packages.R` for fresh compiled R-3.2.5. The way `install_R_packages.R` install `optparse` prevents its dependency (the getopt package) from being automatically installed, because (I guess) repos argument is set to NULL. I think the helper script needs to install the getopt package as well.; ```; optparseUrl=""http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/optparse/optparse_1.3.2.tar.gz""; if (!(""optparse"" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) {; install.packages(optparseUrl, repos=NULL, type=""source""); }; ```. Finally, it would be convenient to depend on a R version available in conda, so that R dependency can be a part of the gatk conda environment.

Deployability,"Fixes a bug that I inadvertently introduced long ago in #5408. A method there originally assumed that the intervals to be filtered coincide with the annotated intervals when filtering on annotations, but this assumption can be violated when e.g. using `-XL` to further exclude intervals. This breaks the annotation-based filtering and will result in incorrectly retained/dropped intervals. Unfortunately, the integration test cases were not quite complete enough to catch this. Fortunately, for typical data and parameters, the number of affected intervals is typically a very small percentage, especially in human (e.g., the default GC filters of [0.1, 0.9] affect <0.1% of 250bp bins); I only caught this when running on malaria data, since GC filtering has more impact there. I would also expect count-based filters to mitigate some of the effects (e.g., a bin with extreme GC that was erroneously retained when filtering on annotations might later be filtered because it has poor coverage). Downstream results are also all correct---they're just given for a slightly different set of intervals than would be expected. This bug would affect users that made use of the `blacklist_intervals_for_filter_intervals` option in the gCNV WDLs, but my feeling is this functionality is not used that frequently. @droazen I think this is a relatively minor bug, but it might be good to mention it in the release notes.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7046:409,integrat,integration,409,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7046,2,"['integrat', 'release']","['integration', 'release']"

Assuming Mutect2 handles active regions in the same manner as HaplotypeCaller, which will expand/pad active regions, then a consequence of the current workflow is potential _duplicate calls_ (that can also differ slightly from each other e.g. due to rounding) for the same genomic locus that result from expansion of the active region into the edges of the intervals being split. MergeVCFs as well as GatherVCFs, allows duplicate calls in the final VCF without checks. GatherVCFs does not allow for out-of-genomic-order-inputs and will give an error.

Because I have a tool that adds read groups with the possibility of splitting in a similar way as `SplitReads` I would like to integrate these parameters in the same tool and I can't with the current implementation.

Deployability,"From what I have heard from Dmitriy, this loss in Mutect2 precision between Mutect2 v.4.1.8.1. and v.4.1.9.0 seems to be perfectly reproducible using default parameters on the HCC1395 somatic benchmark gold-standard from the [Sequencing Quality Control Phase II Consortium](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Somatic+Mutation+Working+Group+of+Sequencing+Quality+Control+Phase+II+Consortium%5BCorporate+Author%5D). The drop in performance seems to still persist in the current Mutect2 version. If true, then this could have dramatic affects on Mutect2 clinical variant calling quality since v.4.1.9.0 until now. It would appear that isolating the root cause of this drop in performance has high importance for maintaining the clinical validity of Mutect2.

Deployability,"GATK Version 4.0.9.0. What is the issue:; When using the -OBI flag in e.g. ApplyBQSR, GATK uses an inconsistent pattern for adding index extensions. When using BAM format as output:; my_file.bam; my_file.bai. When using CRAM format as output:; my_file.cram; my_file.cram.bai. Since e.g. samtools uses the second pattern for both BAM and CRAM (well, actually they have .crai, but that is a different discssion), I think it would be sensible to adopt that schema.

However, for chr1-4, they just crash in batch 1 for very long time without any error. I have check the memory usage and there is still >35GB free memory for the compute node of each chromosome.
