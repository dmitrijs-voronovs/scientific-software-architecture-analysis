Some notable changes:; - I added a Begin for sequencing void-type IR,; - I added ArrayFor for looping over arrays (@danking); - I added a SeqOp that represents calling the RegionValueAggregator in seqOp in the IR after extracting aggregators, it holds the index of the aggregator to call seqsOp on, since there might be multiple,; - added Void literal (which I didn't end up using, but I left it in for now),; - TAggreable symbol table is no longer used in compiling the extracted aggregators.

Testability,"Prior to Kubernetes 1.24, when a `ServiceAccount` called `sa-foo` is created, a corresponding `Secret` containing a token for the service account is created call `sa-foo-token-xxxx`.

In [Kubernetes >=1.24](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md#urgent-upgrade-notes), creating a `ServiceAccount` no longer automatically creates a corresponding token secret. Our cluster auto-upgraded and PRs are failing because batch cannot find the secret field in the service account resource for SAs in test namespaces.

Testability,"Reading function/contexts from GCS on query workers can contribute a significant portion of the runtime for small jobs. For a simple query like `hl.utils.range_table(10).collect()`, the jobs in the batch can range in time from 5-9 seconds depending on GCS latency. This builds on #9484 to add write-through capability to `memory` and a `ServiceCacheableFS` in Scala. The cacheable FS reads/writes through `memory` and falls back to GCS, so in the good path the ServiceBackend writes the compiled function and contexts to `memory`, workers read inputs and write outputs exclusively from/to memory, from which the ServiceBackend reads the results. From small benchmarks in dev, this cuts down read times on the workers by ~30-40% compared to the worst case GCS latencies and roughly matches the current implementation in the best case.

Testability,"Ready for another look. I had to modify the classes some to make it work, particularly for getting the `type` out of the test. Now the type is with the Test rather than the TestResult, perhaps you see a better way?. Related notes, mostly relevant to future PRs once we have some feedback and a sense of performance:. I think LogisticRegressionNullFit should be a separate class, as it plays a conceptually and practically different role. I don't want to attach vectors of length nSamples (like mu) to each LogisticRegressionFit output, even though they would speed up the score test and first iteration of fitting per variant to not recompute them for every variant. I did put some of this efficiency in the score test (only computing the extra coordinate of score and row / column of fisher per variant). df would also then go away for LogisticRegressionFit, but I'd add the diagonal of its inverse for use in Wald (see below). The model fit function would then take a LogisticRegressionNullFit to use in the first iteration. The bigger future gains will come from not computing or inverting the Fisher matrix at all in the iteration, but rather using QR magic. val sqrtW = sqrt(mu :\* (1d - mu)); val QR = qr.reduced(X(::, _) :_ sqrtW); solve QR.R \* deltaB = QR.Q.t \* (y - mu) with R upper triangular (need to wrap lapack function). for Wald: return diagonal of inverse as well, namely diagonal of inv(R)^T \* inv(R), rather than inverting fisher again. for Score, this version of this may be faster:; val sqrtW = sqrt(mu :\* (1d - mu)); val Qty0 = qr.reduced.justQ(X(::, _) :_ sqrtW).t \* ((y - mu) :/ sqrtW); val chi2 = Qty0 dot Qty0. for Firth, modify score using:; val QQ = QR.Q :\* QR.Q; val h = sum(QQ(*, ::))",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/585#issuecomment-241153168:121,test,test,121,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/585#issuecomment-241153168,12,"['Log', 'Test', 'test']","['LogisticRegressionFit', 'LogisticRegressionNullFit', 'Test', 'TestResult', 'test']"

The first `log` statement occurs on line 98 (the line after we set the filename). I think, in my head, the Appender would be created when we initialized the Logger on line 17. That's apparently incorrect. The Appender is lazily created when some internal buffer fills and the logger flushes that buffer. That internal buffer is most likely to fill on the `log.error` lines because they dump a (large) stack trace to the log. That's why we always see the error there. The fix is simple: we track the currently desired output filename and, if we happen to create an appender *after* someone has called `changeFileInAllAppenders`, we initialize that new appender with the filename. This change ensures that, except for a short period during start up, there is always a valid filename. That short period is just the time between the JVM starting, allocating a `JVMEntryway`, calling `main` and getting to line 97. During that time, we carefully use `System.err.println` (not a logger) if something goes wrong.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13664:7,log,log,7,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13664,7,"['Log', 'log']","['Logger', 'log', 'logger']"
Testability,"Records in the job_group_inst_coll_cancellable_resources table are dead once a; job group completes. We already compact records when a job group is cancelled. ; We are yet to do this for finished job groups. See the linked issue for a more ; detailed motivation. This change adds two background tasks:; 1. finds uncompacted groups of records for finished job groups and; compacts them by summing across the token field.; 2. finds compacted records for finished job groups and deletes them if; all associated resources are 0. The results of both tasks converge to a fixed point where the only remaining; records are for those jobs groups that are unfinished, cancelled or have; resources outstanding.

Testability,"Rs into one and made major changes, so this needs a fresh look. Some high level direction:. - RegionValueAggregator is an interface that doesn't take `Any` as the seqOp argument. All of them have methods that can be called directly with the right input type. I emit code to call such methods. - TransformedRegionValueAggregator is just a little shim class that lets me override the seqOp of another aggregator with an AsmFunction4 (the result of compiling). - ZippedRegionValueAggregator just puts a bunch of RegionValueAggregators together (just foreach on the child aggregators) and puts all their results into an RV Struct. This RV Struct is referenced in the non-aggregating IR code (I've been calling the fragment that remains after aggs are removed ""stage0"" and calling aggregation ""stage1""). Passing all the aggregations directly as arguments to stage0 seems hard/impossible because the number of aggregations isn't known at scala-compile-time, but we stitch together the aggregations and the stage0 compiled IR in scala. - I added 4 IRs: AggIn (this is `gs`), AggMap, AggFilter, AggFlatMap, AggSum. I don't quite know how to add more aggregators. I think I will create new IRs for each one. Or maybe I can get a better interface. Comments welcome. - `compileAgg2` is a CPS-style compiler that lays out straight-line code that corresponds to aggregation. - The interface to generated aggregations isn't very nice right now. The user passes in a struct that contains the element and the scope values. When running an aggregator, the element is extracted first and then passed around (without the rest of the scope). References to the scope become `GetField` IRs that find the appropriate field in the argument. Using this is a bit hacky because we should mutate the fields of the scope struct as we loop over `gs` (e.g. `sa`). However, this is essentially what we do now (EvalContext is basically the scope struct), so I'm not so bothered by it.

This fixes that, and in particular, it is technically a breaking change. There are two orderings on types, the default coming from <, <=, etc. and a total ordering coming from `compare`. The default can compare ""strangely"", e.g. for Doubles every comparison with nan returns false. This code changes Set and Dict to use the total ordering on types for comparison of elements and keys. The representation of Set and Dict in Java are now SortedSet and SortedMap, which are implemented as TreeSet and TreeMap, which is always parameterized to take the total ordering.

Testability,"So I still need to sit down and actually dig through this, but my initial thoughts:. We should have shuffler tests that exercise the shuffler directly (without going through RVD/TableIR). I don't think they need to be totally comprehensive, or be necessarily independent of all hail infrastructure (e.g. encoders/decoders/types/regions, which you're using in the shuffler), but should exercise whatever the basic interface between the shuffle service and the rest of the world is going to be, independent of the specific implementation that shuffles an RVD. To that end, I'd also advocate for defining a backend-agnostic shuffler interface to shuffle TableIRs/RVDs; instead of needing to check the context flag everywhere you might shuffle something, we'd define what an RVD shuffle looks like independent of whether or not we're using the shuffle service or a Spark shuffle, and then the shuffler interface would call the correct implementation depending on what shuffler if was supposed to use. (I'm not absolutely set on the second thing happening immediately, but I do think it's longer-term the right way to think about how the shuffler plugs in, and it feels like it should be a pretty minimal change from what you have right now to get a possibly-imperfect-but-workable interface in.). In short, this feels like two+ separate PRs to me, in that it's composed of pretty distinct, substantial changes that involve a lot of non-trivial choices:; - the actual implementation of the shuffle service, and; - a client for Hail IRs to interact with the shuffle service + wiring things up to actually go through it. and I'm happy to review both pieces of it, but it might be easier + quicker to get the shuffler itself in if you broke that change out separately.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8205#issuecomment-594214674:109,test,tests,109,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8205#issuecomment-594214674,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"So I think the root issue here is the unnecessary duplication between `pyRegisterIR` and `pyRegisterIRForServiceBackend`. The only real difference is that one takes and already parsed IR, and the other takes a string and calls the parser. The callers of `pyRegisterIR` in python all call into the parser first, but I don't see any reason it has to make two calls across the python/scala bridge; I think `pyRegisterIR` should just take the IR as a string and call the parser like `pyRegisterIRForServiceBackend` does. With that change, it should be possible to make one a simple wrapper around the other (or maybe even get rid of `pyRegisterIRForServiceBackend` completely).

Testability,"So I thought we had a bug in `r_expected_het_freq` because it's documented as the ratio of observed to expected heterozygote frequency, the ratio of observed to expected heterozygote count, and the heterozygosity ratio (which I assumed must have meant the same as the first two):; https://hail.is/docs/devel/aggregators.html#hail.expr.aggregators.hardy_weinberg; https://hail.is/docs/devel/methods/genetics.html#hail.methods.variant_qc; https://hail.is/docs/devel/functions/stats.html#hail.expr.functions.hardy_weinberg_p. Also, the null dist for the HWE test is on the number of hets, so it seemed natural to report some notion of deviation between observed and expected count (or equivalently, frequency), e.g. ratio of 2.0 means there are twice as many hets as expected under HWE. So while the name `r_expected_het_freq` didn't seem ideal, I read it as ratio of observed to expected het count/freq, so changed the name to `r_obs_exp_het` and the code and tests to match the documentation. I feel pretty dense that it only now just occurred to me that it was probably supposed to mean what was in the code, that is, the expected frequency of heterozygous samples under HWE, and its the documentation that was wrong. I propose to change it back, fix the docs, and name it `het_freq_hwe`, that is, the expected frequency of het under HWE, to go with `p_value_hwe`. Does that sound reasonable?

Testability,"So I'm of two minds here, and I don't quite know which to choose. Imagine we make an internal (service to service) request. It fails with a transient error like a timeout. What do we do?. Option 1. Retry. Option 2. Return a transient error 503 service unavailable to our client, and let them to decide what to do. I've implemented both options here: request_{retry, raise}_transient_errors. Which should I use in, for example, the auth decorators which hit the auth/userinfo endpoint?. I've chosen option 1 after bouncing back and forth a few times. I feel like retrying will give a better experience in the common case (a real transient error) and both will recover eventually in the case of a real outage. It appears that browsers don't retry 503 even with Retry-After header set. I'd want it to retry immediately or after a very short delay (1s). In the end, this is what convinced me we should retry. Currently CI uses option 1 when calling batch because it is hardcoded into the batch client. The signature of these functions match aiohttp.ClientSession.request. @danking I'm compelled by your concern that we have a potentially infinite loop of failures nobody will be notified about.

Generated and internal symbols are printed with a leading colon (with no backtick quotes). Internal symbols are never visible to the user. On the Scala side, symbols are all `Sym` but there is implicit conversions from String to Sym so client code can just write strings. On the Python side, symbols are `str` or `Symbol`. I didn't change Python gen_uid to produce Generated symbols yet. I will do that in a second PR. Generally, we pass strings through the py-j boundary and parse on either side.

Testability,"Sorry, I should have explained the rationale for returning true for empty strings. I was thinking that you should be able to do something like this:; ```python; from urllib.parse import urlparse. url = ""whatever:///path/to/file""; if hl.hadoop_supports_scheme(urlparse(url).scheme):; with hl.hadoop_open(url) as f:; ...; ```. For paths without a scheme, the ParseResult's scheme is """".; ```python; from urllib.parse import urlparse. urlparse(""/path/to/file.txt"").scheme; ''; ```. > All file systems should support file:// scheme. HadoopFS is the only one that will actually work correctly if passed a `file://` URL. For example, both LocalFS and GoogleCloudStorageFS use `os.path.exists` to implement `exists`. On macOS at least, `os.path.exists(""file:///test.txt"")` looks for `test.txt` in a directory named `file:` in the current working directory, not the root directory. > I'm not sure if it makes sense for this function to return true for empty string (which I read as meaning no specified scheme, and therefore read file from local disk). I think those should maybe just be 'file'? I could be convinced it should support empty string and 'file' as inputs if you want it to work on empty string. For LocalFS and GoogleCloudStorageFS, an empty scheme will correspond to a path to a local file. For HadoopFS, an empty scheme causes Hadoop to use its configured default file system. When running Hail locally, this would be the local file system. On a Dataproc cluster, this would be HDFS. Returning true for the empty string in `HadoopFS.supports_scheme` is based on an assumption that there would always be a working default file system.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/10555#issuecomment-856148043:754,test,test,754,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/10555#issuecomment-856148043,2,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Spark 3.3.0 uses log4j2. Note the ""2"". I suspect log4j2, although it simulates the log4j1 interface, does not correctly support the log4j1 reconfiguration methods. As a result, we began losing QoB job logs. This PR embraces log4j2. The JVMEntryway is now a proper gradle project with two files: JVMEntryway.java and QoBAppender.scala. The former now more extensively logs exceptions into the job logs where they can be seen by users. `QoBAppender` and `QoBOutputStreamManager` work together to ensure QoB job logs go to a different file for each job. In log4j2 there is a log manager and there are loggers, appenders, and appender managers. The log manager appears to be a singleton manager of the log system. Within a log manager there is a directed acyclic graph of loggers. A logger accepts new log messages from user code. It adds some information (like the source class) to the message. If it has an attached appenders, it sends the message to the appenders. It then sends the message up the DAG to its parent logger. There is one root logger which is the ancestor of all other loggers. In this PR, the root logger has exactly one appender: `QoBAppender`. In Hail Query on Batch, we should always have exactly one appender, the QoBAppender, and it should be attached to the root logger. Multiple appenders can share an appender manager. Appender managers allow multiple appenders to share an output file, for example.

Add logging to JVMEntryway. JVMEntryway now logs its arguments into the QoB job log. I also log exceptions from the main thread or the cancel thread into the job log. We also flush the logs after the main thread completes, the cancel thread completes, and when the try-catch exits. This should ensure that regardless of what goes wrong (even if both threads fail to start) we at least see the arguments that the JVMEntryway received. 4. Use log4j2 programmatic reconfiguration after every job. This restores log4j2 to well enough working order that, *if you do not try to reconfigure it using log4j1 programmatic configuration*, logs will work. All old versions of Hail use log4j1 programmatic configuration. As a result, **all old versions of Hail will still have no logs**. However, new versions of Hail will log correctly even if an old version of Hail used the JVM before it. 5. `QoBAppender`. This is how we always should have done logging. A custom appender which we can flush and then redirect to a new file at our whim. I followed the log4j2 best practices for creating a new appender. All these annotations, factory methods, and managers are The Right Way, for better or worse. If we ever ban old versions of Hail from the cluster, then we can also eliminate the log4j2 reconfiguration.

(Nice work!) Parquet is gone. Not having to scan all the partitions feels so nice, and I'm just working on tiny examples on my laptop. Added RegionValueBuilder which is useful for ... building region-based values (values allocated in a MemoryBuffer). `import_vcf` uses it to produces `RegionValues`/`UnsafeRow`. I left in `UnsafeRowBuilder`, but it is not being used (except by the tests). We should port over the region => region optimization, and remove it. I feel like this could be used to write our own non-consing Parquet importer easily (that supports nested fields!) Also, our own VCF parser is now trivial to drop in, esp. for genotypes. Added UnsafeIndexedSeqAnnotation and pulling native complex types out of unsafe rows. Cleaned up read/writing VDS/KT metadata files. Got rid of `RowGenotype`, wrote `buildGenotypeExtractor` to be much better. I handled the serialization issue a slightly different way. See `BroadcastTypeTree`. Including your Kryo optimizations from unsafe-rowstore-2 would be good, too. It is still not as fast as 0.1, but generic and getting closer. This change has a lot of upside. Making things mutable now is trivial (just remove to `region.copy()` in `LoadVCF`, `ReadRowsRDD`, etc.) Tests spend a lot of time in methods that should eventually go away (e.g. `UnsafeRow.read`). The main problem is that the rowstore with naive encodings is about 4x larger (compressed) than the corresponding 0.1 VDS (profile225, 2.0GB => 7.8GB) and a huge amount of time is spent in LZ4 compression.

I think that corresponds to the parallelize for writeSplitSpecs, which is now constant (won't scale according to the number of inputs). The RDD actually doing the writing, the OriginUnionRDD, still scales linearly. I think that's inevitable unless we do the LightweightContextRVDDistributedArray thing I mentioned on Zulip since we necessarily allocate at least one RDD per input. It might still be possible to push the constants down. The point of this change is to avoid capturing the OriginUnionRDD partitions inside the map step. I did this essentially by turning OriginUnionRDD into a union with ""mapPartitionsWithOriginIndex"". I think it might be wroth trying to re-run it after this goes in.

Testability,"Stacked on: https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7440. Changes:; - start the instance with a 1-time use activation token in the metadata; - on activation, clear the activation token, send the worker the normal token and batch-gsa-key; - upgrade the worker image to -6 which has the latest cloud-sdk (v269). As far as I can tell, the metadata server is still available from within the worker container after the upgrade, so I'm not 100% sure why this change was necessary. However, it will make things easier to lock down later. I think the picture we want is:; - store the worker and batch logs in different buckets,; - the worker instance service account only has instance.delete* and object.insert on the worker log bucket,; - the service account used by the worker only has object.insert on the batch logs bucket,; - we block access to the metdata srever from within the docker containers.Leaving this for reference:. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32512597/block-docker-access-to-specific-ip. This isn't 100% trivial because the metadata server is also the DNS server. We could try blocking everything except udp/53. I think ideally, we'd put the docker containers on a different network that could only route to the outside and use a public DNS server like 8.8.8.8. *An instance doesn't need extra permissions to shut itself down, so we could just do `shutdown -h now` on the worker and have the batch driver actually delete the instance.

Testability,"Start of an IR node for joining two streams. ## Logic; Works off the ""producer"" pattern, where a stream is an object that you can; 1. Initialize, so the head of the stream is ready to be consumed.; 2. Step, so updates the current head to the next element in the stream. A join then takes two streams and its Step steps the left stream, the right stream, or both streams until a ""valid"" state is reached. E.g. In an outer join every step is a new valid state while an inner join must loop until the match condition is met. The node must also take some combining binary functions so as not to produce runtime tuples. Optional ""left"" and ""right"" functions determine at compilation time whether an unmatched pair of values should still produce a value (e.g. in a left join you always act, just either on just the left head or both). ## State of the code base; - Added `produce` abstract method to `ArrayEmitter`. Tests will fail until that is implemented on all the array nodes.; - Inserted a small hack to the `ir.ToArray` emit case that uses the producer route; - Added a test case for `ArrayJoin` (this one passes! :)); - Have not yet incorporated missingness into producer logic and have not implemented `consume` for ArrayJoin`.; - `Binds` needs to be updated to add the appropriate bindings for the children.

This is assuming we're controlling the compiler in the packaged distribution and on the cloud, we're testing representative user pipelines against gcc and clang, so the scenario you're imagining is either a Hail developer or someone who is sophisticated enough to maintain a Spark cluster (1000x worse configuration nonsense than we're arguing about here, I promise) who is either (1) running old or obscure compiler, or (2) ran into a bug that had test coverage.

Can we avoid heavily (or even moderately) templated code?

We should ship whatever compiler is best on the cloud and in the download package. That already covers a vast majority of our users. If clang is the clear winner, we can make that clear in the documentation and maybe warn about gcc it on startup. > But that becomes a problem in itself if we want the shipped compiler to work on a variety of OS'es.

Testability,"Summary of changes:; - Add S3AsyncFS which is implemented in terms of the AWS Python client library, boto3. boto3 is sync (there is an in-progress async version but I decided not to use it to start). The operations are nearly identical to GCS, except S3 supports explicit API requests for multi-part uploads (unlike GCS, where we implement it in terms of compose).; - The only tricky bit is `create`, which needs an async stream writer, but a synchronous stream reader that is passed to boto3.; - I split up test_aiogoogle.py. The GCS specific tests stay there, and AsyncFS tests move to test_fs.py.; - Add S3 to the AsyncFS and copy tests. I created an S3 bucket (hail-test-dy5rg) and test user credentials (added to K8s as test-aws-key).

Testability,"Summary of changes:; - At the end of schedule, log total time and number of jobs scheduled.; - Only log database timing if total query took >20ms.; - Make sure context_manager is cleaned up in gear.Transaction.; - Limit workers to max 250 requests/s incoming to batch driver. I used an nginx limit to do this, but it is per pod, so I turned off autoscaling and increased CPU to roughly what I saw when 100K cores was hammering against a dead driver.; - Increase the worker exponential backoff from 30s to 2m. The main thing I was trying to address was the driver getting overloaded when trying to restart with a large standing cluster. It isn't totally clear why the cluster failed in the first place. I made a few other changes to mitigate the issue before adding the nginx limit, so I'm not 100% sure which combination of changes fixed the problem:. - I put a 60s timeout on the scheduler loop. This probably isn't necessary, although the scheduler does get bogged down if many of the instances it tries to schedule on are not responding. - I put a 10s timeout on mark_job_complete. - I put a maximum of 150 active mark_job_complete requests being processed, and returned service unavailable when the max was hit. I don't think this problem is completely solved. I think we want to keep the driver in the ~80% CPU load regime where everything is being processed quickly. I think we want to back off workers if, for example, mark_job_complete is taking more than 95%ile in the not overloaded case. I'm not sure who should do this, although it could be the batch-driver if internal-gateway is doing front-line throttling. Exiting in the overload case should be very cheap. We might want to prioritize mark_job_complete over the scheduler in that case, too. @danking I'd love to get some metrics for the scheduling loop: schedules/s, jobs/s, and time once this goes in.

Testability,"Summary of changes:; - removed TStreamable; - All IR inputs must be TStream or TArray, statically; - renamed Array* nodes to be Stream* (e.g. ArrayMap to StreamMap, etc.); - ToArray, ToDict and ToSet take TStream only; - LowerArrayToStream is gone. This effectively happens in the front end. Most of the code is peppering ToArray and ToStream in the right places. I think this is a nice improvement in two ways:. I makes the IR more transparent by making ToArray, a potentially expensive operation, completely explicit. (Uses of ToArray should probably be audited.). Second, I think it cleans up the flow in Emit/Stream. Now, streams are always compiled by EmitStream, and non-stream values that correspond to EmitTriplets in the code are compiled by Emit only. Finally, I fixed a bug in array sorter that would throw an assert on sets with NaNs (compare false to themselves).

For large methods, this breaks the body of each basic block into one (or more) external functions and spills locals to fields.

Testability,"Teaches `hfs.ls('gs://bucket/')` to list the files and directories at the top-level of the bucket. In `main` that command raises because this line of `_ls_no_glob` raises:. ```python3; maybe_sb_and_t, maybe_contents = await asyncio.gather(; self._size_bytes_and_time_modified_or_none(path), ls_as_dir(); ); ```. In particular, `statfile` raises a cloud-specific, esoteric error about a malformed URL or empty object names:. ```python3; async def _size_bytes_and_time_modified_or_none(self, path: str) -> Optional[Tuple[int, float]]:; try:; # Hadoop semantics: creation time is used if the object has no notion of last modification time.; file_status = await self.afs.statfile(path); return (await file_status.size(), file_status.time_modified().timestamp()); except FileNotFoundError:; return None; ```. I decided to add a sub-class of `FileNotFoundError` which is self-describing: `IsABucketError`. I changed most methods to raise that error when given a bucket URL. The two interesting cases:. 1. `isdir`. This raises an error but I could also see this returning `True`. A bucket is like a directory whose path/name is empty. 2. `isfile`. This returns False but I could also see this raising an error. This just seems convenient, we know the bucket is not a file so we should say so. ---. Apparently `hfs.ls` had no current tests because the globbing system doesn't work with Azure https:// URLs. I fixed it to use `AsyncFSURL.with_new_path_component` which is resilient to Azure https weirdness. However, I had to change `with_new_path_component` to treat an empty path in a special way. I wanted this to hold:. ```; actual = str(afs.parse_url('gs://bucket').with_new_path_component('bar')); expected = 'gs://bucket/bar'; assert actual == expected; ```. But `with_new_path_component` interacts badly with `GoogleAsyncFSURL.__str__` to return this:. ```; 'gs://bucket//bar'; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14176:1326,test,tests,1326,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14176,2,"['assert', 'test']","['assert', 'tests']"

Testability,"Thanks @danking for helping with this, and for the nudge to finally get it implemented!. Some more next steps:; * Make a benchmarking setup to collect data on performance and accuracy. I want to use the same metrics for measuring error as [here](http://quantiles.github.io/) (Kolmogorov-Smirnov divergence and total variation distance between the true and estimated CDFs, which are both simple to compute). As a first sanity check, we should get numbers in the same ballpark as they did (worse at first, because we started with a very naive algorithm).; * Make improvements to the algorithm, evaluating the gains in the benchmarks.; * When we feel we understand the behavior of the accuracy measures, we can pick a conservative upper error bound and turn that into an automated test.; * Also once we understand the behavior of the accuracy measures, figure out how to communicate that to users. One thought is to offer a few default choices of parameters, and for each document memory usage, empirical error from our benchmarks, and a theoretical upper bound on the error (of the form ""with probability > .99 the estimated q quantile element will have true quantile q ± .001""). This allows users to make an informed decision based on their use case. That looks like a lot, but I think those are all relatively simple.

Testability,"Thanks @jmarshall for bringing this to our attention. It looks like while we updated the upper bound here, we did not update our fully-pinned requirements which we use to test in CI, so it did not catch this incompatibility. That being said, I don't think that was necessarily a mistake, because by testing our minimum-compatible-version we make sure not to introduce incompatibilities on that end of the spectrum either.. I think I don't see a good way in which we can confidently support more than one major version of a dependency at a given point in time.

Looks like we erroneously assume we can decode job logs as utf-8 strings on the worker and [invalid utf-8 strings such as '\\x80'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59624160/how-many-bytes-does-the-python-string-x80-in-utf8-occupy) cause writing the log or fetching it from the worker to fail. I made a branch with a couple small changes to be more careful about utf-8 decoding and was able to successfully see the log from the example you gave here. Now just need to make a backwards-compatible change to how we ship job logs around. Fix should be out soon!,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/12614#issuecomment-1402163573:89,log,logs,89,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/12614#issuecomment-1402163573,4,['log'],"['log', 'logs']"

So I think a sub-DAG won't always be orders of magnitude smaller than the full DAG, so that won't necessarily make the critical difference. Short-circuiting the `add_dependents()` recursion on paths that have already been seen made the full DAG computation take <1 second.

Testability,"Thanks for working on this!. Would it be possible to keep the logout button on every page but add a step where it takes the user to the Auth UI to make it work? Specifically, I'm thinking we could add logic to the `/user` route in `auth/auth/auth.py` such that if we pass in the query parameter `logout`, it calls the same code as the `/logout` endpoint, and then replace the `form` and `button` with something like:. ```html; <a href=""https://auth.hail.is/user?logout"">Log out</a>; ```. The tricky part of that might be getting the CSRF token, but since the `/user` page is only accessible by logged in users (because of the `authenticated_users_only` decorator), I *think* there should always be a CSRF token accessible via `request.cookies[""_csrf""]` (e.g. https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/main/web_common/web_common/web_common.py#L93).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14639#issuecomment-2258267657:62,log,logout,62,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14639#issuecomment-2258267657,7,"['Log', 'log']","['Log', 'logged', 'logic', 'logout']"

Testability,The GCP terraform got into a bit of an invalid state during an ambitious but ultimately fragmented migration I was trying to make to modularize the terraform code. The `sql_config` module assumed by the terraform code no longer exists (!) and I've reinstated the database server config resource for the time being until the GCP terraform code is ready to use the new `infra/k8s` module. This also includes the following fixes/cleanup:. - A GSA key/secret for grafana that is required for grafana/create_accounts to work correctly; - Deleting resources related to the `gcr_pull` service account that no longer exists since it isn't used in our codebase.; - Added the cluster role/binding for batch that it needs to use to access developer/test namespaces. This will become relevant soon when I introduce the rest of the changes from #10866 that I now intend to do more gradually.

Testability,"The IR has functions so that we don't need a node for every bespoke library function we might want to call out to. There are three types of functions: Relational functions, IR functions, and Code functions. Relational functions take Tables/MatrixTables as arguments. I haven't touched these. IR functions are essentially aliases for IR patterns we expect to be common, and don't necessarily want to inline everywhere. Example: Array median:. ```scala; registerIR(""median"", TArray(tnum(""T"")), tv(""T"")) { array =>; val t = -array.typ.asInstanceOf[TArray].elementType; val v = Ref(genUID(), t); val a = Ref(genUID(), TArray(t)); val size = Ref(genUID(), TInt32()); val lastIdx = size - 1; val midIdx = lastIdx.floorDiv(2); def ref(i: IR) = ArrayRef(a, i); def div(a: IR, b: IR): IR = ApplyBinaryPrimOp(BinaryOp.defaultDivideOp(t), a, b). Let(a.name, ArraySort(ArrayFilter(array, v.name, !IsNA(v))),; If(IsNA(a),; NA(t),; Let(size.name,; ArrayLen(a),; If(size.ceq(0),; NA(t),; If(invoke(""%"", size, 2).cne(0),; ref(midIdx), // odd number of non-missing elements; div(ref(midIdx) + ref(midIdx + 1), Cast(2, t))))))); }; ```. Code functions are functions where we have a handwritten code-generator (not IR). Example: Fisher Exact Test:. ```scala. registerCode(""fisher_exact_test"", TInt32(), TInt32(), TInt32(), TInt32(), fetStruct){ case (r, a, b, c, d) =>; val res = r.mb.newLocal[Array[Double]]; val srvb = new StagedRegionValueBuilder(r, fetStruct.physicalType); Code(; res := Code.invokeScalaObject[Int, Int, Int, Int, Array[Double]](statsPackageClass, ""fisherExactTest"", a, b, c, d),; srvb.start(),; srvb.addDouble(res(0)),; srvb.advance(),; srvb.addDouble(res(1)),; srvb.advance(),; srvb.addDouble(res(2)),; srvb.advance(),; srvb.addDouble(res(3)),; srvb.advance(),; srvb.offset; ); }; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6540#issuecomment-508089671:1223,Test,Test,1223,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6540#issuecomment-508089671,1,['Test'],['Test']

The rest of the complexity of this PR is figuring out how to communicate those logs over the Batch API in a backwards-compatible and straight-forward way. What makes that tricky is that when we say ""job log"" in the code we mostly talk about a dictionary or JSON object of container to log string. Valid JSON must be UTF-8, so JSON starts to make less and less sense for sending log files.

Testability,"The current implementation of `Container.delete`,; ```python; async def delete(self):; log.info(f'deleting {self}'); self.deleted_event.set(); await self.delete_container(); ```. provokes a race between the `run` task and the `delete` task. The former sees the `deleted_event`, raises and jumps to `delete_container`, so both tasks might be trying to delete the container at the same time. This races here,; ```python; if self.container_is_running():; try:; log.info(f'{self} container is still running, killing crun process'); self.process.terminate(); self.process = None; await check_exec_output('crun', 'kill', '--all', self.container_name, 'SIGTERM'); except asyncio.CancelledError:; raise; except Exception:; log.exception('while deleting container', exc_info=True). ```; where we might queue two `crun kill` calls, the second of which fails because it cannot find any such container. Calling `delete_container` from within the `delete` method is a remnant from an older implementation of deletion, before we used `deleted_event` to explicitly signal to the `run` task that it's time to wrap things up. This is no longer necessary. The simplified way to think about deletion now is:. - Calling `Container.delete` just sets an `asyncio.Event` that the container has been deleted.; - Anything in the `run` task of the container that can be interrupted by a deletion waits on that event and short circuits the run process if it is set.; - The `run` task is the only task that calls `delete_container`, and always calls it when it is done.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/10714:87,log,log,87,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/10714,3,['log'],['log']

Testability,"The current logic of `key_by` and `distinct` to remove duplicate pairs is actually not properly deduplicating pairs in some cases. Since I know that thats not really the approach we want in the long run I didn't bother figuring out why, and instead tried implementing a version of the code that filters out duplicate pairs before exploding, which should result in less work overall. However, I somehow introduced an extra `Ordering unsorted dataset with network shuffle` and the overall performance of that search got slower by 15 seconds. . Here is the change I made. Let me know if you have a better approach for filtering out duplicates, or if you see any ways to reorganize this code to make it less shuffle-y; https://github.com/broadinstitute/seqr/commit/2e45403efc159b58cec723f86e6de7653d64cf5f",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13882#issuecomment-1828333357:12,log,logic,12,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13882#issuecomment-1828333357,1,['log'],['logic']

When I added it, I figured any lets being lifted from below should be able to lift all the way to the destination of this node, and I hadn't thought carefully through what would happen if that assumption weren't true. The example that breaks that assumption is when some expression `x` is used as the top level of a branch of an if, or any other spot that prevents lets from being lifted any higher, while also being used >1 times elsewhere, and `x` also contains a repeated subexpression. The other uses of `x` will be lifted out somewhere above, so `x` gets marked as being lifted. The use in the if cannot be lifted, and moreover is the destination of the lifted repeated subexpression, so `x` gets marked as being a destination. It's still true that the uses being lifted are disjoint from the uses which are destinations, but there is only one object in memory.

Testability,"The goal of this PR is to have all of the JVM container logs available where all the worker logs are. I tagged the entries with ""worker.log"" so they show up with the other worker log entries. However, it's plain text with no timestamp. We can improve the formatting as a separate project. Notice the two entries with ""*"" on the left instead of the normal ""I"". The design choice I made is to have the JVM containers write to a location that is static. We cannot easily change the fluentd configuration dynamically. It requires restarting the daemon which takes 1.5 seconds. Furthermore, the configuration for fluentd is on /etc/ on the host which the batch worker container cannot access. Hence, why I took the approach of specifying it in the startup script at known locations. .

Testability,"The issue is we start billing for instances as soon as they're created with the API. However, if an instance is stuck in provisioning and never activates, we never update the start billing time to account for the lack of resource. This PR uses the `lastStartTimestamp` in the [Google REST API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/get). This value is in RFC3339 format. I think this is the same format the timestamp in the activity logs, so I copied how we parse that value. If we delete the instance due to activation timeout, then we set the attempt start time to NULL so it's not billed. I couldn't find good documentation on this, but it seems like the `lastStartTimestamp` approximates what we care about for the purposes of checking for stuck workers. I checked it on an instance that was provisioning and the value was missing. Once the instance was in starting, the value was about 10 seconds after the `creationTimestamp`. . QUESTION: This does raise a question on whether we should be using the `lastStartTimestamp` when billing users if the difference is around 10 seconds. That will be a harder change, but is probably doable. We can't access the `lastStartTimestamp` through the metadata on the worker which would have been the easiest solution. We can get the compute client on the worker and access the `lastStartTimestamp` that way and set the job start time to the instance start time. I'd need to change the database for the attempts trigger to account for this. For the scenario where a job private job is cancelled while creating the instance, we would either need to make the additional API call or we just leave the time we created the instance.

Testability,"The only noticeable change after this PR is that devs will be able to access `internal.hail.is/<PR-namespace>/<service>` while it is running and see jobs submitted by tests. Well, that and you can add another developer to a dev namespace as a developer without destroying the developer's existing namespace. Subsequent PRs will introduce on-demand dev namespaces and the ability to suspend the deletion of a test namespace. New context added to the CI pipeline is treated as optional to be backward compatible with the current CI. So devs won't be able to log in to test namespaces on *this* PR but will be able to once this PR becomes main. ### What has changed; - All developers from default are now added to all test namespaces using the `add_users` build.yaml step and removed at the end of the PR run through the `delete_users` step. These use the normal create and delete API instead of copying the user's gsa from the production namespace. This relies on / tests that the delete user endpoint is properly deleting cloud identities when the users are deleted (previously broken in GCP but fixed in this PR.; - The developer role no longer implicitly deletes and recreates a corresponding namespace. I wanted adding developers to test namespaces not to have side-effects that leaked out of the namespace. A follow-up PR will incorporate the ability for a developer to request an on-demand dev namespace, which should be made a lot easier after these changes. I think this also means that we can remove some permissions from the auth K8s ServiceAccount since it no longer needs the ability to create and delete namespaces.; - A fixed-but-sufficient number of oauth2 callbacks are hard-coded into the oauth2 secret from GCP/azure and then allocated to a given namespace.

Testability,"The original goal of this PR was avoiding `Try` when we are not using the restartability provided by semantic hashing because I strongly suspect it is related to the loss of stacktraces in exceptions. Unrelatedly, we realized the semantic hash PR changed the semantics of Query-on-Spark even when semantic hash is disabled: previously we would abort RDD writing on the first exception. In Hail 0.2.123 through 0.2.126, the semantics were changed to only crash *after* we already ran every other partition. Two bad scenarios of which I can think:. 1. Suppose the first partition fails due to OOM. We now waste time/money on the rest of the partitions even though we cannot possibly get a valid output. 2. Suppose every partition hits a permission error. Users should get that feedback after paying for O(1) partitions run, not O(N). I created two Backend paths: the normal `parallelizeAndComputeWithIndex` with its pre-0.2.123 semantics as well as `parallelizeAndComputeWithIndexReturnAllErrors` which, as the name says, returns errors instead of raising them. While making this change, I think I found two other bugs in the ""return all errors"" path, only one of which I addressed in this PR:. 1. I'm pretty sure semantic-hash-enabled QoB batch submission is broken because it uses the logical partition ids as job indices. Suppose there are 10,000 partitions, but we only need to compute 1, 100, and 1543. 0.2.126 would try to submit a batch of size 3 but whose job indices are 1, 100, and 1543. 2. Likewise, the Query-on-Spark path returns an invalid `SparkTaskContext.partitionId` which, at best, produces confusing partition filenames. I only fixed the former because it was simple to fix. I wasn't exactly sure what to do about the latter. We should fix that separately because the changes in this PR need to urgently land in the next release to avoid unexpected cost when one partition fails.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14085:1285,log,logical,1285,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14085,1,['log'],['logical']

But when I added `h_sq_standard_error` above them, it introduced a very subtle bug by calling `compute_neg_log_lkhd` at a value `1e-4` to the right of the fit `log_gamma`. This caused both the scala and python routes to use the value of `self._residual_sq` at `log_gamma` but the value of `self._d_alt` and the rest at `log_gamma + 1e-4`.

Testability,"The problem I saw was this:. ToStream's invariant is that its children must be TIterable. Given this invariant, in boundary it is not safe to call ToArray on streamified when streamified.isInstanceOf[TStream] and node.typ.isInstanceOf[TArray], because this will miss cases (potentially) when node is a different TIterable, and likewise it is not safe to call ToArray on streamified when node.typ.isInstanceOf[TIterable], because we may inadvertently cast a non-array TIterable to TArray, and thereby break boundary's type invariance. So everywhere that we add a ToStream, we need to perform a check on the child: if it's a non-TArray TIterable, return it, else wrap in ToArray, unless we can be sure we never perform said wrap on a TIterable when streamify is called from boundary. . In the latest commit, I simplified the toStream code, and improved the type check to check not TContainer, but (TIterable && !TStream). This is more precise that checking TContainer alone. That being said I haven't created a convincing test yet (though it's trivially easy to make *a* test: pass a ToStream wrapping a node with typ TDict to boundary, with the old check on boundary, and a TIterable check-before-wrap-in-ToStream in the base case of streamify).

We recently; discovered an issue that would lead to a runtime exception if the; following conditions held:. * An offset pair ended exactly on a block boundary.; * The block boundary was exactly the start of a line. In a blocked file with virtual offsets, there are two ways to point to; the start of every block, (previous block start offset, previous block size) or; (current block start offset, 0). Because of the way curOff is calculated in TabixLineIterator, this would; lead to a situation where curOff was the (previous block start offset, previous block size); value, causing the jump to next chunk comparision `!TbiOrd.less64(curOff, offsets(i)._2)`; to fail when it should succeed, causing an extra line to be read, which; then makes the assertion check in the next iteration. The key invariant of TabixLineIterator must be to keep bufferCursor; inside the block currently being read.

Testability,"There are many things wrong here. The Hadoop configuration is not copied per HadoopRDD operation.

This is compounded by the fact that SparkContext.hadoopFile is not invoked until TableIR.execute is run making HailContext.forceBGZ() completely ineffective. One option is turning on spark.hadoop.cloneConf, that appears to clone the Hadoop configuration (to avoid some multithreading issues) although the docs don't recommend it due to ""performance regressions"". I haven't tested it. The other option is stop using the Hadoop stuff so we can pass state into the file loaders.

Testability,"There are three ways to represent a homogenous set of named values of type `T`.; 1. an `array<T>` and a `dict<str, int>`, the values are stored in the array and the names are stored in a separate dictionary mapping names to their indices; 2. a `dict<str, T>`, the name-value pairs are stored as dictionary key-value pairs; 3. a `struct{name1: T, name2: T, ... nameN: T}`, the name-value pairs are stored as field name, field string pairs. The third option is the most space efficient: the type stores the field names and there is no bookkeeping overhead per-set-of-named-values. The first two options repeat the field names for each occurrence (in particular, consider a Table field or MatrixTable entry-indexed field). The first two options needlessly encode the length (which is statically known). The third option is the most access-time-efficient: the offset of any named-value is known at hail compile time. The first two options require a logarithmic search of hail's dictionary tree representation. The third option is more user-friendly for accessing: `x.name`. The first is the least user-friendly: `x[indices[""name""]]`. The first and third options are the most cache-friendly for homogenous operations. The first uses `ArrayExpression.map`, so code size is `O(CODE)`. The third option's code size is `O(CODE * #VALUES)` because structs have no `map`-like primitive. The third option is also not user-friendly for homogenous operations (the user must repeat the code for each name-value pair). The third is the most self-documenting option. The number of fields and their names are visible in `ds.describe()`. The first is the next best because the dictionary is likely a global field that can be viewed with `x.indices.show()`. ---. ## Phase 1; Implement a new virtual type `tstaticdict<T, name1, name2, ..., nameN>` who's physical type is `PStruct` with N fields.

Testability,"There is no hail operation that removes keys and guarantees no change to order (see https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/6929).

In particular:; - `order_by(*ds.row_key)` does not guarantee that entries from the same row are appear in the order of the corresponding columns; - `order_by(*ds.row_key)` does not guarantee that entries from a pair of rows with equivalent keys appear in the order of the corresponding rows.

This resolved some latent bugs that arise from mixing Hail's (In|Out)putBuffers with operations on the underlying streams. Encoders and Decoders appear to have no issue being interleaved with Buffer operations, so I now freely use the buffer of the (En|De)coder as is convenient.; - get now accepts inclusivity flags for both start and end (this was critical to use partition bounds correctly).; - implement partitionBounds.; - add a `close` to `ShuffleClient` so it can clean up ExecuteContext and the socket.; - the server and client now handshake (each sends and receives one byte) on a close so as to raise errors sooner if either one of them did not expect the conversation to end.; - KeyedCodecSpec => ShuffleCodecSpec, changed to support the all-etypes, no-codec-specs methodology.; - shrink uuid to 32 bytes, still a lot, but fits on one log line.; - implement a *whole pile* of write/read methods on `Wire.scala` that give a unified language to our mess of serializers and deserializers.

Testability,"This PR adds `utils/StackSafe.scala`, which contains generic tools for writing stack safe code. To illustrate its use, I've converted `NormalizeNames` and `RewriteBottomUp` to be stack safe. This approach optimizes for the minimal possible change to existing code to make it stack safe. I originally expected this to have mediocre performance, and designed this to have optimization opportunities--requiring more substantial rewrites--where we found it was necessary. In a follow up PR, I converted the IR parser to be stack safe. In benchmarking that, I'm not able to see any performance penalty (if anything, the stack safe version looks slightly faster, which is probably just noise). So it's possible this will perform well enough as is, but we can keep an eye on it as we convert more passes. The basic idea is to rewrite functions that can be called recursively (directly or indirectly through a path of mutually recursive functions) from `f: (...) => A` to `f: (...) => StackFrame[A]`. Where the former evaluates, executing all recursive calls, and then returns the `A` result, the later returns a description of the work to be done before making any recursive calls. The method `StackFrame[A].run(): A` executes that description in a non-recursive loop. `StackFrame` is a monad, implementing `map` and `flatMap`, which allows the `for` syntactic sugar to be used. When a method makes several recursive calls, this can be significantly more readable. The public api is small. There are the free functions; ```scala; def done[A](result: A): StackFrame[A]; def call[A](body: => StackFrame[A]): StackFrame[A]; ```; and the methods; ```scala; abstract class StackFrame[A] {; def flatMap[B](f: A => StackFrame[B]): StackFrame[B]; def map[B](f: A => B): StackFrame[B] = flatMap(a => Done(f(a))); def run(): A; }; ```; `done` is basically the return statement. `call` is very important: it wraps a recursive call in a thunk, so that returning a `StackFrame` doesn't require descending all the way to t",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9320:534,benchmark,benchmarking,534,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9320,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarking']

The latter just wraps a `Stream` from EmitStream.scala, but eventually these should be unified. I also added `PCanonicalStream`, mostly for consistency with the rest of the `PType` hierarchy. If you think the added noise isn't worth the consistency, I can get rid of the abstract classes.; * I added assertions to `TypeCheck` for all cases I could think of where a node could take a child of any type, but now will only work for realizable types.; * To support nested streams in the emitter, we need to be able to bind streams in the environment, e.g. to map over stream of streams. The easiest way I could see to enable this was to keep the environment an `Env[EmitValue]`, but to allow `EmitValue`s of unrealizable types.

Testability,"This PR adds support for Azure SAS tokens in QoB. A SAS token is basically a blob storage URI with a short-lived credential to access that resource appended as a URL query string. In such a scenario where the FS receives a blob URI with a SAS token, that token should be used instead of the latent credentials on the system. Most of the changes to the `AzureStorageFS.scala` are to parse out a SAS token from blob names. This change brings with it a couple caveats. Unfortunately it is not possible to truly disambiguate a SAS token from a glob pattern, or even just a normal blob filename. So we take what is probably a safe assumption and look to see if there exists a query-parameter style key-value pair after the last `?` in the blob name. If this is the case, we treat everything after the last `?` as a SAS token. If this condition is not satsified, we say there is no SAS token and treat the whole path as the blob name. This logic already exists in python, but I'm open to alternatives. Introducing SAS tokens also breaks the way globbing is currently implemented, where it is deemed safe to iteratively append components to the end of a blob URI string. I added an abstract type member to `FS` and instead of a `String` have `globWithPrefix` accept that associated URL type that can properly handle path updates. I'm unclear on the best way to do this w.r.t. the type system, and wasn't quite sure what to put as the associated type for `RouterFS`, which ideally would accept a union of the URL types for the filesystems that it wraps, so some guidance on that would be great if you have any.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13178:934,log,logic,934,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13178,1,['log'],['logic']

A couple of nuances in the implementation came up that I also tried to articulate in the RFC:; 1. A root job group with ID = 0 does not belong to an update (""update_id"" IS NULL). This means that any checks that look for ""committed"" job groups need to do `(batch_updates.committed OR job_groups.job_group_id = %s)` where ""%s"" is the ROOT_JOB_GROUP_ID.; 2. When job groups are cancelled, only the specific job group that was cancelled is inserted into `job_groups_cancelled`. This table does **NOT** contain all transitive job groups that were also cancelled indirectly. The reason for this is we cannot guarantee that a user wouldn't have millions of job groups and we can't insert millions of records inside a single SQL stored procedure. Now, any query on the driver / front_end must look up the tree and see if any parent has been cancelled. This code looks similar to the code below [1].; 3. There used to be `DELETE FROM` statements in `commit_batch_update` and `commit_batch` that cleaned up old records that were no longer used in `job_group_inst_coll_cancellable_resources` and `job_groups_inst_coll_staging`.

Testability,"This PR brings the `Streamify` pass back to the JVM emitter. Streamify is useful because it make explicit *in the structure of the IR*, which nodes are stream producers and which nodes are stream consumers. In particular, the following nodes **produce** streams:; ```; ReadPartition; MakeStream; StreamRange; ToStream. ArrayMap; ArrayFilter; ArrayFlatMap; ArrayScan; ArrayAggScan; ArrayLeftJoinDistinct. Let /* sometimes */; ```; And the following nodes **consume** streams (`#` indicates which arguments are streams):; ```; ToArray(#); ToDict(#); ToSet(#); GroupByKey(#) ; ArraySort(#, -, -, -); ArrayFold(#, -, -, -, -); ArrayFold2(#, -, -, -, -); ArrayFor(#, -, -); ArrayAgg(#, -, -); CollectDistributedArray(#, -, -, -, -).

Testability,"This PR changes the semantics of TableMapRows in the IR and Table.select. They are now required to preserve the key ordering. In other words, applying TableMapRows to an ordered table can produce an ordered table without shuffling. I put an assert to verify that the produced OrderedRVD is really ordered, but that might be too expensive an assertion. Before, `newKey = None` meant ""keep the old key"", but that left no room to ask for the result to be unkeyed. Now `newKey` is just the key of the resulting table. If any partition key fields are modified, then even if the ordering is preserved, the result will need to be scanned to update the partition bounds. To avoid this scan when unnecessary, I added the `preservedKeyFields` parameter, which is the length of the prefix of key fields which are not modified. Thus, if the number of partition keys of the underlying OrderedRVD is less than or equal to `preservedKeyFields`, the partition bounds will remain valid. This feels pretty clunky, and I welcome better ideas. In particular, is there a way to compute this from the `newRow` IR?

For `deactivate`, the return code will be non-zero only if the instance is inactive or deleted. I thought about making the in-memory state match the state in the database explicitly, but I think it's safer to keep the current behavior where the in-memory state is ""inactive"". The state will be fixed to deleted when the callers of deactivate eventually call `mark_deleted`. Likewise, `mark_deleted` expects the state to be inactive.

After this PR, a tweaked version of `NDArrayEmitter2` has become the new `NDArrayEmitter`. `outputElement` now returns a `PCode`, and all the missingness problems are handled by carrying a `IEmitCodeGen[NDArrayEmitter]` around throughout the deforesting process, meaning the `NDArrayEmitter` no longer needs internal state about missingness. .

Testability,"This adds `partitionKeys` which partitions the keys into partitions containing as-near-to-equal-as-possible number of records. The partitions are represented by an array, `pb`, of keys of length `nPartitions + 1`. The partitions are taken to include records with keys in; ```; [pb(0), pb(1)); [pb(1), pb(2)); ...; [pb(nPartitions-1), pb(nPartitions)]; ```; Note that the last partition is inclusive of both end-points. I have two simple examples of the partitioning behavior at the top of `LSMSuite`. In these cases, the number of elements is so small that the LSM perfectly stored the distribution, so there is no approximation. `LSMSuite` also contains tests that use enough keys so as to force the LSM to not keep them all. When the LSM has more than 10,000 keys, it starts sampling. It flips a coin that is true with probability `10,000 / n_keys_seen`. As we see more keys, the probability that the next seen key is kept decreases. If we decide to keep a key, we uniformly randomly choose a key to evict. The above is not entirely true. In reality, we keep 9998 keys in an array and separately keep the greatest and the least. Those are the true greatest seen key and the true least seen key. The probabilities above are adjusted accordingly. If the sample of keys is unbiased, then we expect the partitions chosen to be roughly equal in number of records. ---. The TestNG changes are already in another PR, I'll rebase when that lands. I separately fixed a bug in KeyedCodecSpec wherein it incorrectly assumed the Key and Value types were the same. I also fixed a bug in that the LSM used non-thread-local regions. Regions are not thread safe and the Indeed LSM implementation uses many threads.

Testability,"This adds filter, filterCols, and filterRows to BlockMatrix, en route to moving kinship and LD matrix to from IRM to BlockMatrix. For example, filtering out rows/columns from a kinship matrix (e.g. to remove samples with missing covariate data); or filtering an LD matrix (e.g. to perform Leave-One-Chromosome-Out LMM analysis). Since the number of tasks equals the number of resulting partitions (blocks), these functions are suited to filtering out a small to medium subset (say, throwing out a few rows and columns, or half of the rows and columns) and may fail when filtering all but a small number of rows and columns due to all the blocks being sent to one executor. In the latter case, one can do better by writing the result of filterCols, then reading and applying filterRows. Testing locally, on a 16384 * 16384 matrix (block size 4096, 16 partitions, 128MB each), when only filtering columns (or rows), filterCols (or filterRows) tends to be faster than filter (likely due to less copying), and filterCols tends to be a bit faster than filterRows (which I think is due to lack of transpose and esp. better striding). When filtering both columns and rows, filter tends to be fastest but filter_columns followed by filter_rows is often comparable. It may be that the cost of an additional copy in the first step is offset by smaller strides resulting better caching in the second step. For example, filtering out every 31st row and column:; ```; filter; [9.550655126571655, 9.62321400642395]; filterCols.filterRows; [12.190248966217041, 12.07064700126648]; filterRows.filterCols; [14.239542007446289, 15.601837158203125]; ```; Filtering out every row and column with 0.5 probability, resulting in 4 partitions:; ```; filter; [4.625396966934204, 4.427164077758789, 4.435616970062256]; filterCols.filterRows; [4.647814035415649, 4.610292911529541, 4.655405044555664]; filterRows.filterCols; [4.866307973861694, 5.073392868041992, 5.470307111740112]; ```.

It also many roles to the test account that the batch account has so that we can run PR and test namespaces (internal batch instances use the test account for all the services so the test account needs tons of privilege. It looks scary, but this is the model we currently have). Thanks to #11053, which is the current version of the CI deployment in Azure, this required no change to the CI application code. ### Sidebar; It might look weird that I've added a block here for the kubernetes provider. That is because up until now I've kept all the k8s and azure terraform in separate root modules, so that they need to be `terraform apply`'d separately and therefore their provider blocks were separated as well. While keeping the code isolated is good (the k8s modules can be reused for GCP), putting them in separate apply's was purely because of [this bug](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-kubernetes/issues/1028) in the kubernetes provider. I ran into it when experimenting tearing clusters down and putting them back up again. However, it has since proven very cumbersome to manage two different terraform states where one relies heavily on the other and I've changed my mind. The bug in question has a PR forthcoming and is really only a problem when tearing a K8s cluster down and rebuilding it while preserving other terraform state, which isn't something I see us dealing with often past initial development. Thus, I've added the k8s provider block so that I can directly invoke the CI k8s module. I'll follow up with a PR that moves the other k8s module invocations in here as well.

Testability,"This also fixes the currently broken `delete_*_tables` steps. In the past, all dev and test databases shared the same MySQL Server (with production), so instead of each service getting its own dedicated database, there was one database per dev/test namespace with all the tables for all the services. This made it difficult to reset the database state of a particular service -- you needed to explicitly delete only the tables for that particular service. Nowadays, dev and test databases live on their own MySQL Servers, so each service gets its own database (like in production). This makes it a lot easier to reset a service's database, we just drop the MySQL database for that service.

The reason these steps were broken is that the sql configs in dev/test namespaces use K8s DNS for the `host`, which does not work out of the box in batch jobs because they are not in the K8s network. There's code in `database.py` that uses the K8s API to resolve the database host to an IP address that the batch jobs can access. This is why I wrote a python script instead of just using `mysql`. I tested these with the following dev deploy, which scrapped everything and I was able to log in after it was done!. ```; hailctl dev deploy -b daniel-goldstein/hail:dev-ns-delete-db -s delete_auth_tables,delete_batch_tables,deploy_batch,add_developers; ```. cc: @sjparsa, @iris-garden given your recent dev namespace woes",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13456:87,test,test,87,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13456,6,"['log', 'test']","['log', 'test', 'tested']"

Testability,"This change adds an nginx sidecar to the batch-driver pod for terminating TLS. TLS negotiation has proven a major bottleneck to scheduling performance, as the batch-driver currently spends up to 60% of its CPU time in handshakes with workers.

So we can be confident that driver CPU is no longer a bottleneck even in the increased rate limit. ## So what's the bottleneck now?; Since the higher rate limit still leaves the driver plenty of CPU room (I've seen it peak at 60% of a vCPU), why not crank it higher? Well, we're increasing concurrency so latent deadlocks start to be a bigger issue again. We start to see tens of deadlocks per second in the proposed rate limit and hundreds at higher rate limits. As a result, we're spending more cycles repeating queries instead of actually scheduling faster. Next steps should focus on eliminating deadlocks before we can continue to max out CPU use. ## Miscellaneous; We'v",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11638:421,Benchmark,Benchmarking,421,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11638,3,"['Benchmark', 'benchmark']","['Benchmarking', 'benchmark']"

Testability,"This change creates mysql pods for test and dev namespaces, instead of sharing the CloudSQL database server. The areas of change are as follows:. ### Generation of the namespace's database-server-config; The current approach in main does a little trick. Since the current `createDatabase` step uses the `database-server-config` from default to generate admin/user sql configs, the CI pipeline creates a dummy database `test-database-instance` to create a `sql-test-instance-admin-config` that inherits the credentials from the production `database-server-config`, and then copies that within the test namespace to `database-server-config`. In this change, since we are creating the server ourselves, we can just replace these with a step that creates a `database-server-config` from scratch, and then uses that for the DB pod. Overall making these changes really gave me the heebie jeebies that the test and dev namespaces have all these credentials to the CloudSQL server. I'm glad this gets rid of that. ### Accessing the database server; We use the DB pod's service DNS name as the `host` so inside Kubernetes this Just Works. The one caveat is the CI pipeline in which we run migrations in batch jobs. Those jobs need a way to reach the DB pod. I achieve this with a NodePort and then use the job's K8s credentials to resolve the node and port that the DB is on. The code I've added to do this resolution feels a bit janky, wouldn't mind some feedback on that. In terms of security, if a user job was able to somehow resolve the address of a test db, they would still not have the credentials to access it, and this is currently also the case with the production database. Nevertheless, this does raise an action item that we should only allow traffic to the k8s and DB subnets for `network=private` jobs, but I think we should make that a separate PR. ### Database creation; In order to test this properly in a dev deploy, I needed to make some changes to `create_database.py`.

By sprinking calls to ; `time` throughout the codebase after entering functions, we obtain a nice trace; of the timings with `sourcecode.Enclosing`, minus the previous verbosity.

Testability,"This ended up being a great lesson in `asyncio`!. `kubernetes_asyncio` has a deeply hidden `asyncio.ClientSession` that doesn't get properly closed when we restart services with `SIGINT`. Turns out the `__del__` method on the `RESTClient` deep inside the library that holds this client session sets up a future with asyncio to close the session, but I suspect that this object is getting deleted _after_ the event loop closes. As a result we get a bunch of garbage in the logs that; - the event loop is already closed when something is trying to happen; - a `ClientSession.close` was never properly awaited. I initially tried to explicitly close the client session but still dealt with the problem that the `k8s_client` was trying to interact with the even loop after it closed. Explicitly deleting the `k8s_client` on cleanup and then awaiting any remaining futures (so the client session `close`) appears to fix the problem as I get no more errors on shutdown, but let me know if this isn't kosher.

Testability,"This fixes a bug in joins where:; * The join key is a prefix of the left key; * Values of the join key in the left table span multiple partitions. For example, say the left table is `{[(0, 0), (0, 1)], [(0, 2), (1, 0)]}`, where the two lists of tuples are the two partitions, and the key is the entire tuple, and the join key is just the first field. Then in the old code; ```; val loweredLeft = lower(left).strictify(); val leftKeyToRightKeyMap = left.typ.keyType.fieldNames.zip(right.typ.keyType.fieldNames).toMap; val newRightPartitioner = loweredLeft.partitioner.coarsen(commonKeyLength); .rename(leftKeyToRightKeyMap); val loweredRight = lower(right).repartitionNoShuffle(newRightPartitioner); ```; the left partitioner is coarsened to `[(0), (0)], [(0), (1)]` in the third line, and the `repartitionNoShuffle` in the fourth line fails because rows with key `(0)` are split across both partitions. One possible fix would be to strictify the coarsened partitioner, which in this case would force the left table to one partition. But this seems dangerous performance-wise. Instead, this PR makes the lowered behavior match the old behavior, which is to ""repartition"" the right to the invalid partitioner `[(0), (0)], [(0), (1)]`, meaning rows with key `(0)` get duplicated into both partitions. This is exactly the intended semantics of `alignAndZipPartitions` as described in the code:; > The partitioner of the result will be the left partitioner. Each partition will be computed by 'joiner', with corresponding partition of 'this' as first iterator, and with all rows of 'that' whose 'joinKey' might match something in partition as the second iterator. This behavior is implemented with a flag `allowDuplication` on `repartitionNoShuffle`.

Testability,"This fixes a few of problems:; - Batch.jobs() was discarding the job json objects and returning an Job objects. This is not OK because we need the metadata from the json objects for efficiency (e.g. in CI PR/batch pages).; - We confused Job.status(), which is the job json object, with the status field of that object. In particular, we got that wrong in BatchFormatVersion.get_status_exit_code_duration in the call to Job.{exit_code, total_duration_msecs}. Add a test to check we got this right.; - Return the duration in msecs, not a string, because as an API, the string is useless. humanize it before sending it to the API. I think the batch client is (1) has a lot of legacy baggage that can be cleaned up, and (2) is massive overkill and can probably be cleaned up. It should probably have no objects, pass around job_id ints or (batch_id, job_id) tuples, and be a thin wrapper around request calls. Pipeline should be the high level API.

Testability,"This implements my proposal to simplify aggregators here: http://dev.hail.is/t/proposal-for-aggregators/93/3. Builds on: https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3552. I still need to finish converting some tests from ExtractAggregatorSuite (they are currently commented out). Old-style aggregators (filter, map, flatMap) are expanded at toIR conversion time to ApplyAggOp and SeqOp. ApplyAggOp returns the result of the aggregation. ApplyAggOp's first argument, which must be of type TVoid, is the expression to run for each element being aggregated over. SeqOp merges a computed value into the RegionValueAggregator. I added a AggSignature that holds the AggOp, type being aggregated over and the RegionValueAggregator constructor argument types. This is stored by the ApplyAggOp and the SeqOp. @tpoterba I believe TAggregable is no longer used in the IR code and can go away when the AST gets ripped out. @danking I added some IR testing logic to TestUtils. Namely, `eval` evaluates an IR with environments, args and/or aggregations with a single call (and verifies that the interpret with and without optimization and compiler all agree). There are also functions for asserting the result of aggregations, for example:. ```; val aggSig = AggSignature(Sum(), TFloat64(), FastSeq()); assertEvalsTo(ApplyAggOp(; SeqOp(ApplyBinaryPrimOp(Multiply(), Ref(""a"", TFloat64()), Ref(""b"", TFloat64())), I32(0), aggSig),; FastSeq(), aggSig),; (FastIndexedSeq(Row(1.0, 10.0), Row(10.0, 10.0), Row(null, 10.0)), TStruct(""a"" -> TFloat64(), ""b"" -> TFloat64())),; 110.0); ```. The line:. > (FastIndexedSeq(Row(1.0, 10.0), ...), TStruct(""a"" -> TFloat64(), ""b"" -> TFloat64())),. is the IndexedSeq of values to aggregate over, along with their signature. The struct type is used to build the scope in which aggregators are evaluated. (A little noisy because of the aggregator syntax. It's noisier than I'd like it to be.).

It adds `TShuffle` which represents a shuffle and contains all the EType, PType, and Type information necessary to implement all nodes (thanks @catoverdrive !). `TShuffle` is realized at runtime by a `PCanonicalShuffle(true)`, which is a straight copy of `PCanonicalBinary`.

Testability,"This is a multi-stage overhaul of our Kubernetes load balancers / service discovery. This involves moving off of NGINX onto Envoy, but more importantly involves better control of what namespaces and services are active in our cluster at a given point in time. TL;DR Switching from NGINX to Envoy with CI acting as the ""control plane"" for our internal networking allows us to more easily dynamically configure our Kubernetes networking and achieve proper connection pooling/load-balancing over TLS, which translates to less resource consumption and lower request latencies. ## Motivation; This is primarily a performance-motivated change, and one largely based on our (ab)use of NGINX in order to work with our dynamically-generated Kubernetes test namespaces. Currently, we configure NGINX by creating server blocks that dynamically resolve and dispatch requests based on matching regular expressions on the host and path headers. This is in large part due that at gateway deploy time we do not statically know all of the namespaces and namespace-service combinations that will exist in the cluster in the future. This is true for `default`, but not test namespaces, and NGINX will refuse to start with statically-configured clusters that it cannot reach. Making the server blocks make the routing decisions dynamically circumvents this limitation. However, this prevents usage of NGINX [upstream](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html) blocks that provide connection pooling, at least in the community edition, and as a result the gateways will create and terminate a TCP connection per http request. This likely causes minor delays on the front-end through gateway, but this hampers performance greatly in job scheduling. The batch driver is forced to establish a new TCP connection and do an SSL handshake with the internal-gateway multiple times per job, which is expensive and slow. We currently have to dedicate a 2-core NGINX sidecar for the batch-driver just to terminate",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12095:743,test,test,743,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12095,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"This is a newer version of #9598. We decided to give users min(5Gi/core, 5 Gi) in `/` with mounting external storage at `/io` if they need more storage. All storage requests can be 0, 0 < storage < 10 will be rounded up to 10 Gi, or 10+Gi rounded up to the nearest integer. I added a loop to remove orphaned disks in gce.py. I changed how the resources appear in the spec. Now there's `req_cpu`, `req_storage`, `req_memory` which stores what the user specified. Then we also have `cores_mcpu`, `memory_bytes`, and `storage_gib` which are the actual resources allocated. I think this will be simpler and more understandable. Resources are computed in the front end now and the worker just uses the values from the front end (no more doing conversions on both the worker and front end). I kept backwards compatibility on the worker for now which can get deleted once there are no more jobs with batch format version < 6. I bumped the instance version to 16 so we know which workers have the new storage functionality. . I tested this by submitting 4 jobs on my 1 core test instance with 150Gi requests. I then looked at the worker logs to make sure the disks were created correctly and the value of the semaphore was correct. I also tested 0 Gi and 5 Gi by hand to make sure the resource fulfilled was 0Gi and 10Gi respectively. Lastly, I checked the billing to make sure we charged for the fraction of the SSD used as well as the cost of adding an extra persistent SSD for that job. I also looked at the disks in the GCE console to make sure they wear torn down correctly. Although there isn't a migration, we should make sure there are no non-ci jobs running so that we don't over allocate the storage available.

Testability,"This is super useful, thanks @jigold! A few high level comments:. - I'd love to have this checked in, but I don't think it should be part of the regular tests, esp. when they run against the production database and this is designed to find/stress the limits of the database.; - Also, this seems most useful for benchmarking different database configuration and settings, and we don't want to vary the production database (and in some cases, we can't, like decreasing the database size).; - Therefore, I think we just have a module you can run that takes a database connection settings and n_jobs, batch_size, batch_parallelism and number of replicates, and runs the benchmark, not integrated with the build system. And .sql files to create/clean up tables. When we want to run it, we can just clone the repo and run it directly. Then we can think about wrapping it in a larger test to spinning up database instances with various node and disk sizes and MySQL settings and see how they perform.; - You explore number of jobs and batch size, but I think you should also measure amount of batch insert parallelism. You can use bounded_gather I sent you. Then basically these two tests correspond to parallelism=1 and parallelism=infinity.; - I think you can get rid of the pymysql version.

Testability,"This is the current state of the C++ support. If you look at the tests in src/test/is/hail/nativecode/NativeCodeSuite.scala that should give a; quick overview of how it works, viz. 1. Generate C++ source code as a Scala String, then create a NativeModule which handles; the grunt work of getting it compiled, linked, and loaded, and allows you to look up functions; by name, and get a callable Scala object corresponding to the C++ function. 2. The NativeModule also allows the binary of the DLL to be passed around and instantiated; on other cluster nodes (but note that those nodes will need to have the correct versions of; the C++ runtime shared libraries in the right directories to allow symbols in the DLL to be; correctly resolved). This is not tested yet. 3. I have been using llvm-6.0.0 on Mac, and llvm-5.0 on linux. It makes a half-hearted attempt; to use whatever other compiler you have, but that may not work. We probably need to figure; out a standardized and automated way to get the right tools installed in the right place (and; get the right shared libraries on worker nodes). 4. Data which needs to be accessible to both Scala and C++ is held in C++ objects inheriting; from NativeObj, with lifetimes managed by std::shared_ptr, i.e. reference-counted. There's; some dirty under-the-hood plumbing to allow a shared_ptr to be smuggled into a Scala; object derived from NativeBase. These Scala-side object references must be managed; carefully using copyAssign/moveAssign/close in order to maintain the off-heap ref-counts. 5. There are some gnarly differences between Linux and MacOSX in the linker and dynamic; loading. I think I'm converging on the right compile/link options for each, but in getting; Linux to work it's possible that Mac is temporarily broken ...

What I've tested:. - hand deploy new auth, router-resolver to default,; - tested login/logout flow on web (auth.hail.is/login, /logout) and hailctl (hailctl auth login/logout); - then deploy in my namespace:. ```; hailctl dev deploy -b cseed/hail:auth -s deploy_auth,deploy_router,deploy_notebook2; ```. - and test login/logout flow via notebook2 (internal.hail.is/cseed/notebook2, etc.) and hailctl, where access to internal is mediated by production (default namespace) credentials. Note, to do this I copied the production oauth2 key to my namespace. We shouldn't do this in general and should create a shared dev oauth2 key. Alternatively, we should create a separate login flow doesn't use oauth2 but uses production credentials.; - and interactively tested notebook2 creating notebooks (but haven't tested the config of the notebooks themselves). Summary of changes:; - auth service that handles login/logout flow via Google OAuth2 and user verification via /userdata endpoint. Web sessions are stored in the aiohttp_session cookie (encrypted), command line sessions are stored in tokens file: tokens.json. Token files potentially contain tokens for multiple namespaces (e.g. default and cseed in the example workflow above).; - sessions are now started in the database, table `users.sessions`, which have session_id (32 random bytes, base64-encoded), user_id, creation time and max_age (for expiry); - I write notebook2 to use our async stack; - added a notion of ""deploy config"" that has three parts: location (one of external, k8s or gce), default_namespace (the default namespace to find services), and service_namespace (of overrides for specific services ... so e.g. you can use the default auth with batch in cseed). deploy_config main function is to construct URLs to contact services.; - JWTs and the jwt secret key are gone.; - Simplified configuration/data",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6892#issuecomment-527970251:138,test,tested,138,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6892#issuecomment-527970251,14,"['log', 'test']","['login', 'logout', 'test', 'tested']"

Testability,"This leverages the Indeed LSM tree. It implements this API:; - `start(...)`; - `put(x1, ...)` (keys are extracted from the records themselves); - `get(l, r)` which takes two key records and retrieves the values in `[l, r)`. There's a server (`ShuffleServer.scala`) and a client (`ShuffleClient.scala`). They communicate over TLS-secured TCP/IP sockets on a configurable port. The server has one thread per client socket. The client is currently single-threaded. I had to add a `log4j.properties` because I don't start a HailContext and log4j gets upset when you don't configure it.

It owns the executor service.; - `ShuffleUtils.scala` - Odds and ends.; - `Wire.scala` - Serializers and deserializers for various things.

Testability,"This looks like good start. A few comments:; - I prefer using MySQL over auth0 mainly because it simplifies our eventual backup/restore story. If you think that's simpler overall, great. I don't see how integrating our db with their service does anything for us.; - I assume you're planning to pull the user data from MySQL during the login flow and add it to cookie? I think @danking @jigold and I are interested in nailing down the format for the cookie and seeing an example.; - I agree with @danking we should have an internal id field that's an integer. I think we should use that everywhere, and just use the auth0 id to look up the user record during login. So the integer id would be the primary key and the auth0 id would be unique with a secondary index.; - You need to get the GCP service account key and store it in a secret.; - The GCP service account needs permissions on the bucket. It should be bucket writer.; - Name ""user_secrets"" seems overly specific (buckets and service accounts are not secrets). ""user_data""?; - Please don't give the database a public IP.; - From a usability perspective, for user-visible names I have to say I really dislike long uuids and like the k8s-style short random string at the end. For k8s resource, you get this for free with the `generate_name` argument. For other stuff, long-term, this will potentially require retry logic to make it robust.; - I don't like this create table logic (FYI @danking @jigold).

It would be much more ideal to just make joins of variant tables against BGENs smarter, but I think the infrastructure necessary for that is big. cc: @cseed. List of changes:. - added `_variants_per_file` limits the loaded variants to variants at the given array of indexes (0-indexed, same order as on disk). - ~added `row_fields` which prevents reading and allocation of LID and RSID (also improved python-type-checking for `row_fields` and `entry_fields`)~ Moved to #3779 and #3778. - ~fixed table-table joins to _not_ always coerce (thus computing partition keys of) the right-hand table~ Moved to #3723 . - ~added a check that prevents globals and sample annotations copying when they're not used in the body of a MatrixMapCols~ Moved to #3751. - ~fixed a bug in `IndexBTree` wherein if the number of elements was a multiple of 1024, an unnecessary 1024 elements were added to the end of the index file (which I believe breaks the reading process which expects the number of bytes to correspond to the size of the tree)~ Moved to #3750. - ~added `IndexBTree2` which is just an in-memory list of the variant start positions. This is a fair bit of data. Chromosome 1 has about 250 million bases, so in the worst case this is 250 * 8 million bytes = 2 GB. It occurs to me that this is actually way to much data to load on the master node in general (since I just try to open the indexes for every file). I should switch this to a disk-based index.~ Made it disk-based, called it `OnDiskBTreeIndexToValue` #3794. - each hadoop `FileSplit` now contains a possibly null (indicating no filter) list of variants (by index) to keep, in practice this should be quite small. - ~I changed several asserts to `if`'s with ",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3727:11,test,tests,11,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3727,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"This probably needs a little cleanup. What's this for? Well, in another branch I have a bunch of IR rewrite optimizations. Those rewrite rules (1) want to test types (e.g. eliminate a cast of a type to itself), and they (2) also want to create new IRs which therefore need well-formed types. Calculating all the intermediate types explicitly (or calling Infer) everywhere both seem like non-starters. Therefore, I changed the IR nodes to compute their own types. I repurposed Infer, but it is no longer recursive. This meant that In, InAgg and Ref needed to carry their types, becuase, in the old, Infer-based way, they were dependent on the environment to type themselves, but that's no longer possible. I also repurposed Infer as a recursive type checker. This created two subtle problems: (1) the IR code uses rvRowType everywhere in stead of rowType (so it can reuse pointers to the full row) and (2) toIR needs to set the Ref type from the symbol table, but the symbol table strips out all missing bits, so the types on Ref terms disagreed with the actual values flowing around. I resolved this in two ways: (1) va now refers to the full rvRowType in all eval contexts, everywhere. (This is closer to the existing IR behavior.) (2) the symbol table no longer strips missingness, but it is stripped by Ref when the symbol is referenced. Ref also records the unstripped type which is used by toIR.

Testability,"This refactors the parser to use `BindingEnv`, which tracks the separate eval, agg, scan, and relational environments.

I don't like duplicating the (rather complicated) binding behavior of the nodes, but I couldn't find a way to avoid it without a much larger refactoring of the IR. So I tried to make the binding logic in the parser be as direct a copy of what is encoded in `Binds.scala` as possible.

Testability,"This should fix the test_copy failures. The problem was, we were sending a mutable byte iterator for data when inserting a new object. If that insert read some of the data, failed, and was retried, the data that was read was lost and the retry started where the failed insert left off. To retry writes, you need to keep around the data you've sent to resend in case of failure. So you don't have to keep around an unbounded amount of data, Google Storage supports resumable uploads: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/resumable-uploads. This allows us to send data in chunks, and release the data after Google reports back that the data has been committed. `StorageClient.insert_object`, when the upload type is resumable (the default), takes an additional argument `bufsize`. This is the amount the amount that the writer will buffer for retries, and the size of the chunks sent to GCS.

It is hard to do on the cost string, so I included msec_mcpu in the batch/job status response to verify it. In trying to verify it, I noticed that timestamps in the attempts table were slightly truncated compared to start/end times in the status (JSON). This lead to rounding errors and slight disagreement. 3. Rather descend into the floating point rabbit hole of madness, I changed times everywhere to be stored as integers in milliseconds (like unix time, since the epoch).

Testability,"Tim, . This actually isn't bad.

Testability,"Tim, bug in the test fixed...but I'm not entirely clear why it should have caused an issue yet. In PBaseStruct.copyFromType, I was calling srcFieldType.storeShallowAtOffset instead of dstFieldType.storeShallowAtOffset, in a case where srcFieldType was +PCArray and dstFieldType was PCArray, aka:. ```scala; srcFieldType: +PCArray[+PInt32], dstFieldType: PCArray[PInt32]; ```. Where the invocation is:. ```scala; srcFieldType.storeShallowAtOffset(; this.fieldOffset(dstStructAddress, dstField.index),; dstFieldType.copyFromType(...); ```. The storeShallowAtOffset function on PCArray is stateless and identical between required and non-required PCArray instantiations:. ```scala; def storeShallowAtOffset(dstAddress: Code[Long], valueAddress: Code[Long]): Code[Unit] =; Region.storeAddress(dstAddress, valueAddress); ```. I don't have a clear idea why this issue occurred. Also, clearly not easily triggered, required PStruct(""bar"" -> PArray(PInt32(true),false) dest and PStruct(""bar"" -> PArray(PInt32(true),true) source, having the ""bar"" field be a primitive wouldn't do it (we had those tests)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7958#issuecomment-578204878:16,test,test,16,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7958#issuecomment-578204878,4,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"Tim, would you have any recommendations?. ```sh; Gradle suite > Gradle test > is.hail.expr.ir.IRSuite.regressionTestUnifyBug FAILED; scala.MatchError: +Void (of class is.hail.expr.types.physical.PVoid$); at is.hail.expr.types.physical.PType.setRequired(PType.scala:206); at is.hail.expr.ir.InferPType$.apply(InferPType.scala:209); at is.hail.expr.ir.IR$class.inferSetPType(IR.scala:33); at is.hail.expr.ir.ArrayMap.inferSetPType(IR.scala:232); at is.hail.expr.ir.InferPType$$anonfun$apply$8.apply(InferPType.scala:359); at is.hail.expr.ir.InferPType$$anonfun$apply$8.apply(InferPType.scala:358); ```. This occurs because the IR is the following:. ```sh; ; //a; Literal(array<interval<locus<GRCh37>>>,WrappedArray([20:10277621-20:11898992))); // name; __iruid_11; //body; ApplySpecial(Interval,ArrayBuffer(MakeStruct(ArrayBuffer((locus,ApplySpecial(start,ArrayBuffer(Ref(__iruid_11,interval<locus<GRCh37>>)))))), MakeStruct(ArrayBuffer((locus,ApplySpecial(end,ArrayBuffer(Ref(__iruid_11,interval<locus<GRCh37>>)))))), True(), False())); ```. So I set this IR in the match to return PVoid(). However, in ArrayMap there is a requiredeness setter (which is inspired/copied from InferType's corresponding match:. ```scala; coerce[PStreamable](a.pType2).copyStreamable(body.pType2.setRequired(false)); ```. Which causes a nonsensical operation on PVoid, which is required: true (override final val). As an aside, ApplySpecial seems to allow operations on non-identical types, which would require algebraic types, rather than a singular: any time the types of its`Seq[IR]`'s are different. I have similar issues with other array operations, which want nodes that we currently don't support, including aggregator nodes.

Testability,"Tim,. Overall, the code looks great! I think I read through all the code except the PLINK and BGEN parsers themselves. I'm going to stop here and let you address the current comments before I make another pass. Couple of things:; - You need to rebase and the tests are failing. If there are big files involved, let's talk about that.; - You should write `importbgen` and `importplink` commands (and rename `import` `importvcf`). The reason for the different names is that I think each one will have options specific to the format (e.g. choice of VCF parser).; - A lot of comments I made at one point apply to lots of placing in the code (e.g. `: Unit =`, braces around a single statement, don't use Java file IO). When you make a fix (bug fix, style improvement, whatever), it is a good mental habit to think about other places in the code that might have the same problem.

Testability,"Typically, a CSRF attack can occur when `evil.com` tricks a user into requesting a state-changing URL at `batch.hail.is`.

The possible values for this attribute are:. - None => browser always sends this cookie in cross-site requests; - Strict => browser never sends this cookie in cross-site requests; - Lax => browser only sends this cookie in cross-site requests that use ""safe"" HTTP methods (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS). Both Lax and Strict protect against the most primitive forms of CSRF (a form on evil.com submitting a POST to batch.hail.is). Lax seems very reasonable, and still allows linking to, say, linking to jobs from Zulip's web app without the user needing to log in once they get there.

Testability,"Upgrading is a good instinct to have. I appreciate this PR. The story here is long, complex, and mundane. I've tried to include everything below. Python 3.6, (should) only appear in the linting image for python 3.6. The `hail-ubuntu` image explicitly installs Python 3.7. I'm happy to drop linting for Python 3.6 from build.yaml if compilers team is OK with that (ask Tim). We are already using Ubuntu 20.04 for our services and tests. See below for details, but `hail-ubuntu` is based on 20.04. We explicitly install JDK 8 in the `base` image. ---. This PR doesn't change the hail-ubuntu image which is the basis for nearly all our images. `DOCKER_ROOT_IMAGE` seems to have been introduced [here](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9660). That's my bad for not flagging in the review that this isn't actually a ""root image"". `DOCKER_ROOT_IMAGE` is just some Linux image with the standard utils. It was introduced as a distinct global concept when Docker Hub began enforcing rate limits (so we needed all our test images to live in GCR). If you look at the occurrences of `DOCKER_ROOT_IMAGE` or `docker_root_image` you'll find it's almost exclusively used in the tests except for one occurrence in `build-batch-worker-image-startup-gcp.sh`. We could just remove that line. That line is an attempt to keep a relatively recent version of the ubuntu image cached on the worker VM so that we can save some time when pulling the worker Docker image. In practice, the ubuntu image is extraordinarily tiny and quickly becomes out of date (because we rarely rebuild the VM). hail-ubuntu uses a timestamped ubuntu 20.04 tag: `ubuntu:focal-20201106`. I did this because we kept getting screwed by new ubuntu images getting released which were incompatible with us. We would only find out later when we changed the hail-ubuntu Dockerfile and triggered a refetch of the latest image at the `ubuntu:18.04` tag which included the breaking changes. You're correct that this is technical debt of ours.

The changes in IRSuite are arguably to a test that's no longer relevant---it was a regression test for a bug where we were occasionally double-emitting some part of the EmitTriplet in some cases. On the other hand, it feels kind of useful to keep as an illustration of how to thread IEmitCode through the function registry in a way that allows us to have weird interactions between the setup code of various IEmitCode args and the function itself. It was certainly instructive for me to work through how to translate the test functions in a way that made sense.

Testability,"User jobs should not have access to our internal network. This enforces that; requirement. Every job spec now has a `network` argument which can be unset,; null, `public`, or `private`. If `private`, the job has access to our internal; network. Both unset and null default to the `public` network. Only the ci user is permitted to create non-`public` network jobs. I define the; networks using Docker and `iptables`. First I create two distinct docker; networks `public` and `private`. These correspond to virtual Ethernet bridges. A; virtual bridge may be connected to many virtual interfaces. Each docker; container is given a virtual interface. The `public` virtual bridge is severely limited. All traffic originating from; the public bridge destined for any of the [three private; subnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network#Private_IPv4_addresses); is dropped.

Note that one's own IP is the IP of a container, so you might naively think; it should be dropped by the aforementioned rules. However, packets destined for; the container's own IP are never sent to the virtual bridge, the container knows; its own IP and simply routes the packets to itself.

Testability,"Using index expressions to represent abstract transformations on tensors. E.g. broadcasts from scalars and vectors to matrices would be represented by. ```; O(i, j) <- A(); O(i, j) <- A(i); O(i, j) <- A(j); ```; where A is the input tensor and O is the output tensor. Similarly, transpose and identity look like. ```; O(i, j) <- A(j, i); O(i, j) <- A(i, j); ```. Since the `O(i,j)` is the same in all of these, we only need to look at the ""in"" index expressions for broadcasts to distinguish what operation needs to be performed. There's also a Simplify rule to cut out identity broadcasts. ## Workaround; This method of index expressions treats scalars and vectors as 0-dimensional and 1-dimensional tensors, respectively. As such, their shapes in the IR are 0 and 1-dimensional. However, BlockMatrix (Py API and Scala backend) assumes that all BlockMatrices are 2-dimensional, with the potential to have dimensions of length 1. To satisfy the current user API while maintaining a tensor-like mindset in the IR, the BlockMatrixType now has a `isRowVector` flag to help the front-end BlockMatrix discern whether a 1-tensor IR should be treated as a row or column vector. As BlockMatrix generalizes to n-tensors this flag can be removed. The IR should not rely on this flag for any execution logic.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5338:1291,log,logic,1291,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5338,1,['log'],['logic']

Testability,"VMs or use a single multi-threaded JVM, we'll need to ensure the top-level; ClassLoader *does not have Hail on its classpath*. I looked briefly at this approach and found it; more work than the current approach. ---. My apologies for eliminating JVMProcess in this PR. It's an unrelated change which facilitated my; understanding of worker.py. I essentially inlined JVMProcess into JVMJob and eliminated any duplicative; code. ---. After making this change I restored the tests. Some tests had bitrotted. In the process of fixing; those tests, I found a few other bugs. Fixing these lower-level bugs unlocked a number of new; tests. One test (which was added since the service tests were removed) had to be marked as failing. Some; Hail operations rely on writing to the local file system. Implementing that properly in the Query; Worker will take some thought. Here are the bugs I fixed:. 1. Correct the error message raised when tests are run in a non-main thread (we look for this; message and start an event loop for Hail's async code because asyncio refuses to start an event; loop in a non-main thread). 2. Use a `SafeRow` to copy the globals data out of a Region and into durable, GC'ed objects. 3. Re-enable serialization of GoogleStorageFS (including its private key, which we really shouldn't; do; Tim is working on it), which was broken (presumably) when we changed Scala versions. The; `var` modifier ensures the name is compiled as a JVM field. 4. Correctly convert from a `Byte` to an `Int`. By default `Byte` to `Int` conversion (which is done; automatically when you return a `Byte` from a function whose return type is `Int`) is; sign-preserving. That means that the byte `0000 1111` is converted to the `Int` 15 and the byte; `1000 1111` is converted to the `Int` -113. The contract of; [`InputStream.read`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html#read--); is to return the unsigned integeral value of the next `Byte` or `-1` if we've reached the end of; t",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/10314:1868,test,tests,1868,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/10314,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"Various changes:. 1. Locking is now done with a carefully restricted use of flock(), and the makefiles use; perl's rename command to get atomic rename, so they don't need to take locks. 2. The makefile conforms to the customary use-whatever-is-on-$PATH, with the slight wrinkle that; the full pathnames of the commands used will be visible in the build log - so if someone; picks up something weird we'll at least see it. 3. There is a cache of NativeModule objects, so that we won't do enormous numbers of; calls to dlopen/dlclose. This may help in shuffle code, which creates a new PackDecoder; for each RV. 4. The hash function on (options, source) is now beefed up to cope with having only a; few distinct values of options; and is modified with the output of ""$(CXX) --version"",; so that when you upgrade your compiler, you won't get hits on modules compiled with the old; compiler. 5. build.gradle has a new target ""nativeLibPrebuilt"", for updating the prebuilt/lib/linux-x86-64; or prebuilt/lib/darwin. 6. The committed prebuilt libraries are built thus:. darwin - On my MacOS laptop, with the default (clang-based) compiler, -march=sandybridge; From my reading, I believe this should be compatible withall MacBook Pro's; released since 2011, and all versions of MacOS since 10.9 (the first to use; libc++ rather than libstdc++ as the default C++ library) - we're now at 10.13,; with 10.14 arriving some time in the fall. linux-x86-64 - Built on my home desktop running Ubuntu-16.04 LTS, and g++-5.0.4, with; -fabi-version=9.

Testability,"We currently cannot run untrusted code on our cluster and guarantee that malicious code in one pod does not leak into other pods, or affect the entire cluster. This proposal outlines a solution to this problem. *This is a work in progress*. ### TL;DR; Use Kata + CRI-Containerd runtime to sandbox pods, at a low performance cost. [Jessie Frazelle’s Blog: Hard Multi-Tenancy in Kubernetes](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/hard-multi-tenancy-in-kubernetes/). ### Roadmap; I would like to implement a test cluster that uses this system, and begin migrating our existing workloads to it asap. . *TODO*. ### Rationale; 1. We want resource preemption across users., running multiple user containers on a single cluster.; 2. This means sandboxing at the cluster level is out.; 3. Therefore we must sandbox at the pod (or container) level. Kata + CRI-Containerd chosen for performance and maturity reasons.; CRI-Containerd is much faster than CRI-O, and Kata is much faster than gVisor. Kata is a relatively mature product from Intel. Production users include JD.com. ### User-level access control ; An orthogonal issue that still needs to be addressed. [RBAC Authorization - Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/). *TODO*. ### Related: Firecracker; Interesting project, similar to Kata and gVisor in its isolation properties.

Testability,"We currently have several hail sparse matrix tables that contain up to 10,000 aggregated gVCF files that we aggregated using run_combiner(). We are trying to merge these tables together with a script that makes use of your combine_gvcfs function that is defined in your experimental vcf combiner library.

Testability,We don't make it easy to copy the hail log off the driver when a spark job fails. We should make that as automatic as possible. One way to do this is to add a call to [`hl.copy_log`](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/utils/index.html#hail.utils.copy_log) in the `except` block of `SparkBackend.execute`.

Testability,"We don't really have the infrastructure to create arbitrary values in c++ right (without translating into potentially large trees of IR). Since they already exist as Scala annotations in the IR, I decided that it was easier to serialize them in scala and decode them in the function rather than try to create logic and encode them in the function itself (we can't create them at compile-time and pass around naked hail-values, since they're region-backed and the functions can get serialized and shipped to workers, which don't have access to those). I put the decoded literals on a SparkFunctionContext in the hopes that it will be easier to plug in another literal broadcaster if/when the `Literal` IR no longer holds a Scala annotation, but in the meantime this was a reasonably straightforward way to get them into the c++ Emit code. I think we may not need to serialize literals like this for the `cxx.Compile.apply` methods, since they should all execute on the master node, but we don't currently enforce that so I was serializing there just to be safe. The alternative is to enforce execution of these functions on the master node, which I don't see a huge problem with off the top of my head? @cseed do you have feelings about this?

Or when that compiler takes 15 minutes to; compile it. It's the C++ equivalent of; the JVM ""no, that's just too much bytecode"". Or worst of all, it compiles; it but the code gives the wrong answers; because that particular compiler has a bug, and we never tested the; combination of our codegen with *that*; compiler/version.

The problem is that these classes define `__getitem__()` so their resources can be accessed as if via a dict. The assignment into multiple variables causes Python to try to interpret the RHS as something iterable, and as `__getitem__` is defined, it will use `__getitem__(0)`, `__getitem__(1)`,... to implement that iteration. These classes are not really iterable, so define a no-op `__iter__()` to prevent this.

Testability,"We seem to be running into spark/yarn scheduling limitations causing stages to often fail with a large number of partitions. Here, we implement a very simple chunking strategy to run spark jobs with a limited number of partitions at a time. The maximum parallelism is controlled by a new `spark_max_stage_parallelism` feature flag, which defaults to MAXINT until we can figure out a good default. Also, this change corrects a small error in logic for partition indices for call caching. The `resultHandler` argument of [`runJob`] is called with the job's partition index, not the index of the partition within the RDD. So we need to index into the `partitions` sequence when populating the results buffer.

Testability,"We want all allocations of `Region` to be controlled with a `using` or within a `RVDContext` (which will be appropriately closed). When we have achieved this, we can move the `Region` off-heap which provides a number of benefits including the use of raw-pointers in our Hail Object Representation as well as allocation free communication with other languages. This PR makes `LoadVCF` and `HailContext.readRows` use the regions in the `RVDContext`. Note that the _consumer_ is responsible for clearing the region when they're done with the current values. This is why `writePartitions` now includes `ctx.clear()`. Moreover, _producers_ must _not_ clear the region. These changes are tested by our whole infrastructure, but in particular, `is.hail.annotations.AnnotationsSuite.testReadWrite` exercises a lot of this. NB: We no longer clear the region between each read of a row. This means we could blow memory if we don't clear in the consumer. The other consumers are: aggregations, collects, shuffles, and joins. The tests pass though, so I guess I'm not too concerned for now. Once this is merged, I'll follow swiftly with uses of the RVDContext's region else where in our infrastructure. cc: @cseed . ---.

Testability,"We've had a number of pip issues recently, particularly incompatibilities with the `six` package. The central issue is that pip will install incompatible package versions with only a warning message. This primarily happens when a set of packages is installed (say in a parent image) and then a new set of packages are installed later. Pip attempts to satisfy all requirements of the packages in an installed set, but it does not consider the versions of packages already installed. In this PR, I pervasively change every use of `pip` to be followed by the use of `pip check`. Pip check errors if there are incompatible package versions installed. Rather than change every place that we use `pip install`, I created an ubuntu image with a script, `hail-pip-install`, and pip configuration which makes it easy to do the right thing. Now, we should always install python packages like this:. ```; hail-pip-install package1 package2 package3; ```. The script will ensure that all packages are compatible with existing packages. Moreover, it will retry downloads five times. I did not make every Dockerfile depend on the new hail-ubuntu-image because they are legacy Dockerfile that I didn't want to edit. These include the benchmark Dockerfile and some notebook workers. PySpark presented a challenge because we did not install it via pip. As a result, packages, such as Hail, which depend on PySpark failed the `pip check`. I modified all uses of PySpark to instead use the standard pip-installed version of PySpark. In particular, take a look at how query and shuffler changed. cc: @Dania-Abuhijleh @catoverdrive",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9593:1219,benchmark,benchmark,1219,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9593,1,['benchmark'],['benchmark']

For some reason, this seems to specifically happen with the byte value of 128.

The test failure that I'm running into currently has to do with the fact that the wait command there queries the endpoint without going through either the router or the gateway, (since it's e.g. hitting http://blog.wang/wang/blog/ directly), so it's getting the 301 redirect to https because the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header isn't set.

Testability,"When adding Azure CI, we made its context `hail-ci-azure`. This way, our primary CI would pick up any additional statuses that start with `hail-ci` and not merge PRs unless all those statuses were also green. The original GCP status, however, is still `ci-test`. This is awkward for a number of reasons:. - Inconsistent naming; - ci.azure.hail.is does not report the GCP status; - As a result of the above, Azure CI might not always make the same decisions as to who the merge candidate should be. The last is the most bothersome and the reason for this change. An example of how this can deadlock the current CI system is the following:. | |GCP |Azure |; |----|--------|----------|; |1 |Fail |Success |; |2 |Success|Pending |. GCP will see PR 2 as the merge candidate because out of the 2 it has no failing checks, and will wait for Azure to post a status. Azure, on the other hand, does not see GCP's status, and so views PR 1 as ready to merge and has no need to run any other PRs. Azure does not issue merge requests to Github as it is not the primary CI. This stalls both CIs until someone manually retries PR 2 on Azure or otherwise changes the system. The way in which we decide the merge priority should not be different on different CI instances, so long as each instance has the same view of the PRs. This PR is a step toward fixing that. I want to just change the GCP CI's status to `hail-ci-gcp` instead of the legacy `ci-test`. However, I don't want all the existing PR statuses to go to waste. So, this change picks up `ci-test` statuses in addition to `hail-ci-*` statuses, and mirrors any `ci-test` status as `hail-ci-gcp`. This way, if I change GCP's status to `hail-ci-gcp`, it will see existing statuses as its own and not try to re-compute statuses for all existing PRs. Once a PR has a real `hail-ci-gcp` status, I can go and delete the `ci-test` status without disturbing the system. Once all `ci-test` statuses are gone, we can just delete any mention of `ci-test` in the code b",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11958:256,test,test,256,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11958,1,['test'],['test']

While it can be difficult to derive the source of the client session, I think it's the one held by the `GCPWorkerAPI`. I've added an exit stack and added the session's close method to it. I also made a small change to `Worker`. I find it can be difficult to determine whether or not a particular class should close a client session because it's not always clear who owns it. Without a clear way to communicate this in python, I think we should just never transfer ownership of a `ClientSession` and always assume that if an object's constructor takes a client session, it should be assumed a borrow and not close the session when the object is closed.

Testability,"Whoops, sorry for not getting back to this! Basically, I'd like to see a test of just the heap structure exercised in a large number of ways (basically doing a compare + insert in all sorts of different configurations). You're kind of doing this with the large TakeBy test, but I'd prefer to see a simpler test with many, many more inserts being done and tested for correctness. This is basically to flush out any edge cases that you wouldn't be hitting with a more basic/structured test that wouldn't reach the correct internal state to trigger it. . I've found that creating a simple test structure that mimics the desired end result and using the random generator to generate comparison tests (with the count set pretty high) is generally a pretty good way of sanity checking and flushing these bugs out, rather than writing specific test cases---usually if I've written a test for a specific case, I won't have missed it when coding, and if I've missed an edge case when coding, I won't think to test it. I think I'm pushing on this extra hard because the generated code is at a level of complexity where I can look at it and say ""yeah, this looks generally right"" but I'm not sure that I trust myself, as the reviewer, to guarantee that it's accounted for every single insert configuration correctly, if that makes sense.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6942#issuecomment-530961530:73,test,test,73,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6942#issuecomment-530961530,20,['test'],"['test', 'tested', 'tests']"

I'm leaving IBD alone until @johnc1231 has his updates in and we can discuss. And hardcalls has the fakeRef issue to be dealt with later. ToStandardizedIndexRowMatrix is now ToHWENormalizedIndexedRowMatrix, alongside ToNormalizedIndexedRowMatrix and ToNormalizedRowMatrix. These all in turn map over genotype-array generating functions in RegressionUtils. I reimplemented that function for ToHWENormalizedIndexedRowMatrix as RegressionUtils.toHWENormalizedGtArray. The only methods using ToHWENormalizedIndexedRowMatrix are PCA and GRM, which both require split vds. So I've required the same on ToHWENormalizedIndexedRowMatrix for consistency and to take advantage of IntIterator in it's current state. We can circle back to the right more general approach later. I've also changed logreg to mapPartitions and wrote RegressionUtils.mutateLastColumn so logreg no longer constructs a new covariate matrix per variants, but rather mutates the last (gt) column of a shared matrix.

Inside `cleanup` we `trap """" INT TERM` to make `Ctrl-c` do nothing, because the user COUGH cotton COUGH might smash ctrl-c repeatedly and we might not kill the subprocess before they kills us ;).",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4785:19,test,test-local,19,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4785,3,['test'],"['test', 'test-local']"

Testability,"Wonder what your thoughts are on this. I think that we have too deep an image hierarchy and that it's only stalling our time-to-test in CI. I propose here getting rid of the run-tests image and just putting plink in the hail-run image. I also remove the dependency on service-base and just install hailtop in the hail-run image -- I don't think anything hail/hail should depend on services code. This change actually revealed an accidental dependency where there was a gear (services) test in the hail/python tests. I moved that over to the batch suite as batch is the primary user of that class and we don't have a gear suite atm. Ultimately, I think we should have a pretty flat docker image hierarchy. Each of our Dockerfiles does a decent job of following the docker mantra of dependencies first, code later. But if you consider the fact that we stack images on top of each other then you can see that in reality that doesn't translate to our images! We instead get an interleaving of hail code and dependencies such that it's very easy to break the cache for images like this one.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12396:128,test,test,128,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12396,4,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"Write loading lines from text files in a way that can be used by Spark or table lowering. This will be to lower the VCF and text file importers. This handles three cases:; - an (splittable) uncompressed file,; - a (splittable) bgzip compressed file, and; - an non-splittable compressed file compressed by some other codec. In this case, it will be loaded as a single partition. I test each of the three cases. I also ported the prexisting partition test that generates random splittings and tests that in the bgzip case. I tested with the number of tests turned up to 10,000. Two ideas here:. Each line has a fixed offset depending on the case (file offset, virtual offset, or decompressed offset). The split defines a partition of the offset spaces. For a partition (start, end), and line with offset x, the line belongs in the partition if x lies in the range (start, end] or, if it is the first partition, [start, end]. This is because, if at the beginning of a split, you can't tell if the line started earlier or not. The second idea is to copy the blocks one at a time into buf. bgzip blocks are max 64KB. `read` on a BGzipInputStream doesn't return data that spans blocks. So buf always contains the entire data for a block. This is used to track the offset o the beginning of the line.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8662:380,test,test,380,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8662,5,['test'],"['test', 'tested', 'tests']"
