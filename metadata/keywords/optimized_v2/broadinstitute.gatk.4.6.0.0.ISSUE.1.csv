Availability,"@kgururaj Thanks for adding the test. Running it locally on my laptop (without your fix) succeeds though - I have to bump it up from 1000 intervals to 9000 to reproduce the stack overflow. But if I do that, it takes a long time to run, since it appears to be creating lots of small partitions. Is there any way to get it to use fewer partitions in a case like this where there are lots of intervals ?. Somewhat more concerning is that when with 8000 intervals, I see a different failure mode. First I see lots (thousands) of these messages:. `[GenomicsDB::VariantStorageManager] INFO: ignore message ""[TileDB::StorageManager] Error: Cannot list TileDB directory; Directory buffer overflow."" in the previous line`. followed by a failure that ends like this:. `[TileDB::StorageManager] Error: Cannot store schema; Too many open files in system.; libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type LoadOperatorException: LoadOperatorException : Could not define TileDB array; TileDB error message : [TileDB::StorageManager] Error: Cannot store schema; Too many open files in system`.

Availability,"@laserson the `SAMRecord` vs. Google `Read` is a loooooong story.; The super-short version:; We had a bunch of utilities written for `SAMRecord` that @droazen refactored over months to take the GATKRead interface. As it happens, the SAM spec and the GA4GH spec are not 100% compatible. So, it's not possible to losslessly convert from A -> B -> A (where A is `SAMRecord` or Google `Read`). The cases where it doesn't work are edge cases, but they exist. Second, @jean-philippe-martin found that converting to Google `Read` was fairly expensive. Between those two points, I think we're probably better off with SAM-backed reads. (Also, right now the Google `Read` is serialized via JSON, so it's not that small anyway.). @tomwhite and @jean-philippe-martin, I think adding the header back will be fine for us engineers working on the engine, but it will make for a poorer user experience for newcomers and Comp Bios to burden them with having to care about what happens with shuffles (when they just want to prototype something). . That said, I think this is probably the best approach we have at our disposal. If we do, we need to do an excellent job of throwing errors if users try to perform actions that would require the header. The error message should explain what really happened and ideally point to some documentation we write explaining the stripping of the header and how to fix it. If this error occurs, it needs to be simple for anyone to fix it. @droazen @lbergelson, what do you two think?

My 2 cents for the md5 proposal is: what will happen if people install the python requirements without a conda environment?

Something better for downstream toolkits will be to create a `gatk.properties` file with entries for both the GATK-jar version and gatktool-python version; it can be easily parsed by gradle to populate the values.

Availability,"@lbergelson I completely agree. GenomicsDB has been a big step up from CombineGVCFs, but it's been a struggle. Here are some notable characteristics of our data, in case anything seems relevant:. - The core data is ~2K WGS (not WXS) rhesus macaque datasets. WXS tends to perform better.; - We imported them into a workspace using GenomicsDB. ; - We regularly append new batches. As the data has grown, we found we need to lower the batch size (maybe 50-100) to make GenomicsDbImport practically work. It's possible a --consolidate type step might help us; however, our earlier efforts to run this resulted in hung jobs.; - We execute these jobs scattered across a cluster that is using a lustre filesystem. We use the non-posix optimization flag.; - We include the unplaced contigs, so our genome is ~2,900 contigs.; - We currently ask GenotypeGVCFs to call sites genome-wide.

Availability,"@lbergelson I just tested with one of our variants in the test suite for HaplotyeCaller (specifically `20	10098219	.	TATATATA	T,<NON_REF>`) and its definately the case that HaplotypeCaller will still output that variant even if you place the -L interval boundary inside the variant (like say at `10098221`) but it will fail to call that same deletion if you make the start of your interval anything but the first base of that deletion. . The HaplotypeCaller has its own filtering at Haplotype->Allele->Genotyper layer that restricts it to only calling alleles that START within the active region (excluding padding) which makes it impossible to output deletions starting before the provided intervals even if they overlap into the specified region. The HaplotypeCaller will however output deletions that go past the end of the provided -L intervals so long as they begin within the intervals in question. The HaplotypeCaller is hopelessly fickle and everything within a few thousand bases of the edge of the calling intervals is subject to start-position/calling failures and any given site may or may not disappear to assembly failures when close to the edge. Adjusting these settings at the VCF writer level could prevent the latter case from occurring (by filtering them with some strict setting to prevent deletions from overhanging the end of the -L region) but it cannot ever allow the former case to exist (that is to say it will never force a deletion from a few bases before the interval to be called by HaplotypeCaller since it will never send that allele to the genotyper under any circumstance). ; ; I would say that your branch adds an entirely new and subtle way for users to get confused about what the HaplotypeCaller is actually doing under the hood and why they did or didn't see a particular variant so we should tread carefully.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6339#issuecomment-908689670:1063,failure,failures,1063,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6339#issuecomment-908689670,2,['failure'],['failures']

Regarding the `Main` class, because you point it out here, I would like to have some control over `Main` and how it manages things like errors or logging header. Basically all the things that I'm facing at the moment are, apart of this error using the testing framework, is that the framework have tons of mentions to the GATK itself (error messages pointing to the GATK manual page or bundle tools), and little control over which of them should be expose to the final user.

Availability,"@lbergelson, just want to discuss some issues here-. 1. We currently have to use `--avoid-nio` with `--sample-name-map` and `--bypass-feature-reader` to get `GenomicsDBImport` to work with azure URIs. Why don't we just merge the `--avoid-nio` functionality with `--bypass-feauture-reader`, that is allow GenomicsDB to process the URIs by default?; 2. Noticed that the only way to use azure URIs for vcf names is by using `--sample-name-map`.

Availability,"@lbergelson. Our simple s3 nio library is not currently open source, but we would be willing to make it so after testing it properly. We found that to get the s3 nio library work with GATK, a few minor changes needed to be made in the GATK source. This is especially true for the spark tools because, on AWS EMR Spark clusters, s3 uris can be treated exactly as if they are HDFS uris. Therefore, it was not quite as simple for us to just add the s3 nio library to the classpath and have everything work as expected. For that reason we put the project on hold until GATK is closer to release.

Availability,"@ldgauthier - is this --genotype-given-alleles feature documented somewhere? i dont see mention of it in the git repo - maybe there's a feature branch? You write ""so if you're interested in positions where you havent seen a variant yet"" - are you referring to the situation where a position exists in the reference VCF, but there is no evidence of variation in any of the gVCFs/samples being called? . To make sure I understand this new feature: what I am trying to accomplish is conceptually pretty similar to providing a dbSNP reference VCF and expecting that my output would contain a call for every site/allele in that reference, plus any non-variant above-and-beyond that baseline. . I'm not sure if this is quite your question, but I could live with alleles being dropped in the output if they are not present in the gVCF data. I'm assuming that any of these additionally output sites would probably be 100% reference. An output that contains this site, shows only one allele, and lists all the samples as either reference or not callable would be adequate for downstream merging, unless I miss something.

Let me know what you think:. - https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4538 (Python factoring/PEP-8/code review); - factor python args handling (minimally factor out the inference args); - there is only one 2D test, which I think has no reads overlapping any of the variants; - we should add a test that specifies one or more intervals; - the tool currently adds standard VQSR header lines via addVQSRStandardHeaderLines, which is unnecssary; - integrate read downsampling; - determine/handle the failure mode when the user supplies a mix (of mismatched) 1D/2D arch and weights inputs. Other (not necessarily blockers):; - establish all defaults (weights/arch/etc) in Java code; - default arch is 1D - should this change to 2D ?; - see if we can remove the artificially small inference/batch sizes (1) used in the tests.

Availability,"@ldgauthier @mbabadi Revisiting this in detail in preparation for a Methods meeting presentation, I discovered that much of the initial poor model performance and the issue with the strange GQs on chr1 was actually fixed in #4335 via a seemingly innocuous change. . Prior to the change, the ploidy model used *lexicographical* sorting to determine contig order (see #4374), but the contig order of the per-contig counts matrix was determined by the *sequence dictionary*. This understandably leads to shenanigans, since the model needs to know things like the number of intervals on each contig. After the change, the sequence-dictionary order is properly used everywhere and most of the bad behavior seems to be resolved (not all of the unusual sex genotypes are resolved, but this may be partly due to mosaicism in those samples) . (@mbabadi, not sure if we actually realized this before? I don't recall nor do I see it discussed elsewhere, but if so, then consider this a note of it!). So the problems with this model are not as severe as we initially thought, and thus we can keep this issue at relatively low priority. Nevertheless, the improved model should still yield additional benefits, such as better depth estimates and ploidy qualities, as well as more robustness to unusual sex genotypes.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4371#issuecomment-414852311:1266,robust,robustness,1266,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4371#issuecomment-414852311,1,['robust'],['robustness']

Availability,"@ldgauthier @yfarjoun We have an update on this! We've identified the bug:. * When `AbstractFeatureReader.getFeatureReader()` tries to open a `.vcf.gz` that doesn't have an index, it returns a `TribbleIndexedFeatureReader` instead of a `TabixFeatureReader`, because `methods.isTabix()` returns false when an index is not present.; * `TribbleIndexedFeatureReader`, in turn, opens a Java vanilla `GZIPInputStream`, instead of the `BlockCompressedInputStream` that gets opened when you create a `TabixFeatureReader`.; * `GZIPInputStream`, in turn, has a *confirmed bug* filed against it in Oracle's bug tracker (see https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7036144#), that it inappropriately relies on the `available()` method to detect end-of-file, which is never safe to do given the contract of `available()`; * As the final piece in the ghastly puzzle, implementations of `SeekableStream` in htsjdk do not implement `available()` at all, instead using the default implementation which always returns 0. As a result of this combination of bugs in Java's `GZIPInputStream` itself and bugs in htsjdk's `SeekableStream` classes, end-of-file can be detected prematurely when within 26 bytes of the end of a block, due to the following code in `GZIPInputStream.readTrailer()`:. ```; if (this.in.available() > 0 || n > 26) {; ....; }; return true; // EOF; ```. Where `n` is the number of bytes left to inflate in the current block. The solution is to replace all usages of the bugged `GZIPInputStream` with `BlockCompressedInputStream` in tribble in htsjdk (at least, for points in the code where the input is known to be block-gzipped rather than regular gzipped).

Availability,"@ldgauthier Tests are still failing because I haven't updated test vcfs. Before I do so could I get your opinion? Here's a summary of the rationale behind each commit:. * fa34758 When we get to `realignReadToBestHaplotype` we have discarded bases outside of the assembly region but we still have hard clips in the read Cigar. This change forces us to keep those Cigar elements after realigning to the best haplotype so that we know how far past the assembly window the read extended.; * 6af7ad4 After the above change, `BaseQualityRankSum` was liable to look for discarded bases in the hard-clipped part of the read. This fixes that.; * 952d217 The `Clipping` annotation doesn't do anything. It counts the number of hard clips, but pre-this PR there are no hard clips because those bases don't get realigned to the best haplotype and post-this PR the ""hard clips"" are just bases outside the assembly region. As a placeholder I'm setting it to zero (note how this doesn't break any tests!) but really I think we should just get rid of it.; * This PR introduced some off-by-one errors in the depth annotation (but not the ADs). While looking into this I found an apparent bug where some reads that don't overlap a variant get counted in the depth. The issue was that we were counting clipped bases in the overlap. I don't think this is correct because by this point in the code we have unclipped soft clips and gone through local reassembly. Therefore, anything clipped here is a part of the read we truly don't believe belongs anywhere near the assembly region. This change alone breaks the tests with a few off-by-one DP fields.; * 8c51c0a Uses hard clips in the Cigar to correct read position annotations.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4956#issuecomment-400755806:1076,error,errors,1076,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4956#issuecomment-400755806,1,['error'],['errors']

Availability,"@ldgauthier Yeah, I was surprised too. The problematic pattern is interleaving `submit` and `has/consumeFinalizedItems` calls on a `ReservoirDownsampler`. `ReadsDownsamplingIterator` uses that pattern that, but I don't see any existing code that uses it with a `ReservoirDownsampler`. Interestingly, `PositionalDownsampler`, which uses a `ReservoirDownsampler`, masks the reservoir problem even when its used with `ReadsDownsamplingIterator by providing its own positional-based finalization semantics, and never consuming finalized items from the reservoir until it sees a position change. The Mutect code also doesn't interleave calls, so the change there is just to prevent triggering of the new checks I added. `AssemblyRegionWalker` does compose `Downsampler`s with a `ReadsDownsamplingIterator`, but AFACIT not directly with a `ReservoirDownsampler`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5594#issuecomment-456930026:362,mask,masks,362,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5594#issuecomment-456930026,2,"['Down', 'mask']","['Downsampler', 'masks']"

Availability,"@ldgauthier, @meganshand and I discussed whether we might want to switch from the one-sided p-values currently calculated by ExcessHet to mid p-values (which are used in the Hail implementation, see also https://www2.unil.ch/popgen/teaching/SISG14/Graffelman_Moreno_SAGMB_2013.pdf). She said you probably should make the call. As discussed by that reference, there can be significant differences between one-sided and mid p-values. However, since this PR already introduces differences between the old one-sided p-values and the corrected one-sided p-values, perhaps we want to go a step further and just switch over? Advantages would include consistency with Hail, as well as better power and type-1 error rate, at least according to that reference. But the test would no longer be specific to *excess* heterozygosity, which might not be desirable.

In my VCF I've got a variant that was called but it's only the consequence of a set of soft-clipped reads (it's a Haloplex assay, that's why I've got the 'bars' / high depth below). ![jeter](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/33838/22643385/885096d0-ec5e-11e6-91ae-7331affafc36.png). I was playing with the GATK 3.7 API to find the soft clipped reads overlapping my variation. ```java. @Downsample(by= DownsampleType.BY_SAMPLE, toCoverage=1000000); public class MyWalker ; 	extends RodWalker<Integer, Integer> implements TreeReducible<Integer> {; (...); public Integer map(RefMetaDataTracker tracker, ReferenceContext ref, AlignmentContext context) {; {; (...); final Genotype g=variantContext.getGenotype(i);; 		final ReadBackedPileup sampleReadBackedPileup =rbp.getPileupForSample(g.getSampleName());; 		 final List<GATKSAMRecord> recs= sampleReadBackedPileup.getReads();. (...); }. (...); }; ```. unfortunately **, I cannot find any GATKSAMRecord containing the soft clipping segment**. So my question is: does GATK cannot find my reads because it only considers **start/end** but not **unclippedStart/unclippedEnd** ? Is there any parameter to get those clipped reads ?.

Availability,"@marchoeppner `MarkDuplicatesGATK` was removed because it had fallen out-of-date with respect to the version in Picard, and as an unmaintained tool was in our view not safe for use, and was causing confusion for our users. The loss of CRAM support is an unfortunate side effect of its removal. We've been doing a lot of work on our parallel version of `MarkDuplicates`, however, which is called `MarkDuplicatesSpark`. This version is fully up-to-date with respect to the Picard version, can run much faster than the Picard version when multiple cores or multiple machines are available, and will fully support CRAM in the future. CRAM support in that tool will come as a side effect of our migration to the new Disq library (https://github.com/disq-bio/disq), which is scheduled to happen within the next few months. In the meantime, I'd suggest continuing to request the Picard community to add CRAM support to their version.

Availability,"@mbabadi commented on [Wed Oct 19 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/748). At the moment, CalculateTargetCoverage simply counts the number of overlapping reads with each target. Optionally, low quality calls are hard filtered. Here, we propose a probabilistic approach that avoids the usage of hard filters and fits well with the new probabilistic target coverage modeler. By definition, mapping quality MAPQ = -10 \log_10{mapping position is wrong} (see http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf, pg 5, item 5). It is defined in the range [0, 2^8-1]. The specific value 255 is reserved for when MAPQ is not available. Most MAPQs are well below 255. We consider the following process for assigning reads to each target. Pick a read ""k"" aligned to target ""t"" with a given MAPQ_k. By definition, it maps to the genomic position ""x"" with p_x = 1 - 10^{-MAPQ_k/10}, and to some other position with probability 1 - p_x. We refer to the alignment genomic position of read k as x_k, and the exome target(s) it overlaps with T_k. Let's assume we have T exome targets, and let z_{kt} be a 1-of-#T indicator variable for a read where t is a target and #T is the number of all exome targets. \pi_{kq} = P(z_{kq} = 1) =. p_k x O_{kq} if q \in T_k; (1 - p_k) / (#T - #T_k) if q \notin T_k. Here, O_{kq} is the fractional overlap of the read to an exome target q. Note that since we don't have the information about the next best alignment position, we take a flat prior. Finally, the number of reads belonging to target t, n_t, reads as:. n_t = \sum_k z_{kt}. Since there are many reads, n_t will be approximately Gaussian. It is an elementary calculation to calculate coverage mean E[n_t] and coverage variance var[n_t] in terms of \pi_{kq}. In the probabilistic target coverage model, var[n_t] will be added to the statistical noise. So, the read count collection will have two entries for each target: coverage mean, and coverage variance. ---. @mbabadi commented on [Wed Oct 19 2",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2908:639,avail,available,639,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2908,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"@meganshand Thanks for making the code better! If and only if you care to beautify it further while you're at it, I noticed a few other things:. * Using `addExact` instead of `+` is overkill, since the overflow it protects against can only occur if we have a read depth of 2,147,483,648. In any case, it just throws an error. If we wanted to be super-scrupulous, we would put an `if` statement in the `FisherExactTest` code to switch to an asymptotic approximation, but, like I said, overkill. * This class has it's own `apply` method which replicates `MathUtils::applyToArray`. * Similarly, it's `range` method should be deleted, and its use `support = range(lo, hi)` should become `support = new IndexRange(lo, hi)`. Then `IntStream.of(support).mapToDouble(___).toArray()` becomes `range.mapToDouble(___)` and `apply(promote(support), ___)` becomes `support.mapToDouble(___)`. * `final double relErr = 1 + pow(10, -7)` should become a `static` constant. * The steps; ```java; final double maxD1 = arrayMax(d1);; final double[] d2 = apply(apply(d1, d -> d - maxD1), d -> exp(d));; final double sumD2 = sum(d2);; return apply(d2, d -> d/sumD2);; ```; inside `dnHyper` are just a home-brewed way to normalize the log-space array `d1`. Let's go throught the steps: 1) find the max. 2) subtract the max -- subtracting a constant in log-space is equivalent to dividing by a constant in real space, and since we're normalizing in the end this constant is arbitrary. It's done for numerical stability. 3) exponentiate to get an unnormalized real-space array. 4) find the sum. 5) divide by the sum to get the normalized result. The log-10 version of this is `MathUtils::normalizeFromLog10ToLinearSpace(d1)`. You could either calculate `d1` in log-10 space or convert it, replacing the above line with `return MathUtils.normalizeFromLog10ToLinearSpace(MathUtils.applyToArrayInPlace(d1, MathUtils::logToLog10))`. The latter option is simpler. * Import static should be avoided except to escape horrible clutter",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2307#issuecomment-266263155:319,error,error,319,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2307#issuecomment-266263155,2,['error'],['error']
Availability,"@meganshand The stack trace shows that it's happening in the bam reading, not the vcf reading.

Can you do `samtools view` on this file and GATK `PrintReads` without complaint?. Since the problem is non-deterministic, `samjdk.use_async_io_write_samtools` is another possible culprit. . I suggest doing 5 runs for *each* of the following combinations of settings (should be added to *every* GATK4 command in the WDL):. 1. `--javaOptions ""-Dsamjdk.use_async_io_write_samtools=false""` (will need to add this to the existing `javaOptions` string for gatk-launch in your WDL). 2. `--cloudPrefetchBuffer 0 --cloudIndexPrefetchBuffer 0`. 3. `--use_jdk_deflater --use_jdk_inflater`.

It's not trivial to process >2000 gVCFs into genomicDb workspaces. Re-making all those gVCFs and then restarting the entire import is a huge hit.

Availability,"@mlathara Our primary use case involves calling variants on a constantly growing large dataset of WGS and WXS data. As you probably realize, the CombineGVCFs/GenomicsDBImport step is incredibly time consuming, and scatter/gather is pretty much essential to make these operations work in any halfway reasonable period of time. I have off-hand heard people from the broad mention large WXS datasets, and keep in mind we're working mostly w/ WGS. Regarding processing: our main downstream use right now is GenotypeGVCFs, and yes we expect to run that scatter/gather as well. I agree that in principle we could maintain these data as a folder of workspaces. In fact that was my original plan before I realized the GenomicsDB workspace already is essentially a folder of per-contig folders. The reason I like the solution of copying around the folders is b/c our end product is in an official file format that tools understand how to use. . A related point, before we decided to try GenomicsDB, my plan was to create a scheme (""file format"") that would allow our code to better operate on a folder of per-contig CombinedGVCF file. I would probably have written out a top-level JSON file that served the same purpose as the JSON files in a GenomicsDB workspace. As noted above, GenomicsDB is essentially already doing this for me. To the question about usage and support: perhaps that ways to think about this would be interval-based split and merge tools for GenomicsDB workspaces? This would obscure the internal structure of the workspace from the user (even if they basically just to folder copying). The split tool should be really simple and not have many caveats. The merge tool could have a lot of limits on what kind of workspaces can or cannot be merged. Perhaps it could do sanity checking on the JSON files to make sure they're compatible, and then copy the folders into this new merged workspace?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6620#issuecomment-635338868:475,down,downstream,475,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6620#issuecomment-635338868,2,['down'],['downstream']
Availability,"@mlathara Thanks for the reply. The reason I'm very interested in this is scatter/gather, so in our use-case, the inputs would be identical. Like you say, this would essentially be X jobs initiated with the same command, just different intervals. Merging all the resulting per-contig workspaces back into one workspace has a lot of logistical appeal, and the resulting folder would still be a valid GenomicsDB workspace. The alternate idea we had been considering was to maintain these as a folder of per-workspaces. That might work, but has the downside of not being a 'real' file format. Any future operations would need to be interval-aware, which could be a problem.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6557#issuecomment-630617523:546,down,downside,546,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6557#issuecomment-630617523,1,['down'],['downside']
Availability,"@mlathara The MD5 checking is going, but two conclusions: . 1) there are three array folders lacking a __coords.tdb file. 2) I counted the total fragment folders per contig, and many contig folders have a widely different number of fragments. I think the expected/correct number is 36, or at least the primary contigs seem to have this. Is there any way to figure out what is supposed to exist, and prune the problem folders?. I have a suspicion on where the duplicates could come from. Our jobs copy the source from non-lustre to the cluster, execute GenomicsDbImport/append, and copy the appended workspace to a new location. As we were getting this going, there were various job failures on the cluster. Some of these failures happened during that copy-back, resulting in a partially copied contig folder on the non-lustre disks. When the job restarted, it would destroy/recreate the copy on lustre, but I think it would be possible for this to not properly destroy that version that was partially copied off lustre. When the job finished again, it would rsync the new lustre version over that partial workspace. I dont know if fragment names are deterministic or not, but if they are not deterministic for a given job, then it might have been possible accumulate fragments there. I dont know if this happened, but it's the only place i can see where our code might have have been thoroughly cleaning up after itself and/or dealing with job failure. . As I said above, I'm collecting MD5sums for all the files in the workspace. This could find duplicates, but I'm not sure whether it tells me which one should be removed.

Availability,"@munrosa @ldgauthier Possible breakthrough. . First, what's definitely true about the het at 169510380 in 55_55003_F5region.bam when I reproduce the bug with `-L chr1:169510380 -ip 100`:. * The variant is considered active and triggers assembly, as it should.; * For every kmer size there are non-unique kmers in the reference, so it increases up to k = 85, the last attempt at which the engine relaxes the unique kmers requirement. (See `ReadThreadingAssembler` line 425).; * Once it reaches this kmer size, there are cycles in the graph and so no assembly is returned. (See `ReadThreadingAssembler` line 464). Thus no alt haplotype is discovered and the variant is missed. I believe there are two possible solutions.; * The assembly engine looks for cycles before pruning, but this order could be switched with no ill effects. In the case of this het there are no cycles after pruning because the apparent cycle was a poorly-supported path due to sequencing error. Here regular pruning works but the new `--adaptive-pruning` option would give a bit more security against false cycles.; * We don't actually have to check for cycles, especially in the last, desperate kmer attempt. Well, we do with the current recursive implementation of `KBestHaplotypeFinder`, but we *don't* in the Dijkstra's algorithm implementation currently under review: #5462. (Technical note: @ldgauthier I know I promised that this PR gives entirely equivalent results to the existing implementation, but technically this is only true if the existing implementation finishes in finite time. Due to the greedy -- but optimal -- nature of Dijkstra's algorithm, cycles do not cause issues). Personally, I am in favor of *both* solutions -- looking for cycles after pruning, and waiving the no-cycle requirement on the last attempt.

The data processed using GenomicsDBImport will contain a bunch of lines like these, with ambiguous REF alleles:. 19	75166	.	N	*,<NON_REF>	.	.

Availability,"@nalinigans @kgururaj I addressed the review comments and rebased the branch, however after rebasing some of the GenomicsDB tests that assert an exact match against `CombineGVCFs` output are failing, despite my regenerating the expected output using the latest `CombineGVCFs`.

Availability,"@nalinigans I will see how feasible that is on our cluster. Another question: I'm still baffled at the sort of issues we keep having if GenomicsDB is really used that widely. One question: I have been viewing the aggregated workspace as a semi-permanent store (more like a database). Rather than that, do most users just make the workspace on-the-fly, use it immediately, and then discard? I was thinking overnight about this, and I'm wondering if we should simply drop the idea of even trying to make workspaces with whole chromosomes. I *think* we could scatter 1000 jobs for the genome, give each a coordinate set, then import the 2000 gVCGs into a workspace of only 2m sites or so, do GenotypeGVCFs, and discard that workspace, and then merge all those VCFs. I thought in the past I read guidance that the GenomicsDB workspace needed to import intact contigs. However, if the only downstream application is to run GenotypeGVCFs on a the same targeted region, is there any reason that woudlnt work? I would hope that running GenomicsDbImport with -L would import any gVCF variant overlapping that interval, and therefore I dont think subsetting to a partial chromosome would matter.

Availability,"@nalinigans pointed out that even if we do switch this pipeline back to the BCF codec, it's still likely to encounter errors with 64-bit values due to some recent changes in GenomicsDB, which now throws an exception for these values instead of silently truncating them as it did in the past. So just switching to the BCF codec in the WDL might not be enough. A couple of other options we discussed today for a quick fix for this issue:. - @ldgauthier suggested that we change the WDL to use an older (pre-4.1.8.0) version of GATK that is known to work well with this pipeline, which would be an easy change. The only problem is that users might run `CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals` in the latest GATK independently of the WDL anyway and continue to run into this issue. - @nalinigans suggested that we patch `CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals` so that it does something sensible when the AD annotation is completely missing. Since AD was already likely being truncated by the BCF codec in previous versions of this pipeline, its value was never particularly trustworthy to begin with. Whatever option we go with, we'll need to add a good regression test for the PoN workflow that would have caught this issue. Longer term, we'll plan on developing a fix at the HTSJDK level for the way missing values are handled for the AD and PL annotations in the VCF codec (@lbergelson is currently looking into how this could be done). @fleharty What are your thoughts?

Availability,"@nh13 As a first step I'd suggest filing a ticket against the GKL (https://github.com/Intel-HLS/GKL) so that Intel engineers can have a look (but leave this GATK ticket open so that we can track it here as well). . This will be difficult to debug without a test case that Intel can run to reproduce the issue on their end. Does the crash only occur with this one particular sample, or have you seen it on more than one sample? If you could get to the point where you can reproduce it on a shareable bam snippet, that would obviously maximize the chances of this getting fixed. Intel is currently (at our request) doing a pass on the GKL with `valgrind` to find and fix memory safety issues (https://github.com/Intel-HLS/GKL/issues/107), so we expect the next GKL release to fix a bunch of ""use after free""-type errors. Maybe they'll get lucky and fix this one as well. Timeline for the release is within the next ~2-3 months. . After that we've asked them to test the GKL with long reads data, which is also known to trigger crashes like this (https://github.com/Intel-HLS/GKL/issues/105).

Availability,"@nh13 I spent a little time looking at this case. It seems like what happened is an assembly failure (that seems to occur since the stars align on the mq 20 limiting assembly graph vs the mq 60 or the mq 1 assembly graph. All of the variation in the graph is in a dangling head which often causes problem and in this case causes the variant to sometimes not be correctly assembled. This is where the dangling head gets separated from garbage in the 20 threshold graph: ![Screen Shot 2022-01-25 at 4 13 52 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16102845/151060728-5a0d4d95-2eb4-4777-a0e9-34b07b2e6196.png).

This seems to have caused the two thresholds to assemble different haplotypes after dangling end recovery (since all of these are dangling ends because the assembly engine can't do anything else because there is not enough padding provided) and it just so happens this failed assembly misses the correct haplotype in that 20 threshold graph and we end up throwing away most of the reads as incongruent with assembly as a result which is why the depth drops out so low at that site. This is a pretty rare edge case and I happened to be able to recover the 20 mq threshold variant with reasonable correct coverage by playing with the `--min-pruning 4` argument. In general though this issue might or might not have existed if the bam snippet provided (and especially the calling interval you provided of chr7:145945238-145945238) were not centered on one single point since assembly works best and is most likely to succeed when it has a few hundred bases of padding around the vari",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7124#issuecomment-1021629139:93,failure,failure,93,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7124#issuecomment-1021629139,1,['failure'],['failure']

Availability,"@owensgl Sorry you're running into problems. We typically speed up the process by running multiple GenotypeGVCF processes in parallel, subsetting by genomic intervals. GenotypeGVCFs isn't really multicore, you'll probably be best off giving each process 1 or 2 cores. (You'll see better performance with 2 since java has parallel garbage collection, but it might be more cost effective to run twice as many slower processes...) If you do that you'll want to run with `--only-output-calls-starting-in-intervals` enabled in order to avoid problems on the edges of intervals. . Things tend to bog down with many highly multi-allelic sites. If you have a population with very high diversity you may be hitting lots of sites like that. I'm not sure why it's as slow as you say it is though. It should be faster than 800bp / 30 minutes even with old qual. If you could provide a subset of your data we might be able to profile and see if there's some pathological case we're not handling well.

Availability,@rhysnewell My guess is that you are seeing the effects of random downsampling. HaplotypeCaller downsamples high-depth sites using a reservoir downsampling algorithm.

Availability,"@rhysnewell The default settings for the GATK downsampler are optimized for germline calling on typical (ie., Illumina) short reads data. The goal of the downsampler is to control memory usage at dubious sites where the aligner happens to place huge numbers of low-mapping-quality reads, without harming the quality of the variant calls in any meaningful way. By default, if there are more than 50 reads starting at the exact same alignment start position, GATK will start to randomly eliminate reads -- this gives a maximum total coverage for each locus of `50 * read_length`, which is more than sufficient for typical whole-exome or genome germline calling. For other applications, such as amplicon sequencing (where the reads inherently all tend to start at the same positions) or microbial calling, these defaults will not work well, and you are likely better off disabling the built-in downsampler completely, and using a different downsampling approach if memory use is an issue.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7873#issuecomment-1139176006:46,down,downsampler,46,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7873#issuecomment-1139176006,4,['down'],"['downsampler', 'downsampling']"

Once a developer leaves, this is all that typically remains for the rest of us that may have to answer forum question on the code or further develop the functionality. We get questions on all ranges of tool versions and minor releases. . Even when we deprecate a tool or feature, we give people fair warning that the tool/feature will be deprecated before literally removing it from the codebase. - I understand you would rather folks drive the new car but the old clunky car model is out there on the road and is being driven by researchers right now. When they have questions, they come to the GATK forum for answers and we need to have at the least tool documentation. ; - If time is limiting, the least we should do for these legacy tools is to state within the doc that (i) folks should use another tool XYZ instead and (ii) the tool/option will be deprecated in the near future.

Availability,"@samuelklee DRAGEN STRE model doesn't actually make any alterations to the smith waterman parameters or how they work, it just works by adjusting the indel gap penalties that are used for the PairHMM. At one point we were concerned about SW parameters being different with dragen but as it turns out the biggest visible effect of the SW parameters on the output (the alignment we perform after haplotypes discovery) is irrelevant since they don't realign their reads internally. We kept the default gatk alignment behavior and thus the SW parameters that are used (for dangling head recovery which I believe are the old arguments) still match. As far as unifying the parameters I suspect it could be done though one wonders if there aren't risks where the different contexts in which we use the parameters will not perform as well with a unified set. Speculation on my part though. I agree with David that we should be cautious about making changes that will affect the HaplotypeCaller before November. .

It reminds me [of this issue mentioned on the forums from GATK3.8](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/12791/too-many-open-files) but the error still occurs even if I limit that step to a single thread. I'm running on a Red Had HPC with 16 threads and 200GB of RAM available and using Cromwell v34. After checked with the manager for my cluster it seems the error occurred when over 60K files were opened simultaneously so this looks to me more like a memory leak than a ulimit issue.

Availability,"@samuelklee I've worked through all of the issues with the other repos (Barclay, picard, etc.), so we're ready to move forward with Java 17 reviews, but the `ModelSegments` tests are still inconsistent. This branch has updated `ModelSegments` expected result files that were produced locally with Java 17 (based on our discussion from some months ago), but now the same tests still fail on the docker. They succeed when run locally or in the CI non-docker job. At one point when I looked into these, the values produced when the tests fail look similar(/identical ?) to the values that the tests USED to produce (i.e., I suspect if we reverted expected results files, the tests might succeed on the docker and fail on the non-docker). I'm not sure what is causing the instability, but this is going to become a blocking issue for this in the next couple of weeks. We also have the option of disabling them only on the docker (or non-docker), but I hate to do that. Can you take a look at this in the next week or so ?.

Availability,"@samuelklee It wasn't just a rebase, it was a complete rewrite because the old code had since become completely entangled with DRAGEN code. But I did it! Everything is passing, the code is dramatically simpler, and it's even a bit faster. I have done my best to make a coherent commit history. I would recommend reviewing one commit at a time in side-by-side diff mode. Note that some commits rip out old code and replace it with pseudocode, deferring the new code to a later commit. Other commits tell a story of what all the different caches meant in order to motivate the simpification of later commits. The baroqueness of the old code was motivated by three considerations:; * cache-friendliness -- traversing all arrays by incrementing the innermost index, reads. This is absolutely essential.; * flattening 3D arrays into 1D arrays. This was a premature optimization.; * Precomputing addition operations -- this was misguided. The DRAGEN code relied on these caches in a rather complex way, which fortunately turned out not to be necessary and which could be dramatically simplified. My notes on tracking all the variables from the parent genotype calculator down to the DRAGEN calculator are in this google doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v6s57mUAwfj38nL3VdktjA059kYBkJfokq18IDy79E8/edit?usp=sharing.

Availability,"@samuelklee The module can now save and load everything, including the state of the optimizer. This allows to making interesting inference pipelines. Here's a decent strategy for obtaining the global optimum (it works flawlessly on simulated data every time):. - In the first pass, one disables annealing and obtains the variational parameters in a thermal state. The temperature needs to be _high enough_ to allow most/all local minima to merge, though, not too high to allow copy numbers to travel too far away from baseline copy numbers. If this occurs, one must anneal very slowly in the next stage (see below). The results are checkpointed once converged. - In the second pass, one makes another call to the CLI tool, this time w/ annealing enabled (starting from the same temperature) and starting from the checkpointed thermal results (model params, posteriors, adam(ax) state). The annealing rate must be slow enough to prevent thermal fluctuations from getting quenched (i.e. the evolution must be quasi-isothermal). One must look for a steady and linear rise of ELBO, such that when the annealing protocol ends, SNR quickly drops to values below 1. In both runs, the learning rate must be very small (in the rate 0.01-0.05) such that we wouldn't have to worry about controlling stochastic noise. Adam(ax) quickly adjusts its moment estimates and compensates for the small learning rate, so this doesn't increase the training time significantly.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3838#issuecomment-347369020:632,checkpoint,checkpointed,632,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3838#issuecomment-347369020,4,['checkpoint'],['checkpointed']

Should just be a matter of implementing the pseudocode in Neal 2003 http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aos/1056562461. -Add Metropolis-Hastings univariate sampler as alternative to SliceSampler. -Add Metropolis-Hastings/nested/etc. multivariate samplers as alternatives to GibbsSampler. This should only be tackled if a model/dataset necessitates it. -Implement hierarchical/multilevel models in an OOP way. Currently, the samplers operate on lists of global parameters and lists of lists of ""local"" parameters (i.e., segment-level or site-level parameters), which is a bit clunky. -Add convergence diagnostics (e.g., autocorrelation time). -Add ability to make trace plots and corner plots. -Implement more flexible discarding of burn-in. Currently, samples from all iterations are aggregated in memory. Depending on the maximum number of iterations we want to allow, it might be better to write samples to disk, only store samples in memory after burn-in, etc. so we don't run into memory issues. -Parallelization (again, only if a model/dataset necessitates it). ---. @LeeTL1220 commented on [Tue Nov 03 2015](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/126#issuecomment-153466956). @samuelklee Do we need this for the beta release?. ---. @samuelklee commented on [Tue Nov 03 2015](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/126#issuecomment-153471237).

Availability,"@stefandiederich, I think this is a problem with how your BED file is being interpreted. In general, with GATK, it's best to use 1-based coordinates intervals, e.g. that of a [Picard-style interval_list](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/1319/collected-faqs-about-interval-lists). BED is 0-based. See https://www.biostars.org/p/84686/ for a clear illustration of the differences. . If provided a BED file, i.e. an intervals list with `.bed` extension, GATK will convert it to the expected 1-based format. So, if `chr2 29430911 29430911` is 0-based BED, then conversion to 1-based would yield `chr2 29430912 29430911`, making the stop less than the start as the error message says. . It seems though that your intervals are actually already 1-based, not 0-based (which the BED format implies).

We should find a good balance between these opposing forces. ---. @davidbenjamin commented on [Sun Apr 09 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/959#issuecomment-292795106). @takutosato I recently made a few modest (and orthogonal) steps to clean the wdl (PR #974).

Availability,"@takutosato had a good suggestion: to stratify to low-complexity regions in the high-confidence regions. Not sure how many variants are there, but will take a look. EDIT: looks like it's ~5k / ~54k on chr22 in CHM. More generally, I think that defining the appropriate loss function for optimization to set ""default"" parameter values obviously has no unique answer. The problem is also made a little more complicated by our current strategy of sensitive calling + non-trivial filtering. But it would be great to come up with some hard constraints (e.g., we never want runtime/cost to exceed X, we always want to maintain Y metrics in these regions on these samples) and general procedures, then apply them as equitably as possible across all method/parameter changes. Also generally, I'm a bit wary of focusing too hard on the high-confidence regions, as this might lead to overfitting or could understate the potential of method/parameter changes in more difficult regions. But probably we'll have to downweight the loss or do more manual checks in low-confidence regions until we improve truth resources there. One naive question, just want to double check: is it correct that the overall scaling of each set of SW parameters is inconsequential? E.g., if I multiply each by a constant, should I expect the same results? I would expect this to be the case (unless my hazy recollection of the details of SW scoring is off) and simple experiments bear this out, but I'm not sure if there are some edge cases or idiosyncrasies in our implementation or use of the scores that I might be missing.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5564#issuecomment-714570055:1002,down,downweight,1002,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5564#issuecomment-714570055,2,['down'],['downweight']

Availability,"@tedsharpe So we've addressed a bunch of the issues you've mentioned in the new htsjdk.beta reader apis. In particular we now optimize the decoding checks so that we only scan the beginning of the files exactly once and the give the necessary bytes to all available codecs. That should work in combination with your optimization to push down the filtering which makes a lot of sense as well. Lazily loading the indexes when you need to query for them is a good idea. I think the thought behind aggressively loading them was probably to handle potential errors up front instead of waiting until later, and it's confounded by the bad choice of automatically discovering indexes by default so the engine can't tell if there SHOULD be an index until it tries and fails to load it. We've also addressed that in the new APIs to give the client more control over how indexes are discovered which should allow for cleaner lazy loading and things like that.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8031#issuecomment-1364325181:256,avail,available,256,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8031#issuecomment-1364325181,3,"['avail', 'down', 'error']","['available', 'down', 'errors']"

Availability,"@vdauwera The tools are categorized and listed in the Google Spreadsheet above. It is waiting for you to assign tech leads to tools for documentation. One thing that @chandrans brought to my attention is that for BaseRecalibrator one of the parameters (`-bqsr`) actually causes an error. One can no longer generate the 2nd recalibration table with correction on the fly and instead must use the recalibrated BAM through BaseRecalibrator to generate the 2nd recal table for plotting. **This type of information is missing from the tool docs.** Furthermore, updates I made to the BQSR slidedeck (that showcase this `-bqsr` parameter) are based on information from a developer and this information turns out to be incorrect now (perhaps correct at some point in development?). Soooo, I think it may be prudent that those responsible for tool docs test the commands on data. - [4] Make sure the doc content enables Best Practices, e.g. plotting BQSR recalibration, and ; - [5] Test example commands to ensure they work. If they do not, make corrections and notate the change in application in the documentation.; - [6] Remember @vdauwera's plan to change the representation of parameters from camel to KEBAB case. Issue is <https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2596>. Geraldine would like your help to do this for the tools you are responsible for.

The PCR error model applied pre-pairHMM does not seem to always do the right thing. . This is explained in class TandemRepeatFinder JavaDoc (soon to be merged in). Moreover the code responsible to detect STR repeats seems rather inefficient doing multiple passes on the read bases for each position on the read when it seems that it must be possible to accomplish the same just doing at most one pass per possible STR length. This task is to fix the PCR artifact modeling issues evaluating whether there is at least no a drop in calling accuracy all. Also try to make the code more efficient. ---. @ldgauthier commented on [Tue Jul 21 2015](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1064#issuecomment-123431158). @yfarjoun and I just added a Palantir issue for this this morning -- should the analysis wait until you're done updating the code?. ---. @vruano commented on [Tue Jul 21 2015](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1064#issuecomment-123431971).

Availability,"@yfarjoun and I recently discovered the following artifact in 30 FFPE samples:. The artifact occurs in DNA transposons with sequence 5'[S1][ITR][transposase][ITR'][S2]3', where S1 and S2 are arbitrary flanking sequence, ITR and ITR' are the inverted tandem repeat and its reverse complement (on the *same* strand). The artifact occurs when FFPE damage in the ITR sequence disrupts base pairing, causing ITR to pair with ITR', thereby creating a single-strand loop. Then end-repair (that is, filling in the 3' underhang) copies sequence from S1 into S2, yielding an insertion artifact. We verified a few signatures of this artifact:; * The insertion is always on read 2; * the fragment size for any given artifact is constant + 2 * # of soft-clipped bases; * When the artifact occurs upstream (downstream) of the insertion it is on a forward (reverse) strand read.; * the fragments 3' and 5' sequences are reverse complements of each other.

The main `sample_info` table is then subset to the sample names in the supplied file and stored in the table `{export_prefix}__SAMPLES`.

Availability,"A few comments to add on to what we discussed in person:. I think the coverage distribution is indeed the correct summary statistic to model for this problem. Total coverage just doesn't provide enough information, but subsampling bins or fitting a per-bin bias model is overkill. However, I think a straightforward, self-contained modeling or masking approach (which need not rely on a mappability track) within the ploidy-determination tool is still quite feasible. I think that if we can easily solve the problem without requiring a mappability track then we should try to do it, as that is a relatively expensive resource to create. For example, some very naive hard filtering (red) of the histogram yields a peak that is easily fit by a negative binomial (green)---even a Poisson fit does not appear to bias the depth estimates, and certainly does not result in incorrect ploidy estimates:. ![masked_fit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/37863641-827a6e8a-2f37-11e8-83d5-cb4af32a898b.png). (Incidentally, it is helpful to plot on a log scale when checking the fit of these distributions.). This strategy also gives us a way to ignore low-level mosaicism or large germline events, which filtering on mappability may not address:. ![mosaic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/37863649-d0ac378c-2f37-11e8-8e98-45e1fa9a3d7a.png). So let's try to encapsulate changes to the ploidy tool. I agree that the histogram creation can be easily done on the Java side, to save on intermediate file writing. We can probably just cap the maximum bin to `k` and pass a samples x contig TSV where each entry is a vector with `k + 1` elements.

Availability,"A few recent bugs, which are all entirely my fault, came about because the liftover of gnomAD to hg38 (there is no official hg38 gnomAD yet) exposed some new edge cases, such as `AF=.` and `AF=0`, that caused errors. I suspect that you are seeing one that we hadn't found yet. Unfortunately, we do not have nearly validation on hg38. Here's what I will do: 1) correct our hg38 gnomAD to fix liftover artifacts and put this new resource in the GATK bucket. 2) Create a Firecloud workspace with a few hg38 samples in order to reproduce the error and to make sure future changes don't create new problems 3) try to fix the error because even if 1) works it's sloppy to rely on the fact that gnomAD won't have these edge cases.

Availability,"A quick look at the code results in the following finding:. The error message : `""SA-BWT inconsistency: seq_len is not the same.""` is generated in function `bwt_restore_sa()` defined in `bwt.c`, and resulted in an `abort()` call.; `bwt_restore_sa()` itself was called in `bwa_idx_load_bwt()` defined in `bwa.c`, when trying to restore the suffix array from a file with extension "".sa"". This function call is issued when bwa mem (in its main) tries to load the reference information. This happens before input are read. Because of the `abort()` call, letting the `BwaMem` class handle the error is difficult, so I would propose two possible solutions:; 1. changing the behavior of `BwaIndex` class, so that it eagerly loads the reference, and throws an `Java.lang.IOException` when this error is encountered. Of course this must lead to code duplication, i.e. copying a large part of index loading code from bwa itself and walk around`abort()`ing.; 2. ask @lh3 to change the behavior so that it will not `abort()` any more, but return a null pointer.

Availability,"A user on the GATK Forum submitted a request to make the INFO field easier to manipulate through creating a table. At the GATK Office Hours meeting 11/8, we discussed the two ideas and favored the first idea to make a new tool, similar to VariantsToTable, that would unpack the INFO field. This request was created from a contribution made by Shahryar Alavi on October 30, 2020 19:54 UTC. Link: [https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/community/posts/360073983291-VariantsToTable-not-extracting-INFO-sub-fields-#community\_comment\_360013343072](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/community/posts/360073983291-VariantsToTable-not-extracting-INFO-sub-fields-#community_comment_360013343072). \--. But MAF output is somewhat different from VCF; and I think the VCF output format is better for germline variant annotation. With Funcotator we get an integrated (and minuter) ""variant calling - annotation"" workflow. But the problem is ""vertical bar"" separated INFOs are not easy for downstream text processing. I have two suggestions for the GATK Team:. You may want to develop a new tool (like VariantsToTable) to separate each ""sub-info"" in the FUNCOTATION INFO, and put them into separate columns with corresponding headers when creating the tab-delimited table. Or add a feature to Funcotator to create multiple INFOs with FUNCOTATION prefix in their IDs; e.g. #INFO=<ID=FUNCOTATION\\\_Gencode\\\_34\\\_hugoSymbol,...> ; ; #INFO=<ID=FUNCOTATION\\\_Gencode\\\_34\\\_ncbiBuild,...>. instead of. #INFO=<ID=FUNCOTATION,...,Description=""Funcotation fields are: Gencode\\\_34\\\_hugoSymbol|Gencode\\\_34\\\_ncbiBuild|..."">.

Availability,"Actually, I'm going to go ahead and add some exact match tests to guard against this sort of thing. Behavior for key somatic CNV tool modules (i.e., kernel segmentation and MCMC) is unit tested to within statistical noise (so, not exact match) on simulated data, but most integration tests just check for plumbing and not correctness. The idea was always that this sort of thing would be covered by what eventually became CARROT, since such tests would probably have to be long running and require more resources than are available in the repo to be useful. See the high priority but long dormant issues https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4122 and https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4123, as well as https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4630. In fact, I think the original idea was that Lee's validation would be the first to go into CARROT. Note also that I did some work to set up transition of all existing CNV tests (also including the somatic CNV validation against TCGA SNP calls that I put together on Terra) before going on leave and moving off CNVs, but during all that, we managed to 1) lose TCGA access, 2) delete the test files on which Lee based his validation after he left, and 3) reassign at least one of the people that was going to help with the transition. Again, the resulting differences here are minor and it's unlikely that future non-CNV code changes will have similar effects, since the CNV code is relatively well encapsulated, but the exact-match checks will hopefully give us some peace of mind until CARROT tests are ready. @jonn-smith @KevinCLydon looping you in just in case you're not aware of all of this history.

Availability,"Adding in the option for using a compressed representation of our reference data. The flag use_compressed_references needs to be passed into ingest and also export, and doing so causes us to use a different internal schema for the ref_ranges table that can save ~40% on space. On the VCF path, the packed data is expanded while we populate the prepare tables before extract. On the VDS path, the packed data is expanded while we extract from the tables to create the Avro files. I updated integration tests to take use_compressed_refs as an option, and saw what I needed. Integrations tests for the VCF and VDS paths go to completion and fail, but in the expected way. AssertIdenticalOutputs, the important part, passes. AssertTableSizesAreExpected fails because the ref_ranges table is so much smaller (255884464 vs 431805033 expected) and AssertCostIsTrackedAndExpected fails because the PrepareRangesCallsetTask.GvsPrepareRanges.BigQuery Query Scanned is similarly smaller (340787200 vs 515899392). Given the nature of the change and the fact that it is an optional flag that defaults to zero, updating the integration tests to cover this path did not seem sound at this time.

Availability,"Addresses #6242. Current behavior: when all the reads in a read group are filtered in the base recalibration step, the read group is not logged in the recal table. Then ApplyBQSR encounters these reads, can't find the read group in the recal table, and throws an error. New behavior: if `--allow-read-group` flag is set to true, then ApplyBQSR outputs the original quantities (after quantizing). . I avoided the alternative approach of collapsing (marginalizing) across the read groups, mostly because it would require a complete overhaul of the code. I also think that using recal data from other read groups might not be a good idea. In any case, using OQ should be good enough; I assume that these ""missing"" read groups are low enough quality to be filtered out and are likely to be thrown out by downstream tools. I also refactored the BQSR code, mostly to update the variable and class names to be more accurate and descriptive. For instance:.

Availability,"After looking more at the data from an hg38 NovaSeq run by @kcibul, I think a better strategy would be to use the normal allelic counts as a prior on whether a site is homozygous, rather than hard filtering on these sites (and pulling down corresponding counts from the tumor---this strategy was held over from GetHetCoverage/AllelicCapSeg). The main reason is that the normal will typically be sequenced at lower coverage (~30x), so this strategy will cause us to miss obvious hets in the tumor (~80x). This is now relevant for two reasons: 1) it seems that we will want to run the filter with more stringent parameters, as higher base error rates are causing homs to leak past the filter, which in turn affects the fit of the allele-fraction model (which only attempts to model hets) by biasing normal segments towards unbalanced, and 2) we now want to run ModelSegments separately on the normal to allow for the filtering of germline events. So we want to be more stringent with low-coverage normals without affecting our high-coverage tumors. For example, here's some hg38 NovaSeq FFPE WGS data from a ~40x normal:. ![download](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/43977946-9bd0a1bc-9cb3-11e8-9d7f-016a99c1c173.png).

The hom-ref tail in the first plot is much fatter and clearly leaks into the het cloud. Also curious is that the het cloud is far less binomial (or even beta-binomial---note also the absence of the tail extending to the origin). I am still not sure why the incoming data looks different. There are several confounding factors: NovaSeq vs. HiSeq, hg38 vs. hg19, AF > 2% gnomAD sites vs. AF > 10% 1000G sites, FFPE vs. frozen, etc. I have not seen enough examples/combinations to be able to say which are the most important factors.

Availability,"After more experimentation, one issue I was running into with the ApproxKernSeg method was failure on small and ""epidemic"" events. This is because 1) the segment cost function used in that paper is extensive (growing with the number of points in a segment), and 2) binary segmentation is a global, greedy algorithm. These both cause long events to be preferred over short events, and thus the first changepoints found (and retained after applying the penalty) may not include those for small, obvious events. For example, see performance on this simulated data, which includes events of size 10, 20, 30, and 40 within 100,000 points at S/N ratio 3:1 in addition to sine waves of various frequency at S/N ratio 1:2 (to roughly simulate GC waves). Changepoints arising from the sine waves will be found first, since these give rise to longer segments:. ![wave-kern-no-local](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/29322673-4dd9a1ac-81ac-11e7-94f5-5c5494e44ac5.png).

However, when we tune down the sine waves to 1:10, ApproxKernSeg still gets tripped up, but CBS looks better:. ![wave-kern-no-local-small-waves](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/29322732-815df58c-81ac-11e7-8305-6e1798616336.png); ![wave-cbs-small-waves](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/29322737-836b78fe-81ac-11e7-93be-753a40011203.png). To improve ApproxKernSeg, we can 1) make the cost function intensive, by simply dividing by the number of points in a segment, and 2) add to the cost function a local term, given by the cost of making each point a changepoint within a local window of a determined size. This local term was inspired by methods such as SaRa (http://c2s2.yale.edu/software/sara/).

Note that some of those changes are in code that you moved (i.e., into the new ArgumentCollection class) so they'll have to be propagated to the new code. . Also, the (non VariantEval) test failures in this branch are fallout from the change to add the source to the VariantContexts.

In principle, IGV should be able to handle linear scaling, but it scales automatically for seg files and I'm not sure if you can get around it without some additional steps. Seems easier to just output log2 copy ratios. (Perhaps we initially output linear copy ratios to maintain backwards compatibility with previous versions of GATK CNV? If so, the *LegacySegmentCollections seem to be pulling double duty, since we use them to provide IGV compatibility.

Availability,"Also extracted some argument collections and genotyping code (see https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3915), fixed up some documentation, and did some refactoring to the Segmenter classes. This is just a first implementation for evaluation and feedback. There is some redundant (but cheap) computation performed in the genotyping step and both the genotyping and segmentation steps are not optimized for memory use. However, since requirements are not onerous (probably around ~10GB memory and <10 minutes for ~10 typical WGS samples), it might not be worth fixing up at the expense of extra code. Likewise, this implementation requires all inputs be available. We could relax this to allow optional dimensions of input (i.e., copy ratios or allele counts) and/or case-only mode (as in ModelSegments), at the expense of extra control-flow code. One could also perform segmentation with an external tool and pass it to ModelSegments, as long as it is properly formatted.

Availability,"Also fixed some minor style issues in argument variable names and the WDL. This should help recover some deletions and might possibly clear up some issues with MAF estimation when the number of hets is small. @LeeTL1220 can you run on some test cases to check the effect? (Note that the changes to fix estimation of the posterior widths, which will in turn affect similar-segment smoothing, are in another branch; we should test those changes as well.). Note that the default threshold of zero for the tumor in matched-normal mode should ensure that the sites genotyped as het should always match in the tumor and the normal. (This will ultimately make multisample segmentation, as enabled by #5524, more straightforward.) There was previously a check for this condition in the integration test; however, it wasn't actually activated by the test data. I could modify the test data to add a proper regression test, but since these test files are generated by running another tool on a test BAM in the repo, this could be misleading.

Availability,"Any objections to exposing SW parameters to the command line? This looks like something we will want to explore for malaria. I'm also not convinced that our current parameters have been justified and/or optimized in any documented way. A few questions:. 1) There are 3 sets of parameters used in various ways, a) haplotype-to-reference alignment, b) read-to-haplotype alignment, and c) dangling ends. Any chance we can evaluate the effect of consolidating at least c), if not all sets? @emeryj I was told that you might be the one to ask about c) in particular; @davidbenjamin speculated that these might effectively yield STR-specific parameters. In general, if there are any quick and readily available evaluations (which ideally include variant normalization), I'd appreciate pointers to them. 2) Any suggestions on what the resulting command line should look like? I don't want to add 12 parameters, in the worst case. I also think that using integer arrays might be clunky. Perhaps I can suggest the use of args files in the doc string---although I don't think that those are expanded in the `##GATKCommandLine`, right?. 3) Should I touch `SWOverhangStrategy` at all? See e.g. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6576. It looks like we thread both this and the `SWParameters` through many methods and classes, so the code could stand quite a bit of refactoring, but for now I will stick to the minimal changes required to expose. @droazen @ldgauthier any thoughts?. In some simple experiments of changing the a) parameters (from the somewhat questionable `NEW_SW_PARAMETERS = new SWParameters(200, -150, -260, -11)` back to `STANDARD_NGS = new SWParameters(25, -50, -110, -6)`), I've seen that there are non-negligible differences in the calls (beyond representation) at the few percent level, as well as changes in annotations.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6863:695,avail,available,695,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6863,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"As a step toward productionizing gCNV, I explore the idea of aggressive filtering of reads (or targets, or bins) based on known annotations, such as genome mappability, complexity, SINEs, LINEs, repeats, etc. This post is about mappability filtering, and in particular, for WGS samples. Let us consider coverage data collected by `CollectFragmentCounts` (default tool args: well-formed paired, FR orientation, MQ > 30) for a several WGS samples (hg38, BWA-MEM). Here's how the coverage distribution looks like for a random sample:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15305869/37785053-8c9ca298-2dcf-11e8-9eb4-20192af80647.png). Notice the main peak at ~ 90 fragments/bin, the diffuse counts below 90, and the peak at 0. To proceed, I calculated the average mappability score of each bin using the recently published [multi-read Umap track](https://bismap.hoffmanlab.org/). It is not an ideal mappability scoring scheme (since it does not consider Illumina-like errors and paired-end reads), but it is the best I could find for hg38. I filtered out all bins that had a mappability score short of 100% (very aggressive). Here's how the filtered coverage distribution looks like:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15305869/37785397-6c8052ba-2dd0-11e8-9fed-f8f1aa4406cf.png). Evidently, the diffusive low coverage part of the distribution has completely disappeared, along with the peak at 0. Here's a plot of the number of _retained bins_ after filtering with various mean mappability cutoffs:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15305869/37785471-9d155920-2dd0-11e8-87bf-b8fb579250ff.png). Except for chrY, the most aggressive filtering only gets rid of 20% of the genome. Let us fit different distributions to the filtered coverage data:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15305869/37785506-b80a4790-2dd0-11e8-97e4-9bff775a93ce.png).

One important think is that the `intervalsForTraversal` is not used at all, so it is up to the author discard regions out of this ones. I was thinking to check every position for overlap in any of the interval in the list, but I'm not sure if the `intervalsForTraversal` is sorted or not; and an exhaustive checking could reduce performance.

Availability,"As determined by @davidadamsphd , the `Copyable` interface idea won't work:. The recommendation from the Dataflow team was to make a narrow API and do the copying part of the API. I started down this route, and I think it might be doable for things like the walker interface. The idea is to make a Copyable interface and have our interfaces extend that. . However, we have unsafe code already in the engine. I tried to make this SafeDoFn approach, however it became clear quickly that we'd have a combinatorial explosion of classes because we don't just have `DoFn<GATKRead,POut>`, but also `<Iterable<GATKRead>,POut>`, and many others. So, this approach will not work for the engine. I then tried to make a general purpose solution (using coders to write to bytes and then recreate a new class). This doesn't work for a few reasons, most critical is that the coder registry isn't Serializable, so that can't be passed down deep enough to get this to work. While working on this, I chatted with someone on the Dataflow team who is working on the verification on the direct runner. He has a PR out and likely going to get it approved soon. So, for the engine, we could always test using the direct runner and know for sure there are not issues (once we can use his code). However, there are two downsides:. 1) We will need to wait for a cut of the SDK (which looking at their previous clip is likely ~ two weeks away). . 2) I don't know if we want the direct runner test as our general purpose solution. Can we expect Comp Bios to always test with the direct runner first?

Availability,"As we discussed, it's possible that these are simply common germline CNVs that are being median-normalized out in CR by the PoN. Let's investigate the sample-median-normalized counts in some of the questionable regions, along with the per-bin medians in the PoN. I do not think a gCNV run is necessary (it will probably be a bit expensive, anyway). More generally, I think a better approach to germline tagging would be to avoid the caller entirely. Let's take the ModelSegments output for a normal, and then tag ModelSegments segments in the tumor that sufficiently overlap any normal segment in CR-AF-genomic space (where we have some freedom to define the overlap criteria). Essentially, let's just try to highlight differences between the tumor and normal in CR-AF space. This would rescue events in the normal that may be further amplified or deleted in the tumor. Subsequently, simple filtering of these events would be less misleading than imputation. I do not think such tagging should be implemented in Java, if we can avoid it. Rather, a relatively simple python script that runs through each tumor segment and checks for overlaps would suffice. This script could output a tagged/filtered ModelSegments result, as well as do the conversion step for downstream tools. This also obviates the need for the Java code for combining segment breakpoints and additional CNV collection classes in the current post-processing tools.

Availability,"At the moment, ReadTools only documents and use `ReadFilters` but I am planning to probably add pack a couple of tools from the GATK/Picard tools at some point. In addition, I am working on another toolkit based on the GATK code, and it will include also annotations for variants (and probably some VCF tools). I just thought that it will be useful to been able to pull out the super-category map to re-use the GATK docgen code. If a downstream project with extra-categories wants to use the GATK templates and DocGen code might get into troubles without being able to access that. I am still working on how to document better my toolkits, but it is not a problem yet. Anyway, I don't really have any strong feeling about this; I just wanted to reduce a bit the complexity of the GATK code and do the same with my downstream projects.

Availability,"Based on my HaplotypeCaller GVCF performance evaluation, we are spending a significant amount of time in `ReferenceConfidenceModel.calcNIndelInformativeReads()', including upwards of 40% of the overall runtime on a bam under some conditions. To this end we have already done some performance work optimizing its constituent methods (#5469, #5470). Even with those changes it appears that the method can take upwards of 25% of the total runtime, which appears to be a consequence of the nature of the algorithm. It appears that the core of the problem appears to be associated with the calls we make to `isReadInformativeAboutIndelsOfSize()` which has a complexity overall of approximately `O(pileupsPerRegion * readsPerPileup * basesPerRead * maxIndelSize)` which ends up being a large number. One approach to fixing this problem be to rethink the repetitive operations we do for every pileup and instead do it on a per-read basis, and furthermore we could exploit the nature of the existing algorithm to avoid checking mismatches at the front of the read when we know that down the line we will fail out because of mismatches at the end of the read. Furthermore there is the broader philisophical question of whether there are changes that could be made to the algorithm that might carry a bigger risk of changing the results, like applying some heuristic based on the complexity of the reference sequence at a given site to reduce the amount of work we have to do.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5488:1074,down,down,1074,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5488,1,['down'],['down']

You mentioned needing to use smaller batch sizes...were you otherwise seeing larger memory overheads than before? Or just general slower performance?. There is a new `--bypass-feature-reader` option in the latest release that should help with dramatically lowering memory usage, and potentially offering a slight speedup for imports. Might be worth a shot. edit: you mentioned consolidate, so I should also add that consolidate is expected to help with read performance (shouldn't affect import) after we've had a fair number of batches imported (left intentionally vague.

Availability,Bug on 4.0.0.0 reported on forum -- please advise how to proceed @droazen @lbergelson. ---. Ok now things are getting more interesting. Disabling intelflaters seems to solve the problem. But why?. Same flaters work with standalone picard as well and they don't have any issues. Compression level does not change anything. Is this a memory allocation error? I don't think so because it does not segfault. The error message says filename not found. . I am wondering if this has anything to do with meltdown patches. Both of my systems (Ubuntu and macOS) are patched against meltdown bug. And Intel flaters are causing this issue. But this won't explain why standalone picard is still working fine with them. The only explanation that I have is the difference between HTSJDK and GKL versions between standalone picard 2.17.2 and embedded picard 2.17.2 in gatk. The latest HTSJDK update for standalone picard mentions 2.13.1 version but the one in gatk 4.0 is 2.13.2 I believe. I don't have the info about GKL version used in them. .

Availability,"Can you give a bit more information here? If I'm understanding correctly, it's not clear that the same issue is at play here. The original issue was that duplicate/incomplete fragments were causing queries to the workspace to fail. . In this latest instance, it seems you are appending additional samples to the existing workspace. Is that right? If so,; - are you seeing the same/similar error? That is, it's a core dump? Can you share the error messages, any logs, core dump files etc?; - did you clean up the workspace before importing? That is, remove the incomplete fragment @nalinigans identified and the duplicated ones?. My first instinct is that even if the incomplete/duplicated fragments weren't cleaned up, the incremental import shouldn't have an issue -- at least not till it gets to the consolidate phase, which only happens after all batches are imported. Sounds like you were seeing an issue at batch 3 of 4, so might have something to do with the samples in that batch...or some other import issue. You mentioned that previous imports to this particular contig failed -- were those just transient failures that worked when rerun, or was there some configuration that you changed to get that to work?. For completeness, the way I identified duplicate fragments was to do an md5sum check on some of the internal files. If any pair of fragments have the same md5sum they are likely duplicates. So, from the workspace directory, something like:. ```; find . -name ""ALT.tdb"" -exec md5sum {} \;|sort; ```; That will highlight the fragments that are potentially duplicate. To confirm that the fragments are indeed duplicates, you'll then want to take that list of potentially duplicate fragments and check that all corresponding files within each pair of potentially duplicate fragments actually have the same md5sum.

Availability,"Closes #4782 ; Closes #5959. We should discuss a few issues, and modify/cleanup if necessary, before this goes in (if it does at all). In particular, I'd like to understand the original intent behind using the /root directory (e.g., in all of our WDLs) and make sure we don't break typical downstream uses by instead using /gatk; we could even consider ""deprecating"" this over a few releases. I think it's also worth discussing whether we want to continue to release a rootful image, but perhaps parameterize the Docker build script to easily allow the building of an image with a non-root user. I must admit that I don't have good visibility on the various use cases of our Dockers (outside of our typical use with Terra/Cromwell), so if any users would like to chime in, that would certainly be appreciated. In particular, users may still have to do some work on their end to remap user namespaces. In any case, this is at least a proof-of-principle that mounting resources is possible within our test framework with the option for a non-root user. So unless we have other good reasons for requiring a root user, it seems worthwhile to at least allow this option, even if we don't make that the new default.

Availability,"Cromwell still struggles with call caching and metadata bloat in our gCNV workflows. Specific improvements to reduce overhead will modify scattered tasks:. 1. `GermlineCNVCallerCohort(Case)Mode` - Replace input `Array[File] read_count_files` with a list of files, i.e. `File read_count_file_paths`. This should be generated using `WritePathList`, rather than using `write_lines()` which does not function in WDL workflow blocks on some Cromwell servers. Replace output `Array[File] gcnv_call_tars` with a single tarball `File gcnv_call_tar` containing all of the calls. It appears there are a number of redundant outputs - kernel version, denoising configs, output file lists, etc. that were added with the [joint calling pipeline](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/31df35bb9204b5551cc1a3ee7468e2b0e577215d). We should rework that to extract/generate those in joint calling workflow when needed and eliminate these outputs.; 2. Add a transpose task following `GermlineCNVCallerCohort(Case)Mode` that consumes the interval-sharded `Array[File] gcnv_call_tar` output, and generates a sample-sharded `Array[File] gcnv_calls_by_sample` output of tarballs.; 2. Add a model bundling task following `GermlineCNVCallerCohort(Case)Mode` that consumes the interval-sharded `Array[File] gcnv_model_tar` output, extracts the files, and tarballs all of them together to produce a single tarball output. Make this the output of the cohort workflow and input to the case mode workflows, rather than an array of model tars (retain the current `Array[File]` input as an optional type `Array[File]?` that will be used as the default if provided to case mode in order to support users still working with the old paradigm).; 3. `PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls` - replace input `Array[File] gcnv_calls_tars` with `File gcnv_sample_calls`, the sample-sharded output from the aforementioned transpose task.

We should provide a mode in `IntervalArgumentCollection` in which intervals can be parsed into `SimpleIntervals` without a sequence dictionary. This will require us to fill in a special value such as `Integer.MAX_VALUE` for the stop position of intervals that don't contain a stop position (eg., ""chr1"" or ""chr1:1+""), since we won't know the true contig lengths, but our future query interfaces should all be robust to requests for locations outside of contig boundaries (and not blow up given such requests).

Availability,"Dear @davidbenjamin and @droazen,. please find [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/files/12196051/2023-06-21.ISMB.Poster.on.XOP.Variant.Calling.Workflow.and.Mutect2.SES.v3.pdf) the poster that we presented this Monday at ISMB 2023 in Lyon. It sheds some additional light on this issue and explains why we believe that fine-tuning of the error model introduced in Mutect2 4.1.9.0 led to overcalling of variants in samples with increased (but not pathologic) DNA degradation. Presentation of the poster led to several interesting discussions with other users of Mutect2 at the conference. Given these results, I would propose that you could expose the parameter you newly set in commit [a304725](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/a304725a60f5000ec6381040137043a557fc3dc1) `private static final int ONE_THIRD_QUAL_CORRECTION = 5;` as a user-facing command line parameter. In this manner, you could leave the parameter at `5` by default but allow users who work on clinical (especially FFPE) samples to change it to `0` instead, thus effectively restoring the behaviour shown (and benchmarked) prior to 4.1.9.0.

Availability,"Debugging update: the issue in this case seems to be that HaplotypeCaller constructs an additional haplotype containing a fifth variant a little bit downstream of the four called variants. The fifth variant has low read support and is not called, but matches the reference base at all of the four called positions and so is out of phase with both of the possible phase sets suggested by the four called variants. This causes the current phasing algorithm to give up, as it requires all of the haplotypes containing alternate alleles at a locus to agree with one of the phase sets it creates. . A possible solution I am exploring is to exclude haplotypes that don't have any called non-ref alleles from the set of `calledHaplotypes` passed to `AssemblyBasedCallerUtils.phaseCalls` by `HaplotypeCallerGenotypingEngine`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6845#issuecomment-712901830:149,down,downstream,149,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6845#issuecomment-712901830,1,['down'],['downstream']

Availability,"DepthOfCoverage ; DiagnoseTargets . From @vdauwera ; It would probably make sense to write one really good tool for coverage analysis to replace these two. DoC is great at providing per-locus coverage counts, and the main output table is straightforward and easy for downstream scripts to consume. The summary results table is also ok. But the functionality for aggregating results over intervals and refseq gene lists is super confusing; intervals and genelists interact in an counterintuitive way, and the refseq format requirements are a little vague. In contrast, DT is great at providing per-interval results that give you a go/no-go for callability (+ a culprit metric e.g. MAPQ0, DP etc. in case of a no-go call), but the output is terrible (a pseudo-VCF, which users dont like) and it does not give any per-site counts.

On a Google Colab instance (which I believe are n1-highmem-2s), 150 iterations (which I think is the current maximum) completed in 14 minutes, with `%memit` reporting a memory peak of ~1.5GB. Note that convergence within the default tolerance isn't actually reached in 150 iterations for this toy data (as usual, it takes a while for the weights of unused components to shrink to zero). In any case, we'd have to compare against the number of iterations currently required to converge with the real data (and perhaps also check that the convergence criteria match up) to get a better idea of real runtime. Various tweaks to priors or other runtime options (such as k-means vs. random initialization) could also affect convergence speed.

Availability,"Did some more thinking about this issue. Ideally, we'd drop all -L bins that overlap at all with any -XL regions, then check that the remaining bins are a subset of the annotated intervals and/or count files, if available. This seems most natural, in that -L/-XL would specify the desired set of intervals for filtering, and we'd fail if all of these are not available in the other inputs. However, due to the way intervals are resolved by the engine, I don't think it's easy to identify which bins overlap with -XL regions---the engine will instead split bins and retain the parts that don't overlap. So alternatively, if we assume that in typical use the annotated intervals and count files will contain the desired intervals as a subset, we can simply take the intersection of all intervals to drop these partial bins. However, if a user screws up and provides annotated intervals or count files with bins that don't match those specified via -L, then we don't really have a good strategy for failing---probably the only fair check we can do is fail if no bins remain after intersection. If we assume that users will typically be using or following the WDL, I think I'm OK with the second strategy.

Availability,"Disclaimer: I'm a programmer with very little GATK experience. The problem is that you've got AMD libraries on a PowerPC machine. I don't; know if GATK makes PowerPC libraries available natively, but you should be; able to get the source code and compile it yourself. Note that this will not fix the problem of your machine architecture; lacking the AVX instruction set. That's a hardware issue. But it should; (okay, *might*) get rid of the warnings about missing .so files. As an aside, I'm curious whether PowerPC architecture has an instruction; set similar to AVX. This is something I might actually be able to; contribute to the project so I'm excited by the prospect!. -Dan.

It does not change for 2, 5, 25, etc and if given these non-one numbers, behaves as if it is set to zero, without any exception nor error.

Root cause:; At the first MAF iteration where errorDepth is greater than oppositeDepth, contamination is set to “0” (according to the code logic shown below), the function exits the iteration process, and no further MAF thresholds are tested. **contaminationOppositeDepth = Math.max(oppositeDepth - errorDepth, 0);**; **contamination = contaminationOppositeDepth / totalDepthWeightedByOppositeFrequency**. Solution proposed:; Currently, when errorDepth is greater than oppositeDepth, the output contamination is reported as **’0’ contamination**; it seems to us that this should instead be interpreted as **“unable to calculate contamination”** because of the high error rate in these pileups. Improvements for current version:; In addition, we suggest calculating all contamination values over all strategies/iterations and outputting the highest contamination value (by MAF and/or strategy, as appropriate), rather than exiting after the first MAF iteration where stdError exit condition is met. ### Description what needs to be added or modified; Please see the code change attached, compare it to 4.2.0.0.

Some curation of the samples could be performed; some batch effects were observed in some LC WGS LUAD samples. Comparisons to other tools will probably be removed for ease of maintenance.

Availability,"Every overlapping read pair in HaplotypeCaller and Mutect2 ; goes through `FragmentUtils.adjustQualsOfOverlappingPairedFragments`, which has the following *hard-coded* logic:. ```; if ( firstReadBase == secondReadBase ) {; firstReadQuals[firstReadIndex] = Math.min(firstReadQuals[firstReadIndex], HALF_OF_DEFAULT_PCR_ERROR_QUAL);; secondReadQuals[i] = Math.min(secondReadQuals[i], HALF_OF_DEFAULT_PCR_ERROR_QUAL);; } else {; firstReadQuals[firstReadIndex] = 0;; secondReadQuals[i] = 0;; }; ```. This makes sense -- we modify the quals to reflect that sequencing errors are independent but PCR errors are not. However, `HALF_OF_DEFAULT_PCR_ERROR_QUAL` is 20, so if we start out with high-quality UMI reads we basically kill the quality and with it our SNV sensitivity. Note that in the very important application of cfDNA basically every base is an overlap. What's worse is that Mutect2 later throws out one of the reads, so that we could start out with two BQ = 60 reads and end up with one BQ = 20 read!. @fleharty @yfarjoun This is a problem.

Availability,"ExtractVariantAnnotations:. This tool extracts annotations, labels, and other relevant metadata from variants (or alleles, in allele-specific mode) that do or do not overlap with specified resources. The former are considered labeled and each variant/allele can have multiple labels. The latter are considered unlabeled and can be randomly downsampled using reservoir sampling; extraction of these is optional. The outputs of the tool are HDF5 files containing the extracted data for labeled and (optional) unlabeled variant sets, as well as a sites-only VCF containing the labeled variants. This VCF can be used in ScoreVariantAnnotations to in turn specify an additional ""extracted"" label, which can be useful for indicating those sites that were actually extracted from the provided resources (since we may only extract over a subset of the genome). TODOs:; - [x] Integration tests. Putting together tests using chr1:1-10M snippets of 1) the 1kgp-50-exomes sites-only VCF for the input (since this has both non-AS and AS annotations; EDIT: Scratch that, it only has AS_InbreedingCoeff and AS_QD), 2) the Omni SNP training/truth VCF (yielding ~3.5k training), and 3) the Mills training/truth VCF (yielding ~500 training). Incidentally, VariantRecalibrator SNP and INDEL runs both fail to converge on these small training sets without the #7709 fix, but do converge with it. I still need to check if enough multiallelics are included here; if not, I'll choose a different snippet. EDITEDIT: Now using gs://broad-gotc-test-storage/joint_genotyping/exome/scientific/truth/master/gather_vcfs_high_memory/small_callset_low_threshold.vcf.gz provided by @ldgauthier, which does have AS annotations.; ; We'll use expected outputs here as inputs to downstream steps, but rather than provide the expected outputs directly, we'll create copies of them and provide those as inputs.

Availability,"FeatureManager dynamically discovers all `FeatureInput` arguments in a tool by accepting a (pre-populated) CommandLineProgram object, which it then passes to static methods in Barclay. Those methods perform the same `@Argument`/`@ArgumentCollection` discovery already implemented by the parser, but using separate, out-of-date code paths that currently don't discover `@PositionalArguments` or plugin descriptor arguments. Rather than fixing the redundant code paths and static methods in Barclay, they can be eliminated and replaced with an instance method on the parser. Since FeatureManager already requires that the parser have been run on the tool, the parser already has the state necessary to just collect the results. However, this means that FeatureManager would require a CommandLineParser object instead of the tool itself.

Availability,"First cut at a rewrite seems to be working fine and is much, much leaner. Building a small PoN with 4 simulated normals with 5M bins each, CombineReadCounts took ~1 min, CreatePanelOfNormals (with no QC) took ~4.5 minutes (although ~1 minute of this is writing target weights, which I haven't added to the new version yet) and generated a 2.7GB PoN, and NormalizeSomaticReadCounts took ~8 minutes (~7.5 minutes of which was spent composing/writing results, thanks to overhead from ReadCountCollection). In comparison, the new CreateReadCountPanelOfNormals took ~1 minute (which includes combining read-count files, which takes ~30s of I/O) and generated a 520MB PoN, and DenoiseReadCounts took ~30s (~10s of which was composing/writing results, as we are still forced to generate two ReadCountCollections). Resulting PTN and TN copy ratios were identical down to 1E-16 levels. Differences are only due to removing the unnecessary pseudoinverse computation. Results after filtering and before SVD are identical, despite the code being rewritten from scratch to be more memory efficient (e.g., filtering is performed in place)---phew!. If we stored read counts as HDF5 instead of as plain text, this would make things much faster. Perhaps it would be best to make TSV an optional output of the new coverage collection tool. As a bonus, it would then only take a little bit more code to allow previous PoNs to be provided via -I as an additional source of read counts. Remaining TODO's:. - [x] Allow DenoiseReadCounts to be run without a PoN. This will just perform standardization and optional GC correction. This gives us the ability to run the case sample pipeline without a PoN, which will give users more options and might be good enough if the data is not too noisy.; - [x] Actually, I'm not sure why we take perform SVD on the intervals x samples matrix and take the left-singular vectors. <s>Typically, SVD is performed on the samples x intervals matrix and the right-singular vectors are taken, ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-316894351:855,down,down,855,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-316894351,2,['down'],['down']

Availability,"First of all, thank you so much for your hard work! I am excited to explore GATK 4.0.0.0.; I would like to report minor issues in setting up optional dependencies for GATK4. First, `gatkcondaenv.yml` defines `gatkPythonPackageArchive.zip` location as; `build/gatkPythonPackageArchive.zip`; The path doesn't seem to work seamlessly with the release archive, though the path makes sense in the root directory of source repo. Unzipping the package file locates both files in the same directory and, to me, it is natural to create the conda environment in the directory. Second, it would be more convenient to include `install_R_packages.R` in the release like gatkcondaenv.yml for python dependencies. Also, I had an issue running `install_R_packages.R` for fresh compiled R-3.2.5. The way `install_R_packages.R` install `optparse` prevents its dependency (the getopt package) from being automatically installed, because (I guess) repos argument is set to NULL. I think the helper script needs to install the getopt package as well.; ```; optparseUrl=""http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/optparse/optparse_1.3.2.tar.gz""; if (!(""optparse"" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) {; install.packages(optparseUrl, repos=NULL, type=""source""); }; ```. Finally, it would be convenient to depend on a R version available in conda, so that R dependency can be a part of the gatk conda environment. I wasn't able to get the recommended R-3.2.5 from conda.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4209:1309,avail,available,1309,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4209,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"First to clarify, GetPileupSummaries and CollectAllelicCounts tabulate ALT vs. REF counts at SNP sites. These tools do not consider anything larger than 1bp at a time and are basically akin to pileup callers. File size is a sacrifice that I would trade for easy parsing of the data, which the plethora of VCF tools available enable. . - If the unconventionality is the issue, then consider Heng's use of the SAM format for the ALT reference file. He unconventionally uses the format to store CIGAR strings of ALT/HLA/DECOY contigs mapped back to the primary assembly. This file is easy to parse with samtools. @mwalker174's comment gives me an idea. If we need a format that stores intervals, or _blocks_, then we already have one--the GVCF format. This format is already compatible with IGV. Here's an example record:; ```; chr1 58999897 . T <NON_REF> . . END=58999902 GT:DP:GQ:MIN_DP:PL0/0:31:90:31:0,90,1350; ```; The `END` value is interpreted by IGV as the end of the block and the GVCF format is recognized as a valid VCF format, one that uses a symbolic allele demarcated with `<...>`. Symbolic allele representations are described as early as [VCF v4.1 specs](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/) and expanded upon in v4.3 specs. I think @jonn-smith you refer to MAF-format functional annotations. Yes? Here we are discussing much less complex variant call level annotations like genotype that would have a few associated numerical values, e.g. 10th, 50th, and 90th confidence interval allele fractions AND copy ratio value for each CN segment. . One last thing of interest towards visualization. I've been reminded recently of some open-source software that is a standard in visualizing somatic data for the biologist in the Cancer Genetics field--[CBioPortal](http://www.cbioportal.org/index.do?cancer_study_id=blca_mskcc_solit_2014&Z_SCORE_THRESHOLD=2.0&RPPA_SCORE_THRESHOLD=2.0&data_priority=0&case_set_id=blca_mskcc_solit_2014_cnaseq&gene_list=RB1%2520RBL1%2520RBL2%2520CCNA1%2520CCNB1%",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4717#issuecomment-386386120:315,avail,available,315,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4717#issuecomment-386386120,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"Fixes a bug that I inadvertently introduced long ago in #5408. A method there originally assumed that the intervals to be filtered coincide with the annotated intervals when filtering on annotations, but this assumption can be violated when e.g. using `-XL` to further exclude intervals. This breaks the annotation-based filtering and will result in incorrectly retained/dropped intervals. Unfortunately, the integration test cases were not quite complete enough to catch this. Fortunately, for typical data and parameters, the number of affected intervals is typically a very small percentage, especially in human (e.g., the default GC filters of [0.1, 0.9] affect <0.1% of 250bp bins); I only caught this when running on malaria data, since GC filtering has more impact there. I would also expect count-based filters to mitigate some of the effects (e.g., a bin with extreme GC that was erroneously retained when filtering on annotations might later be filtered because it has poor coverage). Downstream results are also all correct---they're just given for a slightly different set of intervals than would be expected. This bug would affect users that made use of the `blacklist_intervals_for_filter_intervals` option in the gCNV WDLs, but my feeling is this functionality is not used that frequently. @droazen I think this is a relatively minor bug, but it might be good to mention it in the release notes.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7046:995,Down,Downstream,995,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7046,1,['Down'],['Downstream']

MergeVCFs as well as GatherVCFs, allows duplicate calls in the final VCF without checks. GatherVCFs does not allow for out-of-genomic-order-inputs and will give an error.

Availability,"From @cmnbroad:. The write side for non-coordinate sorted CRAMs works now, but there is still a problem with reading queryname sorted input crams with unmapped reads. There is an existing test in GATK for this case that is already enabled and has been passing, but only because there is another bug in the test code that is masking the failure because it uses the value ""outputExtension"", which results in a BAM file being created. When I went to fix that as part of re-enabling the disabled CRAM tests, the verification of the queryname test output now fails. The test itself runs, but the samsEqualStringent verification fails reading the output. So the write-side issues with the presorted flag are fixed with samtools/htsjdk#368, but there is still a limitation in htsjdk for reading crams with unmapped reads that are not coordinate sorted that we need to fix/understand.

Availability,"Funcotator will only write alt/ref counts to a MAF inferred from the AD field if the genotype (GT) field is also present in the somatic VCF:. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/febd7cbbd1fc2a631fa9d7dcde52383e3134e88c/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/funcotator/mafOutput/CustomMafFuncotationCreator.java#L74-L76. However, requiring that the GT field be present is unnecessary, since the comma-delimited values of the AD field have no bearing on the contents of the GT field. Indeed, the majority of somatic callers either output `0/1` for every single GT field (e.g. MuTect) or nothing at all (e.g. Strelka), since somatic zygosity (usually called ""multiplicity"") is generally not calculated by a short variant caller, but rather by a downstream tool that computes overall tumor purity/absolute copy number. I came across this bug when trying to convert a Strelka VCF to MAF and noticed that alt/ref counts are not output by Funcotator to the MAF, since Strelka does not write a GT field to its VCFs.

Availability,"GenomicsDB loads now, and I can run the tests. The MIN_DP issue is happening because the BCF codec creates the VariantContext with an Integer value for the attribute since it has the type descriptor at hand, whereas the VCF codec just creates it as a String (it doesn't consult the header, which I might call a bug). The comparator doesn't compare these correctly, and ironically, its the string that gets converted to a double. There also seem to be other problematic type differences between the VCs created from BCF vs. VCF. I need to do think a bit about how to properly fix this; I'm not sure just making the comparator more tolerant of these differences is a good idea, since it could wind up masking real problems.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2389#issuecomment-294962429:630,toler,tolerant,630,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2389#issuecomment-294962429,2,"['mask', 'toler']","['masking', 'tolerant']"

For chr5-12, file size of 1 batch is less than 40GB and they successfully finished import batch 1 and running for batch 2 or 3. Thus, the file size for chr5-12 are 59GB now. However, for chr1-4, they just crash in batch 1 for very long time without any error. I have check the memory usage and there is still >35GB free memory for the compute node of each chromosome.

Availability,George -- thanks much for debugging and identifying the underlying problem. I can confirm that we're able to avoid the error by removing `-XX:+UseSerialGC` and moving back to parallel GC. We'd initially introduced the serial GC usage to avoid problems when running multiple HaplotypeCaller commands simultaneously on a single machine but by letting the Spark implementation take care of parallelizing we should no longer need to worry about that.

Availability,"Goal was to get WGS coverage collection at 100bp at ~15 cents per sample. Since this is I/O bound (takes ~2 hours to stream or localize a BAM, or about the same to decompress a CRAM), cost reduction can be most easily achieved by reducing the memory requirements and moving down to a cheaper VM. . Memory requirements at 100bp are dominated by manipulations of the list of ~30M intervals. There were a few easy fixes to reduce requirements that did not require changing the collection method (which can be easily modified for future investigations, see #4551):. -removed WellformedReadFilter. See #5233. EDIT: We decided after PR review to retain this filter by default and disable it at the WDL level when Best Practices is released. Leaving the issue open.; -initialized HashMultiSet capacity; -removed unnecessary call to OverlapDetector.getAll; -avoided a redundant defensive copy in SimpleCountCollection; -used per-contig OverlapDetectors, rather than a global one. This brought the cost down to ~9 cents per sample using n1-standard-2's with 7.5GB of memory when collecting on BAMs with NIO. Note that I didn't optimize disk size, which accounts for ~50% of the total cost and is unused when running with NIO, so we are closer to ~5 cents per sample. It is possible that using CRAMs with or without NIO and with or without SSDs might be cheaper. Note that OverlapDetectors may be overkill for our case, since bins are guaranteed to be sorted and non-overlapping and queries are also sorted. We could probably roll something that is O(1) in memory. However, since we are I/O bound, as long as we are satisfied with the current cost, I am willing to sacrifice memory for implementation and maintenance costs, as well as the option to change strategies easily. In any case, @lbergelson found some easy wins in OverlapDetector that may further bring the memory usage down, and will issue a fix in htsjdk soon.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5715:274,down,down,274,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5715,5,"['down', 'mainten', 'redundant']","['down', 'maintenance', 'redundant']"

Availability,"Google is deprecating and removing their implementation of the old style GA4GH read and reference API's. . > ; > Reads API functionality is now replaced by the htsget protocol ; > ; > This year, the GA4GH team introduced the htsget protocol to allow users to download read data for subsections of the genome in which they are interested. This is a richer and more flexible approach to working with reads data. It allows you to keep your genomics data in a common BAM file format on Google Cloud Storage and work with it efficiently from your computation pipelines, using standard bioinformatics tools. We have already launched our own open source implementation of this protocol, which you can use to access your reads data. Many popular tools such as samtools and htslib have been updated by the community to support htsget. Documentation is provided here. The Reads API is now deprecated, and will be decommissioned after one year, or after there has been no API activity for one month by those receiving this notice, whichever comes first. ; > ; > Variants API is now replaced by htsget and Variant Transforms ; > ; > The GA4GH team also plans to extend the htsget protocol to cover variant data, and we will extend our implementation of htsget to cover this use case. ; > ; > After analyzing usage of the Variants API, we found that users primarily used it to import variant data and then export it to BigQuery. To save time and effort, we created Variant Transforms, an open source tool for directly importing VCF data into BigQuery. Variant Transforms and its documentation are published here. Variant Transforms is more scalable than the legacy Variants API, and it has a robust roadmap with a dedicated team. We also welcome collaborators on this project as it advances. ; > ; > The Variants API is now deprecated, and will be decommissioned after one year, or after there has been no API activity for one month, whichever comes first. ; > ; > We are excited to move in step with the global ge",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4166:259,down,download,259,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4166,1,['down'],['download']

Availability,"Hello - we're trying to run Funcotator with a custom data source, where that source is a locatableXsv (i.e. simple tab-delimited file with columns for contig, start, and end). I believe I understand how to make this TSV and the config file. The issue is that I dont see a way to create the index (i.e. tsv.idx), and GATK fails when I try to run against a data source without the index. Not that surprisingly, IndexFeatureFile errors when trying to index a TSV saying ""no suitable codecs found"". Is there another tool that's able to make indexes on simple TSVs?. FWIW, the only example LocatableXsv source I could find in the default data sources is Oreganno. The majority of TSV-based sources are simpleXSV and just map using Gene symbol (so apparently no index is required). When I try to index the existing oreganno.tsv file, I get the same problem.

Availability,"Hello @AlirezaTafazzoli looking at your error and the the stderr output it looks like what happened is that the bed file you used of your genes was generated on a different reference. If you have a standard GRC37 reference the chr1 name should be valid. Could you check the .ditct files for the reference you have to make sure the names align with the ones in the genes.bed file you are using? I would also check to be 100% sure that your bam file also has the same contigs in its sequence dictionary. Furthermore it would be helpful to diagnose this issue if you could rerun with a stacktrace on ""GATK_STACKTRACE_ON_USR_EXCEPTION"" in the java options in the output you posted. I would also recommend using samtools to regenerate the .dict files for your reference and trying again if you are sure the genes.bed file is matched correctly. . As a minor sidenote, if you want per-gene coverage information out of DepthOfCoverage i would recommend checking out hte --gene-list argument and files. Those will allow you to get coverage across different transcripts and including the ability to distinguish between intros and exons in coverage calculation.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7453#issuecomment-970386510:40,error,error,40,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7453#issuecomment-970386510,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,Hello @bbimber thank you for the response. I would recommend using the read filters (in your case `-rf MappingQualityReadFilter --minimum-mapping-quality ##` to achieve the same functionality as the `-mmq` argument from GATK3. When porting over the tool we tried to push as much functionality from obscure arguments into the existing filtering framework as possible and `-mmq` was one of the ones that was redundant as it was a simple filter placed on the reads before counting them which the existing filtering code was able to handle. I will add some lines to the documentation clarifying this for users in the future.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6617#issuecomment-634752928:406,redundant,redundant,406,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6617#issuecomment-634752928,2,['redundant'],['redundant']
Availability,"Hello @bharathramh thank you for your question. We just recently merged the bulk of the code for DRAGEN-GATK (#6634) which means that we are slated to release the DRAGEN-GATK for the next release of GATK. When that happens we will also be releasing an official wdl workflow to use all the new features together. . As for STR variants, one of the code improvements in the new genotyping engine is to better model STR errors by performing a per-sample pre-processing step where a table of empirically generated STR priors is generated by the tools `ComposeSTRTableFile` and `CallibrateDragstrModel`. These work by modifying the priors for genotying to be more in line with the sample PCR/Sequencing errors and can't really be thought of as a feature to ""find STRs"" (except `ComposeSTRTableFile` which is used to find STRs in the reference). These will be featured in the published wdls with appropriate commands. .

Availability,Hello @lindenb. . I think I found what is going on here and its a bug on our part that we didn't provide a better error for this issue. In the bed file you uploaded this is the offending interval:; `GL000223.1 178912 180554`; Unfortunately this is the length of that interval in the hg37 decoy sequence dictionary is as follows:; `@SQ SN:GL000223.1 LN:180455`; So it seems the issue here is that something got mangled and you are requesting a bad interval. It turns out we were using a codepath that failed to check that the interval was valid when specified as a bed file and active region padding code was using the correct interval based on the dictionary. This should be an easy fix on your end. I am making a branch that should trigger a better check and error message.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7289#issuecomment-856162960:114,error,error,114,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7289#issuecomment-856162960,2,['error'],['error']
Availability,"Hello @liuyihhha, I'm sorry to hear that. We should probably include a more prominent warning that something like this could happen if you disable all of the readfilters for the tool some of them are there just to make sure everything is formatted correctly and doesn't crash. If you `--disable-tool-default-read-filters` it disables all of them including the basic ""can the GATK even parse this read"" style readfilters. I would recommend adding back in some of the more basic read filters and seeing if you still get this error. Specifically I would recommend trying with the following arguments:; ```; --disable-tool-default-read-filters true; -RF WellformedReadFilter; -RF GoodCigarReadFilter; ```; As for what about SplitNCigarReads could be causing the reads to be invalid I would like to have some idea of what the issue is. You could try running `ValidateSamFile` on your input to Mutect2 and hopefully that will spit back some readnames that are invalid which should make it easier to diagnose.

The only quirk we have noticed is the incorrect INFO/DP values, where select variants would encode values on per-sample basis while bcftools would copy over the INFO/DP from the bigger vcf file. That being said, the FORMAT/DP is encoded with the correct per-sample value, so it doesn't affect our downstream analysis. . To further speed up the extraction, we have used bcf file format instead of vcf. With uncompressed bcf, the 80 GB vcf file goes down to ~9 GB. Here's how much we have sped up extraction times - . 1. ```SelectVariants``` from GATK on vcf file of 100 GB - ~50 minutes; 2. ```bcftools``` on vcf file of 100 GB - ~15 minutes; 3. ```bcftools``` on ```bcf``` file of 10 GB - ~5 minutes.

Availability,"Hello, sorry you're having this problem. I'm not sure exactly what's going on here. It sounds like it's a corrupted .gz file. You said these were created by HaplotypeCaller and then CombineGvcfs? I have a few questions and suggestions. 1. Were there any other steps in the pipeline that touch the vcfs?; 2. Are you sure the combine stage completed without error? This could potentially be caused by a failure in the step beforehand that silently truncates a file.; 2. Did you run all steps of the pipeline with --use-jdk-deflater & --use-jdk-inflate or just the final one that crashes?; 3. Can you try running PrintBGZFBlockInformation on the file and see what the output of that says?; 4. Is it reproducible on a small file you could share with us?; 5. It might be worth trying with the newest version of GATK because we upgraded to a new version of the intel deflater in 4.2.1.0 which fixed a lot of issues possibly including this one.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7614#issuecomment-1004305052:356,error,error,356,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7614#issuecomment-1004305052,2,"['error', 'failure']","['error', 'failure']"

Availability,"Hello,. GenomicsDB developer here - I'm not super familiar with SLURM...can you tell if your job was actually terminated or was that just a warning of sorts? Can you use `saact` command to find the memory usage of the job? Do your logs tell you how many batches have made progress before you see the error above?. Also, is this difference intentional or...?; > #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=**100G**; vs; > --java-options ""-Xmx190g -**Xms190g**"". Lastly, you could try reducing the batch size down (let's say something like 10, just to see if it makes the error go away) or splitting up into smaller intervals than chromosomes (say, split into intervals of size 50 million) and see if that makes a difference. The idea with each of these is to lower memory usage. Edit: One more thing @nalinigans reminded me of - you could potentially be allocating too much for java here. Again, not super familiar with SLURM so not sure how much this job is getting overall vs how much is being given to Java. GenomicsDB has a core C++ component that does a lot of heavy lifting for us. If you've allocated all/most of the memory available to the job to Java, then the C++ side might be getting starved or causing the job to go over limits. Try reducing what you've set for `--java-options` to make sure there is some memory left for the C++ parts.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6321#issuecomment-566194913:300,error,error,300,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6321#issuecomment-566194913,4,"['avail', 'down', 'error']","['available', 'down', 'error']"

Availability,"Hello,. I'm trying to use the CNVGermline Pipeline with Nextflow and a GATK Singularity image pulled from your Docker image. . As you can see, I'm trying to run the DetermineGermlineContigPloidy with 57 samples, and I got a permission error within my Singularity container. This error is directly related to Singularity permissions to create a directory ('/root/.theano/compiledir_Linux-4.10--generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid-x86_64-3.6.2-64'), because it's running fine with Singularity when I'm root and Docker (without root). So it's not really a GATK4 problem but more a singularity-GATK4 related problem. Maybe your GATK4 Germline CNV calling pipeline is not designed to work as a Singularity container (which is quite understandable), because for tools like HaplotypeCaller, MarkDuplicates ... It's working fine. I didn't know where to post this error, singularity or GATK github, so why not both ! . Do you have any idea make it run properly ?

Availability,"Hello,. I'm using the GATK4 docker image to evaluate the efficiency of my targeted experiment. After googling around, I realize that CollectHsMetrics is the tool to use from now on (correct me if i'm wrong). The old DepthOfCoverage, CalculateTargetCoverage, CalculateHsMetrics are not available anymore, so I'm trying to implement this utility in our pipeline. Given the fact I'm providing the same file as the BAITS_INTERVALS and TARGETS_INTERVALS, I'd expect the PCT_OFF_BAIT and PCT_EXC_OFF_TARGET to be the same, but then I [read here](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/7442/collecthsmetrics) that the ON_BAIT_BASES and ON_TARGET_BASES may actually differ due to the fact one relies on the NEAR_DISTANCE argument (that only applies on the ON_BAIT_BASES) and other depends on some read filters (MINIMUM_BASE_QUALITY and MINIMUM_MAPPING_QUALITY that may apply to ON_TARGET_BASES, didn't find any documention on that). Indeed, I observed the described differences in the ON_BAIT_BASES/ON_TARGET_BASES metrics:. > ON_BAIT_BASES 1733719583; ON_TARGET_BASES 1274990601. which was reflected in the PCT_SELECTED_BASES (Fraction of bases from reads passing the filters located on or near a baited region):; > PCT_SELECTED_BASES 0.690911. Then, for the PCT_EXC_OFF_TARGET (Fraction of aligned bases that were filtered out because they did not align over a target base.) I got:; >PCT_EXC_OFF_TARGET 0.731878. which doesn't make sense to be so high. Shouldn't this value be close to the result of (`1-PCT_SELECTED_BASES`) , given that the BAITS and TARGETS intervals file is the same ?.

Availability,"Hello. I am Adam Yongxin Ye, a PhD candidate in Peking University, supervised by Prof Liping Wei. We have developed MosaicHunter, a bioinformatic tool that can identify postzygotic single-nucleotide mosaicisms (with allele fraction deviated from homozygous 0, 1 and heterozygous 0.5) in bulk sequencing data of a single sample without matched control. After I had the recent lectures on GATK4 tutorial in Beijing, I thought it might be great to merge MosaicHunter into GATK framework, especially for the local assembly function in HaplotypeCaller and Mutect2, to increase the sensitivity & specificity and even extend for mosaic indels, as well as to make MosaicHunter easy for more users to use. MosaicHunter utilized GATK preprocessing, distinguished mosaicisms from germline homozygous and heterozygous sites by a Bayesian genotyper, and applied several stringent hard filters. MosaicHunter has been published (https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/10/e76/2962179 and http://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014131) and is publicly available (http://mosaichunter.cbi.pku.edu.cn/ and https://github.com/zzhang526/MosaicHunter (with source code in java)).

Availability,"Hello.; I believe there is an error in the description of the algorithm in the pairHMM alignment stage. It states that it does **local** alignment, however the code implements a **global** alignment.; Therefore I fixed the comments and added the correct reference to Durbin's book. (The figure referenced is not the Finite State Machine implemented). This was discussed on the GATK forum before I made the pull request.; See discussion here : [Discussion Thread](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/23197/question-about-the-alignment-performed-in-the-haplotypecaller-pairhmm#latest). I believe this is important, because the difference between the two FSMs is as important as the difference between running the Needleman–Wunsch and Smith-Waterman algorithm (global vs local).

Availability,"Heng's paper _""A statistical framework for SNP calling. . .""_ presents two methods for calculating a variant QUAL score. The first and simpler approach finds a maximum likelihood allele fraction. The second, which is implemented in the GATK, enumerates the likelihoods of all possible partitions of allele counts among the total ploidy of all samples. The latter approach becomes nightmarish (in terms of speed and code complexity) for non-diploid organisms _or_ multiple alt alleles and scales poorly (quadratically, I believe) with the number of samples. Known bugs in the calculation -- and the difficulty of repairing them -- can be attributed to its complexity. And its treatment of multiple alt alleles involves a major hack. The task is to generalize the allele fraction (as opposed to allele count) equations to non-diploid samples with multiple alt alleles, figure out appropriate priors, and implement it as a new QUAL score calculator.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1697:612,repair,repairing,612,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1697,1,['repair'],['repairing']
