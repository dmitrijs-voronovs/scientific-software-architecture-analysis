Testability,God that method is so much worse than i thought... We resort to hard coding common side outputs that are likely to show up and mark them for deletion in case we happen to produce one of them... I wonder if it is indeed possible to flag a directory for deletion and if we cant improve that method by secretly putting the file you ask for into a delete-on-exit folder so we don't have to guess about indexes and side outputs (that frankly don't look complete? What if my test has a tmp-fast dict/index those aren't included in the list of side outputs to flag for deletion).,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6780#issuecomment-684934864:469,test,test,469,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6780#issuecomment-684934864,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Hello,. GenomicsDB developer here - I'm not super familiar with SLURM...can you tell if your job was actually terminated or was that just a warning of sorts? Can you use `saact` command to find the memory usage of the job? Do your logs tell you how many batches have made progress before you see the error above?. Also, is this difference intentional or...?; > #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=**100G**; vs; > --java-options ""-Xmx190g -**Xms190g**"". Lastly, you could try reducing the batch size down (let's say something like 10, just to see if it makes the error go away) or splitting up into smaller intervals than chromosomes (say, split into intervals of size 50 million) and see if that makes a difference. The idea with each of these is to lower memory usage. Edit: One more thing @nalinigans reminded me of - you could potentially be allocating too much for java here. Again, not super familiar with SLURM so not sure how much this job is getting overall vs how much is being given to Java. GenomicsDB has a core C++ component that does a lot of heavy lifting for us. If you've allocated all/most of the memory available to the job to Java, then the C++ side might be getting starved or causing the job to go over limits. Try reducing what you've set for `--java-options` to make sure there is some memory left for the C++ parts.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6321#issuecomment-566194913:231,log,logs,231,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6321#issuecomment-566194913,1,['log'],['logs']

Testability,"Here's a prototype showing one way of doing this: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/3cf7f9078b6aedcb87a4ca77c2aa8e84e7e5fe99. The idea is that `GATKTool` has a `-spark` flag, so you can run a tool in Spark mode. The parallel `GATKSparkTool` hierarchy would disappear, and tool writers would optionally be able to support Spark as an alternative to the regular walker, by providing the relevant code in the same tool class. As an example, the `FlagStat` implementation looks like this:. ``` java; @Override; public void traverse() {; if (sparkArgs.useSpark) {; sum = getReadsRdd().aggregate(new FlagStatus(), FlagStatus::add, FlagStatus::merge);; } else {; sum = getReadsStream().collect(FlagStatus::new, FlagStatus::add, FlagStatus::merge);; }; }; ```. Note that the walker version uses the Java 8 Streams API, while the Spark version uses the RDD API. While these are different APIs, many of the concepts are similar, so it should be possible to share the underlying logic by encapsulating it in classes, in much the same way as is done by the `FlagStatus` class for `FlagStat`. It would also be possible to keep the existing `apply` method for walker versions of tools that simply iterate over each record.

Testability,"Hey @davidbenjamin,. just a heads-up that we have generated some additional inights on this issue that relate to the effects of sample prep on false-positive rates under the changed error model. In short, it seems as if the error model is now much more (perhaps overly?) sensitive to sample-prep noise typical in real-world clinical sequencing data, leading to a 2-3x increase of false-positives in such WES (and, assuming, also other high-coverage) samples. This may have been an undesired side effect of overfitting the error model to the synthetic (and thus much cleaner) DREAM3 benchmark two years ago.

This has the benefit of not requiring client code to put `throws IOException` (or catch the `IOException`) everywhere, and is more consistent with the rest of the codebase, which typically traps checked exceptions as early as possible and wraps them in unchecked exceptions (either `UserException` or `GATKException`, depending on whether it's likely to be the user's fault or not).

Testability,"Hi @LiviaMoura ,. The dropped allele is expected behavior. One of the ways reblocking speeds up joint genotyping is by dropping information associated with alleles that are not in the most likely genotype. The subsequent alleles are not left aligned because the position doesn't change. Instead they are trimmed so that they use the minimal representation. Historically the FORMAT DP doesn't change when alleles are dropped (as in subsetting more than 5 alternate alleles in the previous pipeline). Given that this is a GVCF with a <NON_REF> allele, the most correct thing to do would be to move that 1 read associated with the dropped allele to the <NON_REF> AD so that the sum of the AD values are still equal to the FORMAT DP, but the NON-REF AD values will get dropped in the joint genotyping step anyway, so the change would only be reflected in the intermediate GVCF files. The DRAGEN data I had been working with didn't have allele fraction, but we also came across this issue independently. I made a fix and we're testing it now. If it looks good, I'll generalize it to use the header information rather than special casing particular annotations. I can put in some code to subset the posteriors as well.

Testability,"Hi @Neato-Nick @davidbenjamin . Apologies for posting this message here. I have posted this message few days before at the regular GATK forum and also using the direct inbox option but have got no response so maybe something wrong with my account. The issue is - I have done variant calling on 384 potato samples following, mostly, GATK best ##practices and have applied hard filters to select SNPs for further usage. However, I am noticing that '--max-nocall-fraction', '--max-nocall-number' and '--max-fraction-filtered-genotypes' arguments for 'SelectVariants' are not working properly. I have tried with various cutoff settings and every time I am observing SNPs with a much larger number of genotypes (~246 out of 384 with 0.10 setting) with 'no call' than the set thresholds. I have searched the forum first but couldn't find any relevant threads. I am using the latest GATK version (4.0.7.0). I am attaching three example sets of (1) log files (2) subset vcf files and (3) vcf index file for the three main vcfs.

Testability,Hi @RWilton i'm sorry to hear that. I suspect its unrelated given how simple this PR is but its quite possible that filter has been broken since evidently nobody was able to use and adjust it for a long time. This is the logic here that the filter uses:; `return read.isPaired() && !read.isUnmapped() && !read.mateIsUnmapped() &&; (Math.abs(read.getStart() - read.getMateStart()) >= mateTooDistantLength || !read.getContig().equals(read.getMateContig()));`. That logic is correct for what the filter is doing. It should be noted that the filter does the opposite of what you expect it to (since its intended for our SV pipeline) in that it filters out all reads that are NOT having distant mates. This means if you try to run HaplotypeCaller with this setting you will be throwing away every read pair EXCEPT the distant ones which results in mostly no reads. We should perhaps rename this filter to be a little less confusing.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7701#issuecomment-1103010098:221,log,logic,221,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7701#issuecomment-1103010098,4,['log'],['logic']

Testability,"Hi @cmnbroad, we can do better than crash - you'll notice that in my pull request, I've added a check to `CNNScoreVariants.java` to test whether AVX is present (the method was checking if command-line arguments are valid, so I stretched a point and used it to test the environment). . ~.

Testability,"Hi @cwhelan , I've expanded this PR to do more than what it originally was trying to fix, and separated the patches by commits as usual:. * the originally proposed fix, which brings back the annotation that are available to simple variants but go missing due to a careless bug, is now done in commit 50f1b640a31ddb528dc763b83b26a9d98dce8556; this commit also accordingly refactors the giant class `CpxVariantDetector` into three new classes; * in the 2nd commit 734516383fb665a79796de76535560fc03cb754b, I did more refactoring on how we group the descriptions for the annotation keys, and updated the test VCF files accordingly.; * because of the refactoring, the review comments were gone, so I added them back in the 3rd commit b7619c45a949dfba21d65a5ed876bc72e832aa77, which contains the comments and my replies. They come in as TODO's but are going to be removed ultimately; * in the following commits, I added tests for the CPX code path, selecting three representative cases (there's no limit how complex the scenario can go).

Testability,"Hi @cwhelan, In my testing, the issue doesn't seem to be sensitive to the choice of BAM (e.g. same crash occurs with a BAM that doesn't have any read coverage at this locus). If you haven't been able to reproduce the issue, I'm wondering if the critical factor may be some aspect of the particular genotypes in the `--alleles` VCF (e.g. I noticed one sample was `0|1` in one of the two records and `1|0` in the other). In any case, I've attached a BAM and alleles VCF that should enable you to reproduce the issue.

Testability,Hi @danieljrichard. I suspect the error message you're seeing is a not the underlying problem. Sometimes when the tool crashes there are errors during standard shutdown cleanup that hide the real problem. There's a [recent patch](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/f7dea3c08b126c56b851c4d381cfdb5513e0584f) which makes it so that should happen much less but it's not in any currently released version. Are you able to build the current master branch of gatk and repeat your test with that version? I suspect it will clarify what's going on.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8232#issuecomment-1452177739:485,test,test,485,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8232#issuecomment-1452177739,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Hi @davidbenjamin ,. this ticket is already open for a while, but I haven't found a sensible multi-sample wdl yet, so I've spent some time putting a multi-sample calling workflow together and tested it extensively: https://github.com/phylyc/gatk4-somatic-snvs-indels. It's somewhat optimized for resource needs, at least much more so than the published gatk mutect2 wdl.; One option that I added is to run the realignment filter only on a subset of called variants, which is especially helpful for tumor-only calling to reduce costs if we are hard filtering variants afterwards based on some thresholds anyways (who doesn't?). One todo is still to choose the best normal sample for the contamination model based on which has the highest sequencing depth, as you had mentioned in some old gatk forum post. Happy to have some contributions there :); I also brushed up the PoN wdl, which is also tested. How important is cram input support?

Testability,"Hi @jean-philippe-martin ,. A `Feature` in our codebase has a specific meaning that is different from ""interval"": it is a record that 1. has a location on the genome plus (typically) some metadata information about that location and 2. is in one of the formats supported by our file-parsing framework tribble and is the product of a tribble codec. A VCF record is an example of a `Feature`. . The common interface between `Feature` and `SimpleInterval` is called `Locatable`. I recommend (for now) that you simply alter your uprooted version of BQSR to take a `List<? extends Locatable>` instead of a `List<? extends Feature>` in `apply()`. This should require no code changes beyond changing method parameter types, and it will allow you to feed BQSR `SimpleIntervals` for the known sites for now, and `Features` like VCF records later on when we're ready for that.

Testability,Hi @lucifer9288. Thanks for pointing this out as its a very confusing message. Its an oversight in our logging that causes that error message and it should not mean that your execution of SplitNCigarReads was invalid. The inflater in this message is referring to the fact that one of the compressed blocks gets uncompressed with zero output bytes which happens with the very last block of a properly formatted BGZF file (as a your input bam should be). It looks like the issue is an errant message in the GKL intel inflater.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8126#issuecomment-1371196080:103,log,logging,103,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8126#issuecomment-1371196080,1,['log'],['logging']

Testability,"Hi @magicDGS. I went down this same path (composition of CountingFilter) when I originally implemented CountingReadFilter, but I abandoned it for the model we currently have. I think the current model is much simpler in a number of ways. This is an interesting problem, but I would say lets just implement a straight CountingVariantFilter/tests and not try to do the common implementation. . BTW, when looking at this PR I noticed two bugs in the existing code that we should make sure not to propagate to the Variant one (feel free to fix/test these as part of this PR):. - CountingReadFilter.resetFilterCount only resets the root filter count; it needs an override in BinOp to propagate the reset call to the lhs/rhs operands.; - there is a bug in the getSummary tests/code; you can see the fix [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/9ef1458271834aed9b64a5d66f94df33f025eafb).

Great that you were able to successfully run GermlineCNVCaller! @asmirnov239 is currently working on a postprocessing tool that will convert the raw generated results into VCFs. @mbabadi is also working on writing some more in-depth documentation on the tool and its probabilistic model. For now, you may be able to parse the raw results on your own. You are probably most interested in the contents of the ""*-calls"" directory. The root of this directory contains the interval list common to all samples; furthermore, each sample has its own subdirectory that contains text files that describe the sample-specific model-parameter posteriors. In particular, the ""log_q_c_tc.tsv"" file contains the log posteriors per copy-number state, with rows corresponding to the intervals in the aforementioned interval list.

Testability,"Hi @tomwhite! The serializer registrations in ADAM shouldn't effect any GATK serialization, unless you're serializing classes from ADAM (such as `org.bdgenomics.format.avro.AlignmentRecord`); additionally, we haven't seen any performance issues with serialization in ADAM 0.23.0 outside of the GATK. We actually made a number of patches to eliminate logging in 0.23.0 (relative to 0.22.0), so I'd doubt that is the culprit. The one exception to this is logging when writing Parquet out to disk, which greatly increased sometime between ADAM 0.21.0 and 0.23.0, due to a change in Parquet versions upstream in Spark. However, this would only impact you if you were writing Parquet, and additionally this issue was resolved with the release of Spark 2.2.0, so you should see the logging go away with #4314. If I had to hypothesize anything, I'd suggest that the 2bit file change is the one thing that could be biting you. That said, we've been running with this 2bit file code quite frequently on AWS and Azure for at least the last 6 months using GATK HC on WES and WGS data and haven't seen any performance issues. I show that the changes in the 2bit file code between ADAM 0.20.0 and 0.23.0 are API compatible, so if you check out ADAM 0.23.0 and then `git checkout adam-parent-spark2_2.11-0.20.0 adam-core/src/main/scala/org/bdgenomics/adam/util/TwoBitFile.scala` and build the ADAM JAR (and then package that jar into GATK), you should be able to test that hypothesis.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4376#issuecomment-366308897:350,log,logging,350,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4376#issuecomment-366308897,4,"['log', 'test']","['logging', 'test']"
Testability,"Hi @tomwhite; thanks for pinging this upstream on https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam/issues/1093.

Naturally, we'd prefer to not have to provide a custom TF distribution for a fallback, but there are 3 cases where we may not have a choice: user with old hardware, Travis/CI testing, and GCE. We may need to provide a fallback environment for those (I'll try to get resolution on that). If it turns out we do, I'm actually not suggesting the fallback be automatic (3 in your list), just that we have a graceful failure mode and an instructive error message. . In the meantime, there is still the issue that this PR fails to even build on Travis. It looks like it produces so much output building the Docker image that it exceeds the allowable Travis build log size.

Testability,"Hi [cademirch](https://github.com/cademirch),. I believe the tool is working as intended in this case. The tool in this mode is designed to balance interval lists evenly by the amount of genomic territory covered, without splitting any individual interval. The documentation for `BALANCING_WITHOUT_INTERVAL_SUBDIVISION` mode mentions this:. ""Scatter the interval list into similarly sized interval lists (**_by base count_**), but without breaking up intervals."". Since the tool is not allowed to split individual intervals in this mode, it may use the number of bases in the largest interval (`test:160-220` in your toy example) as the target number of bases per file:. ""The ""target width"" of each scatter list may be wider than what is computed for INTERVAL_SUBDIVISION.

Testability,"Hi again, some updates! I've updated our PED with inferred rather than stated sex, which has resolved a number of these issues. As stated before, the samples which had incorrectly assigned sexes were not the named samples appearing the error logs, which made troubleshooting a challenge. . We're now running into issues with true sex aneuploidy, which the tool doesn't work for, as stated in [your docs page](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/9570468120987-JointGermlineCNVSegmentation-BETA). Do you have a way to cleanly handle these sex aneuploidies so that we can retain calls for the rest of the genome, rather than excluding the sample(s) entirely? This might be a process question, so I'm going to raise separately on the GATK-SV repo.

Testability,Hi all -- I have recently started observing this exact issue with PrintReads. I have been using this via cromwell jobs in Terra and on Saturday this issue cropped up. I was able to recreate it locally by launching the latest GATK Docker image (4.2.5.0) and running `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud auth application-default login`. Similar to @ldgauthier adding `export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=` does nothing locally. Did this ever get resolved? Let me know if I'm missing something here.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6179#issuecomment-1046993824:278,log,login,278,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6179#issuecomment-1046993824,2,['log'],['login']
Testability,"Hi all, thanks again for working to integrate this code!. Saw some confusion in the comments above and just wanted to clarify: if you take a look at the VQSR-lite PR https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7954/commits that the current branch is rebased upon, you'll see that it contains a version of the Joint Genotyping WDL (which was put together by Megan for Ultima) along with Java code for the tools (which was written by me). Both the WDL and the code have been updated in subsequent PRs. The WDL was rewritten by me in #8074; the main difference is that we no longer run SNPs and indels filtering in ""series"", but instead run them in a single step. However, this requires that you use the same annotations for both SNPs and indels; GVS might not be ready for that just yet, since the default WARP implementation uses different annotations. (But see also the comment here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8074#issue-1423991277. The gist is we can easily reimplement Megan's/WARP's ""serial"" SNP-then-indel workflow using the simpler single-step workflow.) (EDIT: I was originally confused here, Megan’s WDL simply runs SNPs and indels separately—thanks to George for correcting me here!). Note also that test infrastructure was moved from Travis to Github Actions between these PRs, so the Travis references above have already been cleaned up. There have also been a few additional minor PRs merged in the interim, with a couple more incoming. These PRs do not fundamentally change the interfaces of the tools/WDL, however, so I think you can update to them when you're ready. Punchline: this branch should suffice for a first cut of a VQSR/VQSR-lite bakeoff, and although it is already slightly out of date, it shouldn't be too much work to get things updated after the first cut is done.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8157#issuecomment-1412640649:1226,test,test,1226,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8157#issuecomment-1412640649,2,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Hi, regarding making --linked-de-bruijn-graph the default, I wanted to share that I had recently run mutect2 (gatkv4.2.6.1) on a larger cohort of samples with that option, some of which had variant calls from a previous mutect2 run (gatkv4.1.0.0) without this option. I noticed that plenty of known cancer drivers (e.g. KRAS p.G12C or PIK3CA p.E545* or BRAF p.V600*) that were present in a substantial number of samples (>10%ish) in the old calls were completely absent in the new calls. I had to add the option --recover-all-dangling-branches to recover those known hotspot mutations. They also all have very sufficient coverage (O(100)x) and high VAF to make them obvious true positives. I'd expect from mutect2 to be always able to call presence or absence of known hotspot mutations, so you should either look into further testing/debugging the linked de Bruijn graph option or also make it a default to recover all dangling branches.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7809#issuecomment-1125355262:827,test,testing,827,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7809#issuecomment-1125355262,1,['test'],['testing']

Testability,"Hmm, thanks for suggesting the addition of a regression test @fleharty. This caused me to realize that I actually missed another gap in the previous filtering logic that might have yielded NaNs (resulting from division by zero interval medians) in this particular edge case, which actually takes effect before the rounding error I originally fixed. However, because of how HDF5 writes NaN values as 0, this apparently doesn't lead to any catastrophic failures. We should definitely check that behavior is reasonable in this case (i.e., when interval medians are zero); I've filed #6878. In the end, I added a regression test that only passes with the changes to address the rounding error. This was a bit of a pain because we use simulated data in the tests that cover this code, and the filters are applied in sequential order only on those elements that passed the previous filter. Note that there are many other possible filtering combinations that would be impractical to test. I think that all of this filtering logic was ported over from GATK CNV (I only rewrote the code to perform the filtering in-place to improve memory usage), and I'm not sure that all edge-case behavior was well defined by the original logic (which probably implicitly assumed typical, well formed data, i.e., using more than one sample, without too many uncovered intervals). Fortunately, these edge-case usages (i.e., using a single sample to build the PoN, mistakenly including too many uncovered intervals, and/or disabling various filters) are probably not too common.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6624#issuecomment-705843882:56,test,test,56,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6624#issuecomment-705843882,7,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'test', 'tests']"

I agree that the abstract class should discourage not honoring the user order.; * Access to methods/fields: I think that the plugin could be used outside GATK in a different way by extending it. I explained some of my usage cases in one of the comments in the code, but just by overriding a simple method the whole plugin could be used very nicely in some of them.

I would expect a more CPU-intensive (or a more heavily loaded machine) would reduce the impact of the buffer size as I/O ceases to be the bottleneck. I also ran experiments on a 1-cpu machine with VCF and loading a single interval, which I think matches what you are asking about.

Testability,"I created a panel of normals from 90 WGS TCGA samples with 250bp (~11.5M) bins, which took **~57 minutes** total and produced an **11GB PoN** (this file includes all of the input read counts---which take up 20GB as a combined TSV file and a whopping 63GB as individual TSV files---as well as the eigenvectors, filtering results, etc.). The run can be found in /dsde/working/slee/wgs-pon-test/tieout/no-gc. It completed successfully with **-Xmx32G** (in comparison, CreatePanelOfNormals crashed after 40 minutes with -Xmx128G). The runtime breakdown was as follows:. - ~45 minutes simply from reading of the 90 TSV read-count files in serial. Hopefully #3349 should greatly speed this up. (In comparison, CombineReadCounts reading 10 files in parallel at a time took ~100 minutes to create the aforementioned 20GB combined TSV file, creating 25+GB of temp files along the way.). - ~5 minutes from the preprocessing and filtering steps. We could probably further optimize some of this code in terms of speed and heap usage. (I had to throw in a call to System.gc() to avoid an OOM with -Xmx32G, which I encountered in my first attempt at the run...). - ~5 minutes from performing the SVD of the post-filtering 8643028 x 86 matrix, maintaining 30 eigensamples. I could write a quick implementation of randomized SVD, which I think could bring this down a bit (the scikit-learn implementation takes <2 minutes on a 10M x 100 matrix), but this can probably wait. Clearly making I/O faster and more space efficient is the highest priority. Luckily it's also low hanging fruit. The 8643028 x 30 matrix of eigenvectors takes <2 minutes to read from HDF5 when the WGS PoN is used in DenoiseReadCounts, which gives us a rough idea of how long it should take to read in the original ~11.5M x 90 counts from HDF5.

Testability,"I definitely like the idea of moving in this direction, and it will become more compelling as we extend the GATKSparkTool hierarchy, which is currently pretty flat and doesn't mirror the GATKTool hierarchy. I think we should also consider using some of the concepts from the metrics refactoring, which introduces a layer that separates the implementation of the processing logic from the containing tool/driver, and allows a single implementation (i.e. metrics collector, but could be FlagStats, CountReads, SelectVariants, whatever) to be independent of the source and/or destination of the data.

Testability,"I did a simple experiment and changed the version of Java used in the non-Docker (""17"", although again I'm not sure what this actually resolves to) to that used in the Docker (17.0.1+12). This causes both non-Docker and Docker tests to now fail, rather than just the Docker tests; see https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8174#issuecomment-1402974502. Moreover, the test failures produce exactly the same discrepant numerical results. I think we can probably conclude that the expected test results were generated with ""17"" and that changing to 17.0.1+12 generates different results. This is not too unreasonable; see the Slack thread linked in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8111#issuecomment-1331407680, for example, which shows that we might be getting into pretty hairy territory and that even changes to things like how HotSpot Intrinsics are implemented in each JVM can cause the numerical differences we see here. So perhaps we can either 1) change the Docker version to the version corresponding to ""17"" or 2) change the non-Docker version to 17.0.1+12 and update the expected results?.

So I'm not sure what the purpose of having ""ALL"" is in the first place, if the only thing you can usefully do with it is exclude it. I think the best longer term fix would be to add an ""--validation-type-to-include"" arg, and have it default to the everything except for IDs, and then construct the actual types based on merging include/exclude args. But thats a bigger change then just fixing the current (silent do-nothing) default behavior, and requires more error checking for conflicting args. Lets start with changing it so that in the default (no args) case, we log a warning message saying that IDs will be left out since no IDS were provided, and proceed with the remaining validations. Then if we want to get more ambitious we can talk about making the bigger change. Also, as part of the initial fix, it might be a good idea to change `calculateValidationTypesToApply` so that it doesn't modify the `excludeTypes` list directly, since this is the list provided by the user, and instead uses it's own temporary list.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5862#issuecomment-498685279:665,log,log,665,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5862#issuecomment-498685279,1,['log'],['log']

Testability,"I had a look at the source code of [HypergeometricDistribution](HypergeometricDistribution). If I am right, we are doing the following. We are invoking `logProbability()` for all possible `x[0][0]`. For a table with large numbers, we have to compute logBinomial for many iterations (see line 202–222 in the HypergeometricDistribution source code). Typically logBinomial calls three logGamma and each logGamma calls `log()` twice. This involves lots of computation and is not the fastest way to implement Fisher's exact test. A faster way to implement the test takes the advantage of two observations. 1) When carrying the test, we are calling hypergeo(i,m+n,m,k), hypergeo(i+1,m+n,m,k), ... in order, and we can derive hypergeo(i+1,m+n,m,k) from hypergeo(i,m+n,m,k) by simply multiplying a number. This will be much faster than doing the full hypergeo->logBionomial->logGamma->log computation for each `i`. 2) For a large table, often when `i` is sufficiently smaller or larger than `x[0][0]`, the hypergeo probability is small enough to be ignored from the sum. It is not necessary to calculate hypergeo for the full range of `lo<=i<hi`. This trick can also dramatically reduce the number of iterations for large tables. htslib has a [exact test implementation](https://github.com/samtools/htslib/blob/bf753361dab9b1640cf64f7886dbfe35357a43c5/kfunc.c#L201) that considers the two observations. I understand that the time spent on the `FisherExactTest` class probably won't show up at all in a profiler. I am not requesting to improve the implementation now. Just let you know the tricks.

Testability,"I have a good feeling about numerical instability from this point forward because:. * My terminology was lazy. It's not really ""numerical instability,"" which is a deep and frightening topic, but rather just plain old finite precision, which is not nearly so hydra-headed a problem.; * I learned the general rule for avoiding finite precision problems with a qual score, which is: always calculate probabilities of alleles being absent. Previously I was calculating the probability that samples had an allele and subtracting (in log space) that from 1. The problem with that is that for very good GQs this probability is so closed to 1 that quals can become infinite. In this PR we add up the probabilities of genotypes that don't have the allele, which is small but non-zero and everything works fine.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4614#issuecomment-434769078:528,log,log,528,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4614#issuecomment-434769078,2,['log'],['log']

Testability,"I have the same problem. The error seems to occur when the number of alleles is exactly one greater than the value of ` --max-alternate-alleles`. Note that is the case in Andrius's output above: it throws a warning, but no error, when there are more than 7 alleles, but when there are exactly 7 alleles (one more than the default max of 6) it errors out. . I have tried this on a number of different chromosomes (small test cases with 4 Chinook salmon) and always get the error immediately after a warning about having 7 alleles. On one chromosome, an earlier warning about 8 alleles causes no error, UNLESS I set `--max-alternate-alleles` to 7, in which case, the position with 8 alleles causes the error immediately after the warning. This is evident from the two log files for two different runs, below. ### Log from run with value of `--max-alternate-alleles` left at default value of 6:; ```; on-chinookomes-dna-seq-gatk-variant-calling]--% gatk --java-options ""-Xmx4g"" GenotypeGVCFs -R resources/genome.fasta -V gendb://results/genomics_db/chromosomes/CM031199.1 -O results/vcf_parts/CM031199.1.vcf.gz.

Testability,"I haven't been able to reproduce this locally by running `ReadsPipelineSparkIntegrationTest` repeatedly. In fact, it looks like another test is interacting with this one, since the stack trace references HDFS paths, but this test doesn't use HDFS at all. Another oddity: `TribbleIndexedFeatureReader` implies it's reading a vcf.idx file, but `HaplotypeCallerSpark`, where the exception occurs, is not reading any VCF files (although BQSR does earlier in the pipeline for known sites). Also, we shouldn't be serializing `FeatureDataSource` objects with remote resources any more, since we use Spark `--files` to copy them to the worker nodes (see https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/engine/spark/GATKSparkTool.java#L699).

Testability,"I see. . Yes. That's what I'm planning on (except that `AssemblyContigAlignmentsConfigPicker` is upstream of this unit), and here's the thought for why:; * I'd try to place the alignment picking step in a single place as much as possible, this makes improvements to the alignment picking/filtering step easier; * the size-based filter can be tuned, even by an CLI argument, this would affect the number of segments in the CPX logic, and the alt_arrangment annotations, and the simple variants re-interpreted by `CpxVariantReInterpreterSpark`, but it won't affect the alt haplotype sequence, which IMO is what really is important. ; * I'm developing a downstream variant filter, which hopefully can cut down the false-positives. And for the question of ""why 2 instead of 1"", I think what you are suggesting is to change; ```java; public static final int MIN_READ_SPAN_AFTER_DEOVERLAP = 2;; if (one.getSizeOnRead() >= MIN_READ_SPAN_AFTER_DEOVERLAP) result.add(one);; ```; to; ```java; public static final int MIN_READ_SPAN_AFTER_DEOVERLAP = 1;; if (one.getSizeOnRead() > MIN_READ_SPAN_AFTER_DEOVERLAP) result.add(one);; ```; Am i right?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4962#issuecomment-405619353:426,log,logic,426,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4962#issuecomment-405619353,2,['log'],['logic']
Testability,"I see. Yes, I think this is closer to the issue at hand -- for instance, we'll have variants that are called, then when we go back to the original alignments there will be no indication of alternate observations at the loci which the variants were called (and vice versa, we'll have original alignments that suggest a variant, but won't get called). In the worst cases scenarios, the haplotype alignments seem ridiculous compared to the original reads (e.g. my GATK forum post: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/community/posts/360075749392-Bamout-haplotypes-are-much-worse-than-bamout-tumor-reads-would-suggest). So, right, it's not the realignment of the reads, it's the alignment of the assembled haplotypes that complicates things. Thinking about it in this context though, I see we might be at an impasse (or back at square one with considering the assembly process). . My true fear is that we'll lose what appear to be definite-somatic variants in the original alignments because of the internal assembly + haplotype alignment engine. But I will say, it does seem like we see these problems for lower-coverage areas/variants, so I might be exaggerating the issue at hand. Maybe the solution for testing our expectations is to use higher depths to avoid bad assemblies and to apply some post-processing to the calls.

I divided the PRs for the `IndelRealignment` into 4 different sections for better review (2 components of indel-realignment, `RealignerTargetCreator`and `IndelRealignment`). This strategy is because I dissected the pipeline into the easy `RealignerTargetCreator` to found regions worth to look at (this could be marked as experimental/beta before the indel-realignment is in) and the more complicated and component-based `IndelRealigner` (the same as with other tools, this can be marked as experimental/beta until a really good coverage is achieved - in the meantime, I have some test with the current data in the repository and the GATK3 counterpart). There are two parts that are usable outside `IndelRealigner` that are worthy to separate into two commits, and might be useful for other tools/downstream projects: `ConstrainedMateFixingManager` and `NWaySAMFileWriter`. That's the reason of making the port in split PRs. One option can be to have the PRs open, and reviewed independently without acceptance until every component is ready.

To test, I ran `MarkDuplicatesSpark` before and after the change on a cluster on exome-sized data. . Before: 7.32 minutes; After: 7.43 minutes. So there was no significant difference in runtime with this change. This is probably because the part of `MarkDuplicatesSpark` that was changed is the `group by` on fragment/pair key, which actually is a fairly small part of the total runtime of MD; the rest is a shuffle to ensure the input data is queryname sorted.

Testability,"I tried to do it, and I'm afraid that it won't be trivial as I expected: because it is a facade, there is not accesibility to `Logger.setLogLevel()` and this is required to set the verbosity level in the command line. After explore a bit the code, it seems that [`LoggingUtils`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/utils/LoggingUtils.java) is the only place where a concrete implementation should be used. My suggestion is to move this class to a package that could be excluded by the backend user (because it contains methods to change the logging of log4j, I suggest `org.apache.logging.log4j`), which implements a simple interface/abstract class `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.utils.LoggingUtils` to set the log level (LoggingUtils.setLoggingLevel(final Log.LogLevel verbosity)`. The default implementation (that could be used by final users callid`super.setLoggingLevel(final Log.LogLevel verbosity)`) could setup the htsjdk and the java.util.logger.Logger. This implementation requires to change the `CommandLineProgram` to have a setter for the `LoggingUtils` to use, that could be set in `Main` (as in my PR for improve the extensibility of this class). The only pronblem is that it requires to be initialize with a simple implementation class of `LoggingUtils`, which should use the default. I think that this design does not break the behaviour of GATK, but introduce more complexity in the code. If you think that this is worthy, I could implement it today. @lbergelson, I'm not able to run Spark tools in a cluster yet, neither in gcloud dataproc, sorry.

Testability,"I was mistaken about this not being faster - I was using a counting function that Spark can optimise by pulling onto the map side so that the records don't go through the shuffle. I changed this to simply dump the processed reads so they have to go through the shuffle, and I got the following timings when processing a 121GB BAM file.; - With shuffle: 27 min; - No shuffle (two scans over input): 24.7 min (8% saving); - No shuffle (one scan over input): 17 min (37% saving). The version that does two scans is faster, but not hugely so. Removing a scan is possible, but requires the use of a sequence dictionary to find the end points of contigs. I've done this in the latest version of my branch (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/compare/tw_overlap_partitioner), but there are more edge cases to test. Before I do this, however, it would be worth trying this approach with the Haplotype Caller to see if it works, and if it is appreciably faster.

There are also some changes in the `ReferenceRegion` class, they appear to be mostly cosmetic, but this necessitated changing one parameter from `null` to `Strand.INDEPENDENT` in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/8a366c7ba570c61338f7109b86c3284b80d5cf47. The GATK does one lookup into the TwoBitFile (which creates one ReferenceRegion along the way) per read during BQSR and two per assembly region during HC, so this code is inside your inner loop. Again, all it should take to test this hypothesis is:. ```; git clone git@github.com:bigdatagenomics/adam.git; cd adam; git checkout adam-parent-spark2_2.10-0.23.0; git revert 1eed8e8e464f8f92a6e87afc1d334e751423e810; mvn install -DskipTests; ```. You'd then need to build the GATK with the JAR this generates. If this makes the perf regression go away, then we can easily revert this change in ADAM 0.24.0, which will release two weeks from now.

This check says that they must create it with some finite value. A more appropriate place for the sort of message you suggest is in the relevant denoising method. In the edge case you encountered, you used a BAM that was almost completely uncovered in all bins at the specified resolution, resulting in a sample median of zero.

Testability,"I'm new at this, so I may be missing something, but it looks to me like there is an issue with the conversion code in GenomicsConverter.makeSAMRecord() in com.google.cloud.genomics.gatk.common. I've been working on this bam file issue, correcting errors in the files used for tests. Many of the errors involve reads with FLAGs that indicate that they are in pairs, but the mate is not extant in the file, causing the error. A way to fix this without deleting the offending reads is to set the FLAG to zero and also modify the RNEXT, PNEXT, and TLEN fields, if necessary, so that the read becomes single (provided that the values of all of these fields are not important for the tests). However, when I do this, I find that tests that write and then read bam files fail, because when the just-written file is read back, SAM validation complains that the mate unmapped FLAG is set for an unpaired read. It turns out that the copy of the file written by the test substitutes the value '8' for '0' as the FLAG for the modified reads. The relevant code in GenomicsConvertermakeSamRecord() (line 170) is:. flags += ((read.getNextMatePosition() == null || read.getNextMatePosition.getPosition() == null)) ? 8 : 0;. The effect of this line is that all reads which have null mate positions, even those which the FLAG specifies as unpaired, get the mate unmapped FLAG set, causing the validation errors that i'm seeing. The reason the tests have not failed before is apparently that the existing test files do not contain any reads with FLAGs that specify them as unpaired. A simple fix for this would be to convert the line above to:. flags += ( paired && (read.getNextMatePosition() == null || read.getNextMatePosition.getPosition() == null)) ? 8 : 0;. The redundant parens in the original code suggest that something like this may have been intended,but the google genomics documentation at http://google-genomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/migrating_tips.html gives the following pseudocode:. flags += read.n",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/569#issuecomment-114101033:276,test,tests,276,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/569#issuecomment-114101033,4,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"
Testability,"I'm not completely opposed to that way of dealing with this, but I'm not yet convinced either. . I'm not sure I see how having an extra argument is somehow shorter than having one special value that is included in the description of the original argument. As in:. --trimWhatever | -trimWvr -- bla bla bla; default w; min x max y; to disable trimming, use z. . As for the documentation auto-generator showing the two args together, that is dependent on setting up the arguments so that the code specifies they are related, and adding some logic to the auto-generation to pull related arguments together. (As a contributing developer to a documentation auto-generator --the GATKDocs-- I can tell you that is not necessarily trivial and adds even more moving parts.) This also generates additional complexity for third-party developers of wrappers (such as Galaxy). Finally, it can be a source of confusion for users who are trying to look up an argument called ""-dont-Trim-whatever"" since presumably it's only going to be listed under T (-Trim-whatever) and not under D in the alphabetical list.

Testability,"I'm stepping into the 7 remaining test failures in the debugger, and I think they may just be fixed by overwriting the actual output of `GenotypeGVCFsIntegrationTest.testEntireVariant` onto the expected output for all the forced output test cases. However, this exercise has revealed some other changes:. `GenotypeGVCFsEngine.callRegion` contains the line `final VariantContext mergedVC = merger.merge(variantsToProcess, loc, ref.getBase(), !outputNonVariants, false)`. Since we want to remove the non-ref allele regardless, we should replace `!outputNonVariants` with `true`. It is important to do this here, because only then does `regenotypeVC` correctly restrict the `AD` to the emitted alleles. Also, doing this strips the variant QUAL from the output if it's monomorphic, which is desired (the `RGQ` field is in the output, so there remains a sense of the quality of the call). Once you do that, could you check whether `removeNonRefAndUnusedAltAlleles` is still necessary?

These are also `HG19` (really, B37) variants, because Oncotator can't do `HG38` and I needed ground truth. So I need the B37 reference to go in so that these regression tests can be run.

This would be for when we find a problem variant in user data and need to add a new unit test. Anecdotally, I have found cases like this in some of the germline data that I've been running.

Testability,"I've implemented the Gaussian-kernel binary-segmentation algorithm from this paper: https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01413230/document This method uses a low-rank approximation to the kernel to obtain an approximate segmentation in linear complexity in time and space. In practice, performance is actually quite impressive!. The implementation is relatively straightforward, clocking in at ~100 lines of python. Time complexity is O(log(maximum number of segments) * number of data points) and space complexity is O(number of data points * dimension of the kernel approximation), which makes use for WGS feasible. Segmentation of 10^6 simulated points with 100 segments takes about a minute and tends to recover segments accurately. Compare this with CBS, where segmentation of a WGS sample with ~700k points takes ~10 minutes---and note that these ~700k points are split up amongst ~20 chromosomes to start!. There are a small number of parameters that can affect the segmentation, but we can probably find good defaults in practice. What's also nice is that this method can find changepoints in moments of the distribution other than the mean, which means that it can straightforwardly be used for alternate-allele fraction segmentation. For example, all segments were recovered in the following simulated multimodal data, even though all of the segments have zero mean:. ![baf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/29100464-ad687946-7c79-11e7-99e4-962ab93709b4.png). Replacing the SNP segmentation in ACNV (which performs expensive maximum-likelihood estimation of the allele-fraction model) with this method would give a significant speedup there. Joint segmentation is straightforward and is simply given by addition of the kernels. However, complete data is still required. Given such a fast heuristic, I'm more amenable to augmenting this method with additional heuristics to clean up or improve the segmentation if necessary. We can also use it to initialize our more sophisticated HMM m",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-321121666:425,log,log,425,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-321121666,2,['log'],['log']

Testability,"I've tried to study the code that turns a split read into a stranded interval pair so that it can be compared directly to the disparate read pair info, and I can't convince myself that it's correct. There seem to be a bunch of cases that aren't covered. For example, it seems to me that the first step would have to be reversing the cigars on negative strand SA's, so that you can see which pairs of SA's are genuinely supplemental to -- and potentially partially overlapping -- each other, and the actual order of the aligned sequences. (I'm sure this is unclear, too. We can talk.). Is there a unit test that mocks the reads we'd expect to get from an inversion breakpoint, both discordant and split.

Testability,"IMO. In fact ideally I'd like to write a design doc or something similar, and only code after the design is agreed on. --------. > I would of course prefer not to have to have a hard filter on length. This would mean we would never call a large inversion even if it exists. . Answer: Totally agree. Now looking back, it get clearer to me that this proposal contains two parts: the filtering part, and the breakpoint linking part, separated into two major classes `InversionBreakendPreFilter` and `LinkedInversionBreakpointsInference`. That being said, it doesn't make much sense to separate them into two PRs because _currently_ the filtering part is designed around the linking part, i.e. it is trying to check which BND's are suitable to the logic implemented in the linking part, and if the logic isn't applicable to an BND, the BND simply slips through without generating any new interpretations. So `InversionBreakendPreFilter` is a filter and a classifier at the same time, it function is really diverting different BND's to be handled by different logics, and it definitely should be improved.; If you buy this argument, I am also fully aware of the code design issue that it is preferable to NOT divert&mdash;gather&mdash;send through different handlers like it currently is for calling variants from the assembly contigs, instead it should be a single stream pass through all the BND's. I'll try to follow the preferred design. > What about some other filters more specifically aimed at the artifacts that cause these false large calls? I think it's a good idea to check annotations -- ie. do the mates lie at two regions that are segmental duplications of each other, or one side of the mate looks like a transposable element insertion? I guess it's ok to put in a tool with this limit temporarily, though. Answer: Agree. And I think these kind of checking are not only good, but a mandate for a good caller, i.e. to take advantage of prior knowledge. I am also thinking about improving it ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4789#issuecomment-406483929:1434,log,logics,1434,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4789#issuecomment-406483929,2,['log'],['logics']

Testability,If the second test passed in master then I don't consider it to be a good test of your fix. Can you make a test where the PLs with and without span del would lead to different QUALs in the old version? Maybe a case with a confident deletion in sample1 and a low quality SNP in sample2 that causes a spanning deletion in sample1.

Plus, although we could develop it here, it should really live in the Barclay repo if its truly generic. More importantly, I'm not sure the plugins in this PR should be plugins at all. Historically, plugins have required a lot of test development and iteration because they have command line arguments (the plugin system is for extending the command line parser with discoverable, re-useable components that are shared across multiple tools, and need shared command line arguments).

The problem is that we either add these numbers to the p-value or not by checking if they are less than or equal to some threshold. In this case these rounding errors can have a large impact (especially when the number of reads is relatively small) on the final p-value.

GATK3 GenotypeGVCFs for 20,000 human samples took 113.54 hours for about 1.9Mbp, but that was on a CombinedGVCF already extracted from GenomicsDB. With that many samples there are a lot of multi-allelics so that part should be similar to your data. The java options were `java -XX:GCTimeLimit=50 -XX:GCHeapFreeLimit=10 -Xmx11500m`, so still less memory than your task seems to need. And without `new-qual`.

Testability,"Java implementation of segmentation is now in the sl_wgs_segmentation dev branch, with a few simple unit tests. I'll expand on these and add tests for denoising in the future, but for now we have a working revised pipeline up through segmentation.

Testability,"Just trying to understand what the various issues are. . I opened a ticket to remove the GenomeLocParser #2125. GenomeLocParser is essentially a deprecated holdover from gatk3 that we haven't made the effort to completely remove yet. . Would it be useful if we packaged these small test files in the jar and had them automatically extracted when tests run? That would provide a basic set of example files that someone developing new tools could play with. . I think we mostly use BaseTest as a convenient way to find common files and a place to put common test functions like the `getTemp` family. Those are mostly statics that could be called from anywhere though. The only other stuff it really does is set up the the test spark context and set test logging verbosity. Moving the common files out of BaseTest might be a hard sell for people here, but we could extract a superclass that does the important set up and has the various functions without having the project specific files.

Testability,"K version in the ExcessHet documentation to 4.2.2.0, but we'll see if I need to revisit that.; - [x] Not quite sure about the `ReducibleAnnotation` business. Let me know how to make these changes, or else happy to punt and file an issue.; - [ ] Also not sure I've parsed the results of the Jenkins tests, at least in terms of comparing how many sites get hard filtered with/out the change. Where should I be looking at to see the baseline result for that step? Also looks like a lot of results for https://gotc-jenkins.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org/job/warp-workflow-tests/11755/ were call-cached, is that to be expected? Haven't looked at these tests before, so maybe you can walk me through them at some point. But I guess we can be sure that the overall results don't change too much (at least for 50 samples), which is a good start.; - [x] Didn't quite get to making those plots of the change in decision boundary, will do that tomorrow or later this week. EDIT: Nevermind, took like 5 minutes to throw them together (albeit using the slow python implementation and some for loops...), see below.; - [x] Hmm, looks like my own PR #6885 might've introduced a few more exact match test failures...grr. Here are some plots for N = 50, 100, and 500 samples showing (in black) those counts that previously fell under the 3E-6 threshold with the mid-p correction but now pass without it. As you can see, not much to sweat from these ""theoretical"" plots, but good to convolve with the actual allele frequency spectrum and get an idea of how many sites occupy these black squares in practice (as well as start us down the road of reexamining the threshold itself):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/132413689-37f3dfeb-e3f5-4869-a803-fe27f3cd79bd.png); ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/132413649-d716ee7d-6763-4275-82de-e0e226dcb1de.png); ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/132413673-11f54f3f-975c-46ab-b874-ec37e461694f.png)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7394#issuecomment-914612907:1314,test,test,1314,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7394#issuecomment-914612907,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Let's discuss more in person. It may be that the rounding is indeed a bug, but we'd want a regression test before we merge. For now, building a PoN using PCOV with noQC should be fine. (Note that QC is not the same as the filtering of targets/samples with too many zeros, etc., it specifically refers to the removal of samples with large events from the original PoN. But perhaps the ad hoc way this is done, along with the possible bug, is causing problems with the filtering step when creating the final PoN.) . Also, noQC is used in the WDL for a different reason---so that the small test BAMs can be used to build a PoN successfully. CreatePanelOfNormals belongs in the somatic workflow for now. You can think of it as a tool that produces a resource for denoising somatic samples. Eventually it will be replaced by gCNV, at which point we can discuss how the WDL should be organized. I can explain in more detail if you like.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3163#issuecomment-310879503:102,test,test,102,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3163#issuecomment-310879503,2,['test'],['test']
Testability,"Let's hear what others say, but I think I would strongly prefer to simply take over VariantEval in another repo if this was something you'd consider. I'd likely do much of what you propose anyway (certainly WRT testing); however, perhaps not the microscope we went through with the core GATK changes earlier. On plugins: I like what seems to be shaping up w/ Barclay. I carried over the Stratifier and Evaluator as plugins because it seems like it would make sense to allow tools to provide extensions (VariantEval, our tool, does). If I took this PR a step further, I would have migrated many arguments currently top-level on VariantEval into the plugins themselves (a good feature in Barclay). As an aside: I dont think VariantAnnotator is migrated yet, but we have many GATK3 plugins related to annotation, and hope that tool retains Annotator plugins when it get migrated. My impressions of barclay are probably a little out of date. I agree the main argument parsing framework is pretty robust. Specifically on plugins, it seems a little less so, or at least there are not many tools I visibly see exercising that part of the code. For example, there really should be a default implmentation or base class between Barclay's plugins and ReadFilter plugins. I'm guessing if more tools in GATK4 were using plugins this would have happened. I created something like this for VariantEval, and without a ton of work that could probably get generalized; however, doing so would throw a lot higher bar on me and as noted above I'm trying to take on less, not more at the moment. If we do take over VariantEval, I'm certainly happy to try to contribute code and experiences to improve the core, through more targeted PRs.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5043#issuecomment-407202501:211,test,testing,211,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5043#issuecomment-407202501,2,['test'],['testing']

Testability,"Like I said, I don't know enough to say if this approach is feasible, but sometimes it's possible to test an algorithm with a problem-generating function. This works well when it's easy to generate self-consistent solutions and test data consistent with a given solution. I was able to do this for some of the interval overlap functions on the python side of my code. Other methods were too complicated (for me to figure out anyway). Let's say you have an algorithm function f_algo that you want to test. You design a function test_data_factory that takes as input either a known solution, or a set of parameters from which it can easily generate a known solution (by a route that is logically distinct from the way f_algo works). Then f_tester generates and returns test_data. The flow looks like; ```; // get either random test solutions or some distinct set that tests particular edge cases; test_params = get_test_params();; test_solution = easy_solution_from_params(test_params);. test_data = test_data_factory(test_params, test_solution);; assert f_algo(test_data) == test_solution;; ```; In some sense you've already done that, but you've personally stepped in as test_data_factory(), and I'm wondering if it would be possible to automate that to get rid of all those numbers in the test code.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4677#issuecomment-384785429:101,test,test,101,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4677#issuecomment-384785429,8,"['assert', 'log', 'test']","['assert', 'logically', 'test', 'tests']"

Testability,"Looking at the code in both GATK's `GenomicsDBImport` and the GenomicsDB library itself, I don't think the sample name map was ever intended as a mechanism to rename samples. It was just added as a way to avoid the up-front download of all the VCF headers. As evidence for this, we have a couple of asserts like this in the code:. ```; assert sampleName.equals(((VCFHeader) reader.getHeader()).getGenotypeSamples().get(0));; ```. However, using the map file to rename samples is a pretty natural thing for clients to want to do.

Testability,"Looking at this example I would suspect that the problem is that all of the reads piled up on this site stop at position 14155455. We only see the PL=0,0,0 after position 14155446 in this GVCF. The GQ is determined by the GL calculation, the logic of which lives in `ReferenceConfidenceModel.doIndelRefConfCalc()`. Looking at that code it looks like it calculates the SNP GL and the Indel GL and chooses the most pessimistic outlook. Unfortunately every read at this site ends at 14155455, thus when we call out to `calcNReadsWithNoPlausibleIndelsReads()` we hit a snag since all of the reads in the sample have 9 bases left. If we check the documentation for that method we see the following line:; `Positions <= maxIndelSize from the end of the provided read/ref always return false`. This means that every read returns a value of false for indel informativeness since the result is too close to the end, thus we call into `getIndelPLs()` with a count of 0 informative reads, thus giving us the PL 0,0,0. .

Testability,"Looks great!. One quick note: I don't get the idea behind `Poisson` -- shouldn't we simply use negative binomials w/ modeled `mu_sj` and `alpha_sj`, evaluated at observed counts (`tt.arange(min_count, max_count + 1)`), and weighted with the number bins for each count (`_hist_sjm`)? i.e. if one observes an empirical distribution `P_obs(x)` rather than `x` draws, then the appropriate max likelihood objective function is `\sum_x P_obs(x) log P_model(x | \theta)`. Perhaps this is exactly what you've done and I don't get it. Another quick note: what I had in mind was _either_ modeling `mu_sj` at quantized ploidy states, _or_ let the ploidy state be unrestricted w/ a penalty via. a Bernoulli process (possibly w/ different per-contig penalties to account for e.g. higher rate of X/Y loss). We have enough samples in the cohort to select the quantized model (and those samples pin down the per-contig biases `b_j`). The samples that do not conform to quantized ploidy states can then choose whatever (variable) ploidy state they wish by paying a (hefty) price.

Testability,Looks like there was an R error in Carrot. Fortunately the actual meat of the Carrot test ran to completion (for the CHM) I have also checked that this matches for the exome and the NIST sample. I would say that these samples are exactly matching in terms of their VCFeval output and thus we can be confident that this branch did not break the standard pipeline path and we can call this 👍. ```; Type | Precision | Recall | F1_Score | TP_Eval | TP_Base | FP | FN | Stratifier | IGV_Session | UNK | Name | Truth_Set | Summary_Type | Comparison_Engine; -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --; SNP | 0.9706 | 0.9863 | 0.9784 | 3473278 | 3489284 | 105213 | 48308 | NA | gs://dsde-methods-carrot-prod-cromwell/BenchmarkVCFsHeadToHeadOrchestrated/7012fa81-18fd-4c9c-8722-22c9d7fa642d/call-CHMSampleHeadToHead/BenchmarkComparison/ae3dcac7-7105-4847-ac07-f9f64a43c4c8/call-BenchmarkVCFControlSample/Benchmark/67f50e9a-e7a3-4b31-9d14-d700b46ddfa5/call-VcfEvalWriteXMLfile/shard-0/CONTROLSNAPSHOT2018HG002_CHM_GRCh38_SYNDIPv20180222_vcfeval.xml | 539662 | CONTROLSNAPSHOT2018HG002 | CHM_GRCh38_SYNDIPv20180222 | summary | VcfEval; INDEL | 0.8814 | 0.8636 | 0.8724 | 485076 | 465627 | 65264 | 73548 | NA | gs://dsde-methods-carrot-prod-cromwell/BenchmarkVCFsHeadToHeadOrchestrated/7012fa81-18fd-4c9c-8722-22c9d7fa642d/call-CHMSampleHeadToHead/BenchmarkComparison/ae3dcac7-7105-4847-ac07-f9f64a43c4c8/call-BenchmarkVCFControlSample/Benchmark/67f50e9a-e7a3-4b31-9d14-d700b46ddfa5/call-VcfEvalWriteXMLfile/shard-0/CONTROLSNAPSHOT2018HG002_CHM_GRCh38_SYNDIPv20180222_vcfeval.xml | 429205 | CONTROLSNAPSHOT2018HG002 | CHM_GRCh38_SYNDIPv20180222 | summary | VcfEval; Type | Precision | Recall | F1_Score | TP_Eval | TP_Base | FP | FN | Stratifier | IGV_Session | UNK | Name | Truth_Set | Summary_Type | Comparison_Engine; SNP | 0.9743 | 0.99 | 0.9821 | 3384890 | 3391796 | 89358 | 34303 | HCR | gs://dsde-methods-carrot-prod-cromwell/BenchmarkVCFsHeadToHeadOrchestrated/7012fa81-18fd-,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8609#issuecomment-1850884297:85,test,test,85,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8609#issuecomment-1850884297,5,"['Benchmark', 'test']","['Benchmark', 'BenchmarkComparison', 'BenchmarkVCFControlSample', 'BenchmarkVCFsHeadToHeadOrchestrated', 'test']"

Testability,"Might be a dupe of https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4375 (note the date...). Continuing our discussion on Slack, we could add some tests on the simulated data that are suitably insensitive to numerical instability, but still check for whatever events may happen to be in the simulated data. I'm not sure if there's a record of the latter, as I would guess the data was generated with an external python script, but I suppose you could always just take what is currently output by the test as the expected result. There is some cost associated with adding, running, and maintaining such tests, and I'll leave it up to you and @mwalker174 to decide whether it's worth it.

Testability,"My GenotypeGVCFs run for a single chromosome returned the following completion statement:; 18:54:40.516 INFO ProgressMeter - Traversal complete. Processed 606308 total variants in 75.2 minutes. However, there are only 46814 variant rows (excluding 52 header rows) in the corresponding vcf file. Does the above figure of 606308 correspond to a multiple of 'variants x number of samples'?. Also, there are only 16863 lines in my log file, does this mean that the 'Current Locus' column in the log file doesn't correspond to a single genomic location (bp) in the fasta file?. I am curious to know what is the relation between all these figures to fully understand what is happening while processing the gCVF files. Also, on the inbreeding coefficient warning issue, I understand from your @Neato-Nick feedback that the variants with these warnings may still be fine and can be retained. However, this still leaves me worrying that out of 384 samples the locus doesn't even have 10 samples for generating the required metrics. Such variants won't be of any use for downstream analyses anyway where any variants with more than 80% missing samples will be removed. Therefore, I wish to seek some more information about this 10 sample thing - does it have some other context or does it literally mean that there are only less than 10 samples carrying that variant?.

Testability,"My first idea was to port it to ReadTools (that's why I asked to change it to the public code when GATK3 was divided into the non-free version and the plan was not to port indel-realignment). Nevertheless, someone showed interest into this and that's why I did this PRs; in addition, it is much better than the original authors (if still at Broad) can contribute to see if the port is correct. Anyway, I don't have any strong feeling about this, and I can always port the pipeline to ReadTools and maintain it there (actually, I had some ideas for other realignment methods and it will be interesting to compare with this). @cmnbroad - this was a long time ago, when even some of the standards (documentation and kebab-case arguments) were not even implemented. Regarding the tests, the last commit includes one using a BAM file in the repository, and the output was generated with GATK3 (if I remember correctly, although I can't remember the version). I think that the best way to go is to re-open a PR to have a cleaner history and proper standards. The idea will be:. 1. Copy of the GATK3 files (from the latest release); 2. Reformat (license and coding-style); 3. Port to the new framework.; 4. Convert documentation and arguments to the GATK4 format; 5. Add tests by running the latest GATK3 release on data in the repository and checking concordance. If a different dataset should be used for the tests, it will be nice if you can provide some.

Testability,"My first question is does this reproduce with a different PairHMM implementation? It might be a precision problem, in which case the prior should do a good job.

Testability,"My recollection is that this is a use case we never put any priority on so there's no test in the GATK suite for access to private files. There should be, of course. The feature is there and (at least locally) it worked when I tried it. NIO does not use the API_KEY, it uses default credentials. Those are environment variables that are set by the `gcloud` command or pre-set for you in the case of virtual machines on Google. There are two cases: local execution and Spark. . I just tested local execution and it worked fine for me:. ```; $ ./gatk-launch PrintReads -L Broad.human.exome.b37.small.interval_list -I gs://jpmartin-private/bench/WGS-G94982-NA12878.bam -O t_gcs.bam; ```. this command worked even though (unless I'm mistaken) neither the bucket nor the file are public. One challenge however is that the way to set default credentials has changed recently. Calling `gcloud auth login` used to be enough but now we have to call (IIRC) `gcloud auth application-default login`. For Spark, the default credentials are set as whoever owns the dataproc environment that's used to run the show. So it should be set so it has access to the buckets necessary. NIO has mechanisms for accessing buckets that belong to someone other than who is running the Spark job, but they are not hooked into GATK yet.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2394#issuecomment-277832658:86,test,test,86,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2394#issuecomment-277832658,4,"['log', 'test']","['login', 'test', 'tested']"

Testability,"Need some guidance here. The CompareSAMs tool was not propagating the validation stringency. I have a fix for that, but that alone doesn't fix the compareBAMFiles test in BaseRecalibrationIntegrationTest.java, since that uses SamAssertionUtils.assertSamsEqual, which also doesn't propagate (or accept) a validation stringency. Changing SamAssertionUtils to use either SILENT or LENIENT does fix the integration test, and all the other tests pass, but it seems like a relaxing of the stringency, and I'm not sure it should be necessary to the BQSR test. If relaxing the stringency for BQSR test _IS_ the right path, one possibility is to add a new method to SamAssertionUtils that accepts a validation stringency argument.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/419#issuecomment-109796266:163,test,test,163,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/419#issuecomment-109796266,6,"['assert', 'test']","['assertSamsEqual', 'test', 'tests']"

Testability,"No problem – I can see how this would be challenging to review – maybe it’s not even practical – if you decide it’s best just not to use it that’s OK - working on these issues has been a valuable learning experience for me. . I sent an archive with the new validations and the diffs between the old and new bams to akiezun. Although in many cases the files shared types of errors, I had to look at each file individually to take into account the particular errors in each file and how to fix them without (to the best of my knowledge) interfering with the purpose of the test. I did write a python script to use where necessary for converting multiple unpaired reads in a file to single reads, and I used bash scripts to call the picard tools to convert multiple files at a time from bam to sam for editing and then back again after they were modified. In some cases I had to modify the values in test output files to match the values produced by the test using the modified bams/sams, or just capture the new output files and use them to replace the old with the new. In two cases where file format errors appeared to be necessary but the filename did not indicate this, I renamed the files to make this clear.

Testability,"Now that I've spent a day surveying the landscape of p-values, I'm thinking what must've happened is that an undocumented mid-p-value correction was added to the one-tailed p-value we claim to calculate. This is probably a fine thing to calculate, but such a correction is not discussed in the annotation docs nor in the Wigginton paper cited there. Nor is this what is calculated by any of the other implementations out there, as far as I can tell. So we could keep the original calculation, while further clarifying what exactly we are calculating in the docs (and add references, if appropriate). In this case, we can just keep the cleanup and improved tests as a bonus. (As a further bonus, we won't lose our old friend 3.0103!). Or we could move to this calculation. In this case, I believe we would match the bcftools ExcHet p-value (although I still need to check this claim for correctness). I'm not sure if the original intent was to be more/less conservative in retaining sites during hard filtering prior to VQSR. But since the filtering threshold used in Best Practices seems very conservative, I would guess that we wanted to err on the side of not throwing out possible variants, even if they are pretty out of HWE. Which makes the choice of a mid p-value puzzling, since it's strictly smaller and will thus lead to more rejections (I think, if I've got everything the right way around!).

Testability,"OK - PedigreeValidationType is now set in the constructor and is final. This does not separate the two intertwined codepaths around PedigreeFile vs. FounderIds, but that was a pre-existing problem. It doesnt doesnt change the pre-existing weirdness around the timing of setting pedigreeFile and/or founderIds within GATKAnnotationPluginDescriptor, where PedigreeAnnotation gets special treatment. I dont think this makes that situation any worse. if you still have concerns on this proposal, I actually think I could make our code work if you simply exposed a protected getPedigreeFile() method on PedigreeAnnotation. I can make the SampleDB instance in my code without needed to share code here. It seemed useful to expose some of that code to avoid duplication, but if it's going to over-complicate we can remove it.

Testability,"OK @droazen @davidbenjamin I think this is ready for review. Note that:. 1) I did not restore the optimization introduced by @davidbenjamin in #5466. Happy to file an issue to restore it later by adding the appropriate parameter check, if we think it's important.; 2) I only added integration tests for HC and M2, since there is only a minimal test for FilterAlignmentArtifacts at this time. But I would think that these tests are enough to show that the exposure preserves behavior (unless I somehow got extremely unlucky with the test data and parameter values...); 3) Apologies to the reviewer for the somewhat complicated commit history, which resulted from introducing/removing the TSV stuff and was more trouble than it might be worth to reorder/resolve in the final rebase. I think it would be easiest for the reviewer to look at the 4 ""bubbled up..."" commits separately when reviewing the exposure of each parameter set, but then look at the overall commit when reviewing more superficial things or the tests.; 4) I'd appreciate it if the reviewer double checked that I did not switch anything up in parameter names, doc strings, default values, etc. when introducing the 12 explicit args in AssemblyBasedCallerArgumentCollection.

Testability,OK so [the script I wrote earlier](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/2bbc917d86942bdc0a72670cb3925ccd4d56e661/scripts/variantstore/repo/generate_git_filter_repo_command.sh) was really about figuring out which files in `ah_var_store` were candidates to be moved to a new `variantstore` repo and not explicitly about identifying cruft in our `ah_var_store` branch (though I did incidentally identify some cruft in the process of writing the script). However a couple of functions from this can be repurposed to find cruft:. ```; % comm -1 -2 <(files_deleted_from_master) <(files_added_on_ah_var_store) ; scripts/vcf_site_level_filtering_cromwell_tests/vcf_site_level_filtering_travis.json; src/test/resources/large/filteringJointVcf/test_10_samples.22.avg.vcf.gz; src/test/resources/large/filteringJointVcf/test_10_samples.22.avg.vcf.gz.tbi; src/test/resources/large/filteringJointVcf/test_10_samples.23.avg.vcf.gz; src/test/resources/large/filteringJointVcf/test_10_samples.23.avg.vcf.gz.tbi; src/test/resources/large/filteringJointVcf/test_10_samples.sites_only.vcf.gz; src/test/resources/large/filteringJointVcf/test_10_samples.sites_only.vcf.gz.tbi; %; ```.

Testability,"OK, @meganshand pointed me to the original Wigginton R implementation at http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/Exact/snp_hwe.r and the Hail implementation at https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/main/hail/src/main/scala/is/hail/stats/LeveneHaldane.scala, further mentioning that these may have been used for checking test values. Both of these use the recurrence relation, rather than directly computing the likelihoods as the python implementation above does. Note that the documentation in ExcessHet indicates that a one-sided p-value is intended to be calculated according to Wigginton. However, the Wigginton R implementation calculates a two-sided p-value, although expressions for one-sided p-values are commented out. The latter also seem to contain typos, perhaps due to R indexing:; ```; phi <- min(1.0, sum(probs[obs_hets + 1: rare + 1]) / mysum); ```; should be; ```; phi <- min(1.0, sum(probs[(obs_hets + 1):(rare + 1)]) / mysum); ```; See implementations in other languages at http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/Exact/, one of which I would presume was used to calculate the expressions in Table 1 of the paper. Finally, the Hail implementation instead calculates a two-sided mid p-value (see e.g. https://www2.unil.ch/popgen/teaching/SISG14/Graffelman_Moreno_SAGMB_2013.pdf), which oftentimes turns out to be the complement of the quantity that is *actually* calculated by ExcessHet. Not sure if these p-value discrepancies were sources of confusion, but thought I'd document.

Testability,"OK, I experimented a bit with removing the R install from the base image and adding the R dependencies to the conda environment in a branch and rebased on that. A few issues that I've run into or that came up in discussion with @jamesemery and @cmnbroad:. -I moved all tests that depend on R into the `python` test group (which should perhaps be renamed to `conda`). Note that some of these also fall into the `spark` test group---not sure if there is any special Spark setup done for that group, but we should make sure that they don't fail if they're not run with the conda environment. -@cmnbroad mentioned that some Picard tools that depend on R may break outside of the conda environment if the user does not have the R dependencies. -When we install R in the base image, we pull in a lot of basic dependencies (e.g., build-essential, various libraries and compilers, etc.) So when the R install is removed, it looks like many tests begin failing or hanging, perhaps because they are falling back on Java implementations (e.g., AVX PairHMM tests). We need to determine the dependencies for these tests and install them separately.

Testability,"OK, relaxed the exact match to a delta of 1E-6 (chosen because doubles are formatted in somatic CNV outputs as `""%.6f""`) and tests pass on Travis (modulo an unrelated intermittent timeout failure). Note also that I was also able to reproduce locally by switching between Java 8 and 11. Had to add some quick test code for doing the comparisons; not actually sure if we have other utility methods to do so somewhere in the codebase. Another interesting note: I tried to clean up the offending use of log10factorial in AlleleFractionLikelihoods, but this introduced numerical differences at the ~1E-3 level. I think all of the round tripping between log and log10 actually adds up. Some digging revealed that this was introduced way back in gatk-protected in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/commit/aeec297e104db9f5196cb8f8e6691133302474bc#diff-34bd76cb2a416a212e25cbfb11298207265fb9cced775918aefcdb6b91ebc247. Despite the fact that we could easily replace the use of log10factorial with a private logGamma cache, at this point I think it makes more sense to freeze the current behavior.

Testability,"OK, tests are finally passing. I think we are close to where a review is useful; however, i have three known questions:. 1) Do you have advise on dealing with raw -> generic lists/maps in StratificationManager and VariantEvalReportWriter? You'll see I put a placeholder cast() method in each that copies the collection as a placeholder. I didnt see a more elegant option. 2) From way back in this thread, there was discussion of making a proper DefaultPluginDescriptor. Currently I have a functional DefaultPluginDescriptor in the varianteval package, but this isnt fully fleshed out for general use. Would you be OK finishing this PR with that in place, after which I would be willing to do a separate PR to make that general purpose, or does this need to be done before this?. 3) What do you think about the total size of test files being added? One way to reduce some file sizes is to subset to only the sites relevant to the variant eval tests. In the case of more generic reference files this reduces size, but also lessens their potential utility for future tests that may share them. . Also, the stub from the GATK3 VariantEval3IntegrationTest is still there should you want to run it. It should pass every GATK3 test using GATK3 inputs, though it might take a little work to put all the GATK3 files in the same location (i received them as one data dump in one directory).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5043#issuecomment-431583201:4,test,tests,4,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5043#issuecomment-431583201,6,"['stub', 'test']","['stub', 'test', 'tests']"

Testability,"OK, thanks @ldgauthier, I think I've addressed all the comments but one. A little TODO list for my benefit:. - [x] Updated the GATK version in the ExcessHet documentation to 4.2.2.0, but we'll see if I need to revisit that.; - [x] Not quite sure about the `ReducibleAnnotation` business. Let me know how to make these changes, or else happy to punt and file an issue.; - [ ] Also not sure I've parsed the results of the Jenkins tests, at least in terms of comparing how many sites get hard filtered with/out the change. Where should I be looking at to see the baseline result for that step? Also looks like a lot of results for https://gotc-jenkins.dsp-techops.broadinstitute.org/job/warp-workflow-tests/11755/ were call-cached, is that to be expected? Haven't looked at these tests before, so maybe you can walk me through them at some point. But I guess we can be sure that the overall results don't change too much (at least for 50 samples), which is a good start.; - [x] Didn't quite get to making those plots of the change in decision boundary, will do that tomorrow or later this week. EDIT: Nevermind, took like 5 minutes to throw them together (albeit using the slow python implementation and some for loops...), see below.; - [x] Hmm, looks like my own PR #6885 might've introduced a few more exact match test failures...grr. Here are some plots for N = 50, 100, and 500 samples showing (in black) those counts that previously fell under the 3E-6 threshold with the mid-p correction but now pass without it.

Testability,"OK, that's reasonable. I'll dig into the other test changes. I can answer a few:. - Regarding passing the VariantWalker: I agree that's not an improvement by itself, but I would argue it's not that much different than it was. My plan is to pass a VariantEvalContext object, which would obscure any need to have knowledge of the walker. In an attempt to keep this PR simpler, I didnt complete that work. I do expect to make a second PR in relatively short order, once we get this resolved. - With respect to testEvalTrackWithoutGenotypesWithSampleFields and the different reference: I think the issue is that the old version (master GATK branch) didnt validate as strictly. When switching to MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart, the reference is required, and the tool will error if the contigs dont match. VariantEval on the master branch didnt really need the reference for anything, and was apparently more permissive if it didnt line up. It probably preferentially grabbed the dictionary from the VCF header.

Testability,"OK, the first test run I tried was with 1kb bins and *no additional normals*. Coverage takes about an hour to collect per BAM and ploidy inference takes about 10 minutes. A few things:. 1) Looks like we are concordant with the truth CN on X for all but 3/40 of the samples. The GQs for these discordant calls are low (~3, 23, and 25 compared with ~400 for most of the others). 2) However, we are striking out on over half of the samples on Y. We mostly call 1 copy when the truth calls 0. Mehrtash thinks this is because a) I didn't mask out any PARs or otherwise troublesome regions on Y and b) I didn't include any other normals. I'll try rerunning with a mask first, then with other normals, and then with both. Hopefully this should clear up with just the mask. 3) There are a few samples where we strike out because the truth calls 2 copies on Y and we call 1. Mehrtash pointed out that this is most likely because the prior table we put together assumes Y can have at most 1 copy. So hopefully these are trivially recovered once we relax this. 4) The GQs are weirdly high on 1, X, and Y compared to the rest of the autosomes. @ldgauthier any idea why this might be? If there's no reason, then something funny is going on within the tool. I haven't gotten a chance to plot any of the counts data yet, either, which may make things more obvious. I'll do this today.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4371#issuecomment-364234449:14,test,test,14,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4371#issuecomment-364234449,2,['test'],['test']
Testability,"OK, verified that numerical results in the gCNV WDL tests match 4.1.6.0. Not sure if @lucidtronix needs to run similar checks for the CNN. Other than needing to push a new base image after review, I think this branch is ready to go. However, as we discussed, we should highlight major changes (e.g., the need to run R plotting tools in the conda environment) in the release notes. @droazen can you assign a final reviewer?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5026#issuecomment-608460914:52,test,tests,52,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5026#issuecomment-608460914,1,['test'],['tests']
Testability,"OK. I found a potential solution. For this solution, we do not need to add or remove any dependencies. The only change is to the `log4j.properties` file (which configures log4j 1.x) to match the config specified in `log4j2.xml` (which configures log4j2). Now, GKL will use log4j 1.x to log, but the format will match the rest of GATK, which uses log4j2. This means that we have only one GKL for both GATK 3 and 4, at the expense of having to keep to config files, `log4j.properties` and `log4j2.xml`, in sync (which they probably should have been anyway, thought they weren't).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3416#issuecomment-320779413:286,log,log,286,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3416#issuecomment-320779413,1,['log'],['log']

Testability,"Ok, I think the main thing is to be able to explain/verify all of the tests where results changed:. - For the snpeff test, since the behavior on this branch seems more correct to me than master, I tried running the GATK4 test case inputs with GATK3, and it produces exactly the same results as this branch does. So I think that issue was introduced by the original GATK4 port, and is fixed in this branch.; - The rest of the tests with changed results don't seem to hit your breakpoint, though. So I think we need to figure out why they changed, and maybe also compare them with GATK3 (which can be a pain because the output format is slightly different).; - As you mentioned, you changed the reference for testEvalTrackWithoutGenotypesWithSampleFields, which seems to have only affected the number of loci processed. So I'm unclear why that change was necessary. If the test truly should have been failing without this change, will it still fail if the change is reverted ? If not, can we fix it, and either way there should be a negative test for that case. A few other general comments:. - I changed this PR to `draft` mode for now, which just better categorizes it for our internal workflow purposes. When its ready for a detailed code review we can remove the `draft` status.; - The `HashMap<FeatureInput<VariantContext>, HashMap<String, Collection<VariantContext>>>` can be wrapped in a class with just a couple of methods, so we don't have to manifest that long type all over the place.; - I know this PR still in an interim state, but passing the VariantWalker in as an argument to the comp methods doesn't seem like a step forward to me. If we can't solve that problem completely in this PR (which is fine, I'm all for trying to contain this), are those changes necessary ? Perhaps that part should just wait for the next round.; - Any new classes/methods should use `final` for variables and parameters wherever applicable, and public classes and methods should have javadoc.; - Finally, I'm",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973#issuecomment-744689987:70,test,tests,70,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6973#issuecomment-744689987,7,['test'],"['test', 'testEvalTrackWithoutGenotypesWithSampleFields', 'tests']"

Testability,"On the first question, we definitely appreciate how much work this will take. Often, porting the code is the easy part; developing new tests and test data can be a huge effort. I can try to find out if it would be possible for you to take the tool over - I know this kind of thing has come up before for other tools, but I'd have to ask around to find that out. @vdauwera do you have input on this ?. As for the plugins, currently in your branch `VariantStratification` and `VariantEvaluator` are modeled as Barclay command line plugin descriptors, and I was questioning whether thats necessary. Being a plugin is not necessarily required - `ReadFilter` and `Annotation` are both plugins, but they didn't have to be, and it takes quite a bit of work (again, mostly test development) to get a plugin right. Also, I'd consider the Barclay plugin framework to be pretty developed at this point, so I'd be curious to learn more about what issues you see. And yes, definitely don't check any of the large GATK3 test files into the repo, even temporarily. Take a look at [General guidelines for GATK4 developers](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk#dev_guidelines) if you haven't already. As you pointed out, new GATK4 tests that use smaller files would have to be developed. We'd want those to be included, and passing tests on the CI server, before we started reviewing the branch, so we know we're reviewing code that works and is covered by tests as much as possible. The second commit in my list above would have only your GATK3 java test files, etc (but not the big files, which you appear to have locally). The third commit would have your ported tool code, as well as the new test code, with the new tests enabled, as well as the smaller input files and expected results files.

Note that changing the ARD priors does change the *names* of the expected files, since the transform is appended to the corresponding variable name. DetermineGermlineContigPloidy and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls are missing exact-match tests and should probably have some, but I'll leave that to someone else.; - [x] Update other python integration tests.; - [x] Clean up some of the changes to the priors.; - [x] Clean up some TODO comments that I left to track code changes that might result in changed numerics. I'll try to go through and convert these to PR comments in an initial review pass.; - [x] Test over multiple shards on WGS and WES. Probably some scientific tests on ~100 samples in both cohort and case mode would do the trick. We should also double check runtime/memory performance (I noted ~1.5x speedups, but didn't measure carefully; I also want to make sure the changes to posterior sampling didn't introduce any memory issues). @mwalker174 will ping you when a Docker is ready! Might be good to loop in Isaac and/or Jack as well.; - [x] Perhaps add back the fix for 2-interval shards in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8180, which I removed since the required functionality wasn't immediately available in Pytensor. Not sure if this actually broke things though---need to check. (However, I don't actually think this is a very important use case to support...); - [x] Delete/deprecate/etc. CNN tools/tests as appropriate. Note that this has to be done concurrently, since we remove Tensorflow. @droazen perhaps I can take a first stab at this in a subsequent commit to this PR once more of the gCNV dust settles and/or has undergone a preliminary review?

Testability,PR updated after a rebase from a nearly a year old master. @ldgauthier @kachulis please review first (3rd last commit) . @davidbenjamin please review second (2nd last commit) on AlleleLikelihoods changes... these two commit are a bit entangled and would be a bit of work to split it in two PRs. I found a couple of bugs that does not seem to manifest themselves in practice and have splitted marginalization and evidence filtering in two steps. Filtering can use any given criterion (lambda) not necessarelly interval overlap. The last commit gathers changes in test files for the first (main) commit. Most of the differences in vcf are due to updated DPs annotations and some minor changes in PLs.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6055#issuecomment-558828882:562,test,test,562,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6055#issuecomment-558828882,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Per discussions with @fleharty, we are looking to significantly revamp the automated somatic CNV evaluations in preparation for benchmarking the TH prototype. The existing evaluations use a few unsupported/experimental tools and idiosyncratic/redundant classes (e.g., the `src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/copynumber/utils/annotatedinterval` class this issue concerns), the functionality of which we can hopefully move to python-based validation code. . The aforementioned code was purposefully decoupled from supported CNV code, but since then it has been incorporated into `Funcotator` tools and `ValidateBasicSomaticShortMutations`, at least. @jonn-smith @davidbenjamin can we discuss a plan for cleaning this code up?

Testability,"Rationale for engine changes:; This tool opens a large number of feature files (TSVs, not VariantContexts) and iterates over them simultaneously. No querying, just a single pass through each.; Issue 1: When a feature file lives in the cloud, it takes unacceptably long (several seconds, typically) to initialize it. A few seconds doesn't seem like a long time, but when there are large numbers of feature files to open, it adds up. This is caused by a large number of codecs (mostly the vcf-processing codecs) opening and reading the first few bytes of the file in the canDecode method. To avoid this I've reversed the order in which we test each codec, checking first if it produces the correct subtype of Feature, and only then calling canDecode. If you don't know what specific subtype you need, you can just ask for any Feature by passing Feature.class. It's much faster that way.; Issue 2: Each open feature source soaks up a huge amount of memory. That's because text-based feature reading is optimized for VCFs, which can have enormously long lines. So huge buffers are allocated. The problem is compounded for cloud-based feature files for which we allocate a large cloud prefetch buffer. (Though that feature can be turned off, which helps a little.) But the biggest memory hog is the TabixReader, which always reads in the index, regardless of whether it's used or not. Tabix indices are very large. To avoid this, I've created a smaller, simpler FeatureReader subclass called a TextFeatureReader that loads the index only when necessary. The revisions allow the new tool to run using an order of magnitude less memory. Faster, too.; Issue 3: The code in FeatureDataSource that creates a FeatureReader is brittle, and tests for various subclasses. To allow use of the new TextFeatureReader, I added a FeatureReaderFactory interface that allows one to ask the codec for an appropriate FeatureReader.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8031#issuecomment-1284340770:637,test,test,637,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8031#issuecomment-1284340770,4,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"Rebased and tweaked a few package versions, some of which are slightly different than those currently in the base (as is the version of R). Looks like `build-essential` is all you need in the base image for tests to not fallback on slow implementations, but we might want to double check that native dependencies are correct. Not really sure how urgent this is, and I have to admit I've lost track of the remaining ways R can break our builds.

Testability,"Regarding GenomicsDbImport with intervals, here is a quick test. Again, the thing I'm trying to evaluate is whether it matters how I chunk the genome for GenomicsDBImport->GenotypeGVCFs. Downstream of this, I would pass the workspace to GenotypeGVCFs, with --only-output-calls-starting-in-intervals. The concern is whether we have variants spanning the intervals of two jobs, and whether separating the jobs would impact calls. In this example, GenotypeGVCFs would run over 1:1050-1150. For example, if we had a multi-NT variant that spanned 1148-1052, we'd want that called correctly no matter what intervals were used for the jobs. I tried using running GenomicsDBImport with -L over a small region, or I ran SelectVariants on the gVCF first (which behaves a little differently), and then used that subset gVCF as input to GenomicsDBImport, where GenomicsDBImport is given the entire contig as the interval. The resulting workspaces will be slightly different, with the latter containing information over a wider region (GenomicsDBIport truncates start/end of the input records to just the target interval). . So if either of these workspaces is passed to GenotypeGVCFs, using --only-output-calls-starting-in-intervals and -L 1:1050-1150:. I think any upstream padding doesnt matter. If you have a multi-nucleotide polymorphism that starts upstream of 1050 but spans 1050, this job wouldnt be responsible for calling that. The prior job, which has an interval set upstream of this one should call it. I think GenomicsDbImport's behavior is fine here. If you have a multi-NT variant that starts within 1050-1150, but extends outside (i.e. deletion or insertion starting at 1148), this could be a problem. The GenomicsDB workspace created with the interval 1:1050-1150 lacks the information to score that, right? The workspace created using the more permissive SelectVariants->GenomicsDBImport contains that downstream information and presumably would make the same call as if GenotypeGVCFs was given ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7968#issuecomment-1221558244:59,test,test,59,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7968#issuecomment-1221558244,2,['test'],['test']
Testability,"Regarding the non-Docker integration tests failing earlier today, I think this was because the R packages were added to the Travis cache in #3101. @cmnbroad cleared the cache to see if we could reproduce a compiler error introduced in #3934 on Travis (for the record, we could reproduce it on my local Ubuntu machine and gsa5, but not on Travis).

After addressing these comments, can you please squash this branch into a single commit? As previously mentioned, this is easier if you just rebase onto the commit you're already on top of (ie., the commit before your initial commit, in this case bf993d8c6f6925ce6bdb67f50c0e33c6e5bc3336):. ```; git rebase -i bf993d8c6f6925ce6bdb67f50c0e33c6e5bc3336; ```. Then when the ""pick and squash"" screen comes up in your editor, select ""pick"" for the first commit, and ""s"" for all the others to squash into a single commit, followed by `git push -f` to push the squashed version of the branch to your fork.

Testability,"Right, so I'd seen that explainer of interval_list but wasn't sure how to go about generating an interval_list to test what I'm generating.

Testability,"SVIntervals are comparable, and provide the same total order as coordinate-sorted BAMs. They can encode any contiguous stretch of bases on the reference, or strand-sensitively on its reverse complement. They can encode 0-length intervals (i.e., locations) to indicate things like the precise, unambiguous location of an insert between two reference bases. They're super light-weight, and cache friendly (no references), and they can be compared and tested for equality quickly and locally. They know how to serialize themselves with Kryo. They have a much more complete set of operations to calculate overlaps and underlaps, total order, etc. How will we implement isUpstreamOf using SimpleIntervals, when SimpleIntervals has no concept of contig order?; I think we'd have a heck of a job retrofitting our code to use SimpleIntervals, and a lot of testing to do to prove that the performance loss isn't significant.

Testability,"So I just updated one of the newer tests, and now all of the tests for HaplotypeCaller seem to be passing locally. The previous commits updating the copy code were preserved when Louis reverted, so there were basically no changes I had to make to get this ""working."" That does leave us with one question now:. When looking into this a little with James and Louis earlier, we realized that the code for setting up the ActiveRegionGenotyper uses a weird partial copy of the standard CLI args method that has existed in the code for whoever knows how long. Conceptually this seems like a bad idea, but changing it now would possibly cause some older tests to fail, if they were based on this faulty method reasoning. Should we try to merge the PR as it is now, with all tests passing, and hopefully consistency with previous behavior, or try to update the logic around this genotyper as well at the same time?

Testability,"Some comments/questions for the review:; - I'll add a separate ticket to rewrite the integration tests, all of which pass and most of which are disabled since they require access to large files on the broad file system. In the meantime I need to add a couple of small tests to get the coverage back up, and would like to get the CR process started.; - I ported a bunch of support files but need feedback on whether they're in the right location.; - Somewhere I saw something that said GATK no longer supports .ped files ? If not, what should the replacement be in the tests require pedigree input?; - Is it a requirement to support Ploidy > 2 ? The current GATK tool, and thus the HB tool, do not; - I did not port the WalkerTestSpec.disableShadowVCF? Is that needed in Hellbender ?; - Are there other headers I should be applying to the output variant file ?.

Testability,"Sorry @cmnbroad, I misunderstood your comment before - what I've got is that it is ok to have beta/experimental for this, but it's obviosly not what you said, so my fault for not reading carefully. In that case, I would like to have a proposal for how to proceed here:. * I will implement the port for the tools in two independent PRs - just direct translation into the new framework, documentation and kebab-case argument style.; * The port for `RealignerTargetCreator` will be similar to this one; * The port for `IndelRealigner` would not have support for n-way output, although it will be fully functional in other ways. The n-way option can be ported in the future as an extra feature if necessary (maybe the communications team can weight in, and tell if it is really a needed feature); * For the first test, which will be removed before merging, I will use the data from the tutorial. This will be the validation for the port before test data valid for the repository is provided; * For the final tests, I will draft the class with the tests from GAKT3 without the data and disabled, waiting for @sooheelee for meaningful tests (or other people from your team). The main idea is to have two PRs with the port validated with the tutorial data, and add other tests similar to the GATK3's ones for extra validation and/or covering missing codepaths using @sooheelee or ported GATK3 data. Does it makes sense, @cmnbroad and @sooheelee?. @sooheelee - I think that the 1000G data can be a good validation if chromosomes 20/21 have realigned reads without a pair mapping on other chromosomes.

Testability,"Sorry for the late response - I'm only now getting a chance to look at this. I do want to clarify the exact issue you are raising here, do you expect `--force-output-intervals` to write out sites even when there is no evidence in the gvcf? I'm asking because in the issue describing this (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7005) you had mentioned something about how GenomicsDBFeatureReader required a reference and wasn't sure if you were implying GenomicsDB would get that info from the reference. My understanding of `--force-output-intervals` is that it would cause the resulting output to have homref info if there is evidence in the gvcfs (maybe @droazen can clarify/confirm). As such, the fact that you are getting `N` as the REF would suggest that there is no call made for that particular site. In fact, you can see this in the test case you have here. While it doesn't reproduce the issue, if you examine the output vcf file generated by the test:; - Output contains `N` for `20:10-20` but that is expected because the input gvcf says as much for the first 9999901 bases; ```; 20 1 . N <NON_REF> . . END=9999901 GT:DP:GQ:MIN_DP:PL 0/0:0:0:0:0,0,0; ```; - If you instead change `--force-output-intervals` to `20:9999902-9999910` you will notice that the output file now contains those sites with the right bases and corresponding homref calls:; ```; 20 9999902 .

In the case of `IndelRealignment`, I would like to leave out in the first iteration for the tool the `NWaySAMFileWriter`, to speed up development and add the support for split output later. Once I know this I will close the PR and sent another one with the `RealignmentTargetCreator`.

In the past i've separated the resources files per workflow directory (e.g. pathseq, cnn-hg38) but you can organize them a different way if the resources files would be shared by other workflows (e.g. somatic-hg38, somatic-b37).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6017#issuecomment-507703719:140,test,tests,140,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6017#issuecomment-507703719,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"Subsampling seems to be the way to go, see #2858. For the record, I did try to implement caching, but this results in excessive cache checking. In general, I think a better solution is to structure code so that expensive global quantities are not unnecessarily recomputed locally. At some point, this sort of undesirable recomputation snuck in during a refactoring of the allele-fraction likelihood code, probably when we tried to make the method for computing site likelihoods pull double duty based on the presence or absence of an allelic PoN. With an allelic PoN, we need to compute a log gamma at each site based on the site-specific bias hyperparameters; without a PoN, we only need to do this once for all sites, since the bias hyperparameters are now global, but the code naively recomputes it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2860#issuecomment-335621709:589,log,log,589,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2860#issuecomment-335621709,1,['log'],['log']

Testability,"Thank you @mehrzads for your contribution. It would appear that this optimization is aimed to incorporate the knowledge that we could never possibly visit a given vertex more than K times in the first K best paths. Since the graphs are prone to exponential expansion of paths this seems like an important safeguard against this exponential expansion of the graph. . Looking at the code and the algorithm behavior it is intending to copy I see that there is a degenerate case in the current code that can cause the results to be order dependent. My belief is that this code can fall over by virtue of the fact that we refuse to make new incoming edges to a given vertex if there are already too many incoming edges for that vertex. Unfortunately this heuristic doesn't strike me as being valid, because those incoming edges can have any weight, including very high weights because they are bad paths through the graph that we created at a previous step. . I think a more correct optimization would be to limit the number of edges we create LEAVING a given vertex. The logic for this is that while we may not necessarily see all of the incoming edges in the correct weight order we will necessarily see all of the leaving edges in the correct order because those paths are pulled off of the priority queue in the correct order. Thus we can safely ignore any additional paths we see leaving a given edge because by construction as they would necessarily have at least one path that is cheaper than all of the paths leaving the current node.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5907#issuecomment-494105417:1067,log,logic,1067,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5907#issuecomment-494105417,1,['log'],['logic']

Testability,"Thank you @vruano for your diligent review. I've implemented logger classes to encapsulate the metrics classes. Unfortunately the metrics classes must remain public in order to write output using `MetricsUtils.saveMetrics()`, but at least the tools aren't using them directly. There are two logging class groups - one for Filter and one Score. For Filter, there is an interface `PSFilterLogger` that is implemented by a file-logging class `PSFilterFileLogger` and a dummy class `PSFilterEmptyLogger` that does nothing. There are analogous classes for Score, but there is no Empty logger because it's not actually necessary. This adds a lot of new classes (maybe you can think of a better way) but usage has been greatly simplified. As we discussed in person, I don't think there is a faster way to count the reads in Spark. If you wanted to count the reads as they pass through, you would have to use some kind of atomic type that would be slow. Also it may be impossible to account for cases when tasks fail and restart. @lbergelson @droazen In this PR, I wanted to use htsjdk's MetricsFile and MetricBase classes for writing metrics to a file. I notice that these classes are mostly used for picard-related things. Is this the preferred way to do things? They do force you to expose public variables and also use an upper-case naming convention. On the other hand, they are somewhat convenient.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3611#issuecomment-334308160:61,log,logger,61,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3611#issuecomment-334308160,8,['log'],"['logger', 'logging']"

The order of the input intervals after parallelism were different from the original, so the random numbers generated for each position with redundant reads were possibly different.

Testability,"Thanks @bbimber, I have the file downloaded, please go ahead and remove it. I have reproduced the seg fault - it is because of one faulty fragment - `WGS_Sept_1117.gdb/QNVO02001147.1$1$28016/__58eb4600-9c95-425e-a585-4bb23b486577140340709598976_1596797671601`. Not sure why, but it seems to be missing a number of files(e.g. `__coords.tdb`) causing the fault. Things work fine if you move the fragment out of the array. . For what its worth, all the samples from the callset.json seem to be represented in the rest of the fragments. So you might be fine with downstream processing with `__58eb4600-9c95-425e-a585-4bb23b486577140340709598976_1596797671601` removed for now. . For our debugging, . 1.

Testability,"Thanks @bbimber. Just tested with the files you shared and the book keeping file uncompresses and loads fine. So, no problem on that count. As you have noticed, consolidation is very resource-intensive in GenomicsDBImport. When fragments are not consolidated on-disk during import, they get consolidated in-memory during queries. In this case, it is possible that with 79 fragments and with 10MB(hardcoded currently) being used per fragment per attribute just for consolidation, with memory fragmentation and other internal buffers, we may have run out of memory. Possible solutions -; 1. Can you run with something less that 178 with java heap options `-Xmx178g -Xms178g`, so the native process gets a little more?; 2. There is no way to perform consolidate only from gatk currently. You could try importing another set with the `--consolidate` and possibly the `--bypass-feature-reader` option.; 3. I am working on a fix for consolidation for Cloud Storage mainly, it may perform a little better generally and can point to a gatk branch when created if you are interested. @mlathara, any other ideas?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7674#issuecomment-1042407322:22,test,tested,22,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7674#issuecomment-1042407322,1,['test'],['tested']

So somehow, the first line has a non-informative PL omitted from the result, ; while the second line has the non-informative PL included (PL=[0]) in the result. My instinct is that PL=[0] should not appear in the VCF as it is completely uninformative: The length must be 1 since there's only one allele, and a PL or length 1 must be [0]. Do you agree?

Testability,"Thanks @kdatta. The branch builds now, but there are a couple of problems that cause several tests to fail, including some existing tests that used to pass. You can see the results [here](https://travis-ci.org/broadinstitute/gatk/jobs/221534229). - The main issue is that GenomicsDB fails to load. This causes the importer tests to fail, as well as the existing GenomicsDB integration tests. (Note that the importer tests fail with a null pointer exception, but that problem is secondary and only happens when the db fails to load, which is the root problem.) We can fix the NPE in code review, for now the main issue is fix the core problem of why genomics db fails to load. - The changes in OptionalVariantInputArgumentCollection and RequiredVariantInputArgumentCollection are causing argument name collisions in other tools, which is why ExampleIntervalWalkerIntegrationTest tests are failing in this branch. The simplest fix in the short term is to just revert the changes you made to those two classes, and remove the new VariantInputArgumentCollection class.

Testability,"Thanks @lbergelson! I agree that it might be good to break into more layers—could be worth talking to SV team and seeing what lessons they learned in putting together their hierarchy of images. Also, note that I pushed the install of miniconda into the base, but I did not push down the setup of the GATK conda environment itself (which takes the bulk of the time during the main-image build, as it requires lots of downloading). I think I commented elsewhere that a good strategy might be to set up the conda environment with the non-GATK python dependencies in the base, and then update the environment via a pip install of the GATK python packages in the main image. This would let us make python code changes without having to rebuild the base, but might require a bit of scripting to create a final yml for non-Docker users.

Testability,"Thanks @ldgauthier, that's definitely thought provoking. Perhaps you are right that for het-non-ref (i.e. 1/2 and similar) genotypes we should consider skipping the strand bias test. I had been assuming, incorrectly, that in a single sample case with a `1/2` genotype that the test would be based on the called alleles, not ref vs. alt. Just thinking out loud about this, I wonder if computing SOR on the `1/2` alleles would catch a small number of incorrect genotypes? I've been doing something analogous with allele balance filtering - whereby I compute a per-sample allele balance and directionality. If the genotype is imbalanced towards ref, I filter the variant. If the genotype is imbalanced towards a different allele I ""correct"" the genotype to be homozygous for that allele. In testing on reference samples from GIAB and PlatGen we are seeing that correct a handful of genotypes where the sample is really hom-alt, but called het due to a high error rate. . I'll read up on how the allele-specific strand bias works because I've never looked at that before. But I wonder if it's possible from the available annotations to get a SOR-like value for each allele that is that allele _vs_ all other alleles?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5698#issuecomment-466538825:177,test,test,177,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5698#issuecomment-466538825,3,['test'],"['test', 'testing']"

Testability,"Thanks a lot for looking into this @sooheelee - I understand the pain of making the small data for the tests, so I really appreciate your work there. I have almost prepare a PR for the new port of `RealignerTargetCreator` that will have TODOs for the test data prepared by you, and with some tests using files already in the repository (for the target-creator, I guess that the validation for getting the regions to realign would be enough, because thanks to that tests I realized of a small bug due to not including all the loci in the `LocusWalker`). On the other hand, I will still fight for the `--nWayOut` not blocking the inclusion of `IndelRealigner` in the first place. My reasons are the following:; ; 1. Looking a bit into the code of GATK3, there is a lot of complication to get the reader ID for each read. It will require to modify the `GATKRead` interface, the data source for reads, or find an *ad hoc* solution on `IndelRealignment` to set the procedence of the read. This requires going into the engine-level code, which in my experience is difficult to port from GATK3 and also slow on the reviewing/acceptance process.; 1. My idea for developing a new writer of general use as the n-way output (which can be used in other tools as well) is to factor out some code from `SplitReads` to have a custom `GATKReadWriter` for arbitrary splitting. i'm already using a similar solution on `ReadTools`, so backporting the code to GATK might be a solution. Nevertheless, this still requires that the `GATKRead` has somehow the identity store at the object level, which requires to address point 1.; 1. The use case of the tumor-normal pair can be resolved by an extra processing step (split by read group). I understand that it is quite convenient to add this argument, but I would suggest that until it can be develop.; 1. Last, bu quite important for me as a developer, I don't have time to spend looking at that engine-level features required to include that argument.

Testability,"Thanks for bringing this up! I actually think that I prefer option 1, although not ideal (since, as you say, it places more burden on the user). The whole point of having generically parameterized models is that we can apply them to many data types. To single out a few with hardcoded sets of defaults seems like a slippery slope to me. (Of course, we should definitely provide defaults for typical data types in *documentation*.) And in the end, I think it is beneficial for users that wish to tweak knobs to do some work to understand what those knobs actually do (even if just at a basic level). The other downside of option 2 is that it might not be immediately obvious from the command line what parameters are being used. For example, if a user chooses a set of defaults but then overrides some of them, we should make it so they don't have to go digging through the logs to see what parameters are actually used in the end. Nor should they have to go back and check what the defaults were for whatever version of the jar they were using at the time. Option 2 might also make it easier to inadvertently override parameters, etc. via command-line typos or copy-and-paste errors---it's much more straightforward to require and check that every parameter is specified once and fallback to a default if not, as we do now. Not to say that we couldn't get around any of these issues in Barclay, but I think it'll require some thought and careful design. Would be interested to hear Engine team's opinions. Finally, one point that I think will become more relevant as our tools and pipelines become more flexible and parameterized: I think we should start thinking of ""Best Practices Recommendations"" less as ""here is the best set of parameters to use with your data"" and more as ""here is *how to find* the best set of parameters to use with your data (for a given truth set, sensitivity requirement, etc.)"".

Testability,"Thanks for comments about the documentation @LeeTL1220 - I fixed them (I hope) trying to explain the logic behind the element tracker. In principle a developer shouldn't care about when to use them, because they should come from a `LocusIteratorByState` or from inside a previous tracker. In addition, the implementation should be (most of the cases) hidden from the API user, which should use `ReadPileup`. The idea of the trackers come from GATK3, so this is a custom port with some design differences. The basic idea is to cache some operations that may be time consuming for large pileups (sorting, split by sample, extract a single sample). I actually haven't test the performance in a proper way, just running some tools in development with the branch and it feels like is faster - in my case I use all the features that are cache: split by sample, retrieving several times single-samples and also calling `fixOverlaps()` (which uses using sorted pileups). I think that because the `LocusIteratorByState` is already splitting by sample, that can improve even more performance, because it will come directly in the state where it can be used by-sample in an efficient way. And maybe, if the tool does not require to split by sample at all, we can add an option to disable that behavior while creating the tracker.

The BAMs are aligned to GRCh38 and have undergone indel realignment (GATK3), so they represent a state of preprocessing against which we can validate the new indel realignment. If some representation of indels in such a BAM is sufficient as a truthset, then I can make this VCF. These samples, being from the 1000 Genomes Project, are well-analyzed and their indels will be represented in dbSNP and gnomAD resources. Of course, the test data will have been re-mapped with BWA and be without any trace of indel realignment.

Once I changed and used my personal account via `gcloud auth application-default login` GATK4 no longer gave that error.

So I went back to using the original file which has `foo.vcf.gz` as well as `foo.vcf.gz.tbi`. GATK SelectVariants ran successfully. Finally, I spun up a GCE-vm which is running with the service account I want, installed Java and GATK4 and was able to run the command successfully.

Testability,"Thanks for the response, @droazen! Technically, yes, that would be satisfactory & accurate... and if that's easiest, I'm fine with that. . From a user perspective though, it might be beneficial to report the first occurrence of this error, as that's most likely where I would go back to do future testing & troubleshooting. That being said, all of the overlapping intervals are already outputted to stderr, so all the information is retained regardless, and I could just look through the logs to find that first problematic interval. As an aside, I find it a bit weird that the overlapping interval message shows up as a _warning_ even when using the `-no-overlaps` option (I would assume it would be an error, not a warning). In my experience, most errors cause the program to quit immediately. So, perhaps instead, if this warning were an _error_ when using the `-no-overlaps` option, the program would stop after the first occurrence of this error... and then the error message would be accurate. Maybe that was the original intent of this code. But, again, if that requires much more testing & changes, when a quick rewording would also suffice, there's no need.

Testability,"Thanks for the review and running those tests, @ldgauthier! Will restore the aforementioned GnarlyGenotyperIntegrationTests and update a few other exact matches in the rebase this afternoon. You also asked above if there was a theoretical reason to change the threshold. Since it seems the original was relatively arbitrary (at least from what I've been told, happy to be corrected), I think we can leave it. The new annotation is strictly larger, so we will then be slightly more conservative about keeping sites if we leave the threshold fixed. You can think of this as a slight change in the decision boundary in genotype-count space---perhaps I can add some plots to this thread this afternoon to demonstrate. In practice, what we care about is whether: 1) many sites flicker across the change in boundary after hard filtering, and/or 2) these sites result in discrepancies post-VQSR. I think the tests you ran suggest that we don't need to worry much about the second issue, and I can take a closer look later to check about the first (which will depend simply on the number of samples and the allele frequency spectrum).

Testability,"Thanks for your feedback, @cmnbroad. In my case, I think that `IntegrationTestSpec` is a good way of avoid complicated code to test tool results, but it is true that it have some problems (one that I had was the usage for testing programs where the outputs are determined by a prefix in the command line, but with different suffixes). I think, from the API user point of view, that a class like `IntegrationTestSpec` to facilitate program output testing (including user exceptions) will be nice for developing purposes. Nevertheless, this is just a convenience that I asked for here, but I can try to solve the issues with the `BaseTest` instead. By the way, I would love to have this interface in GATK at least for now, because several of my tools rely on the `IntegrationTestSpecs` for development...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2122#issuecomment-243124889:127,test,test,127,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2122#issuecomment-243124889,6,['test'],"['test', 'testing']"

Testability,"Thanks very much for your analysis. Job 4 does create a lot of garbage, but that appears to be inevitable whenever you are dealing with a PairRDD: You have to use a Tuple2 to represent key and value rather than using a more memory-conservative custom data object. You end up with a gazillion tiny objects that survive only during the shuffle. Too bad they didn't base PairRDD on an interface like Map.Entry. Also too bad that you cannot force a shuffle on a (plain old, non-Pair) RDD. Why not just treat it as a key-only structure and allow repartitioning? I mention this not merely to whine, but also in the faint hope that you've developed some helpful workarounds. I don't think we have enough memory to persist the reads, but we can revisit that later. Job 5 *is* doing a lot of computation. It's turning each read into kmers and testing each of those kmers to see if they exist in a large hash table. I don't think there's much opportunity for further optimization -- I knew this would be a bottleneck and tried my best to make the code efficient.

Testability,"Thanks, @droazen. While I understand the effects of the funding landscape on academic resources, it seems to me this is a full capitulation of the GATK developer team given a serious bug, especially in light of the fact that the team seems to have enough resources to continue working on Mutect3. Mutect2 has been one of the best performing variant callers of the last years and is a major reason for the Broad's good reputation in the oncology bioinformatics field. GATK and Mutect2 are used by hundreds of institutions in clinical practice, affecting thousands of real patients' lives. Almost all of these institutions are likely to use clinical WES assays due to cost reasons and will thus have been directly affected by this issue _for the last three years_. Also, almost all of these institutions will never learn of this bug since they likely trusted in the developers to have proper functional regression tests in place. If this is indeed the best the Broad can do as an institution, then I will take your offer of providing a build of Mutect2 4.1.8.1 with the log4j vulnerability patched out - thank you. The one thing that I am asking for in addition (for the sake of the overall oncology bioinformatics community), however, is that you conduct a best effort to notify organizations (universities, hospitals, and biotechs/pharmaceuticals that you know are using Mutect2) and best-practise workflow owners (Nextflow, Snakemake, WDL, CWL etc. that include Mutect2) of the forced downgrade. Also, I think it makes sense to include a very prominent warning into the Mutect2 READMEs and GATK best practice documentations and guides. I know that this is work, too, but with success comes responsibility, and I can just hope that providing proper warnings uses less developer bandwidth than applying binary search to find out which of these [10 commits between 4.1.8.1 and 4.1.9.0 that are touching variant filtering (see below)](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/compare/4.1.8.1...4.1.9.0) bro",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1535909226:912,test,tests,912,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1535909226,2,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"The VCF input I used is dbsnp_138.b37.excluding_sites_after_129.vcf, at 2.3 GB.; It takes 0.47min to copy over. The local computation itself is only a few seconds:; 0.04min on the 4-cpu machine,; 0.05min on the 1-cpu machine,; 0.07min on the 1-cpu machine when ASYNC is on. Running with NIO takes:; 0.21min on the 4-cpu machine,; 0.59min on the 1-cpu machine,. A lot of the IO is done by the network card or operating system, so while we're prefetching on that thread, other threads can make progress. Not all of it, of course, so we pay a little bit of a cost as we have to switch between threads. The best scenario is one where there is both a lot of IO and a lot of computation, so we win most by overlapping them. The VCF case here is borderline because there is so little computation. The fact that we can make progress during IO is confirmed by the ""whole file"" case, where doing the reading and computation in parallel is faster than doing the copy first, then compute - even on a single-core VM. You're asking about `use_async_io_write_tribble`. I didn't set it explicitly and my logs show it was turned off in every experiment:; `INFO SelectVariants - Defaults.USE_ASYNC_IO_WRITE_FOR_TRIBBLE : false`.

Testability,"The advantage of using SLF4J is that it is a general facade, so it makes simpler to change for one logging system to other if the bound is implemented. For the most common logging systems (log4j, jul, JLC, etc.), there are this implementation and even no-op logging. One of the nice things from slf4j is that it allows to use the logging format set by the software to every library dependency, controlling the verbosity of other libraries too. . After having a look to the gradle dependencies, it seems that ADAM and Spark use slf4j. This will allow better integration with the two libraries: now the `slf4-jdk` is completely removed, and I don't know if this will blow up at some point if some of the ADAM/Spark classes try to load them. In addition, it will make GATK4 more general. Regarding features, I'm not using more that what log4j is providing, but I'm quite familiar with logback and I have a bias to use it if possible, but the GATK framework as it is implemented now ""force"" to use log4j. But anyway, I'm happy also with using log4j and I was only suggesting this for make GATK4 more general (and to come back in my work to logback, but that is just personal taste). @lbergelson, feel free to close the issue.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2176#issuecomment-259211054:99,log,logging,99,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2176#issuecomment-259211054,12,['log'],"['logback', 'logging']"

Testability,"The goal of this PR is to investigate if what needs doing to compile GATK and run its tests on Java 11. Some notes:. * The Scala 2.12 version of Spark 2.4 is needed to run on Java 11. I disabled `ADAMKryoRegistrator` in this branch since the version we are using is compiled against Scala 2.11. We might consider removing it entirely and no longer support ADAM formats directly in GATK - the workaround would be to use ADAM to convert to/from BAM/VCF. ADAM is also needed for reading 2bit files.; * Java 11 deprecates some APIs. Most of these are fairly easy to fix or suppress. The exception is the Javadoc API [com.sun.javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/jdk.javadoc/com/sun/javadoc/package-summary.html), which has been replaced by [jdk.javadoc.doclet](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/jdk.javadoc/jdk/javadoc/doclet/package-summary.html). The javadoc tools in `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.utils.help` may need to be re-written (and it's not clear if it's possible to support Java 8 and Java 11 simultaneously).; * Travis build. Getting this to build and test on Java 11 in addition to the current builds may be fairly involved as the matrix is already quite complicated. (The current PR just changes Java 8 to Java 11 for testing purposes - we'd need a way of getting both to run.). The vast majority of tests are passing on Java 11, the following are failing:; * Missing `TwoBitRecord` (from ADAM); * `ReferenceMultiSparkSourceUnitTest`; * `ImpreciseVariantDetectorUnitTest`; * `SVVCFWriterUnitTest`; * `DiscoverVariantsFromContigAlignmentsSAMSparkIntegrationTest`; * `StructuralVariationDiscoveryPipelineSparkIntegrationTest`; * `SvDiscoverFromLocalAssemblyContigAlignmentsSparkIntegrationTest`; * `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java.nio.ByteBuffer.clear()Ljava/nio/ByteBuffer;`; * `SeekableByteChannelPrefetcherTest`; * `GatherVcfsCloudIntegrationTest`; * `Could not serialize lambda`; * `ExampleAssemblyRegionWalkerSparkIntegrationTest`; * `PileupSpa",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6119#issuecomment-527179359:86,test,tests,86,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6119#issuecomment-527179359,2,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"The marginalization over all paths, not the the likeliest one, would make a small difference, but I'm not sure in which direction. In fact, I would even guess it would tend to favor the reference over a deletion because there are more contributions from things like TTTTT -> TT(DELETE A T)TT(INSERT A T)T that don't actually change the bases but do contribute to the sum. That is, if the reference has a longer poly-T, there are more places to put the cancelling deletion(s) and insertion(s). However, all this stuff incurs gap opening penalties and I would be surprised if it could make a difference as big as 0.07. I think I know what can, however. If you take a look at the top of page 3 of our pair-HMM docs https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/docs/pair_hmm.pdf, you will see, as @yfarjoun guessed, that there is a preference for shorter haplotypes in the form of a 1/haplotype length factor. And in fact, this amount seems to be in the right ballpark. For example, @ldgauthier's case is a 28-base deletion. If you calculate the log_10 ratio of the 1/length factors assuming a 100-base deletion haplotype, you get log_10(128/100) = 0.107. This, by the way, would explain why we don't see this sort of thing with insertions. We could simply say that any uninformative read (a log likelihood difference of 0.2) should go to the reference if that is the second best. That's basically the prior I was talking about. The M2-only solution would be to use the somatic likelihoods model on the haplotypes and remove unsupported haplotypes from the likelihoods matrix. Similarly, I could use it to align reads to the haplotype with the greatest posterior probability.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4829#issuecomment-393547216:1294,log,log,1294,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4829#issuecomment-393547216,2,['log'],['log']

Testability,"The point of the second test is to make sure that the new code path involving the spanning deletion has no effect if the spanning deletion has low likelihood. You could imagine that I introduced a bug where you lose sensitivity whenever a spanning deletion appears in the alleles list even if there's very little evidence for it, just because its potential existence sends the code down some new, incorrect, logic. I think `testSpanningDeletionIsNotConsideredVariant` is already doing what you want because before this fix the example VC is definitely considered to be variant even though the only non-ref evidence is for the symbolic `*` allele. The PLs in this example are 50, 100, 100, 0, 100, 100, which means that it is overwhelmingly likely that this sample's genotype is REF/SPAN_DEL. In the old code you get a qual of about 50 (the hom ref PL), whereas in the new code you get that the chances of a variant are about 1 in 10^10 since the only truly variant PLs are 100. Now, if you think a multi-sample case would be useful that sounds good to me. However, a ""confident deletion in sample1 and a low quality SNP in sample2"" would not look very different since the deletion would only exist in an upstream VC, not the VC being tested, so basically we would have sample1 = REF/SPAN_DEL, sample2 = REF/SNP with low quality.

Testability,"There is going to be a behavior different between the old iteration pattern. The existing code will iterate variants to establish whitelist of start sites, and then re-query variants overlapping those starts. This is generally identical in practice to MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart; however, when -L is supplied, it can give differences. I'm not sure which I think is correct. . Example, from VariantEvalIntegrationTest.testFunctionClassWithSnpeff():. // The DbSNP VCF has two variants:; // 1 1423281 rs374004343 GGAAGC G . .; // 1 1423281 rs79849353 G A . .; // If we use 1423281 as the interval, we find both. // The SnpEff VCF has these two:; // 1 1423282 . GAAGC G; // 1 1423286 . C G. The SnpEff VCF is provided as -L when running the tool. Both SnpEff and DbSnp will be used as drivingVariants. Therefore when we hit interval 1423282, the DbSnp variant 1423281:GGAAGC>G variant will be included, but not 1423281:G>A. When using MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart, this means only that variant is passed downstream. Previously, VariantEval would simply establish the whitelist of start sites (meaning the lowest from the group, or 1423281) and iterate them. This means that even though 1423282 is the interval from -L, it picks up the overlapping 1423281:GGAAGC>G, which effectively makes 1423281 a whitelisted start site. The existing behavior would iterate each start site and re-query overlapping variants in VariantEvalUtils.bindVariantContexts(). It would call:. List<VariantContext> prior = featureContext.getValues(track, referenceContext.getInterval().getStart());. In this instance, it would query on start=1423281, meaning it picked up both DbSnp sites, even though 1423281:G>A is not within the intervals supplied by -L. This is sort of a fringe case. I dont see how to fix this without reintroducing the expensive re-query step. I'm currently thinking that the existing behavior is probably what's wrong, but I'm going to consider this a little more.

Testability,There is really not much of a value other than a few potential variants being caught pileup callers and this was probably due to my pickiness. Regardless omitting intervals from the HC step to remove the restrain on entrophy calculations may be the ultimate solution as you indicated (Why didn't I try that before? - Probably I was too focussed on getting it done one way).

Testability,"There were a few issues with this case. First, the data source was not constructed 100% correctly. The config file is correct. . The index file is for the tar.gz version of the source data and not for the uncompressed version that they're using. The index should correspond to the source data in the file referenced by the config file itself (not a zipped or otherwise transformed version). Secondly, the source `tsv` data file has the header line for the table commented out. The Xsv codec is aware of leading hash marks as comments and will ignore any such lines. Because of this, the leading hash in the table header is ignored and the file cannot be properly parsed. The fix is simple - just remove the leading hash from the table header (the preceding line with the two hash marks is correctly interpreted as a file header because of the leading hashes acting as comments). Lastly, even if the user fixed the file they would still need to index it with`IndexFeatureFile`. At some point the code underlying this in `HTSJDK` was broken such that no Xsv files can currently be indexed.

Testability,"These are count files containing counts simulated according to the gCNV model, and are used as the primary inputs to generate the rest of the test files downstream. The dictionary is fictional and immaterial, so long as it is carried forward consistently from the count files to downstream outputs (which the tools do automatically). You could pretend that we started with simulated BAMs that were all aligned w.r.t. this fictional reference/dictionary. (It's just more work to simulate at the BAM level, which is why we start with the counts; simulating BAMs would also not increase test coverage in any meaningful way.). There are already a number of checks to guarantee dictionary consistency, but as you can see from that issue, there are a few scenarios where dictionaries from intervals might not be available via the engine. I don't think there should be a need to provide or check against external references/dictionaries at downstream steps; see point 4 in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6924#issuecomment-719576249 about reverting the code change to allow external dictionaries in PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls. If you like, you can switch the dictionaries in the test files to something real/canonical, but I would still revert the code change. Again, I'm not sure if there was some additional context that I'm missing---e.g., is there some big analysis going on where they need to override sequence dictionaries and/or checks due to mismatched dictionaries in the BAMs?

Testability,"Think it might be worth saving a VariantFiltration pass for the bit of code it'd take, but up to you!. ScoreVariantAnnotations will output both the raw ""VQSLOD"" score and the converted sensitivity, so we're free to specify thresholds on either. However, given that different types of models may have scores in different ranges (e.g., BGMM vs. IsolationForest, positive/negative vs. positive-only, etc.), I think it's better to restrict all command-line options to be expressed in terms of a sensitivity. Same thing goes if you decide to filter externally with VariantFiltration for now. Even though you have both quantities available to you, just use the sensitivity. This brings us to questions related to whether we want to keep the old VQSR requirements of having both training and truth sets specified. For example, we could instead drop the distinction between training and truth for the new tools, and always calibrate sensitivity to the training set (you can essentially force this behavior with the current code by specifying training=true,truth=true for all of your resources). And yes, all of the tools should have a variety of command lines in the tests to demonstrate behavior. If you want to explore positive/negative mode, take a look at the *Unlabeled tests.
