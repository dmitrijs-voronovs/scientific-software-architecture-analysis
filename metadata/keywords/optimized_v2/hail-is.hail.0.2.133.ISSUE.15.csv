Safety,"Made types final. @tpoterba I think you should rebase GenotypeView on this and use the new accessors there. We shouldn't be trying to optimize the traversal of types or the field access code now. The way to optimize these things is to make the types compile-time objects (as they should be) and these accessors will become code generators that turn lookups into things like `byteOffsets` into a compile-time constant. At some point I think we should go ""full unsafe"" by using off-heap allocation and change the (region, offset) pair into a Long. However, this makes error checking harder.

Safety,"Makes some further progress on simplifying the `PruneDeadFields` pass, with the primary goal of decoupling it from the details of the binding structure. The primary change is to `memoizeValueIR`. Before, it passed in only the requested type of the node, and returned and environment containing all free variables and their requested types. Any bound variables would then need to be removed, and the environments of all children then merged. This low-level manipulation of environments made it closely tied to the binding structure, essentially redundantly encoding everything in `Binds.scala`. Now we pass an environment down into the children, which maps variables to a mutable state tracking the requested type. Each `Ref` node unions the requested type at the reference with the state in the environment. This lets us use the general environment infrastructure. I didn't do an assertion directly comparing the old and new implementations, as I've done with some other pass rewrites.

This allowed users to pass tie_breakers that returned floating point numbers, but it *changed the meaning*. The sign of values with magnitude greater than or equal to one was preserved. All values in (-1, 1) were converted to 0, thus treating them as indistinguishable for the purposes of the MIS. This PR fixes this long standing bug and adds a simple test for that case. Supporting arbitrary numeric types is actually quite simple! The conversion from any Hail numeric type to float64 is sign-preserving (AFAIK), which is the only property we need to preserve the user's intended ordering. This change also introduces two mild, obvious performance improvements:; - Use one region for the entire MIS calculation, clearing for each invocation of tie_breaker (MIS is single-threaded); - Read the tie_breaker value using simple Region and type methods rather than allocating a new SafeRow each time the tie_breaker is invoked.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7729:1052,Safe,SafeRow,1052,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7729,1,['Safe'],['SafeRow']

Adds new azure-mgmt-storage package requirement.; - Updated `AzureAsyncFS` to use `(account, container, credential)` tuple as internal `BlobServiceClient` cache key; - Updated `AzureAsyncFSURL` and `AzureFileListEntry` to track the token separately from the name, and extend the base classes to allow returning url with or without a token; - Update `RouterFS.ls` function and associated listfiles function to allow for trailing query strings during path traversal; - Update `AsyncFS.open_from` function to handle query-string urls in zero-length case; - Change to existing behavior: `LocalAsyncFSURL.__str__` no longer returns 'file:' prefix. Done to make `str()` output be appropriate for input to `fs` functions across all subclasses; - Updated `InputResource` to not include the SAS token as part of the destination file name; - Updated `inter_cloud/test_fs.py` to generically use query-string-friendly file path building functions to respect the new model, where it is no longer safe to extend URLs by just appending new segments with `+ ""/""` because there may be a query string, and added `'sas/azure-https'` test case to the fixture.

Safety,"Picking up where #13776 left off. CHANGELOG: improved speed of reading hail format datasets from disk. This PR speeds up decoding arrays in two main ways:; * instead of calling `arrayType.isElementDefined(array, i)` on every single array element, which expands to; ```scala; val b = aoff + lengthHeaderBytes + (i >> 3); !((Memory.loadByte(b) & (1 << (i & 7).toInt)) != 0); ```; process elements in groups of 64, and load the corresponding long of missing bits once; * once we have a whole long of missing bits, we can be smarter than branching on each bit. After flipping to get `presentBits`, we use the following psuedocode to extract the positions of the set bits, with time proportional to the number of set bits:; ```; while (presentBits != 0) {; val idx = java.lang.Long.numberOfTrailingZeroes(presentBits); // do something with idx; presentBits = presentBits & (presentBits - 1) // unsets the rightmost set bit; }; ```. To avoid needing to handle the last block of 64 elements differently, this PR changes the layout of `PCanonicalArray` to ensure the missing bits are always padded out to a multiple of 64 bits. They were already padded to a multiple of 32, and I don't expect this change to have much of an effect. But if needed, blocking by 32 elements instead had very similar performance in my benchmarks. I also experimented with unrolling loops. In the non-missing case, this is easy. In the missing case, I tried using `if (presentBits.bitCount >= 8)` to guard an unrolled inner loop. In both cases, unrolling was if anything slower. Dan observed benefit from unrolling, but that was combined with the first optimization above (not loading a bit from memory every element), which I beleive was the real source of improvement.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13787:930,avoid,avoid,930,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13787,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

Purpose of this was to clean up the function a bit (some unnecessary assignments, code clarity), reduce the number of loops needed to detect a missing value. We don't need to check every bit O(N) to determine whether a value is missing. Instead, it is sufficient to check groups of at least 1 byte, and in the case that there are more than 64 values, groups of 8 bytes, or 1 byte. We could further improve this by removing the condition in the loop in favor of 2 loops (one over floor(nMissingBytes / 8), one over the remainder), but I think this gets us most of the benefit. We could also check for groups of 4 bytes (int) when groups of 8 bytes (long) are exhausted, but that doesn't really bring us much, since the major benefit comes from the largest batch group.

Safety,"So I'm of two minds here, and I don't quite know which to choose. Imagine we make an internal (service to service) request. It fails with a transient error like a timeout. What do we do?. Option 1. Retry. Option 2. Return a transient error 503 service unavailable to our client, and let them to decide what to do. I've implemented both options here: request_{retry, raise}_transient_errors. Which should I use in, for example, the auth decorators which hit the auth/userinfo endpoint?. I've chosen option 1 after bouncing back and forth a few times. I feel like retrying will give a better experience in the common case (a real transient error) and both will recover eventually in the case of a real outage. It appears that browsers don't retry 503 even with Retry-After header set. I'd want it to retry immediately or after a very short delay (1s). In the end, this is what convinced me we should retry. Currently CI uses option 1 when calling batch because it is hardcoded into the batch client. The signature of these functions match aiohttp.ClientSession.request. @danking I'm compelled by your concern that we have a potentially infinite loop of failures nobody will be notified about. I will follow up with another PR to add some logging to the request_retry function. Finally, I'm not quite sure why we're getting so many transient errors.

Safety,"Spark 3.3.0 uses log4j2. Note the ""2"". If you use the log4j1 programmatic reconfiguration system, you will break log4j2 for you and everyone else. The only way to recover from such a breakage is to use the log4j2 programmatic reconfiguration system. Changes in this PR:. 1. Include JVM output in error logs when the JVM crashes. This should help debugging of JVM crashing in production until the JVM logs are shown on a per-worker page. 2. JVMEntryway is now a real gradle project. I need to compile against log4j, and I didn't want to do that by hand with `javac`. Ignore gradlew, gradlew.bat, and gradle/wrapper, they're programmatically generated by gradle. 3. Add logging to JVMEntryway. JVMEntryway now logs its arguments into the QoB job log. I also log exceptions from the main thread or the cancel thread into the job log. We also flush the logs after the main thread completes, the cancel thread completes, and when the try-catch exits. This should ensure that regardless of what goes wrong (even if both threads fail to start) we at least see the arguments that the JVMEntryway received. 4. Use log4j2 programmatic reconfiguration after every job. This restores log4j2 to well enough working order that, *if you do not try to reconfigure it using log4j1 programmatic configuration*, logs will work. All old versions of Hail use log4j1 programmatic configuration. As a result, **all old versions of Hail will still have no logs**. However, new versions of Hail will log correctly even if an old version of Hail used the JVM before it. 5. `QoBAppender`. This is how we always should have done logging. A custom appender which we can flush and then redirect to a new file at our whim. I followed the log4j2 best practices for creating a new appender.

Added RegionValueBuilder which is useful for ... building region-based values (values allocated in a MemoryBuffer). `import_vcf` uses it to produces `RegionValues`/`UnsafeRow`. I left in `UnsafeRowBuilder`, but it is not being used (except by the tests). We should port over the region => region optimization, and remove it.

Got rid of `RowGenotype`, wrote `buildGenotypeExtractor` to be much better. I handled the serialization issue a slightly different way. See `BroadcastTypeTree`. Including your Kryo optimizations from unsafe-rowstore-2 would be good, too. It is still not as fast as 0.1, but generic and getting closer. This change has a lot of upside. Making things mutable now is trivial (just remove to `region.copy()` in `LoadVCF`, `ReadRowsRDD`, etc.) Tests spend a lot of time in methods that should eventually go away (e.g. `UnsafeRow.read`).

It will take around 5-6 hours to populate the tables and the remainder of the time is doing an audit. I think we should whiteboard what is going on in person, but the general idea is as follows:; 1. Revert any previous work and set the trigger back to the original state (idempotent); 2. Find the latest complete or open batch id. We know that a complete batch will not have updates to the attempts table. This is extremely important because the next steps can be done in parallel rather than serially.; 3.

In 10-way parallelism (maxes out a 4 core database), randomly populate the tables for each chunk.; 6. From the last offset (original first running batch id), we sequentially process attempts in groups of 100. We take note of where we are at with tracking any updates to the attempts table (`attempts_time_msecs_diff`), populate the `aggregated_*_resources_by_date` tables, and then do a final catchup step where we apply any updates from `attempts_time_msecs_diff` for any attempts that we have already processed.; 7. Once we have reached the ""end"" of the attempts table, we lock all tables of interest especially the `attempts` table, and do one last final processing step before we add the new triggers that will auto-populate the `aggregated_*_resources_by_date` tables.; 8.

I used an nginx limit to do this, but it is per pod, so I turned off autoscaling and increased CPU to roughly what I saw when 100K cores was hammering against a dead driver.; - Increase the worker exponential backoff from 30s to 2m. The main thing I was trying to address was the driver getting overloaded when trying to restart with a large standing cluster. It isn't totally clear why the cluster failed in the first place. I made a few other changes to mitigate the issue before adding the nginx limit, so I'm not 100% sure which combination of changes fixed the problem:. - I put a 60s timeout on the scheduler loop. This probably isn't necessary, although the scheduler does get bogged down if many of the instances it tries to schedule on are not responding. - I put a 10s timeout on mark_job_complete. - I put a maximum of 150 active mark_job_complete requests being processed, and returned service unavailable when the max was hit. I don't think this problem is completely solved. I think we want to keep the driver in the ~80% CPU load regime where everything is being processed quickly. I think we want to back off workers if, for example, mark_job_complete is taking more than 95%ile in the not overloaded case. I'm not sure who should do this, although it could be the batch-driver if internal-gateway is doing front-line throttling. Exiting in the overload case should be very cheap.

Safety,"The issue is we start billing for instances as soon as they're created with the API. However, if an instance is stuck in provisioning and never activates, we never update the start billing time to account for the lack of resource. This PR uses the `lastStartTimestamp` in the [Google REST API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances/get). This value is in RFC3339 format. I think this is the same format the timestamp in the activity logs, so I copied how we parse that value. If we delete the instance due to activation timeout, then we set the attempt start time to NULL so it's not billed. I couldn't find good documentation on this, but it seems like the `lastStartTimestamp` approximates what we care about for the purposes of checking for stuck workers. I checked it on an instance that was provisioning and the value was missing. Once the instance was in starting, the value was about 10 seconds after the `creationTimestamp`. . QUESTION: This does raise a question on whether we should be using the `lastStartTimestamp` when billing users if the difference is around 10 seconds. That will be a harder change, but is probably doable. We can't access the `lastStartTimestamp` through the metadata on the worker which would have been the easiest solution. We can get the compute client on the worker and access the `lastStartTimestamp` that way and set the job start time to the instance start time. I'd need to change the database for the attempts trigger to account for this. For the scenario where a job private job is cancelled while creating the instance, we would either need to make the additional API call or we just leave the time we created the instance.

Safety,"The original goal of this PR was avoiding `Try` when we are not using the restartability provided by semantic hashing because I strongly suspect it is related to the loss of stacktraces in exceptions. Unrelatedly, we realized the semantic hash PR changed the semantics of Query-on-Spark even when semantic hash is disabled: previously we would abort RDD writing on the first exception. In Hail 0.2.123 through 0.2.126, the semantics were changed to only crash *after* we already ran every other partition. Two bad scenarios of which I can think:. 1. Suppose the first partition fails due to OOM. We now waste time/money on the rest of the partitions even though we cannot possibly get a valid output. 2. Suppose every partition hits a permission error. Users should get that feedback after paying for O(1) partitions run, not O(N). I created two Backend paths: the normal `parallelizeAndComputeWithIndex` with its pre-0.2.123 semantics as well as `parallelizeAndComputeWithIndexReturnAllErrors` which, as the name says, returns errors instead of raising them. While making this change, I think I found two other bugs in the ""return all errors"" path, only one of which I addressed in this PR:. 1. I'm pretty sure semantic-hash-enabled QoB batch submission is broken because it uses the logical partition ids as job indices. Suppose there are 10,000 partitions, but we only need to compute 1, 100, and 1543. 0.2.126 would try to submit a batch of size 3 but whose job indices are 1, 100, and 1543. 2. Likewise, the Query-on-Spark path returns an invalid `SparkTaskContext.partitionId` which, at best, produces confusing partition filenames. I only fixed the former because it was simple to fix.

In fact, this current method of computing the variance (pre or post this pr) is known to be unstable when the mean is much larger than the stdev (as is easy to see: you're subtracting two nearly equal positive numbers). The Scala implementation used the spark `StatCounter`, which uses the more stable [Welford's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Welford's_online_algorithm).

Safety,"This PR adds `utils/StackSafe.scala`, which contains generic tools for writing stack safe code. To illustrate its use, I've converted `NormalizeNames` and `RewriteBottomUp` to be stack safe. This approach optimizes for the minimal possible change to existing code to make it stack safe. I originally expected this to have mediocre performance, and designed this to have optimization opportunities--requiring more substantial rewrites--where we found it was necessary. In a follow up PR, I converted the IR parser to be stack safe. In benchmarking that, I'm not able to see any performance penalty (if anything, the stack safe version looks slightly faster, which is probably just noise). So it's possible this will perform well enough as is, but we can keep an eye on it as we convert more passes. The basic idea is to rewrite functions that can be called recursively (directly or indirectly through a path of mutually recursive functions) from `f: (...) => A` to `f: (...) => StackFrame[A]`. Where the former evaluates, executing all recursive calls, and then returns the `A` result, the later returns a description of the work to be done before making any recursive calls. The method `StackFrame[A].run(): A` executes that description in a non-recursive loop. `StackFrame` is a monad, implementing `map` and `flatMap`, which allows the `for` syntactic sugar to be used. When a method makes several recursive calls, this can be significantly more readable. The public api is small. There are the free functions; ```scala; def done[A](result: A): StackFrame[A]; def call[A](body: => StackFrame[A]): StackFrame[A]; ```; and the methods; ```scala; abstract class StackFrame[A] {; def flatMap[B](f: A => StackFrame[B]): StackFrame[B]; def map[B](f: A => B): StackFrame[B] = flatMap(a => Done(f(a))); def run(): A; }; ```; `done` is basically the return statement. `call` is very important: it wraps a recursive call in a thunk, so that returning a `StackFrame` doesn't require descending all the way to t",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9320:85,safe,safe,85,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9320,5,['safe'],['safe']

Safety,"This PR adds support for Azure SAS tokens in QoB. A SAS token is basically a blob storage URI with a short-lived credential to access that resource appended as a URL query string. In such a scenario where the FS receives a blob URI with a SAS token, that token should be used instead of the latent credentials on the system. Most of the changes to the `AzureStorageFS.scala` are to parse out a SAS token from blob names. This change brings with it a couple caveats. Unfortunately it is not possible to truly disambiguate a SAS token from a glob pattern, or even just a normal blob filename. So we take what is probably a safe assumption and look to see if there exists a query-parameter style key-value pair after the last `?` in the blob name. If this is the case, we treat everything after the last `?` as a SAS token. If this condition is not satsified, we say there is no SAS token and treat the whole path as the blob name. This logic already exists in python, but I'm open to alternatives. Introducing SAS tokens also breaks the way globbing is currently implemented, where it is deemed safe to iteratively append components to the end of a blob URI string. I added an abstract type member to `FS` and instead of a `String` have `globWithPrefix` accept that associated URL type that can properly handle path updates. I'm unclear on the best way to do this w.r.t. the type system, and wasn't quite sure what to put as the associated type for `RouterFS`, which ideally would accept a union of the URL types for the filesystems that it wraps, so some guidance on that would be great if you have any.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13178:621,safe,safe,621,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13178,2,['safe'],['safe']

Safety,"This PR changes the semantics of TableMapRows in the IR and Table.select. They are now required to preserve the key ordering. In other words, applying TableMapRows to an ordered table can produce an ordered table without shuffling. I put an assert to verify that the produced OrderedRVD is really ordered, but that might be too expensive an assertion. Before, `newKey = None` meant ""keep the old key"", but that left no room to ask for the result to be unkeyed. Now `newKey` is just the key of the resulting table. If any partition key fields are modified, then even if the ordering is preserved, the result will need to be scanned to update the partition bounds. To avoid this scan when unnecessary, I added the `preservedKeyFields` parameter, which is the length of the prefix of key fields which are not modified. Thus, if the number of partition keys of the underlying OrderedRVD is less than or equal to `preservedKeyFields`, the partition bounds will remain valid. This feels pretty clunky, and I welcome better ideas. In particular, is there a way to compute this from the `newRow` IR?

Safety,"This PR introduces a generic pretty-printing package, which for now is only used in `ir.Pretty`. The primary motivation was to separate format specification from rendering, to simplify the formatting code, and make it easier to add multiple formatting options, including forms with line number references. Some nice properties of the new pretty-printer:; * Generic. Should be able to be used for all pretty-printing in hail scala code. This simplifies the codebase by making client pretty-printers easy to understand and modify, without getting bogged down in low-level details.; * Composable. Formatting specifications are trivially combinable, without needing to manually track context like the current indentation level, max line length, etc.; * Stack safe. Uses constant stack space.; * Uses constant heap space. Only keeps in memory text which might print in the current line, if it fits. (The pretty printer writes to a `java.io.Writer`, and I'm ignoring any heap space used by the writer.); * Lazy. If the number of lines to print is capped, doesn't scan more of the tree than is needed to print those lines.; * Produces more readable output, printing nodes on a single line where possible. As we work to increase visibility into the compiler, I think this will be very helpful. A formatted document is represented by the `Doc` type. This defines a `render` method, which takes three parameters to control the output:; * `width`: the maximum length of a line, including indentation; * `ribbonLength`: the maximum length of a line, not including indentation (too many characters on a line is hard to read, regardless of indentation); * `maxLines`: the maximum number of lines to print. There are only a few `Doc` constructors, which suffice to define all methods in the richer api contained in the `prettyPrint` package object.; * `Text(t: String)`; * `Line(ifFlat: String)`; * `Indent(i: Int, body: Doc)`; * `Concat(it: Iterable[Doc])`; * `Group(body: Doc)`.

After this goes in, these can mostly be developed in parallel. A few principles guided the implementation of copy: perform the minimal number of system calls or API requests per copy, and only do error checking when it doesn't involve additional FS operations. For example, it is too expensive to exhaustively check if we're creating a path that is a file and a directory in Google Storage. I considered doing additional and exhaustive checking for the actual copy arguments. For example, currently, `cp -T /path/to/file /path/to/dir` will not generate an error on Google Storage. In the end, I decided to go with the current behavior and I will add an option to do a postpass to check for file-and-dir paths. To achieve this, for each transfer, I simultaneously stat the destination (if needd) to determine if it is a file, directory or doesn't exist.

This PR originally prevented clients from speaking to servers with certs they didn't trust. Now everyone trusts everyone. As long as the root key is not leaked this is OK.

I had to add two new file operations to the `RichHadoopConfiguration` because I need seekable file input streams. I don't like the names. I'm not sure what to do here. Hadoop really screws us with the seek-ability on compressed streams. The implementation is rather simple, it just maintains an array of the per-partition results. The index of the array corresponds to the partition index. The sparsity of that array is controlled by how often we spill. For an operation with a huge number of partitions that are often spilled (e.g. large number of partitions, each with a lot of data), we may want to use a `Map` instead of an `Array`. The use of `ObjectOutputStream` without a try-catch-finally block is non-standard. I was having trouble seeking to individual classes when I used one ObjectOutputStream to output each partition's array. There were these ""bad header"" messages. This seems to work. I don't close the OOS because I'm going to re-use the underlying output stream on the next partition. We use O(n_spills) files. ---. ### Timings.

I have two simple examples of the partitioning behavior at the top of `LSMSuite`. In these cases, the number of elements is so small that the LSM perfectly stored the distribution, so there is no approximation. `LSMSuite` also contains tests that use enough keys so as to force the LSM to not keep them all. When the LSM has more than 10,000 keys, it starts sampling. It flips a coin that is true with probability `10,000 / n_keys_seen`. As we see more keys, the probability that the next seen key is kept decreases. If we decide to keep a key, we uniformly randomly choose a key to evict. The above is not entirely true. In reality, we keep 9998 keys in an array and separately keep the greatest and the least. Those are the true greatest seen key and the true least seen key.

Safety,"To properly implement IR sets, I need to staged UnsafeOrdering's, or, at the very least, I need to be able to call them from `Code`-land.

Whenever possible, I tried to call static methods. In a few cases, I couldn't figure out how to make that work, so I had to reimplement the operation in `Code`. I also had to introduce `BindingCode[T]` which is a type alias for `(FunctionBuilder, StagedBitSet) => Code[T]`. The function builder is used to allocate new variables and the `StagedBitSet` is used to compactly store boolean values.

This will allow us to avoid registering a set of LocusFunctions and LiftoverFunctions per reference genome/liftover, since the return type does not need to be inferred and we can just treat them as any other function with type-specific information.

Safety,"We've had to do a redeploy of our hail batch instance on Azure. This PR resolves/clarifies two issues we encountered. 1) Storage Account Name Uniqueness. Due to Azure's restrictions on storage account naming (mainly that names must be globally unique) the redeploy did not succeed. This is because the resource group name (we chose to reuse hail) is possible under a new subscription, but the generated storage account names were therefore identical to our previous stack. I've added in an argument called `storage_account_suffix` to account for this issue. It can be set to any arbitrary string that complies with Azure's storage account naming scheme in order to avoid naming conflicts in the future. While the option remains to simply choose a novel resource group name this is not enforced by Azure and anyone deploying a stack similarly named to someone else would not know until the `terraform apply` stage that the name would not work. 2) Mysql Flexible Server Zones. The only other issue is that the zone argument for the mysql flexible server is no longer always valid depending on your compute region.

Safety,"Will merge cleanly when https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3560 lands. I needed to remove `RegionValue.copy` and `Region.copy` because they necessarily create regions that aren't managed by an `RVDContext`. `RegionValue.copy` is only used in three places. . - `Table.toMatrixTable`: Here, I took the somewhat inefficient choice of creating `SafeRow`s. If `toMatrixTable` is a performance bottleneck, we might want to reconsider this. It's not totally obvious how to do this. I think I'd need to explicitly serialize/deserialize these values and modify `reduceByKey` to explicitly provide the `RVDContext`. Anyway, this works and I don't think it's _that_ slow. (I guess I should check that). - `OrderedRVD.localKeySort` & `LocalLDPrune.pruneLocal`: in both cases we need keep a handful of region values around per-partition. This does not lend itself to region-based-allocation. I solve this with two copies and a fresh region per value. Putting a value into `localKeySort`'s queue requires copying it into a fresh region. Taking a value out of the queue requires copying it into the consumer's region and closing/freeing the region it was living in. There fresh region is alive as long as the value is in the queue. I had to modify `RVDContext` to track `Region`s that get closed early. This seems a bit inefficient. Maybe I should track children as a `Set`?. cc: @cseed",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3579:343,Safe,SafeRow,343,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3579,1,['Safe'],['SafeRow']

I suspect our average VM count in a month is closer to 10 which is within the free tier (340 MiB). I; might be wrong abou the connections per vm per aggregation interval, but this is straightforward to; monitor once we have the logs. For a sense of the cost landscape, these are all free:. 1. 1000 VMs.; 2. 500 VMs, with a sampling rate of 1.; 3. 200 VMs, with a sampling rate of 1, with an interval of 5 minutes.; 4. 10 VMs, with a sampling rate of 1, with an interval of 30 seconds. It's all linear, so if we need to halve the interval we can either change the sampling rate, reasses; our expected number of VM-hours, or adjust the service fee accordingly. We can also assess the landscape of fees necessary to cover costs (ignoring the free 50 GiB):. 1. 15 minute intervals, 0.5 sampling rate, 100 expected connections per vm per interval: 0.0000008; USD per core per hour. 2. 30 second intervals, 1.0 sampling rate, 100 expected connections per vm per interval: 0.00005 USD; per core per hour. 2. 5 second intervals, 1.0 sampling rate, 100 expected connections per vm per interval: 0.0003 USD; per core per hour. 2. 5 second intervals, 1.0 sampling rate, 1000 expected connections per vm per interval (1000 unique; connections per second honestly seems to me quite remarkable performance): 0.003 USD per core per; hour. ```; USD_per_core_per_hour = bytes_per_hour / vms / 1024. / 1024 / 1024 * 0.5 / 16. print(USD_per_core_per_hour); ```. ---. # Conclusion. I think we're safe to enable this with the parameters in this PR (15 minute intervals, 50%; sampling). We can assess unknown parameters, like connections per vm, and get comfortable looking at; these logs. Security constraints or observability demands may push us towards desiring more logs.

Safety,"`java.nio` avoids unnecessary copies. We suspect we may see a 2-3x improvement in Zstd decoding speed by passing it `ByteBuffer` instead of `Array[Byte]`. We also suspect there may be pervasive (but minor) improvements to Hail's I/O infrastructure. We should start with the egregious examples. Consider `AzureStorageFS.createNoCompression`'s [`OutputStream`](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/main/hail/src/main/scala/is/hail/io/fs/AzureStorageFS.scala#L332-L342):; ```scala; val os: PositionedOutputStream = new FSPositionedOutputStream(4 * 1024 * 1024) {; private[this] val client: BlockBlobClient = blockBlobClient; private[this] val blobOutputStream = client.getBlobOutputStream(true). override def flush(): Unit = {; bb.flip(). if (bb.limit() > 0) {; blobOutputStream.write(bb.array(), 0, bb.limit()); }. bb.clear(); }; // ...; }; ```. Notice how we already have a `ByteBuffer` but we convert it to an array and send that to the OutputStream. Instead, we could just use the [`ByteChannel` methods of `BlockBlobClient`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.storage.blob.specialized.blockblobclient?view=azure-java-stable#com-azure-storage-blob-specialized-blockblobclient-openseekablebytechannelwrite(com-azure-storage-blob-options-blockblobseekablebytechannelwriteoptions)).

The next, more complicated problem, is the InputBuffer and OutputBuffer interfaces. These assume their sources/sinks are `java.io.InputStream` and `java.io.OutputStream`.

Safety,"ach and found it; more work than the current approach. ---. My apologies for eliminating JVMProcess in this PR. It's an unrelated change which facilitated my; understanding of worker.py. I essentially inlined JVMProcess into JVMJob and eliminated any duplicative; code. ---. After making this change I restored the tests. Some tests had bitrotted. In the process of fixing; those tests, I found a few other bugs. Fixing these lower-level bugs unlocked a number of new; tests. One test (which was added since the service tests were removed) had to be marked as failing. Some; Hail operations rely on writing to the local file system. Implementing that properly in the Query; Worker will take some thought. Here are the bugs I fixed:. 1. Correct the error message raised when tests are run in a non-main thread (we look for this; message and start an event loop for Hail's async code because asyncio refuses to start an event; loop in a non-main thread). 2. Use a `SafeRow` to copy the globals data out of a Region and into durable, GC'ed objects. 3. Re-enable serialization of GoogleStorageFS (including its private key, which we really shouldn't; do; Tim is working on it), which was broken (presumably) when we changed Scala versions. The; `var` modifier ensures the name is compiled as a JVM field. 4. Correctly convert from a `Byte` to an `Int`. By default `Byte` to `Int` conversion (which is done; automatically when you return a `Byte` from a function whose return type is `Int`) is; sign-preserving. That means that the byte `0000 1111` is converted to the `Int` 15 and the byte; `1000 1111` is converted to the `Int` -113. The contract of; [`InputStream.read`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html#read--); is to return the unsigned integeral value of the next `Byte` or `-1` if we've reached the end of; the stream. `DataInputStream` treats any negative value as EOS which lead to perplexing EOSes; when reading data from GCS. 5.

Safety,"ay in the common case of not needing the read to produce uids, we don't need to pollute the printed IR with large types.; * `hl.read_table` gets an option `_create_row_uids`, to allow for testing uids in python, and similarly for `hl.read_matrix_table`; * There are globally fixed default field names `TableReader.uidFieldName`, `MatrixReader.rowUIDFieldName`, and `MatrixReader.colUIDFieldName`. The full type of any `TableReader`/`MatrixReader` must contain these fields. If a consumer doesn't want uids, it just doesn't include them in the requested type. If it wants different field names, it must use a `TableRename`/`MatrixRename` node. This design ensures that the field pruner doesn't need any awareness of uids.; * An exception to this rule is if the written data already contains any of these special fields, in which case they are just read as usual. This ensures that a write/read in the middle of a pipeline can't change uid fields. We're making the assumption that these reserved field names are never used in user data, so if written data contains one of these fields, it must have been created by us, and so has the correct uid semantics. (Note that this was a late change, and I may have missed converting some readers to handle this case.); * The uids fields always come last in the row/col struct. Note that this requires some care when lowering MatrixTable, to make sure the row uid field comes after the entries field.; * `PartitionReader`s, on the other hand, must specify the name of their uid field. If this field is in the requested type, it will always be generated by the reader, even if the field already existed in the written data. It is now the responsibility of the consumer to choose the uid field name so as not to clobber an existing field.; * Added a trait `CountedIterator`, for iterators which keep track of a row index or file offset. The method `getCurIdx` should be called after `next()`, to get the corresponding index. This avoids having to allocate tuples.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12031:2191,avoid,avoids,2191,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12031,1,['avoid'],['avoids']

Safety,"basically, it now looks at the partitioner for the MatrixValues of its children when it executes, and only shuffles if rvds are non-disjoint. It removes empty rvds and separates children into non-disjoint piles, shuffles those independently, and then concatenates them together in sorted order. (I'm not sure how this behaves relative to the old behavior (coerce everything together) when we have multiple shuffles that need to happen, but at least filtering out empty RVDs helps a lot in e.g. the split-multi case where none of the variants need to be moved.). I think the (a?) better optimization would be to add smarter partitioning so that we're adjusting partition bounds and not really shuffling under most circumstances, but I thought I'd PR this first since at least there's a warning in python about unioning non-disjoint datasets (where this will avoid the scan). I also added tests for MatrixUnionRows and pulled out one of the simplify rules; TableUnion does an unsorted union (I'm not sure this is actually correct behavior now if the tables have keys) and pulling the union outside of a MatrixRowsTable can cause the ordering to be wrong.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4043:857,avoid,avoid,857,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4043,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

Safety,"cc @cseed, @jigold, @danking . Adds a `users.user_data` table reader. Upon login the user's `user_data` entry is read, stored in a `user` cookie, as a hmac/sha256-signed jwt. The secret key is the `'/notebook-secrets/secret-key'`. In order to avoid duplicating user data storage, I use the `user` cookie in place of `session['user']`, and to handle this wrote a decorator to decode the token and store it in Flask.g (for the duration of the request). The claims included:. ```python; {; 'id': [int],; 'auth0_id': [str],; 'name': [str],; 'email': [str],; 'picture': [str],; 'ksa_name': [str],; 'gsa_name': [str],; 'bucket_name': [str],; }; ```. An example cookie; ```python; { ; 'auth0_id': 'google-oauth2|000000000000000',; 'bucket_name': 'user-f2khk67pq8a9pc38wnbjigarg',; 'email': 'akotlar@broadinstitute.org',; 'gsa_name': 'projects/hail-vdc/serviceAccounts/user-f2khk67pq8a9pc38wnbjigarg@hail-vdc.iam.gserviceaccount.com',; 'id': 1,; 'ksa_name': 'user-4c4pr',; 'name': 'Alex Kotlar',; 'picture': 'https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QIkmrfGTN1M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reUAvw1lwovp2ozAIThEN72j-qzeQ/mo/photo.jpg'; }; ```. Here 'id' means `users.user_data.id`. To parse the cookie in your applications:; ```python; SECRET_KEY = read_string('/notebook-secrets/secret-key'). def jwt_decode(token):; if token is None:; return None. try:; payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=['HS256']); except jwt.exceptions.InvalidTokenError as e:; log.exception(e); payload = None. return payload. def jwt_encode(payload):; return jwt.encode(payload, SECRET_KEY, algorithm='HS256'). def get_domain(host):; parts = host.split('.'); p_len = len(parts). return f""{parts[p_len - 2]}.{parts[p_len - 1]}""; ```. And to use this (in Flask...aiohttp will be similar): `user = jwt_decode(request.cookies.get('user'))`.

Safety,"cc: @cseed . In preparation for the terra integration prototype, I've modified build.yaml to build and publish two public images. Both are versioned by the hail_pip_version. The first, `hailgenetics/hail`, contains hail, common python libraries, and the google cloud sdk. The second, `hailgenetics/genetics`, contains a slew of genetics tools that were used by the CCG Workshop. There is no R in any of these images. That is intentional. The image push step is scoped to deploy (but I tested it in my dev environment), so it only runs on deploy. Ergo, we should only update the image during deploy. I also added a safety check that doesn't overwrite an extant tag, if, for example, a deploy partially ran. Maybe we should update the image? I'm not sure.

Safety,"cc: @cseed @konradjk . This PCRelate should handle larger data sizes than the previous one by avoiding shuffles. It avoids the shuffle by writing the vds to a temporary directory in block matrix form. It then loads this BlockMatrix directly. Form that point forward, the PCRelate algorithm is just non-shuffling linear algebra (however: matrix multiplication will require each node to communicate with approximately `n+m` other nodes). I'm vaguely uncomfortable with two things:. 1. I've added some hail expr lang to mean impute missing values. This is written in python. As such, correctly mean imputing is not tested by our test system any more. The mean imputation is pretty simple, so maybe we should just verify my code is right?. 2. I noticed that at some earlier point PCA was moved outside of Java as well. This also makes me uncomfortable for the same reason. Moving the tests into python is a fair lift because, AFAIK, we don't have as robust test infrastructure over there. I'm torn between the desire to get this out for @konradjk and the desire to follow our normal testing standards. ---.

Safety,"cc: @daniel-goldstein, this is a tricky asyncio situation which you should also keep in mind. OK, there were two problems:. 1. A timeout of 5s appears to be now too short for Google Cloud Storage. I am not sure why but we; timeout substantially more frequently. I have observed this myself on my laptop. Just this; morning I saw it happen to Daniel. 2. When using an `aiohttp.AsyncIterablePayload`, it is *critical* to always check if the coroutine; which actually writes to GCS (which is stashed in the variable `request_task`) is still; alive. In the current `main`, we do not do this which causes hangs (in particular the timeout; exceptions are never thrown ergo we never retry). To understand the second problem, you must first recall how writing works in aiogoogle. There are; two Tasks and an `asyncio.Queue`. The terms ""writer"" and ""reader"" are somewhat confusing, so let's; use left and right. The left Task has the owning reference to both the source ""file"" and the; destination ""file"". In particular, it is the *left* Task which closes both ""files"". Moreover, the; left Task reads chunks from the source file and places those chunks on the `asyncio.Queue`. The; right Task takes chunks off the queue and writes those chunks to the destination file. This situation can go awry in two ways. First, if the right Task encounters any kind of failure, it will stop taking chunks off of the; queue. When the queue (which has a size limit of one) is full, the left Task will hang. The system; is stuck. The left Task will wait forever for the right Task to empty the queue. The second scenario is exactly the same except that the left Task is trying to add the ""stop""; message to the queue rather than a chunk. In either case, it is critical that the left Task waits simultaneously on the queue operation *and*; on the right Task completing. If the right Task has died, no further writes can occur and the left; Task must raise an exception. In the first scenario, we do not observe the right Task'",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11830:129,timeout,timeout,129,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11830,3,['timeout'],['timeout']

Safety,"ccessfully, the job is marked as scheduled.; 4. Once all requests complete, goto 1. On the worker, what happens inside `/api/v1alpha/batches/jobs/create`:; 1. Read metadata describing the job to schedule from the request body; 2. Using that information, load the full job spec from blob storage; 3. Spawn a task to run the job asynchronously; 4. Respond to the driver with a 200. The key point relevant to this issue is that the driver currently must wait for all the requests to workers in an iteration to complete before it starts the next iteration of the scheduler. This leaves the scheduler vulnerable to problematic workers or workers that happen to be preempted during the scheduling process. So, the driver sets a [2 second timeout](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/b27737f67bf9e69f1abed2fec07fc7c921790ef8/batch/batch/driver/job.py#L585) on the call to `/api/v1alpha/batches/jobs/create`. Additionally, this general design means that in the event of a request timeout or transient error, Batch cannot guarantee that there is always at most one concurrent running attempt for a given job. This ends up being a fine (and intentional) concession in practice because the idempotent design of preemptible jobs tends to cover this scenario, but it is regardless wasted compute and cost to users. Nevertheless, we strive to minimize cases where we might halt the scheduling loop or double-schedule work, and one way to do that in the current design is to minimize the variance in latency of `/api/v1alpha/batches/jobs/create`. The largest source of this latency is the request to blob storage. While GCS and ABS are relatively fast and highly available, Batch in Azure Terra requires first obtaining SAS tokens from the Terra control plane, which can introduce much higher and more variable latency.

Safety,"ch this to a disk-based index.~ Made it disk-based, called it `OnDiskBTreeIndexToValue` #3794. - each hadoop `FileSplit` now contains a possibly null (indicating no filter) list of variants (by index) to keep, in practice this should be quite small. - ~I changed several asserts to `if`'s with fatals, so as not to allocate strings~ Moved to #3771. - ~We no longer copy the genotype data into a buffer in the block reader. This was forcing the `fastKeys` to do an unnecessary data copy~ Moved to #3783 (with some substantial refactoring so it doesn't look much like this PR anymore). - ~I changed the contract on BgenRecord to require that `getValue` is called to ""consume"" the record before the next record is taken~ Irrelevant thanks to #3783 's refactoring. - ~`getValue(null)` just skips bytes (no copy, no decompression)~ Irrelevant thanks to #3783 's refactoring. - ~I added `RegionValueBuilder.unsafeAdvance` which can be used when you're creating an array of empty structs but don't want to do all the unnecessary RVB bookkeeping work.~ Moved to #3773. - ~I use `RegionValueBuilder.unsafeAdvance` to make loading a BGEN without entry fields very fast.~ Rolled into #3783. - ~I fixed `Table.index` to not trigger a partition key info gathering~ Moved to #3774. I had to ship the arrays of filtered variant indices to the workers somehow, so I shipped them as base64 encoded arrays of bytes. It's pretty groady (and that's why I added the commons-codec library). I don't know how else to initialize record readers with hadoop. Generally, I think the BGEN loading code could use a clean up, and I haven't done that here, if anything I've made it more complicated. I also need to check that there are tests for or write tests for:. - indexing tables doesn't cause an extra shuffle; - ~the include lid and include raid flags~ included in #3779; - the variant list flag; - `getSplits`; - the variant filtering code; - ~loading a bgen with no entries~ exists: `BGENTests.test_import_bgen_no_entries`",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3727:2797,unsafe,unsafeAdvance,2797,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3727,1,['unsafe'],['unsafeAdvance']

Safety,"d` an `OrderedRVD`, possibly with some non-empty key. This is consistent with the rule that the `rvd` must always have a stronger/longer key than the `TableType`.; * **small tweaks** - Now I start working through the `TableIR` nodes, rewriting them to remove explicit uses of `UnpartitionedRVD`. The general plan is to sandwich the rvd logic between `toOrderedRVD` and `toOldStyleRVD`. The first takes an `UnpartitionedRVD` to an `OrderedRVD` with empty key (and leaves `OrderedRVD`s alone), and the second takes an `OrderedRVD` to an `UnpartitionedRVD` if its key was empty, and leaves it alone otherwise. Once they're all rewritten this way, I redefine `toOldStyleRVD` to always return `OrderedRVD`, and `UnpartitionedRVD` is no longer used.; * **remove `TableUnkey`** - With `UnpartitionedRVD` going away, `TableUnkey` is no longer necessary, it's equivalent to keying by an empty key.; * **small tweaks** - these next two rewrite more `TableIR` nodes; * **Merge master** - the big one; * **tweak MatrixColsTable** - 1) Optimize `coerce` by checking if the requested key is empty, avoiding a scan in that case. 2) Optimize `sortedColsValue` by checking if the column key is empty, avoiding the sort in that case. 3) Simplify `colsRVD`, removing the case on the type of the `RVD`, just calling `coerce` and letting the previous optimizations avoid unnecessary work.; * **`distinctByKey` fix** - While looking over `TableIR` implementations, I noticed a bug in `distinctByKey`: you need to be sure no key is split across multiple partitions. To be sure the empty key edge case still works, I added a test to check that `strictify` on an empty-key partitioner will always collapse everything to one partition.; * **Flipped switch** - redifines `toOldStyleRVD` to just return the `OrderedRVD` unchanged, and asserts that `TableValue.rvd` is always an `OrderedRVD`.; * **rest of the `TableIR` tweaks** - added a factory method `OrderedRVD.unkeyed` to replace `UnpartitionedRVD.apply`.; * the rest are si",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4319:1894,avoid,avoiding,1894,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4319,1,['avoid'],['avoiding']

Safety,"ded_gather`, allows it to be used recursively. In particular, suppose we had a semaphore of; 50. The outer `bounded_gather2` might need 20 slots to run its 20 paths in parallel. That leaves 30 slots of parallelism left over for its children. By passing the semaphore down, we let our children optimistically use some of that excess parallelism. 2. If we happen to have the `StatResult` for a particular object, we should never again look it up. In particular, getting the `StatResult` for every file in a directory can be done in O(1) requests. Getting the `StatResult` for each of those files individually (using their full paths) is necessarily O(N). If there was at least one glob and also there are no `suffix_components`, then we can use the `StatResult`s that we learned when checking the glog pattern. The latter point is perhaps a bit more clear with examples:. 1. `gs://foo/bar/baz`. Since there are no globs, we can make exactly one API request to list `gs://foo/bar/baz`. 2. `gs://foo/b*r/baz`. In this case, we must make one API request to list `gs://foo/`. This gives us a list of paths under that prefix. We check each path for conformance to the glob pattern `gs://foo/b*r`. For any path that matches, we must then list `<the matching path>/baz` which may itself be a directory containing files. Overall we make O(1) API requests to do the glob and then O(K) API requests to get the final `StatResult`s, where K is the number of paths matching the glob pattern. 3. `gs://foo/bar/b*z`. In this case, we must make one API request to list `gs://foo/bar/`. In `main`, we then throw away the `StatResult`s we got from that API request! Now we have to make O(K) requests to recover those `StatResult`s for all K paths that match the glob pattern. This PR just caches the `StatResult`s of the most recent globbing. If there is no suffix to later append, then we can just re-use the `StatResult`s we already have!. cc: @daniel-goldstein since you've reviewed this before.

Safety,"e (almost always either "" "" or """"), or, if that would cause the line to exceed `width`; * print `body` normally, as described in the previous paragraph, allowing nested `Group`s to print either flat or normally. This pretty-printer DSL has become fairly standard, with some common enhancements that I don't think we need. It was first described in [A prettier printer](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf) by Wadler (though my implementation is completely different). This achieves stack safety by `Concat` taking an `Iterable`, so each contained `Doc` can be produced on demand. `render` pulls from these iterators, keeping in memory only things that might print to the current line, but where the format hasn't been decided yet. As soon as the formatting of a group is decided, as much of its body as possible is written to the `java.io.Writer`. A very quick and dirty performance comparison had the new pretty printer about 20% slower. That's paying for both the stack safety and the added smarts. And I think there's still room for optimization if it becomes necessary.

Safety,"e copy in Batch. After this goes in, these can mostly be developed in parallel. A few principles guided the implementation of copy: perform the minimal number of system calls or API requests per copy, and only do error checking when it doesn't involve additional FS operations. For example, it is too expensive to exhaustively check if we're creating a path that is a file and a directory in Google Storage. I considered doing additional and exhaustive checking for the actual copy arguments. For example, currently, `cp -T /path/to/file /path/to/dir` will not generate an error on Google Storage. In the end, I decided to go with the current behavior and I will add an option to do a postpass to check for file-and-dir paths. To achieve this, for each transfer, I simultaneously stat the destination (if needd) to determine if it is a file, directory or doesn't exist. For each source, I simultaneously try to copy it as a file and a directory. When copying each source, we don't need to know the type of the destination until after we've stat'ed the source, so stat'ing the sources and destinations are all overlapping. This avoids dependencies where I have to e.g. stat the input, decide what to do, and then perform a second action. I approached testing two ways: First, hand test common operations and errors (copy file, copy dir, overwrite, overwrite dir with file and vice versa, the various treat_dest_as settings, large files, detecting copy-and-files on input on Google Storage, etc.) Second, I enumerated essentially all single input transfers and recorded the results. These are then tested on every pair of file systems: file to file, file to gs, gs to file, etc. To make this run reasonably, I parallelize using xdist and the full tests (1364 tests) now take about 2 minutes. (If you restrict to the just the local filesystem, the tests just take a couple seconds.) The second test verifies that all cases run without unexpected errors, and that the behavior is file system independent.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9822:2072,avoid,avoids,2072,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9822,2,"['avoid', 'detect']","['avoids', 'detecting']"

Safety,"een a fluke. I see pretty consistent ~110MiB/s in the profiler's estimate of bandwidth to the FileOutputStream. When measured by `time python3 test.py` this script writes at ~93MiB/s. Ideally we would hit 250MiB/s (1/8th of an n1-standard-8's network bandwidth), but, considering that we have to split that bandwidth with reading in most cases, ~91 MiB/s ain't so bad. On main, this pipeline writes at 32 MiB/s. The wins in decreasing order of importance were:; 1. Use buffered I/O. All of our exporters should now use buffered I/O because I changed it in the EmitMethodBuilder. I didn't change it in HadoopFS because (a) Hail's native I/O has buffering and (b) buffering and position tracking requires work.; 2. Avoid String allocation, String to UTF8 conversion, and Array[Byte] allocation in VCF writing. In particular, for the most common types of Calls, I just return the UTF8 byte array in a switch statement.; 3. Use a fast path for diploid genotypes. In the worst case, we did 5 branches and now we do 2 which should be well predicted.; 4. Remove an allocation of a lambda in a hot method in Genotype.scala. Future Work:; 1. The randomness stuff still has a lot of low hanging fruit. NumPy can generate random numbers at bandwidths far above what we're managing here.; 2. For VCFs with more entry fields, we should not write ints and floats by generating strings and getting their UTF8 encoding; 3. Invert the writing control flow: serialization methods should take an OutputStream and write bytes directly into it. Contrast that with passing around arrays which are memcopied into a buffer. ---.

Safety,"efines this API on the Scala-side. After writing to cloud storage, the ServiceBackend submits the one-job driver batch to Hail; Batch. It then waits for the driver job to complete. When the driver job is finished, it reads the; outputs from google cloud storage and returns the results to the user. All the meaningful changes to batch are in the worker. The worker starts one jvm per core on; startup. The mainclass is a new class called `JVMEntryway`. This entryway starts a UNIX socket and; speaks a very simple binary protocol. It accepts only one type of message:. ```; int32 the number of strings to expect; (; int32 the number of bytes in the next string; byte* UTF-8 string; )*; ```. The array of strings is interpreted as:. ```; comma-spearated-classpath; main-class-name; arg0; arg1; ...; ```. The entryway constructs a URLClassLoader with the given classpath, reflectively allocates an; instance of the mainclass and invokes the `main` method with the remaining arguments. This is; obviously a security risk. The system bans JARs from locations not controlled (and locked down) by; Hail Team. You should require me to hardcode the mainclass as; `is.hail.backend.service.ServiceBackendSocketAPI2` before we merge; however, this flexibility was; useful during development. The JVMEntryway will eventually be useful because we will keep a ClassLoader full of a bunch of; JIT-optimized Hail classes.

Safety,"emory parameters, but once we have some user feedback I'd like to consider re-implementing computeGramianLargeN to use BLAS3 outer product on blocks of (fewer than m) rows of the n x m matrix rather than inner product on all pairs of columns, which I think will boost speed and make it reasonable to kill the smallN routine entirely (the current largeN case benefits from dot product of sparse vectors when using hard calls, but that also goes away when we move to generic 0.2 and rip out the hardcall/dosage complexity). Then it will be natural for maxSize to control the number of rows in a block. - Added accuracy and iterations parameters to allow users to tune Davies, with R settings for Davies (1e-6, 10k) as default. This allows users to re-run groups with tiny p-values if desired to obtain greater accuracy. The R package runs additional p-value routines that may be faster when the p-value is very small, will keep in mind should this become an issue. - In remark above the Skat class, I've added an overview of how math in paper corresponds to implementation. - Simplified and re-organized the Skat class to cut down on the number and complexity of passed parameters and make the meaning of the code more transparent with respect to the overview. Killed the SkatModel class. - Fixed an oversight whereby the largeN route was never called by logistic. - Fixed a bug whereby a weight of null was passed to DoubleNumericConversion.to and then Option rather than the other way around to prevent null match exception. - Modified R test code to use Adjustment=False to avoid the small-sample adjustment made in the logistic case when running using than 2000 samples. I could then reduce the Balding-Nichols example from 2001 and 500 samples and run logistic on the smaller test set as well. - Further cleaned up the tests, and added a test of the size column and maxSize parameter. - More descriptive error message should Cholesky or inversion fail in logistic case. - Updated docs accordingly.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/2248:2170,avoid,avoid,2170,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/2248,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

Safety,"ent level of indentation (`ifFlat` is explained when we discuss `Group`); `Indent` increases the indentation of all `Line`s contained in `body` by `i`; and `Concat` simply prints all documents in `it` sequentially. `Group` is the sole source of alternatives which `render` must choose between. `Group(body)` can be rendered in one of two ways:; * replace all `Line`s contained in `body` (including in nested `Group`s) by their `ifFlat` alternative (almost always either "" "" or """"), or, if that would cause the line to exceed `width`; * print `body` normally, as described in the previous paragraph, allowing nested `Group`s to print either flat or normally. This pretty-printer DSL has become fairly standard, with some common enhancements that I don't think we need. It was first described in [A prettier printer](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf) by Wadler (though my implementation is completely different). This achieves stack safety by `Concat` taking an `Iterable`, so each contained `Doc` can be produced on demand. `render` pulls from these iterators, keeping in memory only things that might print to the current line, but where the format hasn't been decided yet. As soon as the formatting of a group is decided, as much of its body as possible is written to the `java.io.Writer`. A very quick and dirty performance comparison had the new pretty printer about 20% slower. That's paying for both the stack safety and the added smarts. And I think there's still room for optimization if it becomes necessary.

Safety,"er. ; 4. Optional Array of Optional Int32 (450, 138). These arrays will have a bunch of LEB128 encoded integers, which, as stated, has a bunch of branches making this fairly expensive.; 5. `BlockingInputBuffer.ensure` is expensive. (705, 130). The blocking happens *after* Zstd. This dataset is about 16 GiB when uncompressed. The block size is 65kB (ergo 244k blocks the uncompressed dataset) When reading a large numbers of bytes, `ensure` is called infrequently compared to actually reading the bytes. However, LEB128 relies heavily on `readByte` and thus issues O(N_BYTES) calls to `ensure`.; 6. `Zstd.decompressByteArray` (249, 111). This is eliminated in main by commit 507744f2d7. Patrick's branch (on which I ran these experiments) is out of date.; 7. `BlockingInputBuffer.readBytes` (798, 88). I think this is a bit unavoidable: we have to copy bytes from input to the region. We could avoid the intermediary buffer: copy as much as possible from the buffer to the destination, then modify `InputBlockBuffer` so that it can read directly into the region while spilling any remainder into a provided buffer. For large reads this saves O(N_BLOCKS) copies and branches.; 8. `ZstdDecompressCtx.decompressByteArray0` (2017, 80). Yikes. Decompression ain't cheap, but, at least on this dataset, it's ~10x decompression ratio. If we had better datatype-aware compressors (like dictionary coding of strings) maybe we could skip Zstd and use something lighter weight. The remaining methods are pretty minor or would be addressed by one of the above mentioned mitigations. <img width=""1551"" alt=""Screenshot 2023-10-11 at 13 27 34"" src=""https://github.com/hail-is/hail/assets/106194/cfd855d6-8762-4b94-8e53-1ef881fde6ae"">. ---. ### Conclusions. LEB128 should not be a buffer spec for two reasons:; 1. It is too slow to be a our default integer encoding.; 2. InputBuffers and OutputBuffers do not expose vectorized `read` and `write` primitives.

Safety,"erted quantities are identical to the attempts that already exist in the database right after we converted the billing over to using resources. Once we have all resources for all attempts, the next step (future PR) is to do a scan and repopulate the new aggregated billing tables **by date**. In this PR, I don't try and add the usage to the existing `aggregated_*_resources` tables. I did this to cut down on time and space since we're eventually going to deprecate those tables anyways. Because I don't touch those tables, we don't need to worry about modifying the client code and how the current billing information is calculated. How this migration works is there are 5 phases:; 1. Compute the expected number of attempts to process for format version < 3. ; 2. Divide the search space into chunks of size 100 attempts (empirically determined this was the best chunk size) and randomize the order of the chunks.; 3. Serially process 5000 chunks with only 10 out of the 100 records as a ""burn in period"" to avoid the birthday problem when trying to insert records in parallel.; 4. In parallel, process all the chunks with 10 way parallelism (empirically determined to max CPU for a 4 core db instance); 5. Do an audit of the results to make sure the attempt resources now has the correct number of rows and the billing is within $0.001 per job with the old way and new way of computing the billing. The tolerance of $0.001 was empirically determined. At a threshold of $0.0001, 33/30,000,000 attempts failed. I think this is good enough as there's always going to be rounding errors. I did not do an explicit audit in the code to make sure the other aggregated_*_resources tables did not change. I spot checked this was correct in my test database. To do the complete audit during the actual migration would take more time. I made sure all the inserts were idempotent. Please double check this. The inserts use a temporary table with an isolation level of read committed.

Safety,"es the meaning of aggregation (`TableMapRows`, `AggFilter`, etc.), and which is implicitly referenced by any node which performs an aggregation (`ApplyAggOp`, `AggFilter`, etc.). This requires nodes to be able to bind variables which shadow variables already bound by parents, which it turns out wasn't handled correctly by the CSE algorithm. Fixing this required several changes:; * I moved free variable computation to a lazy value on `BaseIR`. This way, each time we see a subtree `x`, we can recompute the max depth of the binding sites of all of `x`'s free variables, since those binding sites may be different than last time we saw `x`. This also required splitting the free variables into value, agg, and scan sets, so they can be looked up in the correct context (previously context lookup was always done at the `Ref` node, at which point the variable was in the value context).; * Now, in the `CSEPrintPass`, we have to recompute the same binding depth calculation that was done in the analysis pass, so we know which binding site to look at (previously I just searched all binding sites in scope, but with shadowing handled correctly we don't have sufficient information to decide which binding site is valid). This requires maintaining contexts in the print pass, which is annoying because we are now traversing the tree of `Renderable` children, which is not exactly the same as the IR tree.; * To fix this, I duplicated all methods involving binding structure on `BaseIR`. To avoid having to write twice as many methods on concrete IR classes, I made the methods taking the index of the `Renderable` child (e.g. `renderable_bindings`) be the primary methods which are overridden. For all IR nodes, there is a map from IR child index to Renderable child index, defined in `renderable_idx_of_child`, which is used to define the `bindings` and similar methods in terms of the `renderable_bindings` and similar. This is messier than I would have liked, but I couldn't think of a better way.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7479:1803,avoid,avoid,1803,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7479,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

Safety,"ferred to Scala `Iterator` throughout most of the codebase, especially for iterators of region values. This is a low-level change, which could affect all code involving iterators, so I welcome feedback from everybody. The new abstractions are what I called `FlipbookIterator` and `StagingIterator` (I'm open to name suggestions). My goal was to simplify and raise the level of abstraction of most of the iterator manipulating code in the codebase당hich can be subtle and bug-prone, and difficult to read당hile paying as minimal as possible a performance overhead for the abstraction. This was surprisingly subtle to find the right abstractions and get their implementation right, and my hope is that all the non-obvious iterator code will now be concentrated in a small, well tested, component. `FlipbookIterator` solves the confusing behavior where `hasNext` potentially wipes out the current value. (All methods on `FlipbookIterator` and `StagingIterator` should obey the rule that methods defined without trailing `()` do not change the state of the iterator in any way detectable through the API.) The core interface of `FlipbookIterator[A]` consists of the methods. * `isValid: Boolean`; * `value: A`; * `advance(): Unit`. The metaphor is a flipbook, where when you turn the page, you no longer have access to the previous page; where you can read the current page as many times as you want (no need to copy it); and where you only know you've reached the end of the flipbook when you turn the page and find that the next page is empty. In `FlipbookIterator`, `advance()` turns the page, `isValid` asks if the page you are on is non-empty, and `value` gives you the value on the current page (which is an error if the page is empty). `StagingIterator` is a subtype of `FlipbookIterator` which adds a bit of state to each page, together with the methods `consume()` and `stage()`. The bit of state on each page tracks whether the value has been ""consumed"" yet. `consume()` can only be called on a",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3016:1141,detect,detectable,1141,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3016,1,['detect'],['detectable']

Safety,"he entire output in memory which is likely to cause OOMs. For reasons that are not entirely clear to me, sometimes these OOMs get muffled by our system and instead lead to non-termination. I vaguely remember this happening before with `using`. I suspect there is something somewhat subtle wrong with that method, but I am not certain. Anyway, there are four big changes here:; 1. Do not buffer the entire request body in memory when writing to memory.; 2. Because of (1) we have to pull retry behavior all the way up to the top-level where we know how to recreate the body.; 3. Because of (2) it is easier to provide a `write(url)(writerFunction)` style API, which I do here.; 4. Again, because of (2), and because I want to preserve the file-object-like interface, I added a somewhat funky anonymous class which uses a second thread to facilitate the movement of data written into the OutputStream returned by `create` into the OutputStream of the HTTP connection. Point (4) probably bears more explanation. The root issue is the bad Apache HTTP Client interface. Instead of `request` returning an OutputStream, it takes an ""entity"". An entity knows how to write itself into the OutputStream of an HTTP request. This works fine if the ""writer"" code is pased as a function (as in my new `write` method), but that does not work if the control flow looks like:. f = create(...); f.write(...); r.close(). We avoid this limited API by initiating the request in a second thread which will eventually block waiting to receive data from a PipedInputStream. That PipedInputStream produces the data written to a PipedOutputStream. The `create` call returns a positioned OutputStream which just writes data into the PipedOutputStream and handles cleaning up the thread when it is closed. In a multi-core system, network requests should proceed in parallel to the client code. In a single-core system, the written data will buffer until `close` is called which will definitely yield control to the other thread.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12691:1443,avoid,avoid,1443,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12691,1,['avoid'],['avoid']
Safety,"he mutation is sufficiently well localized, and this is a common compiler pattern. This touches a lot of lines, but the high level changes are:; * Remove the `refMap` from the `IRParserEnvironment`, and remove all code that modifies the typing environment from the parser. Nodes like `Ref` that need a type from the environment get types set to `null`, to be filled in after parsing.; * Add `annotateTypes` pass to fill in type annotations from the environment. This is currently written in the parser, and always called after parsing. This means for the moment we can only parse type correct IR. But in the future we could move this to a separate stage of the compilation pipeline.; * Move typechecking logic on relational nodes from the constructors to a `typecheck` method, which is called from the `TypeCheck` pass.; * Make the `typ` field on IR nodes consistently lazy (or a def when the type is a child's type without modification). Before we sometimes did this for performance, but it's now required to avoid querying children's types during construction.; * Make types mutable on `AggSignature` and `ComparisonOp`, so they can be filled in after parsing.; * Ensure that the structure in `Binds.scala` satisfies the following invariant: to construct the typing environment of child `i`, we only need the types of children with index less than `i`. This was almost always satisfied already, and allows us to use the generic binds infrastucture in the pass to annotate types (where when visiting child `i`, we can only query types of already visited children).; * Change the text representation of `TailLoop`/`Recur` to move the explicit type annotation from `Recur` to `TailLoop`. This is necessary to comply with the previous point. It's also consistent with `Ref`, where types of references are inferred from the environment.; * Add explicit types in the text representation of `TableFilterIntervals` and `MatrixFilterIntervals`, where the types were needed during parsing and we can no longe",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13990:3041,avoid,avoid,3041,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13990,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

Safety,"her aggregated_*_resources tables did not change. I spot checked this was correct in my test database. To do the complete audit during the actual migration would take more time. I made sure all the inserts were idempotent. Please double check this. The inserts use a temporary table with an isolation level of read committed. The reason for this is because `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` locks the next gap lock if the isolation level is not read committed. Maybe what I did is overkill and it's no longer a problem with the new burn in period. https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-locks-set.html I'd be interested to hear @danking feedback on what the best query here is to allow parallelism. There are ~30 million attempts that need to be processed for hail-vdc (~60% of the attempts). This will add ~20Gi to the existing database. I use 4 cores to get this migration to be ~3 hours, so we will want to **upgrade the database to 8 cores** while this migration is running. The inserting takes about 2 hours and the audit is 45 minutes or so. For the Australians, I think this script should be a no-op because I believe they started their instance after the billing changes went in around May/June 2020. The main thing to look out for is whether I got the interval queries correct! For example:. ```python3; where_cond = 'WHERE (attempts.batch_id > %s OR ' \; '(attempts.batch_id = %s AND attempts.job_id > %s) OR ' \; '(attempts.batch_id = %s AND attempts.job_id = %s AND attempts.attempt_id >= %s)) ' \; 'AND (attempts.batch_id < %s OR ' \; '(attempts.batch_id = %s AND attempts.job_id < %s) OR ' \; '(attempts.batch_id = %s AND attempts.job_id = %s AND attempts.attempt_id < %s))'; ```. The last thing is to do a sanity check and triple check the new database trigger won't run anything for format version < 3. Also, a sanity check that format_version < 3 is the right cutoff. I got this by looking at the `BatchFormatVersion` class where we have the cost function depending on format version.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11990:3826,sanity check,sanity check,3826,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11990,2,['sanity check'],['sanity check']

Safety,"if the job is cancelled. In addition, the ""Creating"" state is like ""Running"" for some operations in that an attempt has been created and actions are happening on behalf of the user. **Driver Changes:**; - New cancel_creating_jobs event; - Two separate methods to get the pools or job private UI pages and two separate configuration methods. One each for pool and job-private. **JobPrivateInstanceCollection:**; - Has two new loops: an instance creation loop and a scheduling loop; - The instance creation loop does a fair share calculation that is almost identical to the pool one except the resource being allocated is n_ready_jobs compared to total_jobs rather than ready_cores_mcpu. ; - The instance creation loop needs to extract the machine_type, storage_gib, and preemptible from the spec without hitting GCS. Therefore, it is stored in the ""spec"" field in the database which required changing the batch format version a bit.; - We avoid double scheduling by requiring that there are no live instances assigned to attempts for that job before creating an instance.; - We mark a job as creating after creating the instance for the new attempt; - The number of instances that can be created is similar to the pool control loop. The total number of instances we can create is fed to the fair share allocator.; - I added an asyncio.wait(15) at the end of the instance creation loop body to make sure we didn't run past our GCE limits.; - The scheduling loop iterates over all attempts with active instances in order of time of activation (no user fair share here -- FIFO); - There is no possibility of double scheduling because there must only be one active instance per job based on the create instances loop. **Canceller:**; - There's a new canceller loop that looks for jobs that need to be cancelled in the creating state. It marks these jobs as complete ""cancelled"" in the database and then calls GCE to delete the instance. **Mark Job Complete:**; - I modified this function to kill a job priv",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9972:2800,avoid,avoid,2800,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9972,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

Safety,"ire shuffles. The first change is easy. I added `RVDPartitioner.keysIfOneToOne` which looks; for these kinds of partitioners in the special case of keys consisting of 32-; and 64-bit integers. The second change eluded me for a long time. Finally, I discovered; `isSorted=true` and realized the optimizer refuses to modify such; `TableKeyBy`s. I exposed this field in Python as: `Table._key_by_assert_sorted`. With this infrastructure in place, I was able to implement read, write, and; matrix-multiply for DNDArray!. In addition, to the arguable hacks above, a couple pain points remain:; 1. I do not know how to rename keys in Python without triggering shuffles. If I; write `key_by(x=t.y, y=t.x)`, Hail implements this as; `TableKeyBy(TableMapRows(TableKeyBy(Array(), ...)`. The inner key by throws; the keys away so that they can be modified with TableMapRows. Unfortunately,; this completely defeats my attempts to avoid shuffles. I avoid this issue by; not using fixed names for the x and y block coordinates (their names are; stored in `x_field` and `y_field`).; 2. Hail lacks `ndarray_sum`. Instead, I convert from ndarray to array so that I; can use `array_sum`. Unfortunately, this operation seems to completely; dominate all of my time. It takes about 10x as much time as the matrix; multiplies take. I do not understand this. I should be reading the entries in; column-major order.

Safety,"lcome in the discussion here. # Idea; For any key type, create an encoding to variable-length byte arrays, which preserves the key ordering. That way, algorithms and data structures which use key comparisons can be written monomorphically, with `memcmp` as the only comparison function needed. Idea inspired by [Fast and Memory Efficient Multi-Column Sorts in Apache Arrow Rust](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/11/07/multi-column-sorts-in-arrow-rust-part-2/) blog post. But while they've optimized for vectorized encoding (which we currently can't do), I've preferred simplicity and smaller encodings. # Design; Type encoders can emit three kinds of output to a byte array buffer:; - byte - simply add a byte to the result, first padding an incomplete byte if necessary; - bit - add a bit to the result, possibly leaving an incomplete byte. We must know statically how many bits are used in the byte.; - pad - add `0`s to pad the last incomplete byte. This is safe (prefix-free) because the number of used bits is a (statically known) constant. We use this to ensure the number of used bits is known statically.; 	; Types:; - missingness; - treat as a type constructor `optional<T>`, i.e. base types don't encode missingness. Emits a single bit in the encoding. Can invert this bit to control whether missing values come first or last in the ordering. If missing, nothing is emitted after.; - sort-order; - treat reversing the default ordering as a type constructor `reverse<T>`; - simply inverts the encoding bitwise; - primitive types; - same as in datafusion, encoding has same size as original type; - signed integers - flip the sign bit; - floating point numbers - if sign bit is set, invert all bits, otherwise only flip the sign bit; - arrays; - before each element and after last element, emit continuation bit (0 if no more elements); - pad before each element. This prevents a variable number of missing bits packing into a byte; - strings and byte-arrays; - simply use null-terminated st",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14396:1109,safe,safe,1109,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14396,1,['safe'],['safe']

Safety,"lier PR are responded to there and addressed in the code for this one. This PR is to enable `hail-az/https` Azure file references to contain SAS tokens to enable bearer-auth style file access to Azure storage. Basic summary of the changes:; - Update `AzureAsyncFS` url parsing function to look for and separate out a SAS-token-like query string. Note: made fairly specific to SAS tokens - generic detection of query string syntax interferes with glob support and '?' characters in file names; - Added `generate_sas_token` convenience function to `AzureAsyncFS`. Adds new azure-mgmt-storage package requirement.; - Updated `AzureAsyncFS` to use `(account, container, credential)` tuple as internal `BlobServiceClient` cache key; - Updated `AzureAsyncFSURL` and `AzureFileListEntry` to track the token separately from the name, and extend the base classes to allow returning url with or without a token; - Update `RouterFS.ls` function and associated listfiles function to allow for trailing query strings during path traversal; - Update `AsyncFS.open_from` function to handle query-string urls in zero-length case; - Change to existing behavior: `LocalAsyncFSURL.__str__` no longer returns 'file:' prefix. Done to make `str()` output be appropriate for input to `fs` functions across all subclasses; - Updated `InputResource` to not include the SAS token as part of the destination file name; - Updated `inter_cloud/test_fs.py` to generically use query-string-friendly file path building functions to respect the new model, where it is no longer safe to extend URLs by just appending new segments with `+ ""/""` because there may be a query string, and added `'sas/azure-https'` test case to the fixture. Running tests for the SAS case requires some new test variables to allow the test code to generate SAS tokens (`build.yaml/test_hail_python_fs`):; ```; # Required for SAS testing on Azure; export HAIL_TEST_AZURE_RESGRP=haildev; export HAIL_TEST_AZURE_SUBID=12ab51c6-da79-4a99-8dec-3d2decc97343; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13140:1737,safe,safe,1737,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13140,1,['safe'],['safe']

Safety,"llback will return immediately. The callback is pushed on to the event-loop stack, and on each tick, is checked to determine whether it has returned or not. Blocking operations within the callbacks will block the event loop. This is how CPU viruses, like blockchain manage to slow down web pages that are hijacked to include some mining script: hashing something 30 million times, takes a long time, and JS cannot do anything besides waiting for those operations to finish in a synchronous fashion. Luckily, asynchronous functions are the norm in the JS ecosystem, such that both in the browser, and nodejs, IO functions are (mostly?) asynchronous.; * For NodeJS: Transparently to the user, blocking operations (IO) are executed from kernel threads that Node maintains in the background, effectively making these operations non-blocking (until the thread pool is exhausted). Browsers and NodeJS use different event loops:. NodeJS: libuv event loop; * Node maintains a hidden worker thread pool (kernel threads) through which it issues sys calls, to avoid blocking the event loop. Web: depends on the underlying Javascript Engine; * Chromium: V8: libevent: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25750884/are-there-significant-differences-between-the-chrome-browser-event-loop-versus-t; * Firefox: Spidermonkey: ?; * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop#Event_loop. #### Using callbacks; ```js. # Callback-based; function asyncCall(arg, cb => {; const (err, result) = someSynchronousOperation();. cb(err, result);; }. asyncCall(arg,(r, err) => { if(err){ throw new Error(err); doSomething(r)} ); ```. #### Using async/await; Deeply nested callbacks are hard to follow. This is called ""callback hell"". To help combat this, JS, in both NodeJS and Web context, developed Promises.

We've also discussed plans for implementing join points as a feature in the IR. ### Notable examples:. * Implementation of `whileLoop` (emits bytecode identical to current version):; ```scala; def whileLoop(cond: Code[Boolean], body: Code[Unit]): Code[Unit] =; JoinPoint.CallCC[Unit] { (jb, break) =>; val continue = jb.joinPoint(); val loopBody = jb.joinPoint(); continue.define { _ => JoinPoint.mux(cond, loopBody, break) }; loopBody.define { _ => Code(body, continue(())) }; continue(()); }; ```. * Mutual recursion:; ```scala; def parity(; n: Code[Int],; even: Code[Ctrl],; odd: Code[Ctrl]; ): Code[Ctrl] = {; val isEven = jb.joinPoint[Code[Int]](mb); val isOdd = jb.joinPoint[Code[Int]](mb); isEven.define { i => (i ceq 0).mux(even, isOdd(i - 1)) }; isOdd.define { i => (i ceq 0).mux(odd, isEven(i - 1)) }; isEven(n); }; ```. ### Classes of interest (tl;dr). - `JoinPoint` - Non-returning function. Used to implement control flow in a type-safe, functional way.; - `ParameterPack` - Trait used for tuple deforesting. Allows join-points to be provided multiple; arguments.; - `JoinPointBuilder` - Used to define new join points.; - `CallCC` - Entry-point for expressions with complex control flow. Provides a `JoinPointBuilder`; and a `JoinPoint` to return a value from the expression. ### `JoinPoint`. A `JoinPoint[A]` acts like a non-returning function with an argument of type `A`. The type of an; applied join point is `Code[Ctrl]`, which indicates that this code does some sort of control flow; (like a jump, or a loop), instead of returning a value. Under the hood, `JoinPoint`s are implemented; with a label and a `GOTO` instruction. ```scala; def example1(j: JoinPoint[Code[Int]]): Code[Ctrl] = Code(; j(3),; ""this line is never reached"".println,; j(4)); ```. ### `ParameterPack`. The trait `ParameterPack[A]` says that the type `A` is comprised of a list of `Code[T]`s, such that the structure of that list is statically k",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7055:1512,safe,safe,1512,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7055,1,['safe'],['safe']

Safety,"nes that need to change with `# FIXME:; mTLS`. ### Batch Confused Deputy. The [confused deputy; problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem) is a classic; in computer security. It refers to a situation with two parties: the deputy and; the attacker. The deputy has authority that the attacker does not. For example,; the deputy can arrest people. A *confused deputy* is one which has been tricked; by the attacker into misusing its authority. In master, Batch has a confused deputy problem: it issues a callback in response; to a batch finishing. That callback is issued from within the cluster and; therefore can name many of our services which are not exposed to the; internet. With the introduction of TLS everywhere, a confused deputy callback; will fail because the victim will not receive a valid Batch certificate (batch; purposely does not send certificates with the callbacks). Batch only uses its; certificate to send a callback for CI. This is safe because we control CI and; ensure it is not compromised. In the long run, I want to fix batch to use an entirely different network for; callbacks. ### Notes of Annoyance. `aiohttp` silently ignores most invalid TLS requests, this makes debugging a TLS; issue difficult. `aiohttp`'s `raise_for_status` does not include the HTTP body in the; message. NGINX sometimes returns 400 in response to TLS issues with a proxy. It; includes crucial details in the HTTP body. I usually debug these issues by; sshing to the client pod and using curl to manually reproduce the error. Readiness and liveness probes cannot use HTTP. Although k8s supports HTTPS, it; does not support so-called ""mTLS"" or ""mutual TLS."" This is fancy verbiage for; servers that require clients to send trusted certificates. I will eventually require; this. There is a lot of information in GitHub issues and the Istio web pages; about this, but at the end of the day, kubernetes does not support this.

Safety,"nginx can use more than one core and at max load + PRs we're maxing out internal-gateway cycles, which add latency, timeouts, retries, and generally degrade the experience in one namespace based on activity in others. Allowing nginx to use more cores (in this case this is up to half our node size) got our system back into its intended state with graceful throttling. I'll admit, other than being half a node size, 4 is a bit arbitrary here.

Auth ; Authentication is tricky, but not for any reason specific to React, Next, Node. Server-side rendered apps tie the web app to the resource server; as such it's easier to hide sensitive information. . Mobile and desktop apps have dealt with this for 2 decades. We should build a robust infrastructure, and not one that requires server-rendered web pages for security. Currently it seems Auth0 may not be the best choice: it does not interface for us with third-party API's; requires us to either insecurely store 3rd party access tokens (with at least 1 extra round trip), or altogether proxy all third-party requests through our own resource server... Firebase Auth seems to avoid these limitations. ## TODO:; 1. Create a structured description of this pull request; 2.

Safety,"olders whose names match but either differ in size or differ in type. Four columns: source URL, destination URL, source state, destination state. The states are either: `file`, `dif`, or a size. If either state is a size, both states are sizes. 3. `srconly` files only present in the source. One column: source URL. 4. `dstonly` files only present in the destination. One column: destination URL. 5. `plan` a proposed set of object-to-object copies. Two columns: source URL, destination URL. 6. `summary` a one-line file containing the total number of copies in plan and the total number of bytes which would be copied. As described in the CLI documentation, the intended use of these commands is:. ```; hailctl fs sync --make-plan plan1 --copy-to gs://gcs-bucket/a s3://s3-bucket/b; hailctl fs sync --use-plan plan1; ```. The first command generates a plan folder and the second command executes the plan. Separating this process into two commands allows the user to verify what exactly will be copied including the exact destination URLs. Moreover, if `hailctl fs sync --use-plan` fails, the user can re-run `hailctl fs sync --make-plan` to generate a new plan which will avoid copying already successfully copied files. Moreover, the user can re-run `hailctl fs sync --make-plan` to verify that every file was indeed successfully copied. Testing. This change has a few sync-specific tests but largely reuses the tests for `hailtop.aiotools.copy`. Future Work. Propagating a consistent kind of hash across all clouds and using that for detecting differences is a better solution than the file-size based difference used here. If all the clouds always provided the same type of hash value, this would be trivial to add. Alas, at time of writing, S3 and Google both support CRC32C for every blob (though, in S3, you must explicitly request it at object creation time), but *Azure Blob Storage does not*. ABS only supports MD5 sums which Google does not support for multi-part uploads.

I had to ship the arrays of filtered variant indices to the workers somehow, so I shipped them as base64 encoded arrays of bytes. It's pretty groady (and that's why I added the commons-codec library). I don't know how else to initialize record readers with hadoop. Generally, I think the BGEN loading code could use a clean up, and I haven't done that here, if anything I've made it more complicated. I also need to check that there are tests for or write tests for:. - indexing tables doesn't cause an extra shuffle; - ~the include lid and include raid flags~ included in #3779; - the variant list flag; - `getSplits`; - the variant filtering code; - ~loading a bgen with no entries~ exists: `BGENTests.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3727:2608,unsafe,unsafeAdvance,2608,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3727,1,['unsafe'],['unsafeAdvance']
Safety,"r. I think this is currently impossible due to lack of permissions, but we should either explicitly prohibit this or ensure our solution encompasses it. In particular, I am concerned OpenID could be used to grant permission for a GCP identity to write to S3 or ABS. . Pulling an image shouldn뗪 trigger substantial egress. In the first case, there are three kinds of possible egress:; 1. Egress to the Public Internet.; 2. Egress to a VM in a different Google region.; 3. Egress to a Google Service in a different Google region (e.g. uploading to a bucket in a different region). I believe (2) and (3) are charged equivalently. (1) is simply Internet egress pricing. In (3), I뗤 not sure who pays the egress from a VM to a bucket in a different region. I assume the VM owner. In all three cases, the destination뗩 location matters. For public Internet egress, we can use GeoIP to determine the region of the planet. I뗤 not sure if we can determine the region of (2) and (3). If we can뗪, we should either prevent such traffic or we should charge the maximum egress. A final caveat is that we use Premium Networking. As a result, our traffic can use Google뗩 internal backbone. It뗩 not clear to me if this means that a packet from us-central to a public IP in Australia incurs just Internet egress or that *and* a region-to-region egress to pay for the use of GCP뗩 internal global backbone. The priority of various considerations:; 1. Top priority within this issue is to track and recover costs. Even if this means charging a flat fee across all possible kinds of egress. Even if that fee is substantially higher than the real cost to us.; 2. Second priority is to surface this information to the user. Simply providing, in the job page, the usage and cost of each resource for this job.; 3. Fine grained egress so that users can actually intentionally use it at cost or near cost to, for example, move data between clouds or regions. . ### Version. 0.2.120. ### Relevant log output. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13428:1907,recover,recover,1907,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13428,1,['recover'],['recover']

Safety,"re are two ordering operations in hail: `Table.order_by`, and `MatrixTable.choose_cols`. Of the three keying operations, only `Table.key_by` and `MatrixTable.key_rows_by` enforce ordering. The ordering of the columns of a matrix table has no relationship to the keys of the columns of a MatrixTable. **NB**: when a table is created from the columns of a matrix table (`MatrixTable.cols`), the table is sorted by the keys (there exists an implicit `Table.key_by`). Moreover, we guarantee and document (in `MatrixTable.cols`) that when the matrix table has a zero-length column key, the table's ordering is given by matrix table columns' ordering. According to ""Ordering and keys in relational objects"", all sorts (whether triggered by an order_by or a key_by) are unstable. A common user operation is to export or collect a field of a relational object. Sometimes users do not want the keys of an expression exported or collected. In this situation, the user requires that the data is sorted in a sensible way (otherwise they cannot recover which item came from which key). Hail internally guarantees (but does not guarantee to our users or document) that localizing operations (take, collect, and show) and `export` produce data in the ordering of the relational object. For example:. ```; In [38]: t = hl.utils.range_table(3) ; ...: t = t.order_by(-t.idx).show() ; +-------+; | idx |; +-------+; | int32 |; +-------+; | 2 |; | 1 |; | 0 |; +-------+; ```. # Ordering and Library Developers. On occasion, a user may have a table of unknown ordering and keying. For example, the implementor of `Expression.collect` (e.g. `mt.GT.collect()`). In this situation, it is desirable to be able to remove keys without modifying the order. In particular, the values should appear in the same order that they appear in the relational object (for a table, in the order of the rows; for a matrix table, ordered first by the row and then by the column). For example, the multiplication table for 0 to 2:. ```; In [39",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/6929:1312,recover,recover,1312,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/6929,1,['recover'],['recover']

When we choose the length of a random sequence, we choose it using the [Beta-Binomial Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-binomial_distribution) with `n` set to the maximum sequence size (usually the Gen's `size`), 풤 set to `3` and  set to `6 * ln(n + 0.01)`. My choice of  is motivated by keeping the mass away from `0` when `n` is small. In particular, I'd like the mean to be greater than or equal to one, so `n풤/(풤+) >= 1` so for, say, n=4, `/풤 <= 3`.

Safety,"s. If you have an Apple M1 or Apple M2 and `/usr/libexec/java_home -V` does not include `(arm64)`, you must switch to an arm64 version of the JVM. Fixes (hail#14000). Fixes #14000. Hail has never supported its native functionality on Mac OS X Apple M1 chips. In particular, we only built x86_64 compatible dylibs. M1 chips will try to simulate a very basic x86_64 ISA using Rosetta 2 but our x86_64 dylibs expect the ISA of at least sandybridge, which includes some SIMD instructions not supported by Rosetta 2. This PR bifurcates our native build into x86_64 and arm64 targets which live in build/x86_64 and build/arm64, respectively. In Linux, this moves where the object files live, but should otherwise have no effect. The test and benchmark targets use the ""native"" build which always points at the x86_64 object files. The shared object targets, LIBBOOT & LIBHAIL, explicitly depend on x86_64 because that is the only linux architecture we support. In OS X, we only test and benchmark the ""native"" build, which is detected using `uname -m`. For the shared objects (the dylibs) we have four new files: libboot and libbhail for x86_64 and for arm64. Each pair files is placed in `darwin/x86_64/` and `darwin/arm64/`, respectively. Those dylibs are never meant to escape the src/main/c world. The LIBBOOT and LIBHAIL targets (which are invoked by hail/Makefile) combine the two architecture-specific dylibs into a ""universal"" dylib. You can verify this by running `file` on the dylibs.

Safety,"s`: this parameter now defaults to `True` and includes the; response body text in the error message. Both; Both parameters may be overridden on a per-request basis. - `httpx.ResponseManager` and `httpx.ClientSession` work together to enable; `retry_transient` and `raise_for_status`. Aiohttp has this unusual structure where; all the request methods are synchronous but they return an object that is both; awaitable and an async context manager. I mirror their structure exactly. The; `httpx.ResponseManager` is both awaitable and an async context manager. Its; `response_coroutine` field is a coroutine that includes the retry and; raise-for-status logic. - The `HailResolver` overrides domain name resolution to first consult the Hail; `address` service. `address` is effectively a domain name server. It watches; kubernetes services and publishes the pod IPs. It supports two name styles:; `service` and `service.namespace`. The former uses the deploy config to; determine in which namespace to find the given service. Currently, the; client-side library only looks up IPs for `shuffler` and `address`. - `BlockingClientSession` and `BlockingContextManager` wrap the; aforementioned `httpx` classes. `BlockingClientResponse` wraps an; `aiohttp.ClientResponse`. ---. Examples of correct usage:. A blocking HTTPS request:. ```python3; with httpx.blocking_client_session() as session:; with session.post(url, json=config, headers=headers) as resp:; assert resp.status == 200; print(resp.text()); ```. An asynchronous HTTPS request to auth:; ```python3; async with httpx.client_session() as session:; async with session.get(; deploy_config.url('auth', '/api/v1alpha/userinfo'),; headers=headers) as resp:; assert resp.status == 200; print(await resp.json()); ```. A blocking HTTPS session with a large default timeout:. ```python3; httpx.blocking_client_session(; headers=service_auth_headers(deploy_config, 'query'),; timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=600)); ```. cc: @catoverdrive @Dania-Abuhijleh",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9554:3254,timeout,timeout,3254,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9554,2,['timeout'],['timeout']

Safety,"tervalFilters. Instead of matching against very specific patterns, and failing completely for things that don't quite match (e.g. an input is let bound, or the fold implementing ""locus is contained in a set of intervals"" is written slightly differently), this uses a standard abstract interpretation framework, which is almost completely insensitive to the form of the IR, only depending on the semantics. It also correctly handles missing key fields, where the previous implementation often produced an unsound transformation of the IR. Also adds a much more thorough test suite than we had before. At the top level, the analysis takes a boolean typed IR `cond` in an environment where there is a reference to some `key`, and produces a set `intervals`, such that `cond` is equivalent to `cond & intervals.contains(key)` (in other words `cond` implies `intervals.contains(key)`, or `intervals` contains all rows where `cond` is true). This means for instance it is safe to replace `TableFilter(t, cond)` with `TableFilter(TableFilterIntervals(t, intervals), cond)`. Then in a second pass it rewrites `cond` to `cond2`, such that `cond & (intervals.contains(key))` is equivalent to `cond2 & intervals.contains(key)` (in other words `cond` implies `cond2`, and `cond2 & intervals.contains(key)` implies `cond`). This means it is safe to replace the `TableFilter(t, cond)` with `TableFilter(TableFilterIntervals(t, intervals), cond2)`. A common example is when `cond` can be completely captured by the interval filter, i.e. `cond` is equivant to `intervals.contains(key)`, in which case we can take `cond2 = True`, and the `TableFilter` can be optimized away. This all happens in the function; ```scala; def extractPartitionFilters(ctx: ExecuteContext, cond: IR, ref: Ref, key: IndexedSeq[String]): Option[(IR, IndexedSeq[Interval])] = {; if (key.isEmpty) None; else {; val extract = new ExtractIntervalFilters(ctx, ref.typ.asInstanceOf[TStruct].typeAfterSelectNames(key)); val trueSet = extract.analyze",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13355:1094,safe,safe,1094,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13355,1,['safe'],['safe']

Safety,"the entire output in memory which is likely to cause OOMs. For reasons that are not entirely clear to me, sometimes these OOMs get muffled by our system and instead lead to non-termination. I vaguely remember this happening before with `using`. I suspect there is something somewhat subtle wrong with that method, but I am not certain. Anyway, there are two big changes here:; 1. Do not buffer the entire request body in memory when writing to memory.; 2. Because of (1) we have to pull retry behavior all the way up to the top-level where we know how to recreate the body.; 3. Because of (2) it is easier to provide a `write(url)(writerFunction)` style API, which I do here.; 4. Again, because of (2), and because I want to preserve the file-object-like interface, I added a somewhat funky anonymous class which uses a second thread to facilitate the movement of data written into the OutputStream returned by `create` into the OutputStream of the HTTP connection. Point (4) probably bears more explanation. The root issue is the bad Apache HTTP Client interface. Instead of `request` returning an OutputStream, it takes an ""entity"". An entity knows how to write itself into the OutputStream of an HTTP request. This works fine if the ""writer"" code is pased as a function (as in my new `write` method), but that does not work if the control flow looks like:. f = create(...); f.write(...); r.close(). We avoid this limited API by initiating the request in a second thread which will eventually block waiting to receive data from a PipedInputStream. That PipedInputStream produces the data written to a PipedOutputStream. The `create` call returns a positioned OutputStream which just writes data into the PipedOutputStream and handles cleaning up the thread when it is closed. In a multi-core system, network requests should proceed in parallel to the client code. In a single-core system, the written data will buffer until `close` is called which will definitely yield control to the other thread.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12689:1442,avoid,avoid,1442,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12689,2,['avoid'],['avoid']

Use a `SafeRow` to copy the globals data out of a Region and into durable, GC'ed objects. 3. Re-enable serialization of GoogleStorageFS (including its private key, which we really shouldn't; do; Tim is working on it), which was broken (presumably) when we changed Scala versions. The; `var` modifier ensures the name is compiled as a JVM field. 4. Correctly convert from a `Byte` to an `Int`. By default `Byte` to `Int` conversion (which is done; automatically when you return a `Byte` from a function whose return type is `Int`) is; sign-preserving. That means that the byte `0000 1111` is converted to the `Int` 15 and the byte; `1000 1111` is converted to the `Int` -113. The contract of; [`InputStream.read`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html#read--); is to return the unsigned integeral value of the next `Byte` or `-1` if we've reached the end of; the stream. `DataInputStream` treats any negative value as EOS which lead to perplexing EOSes; when reading data from GCS. 5.

Safety,"ure storage. Basic summary of the changes:; 	- Update `AzureAsyncFS` url parsing function to look for and separate out a SAS-token-like query string. Note: made fairly specific to SAS tokens - generic detection of query string syntax interferes with glob support and '?' characters in file names; 	- Added `generate_sas_token` convenience function to `AzureAsyncFS`. Adds new `azure-mgmt-storage` package requirement.; 	- Updated `AzureAsyncFS` to use `(account, credential)` tuple as internal `BlobServiceClient` cache key; 	- Updated `AzureAsyncFSURL` and `AzureFileListEntry` to track the token separately from the name, and extend the base classes to allow returning url with or without a token ; 	- Update `RouterFS.ls` function and associated `listfiles` function to allow for trailing query strings during path traversal ; 	- Change to existing behavior: `LocalAsyncFSURL.__str__`no longer returns 'file:' prefix. Done to make `str()` output be appropriate for input to `fs` functions across all subclasses; 	- Updated `inter_cloud/test_fs.py` to generically use query-string-friendly file path building functions; - Updated InputResource to not include the SAS token as part of the destination file name . `test_fs.py` has been updated to respect the new model, where it is no longer safe to extend URLs by just appending new segments with + ""/"" because there may be a query string. But actually running those tests for the SAS case will require some new test variables to allow the test code to generate SAS tokens (`build.yaml/test_hail_python_fs`): ; ```; export HAIL_TEST_AZURE_ACCOUNT=hailtest; export HAIL_TEST_AZURE_CONTAINER=hail-test-4nxei; # Required for SAS testing on Azure; export HAIL_TEST_AZURE_RESGRP=hailms02; export HAIL_TEST_AZURE_SUBID=12ab51c6-da79-4a99-8dec-3d2decc97343; ```; So the SAS case is disabled for now (`test_fs.py`):; ```; @pytest.fixture(params=['file', 'gs', 's3', 'hail-az', 'router/file', 'router/gs', 'router/s3', 'router/hail-az']) # 'sas/hail-az'; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12877:1407,safe,safe,1407,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12877,1,['safe'],['safe']

Safety,"ved the code). - `.strip()` the GitHub token in case there are newlines. - print the SHA being deployed in the log statement. - add `hail-ci-build.sh` to CI, which just invokes `make test-in-cluster`(which in turn runs `test-in-cluster.sh`. - `test-in-cluster.sh` copies the secrets for testing to the expected locations and exposes the pod in which it is running with an internal service, recent changes to `site` [redirect sub URLs of ci.test.is to services named using this scheme](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/master/site/hail.nginx.conf#L38-L41). GitHub uses these URLs to send updates to the CI under test about the watched repositories. - `test-locally.sh` now installs `../batch` into the currently running `pip` before testing (NB: if you edit batch and run the tests without committing the changes you've made to batch, this will pass tests but fail when pushed to a PR!). - `test-locally.sh` activates the `hail-ci` conda environment itself because it was not being propagated from the `Makefile`. I don't know why, but this is a simple fix. - `test-locally.sh` starts the ci after the repository is created. CI will print error messages if a watched repository doesn't exist. - `test/test-ci.py` now uses access tokens for all interaction with GitHub, previously it relied on the latent privileges that I and Cotton had in our environments. - `test/test-ci.py` uses a temporary, but not automatically deleted, directory when the environment variable `IN_CLUSTER` is set to `true` (to which it is set by `test-in-cluster.sh`). I noticed that, when running in a batch job pod, if an error occurred, `pytest` failed to print any error information and instead failed because the current working directory no longer existed. I found very little information on Google about this. It seems safe to not clean up temporary directories created in the batch job pod because pods are ephemeral. cc: @cseed.

Safety,"y jobs from the database to schedule on available workers; 2. Compute placement of a subset of the jobs in available slots in the worker pool; 3. Concurrently call `/api/v1alpha/batches/jobs/create` on available workers for each placed job. If/when the request completes successfully, the job is marked as scheduled.; 4. Once all requests complete, goto 1. On the worker, what happens inside `/api/v1alpha/batches/jobs/create`:; 1. Read metadata describing the job to schedule from the request body; 2. Using that information, load the full job spec from blob storage; 3. Spawn a task to run the job asynchronously; 4. Respond to the driver with a 200. The key point relevant to this issue is that the driver currently must wait for all the requests to workers in an iteration to complete before it starts the next iteration of the scheduler. This leaves the scheduler vulnerable to problematic workers or workers that happen to be preempted during the scheduling process. So, the driver sets a [2 second timeout](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/b27737f67bf9e69f1abed2fec07fc7c921790ef8/batch/batch/driver/job.py#L585) on the call to `/api/v1alpha/batches/jobs/create`. Additionally, this general design means that in the event of a request timeout or transient error, Batch cannot guarantee that there is always at most one concurrent running attempt for a given job. This ends up being a fine (and intentional) concession in practice because the idempotent design of preemptible jobs tends to cover this scenario, but it is regardless wasted compute and cost to users. Nevertheless, we strive to minimize cases where we might halt the scheduling loop or double-schedule work, and one way to do that in the current design is to minimize the variance in latency of `/api/v1alpha/batches/jobs/create`. The largest source of this latency is the request to blob storage. While GCS and ABS are relatively fast and highly available, Batch in Azure Terra requires first obtaining SAS tokens from the Te",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14456:1173,timeout,timeout,1173,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14456,1,['timeout'],['timeout']
Safety,"y keyed by locus, and removed the MatrixKeyRowsBy in combine_gvcfs. To goal here is to avoid re-buidling an re-broadcasting the partitioner once for each gVCF. We'll need to re-key at the very end. I'm not so familiar with the end of the joint calling pipeline. @chrisvittal can you take care of that?. Second, I don't repartition in TableMultiWayZipJoin if the partitioners all match (which they should in in the joint calling pipeline). For that to work right, I need allowedOverlap == 0 (or to verify the partitions are in fact disjoint). Turns out allowedOverlap wasn't being propagated in various places. I fixed that. @patrick-schultz can you look at the RVDPartitioner changes? They just look like oversights to me, but maybe there was a reason why, for example, copy and coarsen wasn't preserving allowedOverlap?. Finally, now the joint calling pipeline/test_combiner_works segfaults, ugh:. ```; $ hail -m unittest test.hail.methods.test_impex.VCFTests.test_combiner_works; #; # A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:; #; # SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x000000010e5fa090, pid=64905, tid=33795; #; # JRE version: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (8.0_45-b14) (build 1.8.0_45-b14); # Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (25.45-b02 mixed mode bsd-amd64 compressed oops); # Problematic frame:; # J 8877 C1 is.hail.expr.types.physical.PLocus$$anon$1.compare(Lis/hail/annotations/Region;JLis/hail/annotations/Region;J)I (117 bytes) @ 0x000000010e5fa090 [0x000000010e5f9de0+0x2b0]; #; ```. The rest of the tests pass (the other Python failures are cascaded failures from test_combiner_works, I double-checked in the hopes of finding an easier example to debug.) It is pretty clearly related to the no repartition optimization. If I disable it, test_combiner_works passes.

Safety,"~Stacked on #10770~; ~Stacked on #10791~. This PR attempts to allow linear algebra codegen methods, like the LAPACK wrappers and the local whitening methods I'm working on, to defensively assert shape compatibility preconditions, without generating redundant runtime checks. (I always hate when we're pushed to avoid using code generation abstractions (in this case, just factoring code into smaller functions), because they generate worse code.). The method is pretty simple. SNDArray shapes are now arrays of `SizeValue`, which is a sum type with cases `SizeValueDyn(Value[Long])` and `SizeValueStatic(Long)`. I don't think static sizes occur very often, but it was a simple addition. `SizeValue`s can be compared statically with `==`, or at runtime with `ceq`: the former is true only if we can prove statically that the two sizes must be equal, while the latter emits code to check equality at runtime, using static knowledge to elide dynamic checks where possible. The way we encode static knowledge that two sizes are equal is by using the same local variable to store both. The primary interface to introduce that static knowledge (other than using the same set of sizes to construct multiple SNDArrays), is the method `coerceToShape(cb: CodeBuilder, newShape: Seq[SizeValue]): SNDArrayValue`, which emits code to dynamically assert that `this.shape` agrees with `newShape`, then returns `this` with shape replaced by `newShape`. Thus, `a.coerceToShape(cb, newShape).shape == newShape` will always be true, preserving the static knowledge about the shape of `a`. As a simple example, `gemm` verifies its inputs with (simplifying to the case with no transposes); ```; val Seq(m, n) = C.shapes; val k = A.shapes(1); A.assertHasShape(cb, FastIndexedSeq(m, k), errMsg); B.assertHasShape(cb, FastIndexedSeq(k, n), errMsg); ```; If we call this with; ```; val m, n, k = \\ compute expected dim sizes. \\ emit dynamic size checks once; val A_ = A.coerceToShape(cb, IndexedSeq(m, k)); val B_ = B.coerce",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/10783:249,redund,redundant,249,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/10783,2,"['avoid', 'redund']","['avoid', 'redundant']"

If you would like, I can try to disentangle them. Here are the conceptual changes:; * add a CodeBuilder argument to `getEmitParam`, so that parameters which are pointers to region values can be loaded into `SValue`s with multiple locals; * make `EmitValue` a concrete class, consisting of an optional boolean value and an `SValue`; * add `valueTuple` to both `SValue` and `EmitValue`; * copy the `SCode` interface onto `SValue`, to make it easier to replace `SCode`s with `SValues` ; * add `loadToSValue` to `SingleCodeType`; * add `SStreamValue`.

Safety,"~~Stacked on #9320~~. Use the framework introduced in #9320 to make the IR parser stack safe. This touches a lot of lines, but it is a completely mechanical refactoring. I did some preliminary benchmarking by timing the parse of the IR in `test_ld_prune`. (I chose that test fairly arbitrarily, and we can probably find better test cases, or generate synthetic large IRs.) Running a loop parsing the same IR repeatedly, with 10 burn-in rounds, and 60 timed rounds, I got the following results:; * On main; ```; quartiles = [4.55816, 5.209579, 5.647135]; avg = 5.332496950000001, std = 1.13761574944604; ```; * Using `StackSafe`, without the optimization in `repUntil`; ```; quantiles = [4.610798, 5.09793, 7.159075]; avg = 5.7519015000000016, std = 1.612397075594852; ```; * Using `StackSafe, with the optimization which reuses the `cont` closure, instead of allocating a new one for each token.; ```; quantiles = [4.466849, 4.826873, 5.719238]; avg = 5.2787357833333335, std = 1.272006325411254; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9332:88,safe,safe,88,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9332,1,['safe'],['safe']

Security," (oh the irony). The major new build step is `create_certs` which creates a certificate, key, and; list of trusted ""principals"" for each ""principal"". ""Principal"" is a computer; security term referring to an authenticatable identity. In our system, the; services are each unique principals and every client (e.g. the test_batch CI; step) is also a principal. A principal's certificate is a unforgeable proof of; their identity. A principal's ""key"", in our system, is actually a public-private; (i.e. asymmetric) key pair which the client and server use to establish a; symmetric key for each new connection. A list of trusted principals is a list of; certificates. Every incoming connection must provide a certificate in the; trusted list or the server will drop the connection. Every service depends on the `create_certs` step because their deployment's load; secrets created by `create_certs`. The blog service is implemented by Ghost. Ghost only supports HTTP. As a result; we cannot make all network traffic in our cluster TLS-secured. However, we can; use an nginx sidecar on the blog pod which terminates TLS connections and sends; plaintext traffic on the loopback interface to Ghost. Thus, our goal is: no; plaintext traffic on non-loopback interfaces. Readiness and liveness probes cannot use HTTP. Although k8s supports HTTPS, it; does not support so-called ""mTLS"" or ""mutual TLS."" This is fancy verbiage for; servers that require clients to send trusted certificates. We require; this. There is a lot of information in GitHub issues and the Istio web pages; about this, but at the end of the day, kubernetes does not support this. TCP; probes are the best we can do.

Security," Security. Preceded by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) which; is not obsolete and insecure. After SSL version 3, a new version of SSL was; proposed in RFC 2246. This new version was backwards-incompatible and was; thus given a new name: Transport Layer Security. In common discussion, SSL; and TLS are used interchangeable. Indeed, the python TLS library is called; `ssl`. [2] Forward secrecy is a property of an encryption system. Forward secrecy means; a message cannot be decrypted in the future by an adversary who learned one; of the private keys. For example, imagine you are sending sensitive messages; to another individual. If that individual is later coerced into revealing; their secret key, forward secrecy would prevent the coercer from reading; your messages. Forward secrecy is achieved by negotiating a shared private; key between the two parties that is only used for a ""session"" and then; discarded. If the session key is securely discarded and neither key can; recreate it without cooperation from the other key, then *one* leaked key is; insufficient to reveal the messages. ---. Things for you to verify:; - does every service load *its own unqiue* ssl-config secret?; - does every service use an SSL context for serving?; - does everyone who makes http requests to internal services use an SSL client; session?; - do all TLS-secured nginx instances include their http.conf in the `http`; section and the `proxy.conf` file in any proxying sections?; - Do the SSLContext's from `ssl.py` and the nginx configurations generated by; `create_certs.py` actually ensure security?. Post-merge actions:; - deploy gateway; - deploy internal-gateway; - deploy router-resolver. Anticipated outages:. - Before a service is redeployed it will be inaccessible from the outside; because the router will try to speak to it on HTTPS. Services that speak to; one another (ci<->batch, everyone<->auth) will lose connections while the; deploy is happening. Deploy should move smoothly because CI will compl",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8561:12508,secur,securely,12508,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8561,1,['secur'],['securely']

Security," an error since `start` has no option `--beta`. This PR rewrites argument parsing to use click instead of argparse: https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/. Things you need to know about click:; - A group is a group of commands or subgroups, like `hailctl dataproc`, `hailctl batch`, etc. Groups are defined like this:; ; ```; @hailctl.group(; help=""Manage the Hail Batch service.""); def batch():; pass; ```; - A command in a group is defined like this:. ```; @batch.command(; help=""Get a particular batch's info.""); @click.argument('batch_id', type=int); @click.option('--output-format', '-o',; type=click.Choice(['yaml', 'json']),; default='yaml', show_default=True,; help=""Specify output format"",); def get(batch_id, output_format):; ...; ```. The command decorator replaces the function with one that takes a `List[str]` of command line parameters, parses them, and calls the original function. The option options are pretty self-explanatory. - To access an argument to a group (like `dataproc --beta`) in a (sub)command, use the decorator `click.pass_context` to pass the click context which allows you to access parent group parameters. `dataproc start` is an example:. ```; @dataproc.command(; help=""Start a Dataproc cluster configured for Hail.""); @click.argument('cluster_name'); ...; @click.pass_context; def start(ctx, cluster_name, ...):; beta = ctx.parent.params['beta']; ```.

Security," and Java 11, and the minimal supported Java version will be Java 17; > Support for Scala 2.12, and the minimal supported Scala version will be 2.13. Also, requiring specifically Java 8 or 11 has led to some friction for students and researchers who are first evaluating hail. In the past few weeks, I've talked to a lot of students and researchers who wanted to evaluate hail, followed the documentation to install Azul Java 8 but already had an existing Java install and did not update their PATH or JAVA_HOME. Most of their existing Java versions were 17, as 17 is the current default on most Linux distros and a common one to have been installed via Brew in the past few years on Mac. Alternatively, if you don't want to allow Java 17, potentially Hail could bundle a JRE with it in the PyPI distributable? Using jdeps on the Hail shadow jar, I saw that it only needs these modules in a JRE:; ```; java.base,java.compiler,java.desktop,java.management,java.naming,java.rmi,java.scripting,java.security.jgss,java.sql,jdk.httpserver,jdk.unsupported; ```. That means that a JRE created with jlink like this:; ```; jlink --add-modules java.base,java.compiler,java.desktop,java.management,java.naming,java.rmi,java.scripting,java.security.jgss,java.sql,jdk.httpserver,jdk.unsupported --output minimaljre --strip-debug --no-man-pages --no-header-files --compress=2; ```; comes in at under 30MB gzipped, which would increase the PyPI package by about 20% in size, while allowing users to install and run Hail in _any_ supported python environment without having to consider Java versions at all. Alternatively, have you ever considered distributing Hail through conda-forge or bioconda, where you could specify a JRE that should be installed with it and automatically linked?. Is there a better channel than Github Issues for feature requests?

Security," because this PR addresses questions of state and will take care of this. ```python; self.exit_code = pod.status.container_statuses[0].state.terminated.exit_code; ```. We should probably do something like . ```python; self.exit_code = max(status.state.terminated.exit_code for status in pod.status.container_statuses); ```; although I also see that in update_job_with_pod we effectively restrict to a single container. I'm not sure why this limit exists, but if needed, should probably occur during creation. In the upcoming PR, which moves state to MySQL 5.7+, and a different server model (async), I think it would be neat to represent meta-state (across all containers, and potentially the job subgraph whose first node is the inspected job) as:. ```go; const (; 	Cancelled = -3; 	Initialized = -2; 	Created = -1; ); ```. with values >=0 being the maximum of the linux error codes, 0-255, of the subgraph. Simple queries. Alternative is to use NULL when not completed, but when used in a client would require a null check, or potentially have surprising side effects (i.e where the default value is 0). We could also use a separate, text-based status field, but I will store a queryable JSON field containing the full status as well. In a similar vein, we have some state race conditions.

Security," configuration file that configures TLS for; outgoing (proxy_pass) requests.; - `site-key.pem`: a private key.; - `site-cert.pem`: a certificate.; - `site-incoming.pem`: a list of certificates trusted for incoming requests.; - `site-outgoing.pem`: a list of certificates expected from outgoing requests. If site makes an HTTP request to a server and that server does not return a; certificate in `site-outgoing.pem`, it will immediately halt the connection. I; intend (though do not currently) site to also reject incoming requests that are; not accompanied by a certificate in `site-incoming.pem`. I describe the [trouble; with that later](#incoming-trust). There are two other kinds: `json` and `curl`. The former is for Hail Python; services. The later is for the admin-pod and image-fetcher. Deploy will run `create_certs` on every master deploy. Newly deployed services; will be unable to talk to not-yet-deployed services. I include the; one-deploy-ago certificates in the trust chains, but once incoming trust is; fixed, I am unsure how to smoothly upgrade services. I probably need to notify; old services to refresh their certificates after the secrets are updated. ### Incoming Trust. Mutual TLS (mTLS) refers to TLS connections wherein both sides are; authenticated. This is rare on the web. In our system, it means verifying that a; request made to you carries a certificate in the `NAME-incoming.pem` file. I; cannot enable that in this PR because the three unmanaged services,; router-resolver, internal-gateway, and gateway, do not currently have; certificates. As a result, all the services in the PR namespace reject the; requests from the unmangaed services. In particular, batch pods cannot; communicate with batch-driver. After this PR is deployed and the unmanaged services have certificates, I can; enable mutual TLS. I've marked the tow lines that need to change with `# FIXME:; mTLS`. ### Batch Confused Deputy.

Security," in RFC 2246. This new version was backwards-incompatible and was; thus given a new name: Transport Layer Security. In common discussion, SSL; and TLS are used interchangeable. Indeed, the python TLS library is called; `ssl`. [2] Forward secrecy is a property of an encryption system. Forward secrecy means; a message cannot be decrypted in the future by an adversary who learned one; of the private keys. For example, imagine you are sending sensitive messages; to another individual. If that individual is later coerced into revealing; their secret key, forward secrecy would prevent the coercer from reading; your messages. Forward secrecy is achieved by negotiating a shared private; key between the two parties that is only used for a ""session"" and then; discarded. If the session key is securely discarded and neither key can; recreate it without cooperation from the other key, then *one* leaked key is; insufficient to reveal the messages. ---. Things for you to verify:; - does every service load *its own unqiue* ssl-config secret?; - does every service use an SSL context for serving?; - does everyone who makes http requests to internal services use an SSL client; session?; - do all TLS-secured nginx instances include their http.conf in the `http`; section and the `proxy.conf` file in any proxying sections?; - Do the SSLContext's from `ssl.py` and the nginx configurations generated by; `create_certs.py` actually ensure security?. Post-merge actions:; - deploy gateway; - deploy internal-gateway; - deploy router-resolver. Anticipated outages:. - Before a service is redeployed it will be inaccessible from the outside; because the router will try to speak to it on HTTPS. Services that speak to; one another (ci<->batch, everyone<->auth) will lose connections while the; deploy is happening. Deploy should move smoothly because CI will completely; transmit the deploy batch to batch before batch goes dark.; - dev namespaces will be broken until the owner redeploys the router, etc.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8561:12915,secur,secured,12915,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8561,2,['secur'],"['secured', 'security']"

Security," is implemented on TCP/IP. HTTPS is also implemented on TCP/IP and differs; very mildly. After the socket is opened, a TLS [1] connection is established; over the socket. Thereafter, every HTTP message is encrypted and transported by; the TLS machinery. The HTTP protocol is unchanged. The default port fort HTTP is; 80 and the default port for HTTPS 443, however any port may be used. There are currently four versions of TLS, the latest is TLS 1.3. All versions of; SSL are considered insecure. The OpenSSL library implements TLS. There are other implementations, such as; LibreSSL, but they implement roughly the same interface as OpenSSL. The TLS protocol defines both a scheme for the *encryption of messages* and for; the *authentication of parties*. The protocol defines authentication as; optional. In practice, at least one party presents authentication. For example,; public web servers authenticate themselves to clients but clients do not; reciprocate. ### Authentication; #### X.509 Certificates. TLS uses X.509 Certificates for authentication. X.509 is a rather complicated; standard. X.509 Certificates can be serialized in a variety of ways. We use the; Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail (PEM) file format for serialization. PEM is; really simple. A file may contain multiple base64-encoded blobs each with a; header and footer of the form:. ```; -----BEGIN LABEL-----; ...; -----END LABEL-----; ```. where `LABEL` describes the data. We only use two labels: `CERTIFICATE` and; `PRIVATE KEY`. An X.509 Certificate is an unforgeable proof of identity. It usually is paired; with a private key that was used to digitally sign the certificate. In the; security literature, an authenticatable entity is usually called a; *principal*. Each principal should have a unique private key. In our system the; principals are both our services (e.g. `batch`, `batch-driver`) and any; non-serving clients (e.g. `test-batch`, `admin-pod`). A key and certificate are; generated ad nihilum by `openssl r",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8561:2334,Certificate,Certificates,2334,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8561,1,['Certificate'],['Certificates']

Security," migration works is there are 5 phases:; 1. Compute the expected number of attempts to process for format version < 3. ; 2. Divide the search space into chunks of size 100 attempts (empirically determined this was the best chunk size) and randomize the order of the chunks.; 3. Serially process 5000 chunks with only 10 out of the 100 records as a ""burn in period"" to avoid the birthday problem when trying to insert records in parallel.; 4. In parallel, process all the chunks with 10 way parallelism (empirically determined to max CPU for a 4 core db instance); 5. Do an audit of the results to make sure the attempt resources now has the correct number of rows and the billing is within $0.001 per job with the old way and new way of computing the billing. The tolerance of $0.001 was empirically determined. At a threshold of $0.0001, 33/30,000,000 attempts failed. I think this is good enough as there's always going to be rounding errors. I did not do an explicit audit in the code to make sure the other aggregated_*_resources tables did not change. I spot checked this was correct in my test database. To do the complete audit during the actual migration would take more time. I made sure all the inserts were idempotent. Please double check this. The inserts use a temporary table with an isolation level of read committed. The reason for this is because `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` locks the next gap lock if the isolation level is not read committed. Maybe what I did is overkill and it's no longer a problem with the new burn in period. https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-locks-set.html I'd be interested to hear @danking feedback on what the best query here is to allow parallelism.

Security," of sharing the CloudSQL database server. The areas of change are as follows:. ### Generation of the namespace's database-server-config; The current approach in main does a little trick. Since the current `createDatabase` step uses the `database-server-config` from default to generate admin/user sql configs, the CI pipeline creates a dummy database `test-database-instance` to create a `sql-test-instance-admin-config` that inherits the credentials from the production `database-server-config`, and then copies that within the test namespace to `database-server-config`. In this change, since we are creating the server ourselves, we can just replace these with a step that creates a `database-server-config` from scratch, and then uses that for the DB pod. Overall making these changes really gave me the heebie jeebies that the test and dev namespaces have all these credentials to the CloudSQL server. I'm glad this gets rid of that. ### Accessing the database server; We use the DB pod's service DNS name as the `host` so inside Kubernetes this Just Works. The one caveat is the CI pipeline in which we run migrations in batch jobs. Those jobs need a way to reach the DB pod. I achieve this with a NodePort and then use the job's K8s credentials to resolve the node and port that the DB is on. The code I've added to do this resolution feels a bit janky, wouldn't mind some feedback on that. In terms of security, if a user job was able to somehow resolve the address of a test db, they would still not have the credentials to access it, and this is currently also the case with the production database. Nevertheless, this does raise an action item that we should only allow traffic to the k8s and DB subnets for `network=private` jobs, but I think we should make that a separate PR. ### Database creation; In order to test this properly in a dev deploy, I needed to make some changes to `create_database.py`. In main, dev deploys can't create databases. I think they should be able to, and tho",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13030:1010,Access,Accessing,1010,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13030,1,['Access'],['Accessing']

This method calls the instance method `in_region()` to check if the dataset is available in the requested region.; - If `in_region()` determines the desired region is not available for some dataset that otherwise is available in another region, it will raise a warning. If user still tries to call `db.annotate_rows_db()` using a dataset unavailable in their region, then it will get caught by the `_check_availability` instance method in the `DB` class and raise a `ValueError`.; - Started to add documentation to the classes and methods, still a work in progress.

Security," pervasive (but minor) improvements to Hail's I/O infrastructure. We should start with the egregious examples. Consider `AzureStorageFS.createNoCompression`'s [`OutputStream`](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/main/hail/src/main/scala/is/hail/io/fs/AzureStorageFS.scala#L332-L342):; ```scala; val os: PositionedOutputStream = new FSPositionedOutputStream(4 * 1024 * 1024) {; private[this] val client: BlockBlobClient = blockBlobClient; private[this] val blobOutputStream = client.getBlobOutputStream(true). override def flush(): Unit = {; bb.flip(). if (bb.limit() > 0) {; blobOutputStream.write(bb.array(), 0, bb.limit()); }. bb.clear(); }; // ...; }; ```. Notice how we already have a `ByteBuffer` but we convert it to an array and send that to the OutputStream. Instead, we could just use the [`ByteChannel` methods of `BlockBlobClient`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.storage.blob.specialized.blockblobclient?view=azure-java-stable#com-azure-storage-blob-specialized-blockblobclient-openseekablebytechannelwrite(com-azure-storage-blob-options-blockblobseekablebytechannelwriteoptions)). The [read case also supports a channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.storage.blob.specialized.blobclientbase?view=azure-java-stable#com-azure-storage-blob-specialized-blobclientbase-openseekablebytechannelread(com-azure-storage-blob-options-blobseekablebytechannelreadoptions-com-azure-core-util-context)). The next, more complicated problem, is the InputBuffer and OutputBuffer interfaces. These assume their sources/sinks are `java.io.InputStream` and `java.io.OutputStream`. Moreover, they too rely on and expose `Array[Byte]` interfaces (e.g. `readBytesArray` and the implementation of `StreamInputBuffer.readBytes`). Let's start with InputBuffer and the decoders and use decoding of VDS variant matrix tables as our benchmark. ```python3; import hail as hl; hl.init(master='local[1]'); vds = hl.vds.read_vds(...); vds.variant_data._force_count_rows(); ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13840:1832,expose,expose,1832,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13840,1,['expose'],['expose']

Security," speaking to servers with certs they didn't trust. Now everyone trusts everyone. As long as the root key is not leaked this is OK. Only `create_certs` mounts this secret. The key is used to sign every certificate and the cert is included in each principal's incoming and outgoing trust lists. The root certificate and key are never re-created, so our deploys have no downtime and we avoid addressing the rotation problem. I removed all the trust specifications. A later PR will resolve rotation and mTLS. That PR will restore the trust specifications. I didn't change the structure of the secrets (they still have an incoming and outgoing trust list which only contains the root cert) because I need this structure for mTLS anyway. The original PR text follows. ---. ## HTTPS and TLS. HTTP is implemented on TCP/IP. HTTPS is also implemented on TCP/IP and differs; very mildly. After the socket is opened, a TLS [1] connection is established; over the socket. Thereafter, every HTTP message is encrypted and transported by; the TLS machinery. The HTTP protocol is unchanged. The default port fort HTTP is; 80 and the default port for HTTPS 443, however any port may be used. There are currently four versions of TLS, the latest is TLS 1.3. All versions of; SSL are considered insecure. The OpenSSL library implements TLS. There are other implementations, such as; LibreSSL, but they implement roughly the same interface as OpenSSL. The TLS protocol defines both a scheme for the *encryption of messages* and for; the *authentication of parties*. The protocol defines authentication as; optional. In practice, at least one party presents authentication. For example,; public web servers authenticate themselves to clients but clients do not; reciprocate. ### Authentication; #### X.509 Certificates. TLS uses X.509 Certificates for authentication. X.509 is a rather complicated; standard. X.509 Certificates can be serialized in a variety of ways.

Security," tables **by date**. In this PR, I don't try and add the usage to the existing `aggregated_*_resources` tables. I did this to cut down on time and space since we're eventually going to deprecate those tables anyways. Because I don't touch those tables, we don't need to worry about modifying the client code and how the current billing information is calculated. How this migration works is there are 5 phases:; 1. Compute the expected number of attempts to process for format version < 3. ; 2. Divide the search space into chunks of size 100 attempts (empirically determined this was the best chunk size) and randomize the order of the chunks.; 3. Serially process 5000 chunks with only 10 out of the 100 records as a ""burn in period"" to avoid the birthday problem when trying to insert records in parallel.; 4. In parallel, process all the chunks with 10 way parallelism (empirically determined to max CPU for a 4 core db instance); 5. Do an audit of the results to make sure the attempt resources now has the correct number of rows and the billing is within $0.001 per job with the old way and new way of computing the billing. The tolerance of $0.001 was empirically determined. At a threshold of $0.0001, 33/30,000,000 attempts failed. I think this is good enough as there's always going to be rounding errors. I did not do an explicit audit in the code to make sure the other aggregated_*_resources tables did not change. I spot checked this was correct in my test database. To do the complete audit during the actual migration would take more time. I made sure all the inserts were idempotent. Please double check this. The inserts use a temporary table with an isolation level of read committed. The reason for this is because `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` locks the next gap lock if the isolation level is not read committed. Maybe what I did is overkill and it's no longer a problem with the new burn in period. https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-locks-set.html I'd be interested to h",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11990:1672,audit,audit,1672,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11990,1,['audit'],['audit']

[1] TLS: Transport Layer Security. Preceded by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) which; is not obsolete and insecure. After SSL version 3, a new version of SSL was; proposed in RFC 2246. This new version was backwards-incompatible and was; thus given a new name: Transport Layer Security. In common discussion, SSL; and TLS are used interchangeable. Indeed, the python TLS library is called; `ssl`. [2] Forward secrecy is a property of an encryption system. Forward secrecy means; a message cannot be decrypted in the future by an adversary who learned one; of the private keys. For example, imagine you are sending sensitive messages; to another individual. If that individual is later coerced into revealing; their secret key, forward secrecy would prevent the coercer from reading; your messages. Forward secrecy is achieved by negotiating a shared private; key between the two parties that is only used for a ""session"" and then; discarded. If the session key is securely discarded and neither key can; recreate it without cooperation from the other key, then *one* leaked key is; insufficient to reveal the messages. ---.

Security," use two labels: `CERTIFICATE` and; `PRIVATE KEY`. An X.509 Certificate is an unforgeable proof of identity. It usually is paired; with a private key that was used to digitally sign the certificate. In the; security literature, an authenticatable entity is usually called a; *principal*. Each principal should have a unique private key. In our system the; principals are both our services (e.g. `batch`, `batch-driver`) and any; non-serving clients (e.g. `test-batch`, `admin-pod`). A key and certificate are; generated ad nihilum by `openssl req -new`:. ```; openssl req -new \; -x509; -keyout key_file; -out cert_file; -newkey rsa:4096; -nodes; -subj /CN=example.com; -addext subjectAltName = DNS:www.example.com,DNS:foo.com; ```. The first three arguments are self-explanatory. I explain the rest:. - `-newkey rsa:4096`. TLS supports many different kinds of private keys. This; generates a 4096-bit private key.; - `-nodes`. This should be read as ""no DES"". It means that the private key is not; itself encrypted using DES and a password.; - `-subj /CN=example.com`. This certificate is valid for a server whose DNS name; is `example.com`. If ""hostname checking"" is enabled (web browsers always; enable it), then the client will reject the certificate if the hostname used; to open the socket does not match the certificate.; - `-addext subjectAltName = ...`. This specifies additional acceptable hostnames; for the aformentioned hostname check. #### Trust. An X.509 Certificate only proves that the principal has a private key. On the; world wide web, ownership of a particular domain, e.g. `example.com`, is; guaranteed by a Certificate Authority (CA). A Certificate Authority (like; letsencypt or VeriSign) digitally signs the certificate of a user that has; proven they own the domain name mentioned in the certificate (see above; discussion of `CN` and `subjectAltName`).

Our system is simpler. We have no root certificate. Each principal has a; certificate which is given to all the principals to which it might; communicate. ### Encryption. TLS has many encryption schemes. I will focus on encryption using a *symmetric*; key because asymmetric schemes do not enable *forward secrecy* [2]. Under; forward secret schemes, the two parties share a private key unknown to all; adversaries. TLS 1.3 makes forward secrecy mandatory. I intend to eventually; require all our services to refuse to speak anything other than TLS 1.3. The shared private key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages sent over a; socket. This poses a problem: how do two parties who have never met each other; agree on a private key without revealing the key to the public?

GitHub uses these URLs to send updates to the CI under test about the watched repositories. - `test-locally.sh` now installs `../batch` into the currently running `pip` before testing (NB: if you edit batch and run the tests without committing the changes you've made to batch, this will pass tests but fail when pushed to a PR!). - `test-locally.sh` activates the `hail-ci` conda environment itself because it was not being propagated from the `Makefile`. I don't know why, but this is a simple fix. - `test-locally.sh` starts the ci after the repository is created. CI will print error messages if a watched repository doesn't exist. - `test/test-ci.py` now uses access tokens for all interaction with GitHub, previously it relied on the latent privileges that I and Cotton had in our environments. - `test/test-ci.py` uses a temporary, but not automatically deleted, directory when the environment variable `IN_CLUSTER` is set to `true` (to which it is set by `test-in-c",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4474:793,expose,exposes,793,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4474,1,['expose'],['exposes']

Security,"## HTTPS and TLS. HTTP is implemented on TCP/IP. HTTPS is also implemented on TCP/IP and differs; very mildly. After the socket is opened, a TLS [1] connection is established; over the socket. Thereafter, every HTTP message is encrypted and transported by; the TLS machinery. The HTTP protocol is unchanged. The default port fort HTTP is; 80 and the default port for HTTPS 443, however any port may be used. There are currently four versions of TLS, the latest is TLS 1.3. All versions of; SSL are considered insecure. The OpenSSL library implements TLS. There are other implementations, such as; LibreSSL, but they implement roughly the same interface as OpenSSL. The TLS protocol defines both a scheme for the *encryption of messages* and for; the *authentication of parties*. The protocol defines authentication as; optional. In practice, at least one party presents authentication. For example,; public web servers authenticate themselves to clients but clients do not; reciprocate. ### Authentication; #### X.509 Certificates. TLS uses X.509 Certificates for authentication. X.509 is a rather complicated; standard. X.509 Certificates can be serialized in a variety of ways. We use the; Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail (PEM) file format for serialization. PEM is; really simple. A file may contain multiple base64-encoded blobs each with a; header and footer of the form:. ```; -----BEGIN LABEL-----; ...; -----END LABEL-----; ```. where `LABEL` describes the data. We only use two labels: `CERTIFICATE` and; `PRIVATE KEY`. An X.509 Certificate is an unforgeable proof of identity. It usually is paired; with a private key that was used to digitally sign the certificate. In the; security literature, an authenticatable entity is usually called a; *principal*. Each principal should have a unique private key. In our system the; principals are both our services (e.g. `batch`, `batch-driver`) and any; non-serving clients (e.g. `test-batch`, `admin-pod`).

Security,"### Change Description. This change exists as part of larger refactoring work. Herein, I've exchanged; hard-coded contextual strings passed to `ExecutionTimer.time` with implict; contexts, drawing inspiration from scalatest. These contexts are now supplied after entering functions like `Compile` and; `Emit` instead of before (see `ExecuteContext.time`). By sprinking calls to ; `time` throughout the codebase after entering functions, we obtain a nice trace; of the timings with `sourcecode.Enclosing`, minus the previous verbosity. See [1] for more information about what pre-built macros are available. We can; always build our own later. See comments in [pull request id] for example output.; Note that `ExectionTimer.time` still accepts a string to support uses like; `Optimise` and `LoweringPass` where those contexts are provided already.; It is also exception-safe now. This change exposed many similarities between the implementations of query; execution across all three backends. I've stopped short of full unification; which is a greater work, I've instead simplified and moved duplicated result; encoding into the various backend api implementations. More interesting changes are to `ExecuteContext`, which now supports; - `time`, as discussed above; - `local`, a generalisation for temporarily overriding properties of an ; `ExecuteContext` (inspired by [2]). While I've long wanted this for testing,; we were doing some questionable things when reporting timings back to python,; for which locally overriding the `timer` of a `ctx` has been very useful.; We also follow this pattern for local regions.

This produced a large unexpected spend because Archive class objects cost 0.05 USD per GB whereas Standard class objects are free. # Solution.

In Azure, this is called the [Hot tier](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/access-tiers-overview?tabs=azure-portal). A user should be able to explicitly override this setting with an allowlist.

Security,"### What happened?. #13131 Adds the ability for users to authenticate with the hail service using access tokens from their hail identity provider (GCP IAM or Azure AAD) instead of using tokens minted by the hail auth service. It does *not*, however, remove the old form of authentication. There are two actions that must be taken to fully remove the old authentication method:. 1. In #13131, the hail python client attempts to use the new `identity.json` cloud credentials for authentication, but falls back to the old `tokens.json` credentials if present.; 2. The `auth` server still supports the old `/api/v1alpha/login` endpoint. This is unused in the new authentication flow and should ultimately be removed. Removing these old code paths can be done in a two-step process, first with deprecation/warnings (the user need only run `hailctl auth login` to start using the new code paths) and then with removal of the old code paths.

Security,"### What happened?. Batch should expose a job's cloud location to the job. In particular, now that multi-regional buckets charge egress, users needing large numbers of cores will need to manually duplicate their data in multiple regions and then choose the correct data source based on the region in which the job is scheduled. The implementor should consider other options but here is an initial proposal:. 1. Input and output files become dictionaries mapping from location to input/output. (If location is not found in list, job fails).; 2. Main container's file system and environment are populated with information about the location. Implementor should consider whether region, zone, or both should be exposed in GCP.

Security,"### What happened?. Currently, the `ServiceBackend`'s implementation of collect distributed array submits a job group full of worker jobs (1 per partition) and waits for the job group to complete before reading the results of the worker jobs. For small analyses this is fine, but when a query has tens of thousands of partitions it can take time to schedule and complete all of the worker jobs and reading back those results on the driver can become a bottleneck. Below is one possible solution to this problem:. #### Expose log for job completions in a job group. The Query Driver should attempt to read worker job results while the stage is running, but to do this it needs the Batch API to provide an append-only log of completed jobs in a job group that the Query Driver can consume instead of issuing O(jobs) job status requests during each stage. It may be that this is already possible with the current database schema, but can at worst be achieved by creating an indexed column on jobs that contain the spot they completed in in the job group. . Completion of this feature would require:; - Carefully evaluating the Batch data model to determine if there are any database changes necessary to construct an append-only log of job completions in a job group from the state of the database; - If changes are needed, design and implement a batch front end API endpoint to query the log; - (Separately) Add support for streaming the log in the Scala BatchClient and use it to read partition results before the job group completes. ### Version. 0.2.132. ### Relevant log output. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14607:518,Expose,Expose,518,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14607,1,['Expose'],['Expose']

An access token does not need to have the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/appengine.admin` scope to read a blob from GCS. This poses an unnecessary risk if such a token were leaked.

Security,"### What happened?. See [Batch Metadata Server RFC](https://github.com/hail-is/hail-rfcs/blob/main/rfc/0012-keyless-job-auth.rst) for background. The objective of this issue is to fully remove GSA key files from Batch job filesystems, preventing possible exfiltration of long-lived credentials. Each remaining task should get its own issue if there isn't already one. Breakdown of tasks:. - [X] Implement a Batch metadata server and expose it in GCP `DockerJob`s (#14019); - [ ] Add metadata server support for `JVMJob`s aka Query-on-Batch in GCP (#14487); - [ ] Add metadata server support in Azure; - [ ] Deprecate and remove support for key files in `DockerJob`s; - [ ] Deprecate and remove support for key files in `JVMJob`s. This requires dropping support for old versions of hail that depend on the key file (up to and including at least 0.2.130). These steps get us past the security milestone of not exposing GSA key files to jobs and risking exfiltration. We might be able to go even further and get rid of key files entirely, which would reduce our operational burden of securing and rotating them.; - [ ] In GCP, use Service Account Impersonation to have the Batch Worker identity impersonate user GSAs, allowing it to create metadata server access tokens without the key files themselves; - [ ] In Azure, investigate if something like the above is even possible. At time of writing, it does not appear that there is an alternative other than storing credentials or adding users to the VM's metadata server. It is unclear whether this can be done dynamically and with what frequency and feels like not their intended use case. ### Version. 0.2.130. ### Relevant log output. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14486:433,expose,expose,433,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14486,4,"['access', 'expose', 'secur']","['access', 'expose', 'securing', 'security']"

Security,"### What happened?. Since we guarantee a job will run at least once, there are two issues that can happen:. 1. A user can write a pipeline in which two jobs race to write the same file, e.g.; ```; j = b.new_job(); j.command('echo hello > {j.out}'); j.write_output(j.out, ""gs://bucket/final-output""); ```; 2. Or, a clever user can avoid this race with some randomness:; ```; j = b.new_job(); j.command('echo hello gsutil cp - gs://bucket/final-output-$RANDOM'); ```. The former is a really common pattern and a bit of a footgun! The latter is rare (I don't know anyone who does it) and hard to work with: how would you know the output file of the *successful* attempt?. Hail should provide some mechanism for a user to get the list of successful attempts and their outputs. One simple option is to include some kind of seeded randomness which the user can access and to return either the seed or all the draws of the successful attempt for each job in `/jobs` or for the one job in `/job/{job_id}`. For example, consider:. ```; j = b.new_job(); j.command('echo hello gsutil cp - gs://bucket/final-output-$(/hail-random-str)'); ```. Where `/hail-random-str` is a binary we mount into the container that randomly generates numbers seeded by `(batch id, job id, attempt id)`. Hail should use the same randomness to ensure that `write_output` is reliable. We might also want a way to automatically remove the output files of the non-successful (e.g. preempted) attempts. ### Version. 0.2.120. ### Relevant log output. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13502:855,access,access,855,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13502,1,['access'],['access']

This is not the case in Azure, so if a developer wants to run the Azure terraform they have to obtain the `global.tfvars` from myself.

Security,"### What happened?. [SAIGE](https://github.com/weizhouUMICH/SAIGE) and its competitor [REGENIE](https://rgcgithub.github.io/regenie/) are the standard bearers for modern GWAS. Hail should expose SAIGE within the Hail Query language. The interface should roughly match `hl.linear_regression_rows`. A Batch pipeline would serve the needs of Broadies (and, indeed, such a pipeline already exists) but has two downsides:; 1. There is substantial I/O involved in exporting the data from Hail-native formats to SAIGE-compatible formats.; 2. Non-Broadies cannot use this pipeline. Query language support for SAIGE would transform the accessibility of SAIGE by making it usable at scale by anyone with access to Hail, which is basically anyone with a large dataset (e.g. [DNANexus](https://med.stanford.edu/gbsc/projects/vapahcs.html), [AoU RWB](https://support.researchallofus.org/hc/en-us/articles/6090679838100-How-to-Work-with-All-of-Us-Genomic-Data-Hail-Plink-), [MVP](https://med.stanford.edu/gbsc/projects/vapahcs.html), [FinnGen](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.03.22271360v1.full)). There are two options:; 1. Determine and implement the linear algebraic primitives necessary for SAIGE.; 2. Compile and link directly against SAIGE.

I have yet to create a simple reproducible example. Permuting the entries in this array does not change the output. I always get 'a' and 'b'. I suspect this is because what really matters is the order in which we traverse the entries of the multi map which depends on the hash of the nodes. I think a durable fix might be to eliminate the MultiMap, insert all the nodes into the binary heap, then increment priority for each edge detected. This will perform more reflows of the heap, but eliminates the non-determinism of MultiMap iteration order. ```; import hail as hl; ht = hl.Table.parallelize([; hl.Struct(i=hl.Struct(s=x[0]), j=hl.Struct(s=x[1])); for x in [('c', 'a'), ('a', 'b'), ('b', 'c'), ]; ]); hl.maximal_independent_set(ht.i, ht.j, False).collect(); ```. ### Version. 0.2.122. ### Relevant log output. _No response_",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13635:554,hash,hash,554,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13635,1,['hash'],['hash']

Security,"). A Certificate Authority (like; letsencypt or VeriSign) digitally signs the certificate of a user that has; proven they own the domain name mentioned in the certificate (see above; discussion of `CN` and `subjectAltName`). Web browsers have a file of the ""root""; certificates of the public Certificate Authorities. They establish a ""chain of; trust"" from a root certificate to the server's certificate. Our system is simpler. We have no root certificate. Each principal has a; certificate which is given to all the principals to which it might; communicate. ### Encryption. TLS has many encryption schemes. I will focus on encryption using a *symmetric*; key because asymmetric schemes do not enable *forward secrecy* [2]. Under; forward secret schemes, the two parties share a private key unknown to all; adversaries. TLS 1.3 makes forward secrecy mandatory. I intend to eventually; require all our services to refuse to speak anything other than TLS 1.3. The shared private key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages sent over a; socket. This poses a problem: how do two parties who have never met each other; agree on a private key without revealing the key to the public? This is a; classic cryptography problem called [key; exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_exchange). The classic solution to; this problem is [Diffie-Hellman key; exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie뉻ellman_key_exchange). The; Wikipedia article has ""General overview"" which is quite clear. In addition to a key, the parties must agree on a cipher. There are many old,; insecure ciphers available. In the future I intend all our servers to refuse to; use insecure ciphers. Mozilla; [has a list of secure cipher suites](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Recommended_configurations). ## New Hail Concepts. Every principal in our system has a secret: `ssl-config-NAME`. These secrets are; automatically created for a particular namespace by `tls/create_certs.py`.

Security,", but we do not verify; (proxied) servers. I load the client certificates anyway so that I can smoke; test them before I require servers verify them. For VERIFY_CA, we load server; certs, load client certs, verify clients, and verify (proxied) servers. For Hail principals, we only generate a json configuration; file containing the ssl mode and some named paths. The new `hailtop/ssl.py`; module defines the mapping from configuration to Python's; [`SSLContext`](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLContext). There is also one ""curl"" principal: the admin-pod. REQUIRED and DISABLED are; mostly the same because required passes the `insecure` flag. As curl is; client-only, there is no notion of ""incoming connection"". ---. FAQ. Does this recreate certs on each deploy?. Yes. How do services speak to each other while a deploy is happening? Newly deployed; services will only trust newly deployed clients?. `create_certs.py` includes the previous deploy's certificates in the trust; chain, so we can always accept clients from one deploy backwards. Old services; will not trust the new clients, but the `build.yaml` ensures things are deployed; in dependency order. Deploy would never work if a client could depend on; a not-yet-deployed server. ---. Things for you to verify:; - does every service load *its own unqiue* ssl-config secret?; - does every service use an SSL context for serving?; - does everyone who makes http requests to internal services use an SSL client; session?; - do all TLS-secured nginx instances include their http.conf in the `http`; section and the `proxy.conf` file in any proxying sections?; - Do the SSLContext's from `ssl.py` and the nginx configurations generated by; `create_certs.py` obey the aforementioned matrix?.

Security,", instead of returning a value. Under the hood, `JoinPoint`s are implemented; with a label and a `GOTO` instruction. ```scala; def example1(j: JoinPoint[Code[Int]]): Code[Ctrl] = Code(; j(3),; ""this line is never reached"".println,; j(4)); ```. ### `ParameterPack`. The trait `ParameterPack[A]` says that the type `A` is comprised of a list of `Code[T]`s, such that the structure of that list is statically known. While this is generally useful for representing deforested tuples, it is specifically useful here because it allows `JoinPoint`s to take multiple arguments as a tuple of the individual arguments. This ""tuple"" will be represented at runtime by pushing or popping multiple values from the JVM argument stack. ```scala; // case class JoinPoint[A: ParameterPack] ( .... ); def example2(j: JoinPoint[(Code[Int], Code[Boolean], Code[Int])]): Code[Ctrl] =; j((8, true, 9)); /* LDC 8; * LDC 1; * LDC 9; * GOTO j */; ```. ### `JoinPointBuilder`. The only way to create new join-points is via a `JoinPointBuilder` object, using the `joinPoint[A]` method (where `A` is the desired argument type). Then the body of the join-point can be provided by calling `define`. ```scala; val mb: MethodBuilder; // method builder required to create locals to store join point arguments; def example3(jb: JoinPointBuilder, exit: JoinPoint[Code[Int]]): JoinPoint[Code[Int]] = {; val j = jb.joinPoint[Code[Int]](mb); j.define { n => exit(n + 1) }; j; }; ```. ### `CallCC`. The only way to obtain a `JoinPointBuilder` is through a `CallCC`. `CallCC` also provides access to; the ""current continuation"" -- a join-point which takes an argument that will become the final result; of the entire `CallCC` expression. In fact, the only way to return a value from a `CallCC` is by; eventually calling this join-point. ```scala; val example4: Code[Boolean] =; JoinPoint.CallCC { (jb: JoinPointBuilder, ret: JoinPoint[Code[Boolean]]) =>; const(false).mux(; ret(false),; ret(true)); }; // running 'example4' gives 'true'; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7055:3644,access,access,3644,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7055,1,['access'],['access']

Security,". ### Notes of Annoyance. `aiohttp` silently ignores most invalid TLS requests, this makes debugging a TLS; issue difficult. `aiohttp`'s `raise_for_status` does not include the HTTP body in the; message. NGINX sometimes returns 400 in response to TLS issues with a proxy. It; includes crucial details in the HTTP body. I usually debug these issues by; sshing to the client pod and using curl to manually reproduce the error. Readiness and liveness probes cannot use HTTP. Although k8s supports HTTPS, it; does not support so-called ""mTLS"" or ""mutual TLS."" This is fancy verbiage for; servers that require clients to send trusted certificates. I will eventually require; this. There is a lot of information in GitHub issues and the Istio web pages; about this, but at the end of the day, kubernetes does not support this. TCP; probes are the best we can do. There [was a; PR](kubernetes/kubernetes#61231) to allow httpGet probes; to send the kubelet certificate, but it was closed because, apparently, the; [httpGet probes can be targeted at arbitrary IP; addresses](kubernetes/kubernetes#61231 (review)) (what; the hell?), ergo Confused Deputy. ### Future Work. - Require TLS 1.3 everywhere.; - Comply with Mozilla's ""Modern"" recommendations.; - [Incoming Trust](#incoming-trust).; - Refresh certificates after deploying new ones. ### Footnotes. [1] TLS: Transport Layer Security. Preceded by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) which; is not obsolete and insecure. After SSL version 3, a new version of SSL was; proposed in RFC 2246. This new version was backwards-incompatible and was; thus given a new name: Transport Layer Security. In common discussion, SSL; and TLS are used interchangeable. Indeed, the python TLS library is called; `ssl`. [2] Forward secrecy is a property of an encryption system. Forward secrecy means; a message cannot be decrypted in the future by an adversary who learned one; of the private keys. For example, imagine you are sending sensitive messages; to another individual.

Security,"82 indicate that a bad interaction between the data and a hash function can cause this integer map to exceed its size limitations at a load factor of 5%. Even a 20x increase in footprint puts us at 400 million. Each element of that array has 6 entries, so we're at 1.2 billion. That definitely feels like the danger zone. Maybe there's more variants than Danfeng expects, maybe there's more overhead than we've accounted for. The GATK folks have been chasing down the fix. Kryo [released 4.0.0](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo/issues/431) which should fix this issue. Spark [upgraded to Kryo 4.0.0](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22179) on September 8th of 2018. (resolving [Spark-20389](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20389)). This change made it to 2.4.0, but it was not back ported to other versions of Spark. GATK [references a temporary fix via JVM options](; https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1524#issuecomment-189368808), which apparently forces the JVM to use an alternative hash function with better behavior in this specific case:; ```; spark.executor.extraJavaOptions -XX:hashCode=0; spark.driver.extraJavaOptions -XX:hashCode=0; ```; A [generally interesting blog post on Java's hashCode](https://srvaroa.github.io/jvm/java/openjdk/biased-locking/2017/01/30/hashCode.html), which I haven't fully read, claims that the JVM previously defaulted to a PRNG draw for an object's hash code. In JDK 8 it uses some function of the current thread state. It appears this old strategy is preserved as JVM hashCode parameter value 0 and is less likely to trigger the bad behavior in Kryo. This `-XX:hashCode` option is undocumented [1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/java.html), [2](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/vmoptions-jsp-140102.html) 游뱡꽥勇.

This is most obvious in Node.js, which is the most popular library for server-side JS.; * [How event loop works](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/); <img width=""765"" alt=""screen shot 2019-01-18 at 11 20 51 am"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5543229/51399094-1f999c00-1b13-11e9-8dfb-da8aa20807b0.png"">. * The event loop call stack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ. At a high level, a function that defines a callback will return immediately. The callback is pushed on to the event-loop stack, and on each tick, is checked to determine whether it has returned or not. Blocking operations within the callbacks will block the event loop. This is how CPU viruses, like blockchain manage to slow down web pages that are hijacked to include some mining script: hashing something 30 million times, takes a long time, and JS cannot do anything besides waiting for those operations to finish in a synchronous fashion. Luckily, asynchronous functions are the norm in the JS ecosystem, such that both in the browser, and nodejs, IO functions are (mostly?) asynchronous.; * For NodeJS: Transparently to the user, blocking operations (IO) are executed from kernel threads that Node maintains in the background, effectively making these operations non-blocking (until the thread pool is exhausted). Browsers and NodeJS use different event loops:. NodeJS: libuv event loop; * Node maintains a hidden worker thread pool (kernel threads) through which it issues sys calls, to avoid blocking the event loop.

Security,"@armartin is getting (what appears to be) a hang running `import_table` on a table with 3K columns. The problem seems two-fold:; - When you access a tstruct field, it populates the jtype of each field. tstruct.__getitem__ should just get the jtype for the field being accessed. Aside, is there a bug in __getitem__? It isn't adding the type if you index by offset:. ```; def __getitem__(self, item):; if not isinstance(item, str):; item = self._fields[item]; self._add_jtypes(); return self._field_types[item]; ```. - Second, StructExpression.__init__ creates expressions for each field in the constructor.

Security,"@chrisvittal This will fix your define_function issue. I was wrong, the types were the same. @danking Something very strange is going on here. I can verify only one GenomeReference is being constructed, so this and concrete must be the same object, but eq is returning false. I don't see how this can be possible. I some something similar last week which caused me to add ReferenceGenome.hashCode (we were defining one but not the other).

Security,"@nawatts points out that the docs are missing the font-awesome icons. This new website; stuff is confusing! Here is how to think about it going forward:. This PR is the *long-term fix*. It will not resolve the current production issue. The easiest fix; for that is to release a new version of Hail, which will generate a new version of the docs. That; new version will be compatible with the currently released `website`. We have two phases: docs-generation-time and serve-time. Importantly, we always need to support the; *previously released documentation* with the current `main` `website`. This PR makes things work like this:. At docs-generation-time (which happens every time we release a new version of the Hail package to; PyPI), Sphinx uses `dynamic-base.html` to build the docs website. Those HTML files will look like; this:. ```; <!DOCTYPE html>; <html lang=""en"">; <head>; <title>Hail | {% block title %}{% endblock %}</title>. {% include ""base-head.html"" %}. <!-- Sphinx will insert some header stuff here -->; </head>; <body>; {% include ""nav-top.html"" %}; <div id=""main"">; {% raw %}; <!-- Sphinx will insert the actual documentation here -->; {% endraw %}; </div>; {% include ""nav-bottom.html"" %}; {% include ""base-foot.html"" %}; </body>; </html>; ```. Note that this is *still a Jinja2 template!*. At serve-time, `website` will run this through Jinja2 templating *a second time*. At this time,; we'll use the latest `base-head.html`. In particular, suppose I need access to a new CSS file in `nav-top.html`. I can modify; `base-head.html`. Since `base-head.html` is added to the web page *at serve-time*, it will include; all the latest changes.

Security,"A long-standing fixme in the LocalBackend was to not rely on HadoopFS, which we use with the SparkBackend for compatibility with dataproc and hdfs urls. By default, the HadoopFS doesn't understand gs urls. Users need to install the gcs-hadoop-connector (preinstalled in dataproc) to communicate with google cloud storage. Spark handles supplying credentials to the connector. Issue #13904 is caused by failing to properly supply the gcs-hadoop-connector with credentials in the LocalBackend. In the absence of config, the connector hangs while trying to fetch a token form a non-existant metadata server. The LocalBackend was designed to be a testing ground for lowered and compiled code that would eventually be run on batch, where we use the RouterFS. I propose a pragmatic fix for #13904 that ditches the HadoopFS for all but local filesystem access in the LocalBackend instead of identifying and fixing the root cause. In doing so, I made a couple of changes to how the RouterFS is configured: In the absence of the `HAIL_CLOUD` environment variable, RouterFS can handle gs and az urls iff credentials are not supplied.

Security,"A very small PR but here's the background and context behind this change. When talking to either GCP or Azure, hail chooses credentials in the following order from highest priority to lowest priority:. 1. An explicit `credential_file` argument passed to the relevant credentials class; 2. An environment variable containing the path to the credentials (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` or `AZURE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`) (from this you can see why the code that was here is totally redundant); 3. The latent credentials present on the machine. This might be `gcloud` or `az` credentials, or the metadata server if you're on a cloud VM. I'm trying to rid the codebase of most explicit providing of credentials file paths, for two reasons:; - Quality of life. I'm already signed into the cloud with `gcloud` and `az`. I shouldn't need to download some file and provide `AZURE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to run this test. It should just use the latent credentials.; - We are trying to phase out credentials files altogether for security reasons. These files are long-lived secrets that you really don't want to leak and are currently exposed to users in Batch jobs, so they can be easily exfiltrated. Using the latent credentials on a cloud VM (the metadata server) has the benefit of only issuing short-lived access tokens which last for hours not months, so it's basically always better to use the latent credentials when possible.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13981:1024,secur,security,1024,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13981,3,"['access', 'expose', 'secur']","['access', 'exposed', 'security']"

Security,"Assigning @tpoterba since he (and cotton) have the most context to review this. A few preliminaries:. 1. I noticed the proxy headers were not quite right when you're testing this without SSL or on some non-standard port. `$host` does not include the port, `$http_host` does. `$scheme` returns `http` or `https` depending on how the user connected to gateway; 2. The admin privilege check was too restrictive, if `delete_worker_pod` is called by `/new` there's no need to check admin privs; 3. I realized that the timeout logic wasn't quite right because a misconfigured gateway (I was testing with a broken gateway config) will return 5xx codes, but that doesn't mean the server is alive. We probably should error here, but I'm hesitant to add new error modes so close to a tutorial. Ok, how does this work? Basically, if the gateway cannot connect to the notebook pod, we intercept the error and redirect the user to the ""create new notebook"" webpage. That webpage deletes whatever remains of the users previous notebook pod & service. Here are the pieces:. 1. `recursive_error_pages on;` the internet suggests that without this we cannot use `error_page` with an ""internal"" rule (the `@` rules are internal rules that users cannot directly access); 2. `proxy_connect_timeout` defaults to 60s which is a shit user experience if your pod dies. Honestly, I might set this to 100ms. This is all inside a datacenter.; 3. `proxy_intercept_errors` permits us to use `error_page` with 5xx errors from failing to connect to the proxy. ---. I tested this with a pile of hacks to deploy this into an anonymous namespace in `vdc`. I'm not ready to PR those changes, they need a clean up before others use them.

Security,"Both of these were noted by Bernick as a part of his security review. 1. `local_infile`: if this is on, a client could in theory read any file on the instance by loading it into a table.; 2. `skip_show_database`: this disables `SHOW DATABASES` by default; we can still grant certain users (e.g. the admin-pod) the `SHOW DATABASES` privilege.

Security,"Brought up by TJ in a recent conversation. He wants to not use the browser to work on Jupyter notebooks for performance / IDE convenience reasons. From a brief look, there appear to be two issues in getting this to work. First, VS Code will need to be started with proxy flags. As its runtime is Electron, all Chromium flags will work, so could almost specify HAILCTL_CHROME=code hailctl connect ... , but this doesn't directly work because VS Code also needs a workspace (so the cli invocation will need to be slightly different). Second, password-less may not work without `disable_xsrf_check`. Relevant issue: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/7137. There may be ways to hijack a proxied localhost connection, so unless we fully understand those issues, if disable_xsrf_check is necessary to enable password-less, it would be better to generate a token.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/9067:540,password,password-less,540,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/9067,2,['password'],['password-less']
Security,"Builds on #3500 . This PR introduces support for sparse block matrices. The only new command exposed in Python is `sparsify_row_intervals`. Matrix product currently always results in a dense block matrix. Sparse block matrices also support transpose, diagonal, and all non-mathematical operations except filtering. Element-wise mathematical operations are currently supported if and only if they cannot transform zeroed blocks to non-zero blocks. For example, all forms of element-wise multiplication are supported,; and element-wise multiplication results in a sparse block matrix with block support equal to the intersection of that of the operands. On the other hand, scalar addition is not supported, and matrix addition is supported only between block matrices with the same block sparsity. Once this is in, I'll expose a couple more sparsifiers (rectangles, band) and also bring in parallel export of many rectangles to TSV from another branch, so that users can proceed with LD / fine mapping applications. Down the line I plan to support for all operations by expanding to union of block support, or to all blocks, for some operations. And matrix multiplication ought to return the minimal number of blocks as well.",MatchSource.ISSUE,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3501:93,expose,exposed,93,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3501,2,['expose'],"['expose', 'exposed']"

Security,"CHANGELOG: Fix long-standing bug wherein `hl.agg.collect_as_set` and `hl.agg.counter` error when applied to types which, in Python, are unhashable. For example, `hl.agg.counter(t.list_of_genes)` will not error when `t.list_of_genes` is a list. Instead, the counter dictionary will use `FrozenList` keys from the `frozenlist` package. Hey @iris-garden ! I figured this was good reviewing practice for you and also a chance to see how we convert data to/from JSON and to/from the JVM (by way of this ""encoded"" representation which is a binary one). The details of that are not super important to this PR, but you might take a peek to understand the change. The main issue here is that in Python, you can't write:; ```; {[1]}; ```; Because sets must contain ""hashable"" data. Python lists are not hashable because they're mutable. This is transitively a problem. For example, the following also fails with the same error because the list inside the tuple is mutable thus the tuple is not (safely) hashable.; ```; {(""tuples"", ""are"", ""immutable"", [""lists"", ""are"", ""not""])}; ```. Hail's internal language is fully immutable, so every type can be placed inside a set (or used as the keys of a dict). When we convert from Hail's internal representation to Python, we cannot use mutable types in hashable positions. Unfortunately, we also need to maintain backwards compatibility with the way the code currently works. You can see this pretty clearly in the difference between `hl.agg.collect` and `hl.agg.collect_as_set`:; ```; t = hl.utils.range_table(1); t = t.annotate(ls = [1, 2, 3]); collected_ls = t.aggregate(hl.agg.collect(t.ls)); collected_as_set_ls = t.aggregate(hl.agg.collect_as_set(t.ls)); ```; `collected_ls` should be `[[1, 2, 3]]` whereas `collected_as_set_ls` necessarily uses hashable types: `{frozenlist([1, 2, 3])}`. Things are particularly subtle with dictionaries whose keys must always be hashable and whose values need only be hashable if the dictionary itself must be hashable.

Security,"CHANGELOG: Fixes #13697, a long standing issue with QoB, in which a failing partition job or driver job is not failed in the Batch UI. I am not sure why we did not do this this way in the first place. If a JVMJob raises an exception, Batch will mark the job as failed. Ergo, we should raise an exception when a driver or a worker fails!. Here's an example: I used a simple pipeline that write to a bucket to which I have read-only access. You can see an example Batch (where every partition fails): https://batch.hail.is/batches/8046901. [1]. ```python3; import hail as hl; hl.utils.range_table(3, n_partitions=3).write('gs://neale-bge/foo.ht'); ```. NB: I removed the `log.error` in `handleForPython` because that log is never necessary. That function converts a stack of exceptions into a triplet of the short message, the full exception with stack trace, and a Hail error id (if present). That triplet is always passed along to someone else who logs the exception. (FWIW, the error id indicates a Python source location that is associated with the error. On the Python-side, we can look up that error id and provide a better stack trace.). [1] You'll notice the logs are missing. I noticed this as well, it's a new bug.
