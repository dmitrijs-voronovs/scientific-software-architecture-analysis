Availability," (should be your 3.7.8) and try `import pyamg` in the shell. If the ""No such file or directory"" error shows up, it means pyamg was not correctly installed; otherwise it is in fact installed. In the latter case, you can check if your python is configured to enable shared libraries. To do it, according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23201498/how-to-check-if-python3-was-built-with-enable-shared), in the python shell you can type ; `import sysconfig`; `sysconfig.get_config_vars('Py_ENABLE_SHARED')`; If the result is `[0]`, ie ""False"", you have to build python with the option `--enable-shared`. ; Now, I don't know how to do accomplish that with conda, but with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) it involves installing the desired python version with `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install <version>`. To recap, a ""workflow for newbies"" which appears to be working for me is. 1. install pyenv either from [source](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) or from your distibution repositories, if available. IMPORTANT: make sure the environment variables are correctly set and `pyenv init` is added to your shell, as per the installation instructions.; 2. install the desired python version (for example 3.7.8), enabling shared libraries: ; `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install 3.7.8`; 3. clone/download the [feature_adap](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/feature_adap) branch of SU2;; 4. in the SU2 folder, configure meson ; `./meson.py build` ; and make sure to update the environment variables in your `.bashrc` as indicated by meson's output.; 5. use ninja to build and install SU2 ; `./ninja -C build install`;; if you run into a permission error, specify an installation directory passing the `--prefix` option to meson, as explained [here](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2-installation/227676-su-installation-failed-due-insufficient-permissions.html).

It is important that the linear solve behaves well for each nonlinear iteration, so if this does not converge immediately, adjust the tolerance or number of linear iterations. Roe seems very stable, but some of the other upwind schemes or centered schemes may require improved Jacobian accuracy (to recover fast convergence) with:. ```; USE_ACCURATE_FLUX_JACOBIANS= YES; CENTRAL_JACOBIAN_FIX_FACTOR= 4.0; ```. ### RANS; Due to the segregated approach for the turbulence models, you have to be more conservative with the CFL adaption. All else is the same as above, but I recommend. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down, factor up, CFL min value,; % CFL max value ); CFL_ADAPT= YES; CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.1, 1.2, 10.0, 1e3); ```. Most inviscid/laminar cases that I have tested so far converge to machine precision within a couple of hundred iterations. RANS cases within a few thousand. Ultra fine RANS meshes can still slow things down (MG could help there), but otherwise, speedups of an order of magnitude (or more) are possible for most problems. Experiment yourselves.. sometimes you can get even more performance, sometimes less, case depending. I could use help testing this one with your cases, since I think almost all regression tests will change. As a start, I have run all of the NASA TMR 2D bump-in-channel cases. Everything looks good with that (see figures). I have also checked that the inviscid and laminar MMS give 2nd-order accuracy properly. ![bump_cd_gridconv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4896083/64910870-09f36b00-d6d0-11e9-9e1c-553fd09b42c8.png); ![bump_cf_0p63_gridconv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4896083/64910871-09f36b00-d6d0-11e9-8148-f211260dbf8f.png); ![bump_cf_0p75_gridconv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4896083/64910872-09f36b00-d6d0-11e9-8772-6e26a8bd08b0.png); ![bump_cf_0p87_gridconv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4896083/64910873-0a8c0180-d6d0-11e9-8c61-208809ff64e0.png); ![b",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790:3063,down,down,3063,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790,1,['down'],['down']

In `issue_complicated.zip`, filenames and cfg files are a bit different but the meshes are the same. Observed and expected behaviour; ===========================; I would expect that the two simulations give similar results. However, the singlezone setup converges while the multizone setup diverges (`SU2 has diverged (NaN detected).` or `SU2 has diverged (Residual > 10^20 detected).`). The same behaviour is observed for CFL=10 instead of 1000, and also for SA with CFL=10. I ran v7.2.0 (commit 3ec1c680) in serial (without MPI). I reported a similar problem some time ago in the developer meeting, with a ""chopped NACA 0012 airfoil"" testcase. For this issue we created this more basic example which seems to reproduce the error (although I am not completely sure). Typically we would see the `SU2 has diverged (Residual > 10^20 detected).` error. Differences between multizone/fluid-interface and singlezone/joined-meshes; =========================================================; We came up with the following differences:; - **Flux calculation across the interface**: The flux between neighbor cells `i`, `j`, one of which has `radius<4` and the other one has `radius>4`, is computed differently.; + In singlezone this is just an ordinary flux computation along an edge `i`-`j`, with `CSolver::Upwind_Residual` (, `Viscous_Residual`).; + In multizone this flux between two zones is computed by `CSolver::BC_Fluid_Interface`. When the method is called to compute the contribution of the interface on the residual of contol volume `i`, `this` is the solver object of the zone of control volume `i`, so we can access all variables at `i` (like primitive, turbulent, and their spatial gradients) and give",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1414:3491,error,error,3491,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1414,1,['error'],['error']

Be able to do multiple types of geometry evaluation (for example wing+fuselage); 4. Expose some of the mesh deformation functions to python to allow for robust design variable definition; 5. Perform all of the shape optimization using the in-memory python scripts; 6. Intelligent handling of solution divergences that doesn't break the optimization; 7. Better way to define multipoint optimizations; 8. Better multi-objective optimization definition (#913 might be helpful in this); 9. Simplify the multitude of shape optimization options (#733). As you can probably tell, a lot of my examples and motivations revolve around aerospace applications. So while I try and make a general framework that is robust, I might not be thinking in a broad enough fashion. I would love to get input from the community for any functionality that they might want to see in this framework. The more robust this is, the more widely useful it will be. I am also a newbie to the python wrapper world of SU2.

Availability," SU2 Conference, a run of the full tape reveals that a variable used in a preaccumulation output is not properly recorded. The variable is the `val` in the function `PassiveAssign` in `CSysMatrix.hpp` line 215. `FORCEINLINE static ScalarType PassiveAssign(const SrcType& val) {; return SU2_TYPE::GetValue(val);; }`. Following the call stack of the error reveals that the problem variables in `val` are the jacobian components calculated in the Roe and JST scheme (these are the two options I have tested). It is possible to resolve this error by simply moving the stopping of the preaccumulation region from before the call to `updateLinearSystem` in the `ComputeFlux` method of both these schemes, to after, as show below. `/*--- Update the vector and system matrix. ---*/. updateLinearSystem(iEdge, iPoint, jPoint, implicit, updateType,; updateMask, flux, jac_i, jac_j, vector, matrix);. /*--- Stop preaccumulation. ---*/. stopPreacc(flux);`. However, whilst this resolve the error in this location, the next error appears in the Giles boundary condition. Here the two jacobian components within the residual object are not recorded correctly in the preaccumulation output region also. This in `CEulerSolver.cpp:6556`. `/*--- Compute the residual using an upwind scheme ---*/; auto residual = conv_numerics->ComputeResidual(config);. /*--- Update residual value ---*/; LinSysRes.AddBlock(iPoint, residual);`. I have tried simpy adding these components as preacc outputs however they are SIMD arrays and the datatype cannot be converted using the existing implementation. . I am not sure what is going on here, or the next steps to resolve this problem.

In this case, I first downloaded the 'develop' branch to make sure everything is consitent with Pedro, and then I downloaded and replaced the 6 new committed files that related to the supersonic inlet profile development. The code should be totally the same at this point. And I did a flat plate test, which actually I need to fill a uniform profile, since the code would only generated an empty one. However, a segment error still occurs, and I attched the error file with Valgrind output. The test files are on the above conversations so that you may also take a try. Thanks for the help! [error.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16323710/error.txt). From the error, I think The SU2_CFD encountered an invalid memory read operation during an attempt to read the inletUNI.dat file, causing the program to crash with a segment error (SIGSEGV). The specific error occurs in the CConfig::GetInletPtotal function, which seems attempts to access memory that has not been properly initialized or allocated.

Availability," do not work as well as for fluid problems due to the elliptic nature of the equations.; Scalability is also an issue since most preconditioners get weaker as the problem gets partitioned.; Direct sparse solvers handle these problems just fine, so life is good again, until you run out of RAM that is (which only ever happens in 3D). Time complexity is about O(N^2) and storage O(N^1.5). ## Proposed Changes; Wrapper class for Inria's direct sparse solver [PaStiX](http://pastix.gforge.inria.fr/files/README-txt.html).; Why this solver? Because it is open source, has active development in advanced features like GPU support and compression techniques to reduce memory footprint, and from my experience it is really robust. ## Implementation; As this feature benefits mostly the FSI people (@rsanfer, @cvencro, and me) I tried to keep it as standalone as possible.; The core implementation is in separate files and nothing needs to change in CSysMatrix for this to work. ## Usage; Available factorizations:; - LDLT; - LU; - ILU(k). The ILU is different from the one we have in that it is computed for the entire matrix and not just for the local matrices (i.e. it considers halos), it is not very fast though.; The three factorizations can be used as preconditioners via options PASTIX_ILU, PASTIX_LU, and PASTIX_LDLT. And the first two as solvers via options PASTIX_LU and PASTIX_LDLT (in which case you should use a preconditioner type that does not cause CSysMatrix to allocate extra memory (LU_SGS).; The reason LDLT and LU can also be used as preconditioners is that it is possible to set a factorization frequency (via PASTIX_FACTORIZATION_FREQUENCY) so that the factorizations are only computed every N iterations or only on the first call (frequency set to 0), this is very useful for non linear elasticity.; The fill-in for the ILU is set via PASTIX_FILL_LEVEL, I did not reuse the option we have again to keep CSysMatrix from allocating any more than it needs to.; By default the solvers run",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/771:1211,Avail,Available,1211,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/771,1,['Avail'],['Available']

Availability," feature of a future release is going in the direction of what you need. Compiled libraries would be easy to handle via pkg config. . Ah, I did not understand that this is something you were already working on and were asking me to test, I thought you were suggesting to use develop to install the software on our production cluster. I should not have assumed that, it's just something that is unfortunately quite frequent in the field of scientific software (just use the head of the git repo). I did not have any clone of the repo, so did not see that script (only the one in `legacy`) initially. . ```; $ ./preconfigure.py --help; usage: preconfigure.py [-h] [--with-own-meson] [--no-codi] [--no-medi]; [--no-opdi] [--no-mpp] [--no-coolprop] [--no-mel]; [--no-mlpcpp]. optional arguments:; -h, --help show this help message and exit; --with-own-meson download own copies of Meson and Ninja; --no-codi do not download own copy of CoDiPack; --no-medi do not download own copy of MeDiPack; --no-opdi do not download own copy of OpDiLib; --no-mpp do not download own copy of Mutationpp; --no-coolprop do not download own copy of CoolProp; --no-mel do not download own copy of MEL; --no-mlpcpp do not download copy of MLpCpp; ``` . It seems like to go in the right direction. Is there a plan to provide options to specify how to find installed copies of those ? Something like `--medi=/path/to/installed/medi` and such ? pkgconfig or other auto-detection mechanisms usually work, but sometimes it doesn't, and explicit workarounds sometimes help. . I also don't see other packages that end up in externals, such as `metis`, `parmetis`, `autotools`, `catch2`. I am not sure how those are used (or if they are used), but I noticed folders for them in the `externals` folder.

So in case you don't have meson and ninja installed (there should be packages available for all major distros), compile ninja using:. ```; cd externals/ninja; ./configure.py --bootstrap; cd ..; export PATH=$PWD/externals/ninja:$PWD/externals/meson:$PATH; ```; and run meson using; ```; meson.py build --prefix=$PWD -Denable-pywrapper=true -Denable-autodiff=true; ```; to ocnfigure SU2 with the python wrapper and AD support enabled. MPI support will be enabled by default if a proper mpi installation can be found. ; Finally compile the code with; ```; ninja -C build; ```. - ""build"" in the commands above is a folder where the configuration will be stored. You can configure multiple directories with different configurations (like for a debug build etc); - ninja uses all available cores in your system by default. Still you can set the number of jobs using `-j N`. ### Additional notes; - Meson requires python 3, so implicitly we get this requirement now. But I think it is less of a problem than some of you probably might think. A lot of problems we have come from the fact the we support python 2 and python 3. As I was setting up travis (getting there in a moment) I noticed that is easily possible to compile the code with python 3 (for the python wrapper) and run the python scripts with python 2 and vice versa, which eventually leads to errors and crashes. If we require(!) version 3 (which should be installed on all machines now ...) we can avoid such problems from the beginning. Furthermore, python 2 is deprecated anyway ... - I already changed travis to use the new build system. This as one major advantage: we can now properly use ccache and the caching feature of travis (that means only files that have changed will",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/745:2103,avail,available,2103,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/745,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability," revision e6e6e6b are very small, aside from an extra test file. But revision d1e3a18 fails the regression tests and revision e6e6e6b passes the regression tests. Specifically, it's only the CHT incompressible case that's failing. The test results show:. test_vals (stored): 0.000000, 0.000000, -7.685301, -12947.783696; sim_vals (computed): 0.000000, 0.000000, -7.685301, -12947.783678 ; delta_vals: 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000018. It's only the total heat flux that's different, and it's only off by 1E-7%. I believe that these changes are due to floating-point errors. To check and make sure nothing is going crazy, I ran the test case under both the develop and the PR branches. When I compared the solution files, I couldn't find any points where the solution differed by more than 0.0003%. The differences seem to be very small. The two differences between revision d1e3a18 and revision e6e6e6b can be summarized as follows:. 1. In the `CNumerics::GetViscousIncProjJacs()` calculation on the develop branch, a quantity called `theta` is calculated. `theta` is the magnitude of the `val_normal` parameter, squared. The catch is that `val_normal` is passed as a unit vector (named `UnitNormal` in `CAvgGradInc_Flow::ComputeResidual`). So `theta` should always be equal to one, with some floating point errors. In the failing revision, the value is set explicitly to one. In the passing revision, the magnitude is calculated explicitly. I checked, and the difference between `theta` and 1.0 is always of the order 1E-16 or less.; 2. The second change affects where the area is multiplied into the Jacobian. When the area is multiplied at a later stage, very small differences in the calculated quantities appear. I don't like revision e6e6e6b, and I would like to revert it. The question then is how to update the tests. We could just update the regression test values, but I would propose fixing the regression test. It seems to be sensitive to what I believe are unimportant differences.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/626#issuecomment-444655022:1509,error,errors,1509,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/626#issuecomment-444655022,1,['error'],['errors']

Availability," scheme for a multi-physics problem. To obtain the design accuracy in time, this implies that the loop over the number of time stages is outside the loop over the number of physical disciplines. Hence at a very high level in the hierarchy, the details of the time integration should then be known. The situation becomes even more complicated when one would like to employ time integration schemes that allow for time accurate local time stepping, e.g. the ones we are currently working on for the DG solver. I won't bore you with all the details here, but those schemes basically require the loop over the multiple disciplines to be between the predictor and corrector step, while both these steps consist of multiple stages. Although it is probably possible to come up with a data structure that supports all this, the question is whether this is desirable. Apart from the fact that it would require a major overhaul in the high level design of SU2, the implementation will be less readable, especially for people that will be starting with the code. Also the parallelization may become significantly more complicated. The alternative is that for unsteady multi-physics problems, we put the restriction that only single stage time integration schemes can be used, e.g. DT_STEPPING_1ST and DT_STEPPING_2ND. In that case, the details of the time integration scheme can be hidden at the driver level, where we then simply have a loop over the number of physical disciplines. The consequence of course is that more advanced time integration schemes will not be available for multi-physics problems. In the above I just tried to picture what, in my opinion, the consequences are for either option. I don't have a preference for one of them. The only thing I wanted to make clear is that it is not possible to hide all the details of the time integration scheme at the driver level, while also having support for all possible time integration schemes for an unsteady multi-physics problem.

Availability," tests, grouping tests into suites, and running checks. This choice was based on what is available in our development setup. We have integrated our unit tests into our Travis CI regression testing. Every time we push commits or submit a pull request, the unit tests are run and checked. ## What is my vision for unit testing in SU2?. I am *not* proposing that we start trying to get 100% code coverage with pre-existing code. That would not provide a good return on investment. Instead, I see people adding unit tests as they write new code and as they find bugs. For each new behavior added to SU2, tests are first added to document the related existing behavior. These tests serve to check that the existing behavior isn't damaged by the new code. Then new tests are added to prove that the new behavior is working correctly. For bug fixes, the process is simpler. A test is added to confirm that something is not behaving as expected. Then the code is fixed to make the test pass. ## What frameworks are available?. For a unit testing framework, here are the most popular options, with the following pros and cons:. #### Roll-your-own. + Requires no external dependencies; + The most flexible option; + Involves the most work to setup; + Will lack some of the more advances features of mature unit-testing frameworks. #### Boost Test. + Can be header only, statically linked, or dynamically linked; + If statically or dynamically linked, then Boost is not very lightweight; + Easy to add if you're already using Boost. #### Google Test. + Most common unit-testing framework; + Can be easily combined with Google's powerful GMock mocking library; + Compiling and linking can be somewhat painful. #### Catch2. + Used by FEniCS; + Makes unit tests easily readable with lots of syntactic sugar.; + Has a very simple syntax; + Is header-only; + ~~Requires C++11 compilation~~ Requires C++11 for full feature set, but offers a C++03 branch; + Not as feature rich as Google Test or Boost Test. ## Question",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/698:3448,avail,available,3448,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/698,1,['avail'],['available']

The artifacts disappear if we disable MUSCL everywhere (1st order solution) or disable it only on boundaries (not ideal solution, but disabling only on corners would still be good enough for now I believe).

Availability," threads arrive to that routine. This also makes the routines safe to call in serial.; The only ""dangerous"" things to do in parallel are to: manage memory for a shared object (multiple threads call `new` but there is only one shared pointer on which to call `delete`); writing to the same memory locations concurrently.; I tried to make the first issue debugable by asserting that the initialization routines of CSysMatrix and CSysVector are only called by the master thread.; For the second issue I made the associated classes as const-correct as possible, that should at least make someone think twice before changing a member variable of those classes. The risk is still there for input variables as an algorithm development aspect... For example `MatrixVectorProductTransposed` cannot be made thread-parallel as simply/naively as its normal counterpart. ### Communication Model; The MPI + Threads communication model is very simple, currently only the master thread calls MPI routines (including `Error`), this requires thread barriers before and after the communication to make sure the correct values are passed and _seen_ by all threads.; We can test other alternatives in the future but at the moment this does not seem to be a significant bottleneck.; _Worksharing_ constructs have implicit barriers at completion, for CSysVector routines I used `nowait` modifiers, it is safe to call those routines in sequence since the loop sizes, and static work scheduling specifications are identical.; However, routines that access a CSysVector in a different way, should have an explicit barrier before using the vector (or risk having undefined behaviour). You will see these barriers on entry to matrix-vector product, and every `ComputeXXXPreconditioner` (if you don't, let me know xD). I think those routines are large enough to amortise the cost of this. ### Performance; Disclaimer:; - We are talking about linear solvers only, **you will not see a global improvement yet**.; - The large global ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/830#issuecomment-562646766:1782,Error,Error,1782,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/830#issuecomment-562646766,1,['Error'],['Error']

When Brian (@bmunguia ) and I mentioned PETSc, it was an idea to try a different Newton-Krylov (with preconditioner) library in order to improve the convergence of SU2.; Since the slow convergence of the SU2-FV is the main feedback that I received from other users from industry and academia, I think it worth try an external library and evaluate the performance.

A quick test without resorting to another library is to increase the fill-in for ILU-preconditioned GMRES, which is very expensive/slow but should converge difficult problems, and to check how high we can take the CFL when allowing each nonlinear iteration to converge to a tight tolerance in the linear solver, say 1e-14 (you can output the linear solver residuals to verify convergence). If we can take the CFL higher with a more performant linear solver, then it could be worth the effort to try other options.; >If the CFL must remain low for stability, then perhaps we should look at the quality of the Jacobians we construct to see if we can improve, or even try exact Jacobians with AD if we can afford it.

Some time ago, I made a PR #1066 to correct the SA model in SU2. Further I had the intention to implement the above presented approach to the SA for that pull request. However since the the presented approach can also be applied to the [SST](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/discussions/1403#discussion-3625259) or any turbulence model, I decided to create a new pull request. _Please note that this is a very draft pull request, it is not meant to work at all._. ## Documentation; Down below I will explain the ""theory"" behind it as well as the code structure that I will try to follow, just in case someone wants to replicate it for the SST. Regarding the user interface, I did not work on that yet. I will address it at the end. ### Theory; The Spalart-Allamaras correction/variation models to be implemented in SU2 are listed below. One can find a detailed description for example in [NASA TMR website](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/spalart.html).; - Spalart-Allmaras standard; - Spalart-Allmaras negative; - Spalart-Allmaras **yes** ft2 term; - Spalart-Allmaras mixing layer compressibility correction; - Spalart-Allmaras Edwards modification; - Spalart-Allmaras QCR-2000. The first step is to identify the core, i.e., the mathematical formulation that is shared/common between all of them. Below I provide a very short description of their main characteristics. #### Spalart-Allmaras standard; In the literature one can find a correction that sets the ft2-term to zero. However, the current baseline model in SU2 sets this ft2-term to zero.

Availability," with more cores, as all objects files are build truly in parallel (with make only objects of the same target are build in parallel). Another advantage is that meson has multiplatform support for linux, mac and windows. . ### Why not cmake ?; Meson files are much easier to read and in general it is much better to maintain. Furthermore it has a great documentation. Finally, meson has no dependencies apart from python and we can easily ship it (as a submodule) since it needs no installation/compilation. . ### What is ninja ?; ninja is a replacement for make and is used to execute the compiler and to resolve dependencies. Meson uses ninja as the default backend. So instead of using configure + make, we use meson + ninja. As with meson, we can ship it as a submodule. It needs a compilation, but again it has no dependencies apart from python. ### How to use ?; The correct meson and ninja versions are added as git submodules. So in case you don't have meson and ninja installed (there should be packages available for all major distros), compile ninja using:. ```; cd externals/ninja; ./configure.py --bootstrap; cd ..; export PATH=$PWD/externals/ninja:$PWD/externals/meson:$PATH; ```; and run meson using; ```; meson.py build --prefix=$PWD -Denable-pywrapper=true -Denable-autodiff=true; ```; to ocnfigure SU2 with the python wrapper and AD support enabled. MPI support will be enabled by default if a proper mpi installation can be found. ; Finally compile the code with; ```; ninja -C build; ```. - ""build"" in the commands above is a folder where the configuration will be stored. You can configure multiple directories with different configurations (like for a debug build etc); - ninja uses all available cores in your system by default. Still you can set the number of jobs using `-j N`. ### Additional notes; - Meson requires python 3, so implicitly we get this requirement now. But I think it is less of a problem than some of you probably might think.

Availability," would likely perform better as it avoids the pesky gather/scatter operations.; Processing multiple geometric primitives can make full utilization of whatever register size (important on GPU's), the code is just as readable (as I hope to show), but gather/scatter cannot be avoided. ### Intro to SPMD; This one is simpler, in a nutshell multiple threads operate on the sub domain of an MPI rank.; The typical implementation has each thread executing a chunk of an edge or cell loop. **Why should we care about SPMD?**; Reduce the communication overhead resulting from domain decomposition and improve load balancing, important for strong scaling.; Some algorithms are more efficient that way, e.g. the ADT (as mentioned by Edwin), the current MG also seems to work better on fewer partitions, and additive versions of preconditioners like the ILU or LU-SGS lose effectiveness with number of partitions.; Optimum hardware utilization, for routines that are bandwidth-bound it may be beneficial to use all threads available, while for compute-bound or ""algorithm-bound"" ones this may not be the case. **Relation with algorithms**; A typical edge loop reads from 2 locations and writes to 2 locations (gather / scatter access pattern, not to be confused with the instructions) processing multiple edges at the same time can therefore result in race conditions where multiple threads try to update the data of the same point.; There are 3 ways to address this:; - **Coloring**: Edges are colored (grouped) such that edges of the same color have no risk of race conditions, i.e. each endpoint is referenced only once per color (this definition gives you the basis of a greedy algorithm to color edges).; - **Scatter to gather transformations**: Edge quantities (e.g. fluxes) are computed and stored on one pass (i.e. we read from 2 locations and write to 1), on a second pass, over points, we reduce (e.g. sum) the edge quantities for each point, again a gather access pattern.

Availability,"## **BUG DESCRIPTION**. ## **Flow scenario**; The following 3D-centrifugal impeller was designed and the flow field simulated. The aim was to optimize the blade leading edge with respect to outlet static pressure (_please note that the mesh is rotating_):. ![Screenshot (157)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96534491/236707270-c9de2899-1a72-4876-975c-eabaec826c4f.png). The mesh is deliberately coarse being the intention to firstly perform the simulation utilizing Euler's convective scheme. ; Subsequently, the flow field is computed correctly and the solution is converged. The solution was obtained setting up the turbomachinery simulation options available in SU2. After this initial procedure the FFD Box was successfully generated ( FFD_DEGREE = 2,2,2 ) and attached to the domain as explained in the tutorials ( *using SU2_DEF* ). The FFD box appears as follows:. *FFD box edges: green ; FFD box control point: yellow; There is no intersection between FFD edges and periodic boundaries*. ![Screenshot (158)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96534491/236707553-92fb9e5a-3808-4ea0-a02e-43b574de44c0.png).

Availability,"## Motivation; Fundamental bottlenecks exist for industrial adoption of high-fidelity physics codes with fully coupled discrete adjoint sensitivity analysis. These bottlenecks include a lack of flexibility, modularity, and robustness of the computational tools, as well as the potential startup development costs needed to implement and verify the MDAO features. The purpose of this work is to facilitate the coupling of SU2 with external structural codes (e.g. NASTRAN, TACS, Airbus structural suite Lagrange) for gradient-based aerodynamic shape and structural sizing optimization using dedicated frameworks (e.g. OpenMDAO). . Startup development costs include the creation of modular tools that are _designed to be driven_ by another framework like OpenMDAO, rather than _to drive execution_ themselves. However, leveraging those MDAO frameworks assumes that software codes and modules to be coupled exist, have appropriate data structures, execution and query APIs, and are wrapped in Python for flexibility and ease of use. The proposed changes were motivated with the goal of making SU2 more modular and flexible, particularly to facilitate its integration into large-scale MDAO frameworks. For more details on the motivation, methodology, and verification & validation results, please refer to our [paper from AIAA Aviation 2022](https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-3358). . ## Proposed Changes; @aa-g and I propose the following code updates:. 1. Implementation of residual-based discrete adjoint solver as `CDiscAdjResidualSolver`; a. New config option: `KIND_DISC_ADJ` . 2. Enhancements and standardization of SU2 Python API; a. Add pysu2/pysu2ad methods; b. Standardize Python API and function names ; c. Overloaded getter/setter methods to make data handling more flexible. ## Related Work; These efforts are related to Issue #1262, Pull Request #1300, and Discussion [#1325](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/discussions/1325). . ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the deve",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1750:223,robust,robustness,223,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1750,1,['robust'],['robustness']

Availability,"## Proposed Changes. The draft pull request has changes to fix couple of issues in the incompressible solver for rotating frame and convergence rate of unsteady problems (both with and without grid movement).; ; For the rotating frame, there was a confusion between conservative and primitive variables being used for the numerics. For the convergence rate of unsteady problems, the Jacobian contributions in the dual time residual calculations had been altered to include the preconditioner. However, this slows down the convergence from only an order of 100 iterations needed for converged solution per time step to the order of 1000 iterations. Therefore this has been reverted to regain the previous faster convergence rate and further work is necessary to understand the reason for this change. ## Related Work; PR #652 . ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes. This is a draft PR to discuss and document a much needed overhaul of the shape optimization features in SU2. There have been significant improvements to the main code base (for example, python wrapper integration, the new output structure, new mesh solver etc.) which haven't been leveraged by the shape optimization structure of SU2. . The main idea behind this overhaul is to move as much of the functionality of the current shape optimization framework to python. This creates a more user-friendly and robust interface for defining design variables and constraints. Its easy to make that claim, but let me elucidate it with an example:. > Suppose I am trying to optimize a wing for a given flight condition but I want more design freedom than altering the airfoil shapes along the wing using FFDs. I want to be able to control wing span, taper ratio, dihedral angle, twist, and any number of other geometrical representations of the wing. Currently, I would have to create a new Design Variable (DV) for most of those variables. If anyone has tried this, they know it is a tedious task with having to make alterations in various parts of the code.; >; > But all of these design variables can be represented by aggregations of FFD point movements. The span of the wing can be controlled by constraining the movement of FFD points in the y-direction to be proportional to their y coordinate. The current twist variable does a similar aggregation, at each twist location it rotates the corresponding 4 FFD points by the given angle. ; >; >These design variables could be represented by simple python functions that take in a set of FFD points and aggregate their movement in the desired way. All this can be done without any incision into the C++ code, given a python interface that can provide the C++ code the final FFD point locations and letting it do the deformation. . Moving functionality to python could also remove the need for some of the other SU2 modules that haven't ",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/922:526,robust,robust,526,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/922,2,['robust'],['robust']

Availability,"## Proposed Changes. This is intended to be a small PR, but a big design shift. As discussed in issue #698, unit tests can serve an important role in software development. They complement, rather than replace, validation and verification tests. They are most useful when you want to isolate a specific behavior. Unit-testing increases development time, but improves the quality of the code and reduces code-maintenance time \[[source](https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/TDDpaperv8.pdf)\]. ### Vision. In my mind, the most efficient way to proceed is to add unit tests as new behaviors are added and bugs are fixed. With each new PR, we should ask ""Should this have a unit test to verify this behavior?"" Unit tests will provide a clear way to show that each PR does what the developer promises it will do. This will require refactoring some of the code. Some parts of the code, like the CConfig class, are not unit-testing friendly. Unit testing is hard when you have God-classes and ""do-it-all"" functions. The hope is that refactoring these classes will lead to more modular and easier-to-maintain code. ### Decision to use Catch2. Catch2 was chosen for the unit testing library for the following reasons:. + It can be included as a header-only library.; + It has a very clean, easy-to-use syntax; + It has widespread use, including the FEniCS library. ### Design choices. The following design choices are in place. If you disagree with them, then please start a discussion here:. + All tests are placed in a root-level directory named `UnitTests`. Inside this directory is a structure just like the existing folder structure (e.g. `SU2_CFD/numerics`), except that there are not separate `src` and `include` folders.; + Tests are grouped by class, and put in files such as `CNumerics_tests.cpp`.; + A single test executable is compiled and run, as opposed to a separate test executable for each group of tests.

The use of NVBLAS is secondary and while functionality has been added to make it usable, it is not activated as it doesn't cause an appreciative increase in performance. ## Compilation and Usage. Compile using the following MESON Flag; ```; -Denable-cuda=true; ```; And activate the functions using the following Config File Option; ```; ENABLE_CUDA=YES; ```. ## NOTE ON IMPLEMENTATION. I've decided to go with a single version of the code where the CPU and GPU implementations co-exist in the same linear solver and can be disabled or switched using a combination of Meson and Config File options. This is why I have defined three classes - one over-arching class that is named CExecutionPath that has two child classes - CCpuExecution and CGpuExecution. These child classes contain the correct member function for each path - CPU or GPU functioning. . All of this could also be easily achieved with an if statement that switches between the two - but that particular implementation will access and run the statement for each call. In our case once a Matrix Vector Product object is created, it will immediately know whether to use CPU or GPU mode of execution. . Recommendations are most welcome to improve or make this implementation better. ## PR Checklist. Warning Levels do come (only at level 3) but they are all of the following type. ```; style of line directive is a GCC extension; ```.

Using absolute cauchy convergence is more robust in this case. At the same time, I understand that a more complex input / more parameters might confuse users. An automatic switch, as propsed in this pull request, is a good compromise. The code now switches automatically to absolut cauchy convergence if the coefficient is < 0.1 to avoid the problem described above. The config file is unchanged. .

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; *Give a brief overview of your contribution here in a few sentences.*; ; This PR greatly improves the robustness and convergence behavior of the flow solvers by implementing a more sophisticated controller for nonlinear iterations along with several other important modifications. The changes are the following:; - New under-relaxation strategy. Variables such as density and energy are only allowed to change by +/- 20% with each nonlinear iteration by applying an under-relaxation parameter to the updates at each node, which helps with difficult transients, especially at calculation startup. Also applied to turbulence model updates (though threshold is larger).; - CFL adaption via an exponential progression with under-relaxation approach, i.e., changes to CFL are coupled to the under-relaxation parameter (small under-relaxation parameter = decrease, and large = increase). CFL is now locally defined for each CV for this process.; - Modified realizability checks to avoid negative density/pressure/temperature at the nodes and also during 2nd-order reconstruction at cell faces.; - CV face states for 2nd-order MUSCL are now optionally reconstructed with a separate gradient method (unweighted least squares recommended), which is very important for robustness. Gradients for viscous terms and sources are still computed via GG or WLS for accuracy reasons.; - SA model was being clipped unnecessarily. This clipping has been removed. Here is my recommendation on how to run all of your 2nd-order cases going forward:. ### Euler / Laminar N-S; Turn off the limiters, unless you truly need them for preserving solution monotonicity (e.g., for shocks/discontinuities). Use ; ```; NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON= LEAST_SQUARES; ```; for robustness. Start with a CFL around 10 and converge the implicit system with LINEAR_SOLVER_ITER= 10 for each nonlinear iteration (FGMRES + ILU0 recommended).

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; Added CMake build support for SU2. With this, many popular IDEs will be able to use SU2 as a project with minimal setup. CMake also enables to add dependencies more easily since most libraries have CMake support. `vcpkg` is great for the libraries available there. SU2 CMake has the same build options as autotools but uses CMake to find system libraries and compilers (MKL, Mutationpp, MPI and Python currently). No longer need to specify paths to compilers/libraries if they are in standard locations. In addition, compile flags can be modified from CMake. There is no need to use `preconfigure.py` anymore since downloading/unpacking is handled by CMake and is system-agnostic. At the moment, all library targets are static but that could be easily changed to be configurable from CMake. The installation directory is `${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}/bin`. Similarly to autotools, some build options are disabled if built with Codi forward/reverse datatypes or without MPI. Note that SWIG fails to compile `pySU2ad` with `Nothing known about namespace 'medi'` in `Common/include/mpi_structure.hpp:57` without `-includeall` SWIG option but then it takes forever to generate the wrapper (more than 15 minutes on my machine, stopped early). I suggest removing `using namespace` declarations and either importing used symbols explicitly with `using` or prepending namespace name, `clang-tidy` warns against them and it makes the code clearer. SU2 CMake options are:; * Build modules:; * `SU2_BUILD_CFD`: `ON|OFF`; * `SU2_BUILD_DEF`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi; * `SU2_BUILD_DOT`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi forward; * `SU2_BUILD_GEO`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi; * `SU2_BUILD_MSH`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi; * `SU2_BUILD_PY_WRAPPER`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi forward; * `SU2_BUILD_SOL`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi; * Enable modules:; * `SU2_ENABLE_CGNS`: ; * `SU2_CGNS_CPPFLAGS`: flags to pas",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814:269,avail,available,269,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814,2,"['avail', 'down']","['available', 'downloading']"

Introduce a way to create different limiters by defining small details like the limiter function (and its associated constants), or any geometry-based modification.

The code probably could be nicer and it could be better documented, but I already forgot some details and it most likely would still be a mess to understand.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi all,. this PR removes all trailing whitespaces from `.cpp` `.hpp` `.inl` `.py` `.build ` files using ; `find . -type f -name '*.cpp' -exec sed --in-place 's/[[:space:]]\+$//' {} \+`; in the code root. and all tabs are replaced by 2 spaces for `.cpp` `.hpp` `.inl` files using; `find . -name '*.cpp' ! -type d -exec bash -c 'expand -t 2 ""$0"" > /tmp/e && mv /tmp/e ""$0""' {} \;`; This step of course can lead some misalignment if the person introducing the tab did not have tabs rendered as 2 spaces (e.g. 4 spaces per tab). This is up of course for discussion and can be seen as a test vehicle to get everyones discussion. One can try to merge this to check if merge conflicts are really that bad to handle. Of course there will be conflicts on lines you touched as well. A possible solution to merge conflicts is to apply the commands to your filebase and then merge... then it is quite likely that your only merge conflicts are the ones you have with develop anyway. The rough plan discussed with @talbring is to include automatic checking of trailing whitespaces, tabs, overlong lines and possibly other stuff. .

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi all,; ; a wrong index (iZone vs iInst) caused the SU2_SOL module to segfault if nZone > nInst. The geometry container is called with the wrong index in the `CBaseLineSolver::LoadRestart` routine. In SU2_SOL.cpp `&geometry_container[iZone][INST_0]` to `geometry_container[iZone]` are interchangeable, I just thought the 2nd formulation is used more often throughout the code. I cannot guarante though that it now runs for multiple instances, but as far as I know there is no such testcase. Testcase: The PR does not come with a Testcase which would catch the error in the future. In testcases started with parallel_computation.py the SU2_SOL module is called and fails for multizone cases (e.g. Jones_rst.cfg which I tested on) but if the residuals fit the case passes. That circumstance is not tackled in this PR but I heard that this is a know issue. I briefly chatted with @rsanfer about that and I offer my help if this is approached. . Additionally I fixed an error message to contain the correct config-option and added a --disable-tecio option to the preconfigure.py script as it is convenient for me as I build on compute nodes which cannot access the necessary X11 libraries and I couldn't get it to work with tecio enabled :( .

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi everyone, . I have found some inconsistencies with respect to the literature on the implementation of the Menter's SST model. I would like to use this branch as test bench for any corrections/improvements made to the SST model. Implementation errors found:; - Use of production limiter constant in the clipping of the cross-diffusion term for the computation of the F1 blending function in CTurbSSTVariable.cpp. ; - SST naming conventions (V in V2003m should stay for Vorticity production term.). Not yet assessed.; - Wrong cross-diffusion term included into the residual of w in turb_sources.hpp. It should not be only the positive value as considered in the computation of the F1 blending function. As stated in https://doi.org/10.2514/3.12149. ""CDkw is the; positive portion of the cross-diffusion term in Eq (A2)"" pag. 1604. Moreover, a clipping has been introduced for large negative values of this term, as suggested in Peng, Shia-Hui, Peter Eliasson, and Lars Davidson. ""Examination of the shear stress transport assumption with a low-Reynolds number k-omega model for aerodynamic flows."" Eq 17.; - Boundary conditions errors at inlets, following the Issue #1851. A fix has been proposed following @pcarruscag suggestions for the supersonic inlet BC.; - Boundary conditions definitions are different than the ones proposed in TMR. Maybe give the user the choice to use the BCs implemented in SU2 or the ones from TMR. Changes to SST model proposed:; - Inclusion of non modified versions of SST. In this case I think that more work is needed to be sure that the correct terms are taken into account everywhere in the code.; - Give the user the possibility of changing the production limiter for TKE (not essential).; - Change values of default turbulent to laminar viscosity to 1e-2 (NASA TMR reports that it should be in the range of 1e-2 to 1e-5, but in SU2 this is set to 10 as default). .

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi everyone,. I have been working on the implementation of the DDES formulations for the SST model, following the work in ""Development of DDES and IDDES Formulations for the k-ω Shear Stress Transport Model"" (DOI:10.1007/s10494-011-9378-4). The implementation is easy, whereas the validation may take some time. I am currently working on the backward facing step and I will work on the flatplate too. The choice of the validation test cases is key since the computational cost is quite large, thus if you have any suggestions that may speed up this part then feel free to write them down. . Implemented versions:; - SST-DDES; - SST-IDDES; - SST-SIDDES. I am also working on the Scale Adaptive Simulations (SAS) implementations for SST, following the work in ""ON URANS SOLUTIONS WITH LES-LIKE BEHAVIOUR"", Travis et al., and ""[Evaluation of scale-adaptive simulation for transonic cavity flows"", Babu et al., (https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJESMS.2016.075510). The last one, especially, is quite tricky due to the computation of the velocity laplacian. I tried computing it in Paraview as the divergence of the gradient field and it seems quite similar, but it is the first time that I've touched that section of the code, thus some work might still be needed. Implemented versions:; - SST-SAS_Simple (better naming is necessary), from the article of Travis et al.; - SST-SAS_Complicated (better naming is necessary), it is related to the article from Babu et al. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; I found two bugs that lead to crashes when trying to restart a shape optimization problem:. 1. The python code still uses the deprecated `has_key` function for dicts.; 2. If the default config file is used in the python scripts, then the aerodynamic coefficients aren't saved anywhere even if `aerodynamics` is called. You can reproduce the bugs using the following MWE:. #### Minimal working example. As per the documentation, you should be able to restart a previous shape optimization problem with a command like:; ```; python shape_optimization.py -f turb_SA_RAE2822.cfg -r project.pkl; ```; where the `-r` command specifies a pickle files with the saved project state from a previous run. I checked the problem on the [RAE2822 constrained optimization tutorial](https://su2code.github.io/tutorials/Turbulent_2D_Constrained_RAE2822/). You can download the files using the instructions on that page. In order to reproduce the bug, run the following chain of commands:. 1. As per the tutorial, run `SU2_GEO turb_SA_RAE2822.cfg`; 2. Modify the `turb_SA_RAE2822.cfg` file to specify that `OPT_ITERATIONS=1`; 3. Run `python $SU2_RUN/shape_optimization.py -f turb_SA_RAE2822.cfg`; 4. Modify the `turb_SA_RAE2822.cfg` file to specify that `OPT_ITERATIONS=2`; 5. Run `python $SU2_RUN/shape_optimization.py -f turb_SA_RAE2822.cfg -r project.pkl`. ## Remaining work. This should be covered by a test case. The problem I used takes a bit of time to compute, even using just the restart. Is there an cheaper shape optimization problem that could run quickly as a test case?. ## Related Work; None. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; In a previous PR the SST model implementation in the CTurbSSTSolver was corrected to use the vorticity magnitude to calculate the turbulent viscosity (mu_T). But this change was not copied in the relevant numerics class where mu_T is used to calculate production terms. This is probably going to break all the SST related regression tests, so I will ensure convergence of those cases and update regression values. ; ; ## Related Work; A relevant discussion to have here is whether to update the SST turbulence model according to a 2003 paper by Menter (author of the SST model): [Ten years of industrial experience with the SST turbulence model](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.460.2814&rep=rep1&type=pdf). It involves tiny changes to coefficients, production limits, and uses strain magnitude instead of the vorticity magnitude to calculate mu_T. The last point means reversing the change that this PR is making. But currently the model is just inconsistent and needs to be corrected. . The changes are supposed to make the model more stable, which has been a cause for concern with the SST model before.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; Similar to the quasi-Newton acceleration provided by `CQuasiNewtonInvLeastSquares`, the proposed toolbox class `CNewtonUpdateOnSubspace` performs a correction on adjoint solution updates by keeping track of past iterates. Here, they are used to identify eigenvectors with large eigenvalues which slow down the overall convergence and to form a (small) subspace basis from them. Each fixed-point solution update is then [projected onto that subspace and the projected part will be additionally corrected via a ""real"" Newton step (a.k.a. ""RPM"")](https://doi.org/10.1137/0730057) using the computational graph for precise derivative information. This preliminary result with one basis vector indicates that the procedure can be effective at very low additional cost (for n basis vectors, it mainly reduces to n scalar products of the current fixed-point iterate with the basis vectors, the Newton step is cheap as n is small).

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; The current PR serves two purposes. First, it extends the sliding interface capabilities for multi-zone fluid-fluid interfaces to incompressible flows. Until now, these features were only available for compressible flows. For example, take the following case of a viscous flow enclosed by diathermal walls and discretized using two different zones with a permeable, non-matching interface:. ![testcase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8706821/51894668-b6cee100-23a8-11e9-8ee8-4b3d846417b2.png); ![discretization](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8706821/51894939-5e4c1380-23a9-11e9-8acb-8ac04d555e2b.png).

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; This PR adds a regression testing pipeline based on the new Github actions features (https://github.com/su2code/SU2/actions). It uses docker containers for building and running the tests (https://hub.docker.com/r/su2code/build-su2 and https://hub.docker.com/r/su2code/test-su2, respectively, based on Ubuntu18.04/gcc7.4/OpenMPI2). This has several advantages over the current (Travis based) system:. - Using the containers you can run the building/testing environment locally on your machine. You can even download the compiled binaries produced on github and run them locally to further debug problems.; - It is faster and more flexible. Compiling and running all tests requires ~1h since a lot of things run in parallel now (e.g. building the base, reverse AD and forward AD binaries). There is potential to further speed things up by splitting the test case scripts into several files. All of that requires minimal work. Unfortunately there is no caching using ccache at the moment, but it is likely that github introduces this feature mid of november. ; - Additional tests like unit tests can make use of the same docker containers and can be easily set up by creating a new workflow file.; - We can easily add a deployment step to automatically create releases and/or nightly builds. **Note:** the linked docker containers are **only** for development/testing purposes. Hence we cannot give any support in this regard. For production use it is recommended to use singularity containers. But: the docker containers can be used as basis layers for singularity. I will get back with more information on that topic. ~~I had to change regression test values of two cases since apparently they are compiler dependent.~~ I changed it to the same versions as we have on Travis.

The reasons for these additions are; - The Piperno limiter is implemented in Inria's Wolf solver and seems to be used in a lot of their mesh adaptation work (see these references for [Euler](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02378738v2/document) and [RANS](https://hal.inria.fr/tel-01962318/file/these_archivage_3570223.pdf)); - Some preliminary tests with the Piperno limiter have converged solutions on triangulated BL meshes that @jayantmukho and I couldn't get to converge with other limiters in SU2 (e.g. triangulated DSMA661 meshes from TMR); - The MUSCL parameter exists in other solvers (FUN3D, CFL3D, Wolf) and is used by the NASA codes for many of the TMR cases (e.g. CFL3D uses 1/3 and FUN3D uses 1/2 for the DSMA661 case).

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; This PR fixes a couple issues in the nonlinear adaptive CFL scheme. - Convergence of the linear solver was assumed if the residual was greater than 0.5, which is quite large. I replaced this with the linear solver tolerance.; - The sum of nonlinear residuals was never computed for steady since `TimeIter` was used.; - The under-relaxation parameters for the flow solver and turbulent solver both took the min of each other and were never reset for steady, meaning it was non-increasing. @jayantmukho and I wanted to discuss more possible improvements to the scheme. I wanted to open this up before making any actual changes. - Currently there is a check for stalling residuals (the sum over 100 iterations of delta_Res must be > 0.1 Res), but this doesn't protect against increasing residuals. We should implement another check to prevent divergence.; - Instead of computing a single local CFL for flow/turbulence with a reduction factor for turbulence, maybe it would be better to have both solvers make their own call to `AdaptCFLNumber` and compute their own local CFL based on their own ResRMS.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; This PR is about the implementation of a rough wall boundary condition for SA and SST models. A given realistic roughness distribution must be first converted to an ""equivalent sand grain roughness"" height and specified as an input. . For the SA turbulence model, the roughness boundary condition is based on:. Aupoix, B. and Spalart, P. R., ""Extensions of the Spalart-Allmaras Turbulence Model to Account for Wall Roughness,"" International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow, Vol. 24, 2003, pp. 454-462. . Very briefly, the new model assumes there is a ""virtual wall"" located on top of the roughness elements and thus the distance to nearest wall is modified for all points based on the specified sand grain roughness. Additionally, the boundary condition at the wall is now not set to zero but a mixed condition (robin BC) is applied allowing for a non-zero eddy viscosity at the wall. More information is also available [here](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/spalart.html#sarough). For the SST model, the roughness boundary condition is based on:. Wilcox, D.C Turbulence Modeling for CFD., 1998 and 2006, DWC Industries. There are two suggestions (first in the 2nd edition and a corrected version in the 3rd edition).

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; This is a little improvement to the multipoint optimization setup. Currently if you want to run multipoint optimization with restarts, the python scripts only keep track of one restart file (the first of the multipoint conditions). This is acceptable when the multipoint conditions are similar, but does not work when the conditions are very different. For example, if one point is supersonic and the other is subsonic, and the subsonic case is restarted from the supersonic solution, it immediately diverges. . This PR allows the python scripts to keep track of restarts for each point in the multipoint set up. It is robust in the sense that you can start with 0 restart files or some subset of restart files. For example, if you are running a 3 point optimization but only have the restart for one of the points, this will handle that case by starting the other two points from scratch, but keeping track of the restart files after the first design iteration. There is a naming convention that is presumed. The restarts get 'point#' added to its base name. So for example, if the SOLUTION_FILENAME= solution_flow.dat then it will look for files named solution_flow_point0.dat, solution_flow_point1.dat and so on. For adjoints this is solution_adj_point0_cd.dat etc. This naming convention can be tweaked according to comments. . ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; This is a tiny PR to add a conditional operator in CFlowOutput.cpp to avoid calling to GetNodes() function if the solver is a FEM/DG solver. In one of the early commits (34b0464e898dd167d8a865f47aa630019a5978ac), a call to GetNodes() was added in `CFlowOutput::SetAnalyzeSurface` which calls the function `GetNodes()`. ```const auto flow_nodes = solver[FLOW_SOL]->GetNodes();```. There is an assertion in `GetNodes()` that further mandates the `CVariable` `base_nodes` to be set properly. However, in the FEM/DG solver, the `base_nodes` is defaulted to `nullptr` and we have workarounds in the FEM/DG sovler that does not require a call to `GetNodes()` in other parts of the code (we use elements instead of nodes, so the concept of nodes is not really well-defined in the FEM/DG solver). . At the moment, the develop branch will fail at this line if anyone attempts to use the FEM/DG solver. . E.g., Taking the `hom_euler/NACA0012_5thOrder` test case in the repo gives the following error message:; ```SU2_CFD: ../SU2_CFD/src/output/../../include/solvers/CSolver.hpp:230: const CVariable* CSolver::GetNodes() const: Assertion `base_nodes!=nullptr && ""CSolver::base_nodes was not set properly, see brief for CSolver::SetBaseClassPointerToNodes()""' failed.``` at the pre-processing stage before any computation is done.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; This is the initial PR for a long overdue refactorization of the mesh deformation routines. The mesh deformation acquires here a full ""solver"" status, and uses the FEA Elasticity classes as its basis. The pseudo-linear elastic solver now always refers to the initial, undeformed geometrical discretization, therefore ensuring that the problem remains traceable to the original mesh, and that when volumes are computed to deform the mesh, the initial quality of the elements is observed. . With this framework, the wall distances only need to be computed once for distance-based stiffness, and the stiffness matrix is now symmetric after applying BCs so conjugate gradient can be used to compute the mesh deformation. The adjoint sensitivities can now be propagated down to the surface mesh points without the need to use DOT, although further work is needed to propagate them to the FFD points or other DV of choice. I tried to keep config options simple: the new mesh solver is enabled using; ` DEFORM_MESH = YES `; and the relevant markers which will move and introduce deformations into the domain are set using; `MARKER_DEFORM_MESH= ( wall )`; Hopefully, previous mesh deformation structures can be deprecated and removed soon, but we will need to adapt the rigid/imposed boundary deformation of other kinds of grid movement. I kindly ask for your help in there, as I'm not very familiar with some of the legacy code for this purpose. Additionally, in this PR I have done some refactoring so the AD-based adjoint routines are accessible from the python-wrapped version of the code. The SWIG wrapper now compiles the AD binaries and interfaces directly to sensitivity information, which should make it much easier to integrate SU2 within any python-based optimization framework. . ## Related Work; - Some work will be needed to adapt the new contiguous variable structure by @pcarruscag in #753; - I have added a couple of regression tests, but I will add tutorials once #724 i",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/760:786,down,down,786,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/760,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; To improve robustness of the SU2 code, specifically when using the SST (1994/2003) model, we would like to suggest a slight modification to the lower limits of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and the specific turbulent dissipation rate (Omega). Presently, the lower limits are given as follows:; TKE_LoweLimit = 1E-10; Omega_LowerLimit = 1E-4. Estimating if these lower limits are sufficiently low is very difficult.; They may be too high. This is certainly the case whether one runs in a dimensional or non-dimensional mode. It may be sufficiently low for one mode but marginally low for the second mode. Therefore, we suggest clipping the solution relative to the TKE and Omega freestream values such that:. TKE_LowerLimit = C_k * TKE_infinity; Omega _LowerLimit = C_w * Omega_infinity. Where C_k and C_w are constants. . The control over these constants is given to the user, However based on our 20 years of experience with the k-w models, Omega will not drop below 1E-3 * Omega_infinity (converged solution). However, in the process of convergence, it may reach lower values. Therefore, a value of . C_w = 1E-6. is reasonable. The solution of TKE is not very sensitive to C_K (assume it is sufficiently low). We recommended:. C_K = 1E-20. setting these as default values. . ## Related Work; Results of the change on convergence of VFE2 test case are presented. Two configurations of CFL adaptation were tested on both the original and modified lower limit code, ; 1. CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.99, 1.005, 5.0, 50.0, 0.0001 ) named max CFL 50 ; 2.

Availability,"## Scope; Elasticity problems can be quite demanding linear solver wise as your typical case will have very few Dirichlet boundaries.; Common iterative methods can only go so far, and pseudo time strategies to improve conditioning do not work as well as for fluid problems due to the elliptic nature of the equations.; Scalability is also an issue since most preconditioners get weaker as the problem gets partitioned.; Direct sparse solvers handle these problems just fine, so life is good again, until you run out of RAM that is (which only ever happens in 3D). Time complexity is about O(N^2) and storage O(N^1.5). ## Proposed Changes; Wrapper class for Inria's direct sparse solver [PaStiX](http://pastix.gforge.inria.fr/files/README-txt.html).; Why this solver? Because it is open source, has active development in advanced features like GPU support and compression techniques to reduce memory footprint, and from my experience it is really robust. ## Implementation; As this feature benefits mostly the FSI people (@rsanfer, @cvencro, and me) I tried to keep it as standalone as possible.; The core implementation is in separate files and nothing needs to change in CSysMatrix for this to work. ## Usage; Available factorizations:; - LDLT; - LU; - ILU(k). The ILU is different from the one we have in that it is computed for the entire matrix and not just for the local matrices (i.e. it considers halos), it is not very fast though.; The three factorizations can be used as preconditioners via options PASTIX_ILU, PASTIX_LU, and PASTIX_LDLT. And the first two as solvers via options PASTIX_LU and PASTIX_LDLT (in which case you should use a preconditioner type that does not cause CSysMatrix to allocate extra memory (LU_SGS).; The reason LDLT and LU can also be used as preconditioners is that it is possible to set a factorization frequency (via PASTIX_FACTORIZATION_FREQUENCY) so that the factorizations are only computed every N iterations or only on the first call (frequency set to 0), th",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/771:946,robust,robust,946,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/771,1,['robust'],['robust']

Even the _Constrained shape design of a transonic turbulent airfoil tutorial_ does not work. The required files (_initial solution files for the solver and adjoint solution_flow.dat, solution_adj_cd.dat, and solution_adj_cmz.dat_) are given from the beginning and if they are not added to the path in which the tutorial will be run, it cannot be completed.

However some stability can be lost on meshes with very high aspect ratios, therefore there would be a compile-time switch for this mode and the default would be all doubles (hence the Easter egg designation). This should be relatively easy to do cleanly since the relevant classes are already templated and have ""mixing-type logic"" for when they are used with AD.

By GPU standards these are rookie numbers. **Why should we care about SIMD?**; Because it is the only way to use the whole silicon, by and large vector instructions have the same latency and throughput of their scalar versions, therefore speedups proportional to the number of SIMD lanes are possible in compute-bound code.; As we saw in #716 there is some of that in the numerics, do not expect 4x speed-ups though, low order unstructured FVM is known to be bandwidth-bound, vectorization helps a bit there too (instructions are also data that needs to travel to the CPU) (maybe for explicit schemes and 8 SIMD lanes, maybe). **Relation with data structures**; There is only one efficient way to move data between memory and registers, via `load` and `store` instructions (they do come in multiple flavors). That is, pointing to a memory location and reading or writing N elements of contiguous data.; It is not the only way, it is also possible to `gather` and `scatter` data. That is populating the register from non-contiguous locations and vice versa. This is about one order of magnitude slower, to the point where if the computations are very simple it may not pay-off to vectorize. **Relation with algorithms**; Some form of `gather` and `scatter` is required in unstructured CFD, which means SIMD has a price of admission. Some thought needs to go into designing algorithms that amortize that cost by maximizing the so called FLOP/Byte ratio, and mask the latency of those operations by being able to start computing as soon ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-529662724:402,avail,available,402,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-529662724,2,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"### Preamble. I am moving the discussion about SIMD that started in #716 here and adding hybrid parallelization.; The two topics go hand in hand since both (SPMD and SIMD) consist of processing multiple data (MD) elements simultaneous, either by a single program (SP) that is run by multiple threads (generally with shared view of memory), or by a single instruction (SI) run by a single core.; The reason SIMD came up in #716 is that, as I will demonstrate, vectorization needs to be supported by data structures. On the other hand SPMD needs to be supported by algorithms designed to avoid race conditions, two or more threads modifying the same memory location. Instead of continuing #716 I think it is better to let that become documentation for #753.; I did not add **without loss of readability** to the title because it is long as is, that requirement is present nonetheless.; I open these issues in the hope that people participate (I am not a fast writer so this is actually a lot of work) and so far great comments and insights have come from those with experience in these topics (kudos to @economon and @vdweide). But please participate even if you never heard of these topics, your opinion about readability and ""developability"" of the code is important! I think the code-style should be accessible to people starting a PhD (after they read a bit about C++...). My (ambitious) goal with this work is to lay down an architecture for performance, i.e. not just to improve the performance of a few key numerical schemes but to create mechanisms applicable to all existing and future ones. Moreover I want that to be possible with minimal changes to the way those bits of code are currently written.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789:1420,down,down,1420,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789,1,['down'],['down']

I've implemented this in the structural solver as a preprocessing step. For each surface element of all FSI markers an average stress is computed based on its nodal values, it is then integrated in current (deformed) coordinates. A second pass over the elements scatters the force on the element to the nodes, this is to account for nodes that participate in multiple markers.; The mechanism by which the structural solver takes the flow tractions and updates the Residual vector was not changed, so this changes are fairly local.; The only downside I see is that knowledge of whether the interpolation is consistent or conservative is now required in two locations...

Availability,") then a good approach is to ; 1. make your `enum` of choice an `enum class` and remove the associated numbers. ; 2. Rename here if reasonable, i,.e. `ENUM_INLET_TYPE` can be just `INLET_TYPE`. Also the option names to not be redundant so e.g. `INLET_TYPE::PRESSURE_INLET_TYPE` could become `INLET_TYPE::PRESSURE`; 3. Add a `NONE` or `NO_THING` option if needed. Often the global `NONE` option is and that made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move 🧙 ; 2. then you go to `CConfig.c/hpp` and change the option type and everything there (because in the `CConfig` class the variable is usually defined). Find the `GetKind_yourOption` and search the code base for that `Get` function.; 3. Once all search results and the following function bodies are changed just compile and fix until the code builds; 4. Special care for switch statements: If not all options are present make a `default; break;` line -> otherwise the automated builds will fail on a warning (clang is used, I found gcc does only complain with an additional flag); 4. commit at best just 1 commit with a clear message and push.

You will have to bear with me, I might get some of this wrong, I am not entirely sure what is going on here so I will try and include as much information as possible. Using the tape tagging method developed by @oleburghardt in #2343 and presented at the most recent SU2 Conference, a run of the full tape reveals that a variable used in a preaccumulation output is not properly recorded. The variable is the `val` in the function `PassiveAssign` in `CSysMatrix.hpp` line 215. `FORCEINLINE static ScalarType PassiveAssign(const SrcType& val) {; return SU2_TYPE::GetValue(val);; }`. Following the call stack of the error reveals that the problem variables in `val` are the jacobian components calculated in the Roe and JST scheme (these are the two options I have tested). It is possible to resolve this error by simply moving the stopping of the preaccumulation region from before the call to `updateLinearSystem` in the `ComputeFlux` method of both these schemes, to after, as show below. `/*--- Update the vector and system matrix. ---*/. updateLinearSystem(iEdge, iPoint, jPoint, implicit, updateType,; updateMask, flux, jac_i, jac_j, vector, matrix);. /*--- Stop preaccumulation. ---*/. stopPreacc(flux);`. However, whilst this resolve the error in this location, the next error appears in the Giles boundary condition. Here the two jacobian components within the residual object are not recorded correctly in the preaccumulation output region also. This in `CEulerSolver.cpp:6556`. `/*--- Compute the residual using an upwind scheme ---*/; auto residual = conv_numerics->ComputeResidual(config);. /*--- Update residual value ---*/; LinSysRes.AddBlock(iPoint, residual);`. I have tried simpy adding these components as preacc outputs however they are SIMD arrays and the datatype cannot be converted using the existing implementation. . I am not sure what is going on here, or the next steps to resolve this problem.

Hi all,. The STL-file writer does not write quad surface elements (So far so good :) ). So in case of a Hexa-Grid (i.e. quad surface elements) the .stl is pretty much empty, which is not really what we want.; I will attach an image later (firewall's at it again) down below which shows a mixed surface mesh (tris and quads). On the left will be the current version of SU2 where quads are simply not written and on the right a fixed version where each quad is separated into 2 tris. ![stl_quads_tris](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31306376/58827759-17667700-8644-11e9-9e6f-4643d2e7fdb7.JPG). That was found (and fixed) by Fabian Woerenkaemper @ElGarno . As the output is currently overhauled, I shortly chatted with its adoptive father @talbring and I will adapt the fixed STL-writer to the new structure and it will (hopefully) go into develop with that in a somewhat near future. If you desperately ;) need that fix right now, I can add a patch for the current develop down below.

The problem disappears if I use smaller number of cores, e.g. 64, and everything will look normal (solution converges and SU2 exit normally). The actual number of MPI cores that triggers the bug seems to be problem dependent. I also ran a couple of finer grids but started to see the bug with 64 cores. For these finer mesh, reducing to a smaller number like 48 cores makes the problem disappear again. Similar problem has been observed by @clarkpede and mentioned in pecos-hybrid/su2#53 but he was using an older version of SU2 (v6.2.0).

Availability,"**Describe the bug**; *Reference case and expectations*; After many, many tries, the Caradonna-Tung test case seems to ""converge"" towards a non-physical solution. The flow creates a vortex around the blade instead of generating a downward jet as one can expect (https://www.nas.nasa.gov/SC08/v22_2.html). The case simulates a propeller with a compressible Euler solver. *Main issue*; The outlet, pressure outlet, or farfield boundary conditions seems to destabilize after some iterations due to the high speed gradient on the outlet face. To get into more details, there is a vortex forming ring forming near of the outlet creating a inflow at the center. The BC seems to build on this inflow up to a point where the flow destabilizes the solution and diverges or pushes the flow to make a ring around the propeller. *Case setup and context*; To put some context the current case tries to simulate the flow-field generated by a blade/propeller in a hover state in order to compute the thrust. The blade is surrounded by a cylinder. The markers for each surfaces are:; -""inlet"" for the top of the cylinder; -""farfield"" for the sides of the cylinder; -""outlet"" for the bottom of the cylinder. The blade has been divided into 4 surfaces which have the following self explanatory marker names:; - ""propellerUpperSurface""; - ""propellerLowerSurface""; - ""propellerRightTip""; - ""propellerLeftTip"". Many combinations of the possible boundary conditions setup were tested for the ""inlet"", ""farfield"" and ""outlet"" markers. Furthermore the Inlet BC were tried with many different vertical speeds (vx=0/0.001/0.01/0.1/1/10). Simulations with the inlet, farfield and outlet as TOTAL_INLET, FARFIELD, OUTLET and EULER and some (not all) combination between these BC were tried. The mesh was generated with Salome-Meca.

Availability,"**Describe the bug**; Certain meshes seem to get stuck at Geometry Preprocessing: Checking the numerical grid orientation. It will remain stuck indefinitely (I've only left it for up to 20 hours, however). This has only happened to prism meshes that I've generated with Pointwise's T-Rex function. However, it only seems to affect some of them. I should mention that the geometry has a very sharp and flat wingtip - sometimes the final few cells on the wingtip become 2D flat plates rather than 3D cells. Will SU2 handle these? I notice that not all meshes with 2D tips get stuck, but all the meshes that are stuck are meshes with 2D tips. (i.e. some meshes seem to run fine.). I'm not sure if this is a bug or user error but I've also attached some images to demonstrate what I mean.

Availability,"**Describe the bug**; I am reading the source code of SU2 V7.3.1, and I find the UnitNormal vector computed in BC_Sym_Plane(...) is different with other BCs such as Far Field, Inlet and so on, so I think the UnitNormal in BC_Sym_Plane is doubtful. At line 1135 in ""SU2_CFD/include/solvers/CFVMFlowSolverBase.inl"", the Normal vector has been negated for outward convention. While at line 1141, the UnitNormal vector is computed as:. UnitNormal [iDim]= -Normal[iDim] / Area,. where the UnitNormal vector is actually negated again, though the Normal vector is negated once and outward. And then this double-negated UnitNormal vector is employed to the whole computation of Symmetry BC, which will induce error to the ""ProjVelocity_i (line 1209)"" as well as ""V_reflected (1217)"" vector. In other BCs, the UnitNormal vector is negated only once.

Changing the LINEAR_SOLVER_PREC sometimes helps. In this flatplate case ILU does better but for other simulations this stalling will persist. Adaptive CFL will almost certainly mess things up (even #790). Sidenote, is there a rule of thumb for which LINEAR_SOLVER_PREC and LINEAR_SOLVER to use?. **To Reproduce**; This was on the basic flatplate test case that is available with the repo.

I used the SU2_CFD module to verify whether the optimized model really reduces drag with more volume mesh. I got a nice result. Compared to the original model, the optimized model has reduced drag. But when the same grids, original model grid and optimized model grid, is used for numerical simulation in Fluent, I got a bad result. there is almost no drag reduction, and drag, lift and pitching moment are all smaller than SU2.

Availability,"*If this is a general question or difficulty building/using the code, please open a ""Discussion"" instead.*. **Describe the bug**; Not really a bug, but compiler warnings that can be avoided easily. In the file SU2_CFD/include/numerics/NEMO/NEMO_diffusion.hpp, class CAvgGradCorrected_NEMO, the variables iDim and iVar are defined, which are used as counters as far as I can tell. First of all I don't think such variables should not be defined as member variables of a class, but if you do then don't define variables with the same name in the implementation of the member functions. In this case in SU2_CFD/src/numerics/NEMO/NEMO_diffusion.cpp. It is causing a lot of compiler warnings in combination with the Intel compiler, which makes it more difficult to see the warnings that actually matter. If you want I can fix this, but maybe it is better if somebody with a NEMO background does it. **Bug report checklist**; *Please make sure that you have followed the checklist below, many common problems can be solved by:*. - [X] Consulting the build instructions (https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Build-SU2-Linux-MacOS/).; - [X] Looking for similar problems on GitHub or CFD-Online (https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2/).; - [X] Updating to the newest version of SU2 (either develop, master, or the pre-built executables https://su2code.github.io/download.html). **Desktop (please complete the following information):**; - OS: Ubuntu 20.04; - C++ compiler and version: Intel compilers version 19.1.0.166; - MPI implementation and version: Intel MPI; - SU2 Version: develop branch",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1916:1350,down,download,1350,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1916,1,['down'],['download']

Availability,", 2019, at 2:14 PM, Clark Pederson <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>> wrote:. I propose adding a unit-testing framework and unit-tests to SU2. After chatting with @economon<https://github.com/economon>, I've decided to move the discussion here to get additional input. What is unit testing?. For those not familiar with unit testing, unit testing allows the testing of small bits of behavior, ideally using isolated bits of code. It is not intended to replace validation testing or formal verification tests. Instead, it serves a unique purpose. Consider the three following use cases:. * You're developing a new feature, and you want to test it to see if it works. You could do a full simulation, but that takes a lot of time and computing power. You want to check if your new behavior behaves as you suspect before you throw a lot of resources at it.; * You submit a PR and discover that one of the regression tests has failed. But...why? You know that something is broken, but its hard to track down what broke. You want more granular test coverage that can demonstrate what broke.; * You are fixing a very small bug. You know that you should prove that your bug fix worked, but it doesn't seem logical to dedicate an entire validation case to one small bug fix. You want to write a small test for a small fix. In all of these cases, unit testing fills a unique role. Unit testing increases time spent in development, but decreases the amount of time spent in bug-fixing and maintaining. For more information, see this relevant Stack Exchange question.<https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/206/is-it-worthwhile-to-write-unit-tests-for-scientific-research-codes>. What do I propose?. My research group at UT Austing has implemented a unit testing framework on our branch, which we're happy with. Some choices were arbitrary, and some choices were made based on our development environment. Those choices may be different for other groups. Here's what we have done:.

Availability,". Start with a CFL around 10 and converge the implicit system with LINEAR_SOLVER_ITER= 10 for each nonlinear iteration (FGMRES + ILU0 recommended). Activate the CFL adaption with. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down, factor up, CFL min value,; % CFL max value ); CFL_ADAPT= YES; CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.1, 2.0, 10.0, 1e10); ```. It is important that the linear solve behaves well for each nonlinear iteration, so if this does not converge immediately, adjust the tolerance or number of linear iterations. Roe seems very stable, but some of the other upwind schemes or centered schemes may require improved Jacobian accuracy (to recover fast convergence) with:. ```; USE_ACCURATE_FLUX_JACOBIANS= YES; CENTRAL_JACOBIAN_FIX_FACTOR= 4.0; ```. ### RANS; Due to the segregated approach for the turbulence models, you have to be more conservative with the CFL adaption. All else is the same as above, but I recommend. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down, factor up, CFL min value,; % CFL max value ); CFL_ADAPT= YES; CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.1, 1.2, 10.0, 1e3); ```. Most inviscid/laminar cases that I have tested so far converge to machine precision within a couple of hundred iterations. RANS cases within a few thousand. Ultra fine RANS meshes can still slow things down (MG could help there), but otherwise, speedups of an order of magnitude (or more) are possible for most problems. Experiment yourselves.. sometimes you can get even more performance, sometimes less, case depending. I could use help testing this one with your cases, since I think almost all regression tests will change. As a start, I have run all of the NASA TMR 2D bump-in-channel cases. Everything looks good with that (see figures).

Availability,"..654ba3dfc207e25c31da9c09860224ad4044a610), which was the original branch merged in #724. . Unfortunately, given that during this time both #753 and #774 were merged, the tests are failing now. Particularly, the disc_adj_fsi case runs into a segfault in `CDiscAdjSolver::ExtractAdjoint_CrossTerm_Geometry`, when trying to execute ; `geometry->node[iPoint]->GetAdjointCoord(Solution_Geometry);`. . I believe this is related to the changes to the index based recording introduced in #774, as the code was running before into the same problem in `CDiscAdjSolver::ExtractAdjoint_CrossTerm`, and now goes beyond this point having changed the Get routine into `direct_solver->GetNodes()->GetAdjointSolution_intIndexBased(iPoint,Solution);`. Currently, there is no `GetAdjointCoord_intIndexBased` or similar available, and its implementation requires some constructs for the indices. Therefore, I would like to ask for support from @oleburghardt and @pcarruscag to make this work with their changes. ## Related Work; #724 involuntarily removed the discrete adjoint FSI cases from the regression tests.; Branch [fix_discadjfsi](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/fix_discadjfsi) successfully recovers the functionality removed.; #774 introduced relevant changes to the adjoint solver that are making.; #753 was merged and, although I tried to adapt to it, I can't guarantee it's working correctly. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

The critical part of this error seems to be the Error in TokenizeString() message, suggesting an issue with parsing the configuration file. This error typically indicates a syntax problem, such as having multiple options on a single line without proper separation by an equal sign (=). However, upon reviewing _adap/ini/config_CFD.cfg_, was unable to find any lines that clearly violated this syntax rule. Could this error be indicative of a more subtle issue within the configuration file, or might it be related to specific aspects of the feature_adap branch? Any insights, suggestions, or guidance on how to troubleshoot this error would be greatly appreciated. If anyone has a working adapt_mesh.cfg file for a similar setup or for the feature_adap branch, I would be very interested in seeing it. Understanding the configuration details of a working example could be highly beneficial in resolving my issue.

Availability,"/how-to-check-if-python3-was-built-with-enable-shared), in the python shell you can type ; `import sysconfig`; `sysconfig.get_config_vars('Py_ENABLE_SHARED')`; If the result is `[0]`, ie ""False"", you have to build python with the option `--enable-shared`. ; Now, I don't know how to do accomplish that with conda, but with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) it involves installing the desired python version with `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install <version>`. To recap, a ""workflow for newbies"" which appears to be working for me is. 1. install pyenv either from [source](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) or from your distibution repositories, if available. IMPORTANT: make sure the environment variables are correctly set and `pyenv init` is added to your shell, as per the installation instructions.; 2. install the desired python version (for example 3.7.8), enabling shared libraries: ; `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install 3.7.8`; 3. clone/download the [feature_adap](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/feature_adap) branch of SU2;; 4. in the SU2 folder, configure meson ; `./meson.py build` ; and make sure to update the environment variables in your `.bashrc` as indicated by meson's output.; 5. use ninja to build and install SU2 ; `./ninja -C build install`;; if you run into a permission error, specify an installation directory passing the `--prefix` option to meson, as explained [here](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2-installation/227676-su-installation-failed-due-insufficient-permissions.html). These passages, at least for me, result in a running SU2 with mesh adaptation, although I have made no tests on running actual simulations. That being said, the involvement of pyenv is due to the fact that the provided python wheel for pyamg is for python 3.7 only. If I understand correctly, the library itself is proprietary, sadly, so I assume @bmunguia has access either to the source files or to someone who can package them.

Then, it should be used ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50565314/148767053-79a012e3-1061-46b9-b432-359b7b04969f.png) in the stress tensor of the momentum and energy equations. The code always ignores the turbulence kinetic energy to compute the stress tensor for the momentum and energy equation.; Is it under maintenance? . Extra question) Someone working to implement for other kinds of SST(like SST-V, SST-Vm, SST-2003, SST-2003m, ... )? .

Thanks. **To Reproduce**; I've attached the mesh and config file in [this link](http",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1156:2669,error,error,2669,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1156,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"6bb299cf3/Common/src/geometry_structure.cpp#L18798>. I've copied down the lines here for reference:. /*--- Change the numbering to guarantee that the all the receive; points are at the end of the file ---*/; unsigned long OldnPoint = geometry->GetnPoint();; unsigned long *NewSort = new unsigned long[nPoint];; for (iPoint = 0; iPoint < nPoint; iPoint++) {; NewSort[iPoint] = iPoint;; }. unsigned long Index = OldnPoint-1;; for (iMarker = 0; iMarker < nMarker; iMarker++) {; if (bound[iMarker][0]->GetVTK_Type() == VERTEX) {; if (config->GetMarker_All_SendRecv(iMarker) < 0) {; for (iElem_Bound = 0; iElem_Bound < nElem_Bound[iMarker]; iElem_Bound++) {; if (bound[iMarker][iElem_Bound]->GetNode(0) < geometry->GetnPoint()) {; NewSort[bound[iMarker][iElem_Bound]->GetNode(0)] = Index;; NewSort[Index] = bound[iMarker][iElem_Bound]->GetNode(0);; Index--;; }; }; }; }; }. In order to sort the points, a list mapping the old points to the new points (NewSort) is created. The problem is that this list is sorted by switching nodes. But it doesn't switch around the contents of the list (i.e. two node numbers from the list). Instead it switched an index from the list and an actual node number pulled from the geometry. This presents two problems:. 1. If any of the receive nodes actually are at the end of the list, they will get switched away from the end of the list.; 2. If any node is switched twice, data is lost. That's because the sorting assumes that the elements being switched have not already been switched. This is how the three points went missing from the cube problem I previously referenced. If my write-up is too confusing, I can provide a play-by-play of how the error occurs. —; You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.; Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/431#issuecomment-358340153>, or mute the thread<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AE_4SuB5X60MCplLjmFeVUIgSigM7xbrks5tLhH_gaJpZM4PE7sn>.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/431#issuecomment-358423989:2368,error,error,2368,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/431#issuecomment-358423989,1,['error'],['error']

Therefore, a hybrid mesh is used on a 2d surface and is extruded along the span. The following pictures represented a global view of the test case, the hybrid mesh and the mesh distribution for the extrusion:. ![global](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24920252/140758176-d1e5da98-5e54-457e-9a80-92878a1e88ba.png); ![2dmesh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24920252/140756176-4560688b-1c6c-42e7-b404-95589764acad.png). ![extrusion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24920252/140756190-d5a423b7-c172-4fff-9fe3-53ed0364756e.png). As we can see, the mesh is refined near the two walls (the hub/shroud) to get a y+ of 1 and here starts my issue. . While I can retrieve a correct y+ near the blade, I have trouble to get a y+ lower than 65 near the walls. At y+ = 65, SU2 runs and converges to some results. For y+ < 65, SU2 raises a segmentation fault at this location: ; ![segfault](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24920252/140756620-db3ed08f-05cd-4811-b037-642a221ea501.png); Here are the results of the gdb analysis.

However, when I use mpi4py 3.1.3, I wasn't able to import the renamed _pysu2.so into python3, the error message is very similar to the one reported with segmentation fault 11. At this point, I think the potential approach is to enable python3 to import *.dylib module extension, since it seems that some *.dylib mpi shared library is also related to this. I tried to link .so extension for libopen-pal.40.dylib but that does not solve the issue. Any suggestion on this? Thank you!.

We could also parallelize the matrix updates without colouring by setting only the off-diagonal coefficients and then setting the diagonal entries to the column sum.; It turns out that this is worse (by about 10%), maybe if the matrix were symmetric (row sum) but a column sum accesses blocks very far apart. Also we want to interleave compute and load/stores as much as possible to allow the CPU pipelining magic to mask the latency of the latter (even if it looks like you can only write the block after it is computed, CPU's have all kinds of buffers that allow the next loop iteration to begin while data is in flight). **Therefore colouring is the way to go.**. _Note: With vectorized numerics we insert blocks for 4 or 8 edges into the matrix at a time, the data for those inserts will be in a slightly weird format, which will make `SparseMatrix::updateBlocks` a bit harder on the eye, more on that later._. ## MUSCL Reconstruction; The MUSCL reconstruction, characteristic of upwind schemes, is the simplest building block to show the (negative) implications of storing the data as structures of arrays (SoA) on the performance of some operations.; Here is the most basic numerics you can think of, reconstruct and average (the dummy matrix loop was to benchmark the writes this is to benchmark the reads); ```c++; void computeResidual(size_t nVar,; size_t nDim,; const vector<size_t>& colorStart,; const vector<size_t>& edgeIdx,; const vector<pair<size_t,si",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-535977206:5090,mask,mask,5090,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-535977206,2,['mask'],['mask']

We have recently introduced the Meson build system (https://mesonbuild.com/) (#685, #745) as a candidate to replace automake. A guide on how to use can be found [here](https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Build-SU2-From-Source/). The idea is that we will have this system along automake at least for the upcoming version 7 and that we get rid of automake afterwards. Considering that, I don't think that it makes sense to maintain 3 different build systems **at the moment**. I really hate turning contributions down, but this one is three months too late. However, we might reconsider adding support for another build system once we got rid of automake, or, if we feel that meson does not fit our needs.; > ; > I am all ears to hear other opinions.

Ok, I tried meson with MinGW but couldn't figure out how to link with MSMPI since it's not a part of MinGW. However, using CMake and with a few source code fixes, I managed to compile nearly every configuration with MSVC. Surprisingly, there were very few errors in SU2.

Availability,"> @kursatyurt Hello, thank you so much for the lead.; > ; > Our initial scope mostly involved writing our own kernels and I did explore some libraries at the start - I was planning on using CUSP as well but my main concern was its lack of being updated to the newly compatible versions of the toolkit. cuSolver and cuBLAS do exist, but I chose to go ahead with a ""simple"" kernel implementation to have more control. I also felt that if I could keep the block size of the grid in optimal territory then they could be just as fast as those options (please do correct me if my reading of the literature or the situation was incorrect). To learn the basics, it's a good idea, but for large-scale projects, I prefer using existing libraries if possible.; Those libraries generally exploit state-of-the-art solution like mixed-precision computing. A gaming GPU is not way faster than a good CPU in double precision, but way faster in single precision, most of them have 64:1 ratio, however server class GPU have 2:1 ratio. Also when available they use vendor libraries like cuBLAS or hipBLAS. It is always nice to have you only care about connection and somebody else handle the solver as performant as possible.

Availability,"> Do I understand correctly that two gradients are always computed per iteration?; > Is there any downside to using the unweighted LS for viscous flux correction? Is the statement that this type of gradient is better for reconstruction based on your observations or is it one of those well known things?. Yes - the gradient for now is computed twice and stored separately for viscous flows with 2nd-order upwind. Could be combined into one loop eventually. It is known that weighted LSQ / GG is more accurate (see Mavriplis, ""Revisiting the Least-Squares Procedure for Gradient Reconstruction on Unstructured Meshes"" for instance). However, unweighted LSQ is known to be more robust.. so a good compromise is to use it only for the reconstruction step (which is more susceptible to robustness issues than the viscous term) and then use WLSQ or GG for all other gradients in the viscous flux/sources for accuracy. > Sometimes high CFL leads to limit-cycle oscillations of the residuals and the solution is to reduce it, is this something this controller can pick up?; > High CFL also makes the linear systems harder to solve and as Edwin pointed out _somewhere_ there is not much point going above reasonable values with weakly coupled turbulence. Do you think it would be reasonable to build in some feedback from the linear solver (e.g. it is taking too much time or did not converge -> drop the CFL)?. Yes, I would also like to couple it to the linear solver so that we can remove the need to tune that as well. Ideally the user will not need to adjust parameters.

So if the the option `ITER_DCL_DALPHA = 0` then it will do exactly what you suggest. It calculates the derivative based on the last update. The only problem with that is, there is no guarantee that the simulation at the previous update was converged, so the derivative might be incorrect. .

So augmented Jacobian matrices are needed. I have gone through the SU2 code of TNE2Solver in version 4.0.1.

Availability,"> In the early days, we thought completely removing CVariable and CNumerics would be very intrusive to change and would hurt flexibility... Over the years, I don't think that folks have really modified the CNumerics classes all that often (once you have implemented the Roe method, it is more or less done). As someone who has worked with the CNumerics classes a lot, I can say that we really don't gain much by keeping them as separate classes. On the surface, it seems like a good use of the [strategy pattern](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/strategy). But from a pragmatic approach, it's not as flexible as OO purists would like you to believe. First off, if you need a new variable in the CNumerics class, you need to change both the solver class and the numerics class, since the solver class calls Setters to set the numerics variables. If you don't call the right Setters, you get a silent failure (unless you're using valgrind). The passing of variables between solver and numerics also leads to a lot of code duplication. And for many solvers (e.g. the viscous NS numerics or the source terms in the SST model) you only end up with one numerics class anyways. I also imagine there's a strong performance hit from all the Setters and copying of variables. But I haven't taken the time to check for myself. In my opinion, you could keep 80% of the current flexibility by using different functions instead of different classes.

Availability,"> SU2 is a fantastic library, but the build process is really painful to get static linking within another C++ program. CMake is a standard for building C++ projects and would be extremely helpful. Ideally Python wouldn't be necessary to build SU2 or link it with another project. I'm not sure I understand this... the fact that the build system uses python means that it is really painful to configure the build system to emit a static library? (This should absolutely not be the case! Meson has a core option `-Ddefault_library={static|shared|both}` to select what kind of library you want to build, for any library whose build description claims it can support either one. It's a bit like cmake's `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS` except much more powerful.). However, as far as I can tell, su2 doesn't mark any of its libraries as public at all (i.e., installable) so maybe that's a moot point. As far as making python be necessary to build the project, I think this mainly boils down to ""I myself use cmake, I have cmake installed, I don't want to install another program when I could use the program I already have"". Is it really that big of a deal, though? The software *does* use it, and it's not that difficult to install TBH (Linux operating systems in particular almost certainly have it installed already).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1711#issuecomment-1312985406:972,down,down,972,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1711#issuecomment-1312985406,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"> There are 2 cases in the testcases repository, both are using the Euler solver. Maybe also check if your case is running correctly with the settings from those testcases. Earlier, I was defining the mesh movement for the static zone as:. ` GRID_MOVEMENT= NONE `. since it was stationary. However, after checking the test cases, I found that the stator zones should also be defined as moving as. ```; GRID_MOVEMENT= RIGID_MOTION; MOTION_ORIGIN= 0.0 0.0 0.0; ROTATION_RATE = 0.0 0.0 0.0 ; ```. even though the mesh stays stationary. In that case, the unphysical flow results I presented earlier vanished. Earlier, I tried the cylinder test case with the inner zone having . ```; GRID_MOVEMENT= RIGID_MOTION; MOTION_ORIGIN= 0.0 0.0 0.0; ROTATION_RATE = 0.0 0.0 0.0; ```. and the outer zone having; ` GRID_MOVEMENT= NONE `. where the simulation gave physically viable results. I guess the zone interface may not accurately work if the `GRID_MOVEMENT` options of the neighbouring zones do not match while one of the zones has a non-zero movement. However, I have not simulated any other test cases. Also, the sliding_interface/rotating_cylinders test case diverges with the given .cfg files.

One quick remark: I am aware that it is indeed possible to deform the mesh within `SU2_CFD`, I use this extensively for static aero-elastic analysis. However, I have not been able to have the deformed mesh be written to file at output (in SU2 or CGNS format). This is fine for aero-elastic updates (movement of the surface due to _structural displacements_), where it is sufficient to see the deformed mesh in the post-processing files. It becomes impractical though, for design updates (movement of the surface to due to _design displacements_, i.e. representing changes in the design variables) where the new mesh is a useful intermediate result. Even if this is just an issue in my configuration file, I think that a stand-alone driver or equivalent of `SU2_DEF` would remain useful. For each new set of updated design variables during shape optimisation, a single mesh deformation is sufficient to provide the new, updated jig geometry which all of the aerodynamic or aero-elastic analyses (one for each oper",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1262#issuecomment-818839696:396,avail,available,396,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1262#issuecomment-818839696,2,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"@EduardoMolina : Nice results! Thanks for the comments. You are seeing more warnings bc I did in fact change the tolerance that controls the warning. But, note that this tolerance only controls when to print the warnings, so the matches should have still be the same (nearest neighbor after transformation). . The reason is that the new implementation assumes a 1-to-1 matching of the nodes and surface elements on either side of the periodic face. To be consistent, the points/faces on either side should match exactly so that they can be summed into a complete dual control volume (this assumption is made in the implementation and the partial residuals are summed as such). Nice catch on the fem_solver check. I will add that to the conditional. Thanks for the review @rsanfer. I will submit the final version shortly and if the tests pass, I would propose we merge this one first, if alright with @pcarruscag (the reason being that I would likely need your help to update the implementation for templating in the end anyway :) ).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/652#issuecomment-485930910:113,toler,tolerance,113,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/652#issuecomment-485930910,2,['toler'],['tolerance']

Availability,"@WallyMaier thank you. Interesting... 1. This reference reminded me to add the contribution of the turbulence kinetic energy (+2/3 v rho k) in the energy equation source (see page 10 equation 2.30, pdf page 37), so that's done. 2. This reference will be helpful If I get to do the axysimmetry source terms for k and omega (by comparing equations 2.31 and 2.31 to equations B.2 and B.3) but that will be in a separate PR. In fact I am getting good results for RANS already (although no time for a thorough validation). 3. In that reference they have also done what I did before and pulled out the primitive derivatives and neglected the viscosity gradient and then came up with the same axisymmetry momentum source terms so that is comforting. However, their energy source terms are different and that made me think. What we have now is according to the first reference, so it should be fine unless there is an error in it. I find it suspicious that both aux derivatives are wrt y and none wrt x given the that we have one wrt x and one wrt y in the momentum equation...

Availability,"@auzbaig : sorry that this has been giving you issues. I think there are a couple of things happening here. First, there were important changes when all of the output was rewritten for v7, including a change in how the output fields are recognized by the python framework. In this commit (https://github.com/su2code/SU2/commit/39dbebc574a0886fa7c165d342dce8490947dbbe), a new history mapping capability was added, so that, rather than hard-coding the possible types of output/objective fields, the list can be updated automatically using updateHistoryMap.py, which parses the C++ files for available fields. You can see the available output fields for your problem by executing the dry run mode. The second thing is that updateHistoryMap.py only parses a set list of files (you can find the list at the top of the file), and at the moment, the turbomachinery-specific outputs are not included. The turbomachinery features are being restructured currently in #866, which includes connecting it to the new output classes. @talbring @salvovitale : please correct me if I am missing anything",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/889#issuecomment-602328589:590,avail,available,590,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/889#issuecomment-602328589,2,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"@pcarruscag, I agree with you it will be hard to beat the MKL (running at 60 percent peak for most of the gemm calls for the DG-solver), but if you don't have any performance loss, that would already be nice, as it improves readability. Furthermore, the performance of the DG solver in combination with the discrete adjoint is horrible, because it relies on my very naive implementation of the matrix products. So it would already be something if we can get an improvement there, although we do not use the DG adjoint solver (yet). . For me the easiest way to test things out for the DG-solver would actually be in SU2 itself. @economon put some nice profiling routines in there for the gemm calls, which can be used without any additional work to test eigen. @pcarruscag (or somebody else), could you create a branch in which eigen is downloaded in the external directory? I think I can manage from there. Thanks,.

Availability,"@pcarruscag: the approach to use different gradient methods for the convective and viscous terms is relatively common across codes. If it is a computational cost concern, this can be addressed by fusing the kernels. . However, the bigger issue at hand is the other comment that is made in the article about the choice between LSQ and WLSQ/GG for 2nd-order upwind reconstructions: while less accurate, the former is much more robust, while the latter two usually require limiters just to obtain a stable solution on stretched RANS-type meshes, even for flows where we do not expect shocks/discontinuities. The problem with always requiring a limiter is that they stall convergence due to chatter, which apart from the obvious problems, also causes issues for the adjoint. I think everyone has experienced this. Hence the compromise to use both gradients as I note above, which is also stated on p. 9 of Anderson and Bonhaus ""An Implicit Upwind Algorithm for Computing Turbulent Flows on Unstructured Grids."" In that paper they mention an additional interesting point that, in their numerical tests, LSQ outperforms WLSQ/GG for reconstructing nonlinear data at interfaces on highly-stretched meshes. Note the WLSQ/GG gradients are used for the viscous terms, which is important for accuracy. This type of approach is still applied in FUN3D. . If there are any accuracy concerns, we can also address those via our typical verification tools. I agree that we should continue along the path of looking at grid quality issues and how they impact the numerics (potentially adding some grid-based corrections / limiting), but I think the proposed approach in this PR will serve us well.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790#issuecomment-532883592:425,robust,robust,425,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790#issuecomment-532883592,1,['robust'],['robust']

Availability,"@talbring Thanks for the quick and helpful answer! I'm looking at creating an ebuild/package for gentoo, compilation is a lot simpler than OpenFoam :P which is a big plus :). Anyway, I was looking at the old docs (the main docs still point to 6.0, I missed the red text that mentioned that somehow :P), not sure why, but you're right it's indeed mentioned in the 7.0 docs here https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Build-SU2-Linux-MacOS/#configuration-and-compilation. The ""Automatically installed dependencies"" section left me a bit confused because it sounded like the things listed there, which includes meson and ninja, would always get installed.; Maybe merging that section into the configuration and compilation section might help to make it more clear?. If you don't mind I have some additional questions:; - I didn't initialize the git submodule at all and configuration, compilation and running worked fine. Does this mean the CoDiPack and MeDiPack dependencies are optional? Or does this mean I could have a crash at runtime somewhere?; - Would it be possible to add a source package to the GitHub releases (in addition to the binary ones) that includes the (CoDiPack and MeDiPack) submodules? Unfortunately the GitHub provided source downloads don't include submodules.; - Are MKL and OpenBLAS build-time and exclusive options or can they both be compiled in and chosen at runtime?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/911#issuecomment-598751341:1242,down,downloads,1242,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/911#issuecomment-598751341,2,['down'],['downloads']
Availability,"@talbring Thanks. That second link is very informative. I think that SU2 could really use a more advanced build process, and meson seems like a good candidate. As an example of why I think SU2 needs a better build process: Right now for AD builds, the build process listed in the tutorial asks you to use the `preconfigure.py` script to download and update the codi and medi git submodules. But there's a couple problems with the preconfigure script. It doesn't support out-of-source builds, and it expects all configure arguments to come in ""option=value"" pairs. A good build process (using CMake or meson) should allow adding submodules or external packages easily, without problems like these.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/685#issuecomment-500395507:337,down,download,337,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/685#issuecomment-500395507,1,['down'],['download']
Availability,"@talbring That was a good point about placement. I was able to move this implementation to a function called `FixedCL_Convergence()` in the euler solver class. It also allowed me to make it a little more robust. Since it still requires information about the convergence that is calculated in the integration container, the method has to be called `CFluidIteration::Iterate()`. I included the details of the implementation in the Constant CL tutorial on the website. That is in a pull request for the website. Consequently, that [pull request ](https://github.com/su2code/su2code.github.io/pull/16) needs to be approved first so that the regression test for this one can pass.

Availability,"@timjim333 it could be an issue with shared libraries, which ultimately is a path issue, as you suspected.; To verify it try opening a python shell, checking the version displayed (should be your 3.7.8) and try `import pyamg` in the shell. If the ""No such file or directory"" error shows up, it means pyamg was not correctly installed; otherwise it is in fact installed. In the latter case, you can check if your python is configured to enable shared libraries. To do it, according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23201498/how-to-check-if-python3-was-built-with-enable-shared), in the python shell you can type ; `import sysconfig`; `sysconfig.get_config_vars('Py_ENABLE_SHARED')`; If the result is `[0]`, ie ""False"", you have to build python with the option `--enable-shared`. ; Now, I don't know how to do accomplish that with conda, but with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) it involves installing the desired python version with `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install <version>`. To recap, a ""workflow for newbies"" which appears to be working for me is. 1. install pyenv either from [source](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) or from your distibution repositories, if available. IMPORTANT: make sure the environment variables are correctly set and `pyenv init` is added to your shell, as per the installation instructions.; 2. install the desired python version (for example 3.7.8), enabling shared libraries: ; `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install 3.7.8`; 3. clone/download the [feature_adap](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/feature_adap) branch of SU2;; 4. in the SU2 folder, configure meson ; `./meson.py build` ; and make sure to update the environment variables in your `.bashrc` as indicated by meson's output.; 5. use ninja to build and install SU2 ; `./ninja -C build install`;; if you run into a permission error, specify an installation directory passing the `--prefix` option to meson, as explained [here](https://www.cfd-online.com/Fo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/948#issuecomment-751823130:275,error,error,275,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/948#issuecomment-751823130,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,A way to parameterize an airfoil shape is with the use of Kulfan parameters as part of the CST method (http://brendakulfan.com/docs/CST3.pdf).

Availability,"Agreed that it is a bit different... . I would add one practical comment for consideration: it is worth checking whether the main restriction we have is related to approximations in the Jacobian that limit the effective CFL we can use or whether the convergence of the linear solver itself is a problem (speed or complete lack of convergence). A quick test without resorting to another library is to increase the fill-in for ILU-preconditioned GMRES, which is very expensive/slow but should converge difficult problems, and to check how high we can take the CFL when allowing each nonlinear iteration to converge to a tight tolerance in the linear solver, say 1e-14 (you can output the linear solver residuals to verify convergence). If we can take the CFL higher with a more performant linear solver, then it could be worth the effort to try other options. If the CFL must remain low for stability, then perhaps we should look at the quality of the Jacobians we construct to see if we can improve, or even try exact Jacobians with AD if we can afford it. A more advanced CFL ramping strategy could also be helpful here to get us closer to a solution before trying to aggressively converge. Just some options to try - it is an important topic and it would be good to isolate the primary restriction.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/643#issuecomment-460811699:624,toler,tolerance,624,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/643#issuecomment-460811699,1,['toler'],['tolerance']

I'll get the chance to jump into this topic which I'm interested in.; As some of you know I'm currently working on sliding meshes and multi-zone problems for turbo-machinery applications.; Currently also the cinterpolator class, in particular for the nearest neighbour interpolation, relies on brute force search algorithms. ; Moreover, a lot of possible (future) interpolation methods may rely on a nearest neighbour search in the very first place (I'm thinking for instance to the construction of a polynomial interpolation pattern which would require to find a bunch of donor points on the donor mesh); This may lead to a dramatic increase of the computational time when dealing with very large problems like for instance unsteady multi-stage turbo-machinery problems, since, for these particular applications, at every time step we will need to reconstruct the communication pattern among rotors and stators.; So the implementation of a clever way to carry out the nearest neighbour search will be mandatory in the future of SU2. I think that it would be very useful to have a reliable and reusable tree search library so that everyone can exploit the same function calls.; For former works I did use the ANN library from the University of Maryland which is distributed under the GNU lesser public license, moreover I talked with Edwin and he also has some routines he wrote himself that could suits this particular problem.

Furthermore, the performance of the DG solver in combination with the discrete adjoint is horrible, because it relies on my very naive implementation of the matrix products. So it would already be something if we can get an improvement there, although we do not use the DG adjoint solver (yet). For me the easiest way to test things out for the DG-solver would actually be in SU2 itself. @economon<https://github.com/economon> put some nice profiling routines in there for the gemm calls, which can be used without any additional work to test eigen. @pcarruscag<https://github.com/pcarruscag> (or somebody else), could you create a branch in which eigen is downloaded in the external directory?

Availability,"Alright. There's a thorny part of this merge that needs to be resolved. I would like the decisions reviewed before I proceed to make any more changes. The differences between revision d1e3a18 and revision e6e6e6b are very small, aside from an extra test file. But revision d1e3a18 fails the regression tests and revision e6e6e6b passes the regression tests. Specifically, it's only the CHT incompressible case that's failing. The test results show:. test_vals (stored): 0.000000, 0.000000, -7.685301, -12947.783696; sim_vals (computed): 0.000000, 0.000000, -7.685301, -12947.783678 ; delta_vals: 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000018. It's only the total heat flux that's different, and it's only off by 1E-7%. I believe that these changes are due to floating-point errors. To check and make sure nothing is going crazy, I ran the test case under both the develop and the PR branches. When I compared the solution files, I couldn't find any points where the solution differed by more than 0.0003%. The differences seem to be very small. The two differences between revision d1e3a18 and revision e6e6e6b can be summarized as follows:. 1. In the `CNumerics::GetViscousIncProjJacs()` calculation on the develop branch, a quantity called `theta` is calculated. `theta` is the magnitude of the `val_normal` parameter, squared. The catch is that `val_normal` is passed as a unit vector (named `UnitNormal` in `CAvgGradInc_Flow::ComputeResidual`). So `theta` should always be equal to one, with some floating point errors. In the failing revision, the value is set explicitly to one. In the passing revision, the magnitude is calculated explicitly. I checked, and the difference between `theta` and 1.0 is always of the order 1E-16 or less.; 2. The second change affects where the area is multiplied into the Jacobian. When the area is multiplied at a later stage, very small differences in the calculated quantities appear. I don't like revision e6e6e6b, and I would like to revert it.

Availability,"As described in Issue #431, using `SU2_MSH` for periodic mesh construction can be buggy due to its sorting of nodes. Under certain conditions, nodes can be duplicated and/or missing from the output *.su2 file. This pull request implements a more robust sorting process, where the sorting occurs in the following steps:. 1. Send/receive nodes are explicitly identified; 2. The sorted list is created without any send/receive nodes.; 3. The receive and then send nodes are added to the sorted list. Here's a few comments about the pull request:; + Since this routine is only run once, I felt the usability of std::vector outweighed the computational efficiency of raw arrays.; + I had to create two lists, NewSort and ReverseSort, instead of the original one list (NewSort). That's because two different mappings between node numbers need to occur. In the old code, where the list was sorted by switching elements, the two mappings _should_ have been identical. Since the improved method does not use switching, two lists are necessary.; + There's a lot of memory leaks/uninitialized values when checking this pull request with Valgrind. I checked them, and this pull request doesn't create any _new_ memory issues. Apparently both `SU2_CFD` and `SU2_MSH` have memory issues. #### Verification; Since none of the existing regression tests run `SU2_MSH`, I created a separate case to verify both the bug and the fix. It's a simple 3x3 cube that's periodic in the z-direction. I've attached the files below. Here's the steps:. 1. Run `SU2_MSH MSH.cfg`; 2. Run `SU2_CFD per_CFD_dev.cfg`. Using the existing develop branch, the verification case runs into a segfault when writing the output. This pull request allows the verification case to complete successfully. You can also check the original test case from Issue #431 to verify the bug fix. If any of you know of additional verification tests I could run, then please let me know.

Availability,"As we mentioned in the dev meeting where you exposed the problem, the implementation is not good for strongly coupled flows, and I would guess that it is worse for diffusion than convection (because diffusion is elliptic).; I suspect the main problem is that the linear system does not contain information from the other side of the interface, meaning the solution of the two domains is effectively decoupled.; You could try running the case at much lower CFL (below 1) even with an explicit method.; It is also possible that the current treatment could be improved, since it is an example of multiplicative Schwartz decomposition, maybe there is an ""optimal"" way of implementing that from a physics point of view. Just speculating here, but maybe it would help treating the interface as an outlet if flow is going out, and as an inlet if flow is coming in.; On the numerics side, you can also try hacking the MZ driver to use something more stable than block-Gauss-Seidel (e.g. some quasi-Newton thing for the interface).

Availability,"Charanya,. thanks for the detailed answer. Let me ask you some more info. Apparently, you where able to reproduce the results I had comparing the two code versions simply using different boundary conditions on the latest code version. Can you specify me how?. Tobi,. In the meanwhile, to narrow down the problem, I ran also a couple tests in 2D to seek confirmation. For the (Euler) **pitching_NACA64A010.cfg** test case in the repository I rerun the same test at AoA of 1 deg and removing the pitching (no mesh deforming). I attach config files and summaries relative to the test cases. [config_CFD_6_2_0.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/3938858/config_CFD_6_2_0.txt); [Summary_6_2_0.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/3938859/Summary_6_2_0.txt); [config_CFD_6_0_1.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/3938863/config_CFD_6_0_1.txt); [Summary_6_0_1.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/3938865/Summary_6_0_1.txt).

Availability,"Dear @vdweide,. I do see your point as well, in fact I remember that I raised my concerns about this when the multi-physics driver started to be used for multi-zone, single physics problems. Unfortunately, moving down the loop in the zones would break the FSI solver, and also the FSI coupled adjoint solver that we have put together, so I have to advise otherwise. . When we first put together the Driver structure, the objective was to be able to fully converge different physical problems independently from each other. Then, the level of abstraction of the classes we implemented permitted for the structure to be used in fluid-fluid problems. CFD is not my top expertise, so the details escape to me, but it always seemed to me more natural to have an upper loop on the physics (the driver loop), and then have an internal loop over fluid zones. . That is pretty much the same idea as @salvovitale is proposing: keeping the Driver as is, for different physics, and incorporate inside the Iteration the loop over different zones in the fluid domain. This structure would address problems like Salvatore's example of multi-stage turbomachinery. Let's see what others think of this, happy to have a chat or a telecom over this. Kind regards,.

Availability,"Dear Daumantas,. I appreciate your effort in adding support for cmake in SU2. We have recently introduced the Meson build system (https://mesonbuild.com/) (#685, #745) as a candidate to replace automake. A guide on how to use can be found [here](https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Build-SU2-From-Source/). The idea is that we will have this system along automake at least for the upcoming version 7 and that we get rid of automake afterwards. Considering that, I don't think that it makes sense to maintain 3 different build systems **at the moment**. I really hate turning contributions down, but this one is three months too late. However, we might reconsider adding support for another build system once we got rid of automake, or, if we feel that meson does not fit our needs. I am all ears to hear other opinions.

Availability,"Dear SU2 users,. I continued the investigation and managed to track down the source of the problem.; The issues I face with SU2 appear when my wing geometry has several airfoils across the span. I ran several cases with supercritical airfoils and NACA 4 digits airfoils. As soon as the airfoil was changing along the span, SU2 had troubles computing the projected and wetted area of the wing, an attaining a correct solution. To better illustrate the issue, I attached a SU2 .cfg file (dummy.txt) and Gmsh .geo file (dummy_mesh.txt) to this post.; The geometry is the same as in the previous post except that I used 3 different airfoils along the span. That is, I replaced the NASA SC(2)-0712 by the {NASA SC(2)-0714, NASA SC(2)-0712, NASA SC(3)-0712}.; These airfoils are similar, so I expected to recover similar results. However, I observed that:; - SU2 computed the wrong z-projected area : 23.1 m^2 instead of 38 m^2,; - the y+ of the first cell is way too high in certain regions (see attached image, grey zones are the area where y+<1),; - the Cp distribution if not looking good (makes sense with those values of y+), see attached file.

Availability,"Dear friends of the Heat Solver and Periodic Boundary conditions, . I feared no exhausting work and added periodic BC to the Heat Solver. Stock up your supplies, cancel meetings for today and dive into the diff to review this piece. Ok for real, I don't know if that is all that has to be done? I did some early testing with mixed results, I noticed that I had to turn down CFL for the solid zone (1e4 in non-periodic case-> 1) to get a solution that seems to respect the periodicity. If the CFL is too large then I get some spurious temperature and weird residual pattern. Any comments are appreciated. This was just a first shot so Im gonna do more digging on that issue. ## Related Work; Periodic bc was initially implemented in #652 . ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"Description:. There is a problem in the `pysu2_nastran.py` script when reading the SET1 section from Nastran .f06 output files. The current implementation of the function that reads the SET1 section is insufficient for more complex, such as 3D, mesh structures. In the tutorial, a simple airfoil case is used with a mesh consisting of 123 surface nodes, which works fine. However, for more complex mesh structures, the SET1 section in the Nastran .f06 file includes additional lines with dates, headers, and the Nastran program's name. These extra lines cause issues while reading the SET1 section, leading to errors in processing the file. https://github.com/su2code/Tutorials/blob/master/multiphysics/unsteady_fsi_python/Ma01/modal.f06. line 376 starts with SET1. There is no additional line between the SET1 ID's. But for more complex mesh, additional lines look like this:.

Availability,"FULLMG_CYCLE produces segmentation faults in different ways:. 1. When using the SST turbulent solver; 2. When running in parallel (mpirun/mpiexec). This PR tries to fix these segmentation faults. ## Proposed Changes; **First issue**; In CTurbSSTSolver::CTurbSSTSolver() we do not initialize the residual nor the solution if we are using a FULLMG_CYCLE, producing a segmentation fault. I have included a line of code to consider the FULLMG_CYCLE scenario. **Second issue**; This issue is not related to mpi _per se_ but to domain partitioning.; In CMultiGridGeometry::CMultiGridGeometry() is computed the ratio between the number of points in the finest grid and a given coarse grid level. If this ratio is below 2.5 (I do not know why do we make this evaluation neither the reason why exactly 2.5) a multigrid level is removed (without warning the user!?), see lines 629-632. For a few cases that I have tested, when running in parallel certain grid levels have a ratio below 2.5 hence are removed. This does not happen when running in serial.; In CMultiGridIntegration::MultiGrid_Iteration() the index of the ""finest grid"" is then required and the system of equations at the ""finest grid"" level is intended to be solved. This index is set by default with the number multigrid levels specified by the user on the config file. In case that multigrid levels have been removed, when trying to access to the ""finest level"" mesh in CMultiGridIntegration::MultiGrid_Iteration() that level does not exist and produces a segmentation fault. To solve this issue:; - Stop removing multigrid levels in CMultiGridGeometry::CMultiGridGeometry() or improve the function. Why do we need to check whether the ratio is below a certain level? We should just check if the coarse level is empty, i.e., no control volumes.; - When removing a MG level in CMultiGridGeometry::CMultiGridGeometry() subtract one to the index of the finest grid, i.e., config->SubtractFinestMesh();.

Availability,"First of all, thanks @bmunguia for picking this up.. I ran out of time when we were wrapping up v7, so the approach to check for stalling residuals within the CFL adaption routine was half-baked at best. It can definitely be improved (I'm not happy that I left some magic numbers hard-coded in there!). The implementation that is there to check for stall was very loosely based on the type of check we use for computing the Cauchy criteria (accumulated residual changes over time), but we should consider different approaches altogether. Btw, the original CFL adaption routine used something close to Switched Evolution Relaxation, while the new strategy is Exponential Progression with Under-relaxation (see ""A Robust Adaptive Solution Strategy for High-Order Implicit CFD Solvers,"" AIAA 2011-3696 for a short description of both). As you also guessed, I had wanted to experiment with separate CFL numbers for flow and turbulence but also did not get to it. In the end, as @pcarruscag says, this is a very empirical task. It will be difficult to nail down a perfect configuration for all problems, but we might be able to come up with some best practices for choosing tunable parameters if folks have the time to run a lot of numerical experiments for a range of cases to see what works best.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1036#issuecomment-653182720:712,Robust,Robust,712,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1036#issuecomment-653182720,2,"['Robust', 'down']","['Robust', 'down']"
Availability,"First off, I love the changes. A cleanup of COuput and greater output flexibility were much needed. So let me see if I understand this code. Say that I, as a developer, want to add a new variable to the volume output. For example, I want the production of turbulent kinetic energy from the SST model during a compressible simulation. As a user, I can always add new outputs by adding new field names to the config file. But production isn't one of the (currently) available config-file options. So I would have to code it. First, I would obviously make sure that the production is properly stored in the turbulence variable class, with an accessor like `GetTurbProduction()`. Second, in `CFlowCompOutput::LoadVolumeData`, I would add to the appropriate place:. ```cpp; SetVolumeOutputValue(""PRODUCTION"", iPoint, Node_Turb->GetTurbProduction());; ```. Third, I would add `PRODUCTION` as a cfg input by adding the following line to `CFlowCompOutput::SetVolumeOutputFields`:. ```cpp; AddVolumeOutput(""PRODUCTION"", ""Turb_Production"", ""PRIMITVE""); ```. I could also split off production into its own output group by changing `PRIMITVE` to any other name. This name does not have to be registered anywhere else. In other words, I can change `PRIMITVE` to `SST_NUMERICS` and the only other place I need to put `SST_NUMERICS` is my cfg file. Finally, I could add either of the two following lines to my cfg file:; ```; VOLUME_OUTPUT= (COORDINATES, SOLUTION, PRODUCTION) ; VOLUME_OUTPUT= (COORDINATES, SOLUTION, SST_NUMERICS); ``` . Is this example correct? If not, what am I misunderstanding?

Availability,"Folks,. This is indeed a very important capability for many different applications: from interpolation of solutions from coarser grids to finer grids, to querying an unsteady solution, to implementing numerical error estimates…and many others. It is important that the search / interpolation routines work when interpolating between grids where some points in the target grid may fall outside of the source grid and, therefore some notion of distance to the wall is needed. Fortunately, Edwin van der Weide had worked on an interpolation library that @sravya91 (who received her PhD yesterday at our graduation ceremony and is now working at NVIDIA) used in her work. Jayant Mukhopadhaya and Brian Munguia have also been testing/improving the library. Perhaps everyone can comment on current status and we can create a small task force to see what still needs to be done and who can do what?. Best,. Juan.

Availability,"Following this discussion, I want to share certain points related to convergence -. 1- Some good/fast solution initialisation methods will be helpful to start with (commercial solver like Fluent uses Full Multigrid initialisation /FMG - euler initialisation, which provides fast initial guess to start with). 2- Switching from first order to second order gradually will be helpful. 3- Smart/tuned CFL ramping strategy (some commercial codes have tuned way of doing it where CFL range varies from subsonic to hypersonic Mach number). 4- As Dr. Economon mentioned exact Jacobians play important role (In SU2 code, HLLC, JST and Roe have exact/nearly exact Jacobians). I observed that with inconsistent discretization (with some of the problems), solution does not go with higher CFL even in later stages and takes more iterations to converge. 5- It will be desirable to arrive at fewer set/combination of Linear solver+preconditioner which covers broad range of problems. That will help in faster evolution of solution convergence strategies . 6- Handling poor quality cells in some way may be important from practical usage point of view with realistic geometries (I don’t know how much literature is available for such stuff).

Availability,"Great progress, thanks @clarkpede !. As for your notes, some thoughts:; - I think you are already doing this but just in case... manually specifying the info at each node can be made a little easier by automatically generating the files for the first time if they don't exist at runtime. We had code that would do this for the grid motion case, and perhaps you can reuse it to generate inlet profile files with the correct global ID and dummy free-stream state to save the trouble of finding the global IDs by hand (that is what we wanted to avoid as well). Then you can at least use excel or another text editor to swap out the data.; - I wouldn't worry about interpolation to start. This can be added later.; - MG is a little tough, but I think we should be able to do a mapping down to the coarse levels in a similar way that we do the restarts in the volume mesh.

Availability,"Harichand, Giulio, Edwin, and all,. I would definitely prefer to use either (a) an open source library that is actively maintained, or (b) our own tree-based search. I do think that this is important for the various reasons that have been outlined/discussed already. The method Harichand describes is pretty much what we did in the ASC program. Edwin can provide more details (and we had an AIAA paper around 2005 on this topic). My suggestion: if Edwin has a tree search in C++ already and someone is willing to spend the time to integrated it, that would be the best option. We get the performance that is needed with a lightweight tree search, without external dependencies (to libraries that may provide a lot of other functionality we do not need), and we can expand to parallel trees as needed. If there is no code already available, then PCL seems like a good alternative (since it seems one can compile only portions of the library). Any takers?. Cheers,. Juan. On Jun 8, 2016, at 4:35 AM, Harichand M V <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>> wrote:. All,. Thanks for your comments. I think ANNlibrary is no longer maintained. It would be better if we can use a well maintained library in-order to prevent issues in future. Additionally ANNlibrary does not support distributed trees. As far as I know, pointcloud library also does not support distributed trees. I guess we will have to write a wrapper routine using MPI. This will create a local tree for its own portion of the surface mesh. Now distance computation can be done by querying all the trees and using the minimum. One catch here is that we will have to compute distance queries in a group in order to prevent the communication latency eating up the advantage.

Availability,"Have a look at a9466bb158ca8675352bf3b4b887cbf82b7f28ff for a suggestion on how to disable OpDiLib within the scope of the existing build options (casually tested). To clarify the AD implications: If you use OpDiLib, you will have atomic adjoints where no shared reading optimizations are applied, even with `-t 1`. Disabling OpDiLib - if we add that option - will amend this. The presence of `_OPENMP`, however, makes SU2 use the thread-safe CoDiPack type and enables thread-safety augmentations in CoDiPack.

Availability,"Have you tried the Newton-Krylov approach in SU2? Boostconv sounds like Newton-Krylov. Our limitation with NK at the moment is that we don't have a good linear preconditioner to converge the Krylov solver to reasonable tolerances at high CFL (which is required to make this type of approach effective and efficient). In the papers, the types of problems to which they apply these methods are very different from the application you have in mind.

Availability,"Hello Economon, here are some of my suggestions for the future convention of comments of the option structure:. 1. __Index__. To illustrate the relationship among so many options, we need to set some reliance relationship manually in the comment lines. Do you think using names of options as index is reliable? I think it will be helpful for code writers, but might not for code readers.; 2. __Relationship__. Here are some kinds of relationship between options. They are needed in comment for auto parsing.; - _Reliance_. Some options may rely on the precedent ones, otherwise they will not be triggered to be used. Furthermore, descendent options may be optional or compulsory. For the optional ones, users don’t have to set the values they need, while for the compulsory ones, users will automatically see the tips of what kinds of options are needed.; - _Mutual Exclusive_. Some options can not coexist together, or their precedent can not coexist together. Maybe option a has precedent A, option b has precedent B. If A and B can not coexist, a and b can’t , too. I wish that there is already such C++ package for our need, even when it just covers the functionality of structuring the relationship net.

Availability,"Hello SU2 community,. I'm currently interested in the theoretical background used in SU2_DOT (both in the FD or AD option). Is it available somewhere? The use I'm interested in is the propagation of the sensitivity of the selected objective function with respect to the boundary grid displacements to the FFD control point displacements. Moreover I have two specific questions:. 1) If, for design optimisation, design variables are the FFD control points, once performed the point inversion (which is usually done only at the beginning of the optimization process), the relation between surface grid nodes and FFD control points is fixed and analytically given by the Bernstein polynomials, once provided the parametric coordinates. Why, then, the need to perform the chain rule with Finite Differences or AD?. 2) SU2_DOT uses, to perform the chain rule, surface adjoint solution(in case of FD) or the volume adjoint solution (in case of AD). These values are provided in output by the SU2_CFD adjoint solver. If printing the solution in CSV format I can read, among others, values such `""Sensitivity_x"",""Sensitivity_y"",""Sensitivity_z"",""Surface_Sensitivity""` on every grid point. Now, these values, trying to give a look inside the code, are addressed as, respectively, sensitivities in x/y/z/normal directions. Are these values the sensitivity of the selected objective function with respect to the grid node displacement?. 3) In file `python_wrapper_structure.cpp` function; `vector<passivedouble> CDriver::GetMeshDisp_Sensitivity(unsigned short iMarker, unsigned long iVertex)` ; also provides boundary displacement sensitivities of the objective function, with the call:; `Disp_Sens[0] = solver->GetNodes()->GetBoundDisp_Sens(iPoint, 0);`. These values are, in effect the sensitivity of the objective function with respect to the grid node displacements as some Finite Difference tests confirmed.

Availability,"Hello all,. I have a question about using the MARKER_INTERNAL. I was expecting that adding a MARKER_INTERNAL will not affect the solution in any way. Though, when I try to use it I observe a spurious spike in the solution at the location of the internal marker. . To create an interior marker in Pointwise, I create a baffle zone which connects two blocks (https://www.pointwise.com/doc/user-manual/cae/set-boundary-conditions/boundary-condition-connections.html). So there are two sides of the face and I marked them both as internal markers. This increases the number of elements in mesh because the nodes on the marker are duplicated (one for each side except on the perimeter). So essentially, at the each (x,y,z) location of the internal marker, there are two nodes. Instead of having 6 neighbors as an internal node (hex elements in 3-D), the two nodes ""share"" the neighbors which leads to error in momentum and mass balance in both the nodes causing errors in the solution. I am not quite sure how to fix this. Is there a different way to use internal markers? Or is the internal marker not supported anymore?.

I have attached a pptx to this comment that explains a little more about how the procedures work, the ""allow edits by maintainers"" box is checked. If you have any questions for me I will still be available to answer them, but I am not able to actively work on this anymore. The test cases should be available for @bigfooted, is it possible for you to place them where they are required?. As for the depth that was mentioned in an earlier comment of @TobiKattmann : the depth is an option that can be used as a stopping criterion. For every iteration without problems the recursion depth is increased. This way, it can be used as a measure for how close to the limit you are going to stop, as opposed to stopping after the maximum amount of iterations.

Availability,"Hello everybody:; I would like to have more informations about the correct usage of discrete Adjoint when the fluid domain contains two different zones.; I tried to run a discrete Adjoint simulation using the test case ""Axial_stage_2D"" (inside the turbomachinery sub-directory); the cfg file has been modified in order to allow the adjoint calculation, Hick-Henne bumps have been set on both surfaces of the blades but when I tried to run the simulation there have been several problems:; - firstly, SU2_DEF in stand-alone mode seems to disregard the second part of the mesh (the rotor);; - when I tried to apply a deformation just on the statoric part, the DEF module placed Hicks-Henne bumps on the surface but in positions which were incoherent with the ones specified into the configuration file.; - I used the Python script but even in that case, the effective bump position was different from the expected one.; - Using the Python script discrete_adjoint.py with nzones =2 (specified through the -z 2 flag), two different history-files (history_direct_0.dat, history_direct_1.dat) are sistematically generated by the CFD module (one for each zone) but when the next module (CFD_AD) is called, it tries to find a single history file named ""history_direct.dat"", which does not exist, and consequently displays an error and stops.

Availability,"Hello,. So, to clarify, there were two issues:. 1) With the old commit (382e82f), we were seeing the assertion failure at line 1881 of numerics_structure.cpp, but only with the very large mesh (180 million cells). 2) With the newer commit (c093a62), we were seeing the assertion failure at line 294 of C2DContainer.hpp, which was occurring even with smaller meshes (7 million cells). The solution to (2) appears to be to change `geometry->node[iPoint]->GetnNeighbor()` to `geometry->node[iPoint]->GetnPoint()` at line 3759 of CEulerSolver.cpp, in the `CEulerSolver::SetUpwind_Ducros_Sensor()` method. I made this change locally, and attempted to run on our large mesh. Issue (2) seems to be fixed, but we still run into issue (1). I have now gone through the read restart routines, and have found a potential issue:. For reference, the restart file for our large mesh with averaging data included consists of:; 39 fields * 75,107,967 points = 2,929,210,713 variable values (which is larger than `INT_MAX`). Beginning at line 3931 of CSolver.cpp, in method `CSolver::Read_SU2_Restart_Binary(...)`, we have the following:. ```; int *blocklen = new int[geometry->GetnPointDomain()];; int *displace = new int[geometry->GetnPointDomain()];; int counter = 0;; for (iPoint_Global = 0; iPoint_Global < geometry->GetGlobal_nPointDomain(); iPoint_Global++ ) {; if (geometry->GetGlobal_to_Local_Point(iPoint_Global) > -1) {; blocklen[counter] = nFields;; displace[counter] = iPoint_Global*nFields;; counter++;; }; }; MPI_Type_indexed(geometry->GetnPointDomain(), blocklen, displace, MPI_DOUBLE, &filetype);; ```; The problem here is that for our case, where `iPoint_Global` can get up to 75,107,967 and `nFields` = 39, the value assigned to `displace[counter]` in the loop can over-run `INT_MAX`. This would result in potential garbage / incorrect displace values being passed to `MPI_Type_indexed(...)`. Unfortunately, simply changing `displace` to a `long int *` won't work, as the expected argument type for `",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/949#issuecomment-622026420:111,failure,failure,111,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/949#issuecomment-622026420,4,['failure'],['failure']

I tried to compare the same case but steady (I attach the summary). Results in this case are fairly similar and (in my opinion) raise no warnings. That is good to hear. ; Luckily @cvencro (Thanks for that 👍 ) ran some tests and found that #740 (which rewrites Euler Wall boundaries for compressible and incompressible flows ... which was me btw) introduces the changes you see. The Euler wall for compressible is changed a bit in the way the boundary condition is enforced. Upon convergence both version should recover (close to) the same value. If the results in a steady state are the same/very-similar and if an unsteady simulation at low enough Reynolds-number converges to the same steady result (or oscillate in the same bounds) -> I would say it is simply some purely numerical effect based on the unphysical initialization and different treatment of the euler wall boundary. . 1 thing one could test additionally is to force a very high convergence in each physical timestep, i.e. usually one converges ~3 orders of magnitude in each ts -> now try converging until residual stalling in each ts. If the code versions get the same/closer results in the temporal evolution my euler wall boundary explanation would be quite reasonable.; Together with the long running unsteady simulation proposed above, I would feel more comfortable to judge. @cvencro (bringing the conversation to this place 😉 ) concerning the pitching case: the `if (dynamic_grid)` statements in the 'old' version are not necessary as that is handle",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/828#issuecomment-562621057:989,recover,recover,989,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/828#issuecomment-562621057,2,['recover'],['recover']

Availability,"Hey everyone! Just posting the results from one of the NASA TMR verification test cases I have been running: [the DSMA661](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/airfoilwakeverif500c.html). Using Least Squares (LSQ) for the gradient reconstruction does affect the results and can be seen from this force convergence plot. Using the same gradient reconstruction (GG) gives more accurate results. The two SU2 runs were done using identical linear solver parameters. The only difference is that for the GG+LSQ case, I specified : `NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON= LEAST_SQUARES` and for the GG case, I had to reduce the max CFL down to ~20 for it to get stable. . ![cfl_adap_force_convergence_dsma661_SA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30271435/68785755-7ec12380-05f3-11ea-89e3-4b93edeb9d64.png).

Availability,"Hey everyone, . Following the discussions at the SU2 Developers meeting this week, I wanted to start a conversation about compiling a comprehensive set of V&V cases for SU2 that can showcase it's performance in comparison to other solvers. . I think the the [NASA TMR website](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/index.html) is a good model to base it on. The idea would be to present the V&V case, provide working configuration and mesh files, and provide results comparing performance to other solvers and to higher fidelity data (when available). This allows people to see the performance of SU2 and replicate it, if need be. . The first step would be compiling a list of cases that should be covered. The [SU2 2014 SciTech paper](https://su2code.github.io/documents/SU2_AIAA_SciTech2014.pdf) would be a good starting point as it already had a couple of validation cases. This list can be bolstered with some of the NASA TMR cases, and with grid convergence studies. I would like to propose an initial list that the community can talk through and make changes as we see fit. I am mostly only familiar with canonical CFD flows that are used in these cases. But it would be great to have other cases, such as Turbo-machinary or FSI cases, that show the full breadth of SU2's abilities. This is by no means an exhaustive list:. 1. Zero Gradient Flat Plate; 2. 2D and 3D Bump in Channel; 3. Asymmetric Diffuser; 4. Backward facing step; 5. Unsteady Square cylinder; 6. NACA0012; 7. NACA4412 Trailing Edge Seperation; 8. Joukowski Airfoil; 9. 30P30N High Lift airfoil; 10. ONERAM6 Wing; 11. NASA CRM; 12. Subsonic and Supersonic Jets. It would be ideal for these test cases to have either high-fidelity data (wind tunnel tests, or LES/DNS data), and/or published results of other solvers so that comparisons can be made. . I also want to point out the difference between this and the TestCases repository.

Availability,"Hey guys... I just want to clarify, as there seems to be three issues being discussed:. Issue 1) SOLVED - This was related to a crash in the the `CEulerSolver::SetUpwind_Ducros_Sensor()` - This can be fixed by changing a call from GetnNeighbor() to GetnPoints() (see my comments on April 30). I don't believe this ended up being related to the overrun in the restart file (Issue 2). Issue 2) SOLVED - This was a crash when starting with very large meshes, caused by an integer overrun in `CSolver::Read_SU2_Restart_Binary()`. This issue is solved by converting the displacement variable to MPI_Aint and using `MPI_Type_create_hindexed()`, instead of `MPI_Type_indexed()`. Issue 3) This is another issue I've been seeing with large simulations: the paraview .vtu files output by SU2 are unable to be read in by Paraview. The error in Paraview is .

Availability,"Hey,. @cvencro and I were discussing this issue quite a bit this morning and here an attempt of a summary:. We are looking at the following cases:; 1. 3D Onera m6, compressible euler, including euler_wall and sym_plane ; a. steady state; b. unsteady (no pitching, deforming); 2. 2D NACA64A010, compressible euler, including euler_wall; a. unsteady (no pitching/ deformation); b. pitching (with rigid and with deforming mesh -> used for the gradient validation of @cvencro 's post ). We are rather certain that the differences between the code-versions are due to the new euler_wall boundary which was introduced in #740 (by me :) ). @cvencro did a test where the old euler_wall was simply pasted into the newer function body (which currently directly calls the sym_plane boundary) -> that recovered the results obtained with the 'older' version. The steady state results (onera m6) show that both codes deliver the same results (of course with some minor differences). So far so good. Unsteady cases are a bit trickier: the latest 2D results of @RoccoBombardieri show pretty much no difference including the first timesteps. The onera m6 case in contrast converges to the same (steady-state) results for both code version eventually but their initial transient phase differs quite significantly. . A possible explanation for the different initial transient phase: In both implementations a ""reflected state"" is constructed where the normal component of the velocity is subtracted [once in the older code version & twice in the newer version]. I.e. subtracting the normal component of velocity twice means mirroring the velocity along the symmetry plane. The newer code version is a bit ""stronger"" in enforcing the boundary conditions which could lead to the reduced oscillation in CD and CL. If we agree that both code versions produce physically correct results for steady cases and unsteady cases that were integrated long enough in time to get rid of the influence of the initial condition ... then",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/828#issuecomment-563314747:789,recover,recovered,789,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/828#issuecomment-563314747,2,['recover'],['recovered']
Availability,"Hey,. Yeah you're right, RegisterVariables was being called for ADJFLOW_SOL. Changing it so that it calls for ADJTURB_SOL throws a seg error (haven't investigated why yet). However, if I keep the RegisterVariables as is (for ADJFLOW_SOL) and instead I change the solver instance inside CDiscAdjFluidIteration::SetDependencies to solver_container[iZone][iInst][MESH_0][ADJFLOW_SOL], and try to get the value for cb1 from there, it does return the correct value. Also, the final sensitivity values become non-zero so AD is definitely doing something now. I assumed I had to use the solver_container with ADJTURB_SOL in SetDependencies since the disc_adj_turb flag inside driver_structure is set to true, and so the solver_container with ADJTURB_SOL is instantiated as a new CDiscAdjSolver during the numerics preprocessing. I guess it's a matter of consistency with the rest of the code though, so maybe my assumption was wrong.

The two options in your second step sound very interesting and I guess are the only way to get good performance for arithmetic intensive operations, like the ones in the DG solver. If I understand correctly option 1 is something that could be tried already, by applying the external function mechanism to the gemm and gemv functions (akin to what is done now for large linear systems) right? The only downside would be the creation of temporary matrices of passivedouble required to call the blas functions.; With option 2 maybe these temporaries would not be required? As there would be an active matrix class whose internal data structures would be passive matrices that could interface with blas directly?.

Availability,"Hi David,; Yes, I was able to figure out that and I went ahead in trying to make fsi_computation.py work with this branch. Another error (which may be a bug actually ) occurs when the wrapped function **SetInitialMesh()** is run. This directly involves the core of SU2 as I found out the error is given during the run of the function **CILUPreconditioner** (inside **matrix_structure.cpp**) which, as much I understood, builds the preconditioning matrix for the solution of the linear system at the base of the mesh deforming procedure. . SU2 uses by default **ILU** precoditioner whose relative function (see above) has remarkable differences from the Raven release (I didn't go too much into details). Same error I get if using **Jacobi** preconditioner. ; At contrary, everything seems fine if using **LU_SGS** preconditioner and the fsi_computation.py finally works. Maybe it's the case to point it out to the developers inveloved in this part of the code. About your last point, I'm developing at the moment some FSI features and I very much relied on fsi_computation.py in defining the interface with the SU2 core. I'm trying to keep it updated with the current version of SU2 for reliability reasons; I hope there won't be drastic changes in the python wrapping of the code! :). Thanks for the reply!.

Availability,"Hi Economon,. I encountered an issue very similar to what Auzbaig reported: the error message ""OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION: invalid option value EntropyGeneration"" during optimization with SU2. (I am using SU2 version 8.0.1 ""Harrier.""). After thoroughly examining the existing Python optimization framework, I found that one of the steps in the optimization chain is generating different config.cfg files, with a focus on DV_VALUE and OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION. DV_VALUE controls the geometry deformation;; OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION determines the type of objective/constraints.; Then the framework calls SU2_CFD and SU2_DOT to obtain performance metrics or gradient information.; As you mentioned, ""You might need to run updateHistoryMap.py to register new outputs with Python."" Initially, I thought it meant simply providing a new input for OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION in the Python optimization framework. However, it seems that this may not work at the C++ level. To verify this, I ran $ SU2_CFD your_config.cfg -d and observed all available history outputs. However, I suspect that OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION cannot use every history output, meaning that the adjoint solver might not recognize some objective functions. Does this imply that additional modifications in the C++ code are required?. Additionally, I would appreciate more information regarding CUSTOM_OBJFUNC. From TestCases/user_defined_functions/lam_flatplate.cfg, I understand that CUSTOM_OBJFUNC allows combinations of existing OBJECTIVE_FUNCTIONs and can also utilize CUSTOM_OUTPUTS. The flexibility of CUSTOM_OUTPUTS seems to enable the construction of various desired variables. However, I am unsure whether using OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION= CUSTOM_OBJFUNC along with CUSTOM_OUTPUTS can entirely replace the need for additional modifications in the C++ code. Since I’m not very proficient in C++, I would greatly appreciate your guidance.

Availability,"Hi Eduardo,. both, 'symmetry plane' and 'symmetry as the slip wall' should work in the code (upon fixing this) and it should be made clear (e.g. in the config_template.cfg) what the BC is suitable for, independent of how it is named in the end. ; The simplest solution is probably the patch I provided together with a short note in the config_template (maybe even a reference to this issue), as both 'options' will work as expected (using the very same code). It will basically 'restore' the behaviour of MARKER_SYM of before the fix in #657. The downside is some more computational cost (in case of a plane) which has to be done for each vertex on the marker. I cant say to which extend this takes more time but I would guess it is not too costly. Depends on the case as well. I can do a little check with your case here. . That's it for the diplomatic part :) (Please take the following with a grain). For me a symmetry has to be a line or plane. To cite Jiri Blazek's book 'Computational Fluid Dynamics'(...) 3rd edition using a screenshot:. ![blazekbook](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31306376/61662377-9ab05a80-acce-11e9-85bf-5998db204d92.png). The chapter is called 'symmetry plane' which already is kinda biased. But there is no 'slip wall for viscous flow' mentioned to my knowledge. In another book (from Ferziger&Peric, which I only have in german) symmetry is only used in the context of symmetry planes as well. ; To me, symmetry BC's are also linked to visualization using mirroring. And mirroring (as the word is commonly meant) is only possible along planes and its little brother, the straight line. I can be wrong or it might be a question of research background. So how to proceed? Trial by combat might have some unpleasant aftermath for the winner so we might go the democratic way and do a poll :) .

If the problem still shows up when reading the file in paraview, then it is something else. @BeckettZhou<https://github.com/BeckettZhou>, I think that for 65M elements you should not run into integer overflow issues.

Availability,"Hi Jean,; Sorry for the delay. The hypothesis I have for the less robust behavior of periodic BC's is that the linear solver is not completely aware of the periodicity. In fact after the linear solve we have to force the matching nodes to have the same value.; This is done in CFVMFlowSolverBase.hpp::CompleteImplicitIteration_impl, in the call to InitiatePeriodicComms.; The idea is to make the linear solver aware of the periodicity, to do so would require including periodic communications in the preconditioners and the matrix-vector product.; These are all in CSysMatrix.cpp, so before each of the `/*--- MPI Parallelization ---*/` bits we would need periodic comms, for preconditioners these comms would simply make the values equal, like in CSolver::InitiatePeriodicComms(PERIODIC_IMPLICIT) whereas for the matrix-vector product we need to add the values (effectively periodicity splits a row of the matrix into two ""half rows"") and this would be similar to what is done with the linear residual in CSolver::InitiatePeriodicComms(PERIODIC_RESIDUAL).; I think @TobiKattmann was also interested in having a look into this.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1467#issuecomment-1017640248:66,robust,robust,66,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1467#issuecomment-1017640248,2,['robust'],['robust']

In principle I believe that, if the changes are just in the order of 1,6e-13, it should be fine to put up the tolerance a bit just for this particular case.

You are right, and the TestCases repository is starting to be huge, mainly because of the stuff that GitHub generates to track the files. Easy to maintain/access alternatives are very welcome.

Availability,"Hi Pedro, sorry I'd forgotten to get to that one. I've just had a look through the logic again. Inside SetAiken_Relaxation, the predicted velocity is set which I think should keep the velocity update to be within the same time iteration, but if you think this still isn't actually the case let me know. Also, I've just spotted that inside Update in CFEAIteration, the logic for dynamic and/or fsi isn't complementary, so the separate ""else if"" handling for ImplicitNewmark_Relaxation isn't actually called at all. The SetDualTime_Solver which is called earlier in the same function in turn calls ImplicitNewmark_Relaxation so this hadn't been spotted earlier. I've removed the redundant else if statement... I've had to reintroduce this back since the regression tests for discadj_fsi and discadj_fsi_airfoil failed, which was a bit surprising since they are static fsi problems and the statements removed only considered problems with Newmark time integration.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1174#issuecomment-822094705:677,redundant,redundant,677,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1174#issuecomment-822094705,1,['redundant'],['redundant']
Availability,"Hi Pedro,. I tried the other solution you suggested. I declared a new private variable inside the solver class, which I assigned as config->cb1_usrdef. I registered this as the AD input. I then set a method inside the solver class which returns this value when called.; In the Numerics class, instead of reading cb1 from Config as I used to, I read it from the Solver class, using the method mentioned above.; Now I couldn't create a Solver object inside numerics_structure.inl, since according to the compilation order the solver class is dependant on the numerics class (Solver_structure.hpp includes numerics_structure.hpp). So the compiler doesn't know about the solver class while inside the numerics.; To work around the compiler error, instead I included the solver header file inside the numerics src files (cpp). I then created the solver objects in the relevant numerics functions and called the method which returns the AD-registered cb1 variable.; This all compiles now, but the AD gradient is still returned as 0. Adding print statements to the functions inside the numerics src files revealed that they are getting a cb1 value of 0, which I assume it's because solver_adjoint_discrete.cpp is called after the numerics src files have read the value of cb1, which at that point would be 0.; Would you agree that it's probably best to update the numerics classes inside the adjoint iteration class for CDiscAdjSolver, similar to what's done inside CDiscAdjFEAIteration? Is this what you meant when you referred to the elasticity solver?.

Availability,"Hi Pedro,; thanks for cleaning up Joel's code and creating the pull request. The disc_adj_fsi testcase is failing, I believe because of the relaxation. Probably you need to update the value of the test_case config and set the relaxation to 1.0 to recover the previous test. ; About the symmetric matrix class: Joel's implementation was indeed intended to populate the matrix needed for the RBF; the CSysMatrix would not be able to accommodate some terms due to the sparsity. It's well explained in the comments. Also, his implementation was only single-core. I agree that it would be very interesting to have some methods such as the cholesky decomposition available, but I think they would require some reworking (at least for parallelization).; I think this is a very valuable contribution, so it would be good to get more people on board to push it forward.; Cheers,; Ruben",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/555#issuecomment-406847760:247,recover,recover,247,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/555#issuecomment-406847760,2,"['avail', 'recover']","['available', 'recover']"
Availability,"Hi Rocco, . My approach to test with both boundary conditions was rather crude. I just pasted back the Euler wall BC that was removed in #740 . You can see what I did if you look at the change to solver_direct_mean.cpp as part of the draft PR #833 . While debugging, it is easy to rebuild the code with true/false if statement as needed to swap between the two boundary conditions. Thanks for the 2D case with no grid motion comparison you’ve run. The two boundary conditions do seem to give the same result in this case and helps narrow down the search. However, I don’t think the differences are restricted only to 3D cases because with either non-zero rigid motion grid movement or deforming mesh, there are still differences in the 2D solution.

Availability,"Hi Ruben, no worries. Integrating on the fluid side is what makes sense for matching meshes, less hassle given the availability of dual grid information, no need for MPI boiler plate, etc. The adjoint implications are being accounted for, this integration step is being recorded and overall the dependencies have not changed, the fluid nodes are still the ones defining the direction of the stress.; As you can see from the files I attached, the sensitivities are very similar for conservative/consistent interpolation cases. . It is not possible to generalise this for conservative interpolation (i.e. using the transpose of the displacement interpolation matrix to interpolate tractions) because that approach implicitly takes care of the (possible) different areas associated with fluid and solid nodes. If you transfer stresses with conservative interpolation and then integrate you get the wrong force. The conservative approach requires forces to be transferred, otherwise we start taking liberties with the meaning of the word :).

Availability,"Hi Tobi,. Great to see the same dynamic behaviour from both boundary conditions for the ONERA M6 case after the changes you've tested for the convective flux residuals. The differences seen in the dynamic results are important and since the change in boundary condition wasn't intended to cause these changes in the dynamic solution, I think we should be able to reproduce what we had originally. I think the same is also true for the problems with grid motion, as a minimum we should be able to reproduce the same result with the new boundary condition as we had with the old Euler wall. If it then comes down to choices of different convective schemes that we can employ with the new boundary condition then perhaps as further work the different available choices could be investigated to explore which option gives the most accurate result compared against references in literature?. I ran some tests for 2D cases with grid motion using both boundary conditions for us to use here. I started with the NACA64A010 airfoil @RoccoBombardieri tested, now with the pitching motion re-included, and looked at the periodic behaviour. [pitching_NACA64A010.zip](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/3963760/pitching_NACA64A010.zip). ![NACA64A010](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33747655/70848141-f7223b00-1e64-11ea-876c-0751b187fea4.png). Using the Euler wall boundary condition, the results still match exactly to @economon 's thesis (no real surprise as I suspect the code hasn't changed much for this comparison) and this agrees pretty closely with other inviscid reference results like Jamesons's unsteady flow past airfoils. With the symmetry plane, the results differ from the other inviscid solutions but the agreement to the experiment is better. I couldn't get hold of reference drag or moment results to compare against, therefore the comparison is only against lift.

Availability,"Hi Tom,. Yes, we can temporarily strip off some of the excess variables, and we may just do that in the short-term to continue the simulation. In fact, I'm not sure the averaged variables are used (is the time-averaging continued from restart, or is it started from scratch at restart?). If the time-averaged variables from the restart aren't used, then another fix would be to change what is output in the restart file vs. what is output in the visualization files (vtu, szplt, etc). Regardless, in an earlier simulation, we were attempting to run a 450 million cell mesh, which would have probably caused the same overrun with just the conservatives, so I agree that we'll have to start planning on how to deal with this issue down the road when larger meshes become more commonplace.

Availability,"Hi all, . After the initial excitement of clearing all tabs and trailing whitespaces... I guess it is more reasonable to follow @pcarruscag proposal:; > What about running the solution you propose only on subfolders? i.e. on src/something/ . I now trimmed all `C*.cpp`, `C*.hpp` and `C*.inl` files in `SU2_CFD` which is equivalent to all restructured files in the Sub-folders. I added a basic script `replace-tabs-...sh ` in `externals/utils` which provides this functionality. I would enhance that script if this is the way to go.; The commit size now shrunk down to ~4k changed lines. Possible merge problems will be much smaller. . I found to have to no problem when merging the develop first -> clearing all tabs/whitespaces in the feature_branch with the provided script -> merge this develop_noWhitespaces using the `--strategy-option=ours` option. Merge conflicts will be purely due to tabs/whitespaces therefore one always wants the own code in case of conflict, as all conflicts with the develop related to other stuff were already resolved in the first merge. . Now that the commit is a lot smaller, there should be even less problems. Maybe some folks will have no problems at all. .

Availability,"Hi all, . I recently discovered the Gust simulation capabilities of SU2 for two-dimensional Euler flows. . I am trying to implement the additional terms necessary for extending the method to 3D Navier-Stokes flows. I am running into trouble when trying to implement the changes necessary to achieve this. For now, I have began working on the two functions responsible for the gust simulations:. 1. SU2/SU2_CFD/src/iteration_structure.cpp::CFluidIteration::SetWind_GustField; 2. SU2/SU2_CFD/src/numerics/flow/flow_sources.cpp::CSourceWindGust::ComputeResidual. From what I understand the extension to 3D should simply consist in modifying the function `SetWind_GustField` to impose a 3D grid-velocity instead of a 2D grid velocity, and adding the appropriate source terms in the function `CSourceWindGust` (these can even be set to zero, just to debug the code). . However, when I try to implement these changes, I get a segmentation fault that I cannot identify. . Does someone have an idea on how to implement this feature successfully ? . PS: I have attached the modifications I made to the two functions mentioned above here:; [SetWind_GustField.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/6740388/SetWind_GustField.txt); [ComputeResidual.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/6740389/ComputeResidual.txt)",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1319:933,fault,fault,933,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1319,1,['fault'],['fault']

I would propose that all of you go through your feature branches and collect the following information about them:. - Branch name; - A two line description on the goal of the branch; - Status of the branch:; - Under active development (we are adding a new feature here); - Complete feature, (not necessarily up-to-date with develop); - In such case, latest compatible release; - Mature feature (not necessarily complete); - Test feature, still under consideration; - Test feature, discontinued; - Old feature / unknown status; - Can the branch be deleted?. This information would be very valuable, as maybe some people would be interested in continuing old developments, some repetitive work would also be avoided, and collaboration between complementary branches would be enhanced.

Availability,"Hi all, . this is the continuation of #1242 . Change of the `enum`'s in `option_structure.hpp` into `enum class`. This has the benefit of no implicit conversion to int and therefore increased safety with the enum type -> [c++ core guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#enum3-prefer-class-enums-over-plain-enums). If you want to sponsor a commit (which I highly recommend ;) ) then a good approach is to ; 1. make your `enum` of choice an `enum class` and remove the associated numbers. ; 2. Rename here if reasonable, i,.e. `ENUM_INLET_TYPE` can be just `INLET_TYPE`. Also the option names to not be redundant so e.g. `INLET_TYPE::PRESSURE_INLET_TYPE` could become `INLET_TYPE::PRESSURE`; 3. Add a `NONE` or `NO_THING` option if needed. Often the global `NONE` option is and that made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move 🧙 ; 2. then you go to `CConfig.c/hpp` and change the option type and everything there (because in the `CConfig` class the variable is usually defined). Find the `GetKind_yourOption` and search the code base for that `Get` function.; 3. Once all search results and the following function bodies are changed just compile and fix until the code builds; 4. Special care for switch statements: If not all options are present make a `default; break;` line -> otherwise the automated builds will fail on a warning (clang is used, I found gcc does only complain with an additional flag); 4. commit at best just 1 commit with a clear message and push.

Availability,"Hi all,; really interesting topic going on here. As @pcarruscag just very well explained, and after quite some time working on the code, I can totally see the need for dense algebra. . I agree with @juanjosealonso and @erangit that maintaining the code portable and very easy to install should be a must. It has been a signature of SU2 since the beginning and we should continue on that line. I've had some problems before with codes that rely heavily on PETSc, so I wouldn't particularly be keen to go down that road. . **Eigen** would be really easy to integrate in SU2: they have a mirror on GitHub here: [Eigen Github repo](https://github.com/eigenteam/eigen-git-mirror) which could be easily added as a submodule in the same way as CoDiPack or MeDiPack. Given that they are only header files, there would be no need to compile any external library. And there is another very important point made by @vdweide and @pcarruscag: we need to ensure compatibility with the discrete adjoint functionality. One huge advantage of Eigen is that is fully templated: we recently differentiated a code that was heavy reliant on Eigen in an afternoon, and it worked great. While LAPACK is indeed a very mature library, I believe that it would require using external functions for every functionality, which would be a really big burden. @talbring @MaxSagebaum could add some more hints in this discussion.

This restricts the allowable CFL number to a lower values for these scehemes. For low speed flows u may have to use smaller value of CFL with these two schemes. .

In 2D incompressible cases, the number of conservative variables is 3, so nVar = 3 and the size of Jacobian should be 3x3.

Availability,"Hi, please post the commands you are running followed by the output of meson, with all the iterations I don't understand what is going on. Meson does not care about the variables MPICC and MPICXX, it cares about CC and CXX.; It then gets the include directories and linker arguments from the pkgconfig file for MPI. If you want to bypass pkgconfig you set CC=some/path/mpicc and CXX=some/path/mpicxx, and use -Dcustom-mpi=true when calling meson.; Depending on how they are configured it may work or it may give you undefined references, in which case you can try LIBS=""-lmpi"" LDFLAGS=""-lmpi"" before running meson (or something like that, I don't know much about environment variables). If the wrappers don't find mpi.h I would ask the administrator for instructions, then after they say it is your fault and don't solve the problem (my experience with that kind of people anyway) you can try the INCLUDE or INCLUDES variable (not sure) or directly use CXXFLAGS=""-I\some\path\mpi\include"".

Availability,"Hi,. @pcarruscag , I tried few more runs (Roe Jacobians with SLAU (2)) with this case and they ran well at CFL 500 for Mach 0.1 to 0.3 at M=0.4, it dips to ~400 and I think that trend will continue downward. I ran it for Mach 0.8 and CFL was restricted to ~25.0. So it’s a very surprising/peculiar behaviour observed with this case and as you rightly said that it is good to keep both the options. . @economon , can you share any experience of first vs second order analytical Jacobians (personal work, references/papers). Working out a second order Jacobian will be a really arduous task (and there can be other specific issues related to specific schemes as well). Consistent discretization with 1st order analytical Jacobian is likely to be better than inconsistent discretization for both 1st and 2nd order accurate simulations (in general). I was curious to look at any reference showing the real/comparative gains one will have with second order accurate analytical Jacobians. Another thing, many of the commercial codes use different strategies coupled with good linear solvers to have really good convergence rates (probably I mentioned this earlier as well).

Availability,"Hi,. I am running shape optimization on the HPC ARCC cluster we have here at U of Cincinnati. Running it normally through a shell script with sbatch commands gives the following error:. ```; The application appears to have been direct launched using ""srun"",; but OMPI was not built with SLURM's PMI support and therefore cannot; execute. There are several options for building PMI support under; SLURM, depending upon the SLURM version you are using:. version 16.05 or later: you can use SLURM's PMIx support. This; requires that you configure and build SLURM --with-pmix. Versions earlier than 16.05: you must use either SLURM's PMI-1 or; PMI-2 support.

Availability,"Hi,. I am working with Eitan (""emaberman"") about this issue (lower limit). I want to strengthen a point mentioned by Eitan.; Using a specific non-dimension form available in the SU2, the hard-coded low limit values may be too high. In fact, they may interrupt the solution to reach a realizable lower value. On the other hand, using a dimension form, the current low limit is extremely low, which may hinder the convergence rate or, in the worst case, result in the solver diverging (as shown in the plots).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2323#issuecomment-2231152521:161,avail,available,161,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2323#issuecomment-2231152521,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"Hi,. Regarding the cross-diffusion term (CD) that appears in Omega source term (residual). The SST model (1994/2003) is a high-Reynolds-number model. Namely, It can not predict correctly the sub-layer region (especially the correct profile of the TKE). Therefore, only a positive contribution is required. Moreover, since the SST model was design as a k-w and k-epsilon blending, the CD term ""belongs"" only to the k-epsilon ""branch"", that is why the CD term include the factor ""1-F1"". However, it may happen, that the factor ""1-F1"" is not a 100% safe guarantee. It may happen that ""1-F1"" is not zero in region where the CD term is negative (this happen due numerical errors). To avoid such a situation, it is a good idea to clip the CD term with zero. Otherwise, severe numerical robustness issues may rise. ; Yes, it is different from Menter publications, but I think that clipping the CD term with zero is completely inline with Menter original idea (that is why, I think, he was including the factor ""1-F1"". But again the 1-F1 factor is not 100% percent ""safe"").",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2329#issuecomment-2251561287:667,error,errors,667,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2329#issuecomment-2251561287,2,"['error', 'robust']","['errors', 'robustness']"

Availability,"Hi,; I like this idea of self registering classes for our factories, although the instantiation logic is seldom as linear as converting a name to a type... Maybe you could refactor just one of our factories to give us a better idea of what it could look like?. This issue of ""modularizing"" pieces of the code is central to the refactoring of the optimization framework, which will require significant chunks of the code to be exposed to python, so by all means get involved in that (join #refactor_optimization on SU2 Slack and the developer meetings, Wednesdays at 4pm CET). Personally I think this flavour of extensibility is small fish compared to other structural problems we are currently addressing (duplication, code bloat, performance, robustness, etc.) and in my opinion addressing those issues will make it easier to extend the code in this manner, not harder.; Also from the pure C++ side I see no problem with having to modify the code... In so doing the new code is automatically under the same open source license, which to me is as good thing. A couple of practical considerations:; - About your examples, we want fewer drivers, not more. The methods of CVariable, CPoint, and co. need to be inline if the code is to have any semblance of performance.; - I think the majority of the code should still be statically linked, even if some parts of it can be extended by means of custom dynamic libraries, because that will just be less problematic for folks who build from source but are not developers. > The design I described above doesn't take into account C++ templates as I don't see them used that frequently (Is that a thing?). It is becoming a thing yes absolutely, although not at the very highest levels of abstraction. > Please, Please, we have to stop using raw pointers like that. It's being done...

Availability,"I am currently testing an expression parser to define custom fields in the config file. For this I modified the handling of the curly brackets {}. They now declare a ""literal"" interpretation, which means everything inside is considered as one string and will not be split while strings are tokenized when reading the config file. . When you declare the output fields you can then use expressions involving all available fields, e.g. `SCREEN_OUTPUT= INNER_ITER, RMS_DENSITY, {sqrt(LIFT)/DRAG**2}`. At the moment only inline expression are possible. But I am considering also to use a file to define more complex functions. The goal is to make that framework more flexibel to that we can use it also to define custom integrals over markers, functions defined on the whole flow field, custom boundary conditions, inlet conditions and so on. .

Do all the computations of flux jacobians etc. formulated in terms of gamma already rely on the ideal gas (or polytropic) assumption? . Is this sort of thing considered unimportant since SU2 is mainly intended for aerodynamics or would it be too demanding for the solver to converge reliably?. To give a ""simple"" example where this would be useful: A converging-diverging nozzle expanding the refrigerant r134a from around 24 bar to 3 bar. Only if gamma is set to the throat value the choked flow rate will be fairly correctly predicted but the outlet temperature will then be very far below the isentropic 1D result with a real EoS.

If you're not familiar with the code, there are two variants: one for ideal gases, and one for arbitrary equations of state. The code for ideal gases is not consistent with the code for arbitrary gas laws. In ``CNumerics::GetViscousProjJacs`` for the ideal gas law you'll find:; ; val_Proj_Jac_Tensor_i[4][0] += factor*proj_viscousflux_vel;; val_Proj_Jac_Tensor_j[4][0] += factor*proj_viscousflux_vel;. In ``CNumerics::GetViscousProjJacs`` for arbitrary gas laws you'll find:. val_Proj_Jac_Tensor_i[4][0] -= factor*proj_viscousflux_vel;; val_Proj_Jac_Tensor_j[4][0] -= factor*proj_viscousflux_vel;. The term is added for ideal gases, but subtracted for non-ideal gases. After deriving the Jacobian myself and having a colleague check my work, I believe that the form for arbitrary gas laws is correct. The ideal-gas law variant seems to be incorrect. Moreover, the code in `GetViscousProjJacs` could use some cleanup.

Availability,"I did a couple of changes to the discrete adjoint implementation. Despite the necessary changes in the iteration structure, the following things have been changed/added:; - It is now possible to compute Pressure, Mach and AoA sensitivities (similar to the continuous adjoint), along with this I modified the screen output.; - The computation of the geometry sensitivities is now split from the adjoint iteration itself (this saves a lot of memory and is much faster). However, this also means that geometry sensitivities are only updated just before the solution files are written.; - In some places in the code you may find the macro AD_BEGIN_PASSIVE and AD_END_PASSIVE. Everything in between is not recorded (called passive section). This is currently used for sections that are related to the construction of the flow Jacobian, since we assume that this Matrix does not depend on the flow solution, i.e. is constant. This is of course not true and leads to a very small error (~0.05% for a flow residual of 10^-4) in the sensitivities, but also increases performance a lot. Then there is a small change in solver_direct_mean.cpp:; - I moved the computation of the primitive variables in the Preprocessing routine into a separate routine (SetPrimitive_Variables). This way it is easier and there is less overhead when computing the coupling of the flow and turbulent variables needed in the discrete adjoint solver.

Availability,"I do not know if it exists already and /or if it is planned at all. In the case it does not exist it would be good to have output information on global energy balances at hand. This specifically applies to CHT multizone computations, but not only. **Describe the solution you'd like**; The energy balance should take care about delta enthalpy between inlet(s) and outlet(s). That can be compared to the heat transferred across the wall(s). So in a steady simulation with one inlet, one outlet and a wall the balance global balance should be zero. When working e.g. on a heat exchanger designs could also be compared with respect to their performance (e.g. NTU numbers or similar). This could be specifically interesting for multizone examples.

Availability,"I don't think the fix is as simple as it seems.; Indeed looking back at how we developed the CGNS reader, It was originally meant to read multiple zone in a single file. But during development, someone decided to restrict the reader to only one zone per file (and I don't know if it was validated). So now we are seating in the middle. If we replace line 169 of CGNSFVMMeshReader :; <pre>; if ( nzones > 1 ) {; SU2_MPI::Error(string(""CGNS reader currently expects only 1 zone per CGNS file."") +; string(""Multizone problems can be run with separate CGNS files for each zone.""), CURRENT_FUNCTION);; }; </pre>; by; <pre>; if ( cgnsZone > nzones) {; cgnsZone = 1;; }; </pre>. we can easily support multiple zone in one file. To support one CGNS zone per file, I guess that user should provide either the index in the cgns file of the zone we want to read or even better its name and not rely on SU2 numbering of zones. I think that supporting multiple mesh zones in the same file at the same time as one zone per mesh file should be possible as long as enough information is provided by the user. In this case, I am wondering how the option MULTIZONE_MESH and MULTIZONE option are interacting in the related issue. When MULTIZONE_MESH is set to NO do we expect one mesh file per zone ?; And in this case we can force CGNS Reader to read only the first Zone. In a more generic way something like this should be possible:; MULTIZONE=YES; CONFIG_LIST= (zone_1.cfg, zone_2.cfg, zone_3.cfg); CGNSZONENAMES = (""FluidRotor"", ""Solid"", ""FluidStator"") # To let CGNS pick the right zone in the file and if it not found the first zone can be used (current SU2 behavior).

Availability,"I haven't explicitly checked if they match but for the rigid motion cases the grid velocity is calculated from the transformation matrices and then imposed to update the grid. Therefore if the grid velocities are back calculated from the grid using FD then I would expect them to be close but not exact. For a pitching airfoil case with FFD design variables, the average difference in gradients for an objective function of L/D was within 1% between discrete adjoint and finite differences. This is very similar for both imposed grid velocities in the adjoint preprocessing and with the FD calculation for the grid velocities. So I think the results are pretty reliable for the rigid motion cases using the updated grid velocities calculation. . The deforming grid on the other hand is a different story. I still haven't been able to complete an adjoint run without diverging.

Availability,"I just pushed a new version of your inlet profile branch. I really like the solver class abstractions. I can tell you have a good grip on the classes and where data should live - nice job. Here are the changes I have made:; * everything is generalized in parallel for an arbitrary number of inlets in the file. The file format changed slightly.; * I moved around some routines and data to take more advantage of inheritance and encapsulation: it is now more like the restart routines where the reading and data live in the parent CSolver class, the specific load functions are found in the solvers (I overloaded SetInletAtVertex), and the template file is written by COutput. It is written such that any solver could eventually use it for any marker type by adding the appropriate SetInletAtVertex routine for solver-specific data (might need to rename for different marker types rather than inlet) and writing an appropriate template file writer in the output.; * for now, it is still requiring a essentially a matching profile point (nearest neighbor within a tight tolerance) by default, but you can have an arbitrary number of points in the file for each marker, and we can eventually add interpolation easily. We already have some of these routines.; * the turbulent solvers now all use the Inlet_TurbVars data structure even for uniform inlets. Can you please check this with Python?; * multigrid is now working. I put in a boundary face area-averaged restriction operator for the inlet profiles. Any decent approximation on the coarse levels should work ok. I left all of your original routines there, but deactivated them for the moment.

Availability,"I noticed there was a lot of duplicate code in the turbulent numerics files (`numerics_structure.hpp` and `numerics_direct_turbulent.cpp`). Since I'm working with new model equations for hybrid RANS/LES, I didn't want to add to the technical debt. So I decided to refactor the turbulence numerics using the [template design pattern](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/template_method). Basically, I moved common behavior for the viscous and the upwinding residuals to respective base classes and then left the specifics of each model to derived classes. I did my best to not change any of the underlying behavior. The source residual calculations for SST and SA have little in common. I did not apply the template design pattern to them. I named the template classes `CUpwSca_Abstract` and `CAvgGrad_Abstract` because the `_Template` suffix was already taken. I also noticed that there were almost no difference between the old `CAvgGrad_` classes and the `CAvgGradCorrected_` classes. The gradient correction is such a small change that it's better to have a single class with a switch than two classes that are about 95% similar. So I added a boolean property and logical switching if correction is to be applied to the gradients. This boolean parameter is now a parameter for the constructor.

Availability,"I propose adding a unit-testing framework and unit-tests to SU2. After chatting with @economon, I've decided to move the discussion here to get additional input. ## What is unit testing?. For those not familiar with unit testing, unit testing allows the testing of small bits of behavior, ideally using isolated bits of code. It is not intended to replace validation testing or formal verification tests. Instead, it serves a unique purpose. Consider the three following use cases:. + You're developing a new feature, and you want to test it to see if it works. You could do a full simulation, but that takes a lot of time and computing power. You want to check if your new behavior behaves as you suspect before you throw a lot of resources at it.; + You submit a PR and discover that one of the regression tests has failed. But...why? You know that something is broken, but its hard to track down what broke. You want more granular test coverage that can demonstrate what broke.; + You are fixing a very small bug. You know that you should prove that your bug fix worked, but it doesn't seem logical to dedicate an entire validation case to one small bug fix. You want to write a small test for a small fix. In all of these cases, unit testing fills a unique role. Unit testing increases time spent in development, but decreases the amount of time spent in bug-fixing and maintaining. For more information, see this [relevant Stack Exchange question.](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/206/is-it-worthwhile-to-write-unit-tests-for-scientific-research-codes). ## What do I propose?. Our research group at UT Austin has implemented a unit testing framework on our branch, which we're happy with. Some choices were arbitrary, and some choices were made based on our development environment. Those choices may be different for other groups. Here's what we have done:. The unit testing framework is compiled and run using autotools.

Availability,"I'll try and find some time to have a look at this today. I think the issue is in the `jSpan == nSpanDonor - 1`. The final value in both the donor and target arrays are 1D values, the values at nSpanDonor - 2 are the values at the shroud. I think the original proposed fix is still needed here as further down you have an array accessing a postion of `kSpan + 1` which iirc resulted in the memory access violation. I think what has happened here is the Aachen case triggers this condition, and results in an error in the calculation of the coefficient for the linear interpolation. When we fixed it, we changed the simulation enough that it throws the residuals off as the computational problem is inherently different. A good test for this would be to extract the values at the interface from the turbomachinery special output with and without this change to see if this is the case.

Availability,"I'll try to break down each request to make it clearer. Request: Use nomenclature consistent with the C++ interface (point instead of node, etc.); Reason: People who know the C++ interface will know how to use the python wrapper straight away, people who learn how to use the python wrapper will be able to understand the C++ implementation (without needing a translation layer in their mind all the time). Request: Return connectivity/adjacency as local indices instead of global; Reason: This is the natural way of referencing data in an MPI code, local indices correspond directly to data stored in the partition thereby making it more efficient to access (without global-to-local conversions, which are much more expensive than local-to-global). Furthermore, the local ordering strategy improves the efficiency of loops (over edges, neighboring points, etc.). Request: Do not apply unnecessary ""transformations"" to the connectivity/adjacency as part of the API; Reason: Increases the maintenance burden and makes for a less versatile API. By returning the local indices that form a marker or element, it is trivial to retrieve any other data for those indices (the ""transformation""). For example, the solution at those points, the point coordinates, whether the points are halo or domain points, the global indices, etc.; This way, by adding a **single** function to the API e.g. get the global index of a point of element, the functionality of the API grows a lot more because the user can apply the function to **any** connectivity/adjacency function. Request: Do not offer too many overloads of the same function; Reason: Increases the maintenance burden and it's returning the data in structures that are not very efficient, namely vector of vectors. It is much easier to offer domain-wide data access on the python side, as a very small function that can be part of wrapper utilities (i.e. live only in python but not c++).

Availability,"I'm the one who created that warning message, so I can fill in some details about when and why that error message occurs. For adaptive mesh refinement, SU2 looks at each element and checks how important it would be to divide that element. It then assigns a numeric value (a ""sensor"") to each element representing the relative importance. That sensor is normalized by the max value and is assumed to be positive, so its range should be from 0 to 1. SU2 defines a number of elements that it wants to create (4455 in your case). It then loops through all the elements and looks for elements whose sensors fall above a threshold. That threshold starts at 0.999, close to the max value of 1. If an element has a sensor above that threshold, SU2 marks that cell for division. If it doesn't find enough elements, then it lowers the threshold and continues looking. That process continues all the way down till the threshold hits 0. Sometimes, SU2 can't find enough elements to adapt. The threshold goes all the way to 0, and there's still not enough. Then it prints that warning and continues. That's what you're seeing. The code only mentions triangles, quadrilaterals, and tetrahedrons as a guess to what's wrong. You'll notice it says your grid ""may"" have too high a percentage of other types. If your grid were composed solely of hexahedrons, for example, then it won't find any elements to adapt and print that warning message. There's no check to confirm that this guess is actually correct. In your case, you only have quads and triangles, so the guess is obviously mistaken. As to what is actually going wrong in your case, I would have to dig in a little deeper to find out what's going on. I would guess that your elements aren't being marked as ""divisible,"" but I'm not sure why.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/606#issuecomment-434924444:100,error,error,100,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/606#issuecomment-434924444,2,"['down', 'error']","['down', 'error']"

Availability,"I've recently run into a problem with periodic geometry when I run a RANS problem on 16 cores or more (256+ MPI tasks). While initializing the Jacobian structure for the turbulence model, I run into one of two errors, depending on the core count. The first error results in the following error message:; ```; Fatal error in MPI_Sendrecv: Message truncated, error stack:; MPI_Sendrecv(249).................: MPI_Sendrecv(sbuf=0x2ee74f0, scount=10, MPI_DOUBLE, dest=19, stag=0, rbuf=0x2ee68e0, rcount=385, MPI_MPIDI_CH3U_Receive_data_found(144): Message from rank 25 and tag 0 truncated; 3200 bytes received but buffer size is 3080; aborting job; ```. The second error just leads to the solver hanging indefinitely at the `Initialize Jacobian structure (SA model)` step. I'm guessing that an MPI send/receive is left dangling. I have not seen these problems at lower core counts (2-4 cores with 2-32 MPI tasks). **The errors seem to be tied to the way the periodic send/receives are set up.** If I change the periodic boundaries to far-field boundaries, the error vanishes. I've also done a lot of work to weed out possible causes:. + I've generated the meshes using both `SU2_MSH` and the `su2perio` Fortran tool.; + I've run this on two different supercomputers, with different MPI builds.; + I've tested multiple different meshes with different resolutions.; + I've tried changing the RANS model and steady/unsteady options.; + I've even used a different solver (our hybrid solver) that's completely independent of the RANS solver classes. Same error.; + The problem occurs whether you're restarting or starting without a restart file. I've got a minimal example that you can use to test this for yourself, in the attached files.

Availability,"I've tracked down the source of the bug, and I'll submit a pull request later today. During the output of the periodic mesh in `SU2_MSH`, `CPeriodicGeometry::SetMeshFile` sorts the nodes into the order normal, receive, send. This can be found in [lines 18798-18819 of Common/src/geometry_structure](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/blob/68991cd1005cf118e1ff21b8952bb366bb299cf3/Common/src/geometry_structure.cpp#L18798). I've copied down the lines here for reference:. ```cpp; /*--- Change the numbering to guarantee that the all the receive; points are at the end of the file ---*/; unsigned long OldnPoint = geometry->GetnPoint();; unsigned long *NewSort = new unsigned long[nPoint];; for (iPoint = 0; iPoint < nPoint; iPoint++) {; NewSort[iPoint] = iPoint;; }; ; unsigned long Index = OldnPoint-1;; for (iMarker = 0; iMarker < nMarker; iMarker++) {; if (bound[iMarker][0]->GetVTK_Type() == VERTEX) {; if (config->GetMarker_All_SendRecv(iMarker) < 0) {; for (iElem_Bound = 0; iElem_Bound < nElem_Bound[iMarker]; iElem_Bound++) {; if (bound[iMarker][iElem_Bound]->GetNode(0) < geometry->GetnPoint()) {; NewSort[bound[iMarker][iElem_Bound]->GetNode(0)] = Index;; NewSort[Index] = bound[iMarker][iElem_Bound]->GetNode(0);; Index--;; }; }; }; }; }; ```. In order to sort the points, a list mapping the old points to the new points (`NewSort`) is created. The problem is that this list is sorted by switching nodes. But it doesn't switch around the _contents_ of the list (i.e. two node numbers from the list). Instead it switched an index from the list and an actual node number pulled from the geometry. This presents two problems:. 1. If any of the receive nodes actually are at the end of the list, they will get switched away from the end of the list.; 2. If any node is switched twice, data is lost. That's because the sorting assumes that the elements being switched have not already been switched. This is how the three points went missing from the cube problem I previously referenced.

You may consider creating some interpolation functions (with all the safeguards and error codes) in C++ based on the SUmb code (which was structured in a C++-like way) or at least take inspiration from that approach to identify interpolation utilities / libraries in C++ that could be used for the same purpose.

I changed the `SU2_MPI::Error` routine to give a return status of `EXIT_FAILURE` instead of `0`. Since `0` is conventionally defined as a successful program exit, returning `EXIT_FAILURE` makes more sense than returning `0` when `SU2_MPI::Error` is called. So why did that change cause the regression tests to fail? My suspicion is that these two tests have been exiting with an error for some time, but these regressions were not picked up by Travis since SU2 kept on returning `0` (i.e. success). Changing the exit code of `SU2_MPI::Error` doesn't cause any errors, but it will expose errors that are (sometimes silently) occurring. @pcarruscag I think you added these tests.

See also below for some images. Note though that the definition of the heat-transfer/convection bc above in the PR-header is not correct. the heatflux computes to:. `q=h (T_infinity - T_wall)` with. `h` the the heat transfer coefficient (to be set in config by the user). `T_infinity` the reference temperature at infinity (to be set in config by the user). `T_wall` the the current local temperature of the specific FV-cell (of course done by the code).

Availability,"In principle yes, but there are a few complications for coupling everything which made me take a step back:; - The way the different solvers treat the linear system solution is not consistent, e.g. SST does not use it directly, which means the Jacobian-vector product would not be consistent.; - Scaling, this uses finite differences to compute a directed derivative, if the variables have very different magnitudes the error will be large.; - Conditioning, the residual Jacobian is very ill-conditioned it is difficult to solve systems with it at high CFL, and if CFL is low there is not much point in having the true Jacobian...; - Speed, each matrix-free product means one evaluation of the convective and viscous residuals, for schemes that are not vectorized yet this costs a lot which means the quasi-Newton approach will be faster even if it takes more iterations.

Availability,"It seems like your situation may have been resolved, but for archival purposes, I'll list my workaround here. This problem occurs when you've installed python packages in two different locations. This could be due to installing some python packages in a system directory (e.g. `/usr/lib/`) and some in a user directory (e.g. `~/.local/`). SU2's build process is set to automatically detect the default package location, but it's not equipped to handle multiple package locations. There are some hardcoded includes, but these only work for python 2.7. I don't consider this a bug *per se* because multiple python package directories is not a standard use case. #### The symptoms. When building SU2 with the python wrapper you'll see the following error during the swig build:; ```; <install directory>/../SU2_PY/pySU2/pySU2.i:64: Error: Unable to find 'mpi4py/mpi4py.i'; ```; But mpi4py is indeed installed on your system and it's on your python path, as confirmed by opening a python terminal and running `import mpi4py`. #### The easiest workaround. Switch to a [virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). This will ensure that all of your python packages are stored in single location. #### Alternate workaround. In this method, you change the hardcoded includes to match mpi4py's package location. First I figure out where my mpi4py is installed. I start a terminal session of python using the python environment I want to use (in this case, it's python 3.6), and then run:; ```; from mpi4py import MPI; MPI; ```. Since I have mpi4py installed on your system and it's on my python path, I see something like:; ```; <module 'mpi4py.MPI' from '/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mpi4py/MPI.cpython-34m.so'>; ```. The `/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python3.6/` directory is where my mpi4py package is installed. But the swig compile command includes `/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python2.7/`. That's not the right directory!

Availability,"It should be emphasized that we do not modify nor change the model formulation (terms, constants, coefficients, etc.) The Lower limit clipping of K and omega used currently in SU2 are not a part of the model formulation. It is a numerical fix to avoid negative values. To the best of our knowledge there is no formal lower limit given by Mentor or anyone else and current values in SU2 are taken arbitrarily.

Availability,"Let me begin by saying ""Thank you so, so much for your time and efforts to write SU2 and then distribute as open source!"" . I now wish to make a complaint -- as far as I can tell there is not even a command manual for SU2. I think this should be a requirement for SU2. Tutorials are not enough:. > SU2 includes strict error checking of the config file upon execution of one of the C++ modules. For example, the code **will throw errors if unknown options are specified**, options appear more than once, extra text appears outside of comments, etc. A user should be able to reference a single document to find command syntax and options. As an excercise, I ""tried"" to use a dd-ilut preconditioner with 2 submatrices, symmetric overlap, a drop-tolerance of 1e-4, and a fill of 1.3, with a GMRES solver utilizing a modified Gram-Schmidt orthoganolization, kspace of 30, and RCM reordering... SU2 failed. Ok, so I didn't _actually_ try to do this, but if I were to try this how would I know SU2 _couldn't_ use this? To fill in this exercise I accessed the Trilinos Aztec User Manual: https://trilinos.org/oldsite/packages/aztecoo/AztecOOUserGuide.pdf which, while it doesn't attempt to tell me _what_ a krylov subspace is, at least tells me that I can and how to use the argument _AZ_kspace_. Then as a user I can google _GMRES kspace_ to find the theory / explanation if I so choose. Can this be a thing? At least a text document with commands and allowed arguments?",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/183:318,error,error,318,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/183,3,"['error', 'toler']","['error', 'errors', 'tolerance']"
Availability,"Let me recall the other sub-issues reported by @suargi:. **Third issue**; > After solving the previous issues, with mpirun and depending on the number of cores to be used SU2 will still produce a segmentation fault when using Full MG. This problem is not present when using mpiexec. I traced it back and found that in CFVMFlowSolverBase<V, FlowRegime>::Friction_Forces the method GetNormal_Neighbor() from CVertex returns a non existing point. I was able to partially reproduce this with @suargi's help, by modifying `SU2/TestCases/rans/rae2822/turb_SA_RAE2822.cfg`, setting MGLEVEL=6 (instead of 3) and MGCYCLE=FULLMG_CYCLE (instead of W_CYCLE). This could become the new regression test by the way. Both with `mpirun -n 3` and `mpiexec -n 3` we observed non-existing point IDs of the normal neighbor. In #1430 I describe what I think is the problem. For `mpirun -n 2` and `mpiexec -n 2` I get another kind of error, I'll further investigate this. We did not see a difference in behaviour of `mpirun` and `mpiexec` on my system however. **Edit**: My version are `mpirun (Open MPI) 4.1.0` and `mpiexec (OpenRTE) 4.1.0`. **Fourth issue**; > Further, this parameter, Convergence_FullMG, is set to false in CIntegration::CIntegration() and never updated i.e., there is no evaluation whether the FullMG has converged or not.

The problem is that depending on the actual MPI implementation (so for example MPICH, openmpi etc.) send buffer arguments might be declared as const or not. Unfortunately, there is no (easy) way to get that information automatically. It might be even different between versions of openmpi (on travis it is v1.6.5 and its necessary, locally I have v3.x, and its not)... so for now it is trial and error whether this is necessary or not.

Availability,"My goal is to have a simple pressure pulse propagate within the domain to ensure my setup is not wrong (boundary conditions, axisymmetry etc). The procedure I follow:; - I set the reference conditions to a quiscent flow condition. ; - Then have SU2 write a RESTART_ASCII file.; - I then modify this ASCII file to now have a Gaussian pressure pulse at the domain center.; - Next, I ask SU2 to read this restart_file.csv as the solution_file.; - However, the very next iteration from SU2 using this initial condition (IC) is a quiescent one. ; - I have tried different solvers and time steps and CFL numbers to no avail. ; - I suspect my configuration file is time stepping away from the pulse IC so quickly that there is no evidence of it in the next time steps I have SU2 write. .

Availability,"My previous post used a linear solver precision of 1E-6. I ran a couple of test cases at near machine precision (a linear solver tolerance of 1E-14) and higher CFL number (CFL=150), with no CFL adaptation. As suggested, I used ILU+FGMRES. I capped the maximum number of linear solver iterations at 200, and did not raise any errors if the linear solver stopped at 200 iterations with less than 1E-14. The linear solver didn't exceed 200 iterations for the RANS equations, but it did for the Navier-Stokes equations. Once again, there doesn't appear to be a huge difference. For the flat-plate, the results were almost identical:. ![flat_plate_improved](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13340225/35233993-595fe2d4-ff65-11e7-9fd6-4b98f30b4d75.png).

I believe overall convergence was similar because the Navier-Stokes solver, not the turbulence-solver, is the limiting factor when it comes to precision. The linear solver always converged on a turbulence solution with high precision in under 50 linear solver iterations. Meanwhile, the linear solver sometimes failed to find a Navier-Stokes solution within 1E-14 even after 200 iterations. The only way to make the Navier-Stokes solver converge to 1E-14 was to use small time steps (CFL ~= 1) at difficult points in the overall convergence.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/491#issuecomment-359811658:129,toler,tolerance,129,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/491#issuecomment-359811658,2,"['error', 'toler']","['errors', 'tolerance']"

Availability,"Nice post @pcarruscag : I think we can gain a lot by first breaking up the files, especially the headers, and then being much better about include statements. In particular, we can look at forward declarations, using more guards, and just minimizing the number of includes (I expect some are redundant). As far as breaking up the files, I think geometry is a good place to start. I can take a shot at this first soon. . More ideas out there?

Availability,"Nice progress @pcarruscag!. I like the concept of your SIMD-friendly class that will take care of the data structure under the hood coupled with a standard type of loop statement (w/ +SIMDLEN). This should make it pretty easy for folks to still modify the kernels without having to worry about the data alignment, and they can reuse the same simple 'for' construct repeatedly. . Another reason to have our own lightweight class for this is that you can avoid dependence on OpenMP for SIMD (although that feature looks to have potential and wasn't available until somewhat recently) as well as the intrinsics. In my experience, the latter is especially bad for portability and readability (part of why we left the CaF work in a separate repo). It starts to become so specialized that compiling and modifying become difficult. W.r.t. OpenMP, another roadblock there a few years ago was making sure it is interoperable with CoDi for the adjoint, but I know this has been worked on and may be available by now. Might keep an open mind about point vs. edge. In some places, we may be able to pump up the compute in our loops by fusing kernels, as previously discussed (and I am guessing you are working on this already with gradients/limiters). Could change the final performance numbers significantly. Lastly, I know you are not there yet, but it is worth considering whether you can reuse anything you are developing in the kernels here for the linear solver routines. At some point, you will successfully reduce the cost of the residual kernels (RHS) to the bandwidth limit, and the majority of the iteration cost will be in the linear solver (it is already about 50% of the iteration cost before optimization, if I recall). Before making final decisions on strategy, you should consider if it will help in any of the linear solver routines too.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-530440072:547,avail,available,547,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-530440072,4,['avail'],['available']

Availability,No. I tried a couple of things but ran into problems with both of them and I haven't done anything about it since. The first was to use one of the old MPI routines (like Set_MPI_ActDisk) to couple the two faces so they can communicate the residuals with each other. This was quite cumbersome and I did not want to copy paste large chunks of code. The other one was to set the two faces as periodic boundaries with zero distance between them but if I remember correctly this did not work because the MatchPeriodic routine gave an error back then.

Availability,"On the subject of virtual functions I would like to put another idea forward.; After moving things around in #725 I noticed that we have tons of `inline virtual` methods.; The keyword `inline` has two meanings to the compiler:; - ""Dear merciful compiler please copy paste the body of this function and then do all your wonderful optimizations, if that pleases your excellency.""; - ""Dear forgiving compiler, you will find this method defined in multiple units, please don't be mad"" (i.e. ignore the one-definition-rule). `virtual` means determine what version of the method to call at runtime. This is not compatible with the first (and often the intended one) meaning of inline, therefore the compiler will in general not inline those methods.; They will only be inlined if they are being called on a pointer to the derived class that does not declare the method to be virtual anymore. CSolver knows what variables it creates and so in hot areas of the code it could do a static downcast to allow inlining (e.g. `static_cast<CEulerVariable*>(node[iNode])->DoStuff()`).; Where is this important? For example when computing gradients, where simple additions and subtractions are hidden behind virtual functions.; If you are worried about maintenance each solver can typedef its most safe downcast level or better yet (or just more modern), methods that could benefit from this can be templated for the type of downcast.; Those in favour say Yea those against say Nay.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/716#issuecomment-509273008:979,down,downcast,979,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/716#issuecomment-509273008,8,"['down', 'mainten']","['downcast', 'maintenance']"

Availability,"Our proposal does not relate to the SST's good behavior (iThe SST model is not sensitive to Omega freestream value: it is because of the addition of the cross-diffusion term, which was absent in the original Wilcox model). The current implicit treatment in the SU2 may generate a negative solution that is not physical. A low limit value is available in the code to avoid a negative solution. This means the solution is clipped to this value if the solution reaches a lower value. There is no single absolute low-limit value that is suitable, for example, issues with dimension vs. non-dimension form. Our proposal circumvents this problem. The current situation in the code is not robust. We suffer from many robustness issues, especially with the SST2003 model. However, using our proposal significantly enhanced the solver's robustness. The current situation is like a ""bug"" because it may interfere with the solution. We understand that our idea requires a lot of effort and that it would make the code unreproducible. Therefore, we would like to suggest the following: Give the user an option to control these low-limit values. The default values will be according to the hard-coded values. We also strongly recommend adding additional user low-limit values control according to our proposal. The user will be able to decide which option he prefers. Our end goal is to design the implicit treatment so that these low-limit controls will be almost redundant. Based on several publications I've made during the last 15-20 years, my code enjoys this feature.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2323#issuecomment-2231452852:341,avail,available,341,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2323#issuecomment-2231452852,5,"['avail', 'redundant', 'robust']","['available', 'redundant', 'robust', 'robustness']"
Availability,"Our proposed changes implicitly include 2 modifications to current code: ; The first is the modification of the lower limit such that it should be relative to a reference value. The rational for this is that a single given hard coded number cannot be correct for possible all flow regimes. Moreover, even running the same case in dimensional and non dimensional form, will lead to different behaviour of the lower limit. The proposed solution therefore is defining a limit relative to reference values, namely:; k_low_limit = C_k * K_infinity; w_low_limit = C_w * W_infinity. This change will inevitably cause changes to current behaviour (as can be seen in test case results), but we believe it is more correct. . The second, is giving the user control over C_k and C_w and the choice of the default value. As mentioned above, the behaviour of the proposed default value will inevitably be different than the existing one. Even if we choose default values that will lead to similar values to those existing for a certain case this would not be true for other cases. Therefore no default value can be given to reconstruct the current solver behaviour. ; The values suggested as default are not the most correct per se, but rather robust suggestions based on experience and are open to discussion. Optimal default values of different cases, say external and internal flows are expected to be different, this is why we felt it important to allow user control of the lower limit. . We emphasise that the solution used in SU2 of applying a lower limit to turbulence variables in order keep the solution positive is somewhat artificial, and future features we are working on should minimize the need for such a treatment, however, as long as this is the solution implemented, we believe that the proposed change is more correct, leading to more robust behaviour.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2323#issuecomment-2230214740:1230,robust,robust,1230,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2323#issuecomment-2230214740,2,['robust'],['robust']

Availability,"Restructuring of the test cases to separate the config files (now in SU2 repo) from the mesh/solution data (remain in the TestCases repo). The idea is that developers will update their config files along with their code changes in the SU2 repo so that pull requests can be automatically checked with Travis CI. The meshes and solution data, which change much less frequently and are larger files, remain in the TestCases repo. The two repositories contain the same directory structure for the test cases, with complementary (not overlapping) file sets. The responsibility is on the developer to add files to both repositories (in matching directory locations) when adding new test cases. This makes it very easy for one to recombine the full set of files or for Travis CI to do this automatically. To run the test cases locally, one might do the following (assuming paths are set correctly so SU2_CFD is available):. ```; $ git clone https://github.com/su2code/SU2.git; $ git clone https://github.com/su2code/TestCases.git; $ cd SU2/; $ ./configure; $ make install; $ cp -R ../TestCases/* ./TestCases/; $ cd ./TestCases/; $ python serial_regression.py; ```.

We can recover that formulation using a large number for Nu (DEFORM_COEFF). The code has been simplified and that IO is now more clear. I have performed some tests and large deformations are now possible. . However, systematic regression tests for grid deformation is required using all the different kinds of elements. I remember that T. Economon put together some basic grids to test the mesh deformation, we should use those to check that everything is working fine before closing the release.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/278:571,recover,recover,571,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/278,1,['recover'],['recover']

In the sense that we create a develop branch, create branches for any cases we want to add, submit pull requests that can be reviewed by the rest of the community etc. . I like the idea from @bigfooted, of having some regression testing that can run the simulation for a couple of iterations and check residuals (identical to what we do for the TestCases). This might be redundant to the actual regression tests that are done in SU2, but would be an easy first check on weather a particular validation case needs to be run again. Ideally, this would be run before any major version releases, as we discussed earlier. . I can also start working on creating a section on the website for the results of the validation cases.

Availability,"Sorry for the late reply, here are some personal opinions. (1) I have also test the turb flatplate and Onera M6 case (Fig1.Original; Fig2.Submit) in the tutorials. The convengence and results also shows just slightly difference. . (2) This PR is not suitable for the euler wall, for the wall is not always a straight plane and singular points do not statisfy the condition for the normal direction is hard to define. (3) Well, I have noticed the BC_Sym_Plane before, but it is very puzzling to me that only the closed point to the vertex on the sym wall is considered to add additional negative normal flux contribution. Maybe the mesh is unstructured and more than one point out of wall is linked to the vortex. Maybe the closed point is not normal to the wall while it always occurs on the 3D sym plane such as the ONERA M6 wing case. (4) This PR is to add a limitation of the velocity on the sym wall, just like what we do to the turb walls in the CTurbSSTSolver::CTurbSSTSolver(CGeometry *geometry, CConfig *config, unsigned short iMesh).

Availability,"Summary; ========; The **fluid interface** connects RANS zones in such a way that flow can freely pass through it just as if they were a single RANS zone. We (@maxaehle, @BeckettZhou) observed convergence problems in cases where the meshes had ""boundary-layer-like"" high anisotropy at the fluid interface. However a singlezone simulation, for which the meshes are joined together, converged.

In this issue I consider compressible flow around a circle at Re=1e6, Mach=0.15, using the SST turbulence model. The radial mesh has a boundary layer at the circle of radius 1 (adiabatic wall), and a ""boundary-layer-like"" structure around a circle of radius (approximately) 4. Having this ""boundary-layer-like"" structure does not make sense here, but in our project we later want to change the area `1<=radius<=4` to a ""porous material"" zone and this would introduce a boundary layer there. Both the [attached](https://seafile.rlp.net/d/bb0fbb16eb414263b642/) `issue_complicated.zip`, `issue_simplified.zip` contain subdirectories `singlezone`, `multizone`.

Availability,"Thank you for your comment. No need to create dummy points for periodic BC is really an ingenious design and when I run RANS/URANS cases, I get good results. But there are still some problems for me, the first is convergence when I run big 3D cases and the second is the periodic BC cannot cooperate with hybrid RANS/LES method. So I thought a dummy layer is sometimes necessary just as in Blazek's book(Computational Fluid Dynamics: Principles and Applications, Second Edition, Page 293). ; ![book](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/assets/58663453/cd5a29ba-4f75-40a0-8530-edfd1523d9b7). One dummy layer need to communicate solution, gradients or maybe Laplacian, sensors and so on. It's still complex so I choose two dummy layers to only communicate solution. As in the picture, the original use the send-recieve pair1 as periodic BCs and this feature need four pairs with a restriction that the outermost four layers should be structured grids. Three more repeated mesh sections are indeed added but it is acceptable in terms of robustness and reducing data communication.; ![pairs](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/assets/58663453/1d7c5005-b704-40a6-88dd-518e09082eea). The above diagram can be set with the following settings:; MARKER_PERIODIC= ( y0.48, y0.04, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.44, 0.0, y0, y0.44, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.44, 0.0 ); PERIODIC_DUMMY= YES.

Availability,"Thanks Edwin, the vectorized loops in the code are probably very simple array copies, hence the low efficiency? I would put money on not a single vector instruction being generated for the important stuff. I was surprised by the 1.25 to 1.3 factor you are seeing, for the exact same case I measured 1.39 (to be more precise). Initially I thought it had something to do with running single core, thus leaving vast amounts of L3 for only that core to use, so on the same 24c platform I ran 2 processes (30MB of cache for each) (very uncivilised) and the factor went down to 1.37, so cache was not the reason.; So then I thought maybe the Intel compilers are very good at optimizing polymorphism away, but the development branch compiled with icc 17 runs at exactly the same speed as when compiled with gcc 5.4. Then I compiled feature_contiguous_cvariable with icc 17 and it runs 9% slower than the gcc binaries, and so with icc 17 the speedup for this case was 1.27 errrrr...

Availability,"Thanks Tom. And, as mentioned before, let’s have a bit of a discussion as to which wall functions formulations would make most sense to implement.

The adaptive wall function trick is quite useful as it makes the wall function implementation more robust to the varying y+ of the first cell of the surface of the geometry and lessens the burden during the grid generation stage.

Availability,"Thanks for fixing the alignment.; With those options the code actually looks ok in areas that were recently cleaned up.; But the need for the manual formatting we have in loads of places comes from having code that is far too verbose and repetitive e.g. 10 calls to MPI routines with tons of arguments, 10 operator [] in a single line to get to the CSolver we need, entire copy pasted sections that should be functions, etc..; I am not a fan of that kind of wholesale automatic change because it does not fix any of the structural problems we have, and it tends to make the fixing of those issues harder because the aforementioned problematic areas are usually less readable after such changes.; I like the optimization approach of making small gradual improvements, but unfortunately this kind of maintenance is not very glamorous and few of us are up for it...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/969#issuecomment-625436086:798,mainten,maintenance,798,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/969#issuecomment-625436086,1,['mainten'],['maintenance']

As for the capabilities of the incompressible solver, you can assume many of them from the compressible solver were not actually available/working. Things like harmonic balance, grid motion, rotating frame, etc. need to be implemented properly in the new standalone solver for the incompressible version.

Availability,"Thanks for the detailed analysis... out of curiosity, how tightly did you converge the linear solve with each nonlinear iteration? . Lately, we have seen that the ILU preconditioner performs best, and, when solving the linear systems to a smaller tolerance, one can often use a higher CFL number. It could be interesting to look at the convergence of the linear solve for a single nonlinear iteration (at different points of the calculation) for GMRES+ILU to a near machine precision tolerance both with and without the term in the Jacobian. That might best show the impact of this term.

Availability,"Thanks, with these build commands, I can reproduce the ""`2.0 == 0.7`"" unit test error in an MPICH environment, when running the test with a single MPI process (`mpirun.mpich -np 1`). For multiple MPI processes, the test passes in my current setup. The error persists when I disable OpenMP. When I use OpenMPI instead of MPICH, the test driver crashes for `-np 1` (""An error occurred in MPI_Win_create ... MPI_ERR_WIN: invalid window"") but probably that is a different issue. After some std::cout debugging, I suspect that the MPICH implementation of [`MPI_Allgatherv`](https://www.mpich.org/static/docs/v3.2/www3/MPI_Allgatherv.html) is not working as expected in the case of a single MPI process. . I would expect that if there is only a single MPI process, `MPI_Allgatherv` copies `sendcount*sizeof(scalartype)`=`recvcounts[0]*sizeof(scalartype)` bytes from `(scalartype*)sendbuf` to `(scalartype*)recvbuf+displs[0]`, where `scalartype` is the C type represented by the MPI types `sendtype`=`recvtype`. This is the behaviour I had in mind when writing the NdFlattener code. With [minimal.cpp.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/10459977/minimal.cpp.txt) (remove the .txt), OpenMPI gives the following results:; ```bash; $ mpic++ minimal.cpp -o minimal ; $ mpirun -np 1 ./minimal; Rank 0 recvbuf = -42 100 ; $ mpirun -np 2 ./minimal; Rank 0 recvbuf = -42 100 101 ; Rank 1 recvbuf = -42 100 101 ; ```; This is in line with the expected behaviour of `MPI_Allgatherv` described above. For MPICH however, I get:; ```bash; $ mpicxx.mpich minimal.cpp -o minimal; $ mpirun.mpich -np 1 ./minimal; Rank 0 recvbuf = 100 0 ; $ mpirun.mpich -np 2 ./minimal; Rank 0 recvbuf = -42 100 101 ; Rank 1 recvbuf = -42 100 101 ; ```; as if `displs` were ignored for `-np 1`. @pcarruscag Can you confirm this observation?

Availability,"That's not consistent with any code I know, when using the MRF approach you either get frozen rotor or mixing plane interfaces. If you want a more accurate simulation you move the mesh and update the interfaces, there are several advantages to not dealing with the MRF source terms. There are also practical aspects of not updating the interface when doing transient MRF, for example it lets you handle interfaces that are not cylindrical, people use this to model car wheels.; MRF is also less restrictive for time step size than moving mesh, but if you move the interface you bring some of the moving mesh restrictions to MRF.

Availability,"The adjoint handling of the Eigen library can actually be a two step process. In the first step we just use the BlackBox differentiation of Eigen. This will work for every user in the primal code and adjoint code. As a second step we would then look into the BLAS wrapper of Eigen and check if we can provide a special treatment for the adjoint aka CoDiPack version. In general there are two options available:. 1. Wrap the BLAS calls in external functions, requires a lot of manual programming but can be generalized so that it is also available as a general feature of CoDiPack (e.g. We can handle BLAS to XX %). 2. Make use of the ""new"" AD tool I am currently programming. This tool does not insert itself into the Eigen structures, but wraps around them. Then the special path for BLAS can be activated without the AD tool even noticing it.

Availability,"The flow rate output for axisymmetric cases from SetAnalyzeSurface(...) is wrong due to the ""else"" on line 196 in CFlowOutput.cpp. When y[i] = 0 (the node lies on the axis) AxiFactor is just set to 1.0 instead of y[i] * 2 * pi (y-coordinate of the vertex of the primal grid) which may cause a significant error. For me I fixed it simply by setting "" else AxiFactor = 0.5 * y[i-1] * 2 * pi "" as the loop always ends on the axis. This works for my inlet and outlet (left to right) but this will fail if the loop starts at y=0 instead of ending there. Perhaps that could happen in a right to left domain. . There is certainly a safer more general way I imagine by accessing the y-coordinate of the vertex of the dual grid .

Availability,"There is an issue for time accurate simulations with multi-stage time integration schemes in combination with multiple (fluid) zones. The reason is that the loop over the multiple (usually Runge-Kutta) stages takes place in the function CMultiGridIntegration::MultiGrid_Cycle, while the loop over the zones is carried out in the drivers. Hence the loop over the (Runge-Kutta) stages takes place inside the loop over the multiple zones. This is fundamentally wrong and will lead to at most 1st order accuracy in time. Hence, the sequence of these loops should be reversed. In principle there are two ways to do this, namely moving the loop over the Runge-Kutta stages up in the hierarchy, or moving the loop over the zones down. I think the former option is undesirable, because this means that all the details of the different time integration schemes must be moved to the driver, which does not improve readability (to say the least). Furthermore, it leads to serious problems when more advanced time integration schemes (with time accurate local time stepping) are employed. So therefore, in my opinion, the only practical solution is to move the loop over the zones downwards in the hierarchy. This leads to significant changes in the implementation, but does this lead to a fundamental problem for any of the applications of SU2?. Thanks,.

Availability,"There is sth weird going on with the added inlet regression test.

Maybe I also did a mistake when porting the CSpeciesSolver to that new structure. I am trying to do a verification of the inlet files by using the written example_inlet_file as input which should result in the very same history as the non-inlet version. I see a difference in Residuals which is sometimes not consistent (I had cases where I cycled through 3 different outcomes for the inlet version in a random order...wtf). It has nothing to do with the wrong values being read in and made available to the Solver, they are perfect. I now did 2 full-time days of debugging and I a don't get it.

Availability,"There seems to potentially be a bug with doing an unsteady dual-timestepping simulation without a provided initial condition (restart file):. When no restart file is provided, the first inner iterations have Time_Iter=0 and Cur_Time=0 (the state **before** these inner iterations). After completion of this time iteration, a file `flow_00000.vtu` and all others are outputted. These files are _not_ the initial condition as specified by the configuration file -- they seem to actually be the solution after the first time step. This can be reproduced easily in the config file I have attached to this issue (an updated version of TestCases/plunging_naca0012 for SU2 v8). The `flow_00000.vtu` file has non-uniform flowfields, which doesn't make sense. For simulations where a restart file like `restart_00000.dat` is provided, the Time_Iter=1 and Cur_Time=dt (the state **after** these inner iterations), and the subsequently outputted files have the correct time iteration appended to it. I think that for non-restart unsteady simulations, the IC should be outputted as solely just the initialization before any inner iterations are completed, Time_Iter++ and Cur_Time+=dt, and THEN inner iterations performed.

Availability,"This PR is a major upgrade to the existing density-based incompressible solver (Euler, N-S, and RANS). The solver is now outfitted with a custom preconditioning that can handle a range of incompressible problems, including isothermal, decoupled energy, Boussinesq, and variable density flows (low Mach N-S). The solver uses a conservative formulation and is primitive variable-based. Features:; * Energy equation has been integrated into the incompressible solver. Can be disabled, run in decoupled mode, or coupled for variable density.; * Customized upwind and centered convective schemes in space and time integration schemes that account for preconditioning.; * 2 new fluid models: constant density fluid, incompressible ideal gas (variable density as a function of temperature). Temperature dependent transport coefficients.; * New non-dim. and initialization that mirrors the compressible solver.; * New set of configuration file options specific for incompressible problems (see config_template.cfg).; * Boussinesq approximation for problems with small temperature differences (e.g., natural convection).; * Axisymmetric mode updated, including viscous terms. Some notes:; * Discrete adjoint is available for new solver, but continuous incompressible adjoint has been removed for now. ; * Method of handling non-constant thermal conductivity in transport model (constant Prandtl w/ RANS) could be reused with compressible code.; * Heat flux reference value for non-dim. is missing from compressible code.; * I will do some clean up after this PR to remove some old “incompressible” flags and code that are no longer needed (output and source terms, especially).; * I have many V&V cases for this solver that I will be adding as additional regressions and tutorials.; * Some effort now needed to sync the CHT work. @oleburghardt @talbring , let's chat about this.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/514:1202,avail,available,1202,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/514,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"This Pull Request is the long-awaited overhaul of the front-end partitioning routines for the finite volume solver. It is both a complete refactoring and a streamlining of the routines to remove several bottlenecks (memory and superfluous MPI calls) that were limiting the performance at high rank counts.

For now, the old geometry routines are used for processing meshes with periodic BCs. Once the periodic BCs are all updated, we will remove the old CPhysicalGeometry constructor and associated routines in order to clean up. **Note that this PR affects everyone using the finite volume solver.** The regressions are going to fail :).

Availability,"This is a very important topic, @jayantmukho. The optimization functionality is very difficult for folks to get working on their own. There are too many options, and it is not user friendly. We need to improve, and I am open to streamlining the interface if you have some ideas. In general, the bevy of options that you nicely describe above have been added over the years in order to coax the scipy SLSQP optimizer into converging, especially with constraints. It has mostly been a trial-and-error process during that time. Most of the tricks involve getting the scaling set such that the SLSQP optimizer does not take any massively errant steps during its line search that cause divergence. I think it would be great to see a standard normalization of the problem (say, make everything on the order of 1 going in/out of the optimizer) and interfaces to new optimizers (this exists already in part in feature_pyopt). In practice, I use **ONLY** the Scale value in OPT_OBJECTIVE and OPT_CONSTRAINT (set to a value that results in a first optimizer step roughly 10% the characteristic length of my geometry), and ignore the options OPT_GRADIENT_FACTOR, OPT_RELAX_FACTOR, and OPT_LINE_SEARCH_BOUND.

Availability,This is now completely general I believe. `geometry->node[iPoint]->GetPoint(index)` always returns the right point either for index 0 or 1 at least in a quad mesh (there are only two neighbours at the corner) and the wrong one equals the normal neighbour. I tried it on a triangular mesh and it worked as well but perhaps it won't always be correct. The worst case is an error equal to the one of setting it to 0.0 and it's just as safe. Setting it to 0.0 is what I did at first but the axis is not a wall in general so it's usually the point with the largest cells and the highest velocities unless it's an Euler case. If there are very few nodes overall on the marker the contribution may not be that small.

Availability,"This pull request enlarges the capability of SU2 to simulate internal flows in turbomachinery. The flow solver is now capable of performing 3D steady multi-zone simulations via a 3D Non-Reflecting Mixing Plane. The implementation is based on the work done by Saxer and Giles (available at https://doi.org/10.2514/3.23618). To adapt the implementation of Saxer and Giles to an unstructured vertex-based solver such as SU2, a new data structure, called **_CTurboVertex_**, was created for the inflow and outflow boundaries. The **_CTurboVertex_** class is a child of the class **_CVertex_**; thus, it maintains all the standard vertex properties. However, more than a standard vertex, the turboVertex posses:. 1. the possibility of accessing the inflow and outflow boundaries on a span-wise manner (to impose different values of the mixing-plane condition along the blade-height) and on a pitch-wise ordered manner (to compute the Spatial Fourier Transformation of the outgoing characteristics at the boundary for the non-reflectivity). 2. embedded information on what kind of turbomachinery architecture is being simulated, so that the values of velocity at the boundaries can be imposed using the correct frame of reference. So in a nutshell the flow solver is now capable of:. - simulating single 2D/3D turbomachinery blades using 1D characteristic-based BC or Non reflecting BC; - simulating multi-stage 2D/3D turbomachinery via a Mixing-Plane interface, including also the mixing of the turbulent quantities; - handling any kind of turbomachinery architecture (AXIAL, CENTRIFUGAL, CENTRIPETAL and mixed such as CENTRIPETAL_AXIAL or AXIAL_CENTRIFUGAL); - selecting 2 different kind of interpolation methods for the mixing-plane interface: LINEAR_INTERPOLATION and NEAREST_NEIGHBOR; - handling an unlimited number of blades/stages —> (zones); - simulating turbomachinery which works on the NICFD regime such as supercritical CO2 compressors or Organic Rankine Cycle turbines.; - printing history_x.da",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/413:276,avail,available,276,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/413,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"This pull requests adds a capability for multi-objective adjoint evaluation. ; In order to use this capability, a matching number of objectives and surface markers on which to evaluate those objectives, as well as weighting values for each objective must be set. This also works with the python optimization tools, where a flag (COMBINE_OBJECTIVE) determines whether the gradients will be evaluated with a single combined adjoint evaluation or with separate, sequential evaluations. . Option Syntax:; For use with shape_optimization.py:; OPT_OBJECTIVE = DRAG*1.0; LIFT*2.0 ; COMBINE_OBJECTIVE = YES; For use with continuous_adjoint, SU2_CFD, etc, or automatically set by the shape_optimization script:; OBJECTIVE = DRAG, LIFT; OBJECTIVE_WEIGHT = 1.0, -2.0; (Note: opt_objective is still effected by automatically-applied signs - that is, whatever scale is applied to lift will be *-1 to make it a maximization problem. User can now reverse that sign if desired.); In either case, MARKER_MONITORING =( drag_surface, lift_surface); If only one surface is specified, it will automatically be the surface for all objectives listed. Different objectives on different surfaces can also be applied, using lists of the same length. . This change required moving some scaling terms - which means that in one of the test cases the values changed because a scaling factor is moved within the boundary conditions rather than applied after the fact (the final gradient result is the same). In addition to allowing the adjoint for a weighted sum of objectives, this may theoretically allow for applying a numerically convenient scaling factor in the future - ie, in cases where the boundary terms are either too large or too small and cause numerical cancellation errors. .

Availability,"Tom,. Ok. So 3 Gb and 4 sec to write on 72 cores is about 10.6Mb / sec / core. Since not each core has access to a separate I/O node (assume 8 cores / processor), that would give upwards of 80 Mb / sec / node which is quite respectable. The reading seems a bit slower, but it is indeed a major improvement. Later in time we should do some tests for much larger files to make sure we get some level of scalability. Best,. Juan.

Availability,"We have used SU2 and SU2-NEMO to predict the heat flux for various shapes in a high-speed flow. Something we have observed is that SU2 requires an extremely small first cell spacing to get an accurate and grid-independent prediction for heat flux. For example, this first cell space is often 1E-9 to 1E-10 m with SU2; whereas with other codes it is a micrometer. The latter is in line with the general rule of thumb of setting the first cell height so that the first cell Reynold's number is between 0.1 and 1.0. Discussing with @jtneedels and @WallyMaier, we think it may have to do with how the temperature gradient is calculated in CNSSolver.cpp:. /*--- Compute the normal gradient in temperature using Twall ---*/. ` su2double dTdn = -(There - Twall)/dist_ij;`. /*--- Apply a weak boundary condition for the energy equation.; Compute the residual due to the prescribed heat flux. ---*/. ` su2double Res_Conv = 0.0;; su2double Res_Visc = thermal_conductivity * dTdn * Area;`. which may result in a first-order approximation for the temperature gradient causing this requirement for an extremely small cell size to recover the true gradient. I would be interested to see if calculating this gradient similar to CFVMFlowSolverBase.ini.

Availability,"While doing some simulations with the version 6.2.0, I found a strange behaviour on the pressure field.; The test case is a naca0012 at AoA=0°, M=0.7, Re=9e6.; When running with SST turbulence model, the pressure field in the ""boundary layer region"" is not constant. Using SA turbulence model, this behaviour is not shown. It looks like the tubulent kinetic energy field affect the computation of pressure field, leading to a non zero gradient pressure at wall, as shown in the attached figures:. In the figures it can be seen a comparison between the in-house solver of the Italian Aerospace Research Center (CIRA), where SST model is implemented, and SU2 using both available turbulence models, SST and SA. The isolines represent the pressure field and the contour is the TKE field obtained with SU2 with SST. In particular, solid red line is CIRA solver, the solid black line is SU2-SST, and dashed black line is SU2-SA. Near the LE where TKE is 0, the isolines are similar and 0 pressure gradient at the wall is obtained with both turbulence models. When TKE starts to grow, the pressure computed with SU2-SST shows a non constant behaviour and at the wall has non 0 gradient. Furthermore, in the wake region the defect is more evident.

Availability,"Wonderful contribution. Thanks for doing all that. Streamlining the dev process is very helpful and cmake is definitely becoming a standard. Best,. Juan. On Nov 10, 2019, at 11:24 AM, Daumantas Kavolis <notifications@github.com> wrote:. ﻿; Proposed Changes. Added CMake build support for SU2. With this, many popular IDEs will be able to use SU2 as a project with minimal setup. CMake also enables to add dependencies more easily since most libraries have CMake support. vcpkg is great for the libraries available there. SU2 CMake has the same build options as autotools but uses CMake to find system libraries and compilers (MKL, Mutationpp, MPI and Python currently). No longer need to specify paths to compilers/libraries if they are in standard locations. In addition, compile flags can be modified from CMake. There is no need to use preconfigure.py anymore since downloading/unpacking is handled by CMake and is system-agnostic. At the moment, all library targets are static but that could be easily changed to be configurable from CMake. The installation directory is ${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}/bin. Similarly to autotools, some build options are disabled if built with Codi forward/reverse datatypes or without MPI. Note that SWIG fails to compile pySU2ad with Nothing known about namespace 'medi' in Common/include/mpi_structure.hpp:57 without -includeall SWIG option but then it takes forever to generate the wrapper (more than 15 minutes on my machine, stopped early). I suggest removing using namespace declarations and either importing used symbols explicitly with using or prepending namespace name, clang-tidy warns against them by default and it makes the code clearer. SU2 CMake options are:. * Build modules:; * SU2_BUILD_CFD: ON|OFF; * SU2_BUILD_DEF: ON|OFF, disabled when building with Codi; * SU2_BUILD_DOT: ON|OFF, disabled when building with Codi forward; * SU2_BUILD_GEO: ON|OFF, disabled when building with Codi; * SU2_BUILD_MSH: ON|OFF, disabled when building with Codi; * SU2_BUIL",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814#issuecomment-552242380:504,avail,available,504,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814#issuecomment-552242380,4,"['avail', 'down']","['available', 'downloading']"

Availability,"Yeah the config is a bit confusing. The initial CFD run (in adap/ini) uses the value specified in ITER (unless RESTART_SOL= YES, then it runs one iteration just to get force coefficients). . After that, it runs a series of adaptations based on the settings in PYADAP_SUBITE, PYADAP_FLOW_ITER, and PYADAP_COMPLEXITY. . 1. AMG interpolates the solution; 2. A simulation is run for PYADAP_FLOW_ITER[0] iterations (2999 in your case); 3. An adaptation is performed with a target size of PYADAP_COMPLEXITY[0] (20000 in your case). This is done PYADAP_SUBITE[0] times. Then it moves on to the next mesh level. I admit that I haven't really debugged the feature-based (e.g. Mach-based) adaptation much. I found a couple bugs in the python scripts and just updated them, so could you pull again and rerun ninja?. The AMG output is pretty long, but since it's developed at Inria, I don't have any control over that. I guess as long as none of the lines are error statements (usually complaining about invalid projections or negative eigenvalues of the metric from my experience) it should be fine. The only actual information I get from amg.log is usually in the last line; ```; NbSensor 30518 msh->npobk 30518 NbrTyp 19 msh->npoin 52477; ```; which just tells you how many points are in the old vs. new mesh, but you could just look at the .su2 files for that.

The Default is `CUpwRoe_Flow` (`ROE`) and I added `CCentJST_Flow_BC` which is the normal `JST` without dissipation. ; The third option `MUSCL_ADJFLOW` has to be left on NO, this is work in progress :) . With the options given above you will use the new Euler wall implementation but using JST without dissipation term as a convective scheme for boundary nodes. This (as I say in point 2. in my above post) basically recovers the old euler wall implementation. . For the OneraM6 case the combination of new Euler + JST_BC recovers the CD & CL results of the old code. Can you also try running `CONV_NUM_METHOD_FLOW= ROE` with the code you labelled as 'SU2 FSI new (new bound condition)' and 'SU2 FSI new (oldbound condition)'. Because by doing so you switch the numerical method in the volume and to the same ROE scheme on the boundary -> just as the current default in the develop. So my current assumption is that it is a matter of convective scheme (on the boundary). ~~I'll try to attach my cases as a zip and two images here.~~; Here the green line represents the current develop if one uses MARKER_EULER or MARKER_SYM. Another info here is: by using the oldEuler wall (i.e. line 1&2) the choice of convective scheme on the boundary is irrelevant for the Euler_wall as the old implementation ""skips"" that step.

Availability,"[ issue title should say ""Python modules install to /usr/bin"" - it's not just FSI_tools ]. Building v7.5.1 on Linux (Slackware 15.0) installs three subdirectories to /usr/bin:. /usr/bin/FSI_tools/; /usr/bin/SU2/; /usr/bin/SU2_Nastran/. These appear to be Python modules. Is this install location intended? Perhaps I missed an important build step. The difficulty is that this conflicts with the Linux filesystem hierarchy: ""4.4.2: There must be no subdirectories in /usr/bin."". https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch04s04.html. ... and results in complaints when building e.g. a Slackbuild package. In any event, /usr/bin is not where Python modules belong. Minor problem, I know, but the fix is probably pretty easy: Install these modules using pip. I believe pip is supposed to know the correct place to install modules. For example, on my system, pip installs them to /usr/lib64/python<version>/site-packages, which seems to be on the default module search path. Side benefit: one can dispense with setting SU2_RUN and PYTHONPATH in ~/.bashrc. And PATH in any event, since /usr/bin should already be in the path except in rare cases.

Hello @pcarruscag!. To be honest, my daydream is: I would love to see SU2 shipping nothing in 'externals/' (or just empty subdirectories such as 'externals/meson/' ); then those external dependencies are by default downloaded from external repositories or tar archives. This defaul behavior would be obtained by configuring with the './meson.py' script and then by building with './ninja'. But, if a user wants to build SU2 from source and prefers to use system-wide Meson and Ninja and system-wide versions of the external dependencies, it would be possible to avoid downloading these external dependencies. By running './preconfigure.py' with appropriate options, it would be possible to decide which external dependencies to **not** download. At that point, system-wide Meson and Ninja could be used to build SU2 from source. And the 'meson.build' file would do the following:. * for each required or enabled (at configure time) dependency **\<foo\>**, it would check whether it is found in 'externals/**\<foo\>**/'; if not, it would check whether it can be found as a system-wide installation (perhaps via pkgconfig); if not, it would exit with error; * for each dependency which is not required nor enabled at configure time, it would avoid using it at all.

Availability,"[sd2_case1b_ddes_v7.cfg.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/4531160/sd2_case1b_ddes_v7.cfg.txt). Hello,. We are currently unable to restart SU2 in DDES mode from a restart file that includes time-averaged data on very large (~180 million cell) meshes. Compiled in release mode, the code gives the error ""FGMRES orthogonalization failed, linear solver diverged."". Compiled in debug mode, the code issues an assertion failure at line 1881 of $SU2_HOME/SU2_CFD/src/numerics_structure.cpp, which is a check in the CNumerics::SetRoe_Dissipation(...) method to make sure that variable 'Dissipation_j' is between zero and one. This problem only appears when attempting to restart from solution files that include ""TIME_AVERAGE"" data on very large meshes. Note the above behavior is occurring with commit 382e82f5e43fadb5d64e63289db8e125e37ffe95 of the ""develop"" branch. . I have pulled the latest commits of develop (c093a62a2b) and master (d9c867d342), but get segfaults during Jacobian structure initialization when attempting to restart on multiple cores.

Availability,"_):. - **FGMRES** solved by initial guess.; - **CONJUGATE_GRADIENT** reached the convergency conditions but being MAX DIFF. = 0 no deformation was applied to the mesh. Similarly, SU2_DOT_AD behaved in the same manner even if adjoint solution was tightly converged. To exclude any non-dependency from the objective function, different options were investigated (DRAG, LIFT, SURFACE_MACH, SURFACE_TOTAL_PRESSURE, ENTROPY_GENERATION) and nothing changed. Moreover, the vaned diffuser scenario (_not visualized in here for simplicity_) seems to be affected too, even if very similar to basic flow scenarios (_basically, it is just an internal 3D-flow over airfoil case_). I thought this behavior could be traced to a bug since my previous mesh deformation always proceeded smoothly (_from flow past cylinder to other internal flow scenarios_), either with arbitrary or gradient based deformation. However, none of these were investigated with turbomachinery settings, which are necessary for this scenario for two main reasons:. 1. post processing parameters computed by SU2; 6. this mesh is part of a turbomachinery multi-block simulation. **To reproduce**; [config.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/11416238/config.txt) -> cfg file; [mesh_out.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/11416239/mesh_out.txt) -> mesh (_FFD box attached_).

However, in the FEM/DG solver, the `base_nodes` is defaulted to `nullptr` and we have workarounds in the FEM/DG sovler that does not require a call to `GetNodes()` in other parts of the code (we use elements instead of nodes, so the concept of nodes is not really well-defined in the FEM/DG solver). . At the moment, the develop branch will fail at this line if anyone attempts to use the FEM/DG solver. . E.g., Taking the `hom_euler/NACA0012_5thOrder` test case in the repo gives the following error message:; ```SU2_CFD: ../SU2_CFD/src/output/../../include/solvers/CSolver.hpp:230: const CVariable* CSolver::GetNodes() const: Assertion `base_nodes!=nullptr && ""CSolver::base_nodes was not set properly, see brief for CSolver::SetBaseClassPointerToNodes()""' failed.``` at the pre-processing stage before any computation is done. Hence, a conditional operator is added to avoid this call for DG solvers. ## Related Work; *Resolve any issues (bug fix or feature request), note any related PRs, or mention interactions with the work of others, if any.*; @vdweide and I are working on a new version of the DG solver that needs this workaround anyway.

This is less automatic than wrapping it in meson.py, but does provide pretty clear directions... the sticking point is if people download tarballs.

In this case, I first downloaded the 'develop' branch to make sure everything is consitent with Pedro, and then I downloaded and replaced the 6 new committed files that related to the supersonic inlet profile development. The code should be totally the same at this point. And I did a flat plate test, which actually I need to fill a uniform profile, since the code would only generated an empty one. However, a segment error still occurs, and I attached the error file with Valgrind output. After eliminating the difference of different branches(versions), I guess you may have the same error?

Refactor SU2_GEO such that all its functionality can be performed in python (in progress); 2. Add a generalized thickness constraint (in progress); 3. Be able to do multiple types of geometry evaluation (for example wing+fuselage); 4. Expose some of the mesh deformation functions to python to allow for robust design variable definition; 5. Perform all of the shape optimization using the in-memory python scripts; 6. Intelligent handling of solution divergences that doesn't break the optimization; 7. Better way to define multipoint optimizations; 8. Better multi-objective optimization definition (#913 might be helpful in this); 9. Simplify the multitude of shape optimization options (#733). As you can probably tell, a lot of my examples and motivations revolve around aerospace applications. So while I try and make a general framework that is robust, I might not be thinking in a broad enough fashion. I would love to get input from the community for any functionality that they might want to see in this framework. The more robust this is, the more widely useful it will be. I am also a newbie to the python wrapper world of SU2.

Availability,"aybe you refer to the develop code at the time where these tags were introduced. But maybe sth different. > I guess they converge eventually to the same values. I tried to compare the same case but steady (I attach the summary). Results in this case are fairly similar and (in my opinion) raise no warnings. That is good to hear. ; Luckily @cvencro (Thanks for that 👍 ) ran some tests and found that #740 (which rewrites Euler Wall boundaries for compressible and incompressible flows ... which was me btw) introduces the changes you see. The Euler wall for compressible is changed a bit in the way the boundary condition is enforced. Upon convergence both version should recover (close to) the same value. If the results in a steady state are the same/very-similar and if an unsteady simulation at low enough Reynolds-number converges to the same steady result (or oscillate in the same bounds) -> I would say it is simply some purely numerical effect based on the unphysical initialization and different treatment of the euler wall boundary. . 1 thing one could test additionally is to force a very high convergence in each physical timestep, i.e. usually one converges ~3 orders of magnitude in each ts -> now try converging until residual stalling in each ts. If the code versions get the same/closer results in the temporal evolution my euler wall boundary explanation would be quite reasonable.; Together with the long running unsteady simulation proposed above, I would feel more comfortable to judge. @cvencro (bringing the conversation to this place 😉 ) concerning the pitching case: the `if (dynamic_grid)` statements in the 'old' version are not necessary as that is handled by the numerics class.

Availability,"ch request to make it clearer. Request: Use nomenclature consistent with the C++ interface (point instead of node, etc.); Reason: People who know the C++ interface will know how to use the python wrapper straight away, people who learn how to use the python wrapper will be able to understand the C++ implementation (without needing a translation layer in their mind all the time). Request: Return connectivity/adjacency as local indices instead of global; Reason: This is the natural way of referencing data in an MPI code, local indices correspond directly to data stored in the partition thereby making it more efficient to access (without global-to-local conversions, which are much more expensive than local-to-global). Furthermore, the local ordering strategy improves the efficiency of loops (over edges, neighboring points, etc.). Request: Do not apply unnecessary ""transformations"" to the connectivity/adjacency as part of the API; Reason: Increases the maintenance burden and makes for a less versatile API. By returning the local indices that form a marker or element, it is trivial to retrieve any other data for those indices (the ""transformation""). For example, the solution at those points, the point coordinates, whether the points are halo or domain points, the global indices, etc.; This way, by adding a **single** function to the API e.g. get the global index of a point of element, the functionality of the API grows a lot more because the user can apply the function to **any** connectivity/adjacency function. Request: Do not offer too many overloads of the same function; Reason: Increases the maintenance burden and it's returning the data in structures that are not very efficient, namely vector of vectors. It is much easier to offer domain-wide data access on the python side, as a very small function that can be part of wrapper utilities (i.e. live only in python but not c++). It may even be more efficient since you make a numpy array/matrix instead of lists of lists.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1300#issuecomment-1402197827:1643,mainten,maintenance,1643,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1300#issuecomment-1402197827,2,['mainten'],['maintenance']

Availability,"d JST scheme (these are the two options I have tested). It is possible to resolve this error by simply moving the stopping of the preaccumulation region from before the call to `updateLinearSystem` in the `ComputeFlux` method of both these schemes, to after, as show below. `/*--- Update the vector and system matrix. ---*/. updateLinearSystem(iEdge, iPoint, jPoint, implicit, updateType,; updateMask, flux, jac_i, jac_j, vector, matrix);. /*--- Stop preaccumulation. ---*/. stopPreacc(flux);`. However, whilst this resolve the error in this location, the next error appears in the Giles boundary condition. Here the two jacobian components within the residual object are not recorded correctly in the preaccumulation output region also. This in `CEulerSolver.cpp:6556`. `/*--- Compute the residual using an upwind scheme ---*/; auto residual = conv_numerics->ComputeResidual(config);. /*--- Update residual value ---*/; LinSysRes.AddBlock(iPoint, residual);`. I have tried simpy adding these components as preacc outputs however they are SIMD arrays and the datatype cannot be converted using the existing implementation. . I am not sure what is going on here, or the next steps to resolve this problem.

Availability,"d compressible) viscous fluxes are considered in the symmetry plane boundary condition. In both codes the BC_sym_plane links directly to Euler_Wall. . Compressible: A ""reflected state"" approach is done. Create a reflected halo node which enforces symmetry and compute the occurring flux just as in the interior. Problem: the primitive gradients are not adapted nor a viscous flux based on that is computed. Incompressible: Here a ""direct flux"" approach is chosen in Euler Wall. Insert the symmetry conditions directly in the FV derivation on the boundary part and thereby eliminate most terms. For the convective terms only a pressure contribution in the momentum equation remains. No Viscous terms are currently considered which is not correct for the momentum equation. . For both solvers I implemented a ""reflected state"" approach in C*Solver::BC_sym_plane as I didn't want to touch the Euler_wall implementations especially from the compressible solver. . I (informally) wrote a bit down as explanation in Latex how I did the derivation.; [Symmetry_BC.pdf](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/2891210/Symmetry_BC.pdf); Note that in the DG-FEM solver of @vdweide the same ""reflected state"" approach is implemented although it is not clear to me how the derivation was done there. See the bottom of the pdf for more info. I would be happy to get some insight here :).

Availability,"dient method (unweighted least squares recommended), which is very important for robustness. Gradients for viscous terms and sources are still computed via GG or WLS for accuracy reasons.; - SA model was being clipped unnecessarily. This clipping has been removed. Here is my recommendation on how to run all of your 2nd-order cases going forward:. ### Euler / Laminar N-S; Turn off the limiters, unless you truly need them for preserving solution monotonicity (e.g., for shocks/discontinuities). Use ; ```; NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON= LEAST_SQUARES; ```; for robustness. Start with a CFL around 10 and converge the implicit system with LINEAR_SOLVER_ITER= 10 for each nonlinear iteration (FGMRES + ILU0 recommended). Activate the CFL adaption with. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down, factor up, CFL min value,; % CFL max value ); CFL_ADAPT= YES; CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.1, 2.0, 10.0, 1e10); ```. It is important that the linear solve behaves well for each nonlinear iteration, so if this does not converge immediately, adjust the tolerance or number of linear iterations. Roe seems very stable, but some of the other upwind schemes or centered schemes may require improved Jacobian accuracy (to recover fast convergence) with:. ```; USE_ACCURATE_FLUX_JACOBIANS= YES; CENTRAL_JACOBIAN_FIX_FACTOR= 4.0; ```. ### RANS; Due to the segregated approach for the turbulence models, you have to be more conservative with the CFL adaption. All else is the same as above, but I recommend. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down, factor up, CFL min value,; % CFL max value ); CFL_ADAPT= YES; CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.1, 1.2, 10.0, 1e3); ```. Most inviscid/laminar cases that I have tested so far converge to machine precision within a couple of hundred iterations. RANS cases within a few thousand. Ultra fine RANS meshes can still slow things down (MG could help there), but otherwise, speedups of an order of magnitude (or more) are possible for most problems.

Availability,"e the following self explanatory marker names:; - ""propellerUpperSurface""; - ""propellerLowerSurface""; - ""propellerRightTip""; - ""propellerLeftTip"". Many combinations of the possible boundary conditions setup were tested for the ""inlet"", ""farfield"" and ""outlet"" markers. Furthermore the Inlet BC were tried with many different vertical speeds (vx=0/0.001/0.01/0.1/1/10). Simulations with the inlet, farfield and outlet as TOTAL_INLET, FARFIELD, OUTLET and EULER and some (not all) combination between these BC were tried. The mesh was generated with Salome-Meca. It is a tetrahedral mesh. I have a script that permits to change the domain size with ease. So from the mesh perspective it is fairly easy to test different mesh sizes and domain sizes.; Generally the outer domain radius was between 1.5*propRadius to 10*propRadus. Domain height between 3*propRadius to 15*propRadius. The prop was at 2/3 of the total height (1/2 and 3/4 were also tested). Some simulations approximated from a far experimental results (thrust +/-10% error, torque +/-15%). Some completely diverged some converge towards something way out of the 10% error range. **To Reproduce**.

Availability,"econditioner, and matrix-vector product) have a single template parameter, the data type (which can be passivedouble or su2double). There are no provisions for ""mixed"" arithmetic, except in CSysSolve where through ::Solve (and only through ::Solve) one can ask for the solution of a system with passive Jacobian and active RHS and solution (this is possible at the expense of temporaries that are allocated only once). Passive-Passive and Active-Active work without temporaries and Active-Passive is not supported as it does not make sense (see end of previous paragraph). This is to keep the need for template specialization to a minimum. Wherever mixing types was necessary small helper methods were defined to provide the compatibility instead of specializing larger methods, I think this keeps the code readable. The place where passive and active types mix the most is CSysMatrix. This happens because the blocks are prepared by the numerics in **su2double and are then ""Set"", ""Add"", or ""Subtract"", on a CSysMatrix<passivedouble>. The solution was to inline those routines and template them also for the data type of the block (or diagonal). I only tested on one fluid adjoint and one FSI adjoint case (fingers cross not to fail too many tests). ## Related Work; #594 Does not help with memory much but helps with speed.; #648 Makes it easier to interface with an external solver and still work with the discrete adjoint.; #650 Builds on top of what is proposed there.; #543 These MKL optimizations will now be possible for the discrete adjoint but I have not made them available yet.; Branch *feature_template_linear_solver*. ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [X] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/653:2052,avail,available,2052,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/653,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"ed the linear solvers stay the same and routines that are light see more speedup than their arithmetic-intensive friends.; What is surprising to me is how intensive the convective residuals appear to be with only a 7% improvement, so surprising in fact, I do not think the above paints the full picture. Maybe the outlet bandwidth bottleneck (into the Jacobian matrix) is more important.; To put that do the test I switched to Euler-explicit time marching and repeated the measurements:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38071223/63293351-d8010b80-c2bf-11e9-8135-2502eac1128e.png); Better, but not by much, which means upwind and viscous residuals computations might gain a lot from vectorization (SIMD). And like @economon mentioned even more if they are somehow fused together.; It also means the writes to CSysMatrix are relatively expensive, I think there are two-three reasons for it.; - We do a linear search on each Add/SubtractBlock - This could be replaced by a map.; - The Jacobian contributions are first written into a temporary block - Interleaving the writes with the computation could help mask latency.; - That temporary is not stored contiguously - Which makes it hard to vectorize the writes to CSysMatrix. **So what do I think should be tackled next?**; Hybrid parallelism (wait what?!) from messing about with this case (and more refined versions) it is clear the MG puts some limits on how many cores can be used before it stops being able to produce coarse grids, both in number and quality. Going to an MPI+Threads strategy would move that limit by one order of magnitude, giving us some robustness and performance for folks hoping to rely on strong scaling. I think I'll break it off here and keep my thoughts about SIMD and hybrid parallel for a later occasion (I have to do some ""real"" PhD work for a while) but please, if anyone has ideias, comments, corrections, suggestions, similar ongoing developments (specially)... I am all ears/eyes.

Availability,"egin to run much larger models. Otherwise the preprocessing time for the searches can become excessive and dominant. If someone wanted to try using PCL for this, that would be quite interesting. Given the open source license, as Tom mentions, there should not be a problem interfacing with SU2. Now, an issue we faced in the ASC / PSAAP programs is that for extremely large calculations, the surface mesh (to be searched for minimum distance calculations) may actually not fit in a single processor. For that purpose we built parallel ADTs in the past (unfortunately in FORTRAN90) which replicate a small portion of the upper structure of the tree in all processors (without consuming a lot of memory) and then decomposed the tree into the various processors participating in the searches. While the parallel speedups / efficiencies were not earth-shattering, we did manage to overcome the memory bottlenecks. Does anyone know if PCL can also handle trees that are decomposed in parallel? Would PCL work with its own MPI communicator and automate the communication needed for the searches?. Cheers,. Juan. On Jun 5, 2016, at 4:06 AM, Thomas D. Economon <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>> wrote:. Indeed, at the moment, we are relying on brute force searches. We have discussed using tree searches internally (and potentially have some reusable code available for this), but nothing has been implemented. It looks like pointcloud is released under a BSD license, which is very permissive. Do you have an implementation in SU2 already with this code embedded? It is also fairly straightforward for us to add hooks in the configure process to installed libraries on your system. —; You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.; Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/282#issuecomment-223807001, or mute the threadhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe/ADpSxPh8ni-GpSN-zKjD9Nyi47sf5sqZks5qIq2jgaJpZM4ItVbi.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/282#issuecomment-223861540:1604,avail,available,1604,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/282#issuecomment-223861540,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"entation) using `VISUALIZE_SURFACE_DEF` as a hooked boolean. ; With `VISUALIZE_VOLUME_DEF` one can change which convective scheme is used on the boundary, i.e. what is in the numerics container `CONV_BOUND_TERM`. The Default is `CUpwRoe_Flow` (`ROE`) and I added `CCentJST_Flow_BC` which is the normal `JST` without dissipation. ; The third option `MUSCL_ADJFLOW` has to be left on NO, this is work in progress :) . With the options given above you will use the new Euler wall implementation but using JST without dissipation term as a convective scheme for boundary nodes. This (as I say in point 2. in my above post) basically recovers the old euler wall implementation. . For the OneraM6 case the combination of new Euler + JST_BC recovers the CD & CL results of the old code. Can you also try running `CONV_NUM_METHOD_FLOW= ROE` with the code you labelled as 'SU2 FSI new (new bound condition)' and 'SU2 FSI new (oldbound condition)'. Because by doing so you switch the numerical method in the volume and to the same ROE scheme on the boundary -> just as the current default in the develop. So my current assumption is that it is a matter of convective scheme (on the boundary). ~~I'll try to attach my cases as a zip and two images here.~~; Here the green line represents the current develop if one uses MARKER_EULER or MARKER_SYM. Another info here is: by using the oldEuler wall (i.e. line 1&2) the choice of convective scheme on the boundary is irrelevant for the Euler_wall as the old implementation ""skips"" that step. The red line 4 is the setup I want you to try because this recovers the old results in this case.; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4933860/73058455-fb923880-3e93-11ea-9d49-baf87a4754e6.png); ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4933860/73058476-0351dd00-3e94-11ea-8498-37ccfdb033b0.png).

Availability,"es are definitely validation cases too. We can continue to add test cases to the TestCases repo, knowing that only a subset of those cases belong in the V&V list. 2. An important aspect of the V&V is the convergence of the solution as the mesh is refined. As Jayant knows well, this can help us catch bugs. This means that a well-constructed V&V suite needs to include a series of meshes (of increasing density), the corresponding configuration files, and the actual experimental data (or other numerical data from runs on different solvers). I strongly agree with the suggestions made that (a) the entire V&V suite needs to be run before every major release (with configuration files updated), (b) that this should be linked form the main SU2 page, (c) that the 2014 AIAA paper (and Tom’s AVIATION 2018 paper) should serve as a starting point, (d) that the NASA TMR website can give us ideas of additional access, and (e) that the SU2 V&V page should be managed within GitHub.com<http://GitHub.com> so the entire community can edit / add to this / these page/s to continue to grow the number of cases and their relevance.

As you mention, we would have to work out the logistics as this would require quite a bit of implication from the community, but the extra burden on the release would be compensated by avoiding big ""updating"" operations every now and then.

Availability,"f501dc168cd7ef4a4d1f81140a0959a9d4382128 fixes divergence of the `disc_adj_fsi` case among the parallel regression tests that occurred when using the CoDiPack type `RealReverseIndex` instead of `RealReverse`. Since the bug is not obvious from the commit and there might be a better way to fix this, let me put this up for discussion. In `CDiscAdjMultizoneDriver::SetRecording`, the tape is recorded part by part. The part of the code that is at fault involves three of them.; - `DEPENDENCIES -> OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION`: an index is last used on a right hand side; - `OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION -> TRANSFER`: the index is available for reuse and used on the left hand side; - `recording for a zone`: the index is used on a right hand side. In `CDiscAdjMultizoneDriver.cpp::ComputeAdjoints`, however, the `TRANSFER -> OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION` part of the evaluation is skipped in some cases. After the `recording for a zone` evaluation accumulated adjoints for the said index, the adjoint reset that would be performed in the skipped tape part is missing. Instead, the tape evaluation `DEPENDENCIES -> OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION` receives the adjoints for this index, which is wrong because the index is associated with a different primal variable in this part of the tape. Have there been issues regarding dependencies between tape parts previously? Are there mechanisms established that address such issues?. If someone wants to give it a try, I added a build option for the tape type in 183c3ca7a3235c8293cf2242c66c82d35a3922c7.

Switch to a [virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). This will ensure that all of your python packages are stored in single location. #### Alternate workaround. In this method, you change the hardcoded includes to match mpi4py's package location. First I figure out where my mpi4py is installed. I start a terminal session of python using the python environment I want to use (in this case, it's python 3.6), and then run:; ```; from mpi4py import MPI; MPI; ```. Since I have mpi4py installed on your system and it's on my python path, I see something like:; ```; <module 'mpi4py.MPI' from '/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mpi4py/MPI.cpython-34m.so'>; ```. The `/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python3.6/` directory is where my mpi4py package is installed. But the swig compile command includes `/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python2.7/`. That's not the right directory! So first I find the hardcoded paths of the makefile by running (on a bash terminal):; ```; grep -rn python2\.7 SU2_PY/ ; ```; On my system, this prints out four lines. I don't care about the `Makefile.in` files, because those are generated automatically and will be overwritten every time I run ""configure"" or ""preconfigure.py."" The `NUMPY_INCLUDE` line is also commented out, so I ignore that too. That leaves me with one line, line 51 of `SU2_PY/pySU2/Makefile.am`:. ```; SU2_PY/pySU2/Makefile.am:51:MPI4PY_INCLUDE = ${HOME}/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mpi4py/include \; ```. I now modify line 51 of Makefile.am to read:. ```; MPI4PY_INCLUDE = ${HOME}/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mpi4py/include \; ```. Then run configure or preconfigure.py again, and then run make again. You should be good to go!. #### tl;dr.

Availability,"for a long time. I fairly recently set up a 4 machine cluster (16 cores each) to run CFD problems on. The cluster is connected together with 1G ethernet. On SU2 v6.2 and earlier, when I ran a problem on multiple machines the time per iteration would improve up until i hit a limit where presumably network overhead exceeded the benefit of adding another machine (The limit for my set up was something like 0.5 s/iteration. . I just tried SU2 v7 on this same cluster and consistently the time per iteration gets worse when I add a second machine and double the process count. I've tried this on smaller problems (~1Mill cells) but I've also tried it on larger ones (~27Million cells). On the larger problem, one machine with 16 processes ran at 34s/iteration and 2 machines with 32 processes also ran at 34s/iteration. For that problem size, I would expect a near 2x improvement in iteration time when doubling processes. Other than this, the apples to apples comparison between SU2 v6 and v7 is otherwise very impressive where iteration times have come down even for higher CFL's. I did compile SU2 from source. I tried to compile it the same way for both v6.2 and v7 though with the different build system its a little bit harder to be certain that its all exactly the same. Given that v7 performs fine going up to 16 processes on one machine, I don't think that its a compilation issue, but admittedly I don't know all the intricacies of mpi. . Since its just multi machine that's an issue, I wonder if there's something about v7 that make it more bandwidth/latency dependent that would go away with a faster network. Or is this just a regression do to (compiler version, mpi version, a network misconfiguration...)?. Anyway I know this a bit rambling, but any help would be appreciated.

Availability,"for accuracy reasons.; - SA model was being clipped unnecessarily. This clipping has been removed. Here is my recommendation on how to run all of your 2nd-order cases going forward:. ### Euler / Laminar N-S; Turn off the limiters, unless you truly need them for preserving solution monotonicity (e.g., for shocks/discontinuities). Use ; ```; NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON= LEAST_SQUARES; ```; for robustness. Start with a CFL around 10 and converge the implicit system with LINEAR_SOLVER_ITER= 10 for each nonlinear iteration (FGMRES + ILU0 recommended). Activate the CFL adaption with. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down, factor up, CFL min value,; % CFL max value ); CFL_ADAPT= YES; CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.1, 2.0, 10.0, 1e10); ```. It is important that the linear solve behaves well for each nonlinear iteration, so if this does not converge immediately, adjust the tolerance or number of linear iterations. Roe seems very stable, but some of the other upwind schemes or centered schemes may require improved Jacobian accuracy (to recover fast convergence) with:. ```; USE_ACCURATE_FLUX_JACOBIANS= YES; CENTRAL_JACOBIAN_FIX_FACTOR= 4.0; ```. ### RANS; Due to the segregated approach for the turbulence models, you have to be more conservative with the CFL adaption. All else is the same as above, but I recommend. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down, factor up, CFL min value,; % CFL max value ); CFL_ADAPT= YES; CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.1, 1.2, 10.0, 1e3); ```. Most inviscid/laminar cases that I have tested so far converge to machine precision within a couple of hundred iterations. RANS cases within a few thousand. Ultra fine RANS meshes can still slow things down (MG could help there), but otherwise, speedups of an order of magnitude (or more) are possible for most problems. Experiment yourselves.. sometimes you can get even more performance, sometimes less, case depending.

Running the edge-loop version on 4 cores (8192 group + sorting) we get speedups (relative to reference) of **1.98** and **2.04** for the scalar and SIMD versions respectively (yes I quadruple checked).; If you are keeping track of the number two things should surprise you, the first is that there is no difference between scalar and SIMD now (the vector instruction are still there though), the second is that 4 cores give only a 2x speedup. The reason for both is: the implementation is very memory-bound, and so throwing more compute at it, either in the form of more cores or more lanes, does not help much. This is the 4 core summary:. | Code | Edge | Edge, SIMD on vars | Point | Point, SIMD on points |; | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |; | **Speed** | 2.0 | 2.0 | 3.8 | 2.8 |. I think the point-based versions scale better because they are a bit less memory-bound as they write to the gradient sequentially and they have a bit more compute due to the duplicated computations. **Conclusion**; Computing gradients via point-loops allows simpler and more generic SIMD and SPMD strategies, the resulting implementation seems to do better in the bandwidth-starved conditions typical of modern hardware (3 or more cores per memory channel).

So in a nutshell the flow solver is now capable of:. - simulating single 2D/3D turbomachinery blades using 1D characteristic-based BC or Non reflecting BC; - simulating multi-stage 2D/3D turbomachinery via a Mixing-Plane interface, including also the mixing of the turbulent quantities; - handling any kind of turbomachinery architecture (AXIAL, CENTRIFUGAL, CENTRIPETAL and mixed such as CENTRIPETAL_AXIAL or AXIAL_CENTRIFUGAL); - selecting 2 different kind of interpolation methods for the mixing-plane interface: LINEAR_INTERPOLATION and NEAREST_NEIGHBOR; - handling an unlimited number of blades/stages —> (zones); - simulating turbomachinery which works on the NICFD regime such as supercritical CO2 compressors or Organic Rankine Cycle turbines.; - printing history_x.dat file for multi-zone convergence monitoring; - printing some post-processing thermodynamic, kinematic and geometric quantities in some files inside a TURBOMACHINERY folder. The limitations of the turbomachinery capabilities are:. - the axis of rotation should be always the Z one; - MGL acceleration technique is not working because of some un-resolved issues with the periodic BC. This pull request introduce also some limited design capability for turbomachinery applications. Using the AD tool, it is now available on the suite also a single zone discrete adjoint to compute the sensitivity for 2D/3D turbomachinery blade with respect to certain performance parameters (ENTROPY_GENERATION, TOTAL_PRESSURE_LOSS, KINETIC_ENERGY_LOSS, ecc.). However, the optimization script only works for 2D blades since the FFD and the mesh deformation routines need still to be adapted to handle 3D blades (especially for problem on the deformation of the hub and shroud surfaces).",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/413:2510,avail,available,2510,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/413,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"gs mentioned above. However, the current implementation in develop only works correctly for PARAVIEW_MULTIBLOCK and for RESTART type output files. This is because in the case of PARAVIEW_MULTIBLOCK, the additional file output using the iteration number in the filename, is performed in the switch case block directly. . For all other output files, the switch case block only generates the correct filename with the iteration number appended. After the switch block, it is (wrongly) checked if (and only if) the WRT_RESTART_OVERWRITE flag is set to NO. If so, the additional file is written. Therefore, this logic only works correctly for RESTART files (and PARAVIEW_MULTIBLOCK files, because for that format, the file dump is independent of the file dump after the switch block. . The proposed fix here introduces a local boolean (doWriteIterFile) that acts as a switch for the additional file dump. It is set in the switch case block and afterwards it is checked if this variable is true or false. Based on this value, the file dump is executed or not. Furthermore, the fix introduces and corrects some comments to make the function easier to understand. ## Related Work; The flags are already available in the develop branch as config options but they don't work as expected. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

With the symmetry plane, the results differ from the other inviscid solutions but the agreement to the experiment is better. I couldn't get hold of reference drag or moment results to compare against, therefore the comparison is only against lift. I also tested the pitching NACA 0012 airfoil using Batina's ""Unsteady Euler Airfoil Solutions Using Unstructured Dynamic Meshes"" as reference. In this case with the NACA 0012 airfoil, the reduced frequency (k=0.0814) is lower than the previous case and the amplitude is slightly higher at 2.51deg. .

The sign convention was inverted in the paper and neither BC matched exactly to the reference which had a coarser mesh than the one used here but the Euler wall looks to be in better agreement with the reference and captures the overall shape. I've attached the case files for this as well and it would be interesting to see the results when run with the change you've made to reproduce the same convective flux strategy at the boundary. As a final test I ran the rotating frame case, again from @economon 's thesis which is a steady problem with simulated grid motion. I was able to run and replicate the flow characteristics using the Euler wall boundary condition but with symmetry plane the residuals were straightaway at machine precision and the flow never develops around the airfoil.

Availability,"https://github.com/su2code/SU2/assets/116454159/4d04287e-b111-45b5-96dd-6b9cc5f18217). It appears that there may be either a misunderstanding on my part with the implementation of SST-V2003m w/ MUSCL, or that a bug exists in SU2 for it. I got very unusual and different results when using MUSCL vs. not. To further look into this, I also completed additional simulations using `KIND_TURB_MODEL=SA`, which got me much more reasonable-looking results. Please see the plots below:. ![image](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/assets/116454159/e5d80bbd-9bc2-4f3c-a6e2-bb5dfc43336b); ![image](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/assets/116454159/3804bdf1-7f99-4584-9683-cfbfd7dfa916). Lastly, here is the config file:; [config.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/12155765/M6_LowRe.txt). Note that the ""MUSCL=ON"" in the plots indicate the solution for both `MUSCL_FLOW=YES` and `MUSCL_TURB=YES`. That is the only difference between config files. Also, I tried using `MARKER_RIEMANN`, `MARKER_OUTLET`, and `MARKER_SUPERSONIC_OUTLET` on the outlets with no success on fixing this discrepancy, so I believe it is not related to the boundary conditions. **Bug report checklist**; *Please make sure that you have followed the checklist below, many common problems can be solved by:*. - [X] Consulting the build instructions (https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Build-SU2-Linux-MacOS/).; - [x] Looking for similar problems on GitHub or CFD-Online (https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2/).; - [X] Updating to the newest version of SU2 (either develop, master, or the pre-built executables https://su2code.github.io/download.html). **Desktop (please complete the following information):**; - OS: [e.g., Linux (CentOS 7)]; - C++ compiler and version: GCC 9.1.0; - MPI implementation and version: Intel MPI 19.0.9; - SU2 Version: v7.5.1 but with following additional commits cherry-picked:; - 8ce4c3fd5e030949d037e073e1b4418e51c87540; - 07645b1b70d1dbfcf3d96acfeb10c560532ad60f; - 54af111101f4aab98cc4589e2242d9cd06730618",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2088:2051,down,download,2051,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2088,1,['down'],['download']

Availability,"iating tests, grouping tests into suites, and running checks. This choice was based on what is available in our development setup. We have integrated our unit tests into our Travis CI regression testing. Every time we push commits or submit a pull request, the unit tests are run and checked. What is my vision for unit testing in SU2?. I am not proposing that we start trying to get 100% code coverage with pre-existing code. That would not provide a good return on investment. Instead, I see people adding unit tests as they write new code and as they find bugs. For each new behavior added to SU2, tests are first added to document the related existing behavior. These tests serve to check that the existing behavior isn't damaged by the new code. Then new tests are added to prove that the new behavior is working correctly. For bug fixes, the process is simpler. A test is added to confirm that something is not behaving as expected. Then the code is fixed to make the test pass. What frameworks are available?. For a unit testing framework, here are the most popular options, with the following pros and cons:. Roll-your-own. * Requires no external dependencies; * The most flexible option; * Involves the most work to setup; * Will lack some of the more advances features of mature unit-testing frameworks. Boost Test. * Can be header only, statically linked, or dynamically linked; * If statically or dynamically linked, then Boost is not very lightweight; * Easy to add if you're already using Boost. Google Test. * Most common unit-testing framework; * Can be easily combined with Google's powerful GMock mocking library; * Compiling and linking can be somewhat painful.

Availability,"in those regions but its still higher than freestream. Increasing the 2nd coefficient also makes the shock resolution in the rest of the flow field very smooth (looks like a smudge on the screen). Is there a reason why this happens? I did a few first order upwind simulations; they converge almost instantly and the higher Mach region does not exist. Nor does it exist in 2nd order upwind scheme, but these dont converge any further than -4. I want to conduct optimisation, for which the JST scheme shows good stability and convergence for adjoint problems. I have uploaded the config file, convergence history and images of the high Mach region around the leading edge here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HtBwS9rVuWn5IJoDpMCCpRyYehOTk9by?usp=drive_link. The history file also contains information of the meshes (number of cells and y+ values). I uploaded one of the converging meshes (v_coarse.su2) and one of the diverging meshes (medium.su2). I used WEIGHTED_LEAST_SQUARES to help with the sharp edge; this decreases the Mach in the region but not by much (~9 for the very_coarse mesh). I have also run the RANS solver with JST, but there is no significant difference from using NS with WEIGHTED_LEAST_SQUARES; the Mach number in the region 8.74.

The critical part of this error seems to be the Error in TokenizeString() message, suggesting an issue with parsing the configuration file. This error typically indicates a syntax problem, such as having multiple options on a single line without proper separation by an equal sign (=). However, upon reviewing _adap/ini/config_CFD.cfg_, was unable to find any lines that clearly violated this syntax rule. Could this error be indicative of a more subtle issue within the configuration file, or might it be related to specific aspects of the feature_adap branch? Any insights, suggestions, or guidance on how to troubleshoot this error would be greatly appreciated. If anyone has a working adapt_mesh.cfg file for a similar setup or for the feature_adap branch, I would be very interested in seeing it.

Availability,"irectories with different configurations (like for a debug build etc); - ninja uses all available cores in your system by default. Still you can set the number of jobs using `-j N`. ### Additional notes; - Meson requires python 3, so implicitly we get this requirement now. But I think it is less of a problem than some of you probably might think. A lot of problems we have come from the fact the we support python 2 and python 3. As I was setting up travis (getting there in a moment) I noticed that is easily possible to compile the code with python 3 (for the python wrapper) and run the python scripts with python 2 and vice versa, which eventually leads to errors and crashes. If we require(!) version 3 (which should be installed on all machines now ...) we can avoid such problems from the beginning. Furthermore, python 2 is deprecated anyway ... - I already changed travis to use the new build system. This as one major advantage: we can now properly use ccache and the caching feature of travis (that means only files that have changed will be compiled if a cache is available). This should speed up the runs by a lot. . - automake and meson can coexist without any problems. Maybe we can keep this compatibility for version 7 and remove it later if we all agree. Also the preconfigure.py should not be necessary anymore then. - (unit) tests can be easily added and integrated into the build process. - I will add a proper documentation soon. ## Related Work; *Resolve any issues (bug fix or feature request), note any related PRs, or mention interactions with the work of others, if any.*. #685 . ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"irst;; size_t jPoint = connectivity[iEdge].second;; ```; Apologies for the macro but it is just to illustrate that if we re-sort edge data after coloring the edge index is the loop index, otherwise the edge indices for each color need to be stored in a separate array.; Note that for each edge loop we first loop over colors, then over same-color edges, it is this inner loop that can run in parallel in chunk sizes that are multiple of the group size considered during coloring. There is some runtime cost on entry to every #omp parallel section, with coloring we enter one such section once by color. I mentioned in the introduction coloring reduces locality and therefore performance, here is the effect of color group size on the execution time of the scalar code on one thread:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38071223/64686801-2e0d3d00-d481-11e9-82a0-c56e5554cd83.png); The hassle-free option of not sorting by color ""never"" recovers the performance of the base algorithm, things are even worse for the SIMD version where even at group size of 8192 with re-sorting the slowdown is 14%. Running the edge-loop version on 4 cores (8192 group + sorting) we get speedups (relative to reference) of **1.98** and **2.04** for the scalar and SIMD versions respectively (yes I quadruple checked).; If you are keeping track of the number two things should surprise you, the first is that there is no difference between scalar and SIMD now (the vector instruction are still there though), the second is that 4 cores give only a 2x speedup. The reason for both is: the implementation is very memory-bound, and so throwing more compute at it, either in the form of more cores or more lanes, does not help much. This is the 4 core summary:. | Code | Edge | Edge, SIMD on vars | Point | Point, SIMD on points |; | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |; | **Speed** | 2.0 | 2.0 | 3.8 | 2.8 |.

Availability,"it testing library for the following reasons:. + It can be included as a header-only library.; + It has a very clean, easy-to-use syntax; + It has widespread use, including the FEniCS library. ### Design choices. The following design choices are in place. If you disagree with them, then please start a discussion here:. + All tests are placed in a root-level directory named `UnitTests`. Inside this directory is a structure just like the existing folder structure (e.g. `SU2_CFD/numerics`), except that there are not separate `src` and `include` folders.; + Tests are grouped by class, and put in files such as `CNumerics_tests.cpp`.; + A single test executable is compiled and run, as opposed to a separate test executable for each group of tests. With the single test executable, you can always filter down to groups of tests or individual tests.; + When `ninja test` or `meson test` is run, the test executable is only run once, sweeping through all the unit tests. The result only shows a single failure or a single success. If more detail is desired, then the test executable can be run manually.; + The relevant SU2 code is compiled as a library (e.g. `libSU2core`) and then linked into both the main executable (`SU2_CFD`) and the test program (`test_driver`). ### How to Run Unit Tests. If you compile SU2 using `ninja -C builddir`, then the test executable will automatically be compiled. You then have three options for running the tests:. + `meson test` (see documentation [here](https://mesonbuild.com/Unit-tests.html)); + `ninja test`; + Run the exectuable manually: `./UnitTests/test_driver`. When running the executable manually, there are many customization options. Run `./UnitTests/test_driver --help` to see them all. ### How to add unit tests. I have already included a single unit-test example (`UnitTests/SU2_CFD/src/numerics/CNumerics_tests.cpp`). Aside from the headaches with CConfig, this example should be clear.

Availability,"it-tests-for-scientific-research-codes). ## What do I propose?. Our research group at UT Austin has implemented a unit testing framework on our branch, which we're happy with. Some choices were arbitrary, and some choices were made based on our development environment. Those choices may be different for other groups. Here's what we have done:. The unit testing framework is compiled and run using autotools. For more information on autotool's setup, see [their documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Tests.html). Since autotools is the build system for SU2, this involves minimal changes. Using automake, the build process for building unit tests becomes:. ```; ./bootstrap; ./configure; make; make check; ```. We use [Boost's unit testing framework](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html). This provides a convenient set of macros for instatiating tests, grouping tests into suites, and running checks. This choice was based on what is available in our development setup. We have integrated our unit tests into our Travis CI regression testing. Every time we push commits or submit a pull request, the unit tests are run and checked. ## What is my vision for unit testing in SU2?. I am *not* proposing that we start trying to get 100% code coverage with pre-existing code. That would not provide a good return on investment. Instead, I see people adding unit tests as they write new code and as they find bugs. For each new behavior added to SU2, tests are first added to document the related existing behavior. These tests serve to check that the existing behavior isn't damaged by the new code. Then new tests are added to prove that the new behavior is working correctly. For bug fixes, the process is simpler. A test is added to confirm that something is not behaving as expected. Then the code is fixed to make the test pass. ## What frameworks are available?.

Finally, I wanted to also try the algorithmic differentiation, so I changed the parameter MATH_PROBLEM to DISCRETE_ADJOINT in the configuration file and:. $ SU2_CFD_AD inv_dadj_NACA0012.cfg. I failed to obtain a correct adjoint solution (I expected to see something really similar to what I got with the CONTINUOUS_ADJOINT method): the density adjoint field seems to have a completely different scale (instead of having values in the approximate range -200 ÷ +200, it has values in the range -0.264 ÷ +0.217 and the values not too close to zero are concentrated in an area near the farfield boundary, far from the airfoil).

Implementation errors found:; - Use of production limiter constant in the clipping of the cross-diffusion term for the computation of the F1 blending function in CTurbSSTVariable.cpp. ; - SST naming conventions (V in V2003m should stay for Vorticity production term.). Not yet assessed.; - Wrong cross-diffusion term included into the residual of w in turb_sources.hpp. It should not be only the positive value as considered in the computation of the F1 blending function. As stated in https://doi.org/10.2514/3.12149. ""CDkw is the; positive portion of the cross-diffusion term in Eq (A2)"" pag. 1604. Moreover, a clipping has been introduced for large negative values of this term, as suggested in Peng, Shia-Hui, Peter Eliasson, and Lars Davidson.

A fix has been proposed following @pcarruscag suggestions for the supersonic inlet BC.; - Boundary conditions definitions are different than the ones proposed in TMR. Maybe give the user the choice to use the BCs implemented in SU2 or the ones from TMR. Changes to SST model proposed:; - Inclusion of non modified versions of SST. In this case I think that more work is needed to be sure that the correct terms are taken into account everywhere in the code.; - Give the user the possibility of changing the production limiter for TKE (not essential).; - Change values of default turbulent to laminar viscosity to 1e-2 (NASA TMR reports that it should be in the range of 1e-2 to 1e-5, but in SU2 this is set to 10 as default). .

Beyond adding robustness allowing the the use of a CFL of 200 which diverges under the original limit , the modified limit allows for better convergence of the flow and turbulence residuals for CFL of 50. Plots of the Lift and drag Coefficients are added here showing that results are not affected by the new limit, and additionally convergence is slightly quicker for the lift coefficient even with a CFL of 50 . . ![CL](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/assets/139676851/61adc0af-9449-41e8-aac7-e985ca3c9bdb); ![CD](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/assets/139676851/17b877df-7eff-47d4-9a77-95e3ccd2afcd). ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

MPI support will be enabled by default if a proper mpi installation can be found. ; Finally compile the code with; ```; ninja -C build; ```. - ""build"" in the commands above is a folder where the configuration will be stored. You can configure multiple directories with different configurations (like for a debug build etc); - ninja uses all available cores in your system by default. Still you can set the number of jobs using `-j N`. ### Additional notes; - Meson requires python 3, so implicitly we get this requirement now. But I think it is less of a problem than some of you probably might think. A lot of problems we have come from the fact the we support python 2 and python 3. As I was setting up travis (getting there in a moment) I noticed that is easily possible to compile the code with python 3 (for the python wrapper) and run the python scripts with python 2 and vice versa, which eventually leads to errors and crashes. If we require(!) version 3 (which should be installed on all machines now ...) we can avoid such problems from the beginning. Furthermore, python 2 is deprecated anyway ... - I already changed travis to use the new build system. This as one major advantage: we can now properly use ccache and the caching feature of travis (that means only files that have changed will be compiled if a cache is available). This should speed up the runs by a lot. . - automake and meson can coexist without any problems. Maybe we can keep this compatibility for version 7 and remove it later if we all agree. Also the preconfigure.py should not be necessary anymore then. - (unit) tests can be easily added and integrated into the build process. - I will add a proper documentation soon. ## Related Work; *Resolve any issues (bug fix or feature request), note any related PRs, or mention int",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/745:2678,error,errors,2678,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/745,1,['error'],['errors']

This is compiler-specific and may bloat the result binary with unnecessary symbols. But it's the quickest way.; 2. I tried to make changes so the interaction with the code is minimal so I went and took advantage of **CSolverFactory::CreateSubSolver()** to create a pointer to self-registered **CEulerSolver**.; 3. By the way, I thought the solver would be created only once. Little I knew!; 4. Anyway, The registration works as expected now.

The exact set of rules has been tweaked slightly, but you should see almost exactly the same types of alerts as you were used to on LGTM.com: we’ve enabled the [`security-and-quality` query suite](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#using-queries-in-ql-packs) for you. #### How do I upgrade my CodeQL engine?; No need! New versions of the CodeQL analysis are constantly deployed on GitHub.com; your repository will automatically benefit from the most recently released version. #### The analysis doesn’t seem to be working; If you get an error in GitHub Actions that indicates that CodeQL wasn’t able to analyze your code, please [follow the instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/troubleshooting-the-codeql-workflow) to debug the analysis. #### How do I disable LGTM.com?; If you have LGTM’s automatic pull request analysis enabled, then you can [follow these steps to disable the LGTM pull request analysis](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/managing-automated-code-review#disabling-pr-integration). You don’t actually need to remove your repository from LGTM.com; it will automatically be removed in the next few months as part of the deprecation of LGTM.com ([more info here](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/)). #### Which source code hosting platforms does code scanning support?; GitHub code scanning is deeply integrated within GitHub itself.

So the chance for manual errors is much lower. **Additional Notes**; A few things ahead, I run FGMRES+ILU for all configurations. No periodic boundaries at all. I went without turbulence for the cht cases to make it simpler. In the past and now we were able to see some good gradient validation against FD. So this issue is not super dramatic (although I am pretty annoyed by that) and I think I simply overlooked it in the past. In case there is sth unclear pls let me know, I'll will try to clarify asap.

Availability,"p size is wildly varying depending on the optimization objectives/constraints, scales of the geometry, and types/numbers of design variables that are being used. You have to play this game of scaling the objectives and constraints in different ways to coax out the ideal first step. In my limited testing, the value of 1E-6 for the gradient norm seems to work well for 3D RANS aerodynamic shape optimizations of an aircraft wing when using FFD control points to change the shape of the wing. This is a specific use case that was the subject of a lot of the underlying research that resulted in the shape optimization framework. Which is likely why I have had good results using this rule of thumb. . > Is 1E-6 a good rule? Or is it just a decent starting point, and values very different from 1E-6 are used in practice? Also, if this is ""a good rule,"" then shouldn't we just automatically rescale the problem after the first design iteration?. Scaling in an optimization problem can be pretty frustrating and time consuming. Anecdotally, I have been using @economon 's suggestions of leaving everything else as default (value of 1) and only playing with the objective and constraint scalings to get a good first step size. As mentioned before, this step size is of different values for different problems, which is why it is difficult to come up with universal scalings that would work for most problems. But I am hoping to address some of these scaling issues in #923 . . I haven't really found much good literature on this problem, but I might be looking in the wrong places. Recommendations are welcome. . A big boon is having a robust solver. If it can handle flow simulations with odd geometries, you need to do less parameter tweaking. The reason you need good scaling is so that the optimizer doesn't explore difficult parts of the design space. If the simulation diverges, the optimization fails. Some intelligent handling of simulation divergences would also help the optimization framework.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/733#issuecomment-616810829:2007,robust,robust,2007,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/733#issuecomment-616810829,1,['robust'],['robust']

Availability,"pers/sobolev.pdf); This is done by solving an elliptic PDE with the sensitivities, i.e., ( e1 Id - e2 Laplace) delta_x = - dF / dx, with different weights e1, e2. Inserting the sensitivities from the discrete adjoint solver for (dF / dx) leads to the gradient in a Sobolev space.; The method can be extended to incorporate the parameterization of the mesh cells x=M(p) with design values p, [see here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15279) Using the projected gradient w.r.t. the design values the systems takes the form; (dM/dp)^T (e1 Id - e2 Laplace) (dM/dp) = - dF/dp. Such treatment can help prevent noise in the derivative computation and leads to smoother design updates. Especially, when working in a One-Shot optimization context.; Here the optimization is done with inexact function values and gradients, i.e., the flow and adjoint solvers are only partially converged between design updates. For this setting simple gradient descent with too large update steps will not work, since a few flow iterations are not enough to recover a solution from the restart file from the last optimization step.; See the graphic below for drag minimization of a NACA 0012 airfoil with constant lift, where the Sobolev solver for the gradient leads to smoother deformations and better optimization.; ![pullrequest1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16785869/143250126-e5bdd360-e265-40ca-9d24-5811ecbb759c.jpg). Application is done as a post-processing step in the SU2_DOT_AD executable.; The new solver constructs the necessary operator and solves it using the features of the finite element implementation in SU2.

MPI_FLOAT : MPI_DOUBLE;; SelectMPIWrapper<ScalarType>::W::Allreduce(&sum, &dotRes, 1, mpi_type, MPI_SUM, SU2_MPI::GetComm());; ```; just outside the conditional then the code runs past that point and iterates normally. For that case it does not create any unwanted sideeffects. The explanatory comment; ```; * The nElm condition is to allow vectors to also be used locally. ---*/; ```; did not really enlighten me. I guess we have `nElm==nElmDomain` if we run without domain decomposition i.e. size=1. And as soon as size>1 `nElm` should be larger than `nElmDomain` as there is communication overhead ... at least how SU2 does it? So maybe the computation of those nElm values is not ok (I will look in that direction). On the other hand I guess such coding style (of putting mpi commands behind conditionals with local vars) provokes these errors? . 🆘 thanks already for the help and feel free to mention things I should try .

Availability,"r today. During the output of the periodic mesh in `SU2_MSH`, `CPeriodicGeometry::SetMeshFile` sorts the nodes into the order normal, receive, send. This can be found in [lines 18798-18819 of Common/src/geometry_structure](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/blob/68991cd1005cf118e1ff21b8952bb366bb299cf3/Common/src/geometry_structure.cpp#L18798). I've copied down the lines here for reference:. ```cpp; /*--- Change the numbering to guarantee that the all the receive; points are at the end of the file ---*/; unsigned long OldnPoint = geometry->GetnPoint();; unsigned long *NewSort = new unsigned long[nPoint];; for (iPoint = 0; iPoint < nPoint; iPoint++) {; NewSort[iPoint] = iPoint;; }; ; unsigned long Index = OldnPoint-1;; for (iMarker = 0; iMarker < nMarker; iMarker++) {; if (bound[iMarker][0]->GetVTK_Type() == VERTEX) {; if (config->GetMarker_All_SendRecv(iMarker) < 0) {; for (iElem_Bound = 0; iElem_Bound < nElem_Bound[iMarker]; iElem_Bound++) {; if (bound[iMarker][iElem_Bound]->GetNode(0) < geometry->GetnPoint()) {; NewSort[bound[iMarker][iElem_Bound]->GetNode(0)] = Index;; NewSort[Index] = bound[iMarker][iElem_Bound]->GetNode(0);; Index--;; }; }; }; }; }; ```. In order to sort the points, a list mapping the old points to the new points (`NewSort`) is created. The problem is that this list is sorted by switching nodes. But it doesn't switch around the _contents_ of the list (i.e. two node numbers from the list). Instead it switched an index from the list and an actual node number pulled from the geometry. This presents two problems:. 1. If any of the receive nodes actually are at the end of the list, they will get switched away from the end of the list.; 2. If any node is switched twice, data is lost. That's because the sorting assumes that the elements being switched have not already been switched. This is how the three points went missing from the cube problem I previously referenced. If my write-up is too confusing, I can provide a play-by-play of how the error occurs.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/431#issuecomment-358340153:2063,error,error,2063,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/431#issuecomment-358340153,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"re sophisticated controller for nonlinear iterations along with several other important modifications. The changes are the following:; - New under-relaxation strategy. Variables such as density and energy are only allowed to change by +/- 20% with each nonlinear iteration by applying an under-relaxation parameter to the updates at each node, which helps with difficult transients, especially at calculation startup. Also applied to turbulence model updates (though threshold is larger).; - CFL adaption via an exponential progression with under-relaxation approach, i.e., changes to CFL are coupled to the under-relaxation parameter (small under-relaxation parameter = decrease, and large = increase). CFL is now locally defined for each CV for this process.; - Modified realizability checks to avoid negative density/pressure/temperature at the nodes and also during 2nd-order reconstruction at cell faces.; - CV face states for 2nd-order MUSCL are now optionally reconstructed with a separate gradient method (unweighted least squares recommended), which is very important for robustness. Gradients for viscous terms and sources are still computed via GG or WLS for accuracy reasons.; - SA model was being clipped unnecessarily. This clipping has been removed. Here is my recommendation on how to run all of your 2nd-order cases going forward:. ### Euler / Laminar N-S; Turn off the limiters, unless you truly need them for preserving solution monotonicity (e.g., for shocks/discontinuities). Use ; ```; NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON= LEAST_SQUARES; ```; for robustness. Start with a CFL around 10 and converge the implicit system with LINEAR_SOLVER_ITER= 10 for each nonlinear iteration (FGMRES + ILU0 recommended). Activate the CFL adaption with. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down, factor up, CFL min value,; % CFL max value ); CFL_ADAPT= YES; CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.1, 2.0, 10.0, 1e10); ```.

Furthermore the Inlet BC were tried with many different vertical speeds (vx=0/0.001/0.01/0.1/1/10). Simulations with the inlet, farfield and outlet as TOTAL_INLET, FARFIELD, OUTLET and EULER and some (not all) combination between these BC were tried. The mesh was generated with Salome-Meca. It is a tetrahedral mesh. I have a script that permits to change the domain size with ease. So from the mesh perspective it is fairly easy to test different mesh sizes and domain sizes.; Generally the outer domain radius was between 1.5*propRadius to 10*propRadus. Domain height between 3*propRadius to 15*propRadius. The prop was at 2/3 of the total height (1/2 and 3/4 were also tested). Some simulations approximated from a far experimental results (thrust +/-10% error, torque +/-15%). Some completely diverged some converge towards something way out of the 10% error range. **To Reproduce**.

Availability,"riants). For steps 1 and 4 however, there is no such option: these steps must be executed by a ""command-line call"" in a newly spawned sub-process, as is done in the SU2 Python tools, in `SU2.run.DEF` and `SU2.run.DOT` respectively. However, spawning new -- parallel -- processes using `subprocess` from within an MPI environment is ""dangerous"", besides being rather rude towards workload managers such as Slurm, making this an unviable solution in this kind of application. **Proposed solution**; If at all reasonable, I would like to have the functionality of `SU2_DEF` and `SU2_DOT_AD` exposed to the Python wrappers `pysu2` and `pysu2ad`, ideally using an approach which is consistent with the existing implementation for `SU2_CFD` and `SU2_CFD_AD`. If I understand correctly, this change would require something along the lines of: . - Refactoring the main functions of `SU2_DEF.cpp` and `SU2_DOT_AD.cpp` into new driver classes, e.g. `CDeformationDriver` and `CDiscAdjProjectionDriver`, broken down into pre-processing, execution, output, and postprocessing.; - Exposing these new driver classes to Python through a SWIG `.i` file. Beyond offering a solution to the problem described above, allowing the complete optimisation iteration to be controlled externally (for example by an MDO framework), this might in the long term also allow providing deformations to the `SU2_DEF` routine directly in Python, as an alternative to the surface deformation file. Similarly, the surface sensitivities resulting from `SU2_DOT_AD` could be accessed directly in Python for post-processing. **Alternatives**; The proposed solution is hopefully a starting point for some discussion, should there be interest in the issue. Suggestions which could help with the refinement and implementation of the proposed solution, or any alternative, would be very welcome. **Disclaimer**; Please excuse the long read.

Availability,"rite-unit-tests-for-scientific-research-codes>. What do I propose?. My research group at UT Austing has implemented a unit testing framework on our branch, which we're happy with. Some choices were arbitrary, and some choices were made based on our development environment. Those choices may be different for other groups. Here's what we have done:. The unit testing framework is compiled and run using autotools. For more information on autotool's setup, see their documentation<https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Tests.html>. Since autotools is the build system for SU2, this involves minimal changes. Using automake, the build process for building unit tests becomes:. '''; ./bootstrap; ./configure; make; make check; '''. We use Boost's unit testing framework<https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html>. This provides a convenient set of macros for instatiating tests, grouping tests into suites, and running checks. This choice was based on what is available in our development setup. We have integrated our unit tests into our Travis CI regression testing. Every time we push commits or submit a pull request, the unit tests are run and checked. What is my vision for unit testing in SU2?. I am not proposing that we start trying to get 100% code coverage with pre-existing code. That would not provide a good return on investment. Instead, I see people adding unit tests as they write new code and as they find bugs. For each new behavior added to SU2, tests are first added to document the related existing behavior. These tests serve to check that the existing behavior isn't damaged by the new code. Then new tests are added to prove that the new behavior is working correctly. For bug fixes, the process is simpler. A test is added to confirm that something is not behaving as expected. Then the code is fixed to make the test pass. What frameworks are available?. For a unit testing framework, here are the most popular options, with the follo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/698#issuecomment-499250240:3344,avail,available,3344,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/698#issuecomment-499250240,2,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"rmation on this topic in the documentation would be extremely helpful to a new user in understanding the differences between the available limiters and their respective strengths/weaknesses.

However, it is incomplete and contains very little new information. . **Describe the solution you'd like**; We would like to contribute more to this idea. Specifically, we would like to add. - A description of why slope limiters are used in a FVM formulation. This can explain the concept of Total Variation Diminishing methods, monotonic schemes, and 2nd order accuracy requirements. ; - Mathematically describe the limiters available to the user in SU2. This will include a brief discussion of their properties (e.g., diffusivity, tunable parameters) and potential Sweby plots. ; - An empirical comparison of the available limiters on a test problem(s). One problem that was considered was the laminar cylinder, or the viscous wedge cases. The flowfield colored by the limiter value can be shown to the user. . **Describe alternatives you've considered**; N/A. **Additional context**; This issue ticket is part of an open-source community contribution assignment in our graduate studies ""Numerical Solutions to Partial Differential Equations"".

Availability,"rrectly pass](https://travis-ci.org/su2code/SU2/builds/597983817) the travis tests [when the branch is based in feature_input_output](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/compare/feature_input_output...654ba3dfc207e25c31da9c09860224ad4044a610), which was the original branch merged in #724. . Unfortunately, given that during this time both #753 and #774 were merged, the tests are failing now. Particularly, the disc_adj_fsi case runs into a segfault in `CDiscAdjSolver::ExtractAdjoint_CrossTerm_Geometry`, when trying to execute ; `geometry->node[iPoint]->GetAdjointCoord(Solution_Geometry);`. . I believe this is related to the changes to the index based recording introduced in #774, as the code was running before into the same problem in `CDiscAdjSolver::ExtractAdjoint_CrossTerm`, and now goes beyond this point having changed the Get routine into `direct_solver->GetNodes()->GetAdjointSolution_intIndexBased(iPoint,Solution);`. Currently, there is no `GetAdjointCoord_intIndexBased` or similar available, and its implementation requires some constructs for the indices. Therefore, I would like to ask for support from @oleburghardt and @pcarruscag to make this work with their changes. ## Related Work; #724 involuntarily removed the discrete adjoint FSI cases from the regression tests.; Branch [fix_discadjfsi](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/fix_discadjfsi) successfully recovers the functionality removed.; #774 introduced relevant changes to the adjoint solver that are making.; #753 was merged and, although I tried to adapt to it, I can't guarantee it's working correctly. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

The Default is `CUpwRoe_Flow` (`ROE`) and I added `CCentJST_Flow_BC` which is the normal `JST` without dissipation. ; The third option `MUSCL_ADJFLOW` has to be left on NO, this is work in progress :) . With the options given above you will use the new Euler wall implementation but using JST without dissipation term as a convective scheme for boundary nodes. This (as I say in point 2. in my above post) basically recovers the old euler wall implementation. . For the OneraM6 case the combination of new Euler + JST_BC recovers the CD & CL results of the old code. Can you also try running `CONV_NUM_METHOD_FLOW= ROE` with the code you labelled as 'SU2 FSI new (new bound condition)' and 'SU2 FSI new (oldbound condition)'. Because by doing so you switch the numerical method in the volume and to the same ROE scheme on the boundary -> just as the current default in the develop. So my current assumption is that it is a matter of convective scheme (on the boundary). ~~I'll try to attach my cases as a zip and two images here.~~; Here the green line represents the current develop if one uses MARKER_EULER or MARKER_SYM. Another info here is: by using the oldEuler wall (i.e. line 1&2) the choice of convective scheme on the boundary is irrelevant for the Euler_wall as the old implementation ""skips"" that step. The red line 4 is the setup I want you to try because this recovers the old results in this case.; ![image](",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/828#issuecomment-578048838:1134,recover,recovers,1134,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/828#issuecomment-578048838,1,['recover'],['recovers']

Availability,"s nowadays, so we should always be improving the class design accordingly. I suppose this will just get more important with adding more physics, zones, and more complex time integration schemes. I would like to highlight that when the code was first released, we did not have ""zones"" at all (not until some early sliding mesh work after a couple of versions), and the CDriver and CIteration classes didn't even exist until we dreamed them up a couple of years ago. My point is that, with some proper planning, we have the creativity and the right team to develop the solution we need, and we shouldn't be afraid to make big changes when necessary. Moving quickly while leveraging the team's broad skillset is one of our biggest advantages in this project. As you all know, over the years, we continue to move toward a *_structure.cpp and *_physics.cpp mindset for how we do our abstractions/data encapsulations, with ""structure"" components reused and ""physics"" components being specialized to a certain set of governing equations. This has happened in many places, including recently with the CTransfer class, for instance, and it is likely to happen with the COutput class(es) before long. However, one area where there hasn't been much evolution is within the CIntegration classes. Apart from a couple of additions for structural problems and now the DG integration, it is largely the same as it was in the first release. Perhaps this is our opportunity to rethink and update these classes for future expansion, just as we've done for others over the years. We could rework them, move them up or down in the hierarchy, change where they're instantiated, change the inheritance, and so on. Even if they get a little more complicated (like usual), as long as they're properly abstracted, it isn't likely to bother the developers working in other areas of the code too much. In short, I think some effort spent on the CIntegration classes could help here, and they are due for some updates anyway.

Availability,"s of problems does CodeQL find?; The CodeQL engine that powers GitHub code scanning is the exact same engine that powers LGTM.com. The exact set of rules has been tweaked slightly, but you should see almost exactly the same types of alerts as you were used to on LGTM.com: we’ve enabled the [`security-and-quality` query suite](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#using-queries-in-ql-packs) for you. #### How do I upgrade my CodeQL engine?; No need! New versions of the CodeQL analysis are constantly deployed on GitHub.com; your repository will automatically benefit from the most recently released version. #### The analysis doesn’t seem to be working; If you get an error in GitHub Actions that indicates that CodeQL wasn’t able to analyze your code, please [follow the instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/troubleshooting-the-codeql-workflow) to debug the analysis. #### How do I disable LGTM.com?; If you have LGTM’s automatic pull request analysis enabled, then you can [follow these steps to disable the LGTM pull request analysis](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/managing-automated-code-review#disabling-pr-integration). You don’t actually need to remove your repository from LGTM.com; it will automatically be removed in the next few months as part of the deprecation of LGTM.com ([more info here](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/)). #### Which source code hosting platforms does code scanning support?; GitHub code scanning is deeply integrated within GitHub itself. If you’d like to scan source code that is hosted elsewhere, we suggest that you create a mirror of that code on GitHub. #### How do I know this PR is legitimate?; This PR is filed by the official LGTM.com GitHub App, in line with the [deprecation timeline that was announ",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1840:3708,error,errors,3708,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1840,1,['error'],['errors']

Availability,"several (multiblock structured) meshes:; - Gmsh (1M cells), SU2 and CGNS format; - ICEM (10M cells), CGNS format. At the preprocessing stage when computing the projection area of the EBW in the z-plane, I noticed that the meshes generated by Gmsh gave a wrong projection (~30 m2 instead of ~40 m2!).; I increased the height of the first cell in the boundary layer (which was set to match y+ ~ 1) and the problem disappeared when y+ got close to 30. Of course, this mesh is not usable without wall functions...; However, it does not seem to be the only problem since:; - the ICEM mesh does not converge to the expected value of Cl; - a colleague ran both (Gmsh and ICEM) meshes with identical settings on the commercial solver CFD++ and got the expected results (Cl = [0.4;0.5]). I also tried to tune these different numerical parameters, without success:; - ROE (2nd order with Vankatakrishnan/Vankatakrishnan-Wang limiter) and JST numerical schemes; - Green-Gauss or Weighted Least Square for gradients; - LU_SGS and ILU linear solver preconditionners. To make sure that SU2 was correctly compiled, I also:; - ran those simulations on SU2 v6.0.0 and v4.3.0, both compiled on Linux. I got the same results in both cases; - ran the Onera M6 test case provided with SU2; - created the same mesh that I used for the EBW with my Gmsh script but around the Onera M6 (I just changed the height of the first cell which is smaller for the M6 than for my wing). I recovered the expected results. Finally, I also ran the case with the Euler equations, on the EBW meshed with Gmsh, and recovered the expected results. In summary, I have tried several meshes from different software, with different numerical parameters on different SU2 versions, but always got bad results when solving RANS equations.; Particularly, the Gmsh mesh preprocessing on SU2 gave a bad z-projection of the EBW.; However, the same meshes gave converged results on CFD++.

And indeed, when I checked the compiled SU2 bin, `SU2_MSH` seemed to be missing. Has this functionality been removed and is that why the python script is not in the compiled SU2 bin?. I found that some people have had success using the `feature_adap` branch instead but that is running on v7.0.3. I also tried compiling this version but there appears to be a `mesh_adaptation.py` and `mesh_adaptation_amg.py`. If one wants to use mesh adaptation, is this the recommended branch?.

Availability,"t involves installing the desired python version with `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install <version>`. To recap, a ""workflow for newbies"" which appears to be working for me is. 1. install pyenv either from [source](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) or from your distibution repositories, if available. IMPORTANT: make sure the environment variables are correctly set and `pyenv init` is added to your shell, as per the installation instructions.; 2. install the desired python version (for example 3.7.8), enabling shared libraries: ; `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install 3.7.8`; 3. clone/download the [feature_adap](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/feature_adap) branch of SU2;; 4. in the SU2 folder, configure meson ; `./meson.py build` ; and make sure to update the environment variables in your `.bashrc` as indicated by meson's output.; 5. use ninja to build and install SU2 ; `./ninja -C build install`;; if you run into a permission error, specify an installation directory passing the `--prefix` option to meson, as explained [here](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2-installation/227676-su-installation-failed-due-insufficient-permissions.html). These passages, at least for me, result in a running SU2 with mesh adaptation, although I have made no tests on running actual simulations. That being said, the involvement of pyenv is due to the fact that the provided python wheel for pyamg is for python 3.7 only. If I understand correctly, the library itself is proprietary, sadly, so I assume @bmunguia has access either to the source files or to someone who can package them. Depending on the actual compatibility of the code, it would be nice if the wheel was updated to the latest python version, or at least the dependency on 3.7.* was removed. . @chesiv you can also try checking the logs in the `log.err` and `log.out` files to see if anything has gone wrong.

Availability,"t normal (and a tangent to this normal) the current implementation of BC_Sym cannot be ""exploited"" to serve as an ""inviscid (slip) wall"" for non-straight markers. Using `MARKER_EULER= ( sym )` is not correct either as the gradients of the velocity components (used in the viscous stress tensor of the momentum equations) are not computed correctly for the reflected state. Although using MARKER_EULER in the current develop will give you the same results as the master (or older develop before #657 ) with MARKER_SYM (... as it uses the same implementation). If you pull the ""Preprocessing"" part from the develop Sym_BC into the loop over all vertices of the boundary marker, the unit normal (and tangential) gets recomputed for each vertex. That gives you results which should be a lot closer to what happens in the master. Plus handling the velocity gradient correctly. From my point of view this would be the correct way.; Apply this patch in the root of the latest develop code using `patch -p1 < SymAsInviscidSlipWall.diff` to get the code I mean. [SymAsInviscidSlipWall.diff.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/3417354/SymAsInviscidSlipWall.diff.txt). The implementation of the Symmetry_BC could serve double as 'Inviscid (slip) wall' (which is prescribed in the NASA documents) for viscous flow if the 'Preprocessing' part gets recomputed for each boundary vertex. But how to integrate that best is s.th. to discuss. One could just pull it in at some higher computational cost, put a conditional together with a boolean (e.g. SYMMETRY_AS_SLIP_WALL= YES) or fixing and using MARKER_EULER for that case. I hope that clarifies what happens with that boundary. Please let me know if that works for you and fixes the issue. When I fixed the Regression Testcases for #657 i think that this one was not part of it, right? Maybe this validation case goes into the su2code/VandV repo :) . Cheers,Tobi.

Availability,"t trickier: the latest 2D results of @RoccoBombardieri show pretty much no difference including the first timesteps. The onera m6 case in contrast converges to the same (steady-state) results for both code version eventually but their initial transient phase differs quite significantly. . A possible explanation for the different initial transient phase: In both implementations a ""reflected state"" is constructed where the normal component of the velocity is subtracted [once in the older code version & twice in the newer version]. I.e. subtracting the normal component of velocity twice means mirroring the velocity along the symmetry plane. The newer code version is a bit ""stronger"" in enforcing the boundary conditions which could lead to the reduced oscillation in CD and CL. If we agree that both code versions produce physically correct results for steady cases and unsteady cases that were integrated long enough in time to get rid of the influence of the initial condition ... then we are left with this initial transient phase that differs. Of course if there is more evidence that one or the other version produces physically ""better"" results I would love to see that. Until then, both initial oscillations are equally correct/uncorrect in my opinion. [I'll add a few words about the adjoint here later]. [I'll add the idea of an FSI case of @cvencro here later where the initial phase has a major impact]; Consider an FSI computation of an airfoil where the trailing edge can exhibit flutter (periodic up-and-down-movement of the trailing edge) in certain flow regimes. Now if during the initial transient the forces on the airfoil are higher than in the converged state then the fluttering can be excited where the initial transient can be seen as an activation energy. If you were to e.g. ramp up flow speed/conditions slowly up to the same magnitude as before one might end up without fluttering. So based on the flow history there might exist multiple ""stable"" states.

Availability,"ted to a problem? Please describe.**; Under the User's Guide, there are no direct explanations of the different slope limiters available to the user, or what solvers they apply to. I think that information on this topic in the documentation would be extremely helpful to a new user in understanding the differences between the available limiters and their respective strengths/weaknesses. There exists an [open pull request](https://github.com/su2code/su2code.github.io/pull/83/commits/4dcff98256e61d9d478e5af677859cbcfc6c80f1) within the documentation repo that starts this idea. However, it is incomplete and contains very little new information. . **Describe the solution you'd like**; We would like to contribute more to this idea. Specifically, we would like to add. - A description of why slope limiters are used in a FVM formulation. This can explain the concept of Total Variation Diminishing methods, monotonic schemes, and 2nd order accuracy requirements. ; - Mathematically describe the limiters available to the user in SU2. This will include a brief discussion of their properties (e.g., diffusivity, tunable parameters) and potential Sweby plots. ; - An empirical comparison of the available limiters on a test problem(s). One problem that was considered was the laminar cylinder, or the viscous wedge cases. The flowfield colored by the limiter value can be shown to the user. . **Describe alternatives you've considered**; N/A. **Additional context**; This issue ticket is part of an open-source community contribution assignment in our graduate studies ""Numerical Solutions to Partial Differential Equations"".

I don't know how to replicate this issue since I don't have a mac; do you have any suggestion? Maybe, Sravya, can we have a look together ( as you have a Mac :) ) so that we can find a solution also for other parts of the code for harmonic balance, not in the develop (eg spectral interpolation,...) ?

Availability,"this is a very nice contribution.. we’re working on the regressions and will pull this in once we have everything straightened out (and this branch passes). In the meantime, you got me thinking: the scale, rotate, translate options might be confusing now if a user doesn’t know whether to include the markers or not. Perhaps this is a chance for separating some of the “design” options from “mesh” options. One way I could see us do this is by moving the implementation I had just committed for the “volume” scale, rotate, and translate options over into the SU2_MSH executable, which might be a more logical home for it. However, this would require adding an extra set of config options for reading in a scale/rotate/translate options for SU2_MSH. The nice thing here is that we keep the intent separate, i.e., only design variables are listed with the other design variables while the mesh transformations are elsewhere. A different, possibly simpler way would be to just create separate names for these two types in the list of available options so that there is no ambiguity. Any thoughts?.

Availability,"to be bandwidth-bound, vectorization helps a bit there too (instructions are also data that needs to travel to the CPU) (maybe for explicit schemes and 8 SIMD lanes, maybe). **Relation with data structures**; There is only one efficient way to move data between memory and registers, via `load` and `store` instructions (they do come in multiple flavors). That is, pointing to a memory location and reading or writing N elements of contiguous data.; It is not the only way, it is also possible to `gather` and `scatter` data. That is populating the register from non-contiguous locations and vice versa. This is about one order of magnitude slower, to the point where if the computations are very simple it may not pay-off to vectorize. **Relation with algorithms**; Some form of `gather` and `scatter` is required in unstructured CFD, which means SIMD has a price of admission. Some thought needs to go into designing algorithms that amortize that cost by maximizing the so called FLOP/Byte ratio, and mask the latency of those operations by being able to start computing as soon as the first element of data is available. **What elements should we try to process simultaneously?**; The choice is between multiple geometric primitives (edges/points) or multiple solution primitives (variables). The latter sounds like a sensible idea until we get to areas of the code where different primitives require different treatment, that and the fact that the number of variables might not fit evenly in the number of lanes can lead to very tricky and non-generic code. Nevertheless if the same code were to be applied to e.g. 4 solution variables, this strategy would likely perform better as it avoids the pesky gather/scatter operations.; Processing multiple geometric primitives can make full utilization of whatever register size (important on GPU's), the code is just as readable (as I hope to show), but gather/scatter cannot be avoided. ### Intro to SPMD; This one is simpler, in a nutshell multiple t",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-529662724:1923,mask,mask,1923,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-529662724,4,"['avail', 'mask']","['available', 'mask']"
Availability,"to preserve spatial locality (this aspect is absolutely fundamental).; - Matrix multiplication, BCSR format is also embarrassing parallel.; - Linear preconditioners, additive decomposition within each MPI rank over a number of threads that need not be the same as that used for other areas. **SIMD**; - For gradients, limiters, and numerics a SIMD-friendly type will be used, by and large the high level code will look the same (see my examples above) but multiple points/edges will be processed simultaneously.; - No changes will be required to the data layout of CVariable, which means there will be no penalty to scalar code, new overloads for accessor methods will be required to set/get SIMD-arrays of data instead of scalars.; - The geometric properties and graph information associated with CGeometry will require the same contiguous storage treatment received by CVariable.; - Linear algebra, dimension-specific multiplication kernels with manual low level optimisations (unrolling, vectorization through intrinsics, and software prefetching), complex code but encapsulated in a low maintenance area of the code. **General improvements**; - Fusing convective and viscous residual loops, this will NOT be done by super gluing convective and viscous numerics. I do not have a concrete design in mind yet but I hope to be able to do something akin to the *decorator* pattern I mentioned before. I also plan to make the numerics a full-fledged *visitor* to reduce compilation dependencies, currently a change to numerics may affect CVariable CSolver and CNumerics (as mentioned by @clarkpede), CSolver is involved because it is responsible for fetching data, I may move that to CNumerics, which would let them fetch data as needed.; - Lookup accesses to CSysMatrix to avoid linear searches, the small increase in memory usage can be mitigated by sharing these lookup tables/arrays and the sparsity pattern between matrices associated with the same geometry (on the subject of these lookup tables, ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-539523312:2900,mainten,maintenance,2900,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-539523312,1,['mainten'],['maintenance']

Some steps that I have done:; ### CNEMOEulerVariable.cpp ; * Removed constant calculations inside a for loop; * Passed the Solution_Old = Solution to outside the loop. ### CNEMOEulerSolver.cpp; * Removed the ""for"" loop that fills the Nodes Primitive Fields (already done in the Preprocessing phase); * Removed the error counter (already done in the Preprocessing phase). ### CSolverFactory.cpp; * Removed the Preprocessing step after the CNEMOEulerSolver instantiation (**This is done before the start of the iterative process, regardless. Additionally, the Navier-Stokes do not have any preprocess phase after the instantiation, why is that ?** ).

Availability,"u have God-classes and ""do-it-all"" functions. The hope is that refactoring these classes will lead to more modular and easier-to-maintain code. ### Decision to use Catch2. Catch2 was chosen for the unit testing library for the following reasons:. + It can be included as a header-only library.; + It has a very clean, easy-to-use syntax; + It has widespread use, including the FEniCS library. ### Design choices. The following design choices are in place. If you disagree with them, then please start a discussion here:. + All tests are placed in a root-level directory named `UnitTests`. Inside this directory is a structure just like the existing folder structure (e.g. `SU2_CFD/numerics`), except that there are not separate `src` and `include` folders.; + Tests are grouped by class, and put in files such as `CNumerics_tests.cpp`.; + A single test executable is compiled and run, as opposed to a separate test executable for each group of tests. With the single test executable, you can always filter down to groups of tests or individual tests.; + When `ninja test` or `meson test` is run, the test executable is only run once, sweeping through all the unit tests. The result only shows a single failure or a single success. If more detail is desired, then the test executable can be run manually.; + The relevant SU2 code is compiled as a library (e.g. `libSU2core`) and then linked into both the main executable (`SU2_CFD`) and the test program (`test_driver`). ### How to Run Unit Tests. If you compile SU2 using `ninja -C builddir`, then the test executable will automatically be compiled. You then have three options for running the tests:. + `meson test` (see documentation [here](https://mesonbuild.com/Unit-tests.html)); + `ninja test`; + Run the exectuable manually: `./UnitTests/test_driver`. When running the executable manually, there are many customization options. Run `./UnitTests/test_driver --help` to see them all. ### How to add unit tests.

Availability,"ython functions that take in a set of FFD points and aggregate their movement in the desired way. All this can be done without any incision into the C++ code, given a python interface that can provide the C++ code the final FFD point locations and letting it do the deformation. . Moving functionality to python could also remove the need for some of the other SU2 modules that haven't been updated for a while. For example, SU2_GEO is a bloated wrapper c++ script that calls a couple of CGeometry/CSurfaceMovement functions. The calling of these functions could be easily ported to python and increase the functionality of the Python Wrapper interface. . Some of the specific things I want to do in this PR:. 1. Refactor SU2_GEO such that all its functionality can be performed in python (in progress); 2. Add a generalized thickness constraint (in progress); 3. Be able to do multiple types of geometry evaluation (for example wing+fuselage); 4. Expose some of the mesh deformation functions to python to allow for robust design variable definition; 5. Perform all of the shape optimization using the in-memory python scripts; 6. Intelligent handling of solution divergences that doesn't break the optimization; 7. Better way to define multipoint optimizations; 8. Better multi-objective optimization definition (#913 might be helpful in this); 9. Simplify the multitude of shape optimization options (#733). As you can probably tell, a lot of my examples and motivations revolve around aerospace applications. So while I try and make a general framework that is robust, I might not be thinking in a broad enough fashion. I would love to get input from the community for any functionality that they might want to see in this framework. The more robust this is, the more widely useful it will be. I am also a newbie to the python wrapper world of SU2.

Convergence history is non deterministic when using the NEWTON_KRYLOV solver using OMP-only parallelism. When fixing the min RMS residual, the computation stops at a different iteration each time I run the solver.; That happens with the EULER or NAVIER_STOKES and RANS solvers.

Tried also switching ON and OFF the CFL adaptation and limiters, different linear solvers, and precision (single/double) of the linear solver but that doesn't change the outcome of the test (RANS conv history remains non deterministic while EULER and NS have always the same convergence history).

Availability,"👍 for doing this @maxaehle . ; - I am in favor of removing the `_ADJ_` options with the `GRAD_OBJFUNC_FILENAME`.; - As Roe is used the `JST_SENSOR_COEFF` can go. Limiter are turned off so either the slope limiter section with 2 options can be removed or be moved down below the `FLOW NUMERICAL METHOD DEFNITION`.; - `CONV_CRITERIA` will be gone once you merge develop and you can add `CONV_FIELD=RMS_DENSITY` as that is also the default. Removign the `_CAUCHY_` options is prob debatable, but in this very cfg they are unused. ; - The `CFL_ADAPT*` stuff can go (unless the values are chosen in such a way by you that they do work well, otherwise it might even do negative advertisement for an option). I guess I am also a bit aggressive on stripping options from files, so take it with a grain of salt 🧂 . Another aspect ,which is of course nothing to be changed in this PR and is also a bit off-topic, is that lists like `SOLVER` change over time but the list in the comment over the option in the Testcase cfg does not get updated (there might of course be good examples of people doing so ;) ). `WAVE_EQUATION` and `POISSON_EQUATION` e.g. are not available anymore, yet they are in the cfg description of `SOLVER` here... and 200 other Testcases.

Deployability," (should be your 3.7.8) and try `import pyamg` in the shell. If the ""No such file or directory"" error shows up, it means pyamg was not correctly installed; otherwise it is in fact installed. In the latter case, you can check if your python is configured to enable shared libraries. To do it, according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23201498/how-to-check-if-python3-was-built-with-enable-shared), in the python shell you can type ; `import sysconfig`; `sysconfig.get_config_vars('Py_ENABLE_SHARED')`; If the result is `[0]`, ie ""False"", you have to build python with the option `--enable-shared`. ; Now, I don't know how to do accomplish that with conda, but with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) it involves installing the desired python version with `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install <version>`. To recap, a ""workflow for newbies"" which appears to be working for me is. 1. install pyenv either from [source](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) or from your distibution repositories, if available. IMPORTANT: make sure the environment variables are correctly set and `pyenv init` is added to your shell, as per the installation instructions.; 2. install the desired python version (for example 3.7.8), enabling shared libraries: ; `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install 3.7.8`; 3. clone/download the [feature_adap](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/feature_adap) branch of SU2;; 4. in the SU2 folder, configure meson ; `./meson.py build` ; and make sure to update the environment variables in your `.bashrc` as indicated by meson's output.; 5. use ninja to build and install SU2 ; `./ninja -C build install`;; if you run into a permission error, specify an installation directory passing the `--prefix` option to meson, as explained [here](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2-installation/227676-su-installation-failed-due-insufficient-permissions.html).

Deployability," PR:. 1. Refactor SU2_GEO such that all its functionality can be performed in python (in progress); 2. Add a generalized thickness constraint (in progress); 3. Be able to do multiple types of geometry evaluation (for example wing+fuselage); 4. Expose some of the mesh deformation functions to python to allow for robust design variable definition; 5. Perform all of the shape optimization using the in-memory python scripts; 6. Intelligent handling of solution divergences that doesn't break the optimization; 7. Better way to define multipoint optimizations; 8. Better multi-objective optimization definition (#913 might be helpful in this); 9. Simplify the multitude of shape optimization options (#733). As you can probably tell, a lot of my examples and motivations revolve around aerospace applications. So while I try and make a general framework that is robust, I might not be thinking in a broad enough fashion. I would love to get input from the community for any functionality that they might want to see in this framework. The more robust this is, the more widely useful it will be. I am also a newbie to the python wrapper world of SU2.

Deployability," aerodynamic shape and structural sizing optimization using dedicated frameworks (e.g. OpenMDAO). . Startup development costs include the creation of modular tools that are _designed to be driven_ by another framework like OpenMDAO, rather than _to drive execution_ themselves. However, leveraging those MDAO frameworks assumes that software codes and modules to be coupled exist, have appropriate data structures, execution and query APIs, and are wrapped in Python for flexibility and ease of use. The proposed changes were motivated with the goal of making SU2 more modular and flexible, particularly to facilitate its integration into large-scale MDAO frameworks. For more details on the motivation, methodology, and verification & validation results, please refer to our [paper from AIAA Aviation 2022](https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-3358). . ## Proposed Changes; @aa-g and I propose the following code updates:. 1. Implementation of residual-based discrete adjoint solver as `CDiscAdjResidualSolver`; a. New config option: `KIND_DISC_ADJ` . 2. Enhancements and standardization of SU2 Python API; a. Add pysu2/pysu2ad methods; b. Standardize Python API and function names ; c. Overloaded getter/setter methods to make data handling more flexible. ## Related Work; These efforts are related to Issue #1262, Pull Request #1300, and Discussion [#1325](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/discussions/1325). . ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [ ] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with --warnlevel=3 when using meson).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style (https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Style-Guide/).; - [X] I used the pre-commit hook to prevent dirty commits and used pre-commit run --all to format old commits.; - [ ] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.; - [ ] I have updated appropriate documentation (Tutorials, Docs Page, config_template.cpp), if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1750:2437,update,updated,2437,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1750,1,['update'],['updated']
Deployability," and boostconv algorithm as proposed by [2]. _SFD_: A method, enabling the computation of steady solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in globally unstable configurations. Steady-state is achieved by damping the unstable temporal frequencies with addition of a dissipative relaxation term proportional to the high-frequency content of the velocity fluctuations. [1]. _boostconv_: An iterative algorithm, inspired by Krylov-subspace methods, which is able to compute unstable steady states and/or accelerate the convergence to stable configurations. This algorithm is based on the minimization of the residual norm at each iteration step with a projection basis updated at each iteration rather than at periodic restarts like in the classical GMRES method. The algorithm is able to stabilize any dynamical system without increasing the computational time of the original numerical procedure used to solve the governing equations. _Moreover, it can be easily inserted into a pre-existing relaxation (integration) procedure with a call to a single black-box subroutine_. [2]. **Additional context**; I would be happy to collaborate on implementation of said algorithms in SU2 but I do not have much experience with C++ (I mostly use Fortran) and I am not too familiar with SU2 source code so it would be great to work with someone more experienced in those areas.

To do it, according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23201498/how-to-check-if-python3-was-built-with-enable-shared), in the python shell you can type ; `import sysconfig`; `sysconfig.get_config_vars('Py_ENABLE_SHARED')`; If the result is `[0]`, ie ""False"", you have to build python with the option `--enable-shared`. ; Now, I don't know how to do accomplish that with conda, but with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) it involves installing the desired python version with `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install <version>`. To recap, a ""workflow for newbies"" which appears to be working for me is. 1. install pyenv either from [source](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) or from your distibution repositories, if available. IMPORTANT: make sure the environment variables are correctly set and `pyenv init` is added to your shell, as per the installation instructions.; 2. install the desired python version (for example 3.7.8), enabling shared libraries: ; `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install 3.7.8`; 3. clone/download the [feature_adap](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/feature_adap) branch of SU2;; 4. in the SU2 folder, configure meson ; `./meson.py build` ; and make sure to update the environment variables in your `.bashrc` as indicated by meson's output.; 5. use ninja to build and install SU2 ; `./ninja -C build install`;; if you run into a permission error, specify an installation directory passing the `--prefix` option to meson, as explained [here](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2-installation/227676-su-installation-failed-due-insufficient-permissions.html). These passages, at least for me, result in a running SU2 with mesh adaptation, although I have made no tests on running actual simulations.

Update, 13.04.2023: The combination of grid velocities from the moving + deforming grid turned out to be more complicated as expected (at least for me) and the moving grid is not fully implemented for unsteady simulations (according to Pedro, some source terms are missing). The new approach uses a farfield onflow condition at alpha=0.0 and translates and rotates the whole aircraft in the elastic mesh for the rigid body + structural dynamic reaction. This is more laborious on my side (transformation of the surface, the deformation vector and the forces about the Euler angles) but simplifies the work on the SU2 side:. - extend the gust to 3D meshes (current implementation only for 2D meshes); - ~~update the grid movement during the time domain simulation via the python interface; Involved parameters: ; GRID_MOVEMENT= ROTATING_FRAME; TRANSLATION_RATE= u v w ; ROTATION_RATE= p q r~~; - update the surface mesh deformation during the time domain simulation via the python interface ; Involved parameters: ; DEFORM_MESH= YES; MARKER_DEFORM_MESH= ( list of markers ).

Deployability," from python and we can easily ship it (as a submodule) since it needs no installation/compilation. . ### What is ninja ?; ninja is a replacement for make and is used to execute the compiler and to resolve dependencies. Meson uses ninja as the default backend. So instead of using configure + make, we use meson + ninja. As with meson, we can ship it as a submodule. It needs a compilation, but again it has no dependencies apart from python. ### How to use ?; The correct meson and ninja versions are added as git submodules. So in case you don't have meson and ninja installed (there should be packages available for all major distros), compile ninja using:. ```; cd externals/ninja; ./configure.py --bootstrap; cd ..; export PATH=$PWD/externals/ninja:$PWD/externals/meson:$PATH; ```; and run meson using; ```; meson.py build --prefix=$PWD -Denable-pywrapper=true -Denable-autodiff=true; ```; to ocnfigure SU2 with the python wrapper and AD support enabled. MPI support will be enabled by default if a proper mpi installation can be found. ; Finally compile the code with; ```; ninja -C build; ```. - ""build"" in the commands above is a folder where the configuration will be stored. You can configure multiple directories with different configurations (like for a debug build etc); - ninja uses all available cores in your system by default. Still you can set the number of jobs using `-j N`. ### Additional notes; - Meson requires python 3, so implicitly we get this requirement now. But I think it is less of a problem than some of you probably might think. A lot of problems we have come from the fact the we support python 2 and python 3. As I was setting up travis (getting there in a moment) I noticed that is easily possible to compile the code with python 3 (for the python wrapper) and run the python scripts with python 2 and vice versa, which eventually leads to errors and crashes.

Deployability," gradients computes a reinterpretation of the gradient in a different Hilbert space, [see this short overview.](http://www.cse.unt.edu/~renka/papers/sobolev.pdf); This is done by solving an elliptic PDE with the sensitivities, i.e., ( e1 Id - e2 Laplace) delta_x = - dF / dx, with different weights e1, e2. Inserting the sensitivities from the discrete adjoint solver for (dF / dx) leads to the gradient in a Sobolev space.; The method can be extended to incorporate the parameterization of the mesh cells x=M(p) with design values p, [see here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15279) Using the projected gradient w.r.t. the design values the systems takes the form; (dM/dp)^T (e1 Id - e2 Laplace) (dM/dp) = - dF/dp. Such treatment can help prevent noise in the derivative computation and leads to smoother design updates. Especially, when working in a One-Shot optimization context.; Here the optimization is done with inexact function values and gradients, i.e., the flow and adjoint solvers are only partially converged between design updates. For this setting simple gradient descent with too large update steps will not work, since a few flow iterations are not enough to recover a solution from the restart file from the last optimization step.; See the graphic below for drag minimization of a NACA 0012 airfoil with constant lift, where the Sobolev solver for the gradient leads to smoother deformations and better optimization.; ![pullrequest1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16785869/143250126-e5bdd360-e265-40ca-9d24-5811ecbb759c.jpg). Application is done as a post-processing step in the SU2_DOT_AD executable.; The new solver constructs the necessary operator and solves it using the features of the finite element implementation in SU2. For this, it uses the same elements as the FEA solver but extends the definitions of the Gauss quadrature to be second order.; It can operate in two different modes:. 1) The smoothing can be applied to the mesh sensitivities, either in the com",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1446:1199,update,updates,1199,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1446,1,['update'],['updates']

This has been implemented in analogy to the strong boundary conditions. The correction can be activated like this:. TURB_FIXED_VALUES= YES; TURB_FIXED_VALUES_DOMAIN= -1.0. The second parameter specifies the half-plane on which fixed values are applied. This half-plane consists of those points for which the dot product of their coordinate vector with the normalized far-field velocity vector is less than `TURB_FIXED_VALUES_DOMAIN`. .

Deployability," per rank participates in the message passing, I have no experience here though so this might be a bad strategy, idk. **Back to business:**; I went silent for a bit because in prototyping a typical residual computation and matrix update loop I made some realisations that made me go back to the drawing board regarding data structures, and eventually back to square 0. . ## Parallel strategy for flux computation; Because significant computation is required to obtain each edge's flux, it does not make sense to attempt a ""point-loop"" strategy (which would double the effort).; However, one can either use colouring to avoid the race conditions that would result from updating the residual of cells i and j, or store the edge fluxes and then, on a second point-loop perform the summation of fluxes for each cell, with the direction being accounted by the same adjacency information used in the point-loop GG gradient computation.; If we consider only the update of residuals the two strategies are fairly equivalent performance wise, the tie breaker is the matrix updates. ## Matrix Updates; By this I mean the `addBlock`, `subBlock` we do (two times each) to update diagonal and off-diagonal blocks for each edge.; Here is a dummy numerics loop that does nothing else but setting blocks in the matrix (with colouring).; ```c++; void testLoop1(const vector<size_t>& colorStart,; const vector<size_t>& edgeIdx,; const vector<pair<size_t,size_t> >& connectivity,; double** blk_i, double** blk_j,; SparseMatrix& matrix); {; matrix.setZero();. for(size_t color=0; color<colorStart.size()-1; ++color); #pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic,CHUNK_SIZE); for(size_t k=colorStart[color]; k<colorStart[color+1]; ++k); {; size_t iEdge = edgeIdx[k];; size_t iPoint = connectivity[iEdge].first;; size_t jPoint = connectivity[iEdge].second;. matrix.addBlock(iPoint, iPoint, blk_i);; matrix.addBlock(iPoint, jPoint, blk_j);. matrix.subBlock(jPoint, jPoint, blk_j);; matrix.subBlock(jPoint, iPoint, blk_i);; }; }",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-535977206:1160,update,update,1160,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-535977206,4,['update'],"['update', 'updates']"
Deployability," performed. Presently, there is no compressible open-source CFD code capable of supersonic simulations, as far as I know, able to obtain ''unstable'' steady-states. The solutions outlined below not only would give the users capabilities needed to perform stability analysis of globally unstable flows with help of SU2 code but would also provide means of accelerating convergence of any unsteady solution. **Describe the solution you'd like**; Implementation of selective frequency damping (SFD) for unsteady simulation as introduced in [1] and boostconv algorithm as proposed by [2]. _SFD_: A method, enabling the computation of steady solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in globally unstable configurations. Steady-state is achieved by damping the unstable temporal frequencies with addition of a dissipative relaxation term proportional to the high-frequency content of the velocity fluctuations. [1]. _boostconv_: An iterative algorithm, inspired by Krylov-subspace methods, which is able to compute unstable steady states and/or accelerate the convergence to stable configurations. This algorithm is based on the minimization of the residual norm at each iteration step with a projection basis updated at each iteration rather than at periodic restarts like in the classical GMRES method. The algorithm is able to stabilize any dynamical system without increasing the computational time of the original numerical procedure used to solve the governing equations. _Moreover, it can be easily inserted into a pre-existing relaxation (integration) procedure with a call to a single black-box subroutine_. [2]. **Additional context**; I would be happy to collaborate on implementation of said algorithms in SU2 but I do not have much experience with C++ (I mostly use Fortran) and I am not too familiar with SU2 source code so it would be great to work with someone more experienced in those areas.

Deployability," revision e6e6e6b are very small, aside from an extra test file. But revision d1e3a18 fails the regression tests and revision e6e6e6b passes the regression tests. Specifically, it's only the CHT incompressible case that's failing. The test results show:. test_vals (stored): 0.000000, 0.000000, -7.685301, -12947.783696; sim_vals (computed): 0.000000, 0.000000, -7.685301, -12947.783678 ; delta_vals: 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000018. It's only the total heat flux that's different, and it's only off by 1E-7%. I believe that these changes are due to floating-point errors. To check and make sure nothing is going crazy, I ran the test case under both the develop and the PR branches. When I compared the solution files, I couldn't find any points where the solution differed by more than 0.0003%. The differences seem to be very small. The two differences between revision d1e3a18 and revision e6e6e6b can be summarized as follows:. 1. In the `CNumerics::GetViscousIncProjJacs()` calculation on the develop branch, a quantity called `theta` is calculated. `theta` is the magnitude of the `val_normal` parameter, squared. The catch is that `val_normal` is passed as a unit vector (named `UnitNormal` in `CAvgGradInc_Flow::ComputeResidual`). So `theta` should always be equal to one, with some floating point errors. In the failing revision, the value is set explicitly to one. In the passing revision, the magnitude is calculated explicitly. I checked, and the difference between `theta` and 1.0 is always of the order 1E-16 or less.; 2. The second change affects where the area is multiplied into the Jacobian. When the area is multiplied at a later stage, very small differences in the calculated quantities appear. I don't like revision e6e6e6b, and I would like to revert it. The question then is how to update the tests. We could just update the regression test values, but I would propose fixing the regression test. It seems to be sensitive to what I believe are unimportant differences.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/626#issuecomment-444655022:2009,update,update,2009,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/626#issuecomment-444655022,2,['update'],['update']
Deployability," rough wall, the WALL_TYPE option must specified for all the markers and WALL_ROUGHNESS set to 0.0 for smooth walls and the desired value for rough walls. ; [Sample input file for airfoil with smooth and rough walls](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/4198580/turb_naca62215_v7cfg.txt). The airfoil used here is the NACA 622215 and I can send the mesh and experimental data in case anyone is interested. . ## Additional notes. Modification of wall distance computation required some changes to the ADT routines and subsequently to some FEM stuff as well. To modify the wall distance with roughness, I needed to know which marker was the closest wall and add the corresponding roughness. However, I wasn't sure how to properly do this in MPI. My solution was to pass the marker roughness information to the ADT class itself. This meant I had to add a dummy argument whenever the corresponding ADT classes were called elsewhere. Just to clarify, the modification is only in CADTElem class constructor and ComputeWallDistance routines. I hope this will not be a problem. I made this as a draft PR in case there are some issues with this. Also, if there are any issues with how the config file is changed, I can update that as well. I haven't modified the config_template for this yet. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply. You can fill this out after submitting the PR. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!

Deployability," scheme for a multi-physics problem. To obtain the design accuracy in time, this implies that the loop over the number of time stages is outside the loop over the number of physical disciplines. Hence at a very high level in the hierarchy, the details of the time integration should then be known. The situation becomes even more complicated when one would like to employ time integration schemes that allow for time accurate local time stepping, e.g. the ones we are currently working on for the DG solver. I won't bore you with all the details here, but those schemes basically require the loop over the multiple disciplines to be between the predictor and corrector step, while both these steps consist of multiple stages. Although it is probably possible to come up with a data structure that supports all this, the question is whether this is desirable. Apart from the fact that it would require a major overhaul in the high level design of SU2, the implementation will be less readable, especially for people that will be starting with the code. Also the parallelization may become significantly more complicated. The alternative is that for unsteady multi-physics problems, we put the restriction that only single stage time integration schemes can be used, e.g. DT_STEPPING_1ST and DT_STEPPING_2ND. In that case, the details of the time integration scheme can be hidden at the driver level, where we then simply have a loop over the number of physical disciplines. The consequence of course is that more advanced time integration schemes will not be available for multi-physics problems. In the above I just tried to picture what, in my opinion, the consequences are for either option. I don't have a preference for one of them. The only thing I wanted to make clear is that it is not possible to hide all the details of the time integration scheme at the driver level, while also having support for all possible time integration schemes for an unsteady multi-physics problem.

Deployability," that the Prism and Pyramid shape elements used for mesh deformation had some issues, namely:; - The Prism (6 nodes) element had incorrect integration points, and perhaps due to some inconsistency between the ordering of the nodes and the shape function it had ""negative"" stiffness (deform opposite to force). The latter issue was remedied by using negative weights... I tried permuting the integration points but that did not help.; - The Pyramid (5 nodes) had inconsistent integration points and shape functions, it was using pyramid points but degenerate hex functions, this made the element some 20 times more flexible than it should be, pyramid shape functions are used now. My main reason to look into this was to support all element types in the structural solver both for linear and nonlinear analysis, in principle that should be working now, but I still have tests to run. I took the opportunity to refactor the CElement family of classes, now the derived classes only deal with the shape specifics:; - Integration/extrapolation points, shape function and derivatives, are computed and stored at construction.; - Area/Volume computation in undeformed (reference) or deformed (current) coordinates. Generic actions like allocating data and computing gradients are done by the base class. For the latter I included one method for 2D and another for 3D, they only differ in the inversion of the Jacobian but being specialized nDim can be ""hardcoded"" which should allow for more compile time optimization. I expect some regressions to fail, and I will still run more tests to verify the revised elements. I will post those results and add a regression. ## PR Checklist. - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [X] I have added a test case that demonstrates my c",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/681:1086,Integrat,Integration,1086,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/681,1,['Integrat'],['Integration']

Deployability," the features of the finite element implementation in SU2. For this, it uses the same elements as the FEA solver but extends the definitions of the Gauss quadrature to be second order.; It can operate in two different modes:. 1) The smoothing can be applied to the mesh sensitivities, either in the complete mesh or only design boundaries. See the picture below for an example of this.; ![PicforSU2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16785869/149150313-a996ecba-fe7f-4de7-983e-560410b840b4.jpeg). 2) It also includes the possibility to take the mesh parameterization into account, compute the derivatives (dM/dp), and smooth the sensitivities w.r.t. the design parameters. This is done by the same AD logic used in SU2_DOT.cpp::SetProjection_AD. The routines are extended, such that AD can compute arbitrary matrix-vector products with the Jacobian of the parameterization and apply the smoothing operator to the gradient. This is a continuation of draft #1439 with a new rebased branch. It has a cleaner commit history and not so much legacy from previous versions.

Deployability," the parameter MATH_PROBLEM from DIRECT to CONTINUOUS_ADJOINT in the configuration file and:. $ ln -s restart_flow.dat solution_flow.dat; $ SU2_CFD inv_adj_NACA0012.cfg. I obtained a correct adjoint solution (density adjoint field visualized with ParaView from 'adjoint.vtu' looks reasonably similar to the image shown in the tutorial). Finally, I wanted to also try the algorithmic differentiation, so I changed the parameter MATH_PROBLEM to DISCRETE_ADJOINT in the configuration file and:. $ SU2_CFD_AD inv_dadj_NACA0012.cfg. I failed to obtain a correct adjoint solution (I expected to see something really similar to what I got with the CONTINUOUS_ADJOINT method): the density adjoint field seems to have a completely different scale (instead of having values in the approximate range -200 ÷ +200, it has values in the range -0.264 ÷ +0.217 and the values not too close to zero are concentrated in an area near the farfield boundary, far from the airfoil).

Deployability," to compute the mesh deformation. The adjoint sensitivities can now be propagated down to the surface mesh points without the need to use DOT, although further work is needed to propagate them to the FFD points or other DV of choice. I tried to keep config options simple: the new mesh solver is enabled using; ` DEFORM_MESH = YES `; and the relevant markers which will move and introduce deformations into the domain are set using; `MARKER_DEFORM_MESH= ( wall )`; Hopefully, previous mesh deformation structures can be deprecated and removed soon, but we will need to adapt the rigid/imposed boundary deformation of other kinds of grid movement. I kindly ask for your help in there, as I'm not very familiar with some of the legacy code for this purpose. Additionally, in this PR I have done some refactoring so the AD-based adjoint routines are accessible from the python-wrapped version of the code. The SWIG wrapper now compiles the AD binaries and interfaces directly to sensitivity information, which should make it much easier to integrate SU2 within any python-based optimization framework. . ## Related Work; - Some work will be needed to adapt the new contiguous variable structure by @pcarruscag in #753; - I have added a couple of regression tests, but I will add tutorials once #724 is merged. As of now, a bug reported in #713 prevents me from adding any meaningful tutorial - but that should be fixed in #724 according to @talbring ; - I already started adding the mesh solver, numerics and transfer functions in separate files as discussed in #583 and already started in #725. For clarity and ease of merging, only new classes are split so far, but I will probably start splitting other structures soon in PRs to come. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.
