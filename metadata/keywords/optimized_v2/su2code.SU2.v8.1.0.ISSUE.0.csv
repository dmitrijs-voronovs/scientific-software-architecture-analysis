It is important that the linear solve behaves well for each nonlinear iteration, so if this does not converge immediately, adjust the tolerance or number of linear iterations. Roe seems very stable, but some of the other upwind schemes or centered schemes may require improved Jacobian accuracy (to recover fast convergence) with:. ```; USE_ACCURATE_FLUX_JACOBIANS= YES; CENTRAL_JACOBIAN_FIX_FACTOR= 4.0; ```. ### RANS; Due to the segregated approach for the turbulence models, you have to be more conservative with the CFL adaption.

Most inviscid/laminar cases that I have tested so far converge to machine precision within a couple of hundred iterations. RANS cases within a few thousand. Ultra fine RANS meshes can still slow things down (MG could help there), but otherwise, speedups of an order of magnitude (or more) are possible for most problems. Experiment yourselves.. sometimes you can get even more performance, sometimes less, case depending. I could use help testing this one with your cases, since I think almost all regression tests will change. As a start, I have run all of the NASA TMR 2D bump-in-channel cases. Everything looks good with that (see figures). I have also checked that the inviscid and laminar MMS give 2nd-order accuracy properly. ![bump_cd_gridconv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4896083/64910870-09f36b00-d6d0-11e9-9e1c-553fd09b42c8.png); ![bump_cf_0p63_gridconv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4896083/64910871-09f36b00-d6d0-11e9-8148-f211260dbf8f.png); ![bump_cf_0p75_gridconv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4896083/64910872-09f36b00-d6d0-11e9-8772-6e26a8bd08b0.png); ![bump_cf_0p87_gridconv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4896083/64910873-0a8c0180-d6d0-11e9-8c61-208809ff64e0.png); ![b",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790:3063,down,down,3063,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790,1,['down'],['down']

Availability," I created a `multizone.cfg` that refers to `multizone-0.cfg`, `multizone-1.cfg` and joins the zones by a `MARKER_FLUID_INTERFACE`. The two `multizone-i.cfg`s are identical to the `singlezone.cfg` except that the mesh filename and markers we adapted again, and the `ITER=` option was removed. In `issue_complicated.zip`, filenames and cfg files are a bit different but the meshes are the same. Observed and expected behaviour; ===========================; I would expect that the two simulations give similar results. However, the singlezone setup converges while the multizone setup diverges (`SU2 has diverged (NaN detected).` or `SU2 has diverged (Residual > 10^20 detected).`). The same behaviour is observed for CFL=10 instead of 1000, and also for SA with CFL=10. I ran v7.2.0 (commit 3ec1c680) in serial (without MPI). I reported a similar problem some time ago in the developer meeting, with a ""chopped NACA 0012 airfoil"" testcase. For this issue we created this more basic example which seems to reproduce the error (although I am not completely sure). Typically we would see the `SU2 has diverged (Residual > 10^20 detected).` error. Differences between multizone/fluid-interface and singlezone/joined-meshes; =========================================================; We came up with the following differences:; - **Flux calculation across the interface**: The flux between neighbor cells `i`, `j`, one of which has `radius<4` and the other one has `radius>4`, is computed differently.; + In singlezone this is just an ordinary flux computation along an edge `i`-`j`, with `CSolver::Upwind_Residual` (, `Viscous_Residual`).; + In multizone this flux between two zones is computed by `CSolver::BC_Fluid_Interface`.

Availability," SU2 Conference, a run of the full tape reveals that a variable used in a preaccumulation output is not properly recorded. The variable is the `val` in the function `PassiveAssign` in `CSysMatrix.hpp` line 215. `FORCEINLINE static ScalarType PassiveAssign(const SrcType& val) {; return SU2_TYPE::GetValue(val);; }`. Following the call stack of the error reveals that the problem variables in `val` are the jacobian components calculated in the Roe and JST scheme (these are the two options I have tested). It is possible to resolve this error by simply moving the stopping of the preaccumulation region from before the call to `updateLinearSystem` in the `ComputeFlux` method of both these schemes, to after, as show below. `/*--- Update the vector and system matrix. ---*/. updateLinearSystem(iEdge, iPoint, jPoint, implicit, updateType,; updateMask, flux, jac_i, jac_j, vector, matrix);. /*--- Stop preaccumulation. ---*/. stopPreacc(flux);`. However, whilst this resolve the error in this location, the next error appears in the Giles boundary condition. Here the two jacobian components within the residual object are not recorded correctly in the preaccumulation output region also. This in `CEulerSolver.cpp:6556`. `/*--- Compute the residual using an upwind scheme ---*/; auto residual = conv_numerics->ComputeResidual(config);. /*--- Update residual value ---*/; LinSysRes.AddBlock(iPoint, residual);`. I have tried simpy adding these components as preacc outputs however they are SIMD arrays and the datatype cannot be converted using the existing implementation. .

The ILU is different from the one we have in that it is computed for the entire matrix and not just for the local matrices (i.e. it considers halos), it is not very fast though.; The three factorizations can be used as preconditioners via options PASTIX_ILU, PASTIX_LU, and PASTIX_LDLT. And the first two as solvers via options PASTIX_LU and PASTIX_LDLT (in which case you should use a preconditioner type that does not cause CSysMatrix to allocate extra memory (LU_SGS).; The reason LDLT and LU can also be used as preconditioners is that it is possible to set a factorization frequency (via PASTIX_FACTORIZATION_FREQUENCY) so that the factorizations are only computed every N iterations or only on the first call (frequency set to 0), this is very useful for non linear elasticity.; The fill-in for the ILU is set via PASTIX_FILL_LEVEL, I did not reuse the option we have again to keep CSysMatrix from allocating any more than it needs to.; By default the solvers run",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/771:1211,Avail,Available,1211,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/771,1,['Avail'],['Available']

Availability," instead of using configure + make, we use meson + ninja. As with meson, we can ship it as a submodule. It needs a compilation, but again it has no dependencies apart from python. ### How to use ?; The correct meson and ninja versions are added as git submodules. So in case you don't have meson and ninja installed (there should be packages available for all major distros), compile ninja using:. ```; cd externals/ninja; ./configure.py --bootstrap; cd ..; export PATH=$PWD/externals/ninja:$PWD/externals/meson:$PATH; ```; and run meson using; ```; meson.py build --prefix=$PWD -Denable-pywrapper=true -Denable-autodiff=true; ```; to ocnfigure SU2 with the python wrapper and AD support enabled. MPI support will be enabled by default if a proper mpi installation can be found. ; Finally compile the code with; ```; ninja -C build; ```. - ""build"" in the commands above is a folder where the configuration will be stored. You can configure multiple directories with different configurations (like for a debug build etc); - ninja uses all available cores in your system by default. Still you can set the number of jobs using `-j N`. ### Additional notes; - Meson requires python 3, so implicitly we get this requirement now. But I think it is less of a problem than some of you probably might think. A lot of problems we have come from the fact the we support python 2 and python 3. As I was setting up travis (getting there in a moment) I noticed that is easily possible to compile the code with python 3 (for the python wrapper) and run the python scripts with python 2 and vice versa, which eventually leads to errors and crashes. If we require(!) version 3 (which should be installed on all machines now ...) we can avoid such problems from the beginning. Furthermore, python 2 is deprecated anyway ... - I already changed travis to use the new build system.

Availability," tests, grouping tests into suites, and running checks. This choice was based on what is available in our development setup. We have integrated our unit tests into our Travis CI regression testing. Every time we push commits or submit a pull request, the unit tests are run and checked. ## What is my vision for unit testing in SU2?. I am *not* proposing that we start trying to get 100% code coverage with pre-existing code. That would not provide a good return on investment. Instead, I see people adding unit tests as they write new code and as they find bugs. For each new behavior added to SU2, tests are first added to document the related existing behavior. These tests serve to check that the existing behavior isn't damaged by the new code. Then new tests are added to prove that the new behavior is working correctly. For bug fixes, the process is simpler. A test is added to confirm that something is not behaving as expected. Then the code is fixed to make the test pass. ## What frameworks are available?. For a unit testing framework, here are the most popular options, with the following pros and cons:. #### Roll-your-own. + Requires no external dependencies; + The most flexible option; + Involves the most work to setup; + Will lack some of the more advances features of mature unit-testing frameworks. #### Boost Test. + Can be header only, statically linked, or dynamically linked; + If statically or dynamically linked, then Boost is not very lightweight; + Easy to add if you're already using Boost. #### Google Test. + Most common unit-testing framework; + Can be easily combined with Google's powerful GMock mocking library; + Compiling and linking can be somewhat painful. #### Catch2. + Used by FEniCS; + Makes unit tests easily readable with lots of syntactic sugar.; + Has a very simple syntax; + Is header-only; + ~~Requires C++11 compilation~~ Requires C++11 for full feature set, but offers a C++03 branch; + Not as feature rich as Google Test or Boost Test. ## Question",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/698:3448,avail,available,3448,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/698,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability," to this pull request. ## Short history summary; Originally the idea behind such an approach is given by @clarkpede in [here](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/992#issuecomment-652446915).; The code implementation was suggested by @pcarruscag in [here](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1066#discussion_r470975915).; For the user interface, this is being or was discussed in [here](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1364#issue-981474153). Some time ago, I made a PR #1066 to correct the SA model in SU2. Further I had the intention to implement the above presented approach to the SA for that pull request. However since the the presented approach can also be applied to the [SST](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/discussions/1403#discussion-3625259) or any turbulence model, I decided to create a new pull request. _Please note that this is a very draft pull request, it is not meant to work at all._. ## Documentation; Down below I will explain the ""theory"" behind it as well as the code structure that I will try to follow, just in case someone wants to replicate it for the SST. Regarding the user interface, I did not work on that yet. I will address it at the end. ### Theory; The Spalart-Allamaras correction/variation models to be implemented in SU2 are listed below. One can find a detailed description for example in [NASA TMR website](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/spalart.html).; - Spalart-Allmaras standard; - Spalart-Allmaras negative; - Spalart-Allmaras **yes** ft2 term; - Spalart-Allmaras mixing layer compressibility correction; - Spalart-Allmaras Edwards modification; - Spalart-Allmaras QCR-2000. The first step is to identify the core, i.e., the mathematical formulation that is shared/common between all of them. Below I provide a very short description of their main characteristics. #### Spalart-Allmaras standard; In the literature one can find a correction that sets the ft2-term to zero. However, the current baseline model in SU2 sets this ft2-term to zero.

Availability," with more cores, as all objects files are build truly in parallel (with make only objects of the same target are build in parallel). Another advantage is that meson has multiplatform support for linux, mac and windows. . ### Why not cmake ?; Meson files are much easier to read and in general it is much better to maintain. Furthermore it has a great documentation. Finally, meson has no dependencies apart from python and we can easily ship it (as a submodule) since it needs no installation/compilation. . ### What is ninja ?; ninja is a replacement for make and is used to execute the compiler and to resolve dependencies. Meson uses ninja as the default backend. So instead of using configure + make, we use meson + ninja. As with meson, we can ship it as a submodule. It needs a compilation, but again it has no dependencies apart from python. ### How to use ?; The correct meson and ninja versions are added as git submodules. So in case you don't have meson and ninja installed (there should be packages available for all major distros), compile ninja using:. ```; cd externals/ninja; ./configure.py --bootstrap; cd ..; export PATH=$PWD/externals/ninja:$PWD/externals/meson:$PATH; ```; and run meson using; ```; meson.py build --prefix=$PWD -Denable-pywrapper=true -Denable-autodiff=true; ```; to ocnfigure SU2 with the python wrapper and AD support enabled. MPI support will be enabled by default if a proper mpi installation can be found. ; Finally compile the code with; ```; ninja -C build; ```. - ""build"" in the commands above is a folder where the configuration will be stored. You can configure multiple directories with different configurations (like for a debug build etc); - ninja uses all available cores in your system by default. Still you can set the number of jobs using `-j N`. ### Additional notes; - Meson requires python 3, so implicitly we get this requirement now.

The aim was to optimize the blade leading edge with respect to outlet static pressure (_please note that the mesh is rotating_):. ![Screenshot (157)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96534491/236707270-c9de2899-1a72-4876-975c-eabaec826c4f.png). The mesh is deliberately coarse being the intention to firstly perform the simulation utilizing Euler's convective scheme. ; Subsequently, the flow field is computed correctly and the solution is converged. The solution was obtained setting up the turbomachinery simulation options available in SU2. After this initial procedure the FFD Box was successfully generated ( FFD_DEGREE = 2,2,2 ) and attached to the domain as explained in the tutorials ( *using SU2_DEF* ). The FFD box appears as follows:. *FFD box edges: green ; FFD box control point: yellow; There is no intersection between FFD edges and periodic boundaries*. ![Screenshot (158)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96534491/236707553-92fb9e5a-3808-4ea0-a02e-43b574de44c0.png).

Availability,"## Motivation; Fundamental bottlenecks exist for industrial adoption of high-fidelity physics codes with fully coupled discrete adjoint sensitivity analysis. These bottlenecks include a lack of flexibility, modularity, and robustness of the computational tools, as well as the potential startup development costs needed to implement and verify the MDAO features. The purpose of this work is to facilitate the coupling of SU2 with external structural codes (e.g. NASTRAN, TACS, Airbus structural suite Lagrange) for gradient-based aerodynamic shape and structural sizing optimization using dedicated frameworks (e.g. OpenMDAO). . Startup development costs include the creation of modular tools that are _designed to be driven_ by another framework like OpenMDAO, rather than _to drive execution_ themselves. However, leveraging those MDAO frameworks assumes that software codes and modules to be coupled exist, have appropriate data structures, execution and query APIs, and are wrapped in Python for flexibility and ease of use. The proposed changes were motivated with the goal of making SU2 more modular and flexible, particularly to facilitate its integration into large-scale MDAO frameworks. For more details on the motivation, methodology, and verification & validation results, please refer to our [paper from AIAA Aviation 2022](https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-3358). . ## Proposed Changes; @aa-g and I propose the following code updates:. 1. Implementation of residual-based discrete adjoint solver as `CDiscAdjResidualSolver`; a. New config option: `KIND_DISC_ADJ` . 2. Enhancements and standardization of SU2 Python API; a. Add pysu2/pysu2ad methods; b. Standardize Python API and function names ; c. Overloaded getter/setter methods to make data handling more flexible. ## Related Work; These efforts are related to Issue #1262, Pull Request #1300, and Discussion [#1325](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/discussions/1325). . ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the deve",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1750:223,robust,robustness,223,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1750,1,['robust'],['robustness']

Availability,"## Proposed Changes. The draft pull request has changes to fix couple of issues in the incompressible solver for rotating frame and convergence rate of unsteady problems (both with and without grid movement).; ; For the rotating frame, there was a confusion between conservative and primitive variables being used for the numerics. For the convergence rate of unsteady problems, the Jacobian contributions in the dual time residual calculations had been altered to include the preconditioner. However, this slows down the convergence from only an order of 100 iterations needed for converged solution per time step to the order of 1000 iterations. Therefore this has been reverted to regain the previous faster convergence rate and further work is necessary to understand the reason for this change. ## Related Work; PR #652 . ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

This PR adds the following features:; - New pressure inlet BC (specify total pressure) for the incompressible solver; - New mass flow outlet BC (specify target mass flow) for the incompressible solver; - Added outlet BC values to multipoint optimization options in python.

For two inlet and outlets with different types, you would specify it as:. INC_INLET_TYPE= PRESSURE_INLET VELOCITY_INLET; INC_OUTLET_TYPE= MASS_FLOW_OUTLET PRESSURE_OUTLET. and the type order corresponds to the order of the markers given in MARKER_INLET and MARKER_OUTLET, respectively.

Paraview XML format is now the default format (*.vtu) if the option `OUTPUT_FILES` is not present. I wanted to do that already when I added the XML format in January, but I simply forgot...

Availability,"## Proposed Changes. This is a draft PR to discuss and document a much needed overhaul of the shape optimization features in SU2. There have been significant improvements to the main code base (for example, python wrapper integration, the new output structure, new mesh solver etc.) which haven't been leveraged by the shape optimization structure of SU2. . The main idea behind this overhaul is to move as much of the functionality of the current shape optimization framework to python. This creates a more user-friendly and robust interface for defining design variables and constraints. Its easy to make that claim, but let me elucidate it with an example:. > Suppose I am trying to optimize a wing for a given flight condition but I want more design freedom than altering the airfoil shapes along the wing using FFDs. I want to be able to control wing span, taper ratio, dihedral angle, twist, and any number of other geometrical representations of the wing. Currently, I would have to create a new Design Variable (DV) for most of those variables. If anyone has tried this, they know it is a tedious task with having to make alterations in various parts of the code.; >; > But all of these design variables can be represented by aggregations of FFD point movements. The span of the wing can be controlled by constraining the movement of FFD points in the y-direction to be proportional to their y coordinate. The current twist variable does a similar aggregation, at each twist location it rotates the corresponding 4 FFD points by the given angle. ; >; >These design variables could be represented by simple python functions that take in a set of FFD points and aggregate their movement in the desired way. All this can be done without any incision into the C++ code, given a python interface that can provide the C++ code the final FFD point locations and letting it do the deformation. . Moving functionality to python could also remove the need for some of the other SU2 modules that haven't ",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/922:526,robust,robust,526,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/922,2,['robust'],['robust']

They complement, rather than replace, validation and verification tests. They are most useful when you want to isolate a specific behavior. Unit-testing increases development time, but improves the quality of the code and reduces code-maintenance time \[[source](https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/TDDpaperv8.pdf)\]. ### Vision. In my mind, the most efficient way to proceed is to add unit tests as new behaviors are added and bugs are fixed. With each new PR, we should ask ""Should this have a unit test to verify this behavior?"" Unit tests will provide a clear way to show that each PR does what the developer promises it will do. This will require refactoring some of the code. Some parts of the code, like the CConfig class, are not unit-testing friendly. Unit testing is hard when you have God-classes and ""do-it-all"" functions. The hope is that refactoring these classes will lead to more modular and easier-to-maintain code. ### Decision to use Catch2. Catch2 was chosen for the unit testing library for the following reasons:. + It can be included as a header-only library.; + It has a very clean, easy-to-use syntax; + It has widespread use, including the FEniCS library. ### Design choices. The following design choices are in place. If you disagree with them, then please start a discussion here:. + All tests are placed in a root-level directory named `UnitTests`. Inside this directory is a structure just like the existing folder structure (e.g. `SU2_CFD/numerics`), except that there are not separate `src` and `include` folders.; + Tests are grouped by class, and put in files such as `CNumerics_tests.cpp`.; + A single test executable is compiled and run, as opposed to a separate test executable for each group of tests. With the single test executable, you can always filter down to groups of tes",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/850:407,mainten,maintenance,407,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/850,1,['mainten'],['maintenance']
Availability,"## Proposed Changes. This is the modified version of SU2 code that supports CUDA usage for the FGMRES solver and the use of NVBLAS. The main focus is the offloading of the Matrix Vector Product in the FGMRES solver to the GPU using CUDA Kernels. This implementation shows promise with marginally better run times (all benchmarks were carried out with the GPU Error Checking switched off and in debug mode to check if the correct functions were being called). The use of NVBLAS is secondary and while functionality has been added to make it usable, it is not activated as it doesn't cause an appreciative increase in performance. ## Compilation and Usage. Compile using the following MESON Flag; ```; -Denable-cuda=true; ```; And activate the functions using the following Config File Option; ```; ENABLE_CUDA=YES; ```. ## NOTE ON IMPLEMENTATION. I've decided to go with a single version of the code where the CPU and GPU implementations co-exist in the same linear solver and can be disabled or switched using a combination of Meson and Config File options. This is why I have defined three classes - one over-arching class that is named CExecutionPath that has two child classes - CCpuExecution and CGpuExecution. These child classes contain the correct member function for each path - CPU or GPU functioning. . All of this could also be easily achieved with an if statement that switches between the two - but that particular implementation will access and run the statement for each call. In our case once a Matrix Vector Product object is created, it will immediately know whether to use CPU or GPU mode of execution. . Recommendations are most welcome to improve or make this implementation better. ## PR Checklist. Warning Levels do come (only at level 3) but they are all of the following type. ```; style of line directive is a GCC extension; ```.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; *Give a brief overview of your contribution here in a few sentences.*; ; I believe it would be helpful if the user can choose between relative or absolute values for cauchy convergence. ; Example: For the clean aircraft, the rolling moment coefficient MOMENT_X is close to zero and thus will never reach a relative cauchy convergence ->> dividing tiny numbers is not a good idea. Using absolute cauchy convergence is more robust in this case. At the same time, I understand that a more complex input / more parameters might confuse users. An automatic switch, as propsed in this pull request, is a good compromise. The code now switches automatically to absolut cauchy convergence if the coefficient is < 0.1 to avoid the problem described above. The config file is unchanged. .

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; *Give a brief overview of your contribution here in a few sentences.*; ; This PR greatly improves the robustness and convergence behavior of the flow solvers by implementing a more sophisticated controller for nonlinear iterations along with several other important modifications. The changes are the following:; - New under-relaxation strategy. Variables such as density and energy are only allowed to change by +/- 20% with each nonlinear iteration by applying an under-relaxation parameter to the updates at each node, which helps with difficult transients, especially at calculation startup. Also applied to turbulence model updates (though threshold is larger).; - CFL adaption via an exponential progression with under-relaxation approach, i.e., changes to CFL are coupled to the under-relaxation parameter (small under-relaxation parameter = decrease, and large = increase). CFL is now locally defined for each CV for this process.; - Modified realizability checks to avoid negative density/pressure/temperature at the nodes and also during 2nd-order reconstruction at cell faces.; - CV face states for 2nd-order MUSCL are now optionally reconstructed with a separate gradient method (unweighted least squares recommended), which is very important for robustness. Gradients for viscous terms and sources are still computed via GG or WLS for accuracy reasons.; - SA model was being clipped unnecessarily. This clipping has been removed. Here is my recommendation on how to run all of your 2nd-order cases going forward:. ### Euler / Laminar N-S; Turn off the limiters, unless you truly need them for preserving solution monotonicity (e.g., for shocks/discontinuities). Use ; ```; NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON= LEAST_SQUARES; ```; for robustness. Start with a CFL around 10 and converge the implicit system with LINEAR_SOLVER_ITER= 10 for each nonlinear iteration (FGMRES + ILU0 recommended).

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; Added CMake build support for SU2. With this, many popular IDEs will be able to use SU2 as a project with minimal setup. CMake also enables to add dependencies more easily since most libraries have CMake support. `vcpkg` is great for the libraries available there. SU2 CMake has the same build options as autotools but uses CMake to find system libraries and compilers (MKL, Mutationpp, MPI and Python currently). No longer need to specify paths to compilers/libraries if they are in standard locations. In addition, compile flags can be modified from CMake. There is no need to use `preconfigure.py` anymore since downloading/unpacking is handled by CMake and is system-agnostic. At the moment, all library targets are static but that could be easily changed to be configurable from CMake. The installation directory is `${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}/bin`. Similarly to autotools, some build options are disabled if built with Codi forward/reverse datatypes or without MPI. Note that SWIG fails to compile `pySU2ad` with `Nothing known about namespace 'medi'` in `Common/include/mpi_structure.hpp:57` without `-includeall` SWIG option but then it takes forever to generate the wrapper (more than 15 minutes on my machine, stopped early). I suggest removing `using namespace` declarations and either importing used symbols explicitly with `using` or prepending namespace name, `clang-tidy` warns against them and it makes the code clearer. SU2 CMake options are:; * Build modules:; * `SU2_BUILD_CFD`: `ON|OFF`; * `SU2_BUILD_DEF`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi; * `SU2_BUILD_DOT`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi forward; * `SU2_BUILD_GEO`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi; * `SU2_BUILD_MSH`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi; * `SU2_BUILD_PY_WRAPPER`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi forward; * `SU2_BUILD_SOL`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi; * Enable modules:; * `SU2_ENABLE_CGNS`: ; * `SU2_CGNS_CPPFLAGS`: flags to pas",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814:269,avail,available,269,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814,2,"['avail', 'down']","['available', 'downloading']"

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; Compute Green-Gauss gradients and limiters via a point-loop (like we do for Least Squares), in the limit this allows one thread per point of parallelization. Parallel regions are started inside the functions and again only the master thread calls MPI routines. Move these routines out of CSolver and make them general to reduce code duplication (compressible/incompressible, solution/primitives), and to improve test-ability (if key areas of the code depend less on large objects we can more easily treat them as units). Introduce a way to create different limiters by defining small details like the limiter function (and its associated constants), or any geometry-based modification.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi all,. This PR adds the possibility to write ASCII STL files. Example usage:; `OUTPUT_FILES= (RESTART,PARAVIEW, STL, ...)`; All surfaces in `MARKER_PLOTTING` will be used, just like the surface files. The major problem was to re-process the element connectivity for parallel cases from what the data available after the parallel data sorter does its thing. You'll notice that in the `CSTLFileWriter.cpp` : Part of the code was copied over from the TecIO stuff and modified to our needs. The code probably could be nicer and it could be better documented, but I already forgot some details and it most likely would still be a mess to understand. Big thanks to @talbring for making this code work. I added a simple regression test by `diff`ing against a reference stl-file from in the Testcases repo. I'll add that information [on the website here](https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Custom-Output/) once this PR is merged. ## Related Work; Resolves issue #694 (which was marked stale and was closed in the meantime). ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi all,; ; a wrong index (iZone vs iInst) caused the SU2_SOL module to segfault if nZone > nInst. The geometry container is called with the wrong index in the `CBaseLineSolver::LoadRestart` routine. In SU2_SOL.cpp `&geometry_container[iZone][INST_0]` to `geometry_container[iZone]` are interchangeable, I just thought the 2nd formulation is used more often throughout the code. I cannot guarante though that it now runs for multiple instances, but as far as I know there is no such testcase. Testcase: The PR does not come with a Testcase which would catch the error in the future. In testcases started with parallel_computation.py the SU2_SOL module is called and fails for multizone cases (e.g. Jones_rst.cfg which I tested on) but if the residuals fit the case passes. That circumstance is not tackled in this PR but I heard that this is a know issue. I briefly chatted with @rsanfer about that and I offer my help if this is approached. . Additionally I fixed an error message to contain the correct config-option and added a --disable-tecio option to the preconfigure.py script as it is convenient for me as I build on compute nodes which cannot access the necessary X11 libraries and I couldn't get it to work with tecio enabled :( .

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi everyone, . I have found some inconsistencies with respect to the literature on the implementation of the Menter's SST model. I would like to use this branch as test bench for any corrections/improvements made to the SST model. Implementation errors found:; - Use of production limiter constant in the clipping of the cross-diffusion term for the computation of the F1 blending function in CTurbSSTVariable.cpp. ; - SST naming conventions (V in V2003m should stay for Vorticity production term.). Not yet assessed.; - Wrong cross-diffusion term included into the residual of w in turb_sources.hpp. It should not be only the positive value as considered in the computation of the F1 blending function. As stated in https://doi.org/10.2514/3.12149. ""CDkw is the; positive portion of the cross-diffusion term in Eq (A2)"" pag. 1604. Moreover, a clipping has been introduced for large negative values of this term, as suggested in Peng, Shia-Hui, Peter Eliasson, and Lars Davidson. ""Examination of the shear stress transport assumption with a low-Reynolds number k-omega model for aerodynamic flows."" Eq 17.; - Boundary conditions errors at inlets, following the Issue #1851. A fix has been proposed following @pcarruscag suggestions for the supersonic inlet BC.; - Boundary conditions definitions are different than the ones proposed in TMR. Maybe give the user the choice to use the BCs implemented in SU2 or the ones from TMR. Changes to SST model proposed:; - Inclusion of non modified versions of SST. In this case I think that more work is needed to be sure that the correct terms are taken into account everywhere in the code.; - Give the user the possibility of changing the production limiter for TKE (not essential).; - Change values of default turbulent to laminar viscosity to 1e-2 (NASA TMR reports that it should be in the range of 1e-2 to 1e-5, but in SU2 this is set to 10 as default). .

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi everyone,. I have been working on the implementation of the DDES formulations for the SST model, following the work in ""Development of DDES and IDDES Formulations for the k-ω Shear Stress Transport Model"" (DOI:10.1007/s10494-011-9378-4). The implementation is easy, whereas the validation may take some time. I am currently working on the backward facing step and I will work on the flatplate too. The choice of the validation test cases is key since the computational cost is quite large, thus if you have any suggestions that may speed up this part then feel free to write them down. . Implemented versions:; - SST-DDES; - SST-IDDES; - SST-SIDDES. I am also working on the Scale Adaptive Simulations (SAS) implementations for SST, following the work in ""ON URANS SOLUTIONS WITH LES-LIKE BEHAVIOUR"", Travis et al., and ""[Evaluation of scale-adaptive simulation for transonic cavity flows"", Babu et al., (https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJESMS.2016.075510). The last one, especially, is quite tricky due to the computation of the velocity laplacian. I tried computing it in Paraview as the divergence of the gradient field and it seems quite similar, but it is the first time that I've touched that section of the code, thus some work might still be needed. Implemented versions:; - SST-SAS_Simple (better naming is necessary), from the article of Travis et al.; - SST-SAS_Complicated (better naming is necessary), it is related to the article from Babu et al. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; I found two bugs that lead to crashes when trying to restart a shape optimization problem:. 1. The python code still uses the deprecated `has_key` function for dicts.; 2. If the default config file is used in the python scripts, then the aerodynamic coefficients aren't saved anywhere even if `aerodynamics` is called. You can reproduce the bugs using the following MWE:. #### Minimal working example. As per the documentation, you should be able to restart a previous shape optimization problem with a command like:; ```; python shape_optimization.py -f turb_SA_RAE2822.cfg -r project.pkl; ```; where the `-r` command specifies a pickle files with the saved project state from a previous run. I checked the problem on the [RAE2822 constrained optimization tutorial](https://su2code.github.io/tutorials/Turbulent_2D_Constrained_RAE2822/). You can download the files using the instructions on that page. In order to reproduce the bug, run the following chain of commands:. 1. As per the tutorial, run `SU2_GEO turb_SA_RAE2822.cfg`; 2. Modify the `turb_SA_RAE2822.cfg` file to specify that `OPT_ITERATIONS=1`; 3. Run `python $SU2_RUN/shape_optimization.py -f turb_SA_RAE2822.cfg`; 4. Modify the `turb_SA_RAE2822.cfg` file to specify that `OPT_ITERATIONS=2`; 5. Run `python $SU2_RUN/shape_optimization.py -f turb_SA_RAE2822.cfg -r project.pkl`. ## Remaining work. This should be covered by a test case. The problem I used takes a bit of time to compute, even using just the restart. Is there an cheaper shape optimization problem that could run quickly as a test case?. ## Related Work; None. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; In a previous PR the SST model implementation in the CTurbSSTSolver was corrected to use the vorticity magnitude to calculate the turbulent viscosity (mu_T). But this change was not copied in the relevant numerics class where mu_T is used to calculate production terms. This is probably going to break all the SST related regression tests, so I will ensure convergence of those cases and update regression values. ; ; ## Related Work; A relevant discussion to have here is whether to update the SST turbulence model according to a 2003 paper by Menter (author of the SST model): [Ten years of industrial experience with the SST turbulence model](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.460.2814&rep=rep1&type=pdf). It involves tiny changes to coefficients, production limits, and uses strain magnitude instead of the vorticity magnitude to calculate mu_T. The last point means reversing the change that this PR is making. But currently the model is just inconsistent and needs to be corrected. .

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; Similar to the quasi-Newton acceleration provided by `CQuasiNewtonInvLeastSquares`, the proposed toolbox class `CNewtonUpdateOnSubspace` performs a correction on adjoint solution updates by keeping track of past iterates. Here, they are used to identify eigenvectors with large eigenvalues which slow down the overall convergence and to form a (small) subspace basis from them. Each fixed-point solution update is then [projected onto that subspace and the projected part will be additionally corrected via a ""real"" Newton step (a.k.a. ""RPM"")](https://doi.org/10.1137/0730057) using the computational graph for precise derivative information. This preliminary result with one basis vector indicates that the procedure can be effective at very low additional cost (for n basis vectors, it mainly reduces to n scalar products of the current fixed-point iterate with the basis vectors, the Newton step is cheap as n is small).

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; The current PR serves two purposes. First, it extends the sliding interface capabilities for multi-zone fluid-fluid interfaces to incompressible flows.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; This PR adds a regression testing pipeline based on the new Github actions features (https://github.com/su2code/SU2/actions). It uses docker containers for building and running the tests (https://hub.docker.com/r/su2code/build-su2 and https://hub.docker.com/r/su2code/test-su2, respectively, based on Ubuntu18.04/gcc7.4/OpenMPI2). This has several advantages over the current (Travis based) system:. - Using the containers you can run the building/testing environment locally on your machine. You can even download the compiled binaries produced on github and run them locally to further debug problems.; - It is faster and more flexible. Compiling and running all tests requires ~1h since a lot of things run in parallel now (e.g. building the base, reverse AD and forward AD binaries). There is potential to further speed things up by splitting the test case scripts into several files. All of that requires minimal work. Unfortunately there is no caching using ccache at the moment, but it is likely that github introduces this feature mid of november. ; - Additional tests like unit tests can make use of the same docker containers and can be easily set up by creating a new workflow file.; - We can easily add a deployment step to automatically create releases and/or nightly builds. **Note:** the linked docker containers are **only** for development/testing purposes. Hence we cannot give any support in this regard. For production use it is recommended to use singularity containers. But: the docker containers can be used as basis layers for singularity. I will get back with more information on that topic. ~~I had to change regression test values of two cases since apparently they are compiler dependent.~~ I changed it to the same versions as we have on Travis.

The reasons for these additions are; - The Piperno limiter is implemented in Inria's Wolf solver and seems to be used in a lot of their mesh adaptation work (see these references for [Euler](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02378738v2/document) and [RANS](https://hal.inria.fr/tel-01962318/file/these_archivage_3570223.pdf)); - Some preliminary tests with the Piperno limiter have converged solutions on triangulated BL meshes that @jayantmukho and I couldn't get to converge with other limiters in SU2 (e.g. triangulated DSMA661 meshes from TMR); - The MUSCL parameter exists in other solvers (FUN3D, CFL3D, Wolf) and is used by the NASA codes for many of the TMR cases (e.g. CFL3D uses 1/3 and FUN3D uses 1/2 for the DSMA661 case).

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; This PR fixes a couple issues in the nonlinear adaptive CFL scheme. - Convergence of the linear solver was assumed if the residual was greater than 0.5, which is quite large. I replaced this with the linear solver tolerance.; - The sum of nonlinear residuals was never computed for steady since `TimeIter` was used.; - The under-relaxation parameters for the flow solver and turbulent solver both took the min of each other and were never reset for steady, meaning it was non-increasing. @jayantmukho and I wanted to discuss more possible improvements to the scheme. I wanted to open this up before making any actual changes. - Currently there is a check for stalling residuals (the sum over 100 iterations of delta_Res must be > 0.1 Res), but this doesn't protect against increasing residuals. We should implement another check to prevent divergence.; - Instead of computing a single local CFL for flow/turbulence with a reduction factor for turbulence, maybe it would be better to have both solvers make their own call to `AdaptCFLNumber` and compute their own local CFL based on their own ResRMS.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; This PR is about the implementation of a rough wall boundary condition for SA and SST models. A given realistic roughness distribution must be first converted to an ""equivalent sand grain roughness"" height and specified as an input. . For the SA turbulence model, the roughness boundary condition is based on:. Aupoix, B. and Spalart, P. R., ""Extensions of the Spalart-Allmaras Turbulence Model to Account for Wall Roughness,"" International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow, Vol. 24, 2003, pp. 454-462. . Very briefly, the new model assumes there is a ""virtual wall"" located on top of the roughness elements and thus the distance to nearest wall is modified for all points based on the specified sand grain roughness. Additionally, the boundary condition at the wall is now not set to zero but a mixed condition (robin BC) is applied allowing for a non-zero eddy viscosity at the wall. More information is also available [here](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/spalart.html#sarough). For the SST model, the roughness boundary condition is based on:. Wilcox, D.C Turbulence Modeling for CFD., 1998 and 2006, DWC Industries. There are two suggestions (first in the 2nd edition and a corrected version in the 3rd edition).

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; This is a little improvement to the multipoint optimization setup. Currently if you want to run multipoint optimization with restarts, the python scripts only keep track of one restart file (the first of the multipoint conditions). This is acceptable when the multipoint conditions are similar, but does not work when the conditions are very different. For example, if one point is supersonic and the other is subsonic, and the subsonic case is restarted from the supersonic solution, it immediately diverges. . This PR allows the python scripts to keep track of restarts for each point in the multipoint set up. It is robust in the sense that you can start with 0 restart files or some subset of restart files. For example, if you are running a 3 point optimization but only have the restart for one of the points, this will handle that case by starting the other two points from scratch, but keeping track of the restart files after the first design iteration. There is a naming convention that is presumed. The restarts get 'point#' added to its base name. So for example, if the SOLUTION_FILENAME= solution_flow.dat then it will look for files named solution_flow_point0.dat, solution_flow_point1.dat and so on. For adjoints this is solution_adj_point0_cd.dat etc. This naming convention can be tweaked according to comments. . ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; This is a tiny PR to add a conditional operator in CFlowOutput.cpp to avoid calling to GetNodes() function if the solver is a FEM/DG solver. In one of the early commits (34b0464e898dd167d8a865f47aa630019a5978ac), a call to GetNodes() was added in `CFlowOutput::SetAnalyzeSurface` which calls the function `GetNodes()`. ```const auto flow_nodes = solver[FLOW_SOL]->GetNodes();```. There is an assertion in `GetNodes()` that further mandates the `CVariable` `base_nodes` to be set properly. However, in the FEM/DG solver, the `base_nodes` is defaulted to `nullptr` and we have workarounds in the FEM/DG sovler that does not require a call to `GetNodes()` in other parts of the code (we use elements instead of nodes, so the concept of nodes is not really well-defined in the FEM/DG solver). . At the moment, the develop branch will fail at this line if anyone attempts to use the FEM/DG solver. . E.g., Taking the `hom_euler/NACA0012_5thOrder` test case in the repo gives the following error message:; ```SU2_CFD: ../SU2_CFD/src/output/../../include/solvers/CSolver.hpp:230: const CVariable* CSolver::GetNodes() const: Assertion `base_nodes!=nullptr && ""CSolver::base_nodes was not set properly, see brief for CSolver::SetBaseClassPointerToNodes()""' failed.``` at the pre-processing stage before any computation is done. Hence, a conditional operator is added to avoid this call for DG solvers. ## Related Work; *Resolve any issues (bug fix or feature request), note any related PRs, or mention interactions with the work of others, if any.*; @vdweide and I are working on a new version of the DG solver that needs this workaround anyway.

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; This is the initial PR for a long overdue refactorization of the mesh deformation routines. The mesh deformation acquires here a full ""solver"" status, and uses the FEA Elasticity classes as its basis. The pseudo-linear elastic solver now always refers to the initial, undeformed geometrical discretization, therefore ensuring that the problem remains traceable to the original mesh, and that when volumes are computed to deform the mesh, the initial quality of the elements is observed. . With this framework, the wall distances only need to be computed once for distance-based stiffness, and the stiffness matrix is now symmetric after applying BCs so conjugate gradient can be used to compute the mesh deformation. The adjoint sensitivities can now be propagated down to the surface mesh points without the need to use DOT, although further work is needed to propagate them to the FFD points or other DV of choice. I tried to keep config options simple: the new mesh solver is enabled using; ` DEFORM_MESH = YES `; and the relevant markers which will move and introduce deformations into the domain are set using; `MARKER_DEFORM_MESH= ( wall )`; Hopefully, previous mesh deformation structures can be deprecated and removed soon, but we will need to adapt the rigid/imposed boundary deformation of other kinds of grid movement. I kindly ask for your help in there, as I'm not very familiar with some of the legacy code for this purpose. Additionally, in this PR I have done some refactoring so the AD-based adjoint routines are accessible from the python-wrapped version of the code. The SWIG wrapper now compiles the AD binaries and interfaces directly to sensitivity information, which should make it much easier to integrate SU2 within any python-based optimization framework. . ## Related Work; - Some work will be needed to adapt the new contiguous variable structure by @pcarruscag in #753; - I have added a couple of regression tests, but I will add tutorials once #724 i",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/760:786,down,down,786,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/760,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"## Proposed Changes; To improve robustness of the SU2 code, specifically when using the SST (1994/2003) model, we would like to suggest a slight modification to the lower limits of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and the specific turbulent dissipation rate (Omega). Presently, the lower limits are given as follows:; TKE_LoweLimit = 1E-10; Omega_LowerLimit = 1E-4. Estimating if these lower limits are sufficiently low is very difficult.; They may be too high. This is certainly the case whether one runs in a dimensional or non-dimensional mode. It may be sufficiently low for one mode but marginally low for the second mode. Therefore, we suggest clipping the solution relative to the TKE and Omega freestream values such that:. TKE_LowerLimit = C_k * TKE_infinity; Omega _LowerLimit = C_w * Omega_infinity. Where C_k and C_w are constants. . The control over these constants is given to the user, However based on our 20 years of experience with the k-w models, Omega will not drop below 1E-3 * Omega_infinity (converged solution). However, in the process of convergence, it may reach lower values. Therefore, a value of . C_w = 1E-6. is reasonable. The solution of TKE is not very sensitive to C_K (assume it is sufficiently low). We recommended:. C_K = 1E-20. setting these as default values. . ## Related Work; Results of the change on convergence of VFE2 test case are presented. Two configurations of CFL adaptation were tested on both the original and modified lower limit code, ; 1. CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.99, 1.005, 5.0, 50.0, 0.0001 ) named max CFL 50 ; 2.

Availability,"## Scope; Elasticity problems can be quite demanding linear solver wise as your typical case will have very few Dirichlet boundaries.; Common iterative methods can only go so far, and pseudo time strategies to improve conditioning do not work as well as for fluid problems due to the elliptic nature of the equations.; Scalability is also an issue since most preconditioners get weaker as the problem gets partitioned.; Direct sparse solvers handle these problems just fine, so life is good again, until you run out of RAM that is (which only ever happens in 3D).

Availability,"### Preamble. I am moving the discussion about SIMD that started in #716 here and adding hybrid parallelization.; The two topics go hand in hand since both (SPMD and SIMD) consist of processing multiple data (MD) elements simultaneous, either by a single program (SP) that is run by multiple threads (generally with shared view of memory), or by a single instruction (SI) run by a single core.; The reason SIMD came up in #716 is that, as I will demonstrate, vectorization needs to be supported by data structures. On the other hand SPMD needs to be supported by algorithms designed to avoid race conditions, two or more threads modifying the same memory location. Instead of continuing #716 I think it is better to let that become documentation for #753.; I did not add **without loss of readability** to the title because it is long as is, that requirement is present nonetheless.; I open these issues in the hope that people participate (I am not a fast writer so this is actually a lot of work) and so far great comments and insights have come from those with experience in these topics (kudos to @economon and @vdweide). But please participate even if you never heard of these topics, your opinion about readability and ""developability"" of the code is important! I think the code-style should be accessible to people starting a PhD (after they read a bit about C++...). My (ambitious) goal with this work is to lay down an architecture for performance, i.e. not just to improve the performance of a few key numerical schemes but to create mechanisms applicable to all existing and future ones. Moreover I want that to be possible with minimal changes to the way those bits of code are currently written.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789:1420,down,down,1420,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,") then a good approach is to ; 1. make your `enum` of choice an `enum class` and remove the associated numbers. ; 2. Rename here if reasonable, i,.e. `ENUM_INLET_TYPE` can be just `INLET_TYPE`. Also the option names to not be redundant so e.g. `INLET_TYPE::PRESSURE_INLET_TYPE` could become `INLET_TYPE::PRESSURE`; 3. Add a `NONE` or `NO_THING` option if needed. Often the global `NONE` option is and that made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move 🧙 ; 2. then you go to `CConfig.c/hpp` and change the option type and everything there (because in the `CConfig` class the variable is usually defined). Find the `GetKind_yourOption` and search the code base for that `Get` function.; 3. Once all search results and the following function bodies are changed just compile and fix until the code builds; 4. Special care for switch statements: If not all options are present make a `default; break;` line -> otherwise the automated builds will fail on a warning (clang is used, I found gcc does only complain with an additional flag); 4. commit at best just 1 commit with a clear message and push. That makes reverting easier if it fails and introduced some non-obvious error; ; Have fun :). ## Related Work; #1242. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"**Describe the bug**. You will have to bear with me, I might get some of this wrong, I am not entirely sure what is going on here so I will try and include as much information as possible. Using the tape tagging method developed by @oleburghardt in #2343 and presented at the most recent SU2 Conference, a run of the full tape reveals that a variable used in a preaccumulation output is not properly recorded. The variable is the `val` in the function `PassiveAssign` in `CSysMatrix.hpp` line 215. `FORCEINLINE static ScalarType PassiveAssign(const SrcType& val) {; return SU2_TYPE::GetValue(val);; }`. Following the call stack of the error reveals that the problem variables in `val` are the jacobian components calculated in the Roe and JST scheme (these are the two options I have tested). It is possible to resolve this error by simply moving the stopping of the preaccumulation region from before the call to `updateLinearSystem` in the `ComputeFlux` method of both these schemes, to after, as show below. `/*--- Update the vector and system matrix. ---*/. updateLinearSystem(iEdge, iPoint, jPoint, implicit, updateType,; updateMask, flux, jac_i, jac_j, vector, matrix);. /*--- Stop preaccumulation. ---*/. stopPreacc(flux);`. However, whilst this resolve the error in this location, the next error appears in the Giles boundary condition. Here the two jacobian components within the residual object are not recorded correctly in the preaccumulation output region also. This in `CEulerSolver.cpp:6556`. `/*--- Compute the residual using an upwind scheme ---*/; auto residual = conv_numerics->ComputeResidual(config);. /*--- Update residual value ---*/; LinSysRes.AddBlock(iPoint, residual);`. I have tried simpy adding these components as preacc outputs however they are SIMD arrays and the datatype cannot be converted using the existing implementation. .

On the left will be the current version of SU2 where quads are simply not written and on the right a fixed version where each quad is separated into 2 tris. ![stl_quads_tris](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31306376/58827759-17667700-8644-11e9-9e6f-4643d2e7fdb7.JPG). That was found (and fixed) by Fabian Woerenkaemper @ElGarno . As the output is currently overhauled, I shortly chatted with its adoptive father @talbring and I will adapt the fixed STL-writer to the new structure and it will (hopefully) go into develop with that in a somewhat near future. If you desperately ;) need that fix right now, I can add a patch for the current develop down below. Cheers, Tobi. **Desktop (please complete the following information):**; - SU2 Version: latest develop, but this problem is probably also present in older versions.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/694:448,down,down,448,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/694,2,['down'],['down']

I am running a WMLES channel flow test case with grid size 102 x 31 x 52 = 164424 nodes. When running the problem on a large number of cores, e.g. 128 cores, SU2 fails during the preprocessing step. Running valgrind gives the error; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41386609/97629439-580a2180-19eb-11eb-9e9f-023fc96c05aa.png); which for my version corresponds to this line; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41386609/97629473-66f0d400-19eb-11eb-89c8-9b677c720240.png); It seems that theres a mismatch on the receiver end. The problem disappears if I use smaller number of cores, e.g. 64, and everything will look normal (solution converges and SU2 exit normally). The actual number of MPI cores that triggers the bug seems to be problem dependent. I also ran a couple of finer grids but started to see the bug with 64 cores. For these finer mesh, reducing to a smaller number like 48 cores makes the problem disappear again. Similar problem has been observed by @clarkpede and mentioned in pecos-hybrid/su2#53 but he was using an older version of SU2 (v6.2.0). I should mention another common thing is that we are both using periodic boundary conditions. **To Reproduce**; *Please provide a config file and mesh for a minimal example that recreates the problem.*; [wmles_chan_re5200.zip](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/5461150/wmles_chan_re5200.zip); (Reminder: This has to be ran with very large number of cores though.

Availability,"**Describe the bug**; *Reference case and expectations*; After many, many tries, the Caradonna-Tung test case seems to ""converge"" towards a non-physical solution. The flow creates a vortex around the blade instead of generating a downward jet as one can expect (https://www.nas.nasa.gov/SC08/v22_2.html). The case simulates a propeller with a compressible Euler solver. *Main issue*; The outlet, pressure outlet, or farfield boundary conditions seems to destabilize after some iterations due to the high speed gradient on the outlet face. To get into more details, there is a vortex forming ring forming near of the outlet creating a inflow at the center. The BC seems to build on this inflow up to a point where the flow destabilizes the solution and diverges or pushes the flow to make a ring around the propeller. *Case setup and context*; To put some context the current case tries to simulate the flow-field generated by a blade/propeller in a hover state in order to compute the thrust. The blade is surrounded by a cylinder. The markers for each surfaces are:; -""inlet"" for the top of the cylinder; -""farfield"" for the sides of the cylinder; -""outlet"" for the bottom of the cylinder. The blade has been divided into 4 surfaces which have the following self explanatory marker names:; - ""propellerUpperSurface""; - ""propellerLowerSurface""; - ""propellerRightTip""; - ""propellerLeftTip"". Many combinations of the possible boundary conditions setup were tested for the ""inlet"", ""farfield"" and ""outlet"" markers. Furthermore the Inlet BC were tried with many different vertical speeds (vx=0/0.001/0.01/0.1/1/10). Simulations with the inlet, farfield and outlet as TOTAL_INLET, FARFIELD, OUTLET and EULER and some (not all) combination between these BC were tried. The mesh was generated with Salome-Meca. It is a tetrahedral mesh. I have a script that permits to change the domain size with ease.

Availability,"**Describe the bug**; I am reading the source code of SU2 V7.3.1, and I find the UnitNormal vector computed in BC_Sym_Plane(...) is different with other BCs such as Far Field, Inlet and so on, so I think the UnitNormal in BC_Sym_Plane is doubtful. At line 1135 in ""SU2_CFD/include/solvers/CFVMFlowSolverBase.inl"", the Normal vector has been negated for outward convention. While at line 1141, the UnitNormal vector is computed as:. UnitNormal [iDim]= -Normal[iDim] / Area,. where the UnitNormal vector is actually negated again, though the Normal vector is negated once and outward. And then this double-negated UnitNormal vector is employed to the whole computation of Symmetry BC, which will induce error to the ""ProjVelocity_i (line 1209)"" as well as ""V_reflected (1217)"" vector.

Changing the LINEAR_SOLVER_PREC sometimes helps. In this flatplate case ILU does better but for other simulations this stalling will persist. Adaptive CFL will almost certainly mess things up (even #790).

Availability,". Start with a CFL around 10 and converge the implicit system with LINEAR_SOLVER_ITER= 10 for each nonlinear iteration (FGMRES + ILU0 recommended). Activate the CFL adaption with. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down, factor up, CFL min value,; % CFL max value ); CFL_ADAPT= YES; CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.1, 2.0, 10.0, 1e10); ```. It is important that the linear solve behaves well for each nonlinear iteration, so if this does not converge immediately, adjust the tolerance or number of linear iterations. Roe seems very stable, but some of the other upwind schemes or centered schemes may require improved Jacobian accuracy (to recover fast convergence) with:. ```; USE_ACCURATE_FLUX_JACOBIANS= YES; CENTRAL_JACOBIAN_FIX_FACTOR= 4.0; ```. ### RANS; Due to the segregated approach for the turbulence models, you have to be more conservative with the CFL adaption. All else is the same as above, but I recommend. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down, factor up, CFL min value,; % CFL max value ); CFL_ADAPT= YES; CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.1, 1.2, 10.0, 1e3); ```. Most inviscid/laminar cases that I have tested so far converge to machine precision within a couple of hundred iterations. RANS cases within a few thousand. Ultra fine RANS meshes can still slow things down (MG could help there), but otherwise, speedups of an order of magnitude (or more) are possible for most problems. Experiment yourselves.. sometimes you can get even more performance, sometimes less, case depending. I could use help testing this one with your cases, since I think almost all regression tests will change. As a start, I have run all of the NASA TMR 2D bump-in-channel cases. Everything looks good with that (see figures). I have also checked that the inviscid and laminar MMS give 2nd-order accuracy properly. ![bump_cd_gridconv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4896083/64910870-09f36b00-d6d0-11e9-9e1c-553fd09b42c8.png); ![bump_cf_0p63_gridconv](https://user-images.githu",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790:2747,down,down,2747,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790,1,['down'],['down']

Unfortunately, given that during this time both #753 and #774 were merged, the tests are failing now. Particularly, the disc_adj_fsi case runs into a segfault in `CDiscAdjSolver::ExtractAdjoint_CrossTerm_Geometry`, when trying to execute ; `geometry->node[iPoint]->GetAdjointCoord(Solution_Geometry);`. . I believe this is related to the changes to the index based recording introduced in #774, as the code was running before into the same problem in `CDiscAdjSolver::ExtractAdjoint_CrossTerm`, and now goes beyond this point having changed the Get routine into `direct_solver->GetNodes()->GetAdjointSolution_intIndexBased(iPoint,Solution);`. Currently, there is no `GetAdjointCoord_intIndexBased` or similar available, and its implementation requires some constructs for the indices. Therefore, I would like to ask for support from @oleburghardt and @pcarruscag to make this work with their changes. ## Related Work; #724 involuntarily removed the discrete adjoint FSI cases from the regression tests.; Branch [fix_discadjfsi](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/fix_discadjfsi) successfully recovers the functionality removed.; #774 introduced relevant changes to the adjoint solver that are making.; #753 was merged and, although I tried to adapt to it, I can't guarantee it's working correctly. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"8-3b91-4476-9eae-8907b20a8bf7.png). To simplify a bit the problem, the geometry is assumed to be constant along the span. Therefore, a hybrid mesh is used on a 2d surface and is extruded along the span. The following pictures represented a global view of the test case, the hybrid mesh and the mesh distribution for the extrusion:. ![global](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24920252/140758176-d1e5da98-5e54-457e-9a80-92878a1e88ba.png); ![2dmesh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24920252/140756176-4560688b-1c6c-42e7-b404-95589764acad.png). ![extrusion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24920252/140756190-d5a423b7-c172-4fff-9fe3-53ed0364756e.png). As we can see, the mesh is refined near the two walls (the hub/shroud) to get a y+ of 1 and here starts my issue. . While I can retrieve a correct y+ near the blade, I have trouble to get a y+ lower than 65 near the walls. At y+ = 65, SU2 runs and converges to some results. For y+ < 65, SU2 raises a segmentation fault at this location: ; ![segfault](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24920252/140756620-db3ed08f-05cd-4811-b037-642a221ea501.png); Here are the results of the gdb analysis. It seems that the seg faut comes from the Giles BC part of the initialisation of the turbo data containers. Especially those lines (CEulerSolver.cpp line 435-436). `CkInflow[iMarker].resize(nSpanWiseSections,2*geometry->GetnFreqSpanMax(INFLOW)+1) = complex<su2double>(0.0,0.0);`. `CkOutflow1[iMarker].resize(nSpanWiseSections,2*geometry->GetnFreqSpanMax(OUTFLOW)+1) = complex<su2double>(0.0,0.0);`. but I don't understand why. ![issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24920252/140783485-0d856d2a-7353-468f-aeab-c78b742d8582.png).

Availability,"> Hello. Can you add a test case about AUSMPLUSUP or AUSMPLUSUP2? I installed SU2 6.2.0 and used it to simulate two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow.

Availability,"As described in Issue #431, using `SU2_MSH` for periodic mesh construction can be buggy due to its sorting of nodes. Under certain conditions, nodes can be duplicated and/or missing from the output *.su2 file. This pull request implements a more robust sorting process, where the sorting occurs in the following steps:. 1. Send/receive nodes are explicitly identified; 2. The sorted list is created without any send/receive nodes.; 3. The receive and then send nodes are added to the sorted list. Here's a few comments about the pull request:; + Since this routine is only run once, I felt the usability of std::vector outweighed the computational efficiency of raw arrays.; + I had to create two lists, NewSort and ReverseSort, instead of the original one list (NewSort). That's because two different mappings between node numbers need to occur. In the old code, where the list was sorted by switching elements, the two mappings _should_ have been identical. Since the improved method does not use switching, two lists are necessary.; + There's a lot of memory leaks/uninitialized values when checking this pull request with Valgrind. I checked them, and this pull request doesn't create any _new_ memory issues. Apparently both `SU2_CFD` and `SU2_MSH` have memory issues. #### Verification; Since none of the existing regression tests run `SU2_MSH`, I created a separate case to verify both the bug and the fix. It's a simple 3x3 cube that's periodic in the z-direction. I've attached the files below. Here's the steps:. 1. Run `SU2_MSH MSH.cfg`; 2. Run `SU2_CFD per_CFD_dev.cfg`. Using the existing develop branch, the verification case runs into a segfault when writing the output. This pull request allows the verification case to complete successfully.

Error output can be seen in: https://travis-ci.org/su2code/SU2/jobs/165118367. Fix should include the addition or modification of a regression test case to catch similar errors in the future.

Unfortunately, I have yet to install a working parallel version to run this tutorial. A solution to avoiding some of these installation issues would be to set up this environment within a singularity container. I found a singularity container definition for an old version of SU2 in #738 and modified the su2.def file to read:.

This code raises the following error after running . FATAL: Unable to build from su2.def: while parsing definition: su2.def: invalid selection(s) specified:.

Availability,"Dear friends of the Heat Solver and Periodic Boundary conditions, . I feared no exhausting work and added periodic BC to the Heat Solver. Stock up your supplies, cancel meetings for today and dive into the diff to review this piece. Ok for real, I don't know if that is all that has to be done? I did some early testing with mixed results, I noticed that I had to turn down CFL for the solid zone (1e4 in non-periodic case-> 1) to get a solution that seems to respect the periodicity. If the CFL is too large then I get some spurious temperature and weird residual pattern. Any comments are appreciated. This was just a first shot so Im gonna do more digging on that issue. ## Related Work; Periodic bc was initially implemented in #652 . ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"Description:. There is a problem in the `pysu2_nastran.py` script when reading the SET1 section from Nastran .f06 output files. The current implementation of the function that reads the SET1 section is insufficient for more complex, such as 3D, mesh structures. In the tutorial, a simple airfoil case is used with a mesh consisting of 123 surface nodes, which works fine. However, for more complex mesh structures, the SET1 section in the Nastran .f06 file includes additional lines with dates, headers, and the Nastran program's name. These extra lines cause issues while reading the SET1 section, leading to errors in processing the file. https://github.com/su2code/Tutorials/blob/master/multiphysics/unsteady_fsi_python/Ma01/modal.f06. line 376 starts with SET1.

Availability,"FULLMG_CYCLE produces segmentation faults in different ways:. 1. When using the SST turbulent solver; 2. When running in parallel (mpirun/mpiexec). This PR tries to fix these segmentation faults. ## Proposed Changes; **First issue**; In CTurbSSTSolver::CTurbSSTSolver() we do not initialize the residual nor the solution if we are using a FULLMG_CYCLE, producing a segmentation fault. I have included a line of code to consider the FULLMG_CYCLE scenario. **Second issue**; This issue is not related to mpi _per se_ but to domain partitioning.; In CMultiGridGeometry::CMultiGridGeometry() is computed the ratio between the number of points in the finest grid and a given coarse grid level. If this ratio is below 2.5 (I do not know why do we make this evaluation neither the reason why exactly 2.5) a multigrid level is removed (without warning the user!?), see lines 629-632. For a few cases that I have tested, when running in parallel certain grid levels have a ratio below 2.5 hence are removed. This does not happen when running in serial.; In CMultiGridIntegration::MultiGrid_Iteration() the index of the ""finest grid"" is then required and the system of equations at the ""finest grid"" level is intended to be solved. This index is set by default with the number multigrid levels specified by the user on the config file. In case that multigrid levels have been removed, when trying to access to the ""finest level"" mesh in CMultiGridIntegration::MultiGrid_Iteration() that level does not exist and produces a segmentation fault. To solve this issue:; - Stop removing multigrid levels in CMultiGridGeometry::CMultiGridGeometry() or improve the function. Why do we need to check whether the ratio is below a certain level? We should just check if the coarse level is empty, i.e., no control volumes.; - When removing a MG level in CMultiGridGeometry::CMultiGridGeometry() subtract one to the index of the finest grid, i.e., config->SubtractFinestMesh();.

Availability,"Hello SU2 community,. I'm currently interested in the theoretical background used in SU2_DOT (both in the FD or AD option). Is it available somewhere? The use I'm interested in is the propagation of the sensitivity of the selected objective function with respect to the boundary grid displacements to the FFD control point displacements. Moreover I have two specific questions:. 1) If, for design optimisation, design variables are the FFD control points, once performed the point inversion (which is usually done only at the beginning of the optimization process), the relation between surface grid nodes and FFD control points is fixed and analytically given by the Bernstein polynomials, once provided the parametric coordinates. Why, then, the need to perform the chain rule with Finite Differences or AD?. 2) SU2_DOT uses, to perform the chain rule, surface adjoint solution(in case of FD) or the volume adjoint solution (in case of AD). These values are provided in output by the SU2_CFD adjoint solver. If printing the solution in CSV format I can read, among others, values such `""Sensitivity_x"",""Sensitivity_y"",""Sensitivity_z"",""Surface_Sensitivity""` on every grid point. Now, these values, trying to give a look inside the code, are addressed as, respectively, sensitivities in x/y/z/normal directions. Are these values the sensitivity of the selected objective function with respect to the grid node displacement?. 3) In file `python_wrapper_structure.cpp` function; `vector<passivedouble> CDriver::GetMeshDisp_Sensitivity(unsigned short iMarker, unsigned long iVertex)` ; also provides boundary displacement sensitivities of the objective function, with the call:; `Disp_Sens[0] = solver->GetNodes()->GetBoundDisp_Sens(iPoint, 0);`. These values are, in effect the sensitivity of the objective function with respect to the grid node displacements as some Finite Difference tests confirmed. Anyway such values are different by the values mentioned above in question 2. Is that correct?

Availability,"Hello all,. I have a question about using the MARKER_INTERNAL. I was expecting that adding a MARKER_INTERNAL will not affect the solution in any way. Though, when I try to use it I observe a spurious spike in the solution at the location of the internal marker. . To create an interior marker in Pointwise, I create a baffle zone which connects two blocks (https://www.pointwise.com/doc/user-manual/cae/set-boundary-conditions/boundary-condition-connections.html). So there are two sides of the face and I marked them both as internal markers. This increases the number of elements in mesh because the nodes on the marker are duplicated (one for each side except on the perimeter). So essentially, at the each (x,y,z) location of the internal marker, there are two nodes. Instead of having 6 neighbors as an internal node (hex elements in 3-D), the two nodes ""share"" the neighbors which leads to error in momentum and mass balance in both the nodes causing errors in the solution. I am not quite sure how to fix this. Is there a different way to use internal markers? Or is the internal marker not supported anymore?.

Availability,"Hey everyone, . Following the discussions at the SU2 Developers meeting this week, I wanted to start a conversation about compiling a comprehensive set of V&V cases for SU2 that can showcase it's performance in comparison to other solvers. . I think the the [NASA TMR website](https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/index.html) is a good model to base it on. The idea would be to present the V&V case, provide working configuration and mesh files, and provide results comparing performance to other solvers and to higher fidelity data (when available). This allows people to see the performance of SU2 and replicate it, if need be. . The first step would be compiling a list of cases that should be covered. The [SU2 2014 SciTech paper](https://su2code.github.io/documents/SU2_AIAA_SciTech2014.pdf) would be a good starting point as it already had a couple of validation cases. This list can be bolstered with some of the NASA TMR cases, and with grid convergence studies. I would like to propose an initial list that the community can talk through and make changes as we see fit. I am mostly only familiar with canonical CFD flows that are used in these cases. But it would be great to have other cases, such as Turbo-machinary or FSI cases, that show the full breadth of SU2's abilities. This is by no means an exhaustive list:. 1.

Availability,"Hey there :wave:,. This is an ***automated PR*** to migrate recent [DEP](https://github.com/apps/dep) App users to a new [GitHub action](https://github.com/features/actions) called [Dependent Issues]( https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dependent-issues). . If you received this PR it means you have DEP installed on the organization level (not necessarily enabled on this repository). If you think this is a mistake, I'm sorry. Please close this PR. ### :newspaper: TLDR. * The current DEP app has _been deprecated in favor of the new [Dependent Issues](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dependent-issues)_ Github Action and it will be removed soon.; * The new Action works the same way the bot did but with additional features/changes:; - Works with both _PRs and issues_ (disabled by default).; - Works with _cross-repository_ dependencies e.g. `microsoft/vscode#999`.; - It _notifies users by writing a comment_ with the list of dependencies and keep their states updated. This is especially useful when having the action enabled for non-PR issues.; - Keywords and the label _can now be customized._; - It sets the state of the head commit on a PR _to `pending` instead of `failure`_ (shows as :orange_circle: instead of a :x: ) when some dependencies are not yet ready (i.e. closed). Breaking changes? Nothing. You can use the action the same way as before. eg. Writing `Depends on #number` or `Depends on owner/repo#number` clause(s) on the PR/issue description.

Availability,"Hi -. I'm at the AIAA meeting this week and downloaded SU2 after listening to few talks. I noticed you guys optionally link to tecio, the templet binary API, when it is available. . I'm the project manager of the libMesh finite element library, a general purpose C++ finite element library (http://libmesh.sourceforge.net). I also work at NASA/JSC in the Aerosciences & CFD group, hence the potential interest in SU2. In libMesh, we build a number of optional software dependencies from source - Metis, ParMetis, tecio, etc… We find this much preferable to requiring (simple) dependencies to be preinstalled by the user. This pull request adds the source files for tecio, along with automake integration, so that the Tecplot dependencies can be satisfied internally to SU2. The Tecplot tecio source is distributed openly at http://www.tecplot.com/downloads/tecio-library, so there are no issues with redistribution. Some notes on the implementation:; 1. It includes all the tecio sources,; 2. It includes the configure.ac & Makefile.am changes required. Specifically, I did _not_ update the Makefile.in or configure scripts you have checked in to your master, as my autotools are quite newer and doing so would result in unnecessary diffs. So I ask - do you guys have a requirement on the version of autotools you are using, since you are checking in derived files?. See relevant discussion here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4873065/autotools-and-version-control.

Availability,"Hi all, . I recently discovered the Gust simulation capabilities of SU2 for two-dimensional Euler flows. . I am trying to implement the additional terms necessary for extending the method to 3D Navier-Stokes flows. I am running into trouble when trying to implement the changes necessary to achieve this. For now, I have began working on the two functions responsible for the gust simulations:. 1. SU2/SU2_CFD/src/iteration_structure.cpp::CFluidIteration::SetWind_GustField; 2. SU2/SU2_CFD/src/numerics/flow/flow_sources.cpp::CSourceWindGust::ComputeResidual. From what I understand the extension to 3D should simply consist in modifying the function `SetWind_GustField` to impose a 3D grid-velocity instead of a 2D grid velocity, and adding the appropriate source terms in the function `CSourceWindGust` (these can even be set to zero, just to debug the code). . However, when I try to implement these changes, I get a segmentation fault that I cannot identify. . Does someone have an idea on how to implement this feature successfully ? .

My suggestion is that we all work together in having a list of branches with a short description in order to have an idea of where we stand. I would propose that all of you go through your feature branches and collect the following information about them:. - Branch name; - A two line description on the goal of the branch; - Status of the branch:; - Under active development (we are adding a new feature here); - Complete feature, (not necessarily up-to-date with develop); - In such case, latest compatible release; - Mature feature (not necessarily complete); - Test feature, still under consideration; - Test feature, discontinued; - Old feature / unknown status; - Can the branch be deleted?. This information would be very valuable, as maybe some people would be interested in continuing old developments, some repetitive work would also be avoided, and collaboration between complementary branches would be enhanced.

Availability,"Hi all, . this is the continuation of #1242 . Change of the `enum`'s in `option_structure.hpp` into `enum class`. This has the benefit of no implicit conversion to int and therefore increased safety with the enum type -> [c++ core guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#enum3-prefer-class-enums-over-plain-enums). If you want to sponsor a commit (which I highly recommend ;) ) then a good approach is to ; 1. make your `enum` of choice an `enum class` and remove the associated numbers. ; 2. Rename here if reasonable, i,.e. `ENUM_INLET_TYPE` can be just `INLET_TYPE`. Also the option names to not be redundant so e.g. `INLET_TYPE::PRESSURE_INLET_TYPE` could become `INLET_TYPE::PRESSURE`; 3. Add a `NONE` or `NO_THING` option if needed. Often the global `NONE` option is and that made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move 🧙 ; 2. then you go to `CConfig.c/hpp` and change the option type and everything there (because in the `CConfig` class the variable is usually defined). Find the `GetKind_yourOption` and search the code base for that `Get` function.; 3. Once all search results and the following function bodies are changed just compile and fix until the code builds; 4. Special care for switch statements: If not all options are present make a `default; break;` line -> otherwise the automated builds will fail on a warning (clang is used, I found gcc does only complain with an additional flag); 4. commit at best just 1 commit with a clear message and push. That makes reverting easier if it fails and introduced some non-obvious error; ; Have fun :). ## Related Work; #1242. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"Hi, . I have been running a simulation with CGNS mesh format from the provided test cases using the last version, SU2 - 3.2.0.

In 2D incompressible cases, the number of conservative variables is 3, so nVar = 3 and the size of Jacobian should be 3x3. The codes `Jacobian_i[nDim+1][0]` has memory acess error.; Obviously, the codes are for compressible problems. Can you fix the bug ?

A better way would be:. `mpi_Command = 'mpirun %s'`. but then I get the following error:. ```; File ""/home/baigan/SU2/bin/SU2/run/interface.py"", line 277, in build_command; the_Command = mpi_Command % (processes,the_Command); TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting; ```. I see in interface.py that using srun was the way SU2 was expected to run on SLURM. But since it doesn't I am curious what is the way other people are running if they use SLURM.

Do all the computations of flux jacobians etc. formulated in terms of gamma already rely on the ideal gas (or polytropic) assumption? . Is this sort of thing considered unimportant since SU2 is mainly intended for aerodynamics or would it be too demanding for the solver to converge reliably?. To give a ""simple"" example where this would be useful: A converging-diverging nozzle expanding the refrigerant r134a from around 24 bar to 3 bar. Only if gamma is set to the throat value the choked flow rate will be fairly correctly predicted but the outlet temperature will then be very far below the isentropic 1D result with a real EoS.

Availability,"I believe there's a sign error in how the Jacobian of the viscous fluxes is computed for ideal gases. If you're not familiar with the code, there are two variants: one for ideal gases, and one for arbitrary equations of state. The code for ideal gases is not consistent with the code for arbitrary gas laws. In ``CNumerics::GetViscousProjJacs`` for the ideal gas law you'll find:; ; val_Proj_Jac_Tensor_i[4][0] += factor*proj_viscousflux_vel;; val_Proj_Jac_Tensor_j[4][0] += factor*proj_viscousflux_vel;. In ``CNumerics::GetViscousProjJacs`` for arbitrary gas laws you'll find:. val_Proj_Jac_Tensor_i[4][0] -= factor*proj_viscousflux_vel;; val_Proj_Jac_Tensor_j[4][0] -= factor*proj_viscousflux_vel;. The term is added for ideal gases, but subtracted for non-ideal gases. After deriving the Jacobian myself and having a colleague check my work, I believe that the form for arbitrary gas laws is correct. The ideal-gas law variant seems to be incorrect. Moreover, the code in `GetViscousProjJacs` could use some cleanup.

Availability,"I did a couple of changes to the discrete adjoint implementation. Despite the necessary changes in the iteration structure, the following things have been changed/added:; - It is now possible to compute Pressure, Mach and AoA sensitivities (similar to the continuous adjoint), along with this I modified the screen output.; - The computation of the geometry sensitivities is now split from the adjoint iteration itself (this saves a lot of memory and is much faster). However, this also means that geometry sensitivities are only updated just before the solution files are written.; - In some places in the code you may find the macro AD_BEGIN_PASSIVE and AD_END_PASSIVE. Everything in between is not recorded (called passive section). This is currently used for sections that are related to the construction of the flow Jacobian, since we assume that this Matrix does not depend on the flow solution, i.e. is constant. This is of course not true and leads to a very small error (~0.05% for a flow residual of 10^-4) in the sensitivities, but also increases performance a lot. Then there is a small change in solver_direct_mean.cpp:; - I moved the computation of the primitive variables in the Preprocessing routine into a separate routine (SetPrimitive_Variables). This way it is easier and there is less overhead when computing the coupling of the flow and turbulent variables needed in the discrete adjoint solver.

This specifically applies to CHT multizone computations, but not only. **Describe the solution you'd like**; The energy balance should take care about delta enthalpy between inlet(s) and outlet(s). That can be compared to the heat transferred across the wall(s). So in a steady simulation with one inlet, one outlet and a wall the balance global balance should be zero. When working e.g. on a heat exchanger designs could also be compared with respect to their performance (e.g. NTU numbers or similar). This could be specifically interesting for multizone examples. Further that should work for steady, unsteady, open/closed domains and also consider technical work (as in the case of turbomachinery). ; Essentially it is an output request that should reflect the first law of thermodynamics (including open, transient systems and technical work).; It would help in engineering assessment, convergence control and be a check when new features are implemented. **Example**.

Availability,"I noticed there was a lot of duplicate code in the turbulent numerics files (`numerics_structure.hpp` and `numerics_direct_turbulent.cpp`). Since I'm working with new model equations for hybrid RANS/LES, I didn't want to add to the technical debt. So I decided to refactor the turbulence numerics using the [template design pattern](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/template_method). Basically, I moved common behavior for the viscous and the upwinding residuals to respective base classes and then left the specifics of each model to derived classes. I did my best to not change any of the underlying behavior. The source residual calculations for SST and SA have little in common. I did not apply the template design pattern to them. I named the template classes `CUpwSca_Abstract` and `CAvgGrad_Abstract` because the `_Template` suffix was already taken. I also noticed that there were almost no difference between the old `CAvgGrad_` classes and the `CAvgGradCorrected_` classes. The gradient correction is such a small change that it's better to have a single class with a switch than two classes that are about 95% similar. So I added a boolean property and logical switching if correction is to be applied to the gradients. This boolean parameter is now a parameter for the constructor. Overall, these changes trim down a lot of duplicate code (40% of the lines in `numerics_direct_turbulent.cpp`).

Availability,"I propose adding a unit-testing framework and unit-tests to SU2. After chatting with @economon, I've decided to move the discussion here to get additional input. ## What is unit testing?. For those not familiar with unit testing, unit testing allows the testing of small bits of behavior, ideally using isolated bits of code. It is not intended to replace validation testing or formal verification tests. Instead, it serves a unique purpose. Consider the three following use cases:. + You're developing a new feature, and you want to test it to see if it works. You could do a full simulation, but that takes a lot of time and computing power. You want to check if your new behavior behaves as you suspect before you throw a lot of resources at it.; + You submit a PR and discover that one of the regression tests has failed. But...why? You know that something is broken, but its hard to track down what broke. You want more granular test coverage that can demonstrate what broke.; + You are fixing a very small bug. You know that you should prove that your bug fix worked, but it doesn't seem logical to dedicate an entire validation case to one small bug fix. You want to write a small test for a small fix. In all of these cases, unit testing fills a unique role. Unit testing increases time spent in development, but decreases the amount of time spent in bug-fixing and maintaining. For more information, see this [relevant Stack Exchange question.](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/206/is-it-worthwhile-to-write-unit-tests-for-scientific-research-codes). ## What do I propose?. Our research group at UT Austin has implemented a unit testing framework on our branch, which we're happy with. Some choices were arbitrary, and some choices were made based on our development environment. Those choices may be different for other groups. Here's what we have done:. The unit testing framework is compiled and run using autotools.

Availability,"In keeping with our open-source philosophy, the SU2 webpage should be open and modifiable by all members of the community, just like the rest of the code. This will make it much easier to manage and improve in the long run with distributed effort. As a first step to accomplish this, we are taking advantage of GitHub Pages (https://pages.github.com) in order to host our current SU2 page. A new repository has been created within the SU2 GitHub organization here:. https://github.com/su2code/su2code.github.io. and it contains a copy of the current webpage located at http://su2.stanford.edu with all necessary modifications to links, data, etc. so that it functions correctly and independently. The files on the master branch of that new repository are automatically hosted for us by GitHub here (for free):. https://su2code.github.io. All developers now have access to this repository, and in the future, we can all collaborate together to keep it updated and modernize it. An important note is that GitHub allows for custom domain names to be applied to this website, allowing us to use a "".org"" domain name instead of https://su2code.github.io in the future, once available (https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/). As for next steps, I would like to use this PR to invite discussion about this.

Availability,"Let me begin by saying ""Thank you so, so much for your time and efforts to write SU2 and then distribute as open source!"" . I now wish to make a complaint -- as far as I can tell there is not even a command manual for SU2. I think this should be a requirement for SU2. Tutorials are not enough:. > SU2 includes strict error checking of the config file upon execution of one of the C++ modules. For example, the code **will throw errors if unknown options are specified**, options appear more than once, extra text appears outside of comments, etc. A user should be able to reference a single document to find command syntax and options. As an excercise, I ""tried"" to use a dd-ilut preconditioner with 2 submatrices, symmetric overlap, a drop-tolerance of 1e-4, and a fill of 1.3, with a GMRES solver utilizing a modified Gram-Schmidt orthoganolization, kspace of 30, and RCM reordering... SU2 failed. Ok, so I didn't _actually_ try to do this, but if I were to try this how would I know SU2 _couldn't_ use this? To fill in this exercise I accessed the Trilinos Aztec User Manual: https://trilinos.org/oldsite/packages/aztecoo/AztecOOUserGuide.pdf which, while it doesn't attempt to tell me _what_ a krylov subspace is, at least tells me that I can and how to use the argument _AZ_kspace_. Then as a user I can google _GMRES kspace_ to find the theory / explanation if I so choose. Can this be a thing?

The two repositories contain the same directory structure for the test cases, with complementary (not overlapping) file sets. The responsibility is on the developer to add files to both repositories (in matching directory locations) when adding new test cases. This makes it very easy for one to recombine the full set of files or for Travis CI to do this automatically. To run the test cases locally, one might do the following (assuming paths are set correctly so SU2_CFD is available):. ```; $ git clone https://github.com/su2code/SU2.git; $ git clone https://github.com/su2code/TestCases.git; $ cd SU2/; $ ./configure; $ make install; $ cp -R ../TestCases/* ./TestCases/; $ cd ./TestCases/; $ python serial_regression.py; ```. These commits also include the proper .gitignore additions to make sure that the SU2 repo isn't contaminated with test case outputs, along with the necessary changes to the Travis CI .yml file.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/190:904,avail,available,904,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/190,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"Several bugs have been fixed in the grid deformation and the config file have been updated. . In particular, the inverse volume method uses now an element volume computed in ComputeDeforming_Element_Volume (not the incomplete determinant computed in FEM). fabs have been added to the determinant in the final evaluation of the FEM stiffness matrix (depending on the element orientation, the determinant was negative). The formulation Mu = E / (2.0_(1.0 + Nu)), Lambda = Nu_E/((1.0+Nu)_(1.0-2.0_Nu)) is used instead of the basic simplification Mu = E, Lambda = -E. We can recover that formulation using a large number for Nu (DEFORM_COEFF). The code has been simplified and that IO is now more clear.

In this issue I consider compressible flow around a circle at Re=1e6, Mach=0.15, using the SST turbulence model. The radial mesh has a boundary layer at the circle of radius 1 (adiabatic wall), and a ""boundary-layer-like"" structure around a circle of radius (approximately) 4. Having this ""boundary-layer-like"" structure does not make sense here, but in our project we later want to change the area `1<=radius<=4` to a ""porous material"" zone and this would introduce a boundary layer there.

Availability,"There is an issue for time accurate simulations with multi-stage time integration schemes in combination with multiple (fluid) zones. The reason is that the loop over the multiple (usually Runge-Kutta) stages takes place in the function CMultiGridIntegration::MultiGrid_Cycle, while the loop over the zones is carried out in the drivers. Hence the loop over the (Runge-Kutta) stages takes place inside the loop over the multiple zones. This is fundamentally wrong and will lead to at most 1st order accuracy in time. Hence, the sequence of these loops should be reversed. In principle there are two ways to do this, namely moving the loop over the Runge-Kutta stages up in the hierarchy, or moving the loop over the zones down. I think the former option is undesirable, because this means that all the details of the different time integration schemes must be moved to the driver, which does not improve readability (to say the least). Furthermore, it leads to serious problems when more advanced time integration schemes (with time accurate local time stepping) are employed. So therefore, in my opinion, the only practical solution is to move the loop over the zones downwards in the hierarchy. This leads to significant changes in the implementation, but does this lead to a fundamental problem for any of the applications of SU2?. Thanks,.

Availability,"There seems to potentially be a bug with doing an unsteady dual-timestepping simulation without a provided initial condition (restart file):. When no restart file is provided, the first inner iterations have Time_Iter=0 and Cur_Time=0 (the state **before** these inner iterations). After completion of this time iteration, a file `flow_00000.vtu` and all others are outputted. These files are _not_ the initial condition as specified by the configuration file -- they seem to actually be the solution after the first time step. This can be reproduced easily in the config file I have attached to this issue (an updated version of TestCases/plunging_naca0012 for SU2 v8). The `flow_00000.vtu` file has non-uniform flowfields, which doesn't make sense. For simulations where a restart file like `restart_00000.dat` is provided, the Time_Iter=1 and Cur_Time=dt (the state **after** these inner iterations), and the subsequently outputted files have the correct time iteration appended to it. I think that for non-restart unsteady simulations, the IC should be outputted as solely just the initialization before any inner iterations are completed, Time_Iter++ and Cur_Time+=dt, and THEN inner iterations performed.

Availability,This is a small fix of two bugs related to the viscous axisymmetric source terms. 1. As I had suspected in #1106 it should be `AxiAuxVar_Grad_i[2][0]` instead of `AxiAuxVar_Grad_i[2][1]`. The book by Hoffman that was used as a reference actually contained an error. I am attaching a page from another edition of the book (thanks to @dbrezgin). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55834287/107231504-aaae9d00-6a20-11eb-8a82-b169dd941d81.png). 2. The type for the auxvar and gradient fields should be a reference `auto&` not just `auto`. i found the bug after it was pointed out to me that it was always set to zero (thanks to @dbrezgin).,MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1192:259,error,error,259,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1192,1,['error'],['error']

The regression tests did not catch this error - because the error occurs during postprocessing, and the regression test checks values obtained prior to that step, the regressions appear to pass in this case.

Availability,"This pull request enlarges the capability of SU2 to simulate internal flows in turbomachinery. The flow solver is now capable of performing 3D steady multi-zone simulations via a 3D Non-Reflecting Mixing Plane. The implementation is based on the work done by Saxer and Giles (available at https://doi.org/10.2514/3.23618). To adapt the implementation of Saxer and Giles to an unstructured vertex-based solver such as SU2, a new data structure, called **_CTurboVertex_**, was created for the inflow and outflow boundaries. The **_CTurboVertex_** class is a child of the class **_CVertex_**; thus, it maintains all the standard vertex properties. However, more than a standard vertex, the turboVertex posses:. 1. the possibility of accessing the inflow and outflow boundaries on a span-wise manner (to impose different values of the mixing-plane condition along the blade-height) and on a pitch-wise ordered manner (to compute the Spatial Fourier Transformation of the outgoing characteristics at the boundary for the non-reflectivity). 2. embedded information on what kind of turbomachinery architecture is being simulated, so that the values of velocity at the boundaries can be imposed using the correct frame of reference. So in a nutshell the flow solver is now capable of:. - simulating single 2D/3D turbomachinery blades using 1D characteristic-based BC or Non reflecting BC; - simulating multi-stage 2D/3D turbomachinery via a Mixing-Plane interface, including also the mixing of the turbulent quantities; - handling any kind of turbomachinery architecture (AXIAL, CENTRIFUGAL, CENTRIPETAL and mixed such as CENTRIPETAL_AXIAL or AXIAL_CENTRIFUGAL); - selecting 2 different kind of interpolation methods for the mixing-plane interface: LINEAR_INTERPOLATION and NEAREST_NEIGHBOR; - handling an unlimited number of blades/stages —> (zones); - simulating turbomachinery which works on the NICFD regime such as supercritical CO2 compressors or Organic Rankine Cycle turbines.; - printing history_x.da",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/413:276,avail,available,276,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/413,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"This pull requests adds a capability for multi-objective adjoint evaluation. ; In order to use this capability, a matching number of objectives and surface markers on which to evaluate those objectives, as well as weighting values for each objective must be set. This also works with the python optimization tools, where a flag (COMBINE_OBJECTIVE) determines whether the gradients will be evaluated with a single combined adjoint evaluation or with separate, sequential evaluations. . Option Syntax:; For use with shape_optimization.py:; OPT_OBJECTIVE = DRAG*1.0; LIFT*2.0 ; COMBINE_OBJECTIVE = YES; For use with continuous_adjoint, SU2_CFD, etc, or automatically set by the shape_optimization script:; OBJECTIVE = DRAG, LIFT; OBJECTIVE_WEIGHT = 1.0, -2.0; (Note: opt_objective is still effected by automatically-applied signs - that is, whatever scale is applied to lift will be *-1 to make it a maximization problem. User can now reverse that sign if desired.); In either case, MARKER_MONITORING =( drag_surface, lift_surface); If only one surface is specified, it will automatically be the surface for all objectives listed. Different objectives on different surfaces can also be applied, using lists of the same length. . This change required moving some scaling terms - which means that in one of the test cases the values changed because a scaling factor is moved within the boundary conditions rather than applied after the fact (the final gradient result is the same). In addition to allowing the adjoint for a weighted sum of objectives, this may theoretically allow for applying a numerically convenient scaling factor in the future - ie, in cases where the boundary terms are either too large or too small and cause numerical cancellation errors. .

Availability,"We have used SU2 and SU2-NEMO to predict the heat flux for various shapes in a high-speed flow. Something we have observed is that SU2 requires an extremely small first cell spacing to get an accurate and grid-independent prediction for heat flux. For example, this first cell space is often 1E-9 to 1E-10 m with SU2; whereas with other codes it is a micrometer. The latter is in line with the general rule of thumb of setting the first cell height so that the first cell Reynold's number is between 0.1 and 1.0. Discussing with @jtneedels and @WallyMaier, we think it may have to do with how the temperature gradient is calculated in CNSSolver.cpp:. /*--- Compute the normal gradient in temperature using Twall ---*/. ` su2double dTdn = -(There - Twall)/dist_ij;`. /*--- Apply a weak boundary condition for the energy equation.; Compute the residual due to the prescribed heat flux. ---*/. ` su2double Res_Conv = 0.0;; su2double Res_Visc = thermal_conductivity * dTdn * Area;`. which may result in a first-order approximation for the temperature gradient causing this requirement for an extremely small cell size to recover the true gradient. I would be interested to see if calculating this gradient similar to CFVMFlowSolverBase.ini.

Using SA turbulence model, this behaviour is not shown. It looks like the tubulent kinetic energy field affect the computation of pressure field, leading to a non zero gradient pressure at wall, as shown in the attached figures:. In the figures it can be seen a comparison between the in-house solver of the Italian Aerospace Research Center (CIRA), where SST model is implemented, and SU2 using both available turbulence models, SST and SA. The isolines represent the pressure field and the contour is the TKE field obtained with SU2 with SST. In particular, solid red line is CIRA solver, the solid black line is SU2-SST, and dashed black line is SU2-SA. Near the LE where TKE is 0, the isolines are similar and 0 pressure gradient at the wall is obtained with both turbulence models. When TKE starts to grow, the pressure computed with SU2-SST shows a non constant behaviour and at the wall has non 0 gradient. Furthermore, in the wake region the defect is more evident.

Building v7.5.1 on Linux (Slackware 15.0) installs three subdirectories to /usr/bin:. /usr/bin/FSI_tools/; /usr/bin/SU2/; /usr/bin/SU2_Nastran/. These appear to be Python modules. Is this install location intended? Perhaps I missed an important build step. The difficulty is that this conflicts with the Linux filesystem hierarchy: ""4.4.2: There must be no subdirectories in /usr/bin."". https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch04s04.html. ... and results in complaints when building e.g. a Slackbuild package. In any event, /usr/bin is not where Python modules belong. Minor problem, I know, but the fix is probably pretty easy: Install these modules using pip. I believe pip is supposed to know the correct place to install modules. For example, on my system, pip installs them to /usr/lib64/python<version>/site-packages, which seems to be on the default module search path. Side benefit: one can dispense with setting SU2_RUN and PYTHONPATH in ~/.bashrc. And PATH in any event, since /usr/bin should already be in the path except in rare cases.

Similarly, SU2_DOT_AD behaved in the same manner even if adjoint solution was tightly converged. To exclude any non-dependency from the objective function, different options were investigated (DRAG, LIFT, SURFACE_MACH, SURFACE_TOTAL_PRESSURE, ENTROPY_GENERATION) and nothing changed. Moreover, the vaned diffuser scenario (_not visualized in here for simplicity_) seems to be affected too, even if very similar to basic flow scenarios (_basically, it is just an internal 3D-flow over airfoil case_). I thought this behavior could be traced to a bug since my previous mesh deformation always proceeded smoothly (_from flow past cylinder to other internal flow scenarios_), either with arbitrary or gradient based deformation. However, none of these were investigated with turbomachinery settings, which are necessary for this scenario for two main reasons:. 1. post processing parameters computed by SU2; 6. this mesh is part of a turbomachinery multi-block simulation. **To reproduce**; [config.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/11416238/config.txt) -> cfg file; [mesh_out.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/11416239/mesh_out.txt) -> mesh (_FFD box attached_).

Availability,"` to be set properly. However, in the FEM/DG solver, the `base_nodes` is defaulted to `nullptr` and we have workarounds in the FEM/DG sovler that does not require a call to `GetNodes()` in other parts of the code (we use elements instead of nodes, so the concept of nodes is not really well-defined in the FEM/DG solver). . At the moment, the develop branch will fail at this line if anyone attempts to use the FEM/DG solver. . E.g., Taking the `hom_euler/NACA0012_5thOrder` test case in the repo gives the following error message:; ```SU2_CFD: ../SU2_CFD/src/output/../../include/solvers/CSolver.hpp:230: const CVariable* CSolver::GetNodes() const: Assertion `base_nodes!=nullptr && ""CSolver::base_nodes was not set properly, see brief for CSolver::SetBaseClassPointerToNodes()""' failed.``` at the pre-processing stage before any computation is done. Hence, a conditional operator is added to avoid this call for DG solvers. ## Related Work; *Resolve any issues (bug fix or feature request), note any related PRs, or mention interactions with the work of others, if any.*; @vdweide and I are working on a new version of the DG solver that needs this workaround anyway. This is just added for now in case anyone else wants to work on the current version of DG solver available. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"and cost. A better technique is required which provides reasonably good accuracy without increasing the computation time and costs much. Vorticity confinement technique is a proven procedure that helps in reducing numerical diffusion offered by the scheme. Results from the literature shows that using the vorticity confinement technique, a better resolution is achieved in the problems like flow behind bluff bodies, rotors, wings etc. References. J.

Refactor SU2_GEO such that all its functionality can be performed in python (in progress); 2. Add a generalized thickness constraint (in progress); 3. Be able to do multiple types of geometry evaluation (for example wing+fuselage); 4. Expose some of the mesh deformation functions to python to allow for robust design variable definition; 5. Perform all of the shape optimization using the in-memory python scripts; 6. Intelligent handling of solution divergences that doesn't break the optimization; 7. Better way to define multipoint optimizations; 8. Better multi-objective optimization definition (#913 might be helpful in this); 9. Simplify the multitude of shape optimization options (#733). As you can probably tell, a lot of my examples and motivations revolve around aerospace applications. So while I try and make a general framework that is robust, I might not be thinking in a broad enough fashion. I would love to get input from the community for any functionality that they might want to see in this framework. The more robust this is, the more widely useful it will be. I am also a newbie to the python wrapper world of SU2. If there are any glaring road blocks or things that have been tried before but failed, please let me know. ; ; ## Related Work; #733 . ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"d JST scheme (these are the two options I have tested). It is possible to resolve this error by simply moving the stopping of the preaccumulation region from before the call to `updateLinearSystem` in the `ComputeFlux` method of both these schemes, to after, as show below. `/*--- Update the vector and system matrix. ---*/. updateLinearSystem(iEdge, iPoint, jPoint, implicit, updateType,; updateMask, flux, jac_i, jac_j, vector, matrix);. /*--- Stop preaccumulation. ---*/. stopPreacc(flux);`. However, whilst this resolve the error in this location, the next error appears in the Giles boundary condition. Here the two jacobian components within the residual object are not recorded correctly in the preaccumulation output region also. This in `CEulerSolver.cpp:6556`. `/*--- Compute the residual using an upwind scheme ---*/; auto residual = conv_numerics->ComputeResidual(config);. /*--- Update residual value ---*/; LinSysRes.AddBlock(iPoint, residual);`. I have tried simpy adding these components as preacc outputs however they are SIMD arrays and the datatype cannot be converted using the existing implementation. . I am not sure what is going on here, or the next steps to resolve this problem.

Availability,"d compressible) viscous fluxes are considered in the symmetry plane boundary condition. In both codes the BC_sym_plane links directly to Euler_Wall. . Compressible: A ""reflected state"" approach is done. Create a reflected halo node which enforces symmetry and compute the occurring flux just as in the interior. Problem: the primitive gradients are not adapted nor a viscous flux based on that is computed. Incompressible: Here a ""direct flux"" approach is chosen in Euler Wall. Insert the symmetry conditions directly in the FV derivation on the boundary part and thereby eliminate most terms. For the convective terms only a pressure contribution in the momentum equation remains. No Viscous terms are currently considered which is not correct for the momentum equation. . For both solvers I implemented a ""reflected state"" approach in C*Solver::BC_sym_plane as I didn't want to touch the Euler_wall implementations especially from the compressible solver. . I (informally) wrote a bit down as explanation in Latex how I did the derivation.; [Symmetry_BC.pdf](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/2891210/Symmetry_BC.pdf); Note that in the DG-FEM solver of @vdweide the same ""reflected state"" approach is implemented although it is not clear to me how the derivation was done there. See the bottom of the pdf for more info. I would be happy to get some insight here :).

Availability,"dient method (unweighted least squares recommended), which is very important for robustness. Gradients for viscous terms and sources are still computed via GG or WLS for accuracy reasons.; - SA model was being clipped unnecessarily. This clipping has been removed. Here is my recommendation on how to run all of your 2nd-order cases going forward:. ### Euler / Laminar N-S; Turn off the limiters, unless you truly need them for preserving solution monotonicity (e.g., for shocks/discontinuities). Use ; ```; NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON= LEAST_SQUARES; ```; for robustness. Start with a CFL around 10 and converge the implicit system with LINEAR_SOLVER_ITER= 10 for each nonlinear iteration (FGMRES + ILU0 recommended). Activate the CFL adaption with. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down, factor up, CFL min value,; % CFL max value ); CFL_ADAPT= YES; CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.1, 2.0, 10.0, 1e10); ```. It is important that the linear solve behaves well for each nonlinear iteration, so if this does not converge immediately, adjust the tolerance or number of linear iterations. Roe seems very stable, but some of the other upwind schemes or centered schemes may require improved Jacobian accuracy (to recover fast convergence) with:. ```; USE_ACCURATE_FLUX_JACOBIANS= YES; CENTRAL_JACOBIAN_FIX_FACTOR= 4.0; ```. ### RANS; Due to the segregated approach for the turbulence models, you have to be more conservative with the CFL adaption. All else is the same as above, but I recommend. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down, factor up, CFL min value,; % CFL max value ); CFL_ADAPT= YES; CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.1, 1.2, 10.0, 1e3); ```. Most inviscid/laminar cases that I have tested so far converge to machine precision within a couple of hundred iterations. RANS cases within a few thousand. Ultra fine RANS meshes can still slow things down (MG could help there), but otherwise, speedups of an order of magnitude (or more) are possible for most problems.

Availability,"econditioner, and matrix-vector product) have a single template parameter, the data type (which can be passivedouble or su2double). There are no provisions for ""mixed"" arithmetic, except in CSysSolve where through ::Solve (and only through ::Solve) one can ask for the solution of a system with passive Jacobian and active RHS and solution (this is possible at the expense of temporaries that are allocated only once). Passive-Passive and Active-Active work without temporaries and Active-Passive is not supported as it does not make sense (see end of previous paragraph). This is to keep the need for template specialization to a minimum. Wherever mixing types was necessary small helper methods were defined to provide the compatibility instead of specializing larger methods, I think this keeps the code readable. The place where passive and active types mix the most is CSysMatrix. This happens because the blocks are prepared by the numerics in **su2double and are then ""Set"", ""Add"", or ""Subtract"", on a CSysMatrix<passivedouble>. The solution was to inline those routines and template them also for the data type of the block (or diagonal). I only tested on one fluid adjoint and one FSI adjoint case (fingers cross not to fail too many tests). ## Related Work; #594 Does not help with memory much but helps with speed.; #648 Makes it easier to interface with an external solver and still work with the discrete adjoint.; #650 Builds on top of what is proposed there.; #543 These MKL optimizations will now be possible for the discrete adjoint but I have not made them available yet.; Branch *feature_template_linear_solver*. ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [X] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/653:2052,avail,available,2052,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/653,1,['avail'],['available']

Two other aspects.; 1. the PRESSURE_DROP OF is computed in streamwise periodic flow using the Recovered_Pressure (as the ""standard"" Pressure is the same on both faces). There I need to make sure that the recovered values are computed as well after the iteration (but with the Flow Preprocessing after the MultiGridCycle that seems to be the case); 2. As pressure drop is iterated to get the correct flow solution, is it necessary to treat is specially in the adjoint like a solution variable? <- turns out, that was the case and also is the majority of work done in this PR.

Availability,"for a long time. I fairly recently set up a 4 machine cluster (16 cores each) to run CFD problems on. The cluster is connected together with 1G ethernet. On SU2 v6.2 and earlier, when I ran a problem on multiple machines the time per iteration would improve up until i hit a limit where presumably network overhead exceeded the benefit of adding another machine (The limit for my set up was something like 0.5 s/iteration. . I just tried SU2 v7 on this same cluster and consistently the time per iteration gets worse when I add a second machine and double the process count. I've tried this on smaller problems (~1Mill cells) but I've also tried it on larger ones (~27Million cells). On the larger problem, one machine with 16 processes ran at 34s/iteration and 2 machines with 32 processes also ran at 34s/iteration. For that problem size, I would expect a near 2x improvement in iteration time when doubling processes. Other than this, the apples to apples comparison between SU2 v6 and v7 is otherwise very impressive where iteration times have come down even for higher CFL's. I did compile SU2 from source. I tried to compile it the same way for both v6.2 and v7 though with the different build system its a little bit harder to be certain that its all exactly the same. Given that v7 performs fine going up to 16 processes on one machine, I don't think that its a compilation issue, but admittedly I don't know all the intricacies of mpi. . Since its just multi machine that's an issue, I wonder if there's something about v7 that make it more bandwidth/latency dependent that would go away with a faster network. Or is this just a regression do to (compiler version, mpi version, a network misconfiguration...)?. Anyway I know this a bit rambling, but any help would be appreciated.

Availability,"for accuracy reasons.; - SA model was being clipped unnecessarily. This clipping has been removed. Here is my recommendation on how to run all of your 2nd-order cases going forward:. ### Euler / Laminar N-S; Turn off the limiters, unless you truly need them for preserving solution monotonicity (e.g., for shocks/discontinuities). Use ; ```; NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON= LEAST_SQUARES; ```; for robustness. Start with a CFL around 10 and converge the implicit system with LINEAR_SOLVER_ITER= 10 for each nonlinear iteration (FGMRES + ILU0 recommended). Activate the CFL adaption with. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down, factor up, CFL min value,; % CFL max value ); CFL_ADAPT= YES; CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.1, 2.0, 10.0, 1e10); ```. It is important that the linear solve behaves well for each nonlinear iteration, so if this does not converge immediately, adjust the tolerance or number of linear iterations. Roe seems very stable, but some of the other upwind schemes or centered schemes may require improved Jacobian accuracy (to recover fast convergence) with:. ```; USE_ACCURATE_FLUX_JACOBIANS= YES; CENTRAL_JACOBIAN_FIX_FACTOR= 4.0; ```. ### RANS; Due to the segregated approach for the turbulence models, you have to be more conservative with the CFL adaption. All else is the same as above, but I recommend. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down, factor up, CFL min value,; % CFL max value ); CFL_ADAPT= YES; CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.1, 1.2, 10.0, 1e3); ```. Most inviscid/laminar cases that I have tested so far converge to machine precision within a couple of hundred iterations. RANS cases within a few thousand. Ultra fine RANS meshes can still slow things down (MG could help there), but otherwise, speedups of an order of magnitude (or more) are possible for most problems. Experiment yourselves.. sometimes you can get even more performance, sometimes less, case depending.

So in a nutshell the flow solver is now capable of:. - simulating single 2D/3D turbomachinery blades using 1D characteristic-based BC or Non reflecting BC; - simulating multi-stage 2D/3D turbomachinery via a Mixing-Plane interface, including also the mixing of the turbulent quantities; - handling any kind of turbomachinery architecture (AXIAL, CENTRIFUGAL, CENTRIPETAL and mixed such as CENTRIPETAL_AXIAL or AXIAL_CENTRIFUGAL); - selecting 2 different kind of interpolation methods for the mixing-plane interface: LINEAR_INTERPOLATION and NEAREST_NEIGHBOR; - handling an unlimited number of blades/stages —> (zones); - simulating turbomachinery which works on the NICFD regime such as supercritical CO2 compressors or Organic Rankine Cycle turbines.; - printing history_x.dat file for multi-zone convergence monitoring; - printing some post-processing thermodynamic, kinematic and geometric quantities in some files inside a TURBOMACHINERY folder. The limitations of the turbomachinery capabilities are:. - the axis of rotation should be always the Z one; - MGL acceleration technique is not working because of some un-resolved issues with the periodic BC. This pull request introduce also some limited design capability for turbomachinery applications. Using the AD tool, it is now available on the suite also a single zone discrete adjoint to compute the sensitivity for 2D/3D turbomachinery blade with respect to certain performance parameters (ENTROPY_GENERATION, TOTAL_PRESSURE_LOSS, KINETIC_ENERGY_LOSS, ecc.). However, the optimization script only works for 2D blades since the FFD and the mesh deformation routines need still to be adapted to handle 3D blades (especially for problem on the deformation of the hub and shroud surfaces).",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/413:2510,avail,available,2510,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/413,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"gs mentioned above. However, the current implementation in develop only works correctly for PARAVIEW_MULTIBLOCK and for RESTART type output files. This is because in the case of PARAVIEW_MULTIBLOCK, the additional file output using the iteration number in the filename, is performed in the switch case block directly. . For all other output files, the switch case block only generates the correct filename with the iteration number appended. After the switch block, it is (wrongly) checked if (and only if) the WRT_RESTART_OVERWRITE flag is set to NO. If so, the additional file is written. Therefore, this logic only works correctly for RESTART files (and PARAVIEW_MULTIBLOCK files, because for that format, the file dump is independent of the file dump after the switch block. . The proposed fix here introduces a local boolean (doWriteIterFile) that acts as a switch for the additional file dump. It is set in the switch case block and afterwards it is checked if this variable is true or false. Based on this value, the file dump is executed or not. Furthermore, the fix introduces and corrects some comments to make the function easier to understand. ## Related Work; The flags are already available in the develop branch as config options but they don't work as expected. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"https://github.com/su2code/SU2/assets/116454159/4d04287e-b111-45b5-96dd-6b9cc5f18217). It appears that there may be either a misunderstanding on my part with the implementation of SST-V2003m w/ MUSCL, or that a bug exists in SU2 for it. I got very unusual and different results when using MUSCL vs. not. To further look into this, I also completed additional simulations using `KIND_TURB_MODEL=SA`, which got me much more reasonable-looking results. Please see the plots below:. ![image](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/assets/116454159/e5d80bbd-9bc2-4f3c-a6e2-bb5dfc43336b); ![image](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/assets/116454159/3804bdf1-7f99-4584-9683-cfbfd7dfa916). Lastly, here is the config file:; [config.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/12155765/M6_LowRe.txt). Note that the ""MUSCL=ON"" in the plots indicate the solution for both `MUSCL_FLOW=YES` and `MUSCL_TURB=YES`. That is the only difference between config files. Also, I tried using `MARKER_RIEMANN`, `MARKER_OUTLET`, and `MARKER_SUPERSONIC_OUTLET` on the outlets with no success on fixing this discrepancy, so I believe it is not related to the boundary conditions. **Bug report checklist**; *Please make sure that you have followed the checklist below, many common problems can be solved by:*. - [X] Consulting the build instructions (https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Build-SU2-Linux-MacOS/).; - [x] Looking for similar problems on GitHub or CFD-Online (https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2/).; - [X] Updating to the newest version of SU2 (either develop, master, or the pre-built executables https://su2code.github.io/download.html). **Desktop (please complete the following information):**; - OS: [e.g., Linux (CentOS 7)]; - C++ compiler and version: GCC 9.1.0; - MPI implementation and version: Intel MPI 19.0.9; - SU2 Version: v7.5.1 but with following additional commits cherry-picked:; - 8ce4c3fd5e030949d037e073e1b4418e51c87540; - 07645b1b70d1dbfcf3d96acfeb10c560532ad60f; - 54af111101f4aab98cc4589e2242d9cd06730618",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2088:2051,down,download,2051,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2088,1,['down'],['download']

The speed of sound always has a slightly high value because TKE is not subtracted. See ""roe.cpp"" line 119 ~ 149. ; `RoeSoundSpeed2 = (Gamma-1)*(RoeEnthalpy-0.5*sq_vel);` ; This line might be changed roughly like : ; `RoeSoundSpeed2 = (Gamma-1)*(RoeEnthalpy-0.5*sq_vel-k);` .

Availability,"in those regions but its still higher than freestream. Increasing the 2nd coefficient also makes the shock resolution in the rest of the flow field very smooth (looks like a smudge on the screen). Is there a reason why this happens? I did a few first order upwind simulations; they converge almost instantly and the higher Mach region does not exist. Nor does it exist in 2nd order upwind scheme, but these dont converge any further than -4. I want to conduct optimisation, for which the JST scheme shows good stability and convergence for adjoint problems. I have uploaded the config file, convergence history and images of the high Mach region around the leading edge here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HtBwS9rVuWn5IJoDpMCCpRyYehOTk9by?usp=drive_link. The history file also contains information of the meshes (number of cells and y+ values). I uploaded one of the converging meshes (v_coarse.su2) and one of the diverging meshes (medium.su2). I used WEIGHTED_LEAST_SQUARES to help with the sharp edge; this decreases the Mach in the region but not by much (~9 for the very_coarse mesh). I have also run the RANS solver with JST, but there is no significant difference from using NS with WEIGHTED_LEAST_SQUARES; the Mach number in the region 8.74.

Availability,"irectories with different configurations (like for a debug build etc); - ninja uses all available cores in your system by default. Still you can set the number of jobs using `-j N`. ### Additional notes; - Meson requires python 3, so implicitly we get this requirement now. But I think it is less of a problem than some of you probably might think. A lot of problems we have come from the fact the we support python 2 and python 3. As I was setting up travis (getting there in a moment) I noticed that is easily possible to compile the code with python 3 (for the python wrapper) and run the python scripts with python 2 and vice versa, which eventually leads to errors and crashes. If we require(!) version 3 (which should be installed on all machines now ...) we can avoid such problems from the beginning. Furthermore, python 2 is deprecated anyway ... - I already changed travis to use the new build system. This as one major advantage: we can now properly use ccache and the caching feature of travis (that means only files that have changed will be compiled if a cache is available). This should speed up the runs by a lot. . - automake and meson can coexist without any problems. Maybe we can keep this compatibility for version 7 and remove it later if we all agree. Also the preconfigure.py should not be necessary anymore then. - (unit) tests can be easily added and integrated into the build process. - I will add a proper documentation soon. ## Related Work; *Resolve any issues (bug fix or feature request), note any related PRs, or mention interactions with the work of others, if any.*. #685 . ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"it testing library for the following reasons:. + It can be included as a header-only library.; + It has a very clean, easy-to-use syntax; + It has widespread use, including the FEniCS library. ### Design choices. The following design choices are in place. If you disagree with them, then please start a discussion here:. + All tests are placed in a root-level directory named `UnitTests`. Inside this directory is a structure just like the existing folder structure (e.g. `SU2_CFD/numerics`), except that there are not separate `src` and `include` folders.; + Tests are grouped by class, and put in files such as `CNumerics_tests.cpp`.; + A single test executable is compiled and run, as opposed to a separate test executable for each group of tests. With the single test executable, you can always filter down to groups of tests or individual tests.; + When `ninja test` or `meson test` is run, the test executable is only run once, sweeping through all the unit tests. The result only shows a single failure or a single success. If more detail is desired, then the test executable can be run manually.; + The relevant SU2 code is compiled as a library (e.g. `libSU2core`) and then linked into both the main executable (`SU2_CFD`) and the test program (`test_driver`). ### How to Run Unit Tests. If you compile SU2 using `ninja -C builddir`, then the test executable will automatically be compiled. You then have three options for running the tests:. + `meson test` (see documentation [here](https://mesonbuild.com/Unit-tests.html)); + `ninja test`; + Run the exectuable manually: `./UnitTests/test_driver`. When running the executable manually, there are many customization options. Run `./UnitTests/test_driver --help` to see them all. ### How to add unit tests. I have already included a single unit-test example (`UnitTests/SU2_CFD/src/numerics/CNumerics_tests.cpp`). Aside from the headaches with CConfig, this example should be clear.

Availability,"it-tests-for-scientific-research-codes). ## What do I propose?. Our research group at UT Austin has implemented a unit testing framework on our branch, which we're happy with. Some choices were arbitrary, and some choices were made based on our development environment. Those choices may be different for other groups. Here's what we have done:. The unit testing framework is compiled and run using autotools. For more information on autotool's setup, see [their documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Tests.html). Since autotools is the build system for SU2, this involves minimal changes. Using automake, the build process for building unit tests becomes:. ```; ./bootstrap; ./configure; make; make check; ```. We use [Boost's unit testing framework](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html). This provides a convenient set of macros for instatiating tests, grouping tests into suites, and running checks. This choice was based on what is available in our development setup. We have integrated our unit tests into our Travis CI regression testing. Every time we push commits or submit a pull request, the unit tests are run and checked. ## What is my vision for unit testing in SU2?. I am *not* proposing that we start trying to get 100% code coverage with pre-existing code. That would not provide a good return on investment. Instead, I see people adding unit tests as they write new code and as they find bugs. For each new behavior added to SU2, tests are first added to document the related existing behavior. These tests serve to check that the existing behavior isn't damaged by the new code. Then new tests are added to prove that the new behavior is working correctly. For bug fixes, the process is simpler. A test is added to confirm that something is not behaving as expected. Then the code is fixed to make the test pass. ## What frameworks are available?. For a unit testing framework, here are the most popular options, with t",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/698:2530,avail,available,2530,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/698,1,['avail'],['available']

""Examination of the shear stress transport assumption with a low-Reynolds number k-omega model for aerodynamic flows."" Eq 17.; - Boundary conditions errors at inlets, following the Issue #1851. A fix has been proposed following @pcarruscag suggestions for the supersonic inlet BC.; - Boundary conditions definitions are different than the ones proposed in TMR. Maybe give the user the choice to use the BCs implemented in SU2 or the ones from TMR. Changes to SST model proposed:; - Inclusion of non modified versions of SST. In this case I think that more work is needed to be sure that the correct terms are taken into account everywhere in the code.; - Give the user the possibility of changing the production limiter for TKE (not essential).; - Change values of default turbulent to laminar viscosity to 1e-2 (NASA TMR reports that it should be in the range of 1e-2 to 1e-5, but in SU2 this is set to 10 as default). . I've seen the proposed changes to the lower limits of k and w in #2323 and I tried implementing it in my branch. However, if the implementation proposed in the respective PR is preferred then I will change mine. . ## Related Work; #2323 ",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2329:1150,error,errors,1150,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2329,1,['error'],['errors']

The solution of TKE is not very sensitive to C_K (assume it is sufficiently low). We recommended:.

Two configurations of CFL adaptation were tested on both the original and modified lower limit code, ; 1. CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.99, 1.005, 5.0, 50.0, 0.0001 ) named max CFL 50 ; 2.

Beyond adding robustness allowing the the use of a CFL of 200 which diverges under the original limit , the modified limit allows for better convergence of the flow and turbulence residuals for CFL of 50. Plots of the Lift and drag Coefficients are added here showing that results are not affected by the new limit, and additionally convergence is slightly quicker for the lift coefficient even with a CFL of 50 . . ![CL](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/assets/139676851/61adc0af-9449-41e8-aac7-e985ca3c9bdb); ![CD](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/assets/139676851/17b877df-7eff-47d4-9a77-95e3ccd2afcd). ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

You can configure multiple directories with different configurations (like for a debug build etc); - ninja uses all available cores in your system by default. Still you can set the number of jobs using `-j N`. ### Additional notes; - Meson requires python 3, so implicitly we get this requirement now. But I think it is less of a problem than some of you probably might think. A lot of problems we have come from the fact the we support python 2 and python 3. As I was setting up travis (getting there in a moment) I noticed that is easily possible to compile the code with python 3 (for the python wrapper) and run the python scripts with python 2 and vice versa, which eventually leads to errors and crashes. If we require(!) version 3 (which should be installed on all machines now ...) we can avoid such problems from the beginning. Furthermore, python 2 is deprecated anyway ... - I already changed travis to use the new build system. This as one major advantage: we can now properly use ccache and the caching feature of travis (that means only files that have changed will be compiled if a cache is available). This should speed up the runs by a lot. . - automake and meson can coexist without any problems. Maybe we can keep this compatibility for version 7 and remove it later if we all agree. Also the preconfigure.py should not be necessary anymore then. - (unit) tests can be easily added and integrated into the build process. - I will add a proper documentation soon. ## Related Work; *Resolve any issues (bug fix or feature request), note any related PRs, or mention int",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/745:2678,error,errors,2678,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/745,1,['error'],['errors']

New versions of the CodeQL analysis are constantly deployed on GitHub.com; your repository will automatically benefit from the most recently released version. #### The analysis doesn’t seem to be working; If you get an error in GitHub Actions that indicates that CodeQL wasn’t able to analyze your code, please [follow the instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/troubleshooting-the-codeql-workflow) to debug the analysis. #### How do I disable LGTM.com?; If you have LGTM’s automatic pull request analysis enabled, then you can [follow these steps to disable the LGTM pull request analysis](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/managing-automated-code-review#disabling-pr-integration). You don’t actually need to remove your repository from LGTM.com; it will automatically be removed in the next few months as part of the deprecation of LGTM.com ([more info here](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/)). #### Which source code hosting platforms does code scanning support?; GitHub code scanning is deeply integrated within GitHub itself.

I went without turbulence for the cht cases to make it simpler. In the past and now we were able to see some good gradient validation against FD. So this issue is not super dramatic (although I am pretty annoyed by that) and I think I simply overlooked it in the past. In case there is sth unclear pls let me know, I'll will try to clarify asap.

Availability,"pers/sobolev.pdf); This is done by solving an elliptic PDE with the sensitivities, i.e., ( e1 Id - e2 Laplace) delta_x = - dF / dx, with different weights e1, e2. Inserting the sensitivities from the discrete adjoint solver for (dF / dx) leads to the gradient in a Sobolev space.; The method can be extended to incorporate the parameterization of the mesh cells x=M(p) with design values p, [see here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15279) Using the projected gradient w.r.t. the design values the systems takes the form; (dM/dp)^T (e1 Id - e2 Laplace) (dM/dp) = - dF/dp. Such treatment can help prevent noise in the derivative computation and leads to smoother design updates. Especially, when working in a One-Shot optimization context.; Here the optimization is done with inexact function values and gradients, i.e., the flow and adjoint solvers are only partially converged between design updates. For this setting simple gradient descent with too large update steps will not work, since a few flow iterations are not enough to recover a solution from the restart file from the last optimization step.; See the graphic below for drag minimization of a NACA 0012 airfoil with constant lift, where the Sobolev solver for the gradient leads to smoother deformations and better optimization.; ![pullrequest1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16785869/143250126-e5bdd360-e265-40ca-9d24-5811ecbb759c.jpg). Application is done as a post-processing step in the SU2_DOT_AD executable.; The new solver constructs the necessary operator and solves it using the features of the finite element implementation in SU2. For this, it uses the same elements as the FEA solver but extends the definitions of the Gauss quadrature to be second order.; It can operate in two different modes:. 1) The smoothing can be applied to the mesh sensitivities, either in the complete mesh or only design boundaries.

For that case it does not create any unwanted sideeffects. The explanatory comment; ```; * The nElm condition is to allow vectors to also be used locally. ---*/; ```; did not really enlighten me. I guess we have `nElm==nElmDomain` if we run without domain decomposition i.e. size=1. And as soon as size>1 `nElm` should be larger than `nElmDomain` as there is communication overhead ... at least how SU2 does it? So maybe the computation of those nElm values is not ok (I will look in that direction).

Availability,"re sophisticated controller for nonlinear iterations along with several other important modifications. The changes are the following:; - New under-relaxation strategy. Variables such as density and energy are only allowed to change by +/- 20% with each nonlinear iteration by applying an under-relaxation parameter to the updates at each node, which helps with difficult transients, especially at calculation startup. Also applied to turbulence model updates (though threshold is larger).; - CFL adaption via an exponential progression with under-relaxation approach, i.e., changes to CFL are coupled to the under-relaxation parameter (small under-relaxation parameter = decrease, and large = increase). CFL is now locally defined for each CV for this process.; - Modified realizability checks to avoid negative density/pressure/temperature at the nodes and also during 2nd-order reconstruction at cell faces.; - CV face states for 2nd-order MUSCL are now optionally reconstructed with a separate gradient method (unweighted least squares recommended), which is very important for robustness. Gradients for viscous terms and sources are still computed via GG or WLS for accuracy reasons.; - SA model was being clipped unnecessarily. This clipping has been removed. Here is my recommendation on how to run all of your 2nd-order cases going forward:. ### Euler / Laminar N-S; Turn off the limiters, unless you truly need them for preserving solution monotonicity (e.g., for shocks/discontinuities). Use ; ```; NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON= LEAST_SQUARES; ```; for robustness. Start with a CFL around 10 and converge the implicit system with LINEAR_SOLVER_ITER= 10 for each nonlinear iteration (FGMRES + ILU0 recommended). Activate the CFL adaption with. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down, factor up, CFL min value,; % CFL max value ); CFL_ADAPT= YES; CFL_ADAPT_PARAM= ( 0.1, 2.0, 10.0, 1e10); ```.

Furthermore the Inlet BC were tried with many different vertical speeds (vx=0/0.001/0.01/0.1/1/10). Simulations with the inlet, farfield and outlet as TOTAL_INLET, FARFIELD, OUTLET and EULER and some (not all) combination between these BC were tried. The mesh was generated with Salome-Meca. It is a tetrahedral mesh. I have a script that permits to change the domain size with ease. So from the mesh perspective it is fairly easy to test different mesh sizes and domain sizes.; Generally the outer domain radius was between 1.5*propRadius to 10*propRadus. Domain height between 3*propRadius to 15*propRadius. The prop was at 2/3 of the total height (1/2 and 3/4 were also tested). Some simulations approximated from a far experimental results (thrust +/-10% error, torque +/-15%). Some completely diverged some converge towards something way out of the 10% error range. **To Reproduce**.

For steps 1 and 4 however, there is no such option: these steps must be executed by a ""command-line call"" in a newly spawned sub-process, as is done in the SU2 Python tools, in `SU2.run.DEF` and `SU2.run.DOT` respectively. However, spawning new -- parallel -- processes using `subprocess` from within an MPI environment is ""dangerous"", besides being rather rude towards workload managers such as Slurm, making this an unviable solution in this kind of application. **Proposed solution**; If at all reasonable, I would like to have the functionality of `SU2_DEF` and `SU2_DOT_AD` exposed to the Python wrappers `pysu2` and `pysu2ad`, ideally using an approach which is consistent with the existing implementation for `SU2_CFD` and `SU2_CFD_AD`. If I understand correctly, this change would require something along the lines of: . - Refactoring the main functions of `SU2_DEF.cpp` and `SU2_DOT_AD.cpp` into new driver classes, e.g. `CDeformationDriver` and `CDiscAdjProjectionDriver`, broken down into pre-processing, execution, output, and postprocessing.; - Exposing these new driver classes to Python through a SWIG `.i` file. Beyond offering a solution to the problem described above, allowing the complete optimisation iteration to be controlled externally (for example by an MDO framework), this might in the long term also allow providing deformations to the `SU2_DEF` routine directly in Python, as an alternative to the surface deformation file. Similarly, the surface sensitivities resulting from `SU2_DOT_AD` could be accessed directly in Python for post-processing. **Alternatives**; The proposed solution is hopefully a starting point for some discussion, should there be interest in the issue. Suggestions which could help with the refinement and implementation of the proposed solution, or any alternative, would be very welcome. **Disclaimer**; Please excuse the long read.

However, it is incomplete and contains very little new information. . **Describe the solution you'd like**; We would like to contribute more to this idea. Specifically, we would like to add. - A description of why slope limiters are used in a FVM formulation. This can explain the concept of Total Variation Diminishing methods, monotonic schemes, and 2nd order accuracy requirements. ; - Mathematically describe the limiters available to the user in SU2. This will include a brief discussion of their properties (e.g., diffusivity, tunable parameters) and potential Sweby plots. ; - An empirical comparison of the available limiters on a test problem(s). One problem that was considered was the laminar cylinder, or the viscous wedge cases. The flowfield colored by the limiter value can be shown to the user. . **Describe alternatives you've considered**; N/A. **Additional context**; This issue ticket is part of an open-source community contribution assignment in our graduate studies ""Numerical Solutions to Partial Differential Equations"".

Unfortunately, given that during this time both #753 and #774 were merged, the tests are failing now. Particularly, the disc_adj_fsi case runs into a segfault in `CDiscAdjSolver::ExtractAdjoint_CrossTerm_Geometry`, when trying to execute ; `geometry->node[iPoint]->GetAdjointCoord(Solution_Geometry);`. . I believe this is related to the changes to the index based recording introduced in #774, as the code was running before into the same problem in `CDiscAdjSolver::ExtractAdjoint_CrossTerm`, and now goes beyond this point having changed the Get routine into `direct_solver->GetNodes()->GetAdjointSolution_intIndexBased(iPoint,Solution);`. Currently, there is no `GetAdjointCoord_intIndexBased` or similar available, and its implementation requires some constructs for the indices. Therefore, I would like to ask for support from @oleburghardt and @pcarruscag to make this work with their changes. ## Related Work; #724 involuntarily removed the discrete adjoint FSI cases from the regression tests.; Branch [fix_discadjfsi](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/fix_discadjfsi) successfully recovers the functionality removed.; #774 introduced relevant changes to the adjoint solver that are making.; #753 was merged and, although I tried to adapt to it, I can't guarantee it's working correctly. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Availability,"s of problems does CodeQL find?; The CodeQL engine that powers GitHub code scanning is the exact same engine that powers LGTM.com. The exact set of rules has been tweaked slightly, but you should see almost exactly the same types of alerts as you were used to on LGTM.com: we’ve enabled the [`security-and-quality` query suite](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#using-queries-in-ql-packs) for you. #### How do I upgrade my CodeQL engine?; No need! New versions of the CodeQL analysis are constantly deployed on GitHub.com; your repository will automatically benefit from the most recently released version. #### The analysis doesn’t seem to be working; If you get an error in GitHub Actions that indicates that CodeQL wasn’t able to analyze your code, please [follow the instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/troubleshooting-the-codeql-workflow) to debug the analysis. #### How do I disable LGTM.com?; If you have LGTM’s automatic pull request analysis enabled, then you can [follow these steps to disable the LGTM pull request analysis](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/managing-automated-code-review#disabling-pr-integration). You don’t actually need to remove your repository from LGTM.com; it will automatically be removed in the next few months as part of the deprecation of LGTM.com ([more info here](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/)). #### Which source code hosting platforms does code scanning support?; GitHub code scanning is deeply integrated within GitHub itself.

I recovered the expected results. Finally, I also ran the case with the Euler equations, on the EBW meshed with Gmsh, and recovered the expected results. In summary, I have tried several meshes from different software, with different numerical parameters on different SU2 versions, but always got bad results when solving RANS equations.; Particularly, the Gmsh mesh preprocessing on SU2 gave a bad z-projection of the EBW.; However, the same meshes gave converged results on CFD++.

As a workaround, have tried; `tjim@t3500:/opt/su2/SU2/TestCases/rans/oneram6$ mpirun --use-hwthread-cpus -np 12 SU2_CFD turb_ONERAM6.cfg`; which seems to work ",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/526:959,error,error,959,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/526,2,"['avail', 'error']","['available', 'error']"

Availability,"t entirely sure how to get it working (running a supersonic Euler). I changed `KIND_ADAPT= GRAD_FLOW` and tried running `SU2_CFD` but no mesh adaptation seemed to take place. After digging around the github comments, I tried running `SU2_src/SU2_PY/mesh_adaptation.py` with python but it gave me an error:. ```; ------------------------- Exit Success (SU2_CFD) ------------------------.

And indeed, when I checked the compiled SU2 bin, `SU2_MSH` seemed to be missing. Has this functionality been removed and is that why the python script is not in the compiled SU2 bin?. I found that some people have had success using the `feature_adap` branch instead but that is running on v7.0.3. I also tried compiling this version but there appears to be a `mesh_adaptation.py` and `mesh_adaptation_amg.py`. If one wants to use mesh adaptation, is this the recommended branch?.

Availability,"ted to a problem? Please describe.**; Under the User's Guide, there are no direct explanations of the different slope limiters available to the user, or what solvers they apply to. I think that information on this topic in the documentation would be extremely helpful to a new user in understanding the differences between the available limiters and their respective strengths/weaknesses. There exists an [open pull request](https://github.com/su2code/su2code.github.io/pull/83/commits/4dcff98256e61d9d478e5af677859cbcfc6c80f1) within the documentation repo that starts this idea. However, it is incomplete and contains very little new information. . **Describe the solution you'd like**; We would like to contribute more to this idea. Specifically, we would like to add. - A description of why slope limiters are used in a FVM formulation. This can explain the concept of Total Variation Diminishing methods, monotonic schemes, and 2nd order accuracy requirements. ; - Mathematically describe the limiters available to the user in SU2. This will include a brief discussion of their properties (e.g., diffusivity, tunable parameters) and potential Sweby plots. ; - An empirical comparison of the available limiters on a test problem(s). One problem that was considered was the laminar cylinder, or the viscous wedge cases. The flowfield colored by the limiter value can be shown to the user. . **Describe alternatives you've considered**; N/A. **Additional context**; This issue ticket is part of an open-source community contribution assignment in our graduate studies ""Numerical Solutions to Partial Differential Equations"". Our team is comprised of four graduate students: Thomas Calascione (@tomtom252525) Grant Norman (@gnorman7), Kal Monroe (@kamo6346), Mitch Wall (@mitchwall85). Our academic research is highly coupled with CFD and numerical methods. For this reason, we chose SU2 as a community we wished to contribute to. .

Availability,"tegration::MultiGrid_Iteration() the index of the ""finest grid"" is then required and the system of equations at the ""finest grid"" level is intended to be solved. This index is set by default with the number multigrid levels specified by the user on the config file. In case that multigrid levels have been removed, when trying to access to the ""finest level"" mesh in CMultiGridIntegration::MultiGrid_Iteration() that level does not exist and produces a segmentation fault. To solve this issue:; - Stop removing multigrid levels in CMultiGridGeometry::CMultiGridGeometry() or improve the function. Why do we need to check whether the ratio is below a certain level?

What are your thoughts?. After solving the previous issues, with mpirun and depending on the number of cores to be used SU2 will still produce a segmentation fault when using Full MG. This problem is not present when using mpiexec. I traced it back and found that in CFVMFlowSolverBase<V, FlowRegime>::Friction_Forces the method GetNormal_Neighbor() from CVertex returns a non existing point.

My versions of mpirun and mpiexec are 3.1.3 and 3.3 respectively. ## Additional Work; Additionally I have corrected the description of the variable Convergence_FullMG in CIntegration.hpp. Related to this same variable, what is the definition of convergence for the full multigrid?; Further, this parameter, Convergence_FullMG, is set to false in CIntegration::CIntegration() and never updated i.e., there is no evaluation whether the FullMG has converged or not.

Availability,"the FULLMG_CYCLE scenario. **Second issue**; This issue is not related to mpi _per se_ but to domain partitioning.; In CMultiGridGeometry::CMultiGridGeometry() is computed the ratio between the number of points in the finest grid and a given coarse grid level. If this ratio is below 2.5 (I do not know why do we make this evaluation neither the reason why exactly 2.5) a multigrid level is removed (without warning the user!?), see lines 629-632.

Additionally, the Navier-Stokes do not have any preprocess phase after the instantiation, why is that ?** ).

Availability,"u have God-classes and ""do-it-all"" functions. The hope is that refactoring these classes will lead to more modular and easier-to-maintain code. ### Decision to use Catch2. Catch2 was chosen for the unit testing library for the following reasons:. + It can be included as a header-only library.; + It has a very clean, easy-to-use syntax; + It has widespread use, including the FEniCS library. ### Design choices. The following design choices are in place. If you disagree with them, then please start a discussion here:. + All tests are placed in a root-level directory named `UnitTests`. Inside this directory is a structure just like the existing folder structure (e.g. `SU2_CFD/numerics`), except that there are not separate `src` and `include` folders.; + Tests are grouped by class, and put in files such as `CNumerics_tests.cpp`.; + A single test executable is compiled and run, as opposed to a separate test executable for each group of tests. With the single test executable, you can always filter down to groups of tests or individual tests.; + When `ninja test` or `meson test` is run, the test executable is only run once, sweeping through all the unit tests. The result only shows a single failure or a single success. If more detail is desired, then the test executable can be run manually.; + The relevant SU2 code is compiled as a library (e.g. `libSU2core`) and then linked into both the main executable (`SU2_CFD`) and the test program (`test_driver`). ### How to Run Unit Tests. If you compile SU2 using `ninja -C builddir`, then the test executable will automatically be compiled. You then have three options for running the tests:. + `meson test` (see documentation [here](https://mesonbuild.com/Unit-tests.html)); + `ninja test`; + Run the exectuable manually: `./UnitTests/test_driver`. When running the executable manually, there are many customization options. Run `./UnitTests/test_driver --help` to see them all. ### How to add unit tests.

Availability,"ython functions that take in a set of FFD points and aggregate their movement in the desired way. All this can be done without any incision into the C++ code, given a python interface that can provide the C++ code the final FFD point locations and letting it do the deformation. . Moving functionality to python could also remove the need for some of the other SU2 modules that haven't been updated for a while. For example, SU2_GEO is a bloated wrapper c++ script that calls a couple of CGeometry/CSurfaceMovement functions. The calling of these functions could be easily ported to python and increase the functionality of the Python Wrapper interface. . Some of the specific things I want to do in this PR:. 1. Refactor SU2_GEO such that all its functionality can be performed in python (in progress); 2. Add a generalized thickness constraint (in progress); 3. Be able to do multiple types of geometry evaluation (for example wing+fuselage); 4. Expose some of the mesh deformation functions to python to allow for robust design variable definition; 5. Perform all of the shape optimization using the in-memory python scripts; 6. Intelligent handling of solution divergences that doesn't break the optimization; 7. Better way to define multipoint optimizations; 8. Better multi-objective optimization definition (#913 might be helpful in this); 9. Simplify the multitude of shape optimization options (#733). As you can probably tell, a lot of my examples and motivations revolve around aerospace applications. So while I try and make a general framework that is robust, I might not be thinking in a broad enough fashion. I would love to get input from the community for any functionality that they might want to see in this framework. The more robust this is, the more widely useful it will be. I am also a newbie to the python wrapper world of SU2.

Convergence history is non deterministic when using the NEWTON_KRYLOV solver using OMP-only parallelism. When fixing the min RMS residual, the computation stops at a different iteration each time I run the solver.; That happens with the EULER or NAVIER_STOKES and RANS solvers. I am using a common setup for each case i.e. ROE+MUSCL convective fluxes, WLSQ for viscous gradients, LSQ for MUSCL gradients. Tried also switching ON and OFF the CFL adaptation and limiters, different linear solvers, and precision (single/double) of the linear solver but that doesn't change the outcome of the test (RANS conv history remains non deterministic while EULER and NS have always the same convergence history). I compiled in release (-O3), with OMP support and exported the mtune/march variables to enable SIMD types. ~~I'll be looking in the SA/Scalar solver for some uninitialized vars. Any other idea?~~.

There is an additional variable that is recognized by CMake scripts - `DEBUG`, turning it `ON` enables additional `STATUS` messages, mainly to check that correct include directories, compile definitions and linked libraries were set up correctly. The remaining options like install location and compilers are handled by CMake. Tested this on Ubuntu with CMake 3.15.5 and everything except `pySU2ad` wrapper compiles. Haven't tested on earlier CMake versions so there might be bugs with them but they should be easy to resolve if any.

Better way to define multipoint optimizations; 8. Better multi-objective optimization definition (#913 might be helpful in this); 9. Simplify the multitude of shape optimization options (#733). As you can probably tell, a lot of my examples and motivations revolve around aerospace applications. So while I try and make a general framework that is robust, I might not be thinking in a broad enough fashion. I would love to get input from the community for any functionality that they might want to see in this framework. The more robust this is, the more widely useful it will be. I am also a newbie to the python wrapper world of SU2.

Deployability," aerodynamic shape and structural sizing optimization using dedicated frameworks (e.g. OpenMDAO). . Startup development costs include the creation of modular tools that are _designed to be driven_ by another framework like OpenMDAO, rather than _to drive execution_ themselves. However, leveraging those MDAO frameworks assumes that software codes and modules to be coupled exist, have appropriate data structures, execution and query APIs, and are wrapped in Python for flexibility and ease of use. The proposed changes were motivated with the goal of making SU2 more modular and flexible, particularly to facilitate its integration into large-scale MDAO frameworks. For more details on the motivation, methodology, and verification & validation results, please refer to our [paper from AIAA Aviation 2022](https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-3358). . ## Proposed Changes; @aa-g and I propose the following code updates:. 1.

Deployability," and boostconv algorithm as proposed by [2]. _SFD_: A method, enabling the computation of steady solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in globally unstable configurations. Steady-state is achieved by damping the unstable temporal frequencies with addition of a dissipative relaxation term proportional to the high-frequency content of the velocity fluctuations. [1]. _boostconv_: An iterative algorithm, inspired by Krylov-subspace methods, which is able to compute unstable steady states and/or accelerate the convergence to stable configurations. This algorithm is based on the minimization of the residual norm at each iteration step with a projection basis updated at each iteration rather than at periodic restarts like in the classical GMRES method. The algorithm is able to stabilize any dynamical system without increasing the computational time of the original numerical procedure used to solve the governing equations. _Moreover, it can be easily inserted into a pre-existing relaxation (integration) procedure with a call to a single black-box subroutine_. [2]. **Additional context**; I would be happy to collaborate on implementation of said algorithms in SU2 but I do not have much experience with C++ (I mostly use Fortran) and I am not too familiar with SU2 source code so it would be great to work with someone more experienced in those areas.

Deployability," coupled via the python interface, while SU2 shall provide the aerodynamic side, as a higher fidelity alternative to panel methods such as VLM & DLM. . Update, 13.04.2023: The combination of grid velocities from the moving + deforming grid turned out to be more complicated as expected (at least for me) and the moving grid is not fully implemented for unsteady simulations (according to Pedro, some source terms are missing). The new approach uses a farfield onflow condition at alpha=0.0 and translates and rotates the whole aircraft in the elastic mesh for the rigid body + structural dynamic reaction. This is more laborious on my side (transformation of the surface, the deformation vector and the forces about the Euler angles) but simplifies the work on the SU2 side:. - extend the gust to 3D meshes (current implementation only for 2D meshes); - ~~update the grid movement during the time domain simulation via the python interface; Involved parameters: ; GRID_MOVEMENT= ROTATING_FRAME; TRANSLATION_RATE= u v w ; ROTATION_RATE= p q r~~; - update the surface mesh deformation during the time domain simulation via the python interface ; Involved parameters: ; DEFORM_MESH= YES; MARKER_DEFORM_MESH= ( list of markers ). Summing up, I will need to combine the grid velocities due to aircraft movement, elasticity and gust. Currently, this is not possible in SU2. ; I split the work into the following steps.

Deployability," from python and we can easily ship it (as a submodule) since it needs no installation/compilation. . ### What is ninja ?; ninja is a replacement for make and is used to execute the compiler and to resolve dependencies. Meson uses ninja as the default backend. So instead of using configure + make, we use meson + ninja. As with meson, we can ship it as a submodule. It needs a compilation, but again it has no dependencies apart from python. ### How to use ?; The correct meson and ninja versions are added as git submodules. So in case you don't have meson and ninja installed (there should be packages available for all major distros), compile ninja using:. ```; cd externals/ninja; ./configure.py --bootstrap; cd ..; export PATH=$PWD/externals/ninja:$PWD/externals/meson:$PATH; ```; and run meson using; ```; meson.py build --prefix=$PWD -Denable-pywrapper=true -Denable-autodiff=true; ```; to ocnfigure SU2 with the python wrapper and AD support enabled. MPI support will be enabled by default if a proper mpi installation can be found. ; Finally compile the code with; ```; ninja -C build; ```. - ""build"" in the commands above is a folder where the configuration will be stored. You can configure multiple directories with different configurations (like for a debug build etc); - ninja uses all available cores in your system by default. Still you can set the number of jobs using `-j N`. ### Additional notes; - Meson requires python 3, so implicitly we get this requirement now. But I think it is less of a problem than some of you probably might think. A lot of problems we have come from the fact the we support python 2 and python 3. As I was setting up travis (getting there in a moment) I noticed that is easily possible to compile the code with python 3 (for the python wrapper) and run the python scripts with python 2 and vice versa, which eventually leads to errors and crashes.

Deployability," gradients computes a reinterpretation of the gradient in a different Hilbert space, [see this short overview.](http://www.cse.unt.edu/~renka/papers/sobolev.pdf); This is done by solving an elliptic PDE with the sensitivities, i.e., ( e1 Id - e2 Laplace) delta_x = - dF / dx, with different weights e1, e2. Inserting the sensitivities from the discrete adjoint solver for (dF / dx) leads to the gradient in a Sobolev space.; The method can be extended to incorporate the parameterization of the mesh cells x=M(p) with design values p, [see here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15279) Using the projected gradient w.r.t. the design values the systems takes the form; (dM/dp)^T (e1 Id - e2 Laplace) (dM/dp) = - dF/dp. Such treatment can help prevent noise in the derivative computation and leads to smoother design updates. Especially, when working in a One-Shot optimization context.; Here the optimization is done with inexact function values and gradients, i.e., the flow and adjoint solvers are only partially converged between design updates. For this setting simple gradient descent with too large update steps will not work, since a few flow iterations are not enough to recover a solution from the restart file from the last optimization step.; See the graphic below for drag minimization of a NACA 0012 airfoil with constant lift, where the Sobolev solver for the gradient leads to smoother deformations and better optimization.; ![pullrequest1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16785869/143250126-e5bdd360-e265-40ca-9d24-5811ecbb759c.jpg). Application is done as a post-processing step in the SU2_DOT_AD executable.; The new solver constructs the necessary operator and solves it using the features of the finite element implementation in SU2. For this, it uses the same elements as the FEA solver but extends the definitions of the Gauss quadrature to be second order.; It can operate in two different modes:. 1) The smoothing can be applied to the mesh sensitivities, either in the com",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1446:1199,update,updates,1199,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1446,1,['update'],['updates']

Deployability," rough wall, the WALL_TYPE option must specified for all the markers and WALL_ROUGHNESS set to 0.0 for smooth walls and the desired value for rough walls. ; [Sample input file for airfoil with smooth and rough walls](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/4198580/turb_naca62215_v7cfg.txt). The airfoil used here is the NACA 622215 and I can send the mesh and experimental data in case anyone is interested. . ## Additional notes. Modification of wall distance computation required some changes to the ADT routines and subsequently to some FEM stuff as well. To modify the wall distance with roughness, I needed to know which marker was the closest wall and add the corresponding roughness. However, I wasn't sure how to properly do this in MPI. My solution was to pass the marker roughness information to the ADT class itself. This meant I had to add a dummy argument whenever the corresponding ADT classes were called elsewhere. Just to clarify, the modification is only in CADTElem class constructor and ComputeWallDistance routines. I hope this will not be a problem. I made this as a draft PR in case there are some issues with this. Also, if there are any issues with how the config file is changed, I can update that as well. I haven't modified the config_template for this yet. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply. You can fill this out after submitting the PR. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!

Two other aspects.; 1. the PRESSURE_DROP OF is computed in streamwise periodic flow using the Recovered_Pressure (as the ""standard"" Pressure is the same on both faces). There I need to make sure that the recovered values are computed as well after the iteration (but with the Flow Preprocessing after the MultiGridCycle that seems to be the case); 2. As pressure drop is iterated to get the correct flow solution, is it necessary to treat is specially in the adjoint like a solution variable? <- turns out, that was the case and also is the majority of work done in this PR.

Deployability," that the Prism and Pyramid shape elements used for mesh deformation had some issues, namely:; - The Prism (6 nodes) element had incorrect integration points, and perhaps due to some inconsistency between the ordering of the nodes and the shape function it had ""negative"" stiffness (deform opposite to force). The latter issue was remedied by using negative weights... I tried permuting the integration points but that did not help.; - The Pyramid (5 nodes) had inconsistent integration points and shape functions, it was using pyramid points but degenerate hex functions, this made the element some 20 times more flexible than it should be, pyramid shape functions are used now. My main reason to look into this was to support all element types in the structural solver both for linear and nonlinear analysis, in principle that should be working now, but I still have tests to run. I took the opportunity to refactor the CElement family of classes, now the derived classes only deal with the shape specifics:; - Integration/extrapolation points, shape function and derivatives, are computed and stored at construction.; - Area/Volume computation in undeformed (reference) or deformed (current) coordinates. Generic actions like allocating data and computing gradients are done by the base class. For the latter I included one method for 2D and another for 3D, they only differ in the inversion of the Jacobian but being specialized nDim can be ""hardcoded"" which should allow for more compile time optimization. I expect some regressions to fail, and I will still run more tests to verify the revised elements. I will post those results and add a regression. ## PR Checklist. - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [X] I have added a test case that demonstrates my c",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/681:1086,Integrat,Integration,1086,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/681,1,['Integrat'],['Integration']

Deployability," the features of the finite element implementation in SU2. For this, it uses the same elements as the FEA solver but extends the definitions of the Gauss quadrature to be second order.; It can operate in two different modes:. 1) The smoothing can be applied to the mesh sensitivities, either in the complete mesh or only design boundaries. See the picture below for an example of this.; ![PicforSU2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16785869/149150313-a996ecba-fe7f-4de7-983e-560410b840b4.jpeg). 2) It also includes the possibility to take the mesh parameterization into account, compute the derivatives (dM/dp), and smooth the sensitivities w.r.t. the design parameters. This is done by the same AD logic used in SU2_DOT.cpp::SetProjection_AD. The routines are extended, such that AD can compute arbitrary matrix-vector products with the Jacobian of the parameterization and apply the smoothing operator to the gradient.

Deployability," to compute the mesh deformation. The adjoint sensitivities can now be propagated down to the surface mesh points without the need to use DOT, although further work is needed to propagate them to the FFD points or other DV of choice. I tried to keep config options simple: the new mesh solver is enabled using; ` DEFORM_MESH = YES `; and the relevant markers which will move and introduce deformations into the domain are set using; `MARKER_DEFORM_MESH= ( wall )`; Hopefully, previous mesh deformation structures can be deprecated and removed soon, but we will need to adapt the rigid/imposed boundary deformation of other kinds of grid movement. I kindly ask for your help in there, as I'm not very familiar with some of the legacy code for this purpose. Additionally, in this PR I have done some refactoring so the AD-based adjoint routines are accessible from the python-wrapped version of the code. The SWIG wrapper now compiles the AD binaries and interfaces directly to sensitivity information, which should make it much easier to integrate SU2 within any python-based optimization framework. . ## Related Work; - Some work will be needed to adapt the new contiguous variable structure by @pcarruscag in #753; - I have added a couple of regression tests, but I will add tutorials once #724 is merged. As of now, a bug reported in #713 prevents me from adding any meaningful tutorial - but that should be fixed in #724 according to @talbring ; - I already started adding the mesh solver, numerics and transfer functions in separate files as discussed in #583 and already started in #725. For clarity and ease of merging, only new classes are split so far, but I will probably start splitting other structures soon in PRs to come. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability," with more cores, as all objects files are build truly in parallel (with make only objects of the same target are build in parallel). Another advantage is that meson has multiplatform support for linux, mac and windows. . ### Why not cmake ?; Meson files are much easier to read and in general it is much better to maintain. Furthermore it has a great documentation. Finally, meson has no dependencies apart from python and we can easily ship it (as a submodule) since it needs no installation/compilation. . ### What is ninja ?; ninja is a replacement for make and is used to execute the compiler and to resolve dependencies. Meson uses ninja as the default backend. So instead of using configure + make, we use meson + ninja. As with meson, we can ship it as a submodule. It needs a compilation, but again it has no dependencies apart from python. ### How to use ?; The correct meson and ninja versions are added as git submodules. So in case you don't have meson and ninja installed (there should be packages available for all major distros), compile ninja using:. ```; cd externals/ninja; ./configure.py --bootstrap; cd ..; export PATH=$PWD/externals/ninja:$PWD/externals/meson:$PATH; ```; and run meson using; ```; meson.py build --prefix=$PWD -Denable-pywrapper=true -Denable-autodiff=true; ```; to ocnfigure SU2 with the python wrapper and AD support enabled.

You can configure multiple directories with different configurations (like for a debug build etc); - ninja uses all available cores in your system by default. Still you can set the number of jobs using `-j N`. ### Additional notes; - Meson requires python 3, so implicitly we get this requirement now.

Deployability,"# Describe the bug. **Issue**; The memory usage of SU2_CFD continuously grows over time and is most noticeable when writing out files at high frequency. This caught my attention when cluster jobs with higher output frequency were consistently exceeding memory limits after a certain amount of time, leading to the job being killed. The same configuration with a lower output frequency can run significantly more iterations without exceeding limits. I may be missing something, but it seems like there is a potential memory leak dependent on the output frequency, which I've documented in this report. **Expected**; Memory usage remains steady over time and does not significantly change with output frequency. **Local tests**; I was able to reproduce the issue locally on a workstation using the [Unsteady NACA0012 Tutorial case](https://github.com/su2code/Tutorials/tree/master/compressible_flow/Unsteady_NACA0012), whereby all 2200 time iterations are performed by setting `WINDOW_CAUCHY_CRIT = NO`. As you can see in the plot below, the memory usage increases over time and is more pronounced with a lower `OUTPUT_WRT_FREQ`:. ![unsteady_naca0012_mem_usage_by_freq_20210413](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82448366/114564646-c9275380-9c70-11eb-8352-c5f1e4492c35.png). Further editing the config file to run as a steady state simulation with `INNER_ITER= 20000` iterations produces similar results:. ![steady_naca0012_memory_usage_by_output_freq_v711_20210413](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82448366/114564622-c4fb3600-9c70-11eb-873d-f9e0696c6484.png). **Serial case**; This issue was not reproducible in serial and exhibits expected behavior:. ![serial_steady_state_naca0012_memory_usage_20210413](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82448366/114564602-bf9deb80-9c70-11eb-89dd-88d1e240ce79.png). # To Reproduce.

Deployability,"# Patching CVE-2007-4559. Hi, we are security researchers from the Advanced Research Center at [Trellix](https://www.trellix.com). We have began a campaign to patch a widespread bug named CVE-2007-4559. CVE-2007-4559 is a 15 year old bug in the Python tarfile package. By using extract() or extractall() on a tarfile object without sanitizing input, a maliciously crafted .tar file could perform a directory path traversal attack. We found at least one unsantized extractall() in your codebase and are providing a patch for you via pull request. The patch essentially checks to see if all tarfile members will be extracted safely and throws an exception otherwise. We encourage you to use this patch or your own solution to secure against CVE-2007-4559. Further technical information about the vulnerability can be found in this [blog](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/tarfile-exploiting-the-world.html).

For all other volume outputs, the filename is specified with 'VOLUME_FILENAME' in the config file. See e.g. the Paraview XML filename. This is counter-intuitive and the user is not able to change the multiblock filename in the config file. . This PR aligns the filename handling of the Paraview multiblock output with the other volume outputs, besides calling the `config->GetUnsteady_FileName` function instead of the `config->GetFilename` function which is used for the other volume outputs. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Therefore, the polytropic Peng-Robinson class now allows for inheritance. - New test case (TestCases/nicfd/edge_NPPR) to compare the results of the NPPR with a constant CP model (CP = n0) and the polytropic Peng-Robinson models. The results of both simulations for this test case are equivalent. ## Related Work. - The polytropic Peng-Robinson remains functionally unchanged. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes. Current situation: The translation velocities and rotation rates of a moving frame (activated with GRID_MOVEMENT= ROTATING_FRAME) can only be set in the config file using parameters TRANSLATION_RATE and ROTATION_RATE. During a trim analysis of a free-flying aircraft, these parameters are modified until an equilibrium is achieved. Problem: A change of these parameters requires a new initialization of the solver, which can be time-consuming depending on the mesh size. Proposed solution: A python interface is implemented that allows to change the parameters on-the-fly. The grid velocities are updated before a new iteration. . ## Related Work; This is an extension to pull request #1621. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

There is no style-checking workflow. As different users use different environment sometimes pull request contains unrelated style changes which makes the PR unreadable. This PR proposes to use [pre-commit-hooks ](https://pre-commit.com/) which are easy to use and enforce the style and adds a workflow check for formatting. There is no formatted/style proposed for python files. This PR additionally proposes a[ black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) based python formatting that ensures the python files are consistent maximum line length is set to 120 to increase readability. Moreover, pre-commit has additional hooks for the style of files. ; The following ones are proposed: ; `trailing-whitespace - trims trailing whitespace.` -> Especially useful for config files.; `mixed-line-ending - replaces or checks mixed line ending.`; `end-of-file-fixer - ensures that a file is either empty or ends with one newline.`. the pre-commit hooks can be easily installed via pip `pip install pre-commit`. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

The idea is to use the static libraries su2_cfd_lib and su2_cfd_lib_ad for linking when building SU2_DEF, SU2_DOT, SU2_SOL. This way it is no longer necessary to extract the needed sources for building the executables by hand in the meson.build files of each subdirectory.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes. The draft pull request has changes to fix couple of issues in the incompressible solver for rotating frame and convergence rate of unsteady problems (both with and without grid movement).; ; For the rotating frame, there was a confusion between conservative and primitive variables being used for the numerics. For the convergence rate of unsteady problems, the Jacobian contributions in the dual time residual calculations had been altered to include the preconditioner. However, this slows down the convergence from only an order of 100 iterations needed for converged solution per time step to the order of 1000 iterations. Therefore this has been reverted to regain the previous faster convergence rate and further work is necessary to understand the reason for this change. ## Related Work; PR #652 . ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes. The proposed solver is a treatment of the discrete adjoint sensitivities based on the idea of Sobolev gradient smoothing. . Sobolev smoothing of gradients computes a reinterpretation of the gradient in a different Hilbert space, [see this short overview.](http://www.cse.unt.edu/~renka/papers/sobolev.pdf); This is done by solving an elliptic PDE with the sensitivities, i.e., ( e1 Id - e2 Laplace) delta_x = - dF / dx, with different weights e1, e2. Inserting the sensitivities from the discrete adjoint solver for (dF / dx) leads to the gradient in a Sobolev space.; The method can be extended to incorporate the parameterization of the mesh cells x=M(p) with design values p, [see here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15279) Using the projected gradient w.r.t. the design values the systems takes the form; (dM/dp)^T (e1 Id - e2 Laplace) (dM/dp) = - dF/dp. Such treatment can help prevent noise in the derivative computation and leads to smoother design updates. Especially, when working in a One-Shot optimization context.; Here the optimization is done with inexact function values and gradients, i.e., the flow and adjoint solvers are only partially converged between design updates. For this setting simple gradient descent with too large update steps will not work, since a few flow iterations are not enough to recover a solution from the restart file from the last optimization step.; See the graphic below for drag minimization of a NACA 0012 airfoil with constant lift, where the Sobolev solver for the gradient leads to smoother deformations and better optimization.; ![pullrequest1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16785869/143250126-e5bdd360-e265-40ca-9d24-5811ecbb759c.jpg).

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes. This PR enforces the continuity of velocity explicitly at the fluid structure interface for each time step. The velocity was previously recalculated for the fluid nodes based on displacement history of the nodes. This is still needed for fluid only problems with deforming meshes. However, for FSI problems, the velocity at the interface can be transferred from the structural solution and propagated to the fluid nodes similarly to the displacement which ensures exact agreement at the interface at each time-step.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes. This is a draft PR to discuss and document a much needed overhaul of the shape optimization features in SU2. There have been significant improvements to the main code base (for example, python wrapper integration, the new output structure, new mesh solver etc.) which haven't been leveraged by the shape optimization structure of SU2. . The main idea behind this overhaul is to move as much of the functionality of the current shape optimization framework to python. This creates a more user-friendly and robust interface for defining design variables and constraints. Its easy to make that claim, but let me elucidate it with an example:. > Suppose I am trying to optimize a wing for a given flight condition but I want more design freedom than altering the airfoil shapes along the wing using FFDs. I want to be able to control wing span, taper ratio, dihedral angle, twist, and any number of other geometrical representations of the wing. Currently, I would have to create a new Design Variable (DV) for most of those variables. If anyone has tried this, they know it is a tedious task with having to make alterations in various parts of the code.; >; > But all of these design variables can be represented by aggregations of FFD point movements. The span of the wing can be controlled by constraining the movement of FFD points in the y-direction to be proportional to their y coordinate. The current twist variable does a similar aggregation, at each twist location it rotates the corresponding 4 FFD points by the given angle. ; >; >These design variables could be represented by simple python functions that take in a set of FFD points and aggregate their movement in the desired way. All this can be done without any incision into the C++ code, given a python interface that can provide the C++ code the final FFD point locations and letting it do the deformation. .

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes. With this pull request, we aim to initialize the fluid models based on the Ideal gas laws for incompressible flows in a standard way using the THERMODYNAMIC_PRESSURE($P_{op}$) and the INC_TEMPERATURE_INIT ($T_{init}$), the initial density is computed based on the ideal gas law :. $\rho_{init}= P_{op} / R T_{init}$. When the FLUID_MODEL is CONSTANT_DENSITY, the constant density must be given in the config file using the option DENSITY_CONSTANT, similar as it is done when viscosity, thermal conductivity and diffusivity models are chosen as constant. ## Related Work. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Using absolute cauchy convergence is more robust in this case. At the same time, I understand that a more complex input / more parameters might confuse users. An automatic switch, as propsed in this pull request, is a good compromise.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; *Give a brief overview of your contribution here in a few sentences.*; ; This PR greatly improves the robustness and convergence behavior of the flow solvers by implementing a more sophisticated controller for nonlinear iterations along with several other important modifications. The changes are the following:; - New under-relaxation strategy. Variables such as density and energy are only allowed to change by +/- 20% with each nonlinear iteration by applying an under-relaxation parameter to the updates at each node, which helps with difficult transients, especially at calculation startup. Also applied to turbulence model updates (though threshold is larger).; - CFL adaption via an exponential progression with under-relaxation approach, i.e., changes to CFL are coupled to the under-relaxation parameter (small under-relaxation parameter = decrease, and large = increase). CFL is now locally defined for each CV for this process.; - Modified realizability checks to avoid negative density/pressure/temperature at the nodes and also during 2nd-order reconstruction at cell faces.; - CV face states for 2nd-order MUSCL are now optionally reconstructed with a separate gradient method (unweighted least squares recommended), which is very important for robustness. Gradients for viscous terms and sources are still computed via GG or WLS for accuracy reasons.; - SA model was being clipped unnecessarily. This clipping has been removed. Here is my recommendation on how to run all of your 2nd-order cases going forward:. ### Euler / Laminar N-S; Turn off the limiters, unless you truly need them for preserving solution monotonicity (e.g., for shocks/discontinuities). Use ; ```; NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON= LEAST_SQUARES; ```; for robustness. Start with a CFL around 10 and converge the implicit system with LINEAR_SOLVER_ITER= 10 for each nonlinear iteration (FGMRES + ILU0 recommended). Activate the CFL adaption with. ```; % Parameters of the adaptive CFL number (factor down",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790:521,update,updates,521,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790,2,['update'],['updates']

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; - Added non-polytropic Peng-Robinson (NPPR_GAS) equation of state (CP temperature dependant model): the specific heat ratio is not constant but a polynomial model (CP = n0 + n1T + n2T^2 +n3T^3 + n4T^4) can be specified for the specific heat via the input file option (CP_POLYCOEFFS). - The NPPR fluid model uses the polytropic Peng-Robinson fluid model as a base class. Therefore, the polytropic Peng-Robinson class now allows for inheritance. - New test case (TestCases/nicfd/edge_NPPR) to compare the results of the NPPR with a constant CP model (CP = n0) and the polytropic Peng-Robinson models.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; A draft PR for creating self-registering classes with a factory.; The class (CEulerSolver implemented) that wants to register to a factory (CSolverFactory implemented) should:; - Inherit from DBMember template class (new, only handles automatic-registration).; - Provide a ""GetName()"" member method which returns the registered name as a string.; - Provide a ""CreateMethod()"" member with specific signature. This function should handle the full-creation of the object (For CEulerSolver, it makes a pointer and runs Preprocessing on it). The factory class must provide a Register() method that accepts the to-be registered class's name and a pointer to its creation method with the specific signature mentioned above. These design constraints are all enforced in DBMember but no checks where made for now. Instead of meddling with member functions of CSolverFactory, I chose to create the test solver (EULER) directly in CDriver. ### Results so far; 1. Solver gets instantiated successfully, the solver preprocessing phase passes with no problems; 2. When the program gets to integration preprocessing, it fails with out_of_range exception. But that's to be expected as no solver metadata is tracked for the newly created solver yet :).

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Added CMake build support for SU2. With this, many popular IDEs will be able to use SU2 as a project with minimal setup. CMake also enables to add dependencies more easily since most libraries have CMake support. `vcpkg` is great for the libraries available there. SU2 CMake has the same build options as autotools but uses CMake to find system libraries and compilers (MKL, Mutationpp, MPI and Python currently). No longer need to specify paths to compilers/libraries if they are in standard locations. In addition, compile flags can be modified from CMake. There is no need to use `preconfigure.py` anymore since downloading/unpacking is handled by CMake and is system-agnostic. At the moment, all library targets are static but that could be easily changed to be configurable from CMake. The installation directory is `${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}/bin`. Similarly to autotools, some build options are disabled if built with Codi forward/reverse datatypes or without MPI. Note that SWIG fails to compile `pySU2ad` with `Nothing known about namespace 'medi'` in `Common/include/mpi_structure.hpp:57` without `-includeall` SWIG option but then it takes forever to generate the wrapper (more than 15 minutes on my machine, stopped early). I suggest removing `using namespace` declarations and either importing used symbols explicitly with `using` or prepending namespace name, `clang-tidy` warns against them and it makes the code clearer. SU2 CMake options are:; * Build modules:; * `SU2_BUILD_CFD`: `ON|OFF`; * `SU2_BUILD_DEF`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi; * `SU2_BUILD_DOT`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi forward; * `SU2_BUILD_GEO`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi; * `SU2_BUILD_MSH`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi; * `SU2_BUILD_PY_WRAPPER`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi forward; * `SU2_BUILD_SOL`: `ON|OFF`, disabled when building with Codi; * Enable modules:; * `SU2_ENABLE_CGNS`: ; * `SU2_CGNS_CPPFLAGS`: flags to pas",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814:816,install,installation,816,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814,1,['install'],['installation']

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; As proposed in #685, this introduces the [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/index.html) and ninja build system to eventually replace autotools and make. A [lot of bigger projects](https://mesonbuild.com/Users.html) already use that system (e.g. GNOME, systemd ...) or are transitioning. Compared to autotools and make, building the code should be faster, especially if you build with more cores, as all objects files are build truly in parallel (with make only objects of the same target are build in parallel). Another advantage is that meson has multiplatform support for linux, mac and windows. . ### Why not cmake ?; Meson files are much easier to read and in general it is much better to maintain. Furthermore it has a great documentation. Finally, meson has no dependencies apart from python and we can easily ship it (as a submodule) since it needs no installation/compilation. . ### What is ninja ?; ninja is a replacement for make and is used to execute the compiler and to resolve dependencies. Meson uses ninja as the default backend. So instead of using configure + make, we use meson + ninja. As with meson, we can ship it as a submodule. It needs a compilation, but again it has no dependencies apart from python. ### How to use ?; The correct meson and ninja versions are added as git submodules. So in case you don't have meson and ninja installed (there should be packages available for all major distros), compile ninja using:. ```; cd externals/ninja; ./configure.py --bootstrap; cd ..; export PATH=$PWD/externals/ninja:$PWD/externals/meson:$PATH; ```; and run meson using; ```; meson.py build --prefix=$PWD -Denable-pywrapper=true -Denable-autodiff=true; ```; to ocnfigure SU2 with the python wrapper and AD support enabled. MPI support will be enabled by default if a proper mpi installation can be found. ; Finally compile the code with; ```; ninja -C build; ```. - ""build"" in the commands above is a folder where the configuration will be stored.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Compute Green-Gauss gradients and limiters via a point-loop (like we do for Least Squares), in the limit this allows one thread per point of parallelization. Parallel regions are started inside the functions and again only the master thread calls MPI routines. Move these routines out of CSolver and make them general to reduce code duplication (compressible/incompressible, solution/primitives), and to improve test-ability (if key areas of the code depend less on large objects we can more easily treat them as units). Introduce a way to create different limiters by defining small details like the limiter function (and its associated constants), or any geometry-based modification.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Edge coloring tends to perform better than reductions for the hybrid parallel discrete adjoint because it uses less memory and enables the shared reading optimization. This PR puts two additional strategies in place for the discrete adjoint that help with obtaining a coloring before resorting to reductions, making successful coloring more likely. 1. If the requested edge color group size does not produce an efficient coloring, the maximum edge color group size that still produces an efficient coloring is chosen instead.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi all,. The general idea for this PR can be cited from @pcarruscag in #1226:; ```; The ideia would be to create a CFVMSolverBase (in the style of the one for flow solvers) to cover:. Turbulence solvers;; Heat solver;; Radiation solver;; General passive/active scalar solvers;; Eventual transition solvers;. The starting point would be the current base turbulence solver.; ```; ; Right now the only things I did were (i.e. don't fear the large diff); - create CScalarSolver/Variable files/classes and scalar_convection/diffusion/sources files and fill them with the contents of the CTurb* or turb_* files.; - Make CScalarSolver/Variable the parent class of CTurbSolver/Variable; - Delete pretty much everything from CTurb* or turb_* files except for some constructors. So far it compiled and some local regression testing showed no problems, lets see what the CI pipeline has to say about this. Now with this additional class introduced the actual works begins:; - figure out what is a reasonable interface in CScalar* to unify transported species and turb-models (and the other solvers probably); - code this common interface and push all turb-specific things back into the respective files (that is why I didn't `git mv` ). In order to keep this somewhat limited I would focus on porting the Turbsolvers to the new structure (however that might look, but looking at #1223 is what I'll do first) and maybe a simple transported passive scalar or so.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi all,. The title gives it away. I imagine that piece by piece some commits are chipped in to remove more and more enum numbers. Like that it is more obvious if sth breaks because somewhere someone uses builds on knowing the actual number to do some shenanigans. ; Maybe just removing all in a big blow saves time bit #1220 already shows some limitations. I used the following command (for streamwise periodic in this case) and looked over the results whether I notice sth fishy. Not perfect but might help catchin some easy problems.; ```bash; grep -r 'NO_STREAMWISE_PERIODIC\|PRESSURE_DROP\|STREAMWISE_MASSFLOW\|Streamwise_Periodic_Map\|GetKind_Streamwise_Periodic' SU2_CFD SU2_DOT SU2_GEO SU2_DEF Common --include=*cpp --include=*hpp --include=*inl; ```.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi all,. This PR adds the possibility to write ASCII STL files. Example usage:; `OUTPUT_FILES= (RESTART,PARAVIEW, STL, ...)`; All surfaces in `MARKER_PLOTTING` will be used, just like the surface files. The major problem was to re-process the element connectivity for parallel cases from what the data available after the parallel data sorter does its thing. You'll notice that in the `CSTLFileWriter.cpp` : Part of the code was copied over from the TecIO stuff and modified to our needs. The code probably could be nicer and it could be better documented, but I already forgot some details and it most likely would still be a mess to understand. Big thanks to @talbring for making this code work. I added a simple regression test by `diff`ing against a reference stl-file from in the Testcases repo.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi all,. This PR implements a passive species transport solver. The passive means, that the mass fraction at each location does not influence any fluid-properties and thereby the mean flow (which reminds me that this is a good sanity check to compare mean flow residuals). A new `CSpeciesSolver` and `CSpeciesVariable` were added based on the `CScalar*` things done in #1330 . Additionally `species_convection/diffusion/sources` were added just as it is the case for the turbulence solver (both based on the general scalar* framework). Please note that prob ~1000 lines are cfg's, README's, helping scripts. . ## Related Work; Preliminary work was done in #1330 with creating a base class for scalar transport equations. #1223 and #1332 already mostly implement the here shown species solver and big chunks were copied over from there, but they are not based on the new CScalarSolver. In order to chunk the work for these branches this PR will not contain any species mixing properties or TableLookUps. . After this PR #1332 will be tackled next.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi all,; there is a little bug in the loading of the primal solution for the DiscAdjFluid Iteration for DualTimeStepping 1st order. ; 1. The solution for timestep n-1 should be loaded instead of n-2 -> I added an if statement there.; 2. solution_old is used as a temporary container for the freshly loaded solution. Then the solution which is currently at solution_time_n is pushed to be the ""main"" solution n+1. Afterwards the solution_old is put in the solution_time_n container -> That last step was wrong such that the loaded solution never gets involved. I used the regression test in disc_adj_rans/cylinder which covers DualTimeStepping 2nd order and reused it for a new Testcase which covers 1st order. ; For now, the .travis.yml has a different su2code/Testcases branch in it such that other are not hindered by this PR when running travis. If this PR is merged with the new Testcase, the TestCases repo has to be updated and the .travis.yml needs to be reverted. ; Let me know if adding a new TestCase is OK. I am aware that not every detail can get its own regression test. . I checked my changes against finite differences for that Testcase. I'll post the result below.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Hi, . A small one: For 1 zone heat equation, the primal restart for the adjoint run was missing the solution reset after the CLEAR_INDICES run. Additionally I added a output_precision to the primal Residual Table for the adjoint. My recommendation is to set OUTPUT_PRECISION= 12 (because that is the fixed field Width of the table) and compare those screen residuals to the history output of the comparing primal simulations. I noticed this problem while looking at non-perfect restarts for CHT cases, which I am currently still debugging. I will make an issue for that soon (Edit #1395 ).

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; I added new output file formats. First of all support for the VTK XML file format ([see this pdf](https://vtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/file-formats.pdf)) (file ending *.vtu). This adds support for possible compression, portable binary encoding, random access, big endian and little endian byte order, multiple file representation of piece data. I made this the new default format if `PARAVIEW` has been added to `OUTPUT_FILES`. The old *.vtk format can still be used with `PARAVIEW_LEGACY`. However, the main reason for this new format is that it is required for new Multiblock file (*.vtm) output. This file is a simple XML file which defines a data hierarchy in order to represent individual parts of the domain (which are stored as *.vtu files). With this it is possible to directly select and visualize the solution in individual zones and/or on boundaries. This new format can be enabled with `PARAVIEW_MULTIBLOCK` as value for `OUTPUT_FILES`. At the moment all boundaries are written, I might add an option to disable/enable some of them (maybe re-using the `MARKER_PLOTTING` option). In order not to cluster the working directory, the individual *.vtu files are placed in subfolders, since they are more or less opaque to the user. . ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; I have found it useful to be able to adaptively change deltaT using the Python wrapper -- this PR implements that functionality. Instead of `CDriver::GetUnsteadyTimeStep` returning `CConfig::GetTime_Step`, it was updated to return the actual dimensional timestep used in iterations. A new `CDriver::SetUnsteadyTimeStep` function was implemented that updates both `Delta_UnstTimeND` and `Delta_UnstTime` in `CConfig`. A new setter function for `Delta_UnstTime` had to be implemented to do this as well. A quick grep showed me that the only usage of `CConfig::GetTime_Step` appears to be in SU2_SOL, initialization, and outputting in the NonDimTable. However, I did see one usage of it here, which appears to be called every iteration:. https://github.com/su2code/SU2/blob/2c9fbb6cfc0f9dfbb4a1f6afb9cf5004c33b1c25/SU2_CFD/src/integration/CFEM_DG_Integration.cpp#L75.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; I would like to be able to calculate a gust encounter of a free-flying, elastic aircraft. The rigid body reaction (in terms of velocities u, v, w and rotation rates p, q, r) as well as the elastic structural dynamic reaction (displacement of all surface nodes of the CFD mesh) are calculated by our own aeroelastic solver, coupled via the python interface, while SU2 shall provide the aerodynamic side, as a higher fidelity alternative to panel methods such as VLM & DLM. . Update, 13.04.2023: The combination of grid velocities from the moving + deforming grid turned out to be more complicated as expected (at least for me) and the moving grid is not fully implemented for unsteady simulations (according to Pedro, some source terms are missing). The new approach uses a farfield onflow condition at alpha=0.0 and translates and rotates the whole aircraft in the elastic mesh for the rigid body + structural dynamic reaction. This is more laborious on my side (transformation of the surface, the deformation vector and the forces about the Euler angles) but simplifies the work on the SU2 side:. - extend the gust to 3D meshes (current implementation only for 2D meshes); - ~~update the grid movement during the time domain simulation via the python interface; Involved parameters: ; GRID_MOVEMENT= ROTATING_FRAME; TRANSLATION_RATE= u v w ; ROTATION_RATE= p q r~~; - update the surface mesh deformation during the time domain simulation via the python interface ; Involved parameters: ; DEFORM_MESH= YES; MARKER_DEFORM_MESH= ( list of markers ).

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; In a joint collaboration with @rsanfer we discovered that the Prism and Pyramid shape elements used for mesh deformation had some issues, namely:; - The Prism (6 nodes) element had incorrect integration points, and perhaps due to some inconsistency between the ordering of the nodes and the shape function it had ""negative"" stiffness (deform opposite to force). The latter issue was remedied by using negative weights... I tried permuting the integration points but that did not help.; - The Pyramid (5 nodes) had inconsistent integration points and shape functions, it was using pyramid points but degenerate hex functions, this made the element some 20 times more flexible than it should be, pyramid shape functions are used now. My main reason to look into this was to support all element types in the structural solver both for linear and nonlinear analysis, in principle that should be working now, but I still have tests to run. I took the opportunity to refactor the CElement family of classes, now the derived classes only deal with the shape specifics:; - Integration/extrapolation points, shape function and derivatives, are computed and stored at construction.; - Area/Volume computation in undeformed (reference) or deformed (current) coordinates. Generic actions like allocating data and computing gradients are done by the base class. For the latter I included one method for 2D and another for 3D, they only differ in the inversion of the Jacobian but being specialized nDim can be ""hardcoded"" which should allow for more compile time optimization.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; In a nutshell, we still solve a linear system to update the solution, but the approximate Jacobian is replaced by matrix-free products with the ""real"" Jacobian which are obtained by finite differences (each product requires the computation of the residual for a perturbed solution).; This linear system is much more ill-conditioned, and so in addition to the classical linear preconditioners, it is possible to use the traditional linear system as the preconditioner (you gotta love the kind of stuff SU2 lets you get away with sometimes).; This nesting makes each iteration potentially very expensive, it is crucial not to ""over solve"" the linear systems, and to use adaptive CFL to run always at the highest CFL possible. Notwithstanding the preconditioner madness, this also works for explicit solvers, but that may only be good enough for dual time methods with relatively small time steps. This seems to be good at converging problems that would otherwise not get past a limit cycle.; I do not expect it to be faster when that is not a problem.

The initial idea was to couple all solvers (flow, turbulence, etc.) but that makes the problem even more ill-conditioned and so I took a step back (as that also makes the implementation simpler...).; The skeleton of the coupled iteration exists in commit c97221b6f7dfd315dfceb9f59f8928790c78e0ce and it was functional... if anyone wants to take it further, it's there. ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags, or simply --",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1183:70,update,update,70,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1183,1,['update'],['update']
Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; In a previous PR the SST model implementation in the CTurbSSTSolver was corrected to use the vorticity magnitude to calculate the turbulent viscosity (mu_T). But this change was not copied in the relevant numerics class where mu_T is used to calculate production terms. This is probably going to break all the SST related regression tests, so I will ensure convergence of those cases and update regression values. ; ; ## Related Work; A relevant discussion to have here is whether to update the SST turbulence model according to a 2003 paper by Menter (author of the SST model): [Ten years of industrial experience with the SST turbulence model](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.460.2814&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

The `createSolver` routine is a generic one that simply calls `new`. The others have some additional checks or calls for the construction.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; In some cases we use relative frame for rotor zone to perform URANS, e.g., in aeroelasticity analysis, we want the grid movement comes only from blade deformation. The problem is that the sliding plane in SU2 works only for absolute frame. In relative frame, the grid is not rotating, so the interpolation at sliding interface is not changed as time step is marching. The proposed changes rotate the sliding interface in accordance with physical time steps to perform interpolation. This function is activated only for relative frame. The grid itself is not rotating.; Currently, this is only implemented in CNearestneighbor class, other interpolation method should be changed as well in the near future. ## Related Work; *Resolve any issues (bug fix or feature request), note any related PRs, or mention interactions with the work of others, if any.*. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Multi-passage or full-annulus simulation is very important for turbomachinery case. For example, say one wants to simulate the circumferential features like rotating-stall or inlet distortion effect. Usually one first conducts single-passage RANS computation, then starts multi-passage or even full-annulus URANS from that converged single-passage solution. To do this in SU2, one meets two problems:; 1) Replicate the single-passage grid to user-defined number of passages (including full-annulus); 2) Replicate the single-passage solution. The proposed changes solve the two above mentioned problems.; This function is one of a series of features that enable SU2 to run URANS for turbomachinery cases, which have been shared to the SU2-Turbo group recently. ; This function has been used for my research for almost one year.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; On a user-specified upstream half-plane, fix the values of turbulence quantities to their far-field values, instead of integrating the turbulence model equations. In the far-field flow, the production terms of SST for K and omega are zero, while destruction still takes place. Thus the turbulence quantities typically decay on their way from the far-field boundary to the airfoil, until they reach the `lowerlimit`. See for instance this turbulence kinetic energy plot on the NACA0012 mesh:; ![kk_sst_copr_TKE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72806890/111277953-4f805380-8639-11eb-8d34-466e612aac4e.png). This has been presented in [1] together with two solution approaches:; - *Sustaining terms*, which are additional source terms compensating the destruction terms in the far-field flow. This approach has been already implemented with the `KIND_TURB_MODEL= SST_SUST` option.; ![kk_sst_copr_sust_TKE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72806890/111278024-60c96000-8639-11eb-8b1b-f4e95a3f97ab.png); - *Floor values*, which is equivalent to set the `lowerlimit` to the far-field values in the upstream region of the airfoil.; This PR adds floor values, but in the form of *fixed values*: The turbulence quantities are just set to the far-field values in the upstream region. This has been implemented in analogy to the strong boundary conditions. The correction can be activated like this:. TURB_FIXED_VALUES= YES; TURB_FIXED_VALUES_DOMAIN= -1.0. The second parameter specifies the half-plane on which fixed values are applied. This half-plane consists of those points for which the dot product of their coordinate vector with the normalized far-field velocity vector is less than `TURB_FIXED_VALUES_DOMAIN`. .

This seems to be due to floating-point errors in `CSourcePieceWise_TurbSST::SetReynoldsStressMatrix`, `CAvgGrad_Base::SetReynoldsStressMatrix`. These little deviations (relative difference around 1e-16) are probably amplified over the 10 iterations, so that the solver takes a notably different path to the steady state solution and the intermediate logarithmic residuals differ. I checked (for the `1c` and `2c` test cases) that the converged solutions are nearly equal though.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; Similar to the quasi-Newton acceleration provided by `CQuasiNewtonInvLeastSquares`, the proposed toolbox class `CNewtonUpdateOnSubspace` performs a correction on adjoint solution updates by keeping track of past iterates. Here, they are used to identify eigenvectors with large eigenvalues which slow down the overall convergence and to form a (small) subspace basis from them. Each fixed-point solution update is then [projected onto that subspace and the projected part will be additionally corrected via a ""real"" Newton step (a.k.a. ""RPM"")](https://doi.org/10.1137/0730057) using the computational graph for precise derivative information. This preliminary result with one basis vector indicates that the procedure can be effective at very low additional cost (for n basis vectors, it mainly reduces to n scalar products of the current fixed-point iterate with the basis vectors, the Newton step is cheap as n is small).

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; The CRot value was set to 1.0 for the HLPW5 but the standard value is 2.0 as suggested in TMR. Plus, there may be some inconsistencies with the negative branch of SA when used with the R variant. $\hat{S}$ should be used in the computation of the production term when $\hat{\nu}>0$. When $\hat{\nu}<0$, instead, the vorticity $\Omega$ should be used together with the $c_{t3}$ constant. Citing TMR:. ""This model is the same as the ""standard"" version (SA), except that the (SA-R) production term becomes: . $c_{b1}(1-f_{t2})[\hat{S}+C_{rot}min(0,S-\Omega)]\hat{\nu}$. ... However, a negative production term is not acceptable for the negative branch ($\hat{\nu} < 0$) of the (SA-neg) model. If coding (SA-neg-R), a possible C0 continuous production term in the negative (SA-neg-R) branch is the following: . $c_{b1}(1-c_{t3})[\hat{\Omega}+C_{rot}min(0,S-\Omega)]\hat{\nu}$. "". I don't understand if the second production term has to be used everytime SA-neg is considered or only at the points where $\hat{\nu}<0$.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; The hybrid parallel implementation uses grid coloring (edge and element) to avoid race conditions when building the residual vector and Jacobian matrix.; Depending on grid size, type, and ordering, it may be difficult to find a good coloring, i.e. providing locality and enough parallelism (all threads getting almost the same number of work chunks to work on per color). This PR extends the use of the ""reducer strategy"" to fine grids (introduced and described in #861 for coarse grids, which before #894 I thought would be the only problematic scenarios) as a fallback strategy that is automatically selected when the coloring efficiency (highlighted below) drops below a threshold value. The reducer strategy can be forced by setting EDGE_COLORING_GROUP_SIZE to 0 (for some cases it seems to give better performance, contrary to the initial assessment from #789).; For element loops (CFEASolver and CMeshSolver, modified in #843) an automatic fallback was also introduced, but using ""locks"" (explained below) as a ""reducer strategy"" would use too much memory, and element loops are more compute intensive (and therefore less affected by the overhead of using these locks). ## Related Work; Part of #789, namely:; Improves scaling of the work from #861 #843 (should help with #894); Fixes a bug from #830. ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [X] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.; - [X] I have updated appropriate documentation (Tutorials, Docs Page, config_template.cpp) , if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/908:1712,update,updated,1712,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/908,1,['update'],['updated']

The plan is to eventually have a consistent way of defining objective functions and/or define custom output quantities on individual surfaces. . I introduced a new structure to store scalar quantities for the history output. This makes it much easier to filter and loop through a specific subset of fields. Next step is to have per surface values stored in the same structure. Furthermore, creating structure to compute problem-specific outputs like aerodynamic coefficients, time-averaged quantities, surface quantities and so on. ## Related Work. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; The objective is to provide a natural (i.e. readable) way to write code that extracts all the performance modern CPU have to offer. As described in the last update of #789 this will require completely different numerics classes, also to address other inefficiencies they have. For now all centered schemes and plain Roe have been ""ported"" (this also adds JST with matrix dissipation).; Most of the auxiliary CNumerics functions were also ported as consequence (inviscid fluxes, Jacobians, and so on) and so implementing new schemes only gets easier. If you want to test this, the new numerics are called for Roe on ideal gas without low Mach corrections (enabled by option USE_VECTORIZATION=YES) and also for centered schemes.; To get good performance on gcc you need the following optimization flags:; `-O2 -funroll-loops -ffast-math -march=?? -mtune=??` Where ?? should be something with AVX (e.g. `haswell`, `skylake`).; There are AVX and AVX512 specific optimizations.; Also the OpenMP simd directive is used, at least on gcc this makes a difference (because it is stubborn at vectorizing) so -Dwith-omp=true when calling meson.py.; You can expect around 30% speedup +- 10% on problems that do not need a lot of linear solver iterations, or more on machines with AVX512. ## Related Work; #789. ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [X] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.; - [X] I have updated appropriate documentation (Tutorials, Docs Page, config_template.cpp) , if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1022:178,update,update,178,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1022,2,['update'],"['update', 'updated']"

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; There was a bug in the CTurbSolver::ComputeUnderRelaxation() that would return a negative UR if the change in solution was too negative (less than the allowable decrease), which could cause the solution to head in the wrong direction. I'm not really sure why the turbulent solver version of this function was written differently than the flow solver (maybe the intention was to have a different allowable increase and decrease but they ended up being the same in the end?), but I changed it to make it consistent with the flow solver version. Also, as I mentioned in #1036, the UR parameters for the flow solver and turbulent solver both took the min of each other and were never reset for steady, meaning it was non-increasing. While on the topic of UR, I was wondering what the community's thoughts are on changing the SST models to use UR instead of solution clipping. The limits seem somewhat arbitrary to me (is there a ref?), and the tests I've done on my mesh adaptation cases have performed well where I've replaced clipping with UR. I realize this is a very limited dataset so if anyone has any strong opinions of why we should be clipping, let me know. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; This PR adds a regression testing pipeline based on the new Github actions features (https://github.com/su2code/SU2/actions). It uses docker containers for building and running the tests (https://hub.docker.com/r/su2code/build-su2 and https://hub.docker.com/r/su2code/test-su2, respectively, based on Ubuntu18.04/gcc7.4/OpenMPI2). This has several advantages over the current (Travis based) system:. - Using the containers you can run the building/testing environment locally on your machine. You can even download the compiled binaries produced on github and run them locally to further debug problems.; - It is faster and more flexible. Compiling and running all tests requires ~1h since a lot of things run in parallel now (e.g. building the base, reverse AD and forward AD binaries). There is potential to further speed things up by splitting the test case scripts into several files. All of that requires minimal work. Unfortunately there is no caching using ccache at the moment, but it is likely that github introduces this feature mid of november. ; - Additional tests like unit tests can make use of the same docker containers and can be easily set up by creating a new workflow file.; - We can easily add a deployment step to automatically create releases and/or nightly builds. **Note:** the linked docker containers are **only** for development/testing purposes. Hence we cannot give any support in this regard. For production use it is recommended to use singularity containers. But: the docker containers can be used as basis layers for singularity.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; This PR fixes a couple issues in the nonlinear adaptive CFL scheme. - Convergence of the linear solver was assumed if the residual was greater than 0.5, which is quite large. I replaced this with the linear solver tolerance.; - The sum of nonlinear residuals was never computed for steady since `TimeIter` was used.; - The under-relaxation parameters for the flow solver and turbulent solver both took the min of each other and were never reset for steady, meaning it was non-increasing. @jayantmukho and I wanted to discuss more possible improvements to the scheme. I wanted to open this up before making any actual changes. - Currently there is a check for stalling residuals (the sum over 100 iterations of delta_Res must be > 0.1 Res), but this doesn't protect against increasing residuals. We should implement another check to prevent divergence.; - Instead of computing a single local CFL for flow/turbulence with a reduction factor for turbulence, maybe it would be better to have both solvers make their own call to `AdaptCFLNumber` and compute their own local CFL based on their own ResRMS. I feel like this would make more sense since the solvers are decoupled anyway. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply. You can fill this out after submitting the PR.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; This feature allows for computationally efficient through-flow computations for turbomachinery applications in the form of body-force modeling. The body-force model (BFM) generates density, momentum and energy source terms which turn the flow according to the local flow conditions and blade geometry. The blade geometry is defined through the camberline and blade thickness parameters, which are interpolated onto the mesh nodes prior to the solution process. ; Two BFM formulations are currently implemented: Hall (2015) and Thollet (2017). The code is up-to-date with ""develop"", version 7.1.1. ; Upcoming milestones will be MPI integration and coupling with adjoint. The latter will allow for computationally efficient design workflows of turbomachinery components. This will be especially useful for distortion-tolerant machines, as the design variable count and computational requirements are significantly higher than for machines experiencing uniform inflow. ; . ## Related Work; *Resolve any issues (bug fix or feature request), note any related PRs, or mention interactions with the work of others, if any.*. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; This is a simple re-shuffling to have matrix-vector products (and therefore linear systems) that are aware of periodic connections.; It uses something like:; - A ""`PERIODIC_RESIDUAL`"" communication (sum contributions) applied to the result of matrix-vector products.; - A ""`PERIODIC_IMPLICIT`"" communication (enforce periodicity) applied to the result of preconditioners. It seems to avoid the performance degradation that @TobiKattmann saw when implementing periodicity for heat transfer, and also the issues in issue #1467. However, making the matrix-vector product ""periodicity-aware"" through comms, without modifying the matrix, means that any preconditioner derived from the matrix is not consistent with the product, thus it is a worse preconditioner and more linear iterations are needed for the same reduction in residuals. ## Related Work; Should help #1467; Should avoid #763. ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags, or simply --warnlevel=2 when using meson).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [X] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.; - [X] I have updated appropriate documentation (Tutorials, Docs Page, config_template.cpp) , if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1585:1333,update,updated,1333,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1585,1,['update'],['updated']
Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; This is a slight modification to the computation of face normals. Previously, the inputs to SetCoord_CG were swapped depending on whether iPoint < jPoint, but this can result in an inconsistent direction for the normals of each sub-face associated with edge i/j (i.e. for each element connected to edge i/j). This logic is replaced by dotting the sub-face normals with the edge vector from i to j (or j to i if iPoint > jPoint), and flipping the normal if the product is negative.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; This is a solver I have been working on for some time.; The proposed solver is a treatment of the discrete adjoint sensitivities based on the idea of Sobolev gradient smoothing. This is done by solving an elliptic PDE with the sensitivities, i.e., ( e1 Id - e2 Laplace) delta_x = - dF / dx, with different weights e1, e2.; Such treatment can help prevent noise in the derivative computation and leads to smoother design updates. Especially, when working in a One Shot optimization context.; The new solver constructs the necessary operator and solves it using the finite elements features in SU2. It also includes the possibility to take the mesh parameterization into account and smooth the sensitivities w.r.t. the design parameters. I will update this draft and the comments, but I wanted to share this first version. I would be happy if anyone wants to comment on it.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; This pull request represents progress towards exposing the mesh deformation routines and their adjoint counterparts to Python through pysu2 and pysu2ad, respectively. This refactorization introduced:. 1. `CDriverBase`; a. Parent class for `CDriver`, `CDeformationDriver`, `CDiscAdjDeformationDriver`; b. Common methods regarding geometry, markers, MPI, etc. 2. `CDeformationDriver` and `CDiscAdjDeformationDriver`. In addition, the `CDeformationDriver` was modified to use the new mesh deformation solver `CMeshSolver`. The integration of `CMeshSolver` required introducing the `numerics_container` and `solver_container`, as well as minor changes to `CMeshSolver` (e.g., `DeformMesh` and `SetMesh_Stiffness`). Both the legacy mesh deformation solver `SU2_DEF` and the newer `CMeshSolver` can be used with these new drivers, depending on how the `DEFORM_MESH` option is set in the SU2 config file. . ## Related Work; These efforts are related to Issue #1262. The purpose of this work is to enable the coupling of SU2 with external solvers like Nastran, particularly for aerostructural MDAO. The goal is to apply this for coupled discrete adjoint sensitivities. . In the future, these driver classes will be extended to include more methods accessible via Python (i.e., for setting or extracting variables, config parameters, etc.). Currently `CDiscAdjDeformationDriver` is not integrated with `CMeshSolver`, but this will be addressed in the future. . ## PR Checklist; - [X] I am submitting my contribution to the develop branch.; - [X] My contribution generates no new compiler warnings (try with the '-Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-empty-body' compiler flags, or simply --warnlevel=2 when using meson).; - [X] My contribution is commented and consistent with SU2 style.; - [ ] I have added a test case that demonstrates my contribution, if necessary.; - [ ] I have updated appropriate documentation (Tutorials, Docs Page, config_template.cpp) , if necessary.",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1300:545,integrat,integration,545,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1300,3,"['integrat', 'update']","['integrated', 'integration', 'updated']"

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; To simulate a gust in CFD, typically the Field Velocity Method is used. This method prescribes a given velocity on each node and neglects any influence of the aircraft on the gust. The Split Velocity Method is an approach that allows to capture the influence of the aircraft on the gust. . As far a I understand, the Split Velocity Method is only partially implemented in SU2 and isn't used for any gust type because all gust derivatives are zero / commented out in the code.

Deployability,"## Proposed Changes; With steady computations, the pywrapper call to `SU2Driver.Run()` will run it for the number of iterations in the config file. The first change this PR makes is that a call to `SU2Driver.Preprocess(nIter)` will overwrite the number of inner iterations when the case is not time dependent. We can now do `SU2Driver.Run()` for a single iteration by setting `SU2Driver.Preprocess(1)`. A call to `SU2Driver.Monitor(Iter)` will check the stopping criteria, including the maximum number of iterations. When you have set this to 1 using `SU2Driver.Preprocess(1)`, a call to `SU2Driver.Monitor(0)` will still stop the calculations because we are checking if (iter+1)>=nIter. The second change is that we now check if (iter >= nIter). I also change this behavior for time dependent problems to make this behavior consistent. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Note: For some reason this fixes a problem for the species transport, where the discrete adjoint solver would stop in computelimiters.hpp with the message ""unknown limiter type"". This only happens when a computation is run over more than one node (more than one core is OK though). This is because in CSolver::SetSolution_Limiter, GetKind_SlopeLimit() does not return a valid value for an existing slope limiter. Kind_SlopeLimit is set in CConfig::SetKind_ConvNumScheme, called in CConfig::SetGlobalParam, but this looks OK to me. .

Deployability,"## Proposed changes. Dear all,. I am very new to collaboration on a open source project, but I have been working on an update for the FSI computation in python that I think may be useful also for other researcher. Would you mind giving me a feedback about the modifications?. In few words, I have updated the python interface for fluid structure interaction to the new version of SU2, including the new driver, the new mesh deformation methods and few other modifications in the python scripts. It works with python3. As far as the C++ code is concerned, I only added the possibility to separate the symmetry boundary conditions for the fluid solver from the ones of the mesh solver. There is an explanation of this modification in the ReadMe file in SU2_PY/FSI_tools, together with an example of application. . The interface is still general and new structural solvers can be coupled by adding it to the fsi_computation.py file. With the present pull request I only include one structural solver, which provides a coupling with the commercial code Nastran. I added ReadMe files to explain in detail all the modifications and also the keywords to be used in the config files. Finally, there is also a complete test case where the flutter of a flat plate is studied. I am looking forward for your comments.

Deployability,"## Summary; The fluid should freely pass a fluid interface between RANS zones. However, in some unsteady 2D simulations, I encountered the interface generating unexpected flow solutions which is observed through the increased eddy viscosity and unphysical velocity as the inner zone rotates with respect to the stationary outer zone.

Deployability,") then a good approach is to ; 1. make your `enum` of choice an `enum class` and remove the associated numbers. ; 2. Rename here if reasonable, i,.e. `ENUM_INLET_TYPE` can be just `INLET_TYPE`. Also the option names to not be redundant so e.g. `INLET_TYPE::PRESSURE_INLET_TYPE` could become `INLET_TYPE::PRESSURE`; 3. Add a `NONE` or `NO_THING` option if needed. Often the global `NONE` option is and that made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move 🧙 ; 2. then you go to `CConfig.c/hpp` and change the option type and everything there (because in the `CConfig` class the variable is usually defined). Find the `GetKind_yourOption` and search the code base for that `Get` function.; 3. Once all search results and the following function bodies are changed just compile and fix until the code builds; 4. Special care for switch statements: If not all options are present make a `default; break;` line -> otherwise the automated builds will fail on a warning (clang is used, I found gcc does only complain with an additional flag); 4. commit at best just 1 commit with a clear message and push. That makes reverting easier if it fails and introduced some non-obvious error; ; Have fun :). ## Related Work; #1242. ## PR Checklist; *Put an X by all that apply.

Deployability,"**Context**; I am working in a parallel MDO framework where one or several instances of SU2 (corresponding to different operating cases) can coupled with other solvers and tools, to perform coupled aero-structural shape optimisation. . The framework initialises MPI and assigns processors to the different solvers and tools as required. The SU2 instances are initialised and controlled through Python, and given a communicator for the relevant subset of the MPI processes. . **Issue**; Shape optimisation with SU2 (using discrete adjoints) require four operations at each major optimisation iteration:. 1. `SU2_DEF`: Deform the mesh according to the new design variables (or _design deformations_, in contrast to e.g. the _structural deformations_ in an aeroelastic analysis), and output the deformed mesh to file,; 2. `SU2_CFD`: Update the primal solution, which may include a mesh deformation due to structural deformations in an aeroelastic analysis, and output the converged state to file,; 3. `SU2_CFD_AD`: Update the discrete adjoint solution corresponding to the converged primal solution, once for each objective function of interest, and output the converged adjoints to file,; 4. `SU2_DOT_AD`: Calculate the surface sensititivities from the discrete adjoint solution (from what I can gather, this step is required in the discrete-adjoint sensitivity analysis to account for the in-direct influence surface deformations have on the objective through the volume deformation; essentially a differentiation of `SU2_DEF`), and output these to file. Currently, the SU2 Python wrapper exposes _driver_ classes which allow control of the execution of steps 2 and 3 described above, namely `CSinglezoneDriver` and `CDiscAdjSinglezonedriver` (among other variants). For steps 1 and 4 however, there is no such option: these steps must be executed by a ""command-line call"" in a newly spawned sub-process, as is done in the SU2 Python tools, in `SU2.run.DEF` and `SU2.run.DOT` respectively.

Using the FAN_FACE_MACH boundary condition, which is implemented in the `CEulerSolver.cpp`, the `Inflow_Mach_old` returned is 0.0, causing the computation of the updated pressure to be incorrect. In practice, this drives the pressure lower and lower until it becomes negative.

So it seems the main issue is that in the `config` the `Inflow_Mach` quantity is never getting updated. I _believe_ this should happen in `src/solvers/CEulerSolver.cpp` starting at line 2855 `if (Engine) { ... ` . Here, a call to `config->SetInflow_Mach(iMarker_Inlet, Inlet_Mach_Total[iMarker_Inlet]);` is completely missing. I'm not familiar with the code base, so I'm not sure if it is supposed to be updated elsewhere. However, inserting that line appears to fix the problem and the above logic around FAN_FACE_MACH begins working as expected. **Reproduce**; Perhaps the only thing about my problem worth mentioning is it is ran as axisymmetric. I'm running RANS, with the SST model. . **Desktop (please complete the following information):**; - OS: [e.g., Linux (Centos 7)]; - C++ compiler and versi",MatchSource.ISSUE,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1607:238,update,updated,238,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1607,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"**Describe the bug**. You will have to bear with me, I might get some of this wrong, I am not entirely sure what is going on here so I will try and include as much information as possible. Using the tape tagging method developed by @oleburghardt in #2343 and presented at the most recent SU2 Conference, a run of the full tape reveals that a variable used in a preaccumulation output is not properly recorded. The variable is the `val` in the function `PassiveAssign` in `CSysMatrix.hpp` line 215. `FORCEINLINE static ScalarType PassiveAssign(const SrcType& val) {; return SU2_TYPE::GetValue(val);; }`. Following the call stack of the error reveals that the problem variables in `val` are the jacobian components calculated in the Roe and JST scheme (these are the two options I have tested). It is possible to resolve this error by simply moving the stopping of the preaccumulation region from before the call to `updateLinearSystem` in the `ComputeFlux` method of both these schemes, to after, as show below. `/*--- Update the vector and system matrix. ---*/. updateLinearSystem(iEdge, iPoint, jPoint, implicit, updateType,; updateMask, flux, jac_i, jac_j, vector, matrix);. /*--- Stop preaccumulation. ---*/. stopPreacc(flux);`. However, whilst this resolve the error in this location, the next error appears in the Giles boundary condition. Here the two jacobian components within the residual object are not recorded correctly in the preaccumulation output region also. This in `CEulerSolver.cpp:6556`. `/*--- Compute the residual using an upwind scheme ---*/; auto residual = conv_numerics->ComputeResidual(config);. /*--- Update residual value ---*/; LinSysRes.AddBlock(iPoint, residual);`. I have tried simpy adding these components as preacc outputs however they are SIMD arrays and the datatype cannot be converted using the existing implementation. . I am not sure what is going on here, or the next steps to resolve this problem.

Hi all,. The STL-file writer does not write quad surface elements (So far so good :) ). So in case of a Hexa-Grid (i.e. quad surface elements) the .stl is pretty much empty, which is not really what we want.; I will attach an image later (firewall's at it again) down below which shows a mixed surface mesh (tris and quads). On the left will be the current version of SU2 where quads are simply not written and on the right a fixed version where each quad is separated into 2 tris. ![stl_quads_tris](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31306376/58827759-17667700-8644-11e9-9e6f-4643d2e7fdb7.JPG). That was found (and fixed) by Fabian Woerenkaemper @ElGarno . As the output is currently overhauled, I shortly chatted with its adoptive father @talbring and I will adapt the fixed STL-writer to the new structure and it will (hopefully) go into develop with that in a somewhat near future. If you desperately ;) need that fix right now, I can add a patch for the current develop down below.

Running valgrind gives the error; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41386609/97629439-580a2180-19eb-11eb-9e9f-023fc96c05aa.png); which for my version corresponds to this line; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41386609/97629473-66f0d400-19eb-11eb-89c8-9b677c720240.png); It seems that theres a mismatch on the receiver end. The problem disappears if I use smaller number of cores, e.g. 64, and everything will look normal (solution converges and SU2 exit normally). The actual number of MPI cores that triggers the bug seems to be problem dependent. I also ran a couple of finer grids but started to see the bug with 64 cores. For these finer mesh, reducing to a smaller number like 48 cores makes the problem disappear again. Similar problem has been observed by @clarkpede and mentioned in pecos-hybrid/su2#53 but he was using an older version of SU2 (v6.2.0).
