Since just like the problem with 1) above there seems to be switch of the column 12 to 10 and you are observing weird looking file. . In short: Everything is fine till column 9th but there is a bug which makes column 12 to 10, 10 to 11 and 11 to 12. If you provide `--dumpUmiGraph` then last two columns represents `mRnaFraction	rRnaFraction` while everything in between column 9th and before last two represents `ArborescenceCount` with special frequency dump as defined above. My apologies for the trouble I just pushed a fix into the develop branch. However, we have significant other changes in develop branch too so recompilation might make your current index incompatible to `0.14.1` so if you don't wan't to reindex the reference then I'd not recompile from develop and the bugfix will available from the next version. Solution: The easiest solution is to remove `--dumpUMIgraph` if you don't need the flag and rerun then the only thing to handle is just change the header names. If rerunning alevin is too much work then I can forward you a python parser which can temporary handle the parsing.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/413#issuecomment-518443482:1946,avail,available,1946,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/413#issuecomment-518443482,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability," BAM file is provided. ; If the BAM files are provided one at a time, no error or segfault happens and salmon wickedly fast quantificates the transcripts. The first used BAM files where shuffled (with samtools bamshuf) as recommended in the docs. To exclude an error on my side I did:; - try unshuffled BAM files --> Segfault; - try older Salmon Version (7.2) --> Segfault; - build Salmon from source --> Segfault; - use different transcriptdata (see below) --> Segfault. The segfault happens after all reads (in all files) are processed:; `processed 48000000 reads in current roundSegmentation fault`. ### Example workflow:. Get the read data from [here](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?run=ERR1433122) for example with SRA Toolkit:; `vdb-dump -f fastq --gzip --output-file test.fastq.gz ERR1433122`. Then use STAR:.

Now make a copy of the ""Aligned.toTranscriptome.out.bam"" (for the sake of simplicity) and try; `salmon quant -l A -a Aligned.toTranscriptome.out.bam Aligned.toTranscriptome.out_copy.bam -t gff_merged.fa -o ./out/`.

Availability," I did perform a random subsampling, ie. taking a read with a p probability while reading the fastq files, p being the subsampling coefficient I did mention (pE[0;1]). An implementation of this approach as an option during the transcript quantification would be great. I can provide you with the simple python script I use for the subsampling, but I am not sure if it is the proper way to subsample during alevin quantification. >when you say cellranger subsampling, do you mean the cellranger aggregate pipeline?. Yes, sorry for not clearly stating it. I did use the cellranger aggregate function indeed, which by default subsample the expression matrices with high sequencing depth depending on amount of mapped reads, if I understand well. >Use Alevin w/o any modification to the fastq on both of your sample to generate the gene count matrices. I already did that, in downstream analyses I have a batch effect issue related to the sequencing depth. >that's why we recommend using the Seurat package downstream of the Alevin quantified matrices. I have some experience with downstream analyses with Seurat, Pagoda, Scater, scanpy and a few other tools, and I am aware of batch correction methods like CCA or MNN. But that is not what I am looking for here. I did both CCA and MNN but I loose some important information in the resulting eigenspaces or corrected matrix. I believe the proper way to correct my batch effect is to simply fix the difference between my two libraries, ie. the sequencing depth in this case. As I explained in my first message, cellranger aggregate (subsampling based on the amount of mapped reads) works very well in my case, correct the effect without any loss or modification of important genes in our scientific question. Not CCA or MNN. I would like to be able to do the same from the alevin quantifications. So I am looking for a proper way to apply a correction before/during/after the alevin quantification, in a way similar to what cellranger do with STAR.

Availability," I’ve done some sleuthing and have (seemingly) figured out what’s going on. I compared tons of overlapping transcript scenarios and played with the salmon options and concluded the following:. 1. **Success scenarios:** Generally, with default options, Salmon does an excellent job at assigning reads to overlapping transcripts the same way that a human would. Whether or not the transcripts overlap slightly or one is entirely contained within another is irrelevant. 2. **Failure scenarios:** In some scenarios with overlapping transcripts, read assignment can be very strange and unintuitive, especially when one of the transcript isoforms is much more abundant than the other (the abundant transcript tends to “steal” reads from the less abundant one). 3. Both the success and failure scenarios are **due to the length bias model** used when estimating the abundance of transcripts. **Totally disabling this with the —noLengthCorrection flag** (NOT the —no**Effective**LengthCorrection flag) **actually *creates* the transcript within a transcript failure scenario that I mistakenly thought was the original issue.** That is, when length bias modeling is turned off, then longer transcripts will always get assigned *all* of the reads that multimap to shorter transcripts.; -Therefore... if you *did* want to tackle the transcript within a transcript scenario to build a coverage bias model, you probably want to disable the length bias modeling or at least consider how it would interact with coverage modeling. With that said, I'm sharing an example that illustrates each of the above points and a link to a toy dataset that you can use to recreate the examples or explore this further. If you'd like to dig deeper into this, free free to e-mail me at jason@calicolabs.com, I have tons more notes and data that I'm willing to share.

Availability," [alevin-fry tutorial](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-fry-tutorials/2021/improving-txome-specificity/). . **Describe the bug**; A clear and concise description of what the bug is. I have previously followed the steps outlined in the alevin-fry tutorial for a single sample and everything worked as expected. Now I am following the same steps but wrapped in a snakemake pipeline to process several samples and am running into issues building the index. Specifically, I am receiving the following error when my pipeline moves on the mapping reads step:. ```; Exception : [Error: The index version file /beevol/home/winklerc/projects/scifi_pipeline/scifi/ref/idx/complete_ref_lens.bin/versionInfo.json doesn't seem to exist. Please try re-building the salmon index.]; alevin (sc-align) was invoked improperly.; ```. I have tried re-building the index, and have also tried reusing the index that I had previously built for the single sample run that previously worked. However, neither of those approaches fixed the above error. When I build the index I am able to generate all of the expected files and the file sizes match those of my previous (successful) index build, so I am not sure why I am getting an error that the `versionInfo.json` file is missing. **To Reproduce**; Steps and data to reproduce the behavior:. I followed the alevin-fry tutorial to generate a splici transcriptome, using the same [Human reference (GRCh38) dataset](https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A.tar.gz) provided by the tutorial.

Availability," a 21 GiB swap partition which works fine (I've already seen it at 60%, so it is active and recognized and everything despite being on another physical hard drive ; (the 1. hard drive has a dual installation of win 10 and ubuntu 20.4 and the swap from the installation (2 GiB, because I thought that would be enough at the time and tried to save some space ^^) and the 2. hard drive has a swap partition of 20 GiB (with the highest priority of all swaps), which results in a total of 21.4 GiB in the System Monitor Resources Tab). . The system is still responding, and the System Monitor seems to be working fine (salmon is an active process using 12% CPU, 6.9 GiB memory, 13.5 GiB Disk read total, N/A Disk write total, Disk read 1.2 MiB/s (sometimes 1.1 or 1.3), Disk write N/A, Priority normal); and the Resources Tab shows that ; * out of 8 available CPUs, one is working at 100% (the others 5% at max) and ; * Memory 99.3% (which is only 7.7 GiB); * swap 9.5% (which is only 2 GiB of 21.4 GiB available). So here are (finally) my questions:. 1. How can I get Salmon to use the swap (I set swappiness to 100, and it still doesn't seem to care about the swap); 2. Is it normal that there is nothing ""visible"" happening during Round0?; 3. How can I see or check if it is still working (and it might be worthwhile to wait longer)? ; 4. Is what I'm doing correct to create an index file for running Salmon on human RNA-seq data that is supposed to ""end up"" in sleuth?; 5. Is there another way to create an index file that I can use as an index file to create input data for sleuth from RNA-seq data using Salmon (that might need less computational power)?.

In addition, I am only using trimmed paired-end reads of 100bp. An example of a concern (See Table below) I have is that when I run Genes A, B, C, and D I get a certain set a results. However, when I run all the genes together (Genes A-E), the results from Gene C and Gene D are drastically different, but this is only under certain parameters (red highlight).

It's possible you are talking about some other step which I am not aware of but if it's `aggregate` then I think it happens downstream of all the quantification. Indeed coverage bias correction is an important part of the aggregation step but in general it's not the only one and that's why we recommend using the `Seurat` package downstream of the Alevin quantified matrices. We will be more than happy to write a tutorial on, ""how to perform batch correction downstream of Alevin"" but in summary the following steps would be the gist of the process.; - Use Alevin w/o any modification to the `fastq` on both of your sample to generate the gene count matrices. (We have made a major upgrade to the Alevin. We'd recommend using [v0.12.0-alpha](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/v0.12.0-alpha) for now, we are planning to make an official release before the end of this week, currently you can use pre-release. Unfortunately, not available on conda yet).; - Import Alevin count matrices into R using [this](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2018/alevin-seurat/) tutorial .; - Use [this](https://satijalab.org/seurat/immune_alignment.html) to perform the batch correction. ; We do realize it's currently complicated to use things downstream of Alevin and are working constantly on improving the overall pipeline to make the analyses as smooth as possible. If you happen to write a tutorial of your own on doing the analyses, we'd be happy to include that in Alevin tutorial page.

Availability," help me with that, but if you have thoughts, I'd appreciate them! Anyway, I decided arbitrarily to use the long-read BAMs as input to Salmon. ### Bug description; Secondly, as discussed a little in #104 , I keep running into:; `Transcript NM_032515.5 appears in the reference but did not appear in the BAM`; and; `Transcript chr19 appeared in the BAM header, but was not in the provided FASTA file`; (note here that it's an entire chromosome??? And these are the only ""transcripts"" that don't appear in the fasta- they're all just the chromosome names.); This happened regardless of whether I used the Stringtie fasta or the SQNATI-annotated fasta. This is the salmon command I had run:; `$salmon quant --ont -t $transcriptome -l SF -a $bam -o $outdir/$name`. As suggested, I used gffread to generate a new transcriptome fasta as follows:; `gffread -w salmon_fix.fa -g chm13v2.0.fa chm13v2.0_RefSeq_Liftoff_v5.1.gff3`. I reran the above salmon command using this new fasta file, but got the same error and warnings: there are transcripts in the BAM not in the fasta and vice versa. Again, the ""transcripts"" not in the fasta were chromosome names. I also tried with the short read SAM files, and still got the same error. I'm not sure how to fix either the warnings or the errors and would really appreciate your help. ### Software information; I used salmon v1.10.0 (though I also tried v1.10.1). In the case of v1.10.0, I had downloaded the pre-compiled binary, and in the case of v1.10.1, the admins of the HPC cluster I used installed it- not sure how. Regardless, all the runs were on HPC clusters, which run on Linux CentOS (I use two different HPC clusters, depending on their availability).

Availability," here with alevin, so it would mis-detect cells like the shifted ones you pasted above. For SPLiT-seq, we do know exactly which barcodes go into the wells, however, so it is technically possible to restrict based on all possible known combinations of barcodes instead and be more positionally flexible. But deciding how many indel bases are allowable, and presumably doing multiple passes through the data to establish an include-list could be time-consuming. Further, the zUMIs developer rightly mentions [in this thread](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/issues/63) that there are likely going to be _many_ unused barcode combinations this way, so lots of time could be spent looking for ""cells"" that don't actually exist in the data. The authors of the paper from which our test dataset was derived describe in their methods using a Drop-seq computational framework, so I'm not sure which approach theirs is more similar to. . The simplest approach here is certainly the automatic detection, but it will come at the cost of losing meaningful reads to frameshift errors. . My guess is this falls well out of the scope of alevin, but if you're interested in improving on that, there may be a middle ground between the two approaches above, one that I'm not sure if your group or others have attempted for other methods: we could essentially do a 2-pass barcode detection. The first pass would restrict based on positions like we're already doing, and establish an include-list of possible barcodes seen in the data. Then we could pass through the barcode sequences a second time, looking only for those sequence combinations, but allowing 1-2bp flexibility in the positions they occur, potentially rescuing some of the ones missed during the first pass.

Availability," protocols, it is usually the case that we get 1 read -> 1 transcript, even if we don't read the whole thing. We have tested the effect of this in ONT data with spike ins, and have verified that using `--noLengthCorrection` does generally lead to improved accuracy with respect to quantification estimates. We have informed ONT of this, and I would guess they may optimize the flags that are used soon (we have also developed an error model that works correctly for these long reads, and that should make it into the next release of salmon). Regarding the effect this has on the `NumReads` values reported by salmon, it's not as simple as with the `TPM` estimates. The length affects the assigned reads through the probabilistic model on which inference is done. With the length effect we have that P(f | t_i) ∝ P( position | f, t_i ) * P( alignment | f, t_i) --- forgetting the alignment term for the time being, we have that with length correction P( position | f, t_i ) ∝ 1 / l_i and without length correction the l_i term goes away. In other words, the probability of allocating reads has a term that depends on the effective length when the `--noLengthCorrection` flag is not passed, but that term goes away when it is passed. This is not quite as drastic as with TPM where the normalization includes the length directly in the normalization (note, however, that when the `--noLengthCorrection` flag is passed, this adjusts the TPM as well). Further, the `NumReads` is still better than TPM in this regard because it still encodes the effect size (i.e. `NumReads` will sum to the total number of aligned reads). Anyway TLDR: Passing the `--noLengthCorrection` flag *is* better for ONT data, though results without this flag are sub-optimal, they are not unusable. We have let ONT know about this, and I would suspect they will address it (perhaps they'll even accept a PR?). Finally, a long read error model has been created and will _hopefully_ make it to the next version of salmon.

Availability," subsampling the Fastq, did you sample randomly across the full Fastq or chose the top X reads. Yes, I did perform a random subsampling, ie. taking a read with a p probability while reading the fastq files, p being the subsampling coefficient I did mention (pE[0;1]). An implementation of this approach as an option during the transcript quantification would be great. I can provide you with the simple python script I use for the subsampling, but I am not sure if it is the proper way to subsample during alevin quantification. >when you say cellranger subsampling, do you mean the cellranger aggregate pipeline?. Yes, sorry for not clearly stating it. I did use the cellranger aggregate function indeed, which by default subsample the expression matrices with high sequencing depth depending on amount of mapped reads, if I understand well. >Use Alevin w/o any modification to the fastq on both of your sample to generate the gene count matrices. I already did that, in downstream analyses I have a batch effect issue related to the sequencing depth. >that's why we recommend using the Seurat package downstream of the Alevin quantified matrices. I have some experience with downstream analyses with Seurat, Pagoda, Scater, scanpy and a few other tools, and I am aware of batch correction methods like CCA or MNN. But that is not what I am looking for here. I did both CCA and MNN but I loose some important information in the resulting eigenspaces or corrected matrix. I believe the proper way to correct my batch effect is to simply fix the difference between my two libraries, ie. the sequencing depth in this case. As I explained in my first message, cellranger aggregate (subsampling based on the amount of mapped reads) works very well in my case, correct the effect without any loss or modification of important genes in our scientific question. Not CCA or MNN. I would like to be able to do the same from the alevin quantifications.

Availability," the right end of the transcript which is inconsistent with the coverage profile and, as hoped, salmon did not assign any reads to that variant. So, in these two scenarios the default options produce nice results in line with our human intuition. 2. **Failure scenario with default options:** ; ![PDI1_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10292386/86509895-3df36600-bda0-11ea-8f0b-df0de4fefa31.png); <img width=""383"" alt=""PDI1_table"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10292386/86509897-40ee5680-bda0-11ea-9566-9f2bdab464f0.png"">. In this example there are four genes (oriented in the same direction) with wildly different expression levels. I added a ""PDI1_SuperTranscript"" which stretches from the 5' end of PDI1 to the 3' end of POF1 (so, all reads from all 4 genes would multimap to the super transcript). This is a contrived example to illustrate the technical details, but you could imagine similar biological scenarios, especially regarding splicing isoforms. With the default options, you get the counterintuitive result that all of the reads from just MGR1 and POF1 (the two lowest abundance transcripts) are assigned to the super transcript. EMC1 loses ~50% of its reads to the super transcript, and PDI1 only loses ~10%. I'm not showing it, but if you remove the default PDI1 transcript from the index (so it's just the super transcript + the 3 genes MGR1/EMC1/POF1), all three of them lose all of their reads to the super transcript... meaning that whether or not EMC1 gets assigned any reads depends entirely on the presence of a non-overlapping gene, PDI1, in the salmon index. This is definitely at odds with our intuition from looking at the coverage plots, but makes sense when you break all the transcripts down to a simple reads per kb equation. As before, if you turn off length modeling then all of the reads get assigned to the super transcript. I hope this was insightful and cleared up the issue a bit. Feel free to e-mail or reply here.

Availability,"## Description of bug and how to reproduce. Short version: the error message telling users that -l has to go before -1 and -2 doesn’t always seem to work. I think I found an issue with the error messages from Salmon (in particular, I think a certain error message isn’t always reported when it should be). Long version of the story: I ran salmon (v1.6.0, installed with conda on linux, run on bulk data, mm10 data, both my own reference and a precomputed one) with the command:. ```; salmon quant -i $index -1 $read1 -2 $read2 –o res -l A --posBias –-validateMapping; ```. Where $index is the index, $read1 and $read2 are the reads. And it crashed without throwing an error, outputting:. ```; Logs will be written to Salmon_out/res/logs; [2022-01-20 13:56:19.915] [jointLog] [info] setting maxHashResizeThreads to 52; [2022-01-20 13:56:19.915] [jointLog] [info] Fragment incompatibility prior below threshold.

But no errors/no other outputs after that. I reran many times with slightly different settings, including different set of reads and a different reference with the same results, but only got an error when I ran: . ```; salmon quant -p 1 -i $index -1 $read1 -2 $read2 –o res_new -l OSR; ```.

Availability,"**Is the bug primarily related to salmon (bulk mode) or alevin (single-cell mode)?**. Alevin. **Describe the bug**. Maybe more of a support request than a bug. . I've got some of what I suspect is lower-quality drop-seq data. Running Alevin with default parameters yields very low mapping rates, presumably because elbow-finding is failing. Here's the barcode rank plot, you can see why it's having trouble, you might see an elbow if you squint a bit. . ![Drop-seq](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5775915/57308423-3d006f00-70de-11e9-8c59-47e55d060035.png). I know from the source publication that we expect 278 cells in this case. . Supplying --expectCells yields the boundary error above. For this to work I need to break out the big guns and use --forceCells, yes? What I would really like is to try --expectCells first to allow Alevin to be a little bit intelligent, and if that fails to use --forceCells. Is that a sensible approach?. If so, could we a) have an informative error code on the boundary error above such that I can easily detect that error and re-submit with --forceCells, or b) if this is generically useful have a flag in Alevin to do it directly?. **To Reproduce**; Steps and data to reproduce the behavior:. - cDNA reads in ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/microarray/data/experiment/MTAB/E-MTAB-7142/Control_6_R2.fastq.gz; - barcode reads in ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/microarray/data/experiment/MTAB/E-MTAB-7142/Control_6_R1.fastq.gz; - transcript/ gene mapping as: [transcript_to_gene.txt](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/files/3153221/transcript_to_gene.txt); - Run Alevin in drop-seq mode, salmon 0.13.1. **Expected behavior**; A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. **Screenshots**. ```; ### alevin (dscRNA-seq quantification) v0.13.1; ### [ program ] => salmon ; ### [ command ] => alevin ; ### [ libType ] => { ISR }; ### [ mates1 ] => { barcodes.fastq.gz }; ### [ mates2 ] => { cdna.fastq.gz }; ### [ dropseq ] => { }; #",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/362:688,error,error,688,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/362,1,['error'],['error']

The bug is primarily related to salmon, but I am using salmon to build an index for use with alevin-fry per the [alevin-fry tutorial](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-fry-tutorials/2021/improving-txome-specificity/). . **Describe the bug**; A clear and concise description of what the bug is. I have previously followed the steps outlined in the alevin-fry tutorial for a single sample and everything worked as expected. Now I am following the same steps but wrapped in a snakemake pipeline to process several samples and am running into issues building the index. Specifically, I am receiving the following error when my pipeline moves on the mapping reads step:. ```; Exception : [Error: The index version file /beevol/home/winklerc/projects/scifi_pipeline/scifi/ref/idx/complete_ref_lens.bin/versionInfo.json doesn't seem to exist.

The problem wasn't just line 110447, but many other lines that had more than 1 field. So the real question breaks down into: should the bfh.txt file have only 1 field per row (line)? If this is the case, then the input bfh.txt file is problematic. If not, then the parser function is problematic, as it should account for more than 1 field. **To Reproduce**; Steps and data to reproduce the behavior:.

Availability,"**tl;dr**: 3-tag sequencing methods for bulk RNA samples contain known sample indices and UMIs and thus resembles sc-RNA-seq read formats. Do you have a recommendation on how to use Salmon and / or Alevin to quantify gene expression for this data type?. Congratulations on the recent [alevin preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/24/335000)! The new algorithm to deduplicate UMIs looks awesome. I am wondering if you had a recommendation on how to leverage it for 3' tag sequencing of bulk samples. There are a number of protocols that focus on the 3' ends of transcripts to allow for cheap quantification of gene expression, e.g. - [BRB-seq](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/30/256594); - [Drug-seq](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06500-x); - [Quant-seq](https://www.lexogen.com/quantseq-3mrna-sequencing/). These methods combine conventional (known) sample-indices to label samples (or wells) with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). (I found [one question on this topic](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/108) in the salmon issue tracker from back in 2016). Here is the Drug-seq approach, for example:. ![Drug-seq](https://media.springernature.com/lw900/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-06500-x/MediaObjects/41467_2018_6500_Fig1_HTML.png). The resulting read data resembles that of single-cell approaches and requires deduplication of UMIs and quantification based on reads with a strong 3' bias. It seems analysis of this data could benefit a lot from the algorithms implemented in Alevin. Can this data be analyzed with Salmon and / or Alevin? Are there any pitfalls that I should be aware off?.

I was worried that including the premature RNA was causing a problem (e.g. if the reads emitted by these regions are caused by genomic DNA contamination). To rule out this possibility and experiment with an alternate tool to infer library format, I aligned the FASTQ files using HIAST2 and used RSeQC's infer_experiment.py python module using intronic and exonic features per gene in .bed format as input (http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/).

Oh, I also had to update automake and autoconf because the 2 year old versions on this system were not new enough. Is there a static binary version of salmon available for download, Linux 64 bit? It looks like the default links are that way anyway, and that would save me what looks like at least another day of fighting with Cmake to force it to actually build a working make file. . You are developing on something like a recent Fedora or Ubuntu? In my experience packages which use boost and cmake inevitably cause a great great deal of pain when they are built on platforms like Centos or RHEL where long term support is one of the goals.

Availability,"10x Genomics Chromium genomic DNA sequencing selects roughly one million barcodes at random with replacement from a possible pool of four million barcodes. Most errors likely result from DNA oligo synthesis rather than sequencing errors (intuition but unconfirmed). There's on other open source tool that does this task `ema preproc`: https://github.com/arshajii/ema#usage. The authors of `ema` have reported that correcting off-by-one errors is sufficient. Their tool corrects off-by-one errors by default, and can optionally correct off-by-two errors. Long Ranger Basic corrects off-by-two errors. The uncorrected barcode may be stored in the `RX:Z` tag.

I tried to make it simpler and simpler, so that's a salmon index I made myself with no decoys, just the gencode transcript fasta with the software version I'm trying to run (salmon 1.10.2, from the combinelab/salmon docker hub), gencode v43 (I know, it's a version behind, but it's what I'm using elsewhere...) and hg38. It's handling the barcodes fine and recovering approximately the right amount (it's a sub-library with a few hundred cells to check the quality of the library before sequencing the full experiment). But it's failing to quantitate any of the reads. Oddly, just quantitating the read1 file with; > salmon quant -i /ref/gencode.v43.transcripts/ -l ISR -r r1.fastq.gz -p 30 -o work/salmon_output. behaves as expected and prints this and proceeds. > [2023-08-17 22:21:17.619] [jointLog] [info] Computed 618403 rich equivalence classes for further processing; > [2023-08-17 22:21:17.619] [jointLog] [info] Counted 6085013 total reads in the equivalence classes; > [2023-08-17 22:21:17.632] [jointLog] [info] Number of mappings discarded because of alignment score : 166235099.

Availability,"3.32 reads per unique molecule. So it seems like the duplication rate might be closer to the SevenBridges estimate than the Alevin estimate. The Alevin documentation seems to suggest that cell/transcript/UMI triplets are being used for UMI collapsing (""identify potential PCR/sequencing errors in the UMIs, and performs hybrid de-duplication while accounting for UMI collisions""), so I'm at a loss as to why the difference is this large. I'm not too worried about numbers being different, but the UMI proportion is a concern to me, because sequencing is expensive, and it'd be good to have an idea of whether we need to further improve our library prep (which would certainly be the case for 9X duplication, but less important with 3-5X duplication). Is anyone able to explain how the UMI deduplication is applied in Salmon Alevin, or why it might be different from other analysis platforms?. * Which version of salmon was used? v1.9.0; * How was salmon installed (compiled, downloaded executable, through bioconda)?

In this example, there are two regions in KCC4 with obviously different coverage. Ideally we would be able to have a default KCC4 transcript and a truncated isoform in the salmon index, and it would assign the reads appropriately, even though all of the reads that map to the truncated form would also multimap to the long form. Again, you can see in the table that salmon assigns reads parsimoniously to both transcripts with the default options, but with the length bias modeling turned off ALL of the reads are assigned to the long transcript. I also added a third transcript to the right end of the transcript which is inconsistent with the coverage profile and, as hoped, salmon did not assign any reads to that variant. So, in these two scenarios the default options produce nice results in line with our human intuition. 2. **Failure scenario with default options:** ; ![PDI1_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10292386/86509895-3df36600-bda0-11ea-8f0b-df0de4fefa31.png); <img width=""383"" alt=""PDI1_table"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10292386/86509897-40ee5680-bda0-11ea-9566-9f2bdab464f0.png"">. In this example there are four genes (oriented in the same direction) with wildly different expression levels. I added a ""PDI1_SuperTranscript"" which stretches from the 5' end of PDI1 to the 3' end of POF1 (so, all reads from all 4 genes would multimap to the super transcript). This is a contrived example to illustrate the technical details, but you could imagine similar biological scenarios, especially regarding splicing isoforms. With the default options, you get the counterintuitive result that all of the reads from just MGR1 and POF1 (the two lowest abundance transcripts) are assigned to the super transcript. EMC1 loses ~50% of its reads to the super transcript, and PDI1 only loses ~10%.

It seems that the [`LibraryFormat` class](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/blob/a6a4fe0dcf71674a59eb901d5ec6933df40de7f2/src/LibraryFormat.cpp#L52) is performing this check, and that the string format method is producing all of this output on stderr. . I believe that the Salmon index I'm using contains some transcript sequences from the ""wrong"" strand, and it would be helpful if the program gave information about the observed mapping (maybe just the transcript sequence ID) so that I could track down the error during index generation. . It also seems that all of the above error output contains no line terminators, although maybe this has been fixed in a more recent version. ```; -bash-4.1$ salmon --version; version : 0.4.0; ```. cc @jmerkin",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/16:2427,down,down,2427,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/16,3,"['down', 'error']","['down', 'error']"

This is because reads that align to the same reference position can easily have come from alternative transcripts sharing the same underlying sequence.

Availability,"> Yes that's one aspect. But also, Salmon uses CIGAR to evaluate alignment probability in alignment quantification mode no?. Indeed. > And with just RapMap output you would lose other information that Salmon uses to determine likely fragment assignment?. You would lose information (in the format of a CIGAR string) that Salmon uses in alignment mode, but not any information, I think, that Salmon uses in quasi-mapping-based mode (though one would incur a non-trivial performance hit for filtering the quasi-mappings through file / disk rather than dealing with them directly in memory as Salmon normally does). > With UMI's you can deduplicate fragments before inferring where they were likely to come from. Ideally you would deduplicate the reads directly based on UMI, then you wouldn't have to think about PCR duplication in the quantification. But of course keeping a hash of all reads in a FASTQ and accounting for dequencing errors wouldn't be really tractable.. I guess this is the real question I have. Specifically, what is the true computational burden to detect and eliminate duplicates using UMIs? In theory, the reads must (1) map to the same location and (2) have the same UMI tag. How often would one expect the UMI tag to be modified / corrupted / etc.? Would you have to search all 1 or 2 hamming distance neighbors to detect duplicates reliably? Is an equivalence class a sufficient proxy for ""mapping to the same location"", or do we also care that e.g. the position of the fragment within each transcript is a duplicate as well?

As you can see there is quite a bit difference between two methods. Results from quasi mapping method look much similar to kallisto results. On the other hand, SAF method gave different results with lower mapping rates. My question is should one always trust the results from SAF method for downstream analysis since it supposed to give much accurate results? Is it usually normal to see this much differences between two methods (according to your [preprint](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/657874) their correlation rate seems to be very high)? Might this lower mapping rate seen with SAF method be due to the discarded fragments that are mapped to decoys? Can it be said that SAF method doing better job dealing with rRNA contamination and therefore yields more accurate results but with lower mapping rates in my case?.

Availability,"@ECuris --- For single-end reads the prior *is* the posterior. It is only possible to reliably estimate fragment lengths when one has paired-end reads, since with single-end reads one only has a single mapping fragment end, and hence cannot estimate the implied fragment size. So, with paired-end reads, the prior values are largely unimportant (the data overwhelm them quickly), but with single-end reads, having a reasonable estimate of the fragment length mean and standard deviation is important, because the effective lengths of the transcripts will be derived from these values.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/127#issuecomment-285693301:86,reliab,reliably,86,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/127#issuecomment-285693301,1,['reliab'],['reliably']
Availability,"@Gaura that definitely seems promising! A few questions:. -Is quantification via alevin-fry (rather than alevin itself) mandatory here? I ask since your run seems successful whereas my full alevin run had a very poor BC detection and mapping rate. -I see you specified `-l A` - can you comment on what the detected/correct library type was here?. -I assume all of this will also work in conjunction with `--expectCells` or `--keepCBFraction` if those parameters were needed? Your ~7k cells detected is very close to the published number _post-filtering_, but no similar filtering has been done here yet. My guess is that the proportion of cells that pass these filters will be higher for alevin, but we may still be under-estimating the number of real cells by a little bit here. . -Is there any prospect of dealing with frameshift errors in the barcode detection step?

I believe the issue you're seeing is that Ensembl will update transcript (and gene I think) versions like so:. ```; !! this is not real data, just a toy example. ensembl v24; -------------; ENST0000001.1; ENST0000002.1. ensembl v25; -------------; ENST0000001.2; ENST0000002.2; ```; and the GTF file you used to build the salmon index is ""ensembl v24"", but now you only have ""ensembl v25"" available during the `salmon quant` run. . **The most correct thing** to do at this point would be to either rebuild the salmon index using ""ensembl v25"" and rerun `salmon quant -g ensembl_v25.gtf`, or get the ""ensembl v24"" GTF file (re-download from Ensembl website) and pass this to `salmon quant -g ensembl_v24.gtf`. . **The thing would probably be okay** is to allow passing GTF files that do not exactly match the transcript accessions, where ""ENST0000001"" is the ""accession"" and "".1"" is the ""version"" - hence ""accession.version"".

Availability,"@k3yavi @rob-p Thanks for work pertaining to new Salmon indexing methods as mentioned in this preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v2. Some questions on salmon index building with salmon/v1.0 (as I am confused following the documentation at https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html) - let me know if my understanding is correct. 1. Is this how to create SAF indices - https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2019/selective-alignment/ - with these steps, I assume I do not have to separately download mashmap and bedtools software. 2. If one has to use SA method, does one still use the generateDecoyTranscriptome.sh method as listed here - https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/blob/master/scripts/generateDecoyTranscriptome.sh (and this requires the gff file, mashmap and bedtools software). 3. SA and SAF both require genome. Can I still use `salmon index` on the transcriptome file without using genome files? Based on the release notes quoted (copy/pasted) below, I am worried about the phrase `""mapping without selective alignment is disabled""`). . Salmon v1.0 release notes state: . > changes since v.014.1; > In this release of salmon, selective-alignment is enabled by default (and, in fact, mapping without selective-alignemnt is disabled). We may explore, in the future, ways to allow disabling selecive-alignment under the new mapping approach, but at this point, it is always enabled.; > ; ; 4. Page 18 of your preprint pdf states that you used ""salmon v0.15.0 for quasi-mapping"" - so I am assuming I have to keep 2 versions of salmon in my system if I have to do both quasi-mapping and SA/SAF?. 5. Page 19 of your preprint pdf states you used `--mimicBT2 and --useEM for SA and SAF` quantification methods. Is this the recommendation while using SA and SAF methods? ; From salmon v01.4.1 with SA method, I have all along used the default `VBEM `and `--validateMappings` based on info in [SalmonReadTheDocs](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/442:527,down,download,527,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/442,1,['down'],['download']

Specifically, alevin is looking to map the transcript `PB.40054.21` to a gene, but it is not finding that transcript in the file `PacBio/single_cell_pipeline/sqanti3_output/Alin_neg_txp2gene.tsv`. The question is a bit trickier when you have your own long-read derived transcriptome, since I don't know the process by which you are grouping transcripts into genes. It is always possible to have a transcript be its own gene (by having it appear in both the first and second columns in the same line of this file) — however, then you will lose information about how this transcript and other transcripts belonging to the same gene are related, which plays into how alevin quantifies gene-level abundance.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/540#issuecomment-648204069:35,error,error,35,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/540#issuecomment-648204069,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"@rob-p thanks for tagging me. I missed the primary discussion and went over it. ; @reganhayward , thanks for posting this interesting phenomenon. Checking for ambiguity is data driven, there are many sources of ambiguity, ; 1. Exon sharing (when both the transcripts share a splicing even and thereby share an exon.) ; 2. They originate from genes that ae paralogs of each other. ; 3. They share sequence of read length without an obvious clue (might stem some evolutionary event in the past.). Looking into the ensemble database `ENST00000374675.7` originates from [ENSG00000112473](https://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?g=ENSG00000112473;r=6:33168222-33172216) and `ENST00000428189.5` belongs to [ENSG00000229470.5](https://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Location/View?db=core;g=ENSG00000229470;r=HSCHR6_MHC_DBB:30499388-30515186). The second one comes from an alternate assembly according to ensemble from the same chromosome 6. There is a possibility that there is exon sharing. But I can not be sure before doing a blast etc. . There is a way from salmon to track this down. If you use `-d` option for dumping equivalence classes then, we can check for equivalence classes where these transcripts occur. If they co-occure in an equivalence class then we could be sure that it is due to read sharing. If you can provide me the equivalence class file (should be a smaller one), I can look into it. The gibbs/bootstraps would come handy once we know the equivalence classes, since it will reveal how the uncertain the estimates are for these two transcripts when compared to their equivalence class members. .

It's fairly standard practice for us to put information that is meant to be read by both humans and machines (scripts, R packages downstream, etc.) into a JSON file. This makes it easy to access it simply from many languages, and to have _some_ (but not too much) structure to this data. There are even slick command line tools for pulling info out of JSON files (like [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)). If there is a strong reason that you need the _salmon_ version in its own text file, I'm willing to oblige and duplicate the information there. Just let me know.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/498#issuecomment-605694474:612,down,downstream,612,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/498#issuecomment-605694474,2,['down'],['downstream']

Availability,"A bit delayed, but this relates to the questions I've been asking on the salmon gitter. . First, it's worth pointing out that the new 10x (v2) sequencing is a lot more like other bead methods, where (i) index reads (i7/i5) are for labelling biological samples (ii) read1 contains the combined cell and molecular/UMI barcodes (ii) read2 is the transcript 3' read. So it seems there is now some data format convergence. Either way, I'd guess that ongoing iterations of the high throughput platforms will keep one read for the transcript 3', reserving the other 2 or 3 reads for some combination of the sample, cell and molecular barcodes. . Before thinking about how to best collapse UMIs, there's also the issue of how best to QC the barcodes and beads. Jim Namesh has [some functions](http://mccarrolllab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Drop-seqAlignmentCookbookv1.2Jan2016.pdf); as does [Vasilis Ntranos](https://github.com/pachterlab/scRNA-Seq-TCC-prep/blob/master/README.md). Arguably this has nothing to do with salmon/kallisto though I think the kallisto guys were smart to include it. It's a good filter even if only for speeding things up. Then it's really what might be the most appropriate demultiplexing of fastqs to allow compatibility between tecnhiques, I guess. I quite like how the kallisto workflow ends up with a fastq per cell together with a matching UMI file. Then at the very least one can ignore the UMIs (perhaps going with what @vals suggests). Not sure if that's helpful. But thought to chime in as somebody we would love to see salmon working on the high throughput single-cell platforms that have sample, cell and molecular barcodes. Even if only to test how worthwhile UMIs genuinely are for most applications. This may be a controversial comment, but I suspect for me UMIs will largely end up the same way as spike-ins: useful for quantifying endogenous RNA recovered per cell but perhaps not all that useful beyond that for low read depth single-cell signature profiling.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/93#issuecomment-265619589:1912,recover,recovered,1912,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/93#issuecomment-265619589,1,['recover'],['recovered']
Availability,"A clear and concise description of what the bug is. I have previously followed the steps outlined in the alevin-fry tutorial for a single sample and everything worked as expected. Now I am following the same steps but wrapped in a snakemake pipeline to process several samples and am running into issues building the index. Specifically, I am receiving the following error when my pipeline moves on the mapping reads step:. ```; Exception : [Error: The index version file /beevol/home/winklerc/projects/scifi_pipeline/scifi/ref/idx/complete_ref_lens.bin/versionInfo.json doesn't seem to exist. Please try re-building the salmon index.]; alevin (sc-align) was invoked improperly.; ```. I have tried re-building the index, and have also tried reusing the index that I had previously built for the single sample run that previously worked. However, neither of those approaches fixed the above error. When I build the index I am able to generate all of the expected files and the file sizes match those of my previous (successful) index build, so I am not sure why I am getting an error that the `versionInfo.json` file is missing. **To Reproduce**; Steps and data to reproduce the behavior:. I followed the alevin-fry tutorial to generate a splici transcriptome, using the same [Human reference (GRCh38) dataset](https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A.tar.gz) provided by the tutorial.

This file needs to exactly match the transcript IDs used when building the initial salmon index, furthermore, when building the initial index, a gtf file containing the transcript to gene mappings is typically provided. In order to ensure ideal mappings of transcripts to genes, it would be ideal if, when constructing the salmon index when a GTF file is provided, an additional tgMap file was automatically produced from the GTF and written to the index output directory that could then be automatically detected by alevin, and/or then manually passed to other downstream tools.

Availability,"Dear @callumparr,. Thank you for bringing this up. So you are correct that the `--noLengthCorrection` flag should be passed to salmon when quantifying data that does not have a ""fragmentation effect"", that is, where the number of fragments we expect to draw from a transcript is not dependent upon the length of that transcript. In the ONT protocols, it is usually the case that we get 1 read -> 1 transcript, even if we don't read the whole thing. We have tested the effect of this in ONT data with spike ins, and have verified that using `--noLengthCorrection` does generally lead to improved accuracy with respect to quantification estimates. We have informed ONT of this, and I would guess they may optimize the flags that are used soon (we have also developed an error model that works correctly for these long reads, and that should make it into the next release of salmon). Regarding the effect this has on the `NumReads` values reported by salmon, it's not as simple as with the `TPM` estimates. The length affects the assigned reads through the probabilistic model on which inference is done. With the length effect we have that P(f | t_i) ∝ P( position | f, t_i ) * P( alignment | f, t_i) --- forgetting the alignment term for the time being, we have that with length correction P( position | f, t_i ) ∝ 1 / l_i and without length correction the l_i term goes away. In other words, the probability of allocating reads has a term that depends on the effective length when the `--noLengthCorrection` flag is not passed, but that term goes away when it is passed. This is not quite as drastic as with TPM where the normalization includes the length directly in the normalization (note, however, that when the `--noLengthCorrection` flag is passed, this adjusts the TPM as well). Further, the `NumReads` is still better than TPM in this regard because it still encodes the effect size (i.e. `NumReads` will sum to the total number of aligned reads). Anyway TLDR: Passing the `--noLengthCorrectio",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/651#issuecomment-821995147:768,error,error,768,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/651#issuecomment-821995147,2,['error'],['error']

Availability,"Dear `salmon` developers,. We are using salmon at ONT for quantifying transcripts from alignments of cDNA reads to transcriptomes on a regular basis and in [some](https://github.com/nanoporetech/pipeline-transcriptome-de) of our pipelines.; Transcriptomic aligments of long reads generate less multimapping reads than short reads (depeneding on the structure of the transcriptome), however we would prefer not to ignore them during quantification in order to make maximal use of the data.; However, since the error model was built for short reads, until now we have used the tool with the error model turned off (`--noErrorModel`), which is not optimal. Would it be possible to add a simple error model suitable for long read alignments? We propose something like the following for calculating the likelihood of an alignment:. - The likelihood of the aligment would be calculated based on the empirical distributions (or a normal fit) of edit distances conditioned on the length of the alignment. We could provide you with this information if needed.; - The likelihood of left and right soft or hard clipped sequences would be calculated as a function of their length (such as (1/x)^z, where the parameter z can be tuned based on real datasets). A more complicated model could be build taking into account the error profile of the long reads. It might be overkill though. I had a look at the source code and it seems to me that it might not be hard to implement it, however I am lacking the intimate knowledge of the codebase to do it easily.; Let me know if you would be interested in adding this feature.

Curiously, salmon could still accomplish the whole procedure and generate the results file with the aformentioned error reported. But I' m worried about its reliability in this situation.

Availability,"Dear salmon team and @k3yavi,. I am an happy user of alevin on scRNAseq data (10x). In some circumstances, I have to compare samples from very uneven sequencing depth (less than 100k reads per cell vs 1M reads per cell,), which naturally produces a huge ""batch effect"", some transcripts being impossible to detect at a lower sequencing depth. For 10x datasets, cellranger offers to compensate this kind of difference across datasets by subsampling, and I should tell it works very well. I tried this strategy before running alevin, by the use of python scripts subsampling the fastq files prior any alevin quasi-mapping. However, all my attempts failed, as all downstream analyses shown that this strategy didn't correct the batch effect at all with alevin (visualization on dimension reduction/UMAP show a huge difference between batches, while the cellranger subsampling method clearly corrects it). An important point is by default, the cellranger method corrects according to the amount of mapped reads between samples. So ideally, I should have to evaluate the difference in term of mapped reads to compute a subsampling coefficient (fraction of reads to keep). What correct alevin metrics should I use to estimate such a coefficient?. Considering the probalistic approach of alevin's transcript quantification, I am wondering if it could be any better way to normalize the samples to account for this kind of issue? Also, any option to subsample the reads (take a read into account under a certain probability) during alevin quantification would be of great help in my case.

Availability,"Due to a current default in the boost library (https://github.com/boostorg/math/issues/1211) in boost::math::digamma, there is a performance hit on aarch64. This happens on v1.10.3 of Salmon, with GNU compiler 13 on Linux aarch64. A 4-thread quantization of one of the Salmon tutorials DRR0* series files spends ~15% of time in this routine (called within CollapsedEMOptimizer). On a larger example, we see 7% performance hit over a run that takes 1300 seconds on 4 cores. On x86 this time is small enough to be lost in the noise. `salmon quant -i athal_index -l A ; -1 DRR016125/DRR016125_1.fastq.gz; -2 DRR016125/DRR016125_2.fastq.gz ; -p $threads --validateMappings -o quants/DRR016125_quant`. There is a simple fix which is to ensure the CMake/Makefiles ensure salmon compiles with: ; `-DBOOST_MATH_NO_LONG_DOUBLE_MATH_FUNCTIONS`; or to add that to any file that brings in boost::math via adding `#define BOOST_MATH_NO_LONG_DOUBLE_MATH_FUNCTIONS` at the start. With that change, a 1300 second runtime drops to 1212 for the larger test case, and for the tutorial case is 48 seconds down to 40 on a 4-core r8g.xlarge (Graviton4). Whilst Boost may fix the issue soon - it's likely that older versions of the library will be found installed for some time.

The cmake system still forces downloading pufferfish during configure, which is forbidden in the ports system (like many other package managers). All downloads must occur during fetch phase and be verified using locally stored checksums. This would be easy to work around using GH_TUPLE, which downloads additional distfiles during fetch phase, except that fetchPufferfish.sh doesn't just extract the pufferfish dist, but has a long list of ""cp"" commands to copy pieces of it to ${INSTALL_DIR}. That's not something I'm inclined to tamper with since it will likely change with new versions and hence be a headache to maintain over time.

See the image below:. ![Alignments](https://www.ialbert.me/static/down/pseudo_alignments/pseudo_aln.png). (Top Kallisto, second Salmon, bottom Hisat. ). The soft clipped sequences are not marked as such, therefore lead to ugly misalignment at the ends, that in turn dominate the visualization. .

Availability,"Got it, thanks for the heads up. I'd probably reach out to the refgenie people about the hg38 specific versions. It makes sense to have the feature of having the gtf at the time of indexing. The only concern I have is that mandating to have the gtf might restrict the overall workflow by a bit. Specifically because a user might not always have the full GTF available for every use case, although we can always make having GTF as an optional requirement for indexing. Adding the support should not be too difficult but it will certainly add a new logic path which would need thorough testing. . We'll certainly keep you updated with the feature as we progress although it can take some time to get back. In terms of your pipeline one option would be to actually save the GTF explicitly in the salmon index folder post indexing.

(after removing `-1` from the CB names). ; `[alevinLog] [error] Barcode not found in frequency table`: This error means some of the CB given externally through the whitelist command seems to have no reads at all which violates the above assumption, you can potentially skip this error by using `--debug` flag with alevin (only if have version v0.11.3) but this mode has is yet to be extensively tested.; In case where you don't externally give whitelist CB, Alevin uses knee and KDE based method to identify the cutoff on the knee (and later correct for it) of the CB distribution.

Availability,"Happy to compare notes! For benchmarking accuracy I'm mostly using data from SEQC. There are four reference samples, each sequenced quite deeply at several different labs. I took 20 lanes from BGI, which is about 100 million reads, which I compare it to TaqMan (~800 genes), PrimePCR on (~18000 genes), and ERCC spike-ins. . On top of that, to get more directly at isoform-level accuracy, I'm simulating data using rlsim, which I've found to be the least awful RNA-Seq simulator. Unlike most simulators, it models some technical effects/bias. I think it underestimates these, but still a lot better than most that assume perfect uniform random sampling, etc. I also have a set of benchmarks designed to get at the question of consistency or stability of estimates, which is one of the main thrusts of the paper I'm working on. The other aspect I've been fretting about a lot the last month has been just what metric to use. You should check out this paper if you haven't seen it, which is pretty eye-opening as to the problems with using correlation on compositional gene expression data. > Lovell, D., Pawlowsky-Glahn, V., Egozcue, J. J., Marguerat, S., & Bähler, J. (2015). Proportionality: a valid alternative to correlation for relative data. PLoS Computational Biology, 11(3), e1004075. http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075. Those problems aren't unique to correlation. E.g. the ""median relative difference"" approach taken by the Kallisto paper is very much affected by this, I think even more so than correlation. The method I've adopted is to use the ""proportionality correlation"" they propose on page 9, and add 0.1 TPM to expression values to account for zeros and tiny values. It's not terribly sensitive to the additive constant and gives pretty reliable results in my experience.

Availability,"Hello! I did some work with the oxford nanopore error model last summer. There's a blog post about the ONT long read quantification here: https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon-tutorials/2021/ont-long-read-quantification/ . In terms of length correction, the --ont flag basically turns off length correction (since it doesn't really apply to long reads). The error model that the current version of salmon uses for the --ont flag (found in src/ONTAlignmentModel.cpp) basically bins reads by length (into 4 bins by default, I believe). Then for each bin it learns a binomial/geometric distribution for the number of errors (mismatches or indels) in the alignment of the reads in the bin, as well as distributions for the number of bases softclipped at the beginning and end of the read. It then uses these models to penalize reads that have an amount of errors/softclips that is very different from the center of the learned distribution, only if the number of errors/softclips is larger than what we expect for that bin (since a smaller than expected number of errors in the alignment is generally a good, not a bad sign for how likely the read is to map to this transcript).

Availability,"Hello!; This might be an unusual request, but I have been attempting to use Salmon Alevin for mapping of **scATAC-seq data** (10X Genomics platform) and have a few questions on how to best do this (/whether it is possible at all!). _**A bit of background**_:; I have two sequenced libraries of the same cross-species hybrid: scRNA-seq 10X v3 and scATAC-seq 10X (alas, not from the same cells). My aim is to use Salmon Alevin on both, using a home-made diploid reference so that down the line I can do allele-specific analysis on both datasets and then compare allelic imbalance. _**What I have done**_:; I generated a diploid reference ""feature set"" for the scATAC-seq, to mimic in a way how the reference transcriptome is interpreted. I did this by using bulk ATAC data from both species, calling peaks with MACS2, and then using this peak set (BED format) to extract strain- and species-corrected sequences (fasta) to use as a reference. _**My questions/issues**_:; Considering the basic Alevin invocation:; `salmon alevin -l ISR -1 cb.fastq.gz -2 reads.fastq.gz --chromiumV3 -i salmon_index_directory [--whitelist barcodes.tsv] -p 10 -o alevin_output`; ; `-1 cb.fastq.gz` —> these should be CB+UMI reads, but in 10X ATAC there are no UMIs, so this would only be a 16bp CB. I'm afraid this would be a major issue considering how Alevin relies on UMI whitelisting. Would it help if I already provide a list of filtered whitelisted CB, as provided by Cell Ranger? I have this from a quality control alignment to only one parental species. `--chromiumV3 `—> If I understand correctly, this tells the program to search for the first X bases of cb.fastq.gz as CB, and the first Y bases of it as UMI (as per [this ](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/369) thread). So technically one could swap --chromiumV3 for --end 5 --barcodeLength X --umiLength Y and set this manually?

Availability,"Hello, I am relatively new to bioinformatics/salmon. I am using the newest version of salmon (v1.10.0, downloaded executable). I created two decoy-aware transcriptomes using 1. a Trinity assembly created with 24 RNA-seq samples plus a published genome of the same species (an insect) and 2. a transcriptome compiled using Evigene into which I fed the same Trinity assembly, a MEGAHIT assembly (created with the same read files), and a previously published transcriptome from the same species, along with the same published genome of the same species as above. Running salmon with the two different indexes yields very different results using the same set of paired-end RNA-seq files. With the Trinity assembly-only-index, I get ""expected_format"": ""IU""; whereas with the Evigene index, I get ""expected_format"": ""ISR"". Why would this differ when the read files are exactly the same? Isn't the read file what is being looked at to automatically detect the library type? . For the Trinity index, here is an example from one sample:; ""strand_mapping_bias"": 0.5196075475175259; ; The same sample run with the Evigene index gave:; ""strand_mapping_bias"": 0.00013477965729161834. . For every sample run with the Trinity index, a warning ""Detected a *potential* strand bias > 1% in an unstranded protocol"" appeared, whereas this was very rare for samples run with the Evigene index, even though when using the latter, the strand-mapping_bias was FAR farther from the 0.50 ideal (it was always < 0.01). Why is this the case? I expected similar results using both indexes, because the read files used to create the two transcriptomes were largely the same, and both used Trinity as part (or all) of the transcriptome assembly process. .

Availability,"Hello, I'm interested in trying out Salmon for the first time. In this analysis, I would like to disentangle a host eukaryote organism's reads for quantification from read data containing it and eight of its microbial symbionts. The host (C. elegans worms) of course has a great genome and transcriptome available.` transcript.fa` is no problem.; The microbes all have genomes and gtfs, but not transcript files (on NCBI). Luckily, I'm not interested in quantifying them - I checked a couple samples with STAR and BBsplit (within the BBmap toolkit) and microbial read abundance is too low for any one bacterium to use in analysis. However, I still need to get those bacteria reads out of the picture when quantifying the host worm reads/transcripts. **What is the best approach to go from a mixed-organism read pool to quantified host transcripts?**. - Perhaps, target-transcriptome = worm_transcripts.fa, with a concatenated decoy composed of worm transcripts, worm genome, and the genomes of the 8 microbes? This seems like the fastest and least error prone method, based on my developing understanding of Salmon. - Or, truly align reads and bin them to new fastq files using genomes+gtfs with STAR/samtools (or just genomes with BBsplit).

However, when I run all the genes together (Genes A-E), the results from Gene C and Gene D are drastically different, but this is only under certain parameters (red highlight).

Availability,"Hello,. I am using the recent downloaded executable for v1.1.0 and am using salmon (bulk-mode). Noticed one potential bug and have some general questions regarding bootstraps. 1. The potential bug I noticed was when I use `--numGibbsSamples` the logs/salmon_quant.log file is always blank. When I remove this flag and re-run the program the log file is correctly printed out. 2. Regarding Bootstraps:. I've been working with parameters to min/max my predicted estimates to quantified cDNA results that we have. Through this process I was not performing bootstraps and was just using the TPM results that were located within the `quants.sf` file and have been getting some good results, with R-squared values of ~0.98 for actual v. predicted plots. As a note, even after running hundreds of runs with the same parameters, the TPM values in the `quants.sf` file never really fluctuated that much between runs and were generally nearly identical. . However, I thought it would be best to bootstrap `--numBootstraps` each Salmon run and average the bootstraps to get more accurate results. After doing 1,000 bootstraps per sample I noticed that the TPM values I calculated from numbers of mapped reads in the `bootstraps.gz` fluctuated a lot more and overall brought my R-squared values down to ~0.87. (I used your ConvertBootstrapsToTSV.py script to get the read counts from the bootstrap file and then calculated the TPMs using the effective lengths from the `quants.sf` file. As looking through previous issues (#246) I was under the assumption that the bootstrap file only contained new mapped read estimates and the effective lengths should be the same for all bootstrap runs.) . My question is why do the TPM values in the `quants.sf` file not fluctuate as much (even after 100+ runs using the same parameters), while calculated TPM values from bootstraps of the same run are showing greater variance?",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/466:30,down,downloaded,30,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/466,2,['down'],"['down', 'downloaded']"

Availability,"Hello,. I've actually been thinking of a different method that would require very stringent mapping. By providing transcripts of only exon 1 & 2, exon 2 & 3, and exon 1 & 3 I could get a better idea of the number of reads that skip exon 2 all together. Also, by averaging the read counts that map to the junctions of exon 1 & 2 and exon 2 & 3, I can help eliminate polyA tail bias that is heavily positioned towards exon 1 and would also allow me to get a more accurate prediction of the two gene versions since 1 read mapped to exon 1 & 2 and 1 read mapped to exon 2 & 3 would essentially tell me twice that the gene is there while a read mapped to exon 1 & 3 would only tell me once that the gene is there. However, doing so would force me to bring ```AuxSampleNumber``` down to very low numbers such as 10 - 100 as using stringent coverage parameters drastically reduces my reads mapped. . I do wonder though how these low AUX numbers might affect your model development and algorithm.

Avi and I have chatted a bit about this offline, and [I've commented about this in the past](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/discussions/629#discussioncomment-777414), but I'm currently attempting to extend alevin's use to the newer combinatorial indexing experiments like [SPLiT-seq](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/176) or the commercial solution, [ParseBio](https://www.parsebiosciences.com/) (the biotech formerly known as SplitBio). Now that you support different barcode geometries and allow the user to specify where these barcodes should be expected, this _should_ be doable. . I've downloaded the [raw data from the original SPLiT-seq paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM3017261), and we have some ParseBio data of our own; my goal is to help you all write a vignette on this once we get the details worked out. . In short, the R1 file contains cDNA sequence, and R2 contains a 10bp UMI followed by 3 different barcodes in the following arrangements (note: ParseBio seems to shift BC1 up a few bp, to 79-86):; - UMI: 1-10; - BC3: 11-18; - BC2: 49-56; - BC1: 87-94. The intervening bases are a combination of common and variable sequences. The other wrinkle with these approaches is that the cDNA can be amplified using either oligo-dT or random hexamer barcodes. The net effect of this is that BC1 can be one of two options, and some barcode combinations need to be pooled to represent the same cell. For example:. AACGTGAT-CTGTAGCC-ACACAGAA; GATAGACA-CTGTAGCC-ACACAGAA. may be the same cell, amplified by two different means. . We know how the BC1s are paired, so Avi suggested pre-processing the R2 FASTQ file such that we locate random hexamer BC1 sequences and modify them to the matched oligo-dT sequence. In the above example, we'd correct some R2 reads that contain ""GATAGACA"" in the 87-94 position to ""AACGTGAT"".

Availability,"Hey Rob,. I did manage to test v1.3 this evening. Ran much faster. The same sample that took about 6 hours ran in 45mins.

Hi ; @shalercr,; I agree that if each sample runs as quickly as you see here, it's not a big deal to just re-run them all. Note that, while my avoids ~116 times more (eventually-discarded) alignments than did yours, the difference in the number of discarded; fragments (i.e. fragments that had no mapping) is very small — ~7,000, or 0.023% of the fragments. Thus, despite the huge speed-up, I wouldn't expect many differences in the quantifications. However, I couldn't argue against re-quantifying everything; with the new version just for good measure :). When you have a chance, please do let me know if you see this same performance difference using the pre-compiled (linux) binary. here.

Availability,"Hi @Beatzekatze,. The issue with test 1 seems to be from CMake being unable to find the unit test to execute under certain configurations. I'll consider this a bug in the CMake file, and look into fixing it. The failure of tests 2 and 3 is more interesting, as one would definitely not expect this given that the program compiled without error. Does indexing fail only with `--type fmd`, or also with `--type quasi` (or no `--type` as that is the default)? Would it be possible to run the command under gdb and report the stack trace? That would be something like:. ```; $ gdb --args salmon index -t transcripts.fasta -i sample_salmon_fmd_index --type fmd; ```. and then, when you encounter the segfault issuing the back-trace `bt` command. This would give insight into where, exactly this is showing up. One issue I've seen before is when the resident installation of Boost is _not_ compiled with `--std=c++11` (or 14 or 17), since this leads to an incompatible ABI between salmon and the Boost library. If that's what's going on, it should be evident from the backtrace.

Availability,"Hi @Davidwei7,. Thank you for the very detailed bug report! So, I have two initial responses / thoughts about your issue. First, you asked if the issue may be related to a memory allocation error wherein the index didn't build successfully. This is quite possible (and the error you see during quantification is consistent with that). The *full* decoy index is substantially larger than the index on just the transcriptome (after all, it is indexing the entire human genome in addition to the transcriptome). One thing you might try to test this hypothesis, other than requesting to build on a node with more RAM, is to compute a hash (e.g. md5 or sha256 sum) on all of the files in the index, and also record their sizes. Then we can build the index on the same version of the files on our end and compare. Second — and perhaps more importantly for your end goal — the main purpose of the decoy-aware index is to improve specificity rather than sensitivity. That is, the decoys are designed to help avoid _spurious_ mapping of reads to an annotated transcript when a better explanation for the read exists elsewhere in the genome. However, the reads that are mapped to decoys are not otherwise used for quantification. Thus, using the decoy aware transcriptome index is unlikely to improve your mapping rate. I agree that your mapping rate does seem rather low. There are a few potential culprits here, and some diagnostics we can look at to see what might be going wrong. First, you can take a look at the file `aux_info/meta_info.json` in the salmon quantification directories to get a few more details about why reads were not mapped. If you share one of those files here I can describe the relevant fields. Also, I have two more rather common things to consider that might affect the mapping rate. One is to add the sequence for the ribosomal RNAs to your transcriptome before indexing and then quantifying. If your mapping rate increases considerably, this is evidence of rather inefficient depl",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/603#issuecomment-744162850:190,error,error,190,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/603#issuecomment-744162850,2,['error'],['error']

""Since v3.0 of the pipeline, featureCounts is no longer used to perform gene/transcript quantification, however it is still used to generate QC metrics based on [biotype](http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/biotypes.html) information available within GFF/GTF genome annotation files. This decision was made primarily because of the limitations of featureCounts to appropriately quantify gene expression data. Please see [Zhao et al., 2015](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141910#pone-0141910-t001) and [Soneson et al., 2015](https://f1000research.com/articles/4-1521/v1)."". This is a common cause of confusion and I have tried to be as explicit about this in the docs. featureCounts is used to quantify features in the annotation by `gene_biotype` and not the actual gene / transcript features themselves. This may explain why you are seeing these discrepancies. However, I am still a little puzzled how you are able to directly compare the counts generated by featureCounts and Salmon (in either mode) because the core features that are being quantified should be different. Where did you get the plant reference genome from? If it's not from Ensembl then it probably isn't worth running the biotype quantification with featureCounts anyway because the GTF annotation files may not contain that information. There are some docs for this [here](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.8.1/usage#prokaryotic-genome-annotations).

Currently, Alevin merge all the observed CB which are 1-edit distance from a known whitelist CB towards the whitelist. The underlying assumption being that the sequencing error (although with low probability) can change CB sequence and we can correct for that. I wonder, is this right to do for your experiment ?. re: >Is there an option for max distance allowed between BC or UMI?; Sorry, but I don't completely understand this question. When you say distance allowed between CB and UMI, do you mean there is a sequence between CB and UMI ( like in in-drop seq)? If that's the case then we might have to tweak a bit in alevin command line flags again. But I suspect what you meant by above statement is -- max distance allowed between CB among themselves. If that's the question then unfortunately we currently allow correcting for only 1-edit distance for both CB and UMI.

Luckily, the solution is simple; just don't use whole program inter procedural optimization.

Availability,"Hi @Kisekya,. So BWA-MEM and BWA-MEM2 are somewhat of a problem to begin with because they perform local alignment, which isn't really ideal for aligning RNA-seq reads to the transcriptome. If you really wish to use an aligner, we've had good experiences with Bowtie2 (when used in the appropriate end-to-end alignment mode) and with STAR (using the alignments projected to the transcriptome with `--quantMode TranscriptomeSAM` flag to output the alignments in transcriptomic coordinates as required by salmon). Apart from the local alignment issue, sorting the BAM file is _absolutely_ a problem for salmon, and is likely why you get the strange library type. When run in alignment mode, just like RSEM, salmon requires the alignments for the the mates of a read pair to appear subsequently in the file, and for all alignments for a given read to appear contiguously in the file. This allows parsing the reads without having to require potentially unbounded memory (holding the record for one end of a fragment in memory while waiting for the record for the other end). In fact, given that you've sorted the alignments here, I'm surprised you're not getting the ""suspicious pair"" warnings in your logs. The ISR library with 40% mapping is likely a more reliable number. The obvious question here is why might the mapping rate be this low? There are a few reasons you might see something like this. One, for example, is poor ribosomal depletion, paired with not having all of the rRNA sequences in your index. In this case, you have many fewer reads coming from the rest of the transcriptome and you get depleted mapping rates like this. . Could you say a bit more about the experimental setup? Is this in a well-annotated organism like human / mouse etc.? Is this a polyA selection or ribosomal depletion prep? Anything else that might be relevant to sample quality?.

Indeed, the _default_ behavior of salmon is to de-duplicate transcripts (to avoid that behavior and allow salmon to index duplicate transcripts, you need to pass the `--keepDuplicates` flag to the indexer).

Currently Alevin relies on the fact that the droplet based protocols use PCR amplification of the library and the UMI deduplication phase of Alevin assumes an exponential model, I am not sure how true is this with CEL-seq?

Availability,"Hi @ShenTTT,. First, thank you for the detailed analysis (and for doing the work of looking up this issue in past posts). If the (trimmed) reads are of high quality and there aren't signs of contamination, my initial hunch would be that there are a considerable number of reads coming from outside of the annotated transcriptome (that is, I would suspect `2` to be the most likely culprit here). I don't think this is because of DNA `contamination` necessarily, but rather because of novel transcripts that don't appear in your annotation. Obviously, salmon can only quantify what it knows about in terms of annotated transcripts. If you are concerned about these mapping rates, one thing you might try is to do transcript assembly in these samples (using e.g. scallop or StringTie2) and then re-quantify using salmon under the expanded annotation. Also, while you are losing ~5M reads to low mapping scores (suggesting they are not a good match for the underlying annotated transcripts), this doesn't seem to be what is driving your overall mapping rate (i.e. this is only ~15% of fragments, so the rest of the difference between 85% and 56% comes from reads that don't fall into this category). Finally, while you may be able to ""recover"" more reads by lowering the mapping threshold `--minScoreFraction` from its default value of 0.65, that default is actually pretty liberal (especially for trimmed reads). So this would be letting in quite low-quality alignments. Note that, if you have unannotated isoforms that share sequence (exons) with annotated isoforms, this could partly describe what you are seeing with some of these reads, where part of the read aligns but part does not (because it comes from an unannotated splice form).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/533#issuecomment-638929976:1232,recover,recover,1232,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/533#issuecomment-638929976,1,['recover'],['recover']
Availability,"Hi @Tima-Ze,. This should not cause any trouble with downstream analysis. The indexing procedure is simply informing you that these transcripts (about which you are being warned) are shorter than the seed length used for alignment. This means that it simply won't be possible for fragments to align to these transcripts, and so they will always have a 0 abundance in the resulting `quant.sf` files. This isn't a problem, as these transcripts are too short to be measured via RNA-seq anyway. The indexing messages just let you know this in advance. You can safely ignore these warnings for your downstream analysis.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/214#issuecomment-751366278:53,down,downstream,53,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/214#issuecomment-751366278,4,['down'],['downstream']
Availability,"Hi @Tima-Ze,. Yes, salmon can be used to quantify these reads, but the results will depend (somewhat) on the `--fldMean` and `--fldSD` flags that are used. It's important to note that this is not a unique characteristic of salmon, and any transcript-level quantification tool using a probabilistic model (e.g. RSEM, eXpress, BitSeq, etc.) have the same requirement. That is, the fragment length distribution should be known so that _effective_ transcript lengths can be estimated, which have an effect on fragment assignment probabilities. If the wrong fragment length distribution is specified, then the _effective_ transcript lengths will be off and this can affect the assignment of some fragments. This is only a requirement with single-end reads, since with paired-end reads the fragment length distribution is learned from the data. Further, the inference procedure is somewhat robust to these choices (small changes in fld mean and sd don't generally lead to drastically different results). If you have access to the BioAnalyzer results for the sequencing run, those can give information about the fragment length distribution (even in a single end experiment). If not, you can proceed with the default values. Even if they don't exactly match the true distribution in the single-end sample, at least the same values will be applied in all samples and so, ideally, most results of misspecification will wash out in subsequent differential analysis. . Finally, it's worth noting that the same restriction holds in both alignment-based and mapping-based modes. This is because in neither mode do single-end fragments provide sufficient information to estimate the fragment length distribution from the data. We only know where one end of a fragment mapped and cannot infer where the other end would be. This is not an alignment versus mapping (versus selective-alignment) issue, but rather is fundamental to having only observed one side of the entire fragment generated during fragmentation and ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/127#issuecomment-750920243:884,robust,robust,884,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/127#issuecomment-750920243,2,['robust'],['robust']

Availability,"Hi @bounlu,. Thank you for the detailed report. The mapping rate certainly does seem very low. To answer your specific questions first:; 1) I'm not sure --- let's try tor find out; 2) I don't think so (if they are part of your index, they should be aligned against); 3) If there are many transcripts / targets you expect to be sequenced but which aren't present in this set, that can affect the mapping rate, but not likely to take it down to 6%. Here are the things I'd investigate --- roughly in order: . 1) In addition to the fraction of reads STAR mapped (which you report above), what fraction of the reads are assigned to features by featureCounts? In some cases, when there is a failure of rRNA depletion of polyA selection, you can end up with an experiment where most of the sequenced RNA comes from rRNA not present in the reference transcriptome. In this case, STAR will be able to align the reads to the genome, but you won't see these reads mapping to annotated features (and you also won't see them showing up in your transcript level quantifications). So, it may be worth to take a look at the count of reads assigned to the feature set of genes by featureCounts. 2) Above, it looks like a considerable number of fragments were discarded due to no alignment reaching the required alignment score (`11,448,458` fragments discarded because of this). Have you tried to adapter / quality trim the data? Does this have any effect on the mapping rate?. 3) If the above don't reveal any clues, I'd be happy to try to take a look at the data if you can share it. I'd be quite surprised if STAR is aligning a lot of reads *to transcriptome features* that are being missed by salmon. Nonetheless, if you pass the proper flags to STAR (including `--quantMode TranscriptomeSAM`), then you can use the SAM/BAM file generated by STAR to perform quantification with salmon (i.e. use STAR's alignments to do _transcript-level_ quantification).

Availability,"Hi @bsipos,. This is caused primarily by salmon's desire to apply an error model (by default) to the CIGAR strings. For secondary alignments, as you note, minmap2 doesn't write the read string, and so when salmon is trying to score the alignments under the error model, it can't find the relevant characters in the read. In general, it's not clear to me if one would actually want to apply the error model (designed primarily for short reads) when quantifying long reads (this is something we are currently testing in the lab). For the time being, I'd probably recommend disabling the error model when quantifying alignments from long reads (`--noErrorModel`). In that case, the errors should hopefully go away.

Availability,"Hi @callumparr,. Thank you for the detailed report. I think this is primarily an error in documentation. The `gencode` flag is intended to be used only with ""mapping-based"" mode and when creating the index. It ensures that the index (and hence the resulting quantifications) contain the shortened names for gencode transcripts. In alignment-based mode, the behavior of the flag would have to be slightly different. It would have to re-normalize not only the names of the reference sequences in the fasta file, but it would also have to re-normalize the names in the BAM header so that they match. Specifically, the requirement is that the names of the sequences in the input fasta file are a 1-1 match with the names in the BAM header so that transcripts can be matched up properly with their sequences for training and applying the error model. However, if your BAM file already contains the stripped transcript names (i.e. if the BAM file header has the names without everything past the initial `|`), then I believe you can use the following command to have salmon do the same to the fasta file on the fly, so that the names match. ```{bash}; salmon-1.5.1_linux_x86_64/bin/salmon quant --ont -p 4 -t <(awk '{ if ($0 ~ ""^>"") { split($0,a,""|""); print a[1] } else { print $0 } }' Genome_files/gencode.vM24.transcripts.fa) -l U -a Documents/Day2_03_DRS_pass.bam -o Documents/counts/Day2_03_DRS_pass; ```. If the BAM file contains the ""full"" transcript name however, I think the current options are either to let salmon use the full transcript name from the fasta file, or to modify the GTF when running with minimap2, so that the BAM file itself contains the shortened names. Finally, I'd like to mention that the way you _intended_ to use the `--gencode` flag in alignment mode actually makes _a lot_ of sense, and I think it would be a very nice feature.

Availability,"Hi @danphillips28,. Oh ok! Now I see what's going on. We really should be more stringent about catching the issue here. . The problem is that using k > 32 is not permitted in the current implementation. This is because we use a 64-bit machine word to encode k-mers, and you can only fit up to 32 nucleotides in a word. In reality, anything > 31 is not allowed, since the k-mer should be odd so that the orientation can be inferred from the canonical (lexicographically smaller) version. There is nothing fundamentally problematic about using a larger k, it's just that it would require some modifications throughout the codebase we've not yet made. Further, we've not really found cases where having such large k really help. Specifically, the larger k, the fewer errors you need to render a read unmappable (if there is an error in every k-mer, you can't map the read). On the other hand, selective alignment will do a good job of filtering out poor matches where there is insufficient similarity between the read and reference. Thus, we set a default value of k=31. You can go lower (with any odd value), but it's not currently possible to go higher. I hope this clears things up, and thanks for bringing this to our attention.

Specially with the introduction of combinatorial barcoding of single cells, as you said, the information might be in multiple files and has to be extracted right.

Availability,"Hi @dritoshi ,. As per your request I've added the support for Quartz-seq2 data in the alevin framework with https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/commit/f6905b1d1dc6cf6bc4597927ad3be637ba615c9a and should be available with next salmon release.

Currently I just have on flag i.e. quartzseq2 which assumes 15 length CB and 8 length UMI. Unfortunately adding multiple versioned is gonna be little complicated as I might have to discuss with the alevin team and that might take some time. As you can check through the new code through the commit (linked above) adding just the Rule of new protocol is not enough and we might have to add some helper code with each new protocol which increases the redundancy in the code. Currently we are in the process of figuring out a better way to handle new protocols.; Having said that it should not stop users from using alevin with previous version of quartzseq2, you can use the following command line triplet as `--end 5 --barcodeLength 14 --umiLength 8` along with you other alevin flag and it's gonna behave just like `QuartzSeq2v31` you specified above.

The reason you see this behavior in 0.10.1 but not in 0.8.1 is because in 0.10.1 the error model is enabled by default, while it is not in 0.8.1. If you run the newest salmon with `--noErrorModel` (the default in 0.8.1), your sample runs to completion. However, using the error model helps (which is why I made it the default), so I'm trying to debug what's happening there. I'll keep you posted. One more point worth mentioning. I noticed you are passing a coordinate sorted BAM file. For quantification with salmon, you really should not be passing a coordinate sorted BAM. This is because Salmon expects the alignments to appear in a random order, which is important for how the streaming stochastic variational algorithm learns the auxiliary parameters. Sorting by coordinates biases the models towards the isoforms that appear earliest in the BAM file.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/231#issuecomment-394764686:196,error,error,196,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/231#issuecomment-394764686,4,['error'],['error']

Availability,"Hi @gambardella,. Thanks for the effort in tracking this down further. So, I tried running locally with more threads than we have physically, but the bug wasn't immediately triggered, so I'm guessing there is some stochasticity there. One thing that would be really helpful (given our lack of success in reproducing locally yet) is to find out if the issue is being caused by the compacted De Bruijn graph construction library, or prior to that. One way to do that is to ask the indexer to keep around the ""fixed fasta"", and then to see if that differs from we're producing locally on our machine. If you run the following command:. ```; salmon index -t gentrome.fa.gz -d decoys.txt -p 12 -i salmon_index --gencode --keepFixedFasta; ```. then there should be a file `salmon_index/ref_k31_fixed.fa` that is generated in the index directory. This is a fixed fasta file (removing ambiguous nucleotides, trimming polyA tails, removing sequences that are too short (<= k), etc.). In my runs, I get the same md5sum for this file, regardless of the number of threads:. ```; $ md5sum salmon_index/ref_k31_fixed.fa; ceaf3a96bfc2a65e70b6f3094d02491c salmon_index/ref_k31_fixed.fa; ```. could you see if you get something different (on a passing run, on a failing run, or on both)? If so, I might be able to replicate the bug by starting from your fixed fasta file, rather than from the original fasta files. Regarding your other question :. > Would you now advise to drop the ""-k 31""?. This should make no difference to the indexing procedure. While `-k` is an important parameter, 31 is the default value. Therefore, if you run the command without providing `-k` explicitly, it will use k=31.

Availability,"Hi @gringer,. Yes, we can add a section for this in the docs. It will replace the old way for specifying geometry soon, as its just easier and more flexible. We talk about it in the 1.4.0 release notes. I copy the relevant info below (@k3yavi pulled for the 1-based indexing and won out ... this time):. generic barcode / umi / read geometry syntax : Alevin learned to support a generic syntax to specify the read sequence that should be used for barcodes, UMIs and the read sequence. The syntax allows one to specify how the pattern corresponding to the barcode, UMI, and read sequence should be pieced together, and the syntax is meant to be intuitive and general. For example, one can specify the 10Xv2 geometry in the following manner using the generic syntax:. --read-geometry 2[1-end] --bc-geometry 1[1-16] --umi-geometry 1[17-26]. This specifies that the ""sequence"" read (the biological sequence to be aligned) comes from read 2, and it spans from the first index 1 (this syntax used 1-based indexing) until the end of the read. Likewise, the barcode derives from read 1 and occupies positions 1-16, and the UMI comes from read 1 and occupies positions 17-26. The syntax can specify multiple ranges, and they will simply be concatenated together to produce the string. For example, one could specify --bc-geometry 1[1-8,16-23] to designate that the barcode should be taken from the substring in positions 1-8 of read 1 followed by the substring in positions 16-23 of read 1. It is even possible to have the string pieced together across both reads, but that functionality is only available if you are running with --rad or --sketch and preparing a RAD file for alevin-fry. If you are running classic alevin, the barcode must reside on a single read. The robust parsing of the flexible geometry syntax is made possible by the cpp-peglib project.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/445#issuecomment-777884823:1587,avail,available,1587,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/445#issuecomment-777884823,4,"['avail', 'robust']","['available', 'robust']"
Availability,"Hi @guidohooiveld, . Regarding your questions:. (1) The motivation behind asking users to use Bioconda to install the binary is to limit the number of variables we may encounter when someone is reporting a bug --- i.e. if there are fewer distribution channels there is less maintenance overhead. Nonetheless, as you can see, I've had to make the binary available anyway, because it was the only way some people could easily get the program. Therefore, I think I'll start attaching binaries to releases again. (2) Yes, though this functionality is not part of Salmon itself. I *highly* recommend the [MultiQC](http://multiqc.info/) tool.

Availability,"Hi @jashapiro,. So there are definitely a few things going on here. The first is that you correctly diagnosed the missing cmd_info.json information when `alevin` is run in RAD mode. That was simply an oversight, and there is no reason that file shouldn't have been written. Second, there is also useful information that belongs in `meta_info.json` in the `aux_info` directory (like the SHA hash of the reference sequences); that was also missing but has now been added.; ; In addition to salmon's `alevin` command, each step of `alevin-fry` also writes some useful metadata when it executes. For example, there is a json file written by the `generate-permit-list` step, one written by the `collate` step, and one written by the `quant` step. We've never run into the problem of the output of `alevin-fry` overwriting the output of `alevin` because we use a directory structure where the output quantifications reside in a separate directory from the input RAD file. However, I can now see that if you're writing the quants in the same place as the input, then there will be a conflict in the file names, and the existing files will be overwritten with the new ones. I agree that both tools output useful information. I'm a *bit* ambivalent about assuming the salmon-generated files exist, and merging them into one output file, as I think there might be cases where those files aren't present and `alevin-fry` should still run properly since it doesn't require them to perform it's processing. One option would be to rename the `alevin-fry` output files to prefix/postfix them so they don't collide with the salmon files even if they live in the same directory. Then, one could (now or later) write a small command to merge the relevant json files into a unified output if that would be more convenient downstream. Let me know your thoughts.

First of all thank you so much for sharing this thorough analysis with us, it was very clear and helpful for understanding the details of the problem you are referring to. Secondly, I apologize for the long time it took me to get back at you. I would like you to know that we have been and are still working on possible solutions for addressing this problem, and here I would like to share some updates with you. . About the success cases, it was nice to know that the current model of Salmon with length correction works pretty well in recovering the right estimates for those ""easier"" cases where one transcript is fully contained in another one. Turning off the length correction, tells the Salmon model not to consider the effective length of each transcript for computing the conditional probabilities of originating a fragment from a transcript. So, for the RNA-seq data there is no reason to turn off this term of the model, and we highly recommend not to use that flag for the bulk RNA-seq abundance estimation with Salmon. Looking more carefully at the 2nd case you have posted as the failure case, it is interesting to see that there is a very nice visual evidence on the super transcript that the long transcript might not be expressed at all. I am referring to the zero coverage regions on the Super Transcript between the regions corresponding to the smaller transcripts, e. g., between POF1 and EMC1. So, we tried a solution that inspects the coverage profile of all transcripts and calculates the probability of observing a zero coverage region on each transcript. If this probability is too low, this would be counted as an evidence for a transcript not being expressed at all. This approach seems to be working fine on this example that you have shared here. however, one problem was that there were considerable number of reads in the sample that were uniquely mapping only to the Super Transcript and turning of the expression of that transcript would result in t",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/514#issuecomment-666512703:556,recover,recovering,556,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/514#issuecomment-666512703,2,['recover'],['recovering']

Availability,"Hi @jeremymsimon — @Gaura is going to take a look at unfiltered permit listing and will share those results here later. Regarding frameshift errors, I think that's certainly out of scope for the alevin -> fry phase, but that type of thing *could* be in scope for `splitp`. Basically, my logic / reasoning is this: I'd like to avoid further complicating the already immense salmon/alevin codebase with special implementations handling problems outside of their core function (e.g. mapping reads to the reference efficiently and quantifying UMIs/barcode). Since most protocols (and the most common) have quite simple barcode geometry, it makes sense for this code to live there. I'm fully supportive of enabling support for more complex barcode geometries and preprocessing requirements if there are folks whom it would help, but it feels like that essential complexity belongs upstream of alevin / fry, so that by the time the reads get to alevin, it can assume a straightforward geometry. So TLDR : I think we'd be willing to investigate what is required to address potential frameshift errors, and how much of a difference that makes, but I think that analysis and eventual implementation (if we decide it's worth it), belongs in `splitp`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-988030837:141,error,errors,141,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-988030837,4,['error'],['errors']

Availability,"Hi @jeremymsimon,. A few quick thoughts on this.; ; > -Is quantification via alevin-fry (rather than alevin itself) mandatory here? I ask since your run seems successful whereas my full alevin run had a very poor BC detection and mapping rate.; ; I don't think we've been able to successfully obtain the same concordance with alevin yet (as opposed to alevin-fry). There is more sophisticated _internal_ barcode logic going on there, and we may need to pull @k3yavi in to see what is happening outside of the RAD -> fry pipeline.; ; > -I see you specified -l A - can you comment on what the detected/correct library type was here?; ; Unlike `alevin`, when you run with in `--rad` or `--sketch` mode, the library type isn't really relevant. All mappings are passed through to the rad file. Subsequently, in `alevin-fry` there is a `-d` (direction) flag that is used to filter mappings that don't concord with the expected orientation. I'm not sure what @Gaura used in the run above — the default is to keep reads from either orientation.; ; > -I assume all of this will also work in conjunction with --expectCells or --keepCBFraction if those parameters were needed? Your ~7k cells detected is very close to the published number post-filtering, but no similar filtering has been done here yet. My guess is that the proportion of cells that pass these filters will be higher for alevin, but we may still be under-estimating the number of real cells by a little bit here.; ; According to the commands listed, @Gaura used `alevin-fry`'s built-in knee-like filtering. This tries to use a knee on the cumulative read count histogram to determine a good cutoff for ""reliable"" cells versus poor quality cells. Alternatively, one can provide an external permit list with `-u` (unfiltered permit list) to quantify all cells that match any known barcode. This will generally result in *many* more quantified cells, which you will then want to filter post-quantification.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-988011633:1659,reliab,reliable,1659,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-988011633,1,['reliab'],['reliable']
Availability,"Hi @jeremymsimon,. I've discussed the support for SPLiT-seq/ParseBio with @Gaura in some depth. Honestly, I think the cleanest solution right now is just to have a more streamlined (and streaming) way to match / replace the random hexamers upstream of alevin-fry. By my understanding, if we can simply replace barcode 1 appropriately (as your Perl script currently does), everything should work downstream in alevin/alevin-fry.; ; To that end, I've thrown together a small rust program based on your Perl script. Currently that lives [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/splitp). It reads the same basic parameters as the Perl script, and writes its output to stdout so that it can be used with named pipes. For example, something like:; ; ```; <normal salmon command> -1 read_file_1.fq -2 <(splitp --read-file read_file_2.fq --bc-map bcSharing_example.txt --start 79 --end 86 --one-hamming); ```. which will transform the second fastq file and stream the transformed reads out which can then be read by alevin-fry. One important thing to note is that while *alevin* requires the input reads to be a real file (i.e. you can't stream reads in because it does 2 passes), if you are mapping these reads for processing with *alevin-fry* you can use the process substitution trick above. As you hinted, this program works considerably faster than the Perl script. For example, for the first 10,000,000 reads in `SRR6750042`, the Perl script took 2m 48s to transform the reads and `splitp` took ~6s (if the output wasn't being written to a file on disk it took <4s). This should generally be fast enough to not be a speed bottleneck. So, perhaps the next step is to try to help you walk through this approach with a test dataset (and ideally using alevin-fry) to see if things are turning out as expected?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-961598108:395,down,downstream,395,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-961598108,2,['down'],['downstream']
Availability,"Hi @jeremymsimon,. So I'm trying to think about what issues _could_ be reasonably dealt with here. . 1) If the length of the sequence in the BAM header and the sequence provided in the FASTA file are different, this seems like a very difficult error to recover from since records can then contain alignments to bases about which we don't know. 2) If the same transcript appears multiple times in the input BAM header, but with different lengths, this also seems a difficult situation to allow. Exact duplicates are one thing, but I'm not sure if sequences ever appear with the same name but different lengths. If so, I'm thinking this would be a hard error. So, I think at least one situation we could reasonably deal with is that the input FASTA file contains multiple entries with the same name (and same length / sequence). In this case, we could retain only one of them, and document / log the fact that multiple identical entries were present in the input. Of course, there would still be an issue if we had a mismatch as with your example STAR input, where STAR concatenated all 3 occurences of an identical transcript. Are there other cases you can think of where it would make sense to somehow deal with the issue in salmon and continue with processing (perhaps with some extra warnings / log info)?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/282#issuecomment-418412904:244,error,error,244,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/282#issuecomment-418412904,3,"['error', 'recover']","['error', 'recover']"

Availability,"Hi @joshstolz,. Is there a reason you want to restrict the possible mapping to this set of 1800 transcripts? In general, mapping to a small subset of the reference is not ideal, because alignment works based on asking if the ""best hit"" for a read is good enough, so its easy to come up with scenarios where the is a read that matches some transcript very well, and another transcript ""alright"" --- if the transcript it matches very well is in the reference, then it will map there, otherwise it will likely map to the transcript where the match is just ""alright"". TLDR; the set of references included can affect the mappings. That being said, if there is a good technical reason you have for only including a subset of transcripts, that's easy to do. You just build your index on only those transcripts. Salmon treats the reference sequences you feed to it as the ""transcriptome"" and will map to that. Also, you could map to the full transcriptome and just extract the rows for these targets from the `quant.sf` files at the end. Of course, depending on what you want to do downstream, you'll have to be aware of how these 1800 transcripts fit into the bigger picture and how the reads that mapped to the other transcripts affect your belief about things like the effective library size etc.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/681#issuecomment-873025258:1074,down,downstream,1074,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/681#issuecomment-873025258,1,['down'],['downstream']

Availability,"Hi @k3yavi , thank you for the reply. Yes, you are right, it seems the problem is indeed in the whitelist `known_cb.txt`. However, I cannot seem to find out what exactly is going on with the file. When I wrote a python script to check the length of each cell barcode in `known_cb.txt`, _all_ of them are 16 bp long. This is the python script:. ```; $ cat print_length.py; with open('known_cb.txt') as fh:; for i in fh:; print(len(i)); ```. since each line has 16 bp barcode and a `\n` character, it outputs 17, which is expected. However, when I used `awk` to check the length, I expected `awk` to output 16, but it actually output 17:. ```; $ awk '{print length($0);}' known_cb.txt | head -2; 17; 17; ```. There might be some hidden characters that I missed. Any idea what's going?. Now, I have cleaned the `known_cb.txt`, and `alevin` runs without problem. For combinatorial indexing, good to known that it will be supported in future. I guess depending on assays, it needs to be a bit more flexible than the current options. The current options have only `--chromium` and `--dropseq` available. However, there are a few different combinatorial indexing assays. For `sci-RNA-seq`, the cell barcodes are within `I1.fastq`, `I2.fastq` and `R1.fastq`. Only `R2.fastq` is useful for gene quantification. For `sci-ATAC-seq`, the cell barcodes (this is just my educational guess) are within `I1.fastq` and `I2.fastq`, and both `R1.fastq` and `R2.fastq` contain useful information from the genome. For other plate-based method, there will be well barcodes and plate barcodes, which could be located in any of those 4 fastq files depends on the design. The cell barcodes will be a combination of well barcodes and plate barcodes. Thank you very much for the help.

Availability,"Hi @keithgmitchell,. Alevin is designed for droplet-based, tagged-end protocols, and in the vast majority of these protocols, transcript-level quantification isn't really reliable enough to be useful. Since most tagged-end protocols sequence information from only the 3' end of the transcripts, there is a highly-biased coverage signal, and discerning UMI assignment at the transcript level is usually not possible. Therefore, I wouldn't generally recommend trying to obtain transcript-level counts from alevin and we haven't tested it in this context. If you have a particular reason you want to look at transcript counts and believe it may be reasonable in your specific use-case, you can alway pass in a gene-to-transcript map that just maps each transcript to itself, which will result in a transcript-level output matrix. However, I anticipate that the resolution problem will become more difficult in this case, and there will be much more uncertainty in the assignments. @k3yavi, please feel free to add anything you think I may have missed. --Rob",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/588#issuecomment-729974232:171,reliab,reliable,171,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/588#issuecomment-729974232,1,['reliab'],['reliable']

Since the reads may not all be of the same size (perhaps the user has quality-trimmed the reads first and not opted to discard the short ones), it's possible we may see some reads too short to consider, but others would not be.

Availability,"Hi @klaas-men,. Thanks for the question and for the detailed report! This is an interesting observation. The most likely reason you are seeing this behavior is that the fast mapping algorithms are, in a sense, quite greedy in how they attempt to map reads. This can lead them to suffer with compared to more traditional alignment algorithms like Bowtie2 and BWA-MEM with respect to both sensitivity and specificity. Here, you are likely seeing a manifestation of the former. Specifically, greedy behavior can lead to spurious matches. Many of these spurious matches are filtered out when applying a consensus mechanism to the series of matches produced by a read; however, this can result in the read going unmapped. We have noticed this behavior where spurious matches can ""mask"" better overall mappings, and we have developed an algorithm to overcome these limitations (called selective-alignment). This is currently implemented in [this branch](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/rescue-orphan) of the Salmon repo (if you want to test it out and have trouble building, we can build you a linux executable). This algorithm explores more potential mappings and then applies a fast algorithm for filtering potentially poor ones. In our benchmarks, it exhibits sensitivity and specificity very close to Bowtie2 (which is among the best of the alignment-based methods we considered). Also, I will note that, though the speed and statistical optimization procedures used in fast transcript abundance estimation tools make them a potentially desirable choice for microbiomic / metagenomic abundance estimation, their indices are typically optimized for speed and not size. For small numbers of bacterial species this can be okay, but if one wishes to index large collections of species, the memory usage can become a problem. To this end, we have developed a new indexing scheme (software [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish), slightly out-of-date pre-print [here](https://www.biorxiv",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/196#issuecomment-365337297:775,mask,mask,775,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/196#issuecomment-365337297,1,['mask'],['mask']

Availability,"Hi @kvittingseerup,. No need to apologize, I think it was I who was not clear. What I am saying is that this is *already* the way that Salmon handles such a case. That is, if you have a paired-end read, and one of the reads maps but the other doesn't (due to e.g., adapter contamination or just very low quality), then Salmon will consider the remaining (mapping) end of the read as representative of an entire fragment, and will resolve the fragment origin accordingly during optimization. Generally, not having both ends of a paired-end read leads to increased ambiguity, but this isn't a particularly big problem if it only happens to a generally small fraction of the reads. Further, since you cannot reliably infer the implied fragment length on a transcript from only a single-end read, such mappings will not contribute to the bias model. Again, however, as long as this doesn't happen to the vast majority of fragments, it should have only a negligible effect on quantification and bias correction. Please let me know if this description makes sense.

Availability,"Hi @kvittingseerup,. Sorry for letting this sit for so long without responding. Currently, Salmon does not support mixed paired-end and single-end library types, so this is presumably what is causing the error (granted, the error message here could be considerably better). Practically, I'd be curious what the difference is between allowing this and simply running Salmon with the _non-quality-trimmed_ paired-end reads. Specifically, if Salmon is not able to map a pair concordantly, but it can map one of the ends of the read, then it will already do so. . However, in the case that there's a really compelling reason to want to quality trim the reads prior to quantification (and to include the reads such that the mate has been completely quality-trimmed away), we would be able to support this. It will require a bit of modification to allow different library types to be processed back to back and to contribute to the same quantification estimates. In this case, I imagine what we would want to do for the orphans is essentially what Salmon would do internally if it can't map the mate. That is, we would learn essentially all of the parameters and biases from the pairs that do map concordantly, and then just include the orphaned reads as indicating an entire fragment but of unknown length.

Availability,"Hi @lijing28101,. Thanks for your interest in salmon. The answer to your first question:. > I want to know how did you estimate the final counts to combine the unique and ambiguous counts?. is actually a huge part of the method behind salmon. Salmon uses a statistical estimation procedure to determine what abundances for the transcripts are most likely given the observed data (read alignments). You can read about the method in detail [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5600148/pdf/nihms849351.pdf) and about some subsequent improvements [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5870700/) and [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v2). > For the unstranded library, did you use the same algorithm to estimate the final counts as the stranded library? . The difference between stranded and unstranded is that in the stranded library, we set the conditional probability of alignments that don't agree with the specified strandedness to be a very-low, user-adjustable value (`--incompatPrior` : 0 by default). The underlying inference methodology is identical. Strand specificity, if the library was sequenced that way, provides extra signal to the quantification algorithm.

The tests above were using the python importer from [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pluribus). **Update**: Ok, that, too, has failed. I converted all of the quantifications to hdf5 files using wasabi, and then checked for nans in the converted files:. ```python; import h5py; import numpy as np; def get_num_nan(x):; nbs = int(x['aux']['num_bootstrap'].value[0]); s = 0; for i in range(nbs):; s += np.isnan(x['bootstrap']['bs{}'.format(i)].value).sum(); return s. samps = ['23R1F', '23R2F', '23R3F', '23R4F', 'R1ST1', 'R2ST1', 'R3ST1', 'R4ST1']; for s in samps:; d = h5py.File('quant/{}/abundance.h5'.format(s)) # abundance.h5 created by wasabi; null_count = get_num_nan(d); print(""{} : null count = {}"".format(s, null_count)); d.close(); ```.

Availability,"Hi @mishaprochazka and @jdidion,. Thanks @jdidion for pinging me on this. Somehow, Gmail has decided that all GitHub notifications (except those that explicitly tag me, but somehow I missed this one) should go to SPAM. So, I've been missing some of the newer issues here. The short answer is that the documentation needs to be updated. When salmon was originally published, we made use of [RapMap](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/RapMap) as the underlying mapper, which performed quasi-mapping against an index that consisted of a suffix array and a hash over k-mers pointing to prefixes in the suffix array (similar to the strategy used by STAR, but using much longer k-mers to improve lookup speed). We referred to this index as the quasi-index. As the software evolved and we continued to improve the mapping methodology, we eventually transitioned over to an index based on [our pufferfish data structure](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish). In addition to the new data structure, this coincided with our move over to selective-alignment as the mapping algorithm, and all of this happened at the 1.0.0 release (this is why, for example, indices built before 1.0.0 are not compatible with salmon > 1.0.0; a topic on which there have been a few GitHub issues). However, given the fact that the documentation and software are linked only through manual human intervention (we haven't leveled up to e.g. having salmon be a [literate program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) yet), these two sometimes get out of sync. This is an instance of that. We have maintained the functionality of the `--writeMappings` feature, and in fact, even augmented it. However, we have not replaced the antiquated `quasi-index` terminology in the documentation. The TLDR is that you can use `--writeMappings` with the index you built with the `salmon index` command, and it should work fine. If you are mapping against an index without decoy sequences, then the output format will be basically ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/727#issuecomment-996192524:54,ping,pinging,54,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/727#issuecomment-996192524,1,['ping'],['pinging']
Availability,"Hi @mohsenzakeri ,. Sorry for the slow reply! I’ve done some sleuthing and have (seemingly) figured out what’s going on. I compared tons of overlapping transcript scenarios and played with the salmon options and concluded the following:. 1. **Success scenarios:** Generally, with default options, Salmon does an excellent job at assigning reads to overlapping transcripts the same way that a human would. Whether or not the transcripts overlap slightly or one is entirely contained within another is irrelevant. 2. **Failure scenarios:** In some scenarios with overlapping transcripts, read assignment can be very strange and unintuitive, especially when one of the transcript isoforms is much more abundant than the other (the abundant transcript tends to “steal” reads from the less abundant one). 3. Both the success and failure scenarios are **due to the length bias model** used when estimating the abundance of transcripts. **Totally disabling this with the —noLengthCorrection flag** (NOT the —no**Effective**LengthCorrection flag) **actually *creates* the transcript within a transcript failure scenario that I mistakenly thought was the original issue.** That is, when length bias modeling is turned off, then longer transcripts will always get assigned *all* of the reads that multimap to shorter transcripts.; -Therefore... if you *did* want to tackle the transcript within a transcript scenario to build a coverage bias model, you probably want to disable the length bias modeling or at least consider how it would interact with coverage modeling. With that said, I'm sharing an example that illustrates each of the above points and a link to a toy dataset that you can use to recreate the examples or explore this further. If you'd like to dig deeper into this, free free to e-mail me at jason@calicolabs.com, I have tons more notes and data that I'm willing to share.

Availability,"Hi @moschmi ,. Thanks for sharing the file.; You are right the transcript id `PB.40054.21` is indeed present & has the gene mapping in the file you forwarded. Unfortunately, the specific error message was not useful here but the issue is the following: ; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8772521/85436584-45706f00-b557-11ea-9ba2-95ebf4e43bc4.png). If you check the file you forwarded from line number 12,133 - 12,137, it seems a bunch of transcript ids are blank and has no assigned gene-ids. In this case the file parser was not intelligent enough to ignore such empty mappings and end up using the next line (before) tab as the wrong mapped gene-mappings. Later, when alevin sanity checks for the mappings of all transcripts, alevin complaints about not being able to find it for a random transcript much lower in the order. In short, I know you used the bioawk script for making the transcript to gene mapping file, but the script was written with the gencode generated GTF in mind, it seems the one you have has some small difference which is creating the issue. Currently, the easiest fix is to parse the GFF file again and generate the mappings for all the transcript in the proper format.

Availability,"Hi @mr-c,. First of all, **thank you** for your monumental effort in supporting salmon as a Debian package. I think this is fantastic. I'm also not a CMake expert, but I've failed with it enough times to start to get a handle. I have actually moved to the latest version of Jellyfish (v2.2.3) in the [quasimapping branch](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/quasimapping), which will be merged back into master as soon as we've finished porting the bootstrapping feature from [sailfish-master](https://github.com/kingsfordgroup/sailfish). Regarding supporting external versions of the libraries — this absolutely makes sense. What is the standard location where they are assumed to be installed? In this case I can search with a `FindPackage` before I attempt to download them. From the list above, I see two potential problem libraries:; - bwa — We actually use a modified version of bwa that accepts and uses an extra parameter that specifies the suffix array sampling frequency. Specifically, we, by default, use a denser sampling of the suffix array to trade off extra space usage for more speed in lookup. The standard bwa, therefore, probably wouldn't work.; - jellyfish — I actually tried to use jellyfish without obtaining the source and building it early on in development. I ran into an issue where the config.h file generated during compile wasn't installed by Jellyfish, and this caused runtime failures when Salmon was running. It seems to me that either (1) config.h should be installed with jellyfish by default or (2) it shouldn't be necessary to use jellyfish as a library. However, as far as I know, this issue persists in the latest version of jellyfish (if you want to use it as a library as we do, and not just as a k-mer counter). For the remaining libraries, we just use the standard versions, so this should be _OK_.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/19#issuecomment-144721158:770,down,download,770,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/19#issuecomment-144721158,2,"['down', 'failure']","['download', 'failures']"

Unfortunately, there is a chance that the `mtx` format output is corrupted for the last 8 genes (in the order they present in the quants_mat_cols.txt), however, the baseline output of alevin `quants_mat.gz` would still be correct and already be in the output folder of your pipeline.

Availability,"Hi @pophipi ,; We are in process of documenting the details of these files generated by using flag `--dumpFeatures`.; However, for your use case of getting alignment rate, there are two ways to get it in Alevin system. First you have to run Aleivn with the flag `--dumpFeatures` but since you have the file `filtered_cb_frequency.txt` I think you already have specified this flag in your run of the dataset. The relevant files you need for generating alignment rate would be following:. 1. *filtered_cb_frequency.txt*: A *tsv* file with the first column as the Cellular Barcode(CB) id and the second column has the frequency of the CB after sequence correction.; 2. *MappedUmi.txt*: A *tsv* file with the first column as the Cellular Barcode(CB) id and the second column has the number of reads confidently mapped to the provided reference transcriptome. Both the file should have same number of rows (i.e. CB), although the order can be different. To get the Alignment rate you might have to divide the value of each CB in the second file by the value in the first file i.e. the Number of mapped reads over total number of available reads for that CB. The second and more easier way is (although version bounded i.e. if you have latest version of Salmon (v11.2)), then if you run alevin with `--dumpFeatures` flag it will also generate a file called `featureDump.txt`. This file has multiple feature entries although the relevant one (the alignment rate) in case of yours would be the first one. Hope that helps.

Availability,"Hi @qifei9,. Thanks for the question and for pointing out the need for update in the docs. Regarding your first question, both approaches (3) and (2) seem reasonable to me. I would *not* try approach (1) as this will eliminate the benefit of the stranded library for the targets where you do know the orientation. For approach (2) , I'd either use `--validateMappings` or at least set `--rangeFactorizationBins 4` (the former implies the latter). As for what value to set for `--incompatPrior`, the effect should be reasonably robust across a range of values, the question is how unlikely _a priori_ would you expect a mapping not in `ISR` orientation to be if you also observed a mapping in `ISR` ... probably very unlikely (you could try e.g. 1e-10 or some such). Approach 3 is also also reasonable, though what you might consider doing is looking at the abundances for these opposite strands of the same sequence post quantification --- you should generally see that one of the two has a non-zero expression, or at least one orientation should have a much higher expression than the other (for expressed transcripts, at least, this might give you evidence as to the true strand of origin).

The `lib_format_count.json` is as such:. ```; {; ""read_files"": ""[ SRR9071838_1.fastq.gz, SRR9071838_2.fastq.gz]"",; ""expected_format"": ""ISR"",; ""compatible_fragment_ratio"": 1.0,; ""num_compatible_fragments"": 31944161,; ""num_assigned_fragments"": 31944161,; ""num_frags_with_concordant_consistent_mappings"": 29445487,; ""num_frags_with_inconsistent_or_orphan_mappings"": 2576421,; ""strand_mapping_bias"": 0.000022006283676957945,; ""MSF"": 0,; ""OSF"": 0,; ""ISF"": 648,; ""MSR"": 0,; ""OSR"": 0,; ""ISR"": 29445487,; ""SF"": 1098610,; ""SR"": 1477163,; ""MU"": 0,; ""OU"": 0,; ""IU"": 0,; ""U"": 0; }; ```. As you can see, the strand mapping bias reported is `0.000022006283676957945` (to an insanely higher level of precision than we actually need). This is, of course, drastically different from the value of `0.36810071818291797` that showed up in your table for this sample. While it is true that salmon is quite conservative about calling a library as stranded (i.e. it would rather make the mistake of calling stranded library as unstranded than vice-versa, as the latter would discard reads while the former would not), in this case it looks like the culprit is likely the transcriptome reference being used. When quantified under the standard gencode transcriptome, this sample is inferred as `ISR` with very high confidence ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/655#issuecomment-825393464:135,down,down,135,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/655#issuecomment-825393464,2,['down'],['down']
Availability,"Hi @radlinsky,. I've downloaded the read data and am looking into this. In the meantime, I did notice some relevant output from your log. First, when I run with the automatic library type, I get that the most likely library type is `ISF` rather than `ISR`. Second, I note that ~4M fragments are discarded because they produce dovetailing reads. We discard dovetailing reads by default (this was a recent change in default behavior, though it is the same default choice made by e.g. Bowtie2). You can allow these reads to be mapped and quantified by passing salmon the `--allowDovetail` flag during quantification.

In our experiments, we find that, in expectation, the 10x generated experiments are clean enough that we don't need the 10x whitelisted barcode to be explicitly specified or used. > And do you recommend using the `--naiveEqclass` only 64 guide sequences as features ?. That's a very good question. Basically the answer lies in how complicated the UMI graph network is. Experiment with the antibody derived barcodes (ADT) with 20 protein panel, generally, doesn't need the `--naiveEqclass` mode UMI deduplication, unless the experiment is super deeply sequenced. However, for super low diversity like 4-8 barcodes e.g. for HTO like sample barcodes, the graphical network becomes exponentially hard to solve and significantly increases the running time for alevin. . In general, I'd recommend if you expect very low diversity in the number of barcodes in your experiment, use `--naiveEqclass` otherwise prefer avoiding it. Generally, the experiment with low diversity barcodes results in such a highly dense count matrix that a few error in UMI deduplication won't matter and you can tradeoff extra long running time with reasonable under/over UMI deduplicated counts. . _In short_, 64 guide sequences are relatively high diversity and I'd advise skipping `--naiveEqclass` in your command line argument.

We both cannot change what has already been published, however, when we write something ourselves, we can change the paradigm and represent things correctly. Also, the preprint paper has similar wordings that you might want to reconsider changing:. ```To obtain homologous sequences within a reference, we map the spliced transcript sequences against a version of the genome where all exon segments are hard-masked (i.e. replaced with N).

Availability,Hi @rob-p . Thanks for the elaborate answer - makes a lot of sense. The problem is that adapter contamination typically occures because the fragments were smaller than the sequence length we sequence into the adapters - and it can occur for a larger fraction of the reads (I've seen up to 50% of reads affected in the 3'end) making it non-negligible. That is why I suggested the extension in the first place. I think it makes a lot of sense to trim adapters away - both because they reduce the number of compatible reads - mostly because the failure to do so will result in an overestimation of the fragment length. . Now that I think about it I don't think we should trim reads based on quality as that will lead to an underestimation of the read length - or what do you think?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/150#issuecomment-355909325:542,failure,failure,542,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/150#issuecomment-355909325,1,['failure'],['failure']

Availability,"Hi @rob-p,. I was finally able to grab some time to try running the beta version you linked (see attached logs). This certainly helped, although I'm still nowhere near a time-frame of ~30min. Here are my results:. The 31-mer running took a bit over an hour and consumed ~17GB of memory. This is about half the running time as the previous version, but approx. the same amount of memory requirement (more on that below). The 17-mer running, took 4.5hrs to complete and consumed ~64GB of memory. This particular running is again, about twice as fast, although the time really depends on the memory limitations I gave it. Since it appears that this version no longer crashes when given less than about 250GB of memory, I also tested with 32G and 16GB of memory, just to see what impact this would have on the times. Those jobs are still running (it's only been about 4hrs as of this writing, I'll update my post if/when they complete). Current logs are showing that they quickly consume all the available memory, but have not yet crashed. I've also got versions with 128-512GB of memory requested (by powers of 2) for comparison.

The 17-mer version experienced fewer page reclaims than any of the 31-mer indices and far fewer than with the prior version.

Thanks for the suggestion, I've now been investigating the potential of an index-related issue. Firstly, I downloaded the pre-built salmon index from refgenie using `refgenie pull hg38/salmon_sa_index`. I then ran `salmon quant` using this index and the singularity image of salmon v1.9.0. What, would you know: it worked in about 11 minutes. ```; <truncated>; [2023-02-23 14:46:31.892] [jointLog] [info] Aggregating expressions to gene level; [2023-02-23 14:46:32.452] [jointLog] [info] done; ```. This pre-built index does appear to be decoy-aware:. ```; [2023-02-23 14:38:21.709] [jointLog] [info] Number of decoys : 195; [2023-02-23 14:38:21.709] [jointLog] [info] First decoy index : 177412 ; ```. Secondly, I created a new transcriptome-only salmon index (`singularity run -B /data $SALMON_SIMG salmon index -t genome.transcripts.fa -i salmon_index -k 31`), then ran `salmon quant` again (as above) but using the new transcriptome-only index. Note: 'genome.transcripts.fa' is the transcripts file created during the `nf-core/rnaseq` pipeline. Again, this analysis completed properly in a reasonable time. Seems like there is something very wrong with the 'gentrome.fa' file that's being created by `nf-core/rnaseq`! It's just so odd that _some_ samples would work and others wouldn't. 2. It's definitely worth noting that I originally opted against using `star_salmon` with the following command:. ```; nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq --max_memory 55.GB --fasta /data/reference_genomes/GRCh38/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna_sm.primary_assembly.fa.gz --gtf /data/reference_genomes/GRCh38/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.106.gtf.gz -",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/830#issuecomment-1441194948:494,down,downloaded,494,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/830#issuecomment-1441194948,1,['down'],['downloaded']

Availability,"Hi @rudondamba,. Thanks for the report. At salmon v1.0.0, there was a breaking change in the index used in salmon. We moved from using the RapMap index to using a [pufferfish based index](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish). This means that, you'll want to rebuild your index using a recent version of salmon. Further, the move to the pufferfish index drops support for the FMD-like index, so you can remove the `--type` argument. With a new version of salmon you should be able to do:. ```{bash}; salmon index -t galGal6.gene+cluster+repBase+tRNA.fa -i SalmonIndex -k 31 -p 8; ```. the `-p` is optional and tells salmon to use 8 threads during indexing. Also, the default `k` is 31, so you don't need to pass that explicitly if don't want. Best,; Rob. P.S. It's worth noting that, even after this, there is still one small problem with your FASTA input file. You have an empty sequence name on line `30445`. More specifically, you have a record named `> NM_001318772.1_Unfound_-`. Note the space between the `>` and the record name. This is not allowed, and leads to an error in parsing the file.

Availability,"Hi @s1corley . As @rob-p mentions, your paper could help assess different methodologies for quantification and also help optimize salmon further for QuantSeq.

Similar to the above htseq command line arguments, I think if you are using QuantSeq FWD, the` libType argument from salmon quant should have been SF` . One way I checked these with my datasets was to run the salmon quant command 3 times - once with `libType A`, once with` libType SF` and once with `libType SR` -- with QuantSeq FWD the estimated counts will be almost same with libType A and libType SF.

Availability,"Hi @shanmugavadivelps,. This is because, to properly find and link libiconv, the build requires a version of CMake that ships with FindIConv.cmake.

Availability,"Hi @shnmunk,. Yes, the `--noLengthCorrection` flag is recommended for nanopore based quantification. We expect (and generally observe) that there is not a fragmentation effect in ONT data. Therefore, it is recommended that you use the `--noLengthCorrection` flag with ONT data. You are correct that this make the setting of `--fldMean` and `--fldSD` irrelevant, since there is no length effect applied during the EM algorithm. The other point of note is that selective-alignment is not really designed for long reads, so folks typically use salmon with external alignment for quantifying long-read data (minimap2 is a popular choice). Currently, it's necessary to turn off the read error model `--noErrorModel` when processing long-read alignments, as the long read error profiles are very different form those of short reads. However, this is a temporary issue, as a long-read error model has been developed and is in the pipeline. For the time being though, `--noErrorModel --noLengthCorrection` is the relevant set of flags to get the best results with long-read RNA-seq (either cDNA or direct RNA).

Availability,"Hi @silvernano,. Though alignment stringency parameters can have an effect here, the problem of comparing the abundance of a specific transcript within the context of different annotations is more fundamental. That is, apart from the transcript of interest, the ""background"" of related transcripts may be different. Consider the following case:. You have an annotation with 2 transcripts annotated for your gene:. ```; [A, B, C]; [A,C]; ```. Where `A`, `B`, and `C` are exons and the `[A,B,C]` notation means the transcript is exon `A`, followed by `B`, followed by `C`. Now, imagine that in annotation 2, you just have:. ```; [A,C]; ```. That is, the other isoform `[A, B, C]` is missing from annotation 2. Now, imagine that, in reality, `[A,B,C]` is highly expressed in your sample and `[A,C]` is lowly expressed. Under annotation 1, you get (correct) high expression for `[A,B,C]` and low expression for `[A,C]`. However, in annotation 2, since you still have to describe the `A` reads and the `C` reads, you get high expression for `[A,C]` since the reads contained within `A` and within `C` still map well there — the reads that map to `B` and to the `A-B` and `B-C` junction will likely just go un-mapped (which explains a difference in mapping rate). Now if you compare `[A,C]` across databases ... you will see big differences. This is not really related to the alignments that are observed, but rather how the data (reads) must be explained conditioned on the transcriptome (annotation) you have available. In other words, in loci with substantial unannotated transcription, the annotation used can definitely have a considerable effect on the quantification results. How to best assess, detect, and mitigate these effects is an active area of research, but I can point you at papers like [this](https://www.life-science-alliance.org/content/2/1/e201800175) and [this](https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/pdfExtended/S2405-4712(19)30381-3).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/525#issuecomment-639057440:1505,avail,available,1505,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/525#issuecomment-639057440,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"Hi @sjackman , Thanks for you question. It is indeed a good observation to use salmon for combining separate CB and read-sequence fastq files.; Having said that, we have designed alevin to work with, and tested it on 10x-chromium `cellranger` pipeline which itself has a feature similar to mentioned above by you (enabled by flag `--dumpfq`). This feature takes in two separate files: one with CB+UMI and another with read-sequence, and performs initial whitelisting (knee based , more intelligent whitelisting happens downstream and needs deduplicated UMI counts or one can just optionally provide external whitelist), error corrects the CB, attaches it to the header (although not with tag `BX:Z`) of the read-sequence in the second file, and dumps it to the standard out. I might have to read a bit about `longranger` and its `FASTQ` format, but if you are familiar with the `longranger` pipeline and are sure that it uses 16+10 (CB+UMI) in one file and read-sequence in the second file, then I think you are good to try alevin with `--dumpfq` flag.

We link, in the README, to some pre-constructed decoy-aware transcriptomes, but you can build your own for any organism where you have the transcriptome, the genome, and an annotation, using the script Avi linked to. There are a few ways to enable selective alignment, and the details are listed with the relevant flags in the release notes (we will be updating the documentation shortly with more detailed examples as well). Specifically, you can pass salmon the `—validateMappings` flag, which turns on selective alignment with some reasonable default parameters. You can, instead, pass the flag `—mimicBT2`, which is a meta-flag that enables selective alignment, and turns on a few other things that make the alignments more similar to the Bowtie2 parameters we discuss in the paper (e.g. it disallows orphan alignments). Finally, there is the `—mimicStrictBT2` flag, which mimics Bowtie2 parameters that disallow indels; however, we generally don’t recommend this flag unless you have a particular reason for using it. For any of these, once you’ve built a decoy-aware index, you need not do anything else special during quantification.

Availability,"Hi @tillea and @nileshpatra,. Ok, I dug deeper and found out what's going on. The culprit is, in fact, `libcereal`. The problem is that `libcereal` bumped patch versions only since the version corresponding to the headers included in `pufferfish`, but their changes are not, in fact, backwards compatible! This lead to a version mismatch between the headers used in `pufferfish` and the headers found from the installed package, ultimately resulting in an assertion failure in `rapidjson` (which cereal is using) and a segfault. On the plus side, this was relatively easy to fix by bumping the included cereal headers in pufferfish. I also updated the `Findcereal.cmake` module and added a version constraint so that we now require the new version (1.3.2). This is now tagged and released as `salmon 1.10.1`. Please give that a go when you have a chance. I'll note that, before this is added upstream in debian, I'd still advocate for fixing the `libstaden` package to update to the new version. I'd also recommend moving to dependencies like the ones I've included above to remove some really antiquated dependencies that salmon no longer requires but are still being pulled in.

Availability,"Hi @tillea,. It seems this is exactly the problem. The build deps here are not quite correct. There are dependencies that salmon no longer has, and some of the dependencies it does have are out of date and can't be used from upstream (e.g. libstaden in the latest version, among others). On the bright side, it's not the dynamic linking alone that is problematic. The following works fine on my end:. ```{bash}; $ docker pull debian:testing; $ docker run -it debian:testing; $ echo ""deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian unstable main"" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/10-debsrc.list; $ apt-get update; $ apt-get upgrade; $ apt-get install build-essential git libboost-all-dev liblzma-dev libbz2-dev cmake zlib1g-dev curl unzip wget libcurl4-openssl-dev libtbb-dev libtbb12 liblzma-dev libjemalloc2 pkg-config libgff-dev; $ wget https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/archive/refs/tags/v1.10.0.tar.gz; $ tar xaf v1.10.0.tar.gz; $ cd salmon-1.10.0; $ mkdir build && cd build; $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_SHARED_LIBS=TRUE -DBZIP2_LIBRARIES=-lbz2 -DBZIP2_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include -DLIBLZMA_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/ -DLIBLZMA_LIBRARY=lzma -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=/usr/share/cmake/Modules -DTBB_WILL_RECONFIGURE=FALSE -DBOOST_WILL_RECONFIGURE=FALSE ..; $ make -j8; $ make install; $ make test; ```. This is preferring dynamic linking, and the resulting installed executable runs fine without a segfault. Can you try this on your end?

Availability,"Hi @tillea,. So I went through the list of deps pulled in by `apt build-dep salmon` and the minimal set I gave above. I tried to make the smallest number of changes I could to the `apt build-dep salmon` list while also removing things that are clearly outdated (we no longer use jellyfish, rapmap, etc. and we use the header-only version of spdlog). As a result I came up with this list of dependencies. The offending dependency seems to be `libcereal-dev`. Specifically, I was able to install just this list of dependencies (minus `libcereal-dev`) atop a clean `debian:testing` and get a working version where the only thing downloaded from the internet was the appropriate version of the pufferfish files grabbed by `fetchPufferfish.sh` in the `1.10.0` release. Once I installed `libcereal-dev` with `apt-get install`, and rebuilt, then I got the segfault mentioned at the top of this issue. So, it seems that we either have to let `salmon` build it's own libcereal, or figure out what the problem is with the library upstream. Please let me know if this you observe this same behavior as well (also @nileshpatra may want to try this out). If so, perhaps we can get `libstaden` updated upstream, and then use this as the new dep list for `salmon`.

Both `--seqBias` and `--gcBias` are relatively new features, and have definitely undergone more testing under the ""quasi-mapping"" codepath than the alignment-based codepath (though it's passed our internal regression tests on both). That being said, bias correction is equally valid regardless of whether you're using quasi-mapping or quantifying from a bam file directly. I'd be happy to take a look if you can provide a small example (a subset of the reads in the bam file?) that triggers the behavior. One thought might be that, for some reason, positions in the bam file could disagree with what's provided in the corresponding fasta.

Availability,"Hi @vertesy ,. Thanks for asking the very interesting question.; I'd say the answer might depend on what's your downstream use case. Traditionally, no quantification pipeline, in my knowledge, has used the pre-mRNA counts alone to bump up the gene counts, however, recent method of estimating RNA-velocity does utilizes the intronic counts for extracting the ratio of spliced/unspliced counts. If you are interested in disjoint signals (gene count matrix) for spliced and unspliced molecules you can use the recent scheme of decoy indexing from our latest [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v2). We (mostly @csoneson) have been testing alevin with following scheme for generating spliced and unspliced counts. 1.) Spliced Counts: Index transcriptome w/ pre-mRNA sequence as the decoys.; 2) Unspliced Counts: Index pre-mRNA sequence w/ transcriptome as the decoys. The third case is a little tricky because if you index both pre-mRNA and transcriptome, due to relatively longer length of pre-mRNA sequence compared to transcripts it might end-up biasing the UMI deduplication algorithm towards unspliced counts. To summarize, the best way to have an additive spliced and unspliced counts is still an open area of research.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/450#issuecomment-555136444:112,down,downstream,112,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/450#issuecomment-555136444,1,['down'],['downstream']

Availability,"Hi @warrenmcg,. Thanks for this bug report. This error is caused by the `--useVBOpt` argument. The telltale sign that this is the cause is that the exception contains the text `Exception : [Error in function boost::math::digamma<long double>(long double): Evaluation of function at pole -nan]; salmon quant was invoked improperly.` The digamma function is used only in the `useVBOpt` codepath. . I can say that this behavior is never expected (i.e. it's not the case that due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm we sometimes expect to evaluate the digamma function on an argument of `-nan`). Actually, even if one could set a randomization seed, he could not make salmon purely deterministic unless it was restricted to a single thread. This is because the order in which reads are observed during the online phase of the algorithm can change, as a result of the multithreaded read parser (which is _ok_ since the absolute order of the reads in the file is, itself, random). What I suspect is that there is some corner case here where the argument to the `digamma` function should be checked for validity before the `digamma` function is called. The key, of course, is to find a small example that will reproduce this behavior so that the bug can be tracked down and fixed. In the meantime, my recommendation would be to remove the `--useVBOpt` option to Salmon. In this case, it will use the standard (rather than variational Bayesian) EM algorithm, which should yield similarly accurate results.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/48#issuecomment-196848149:49,error,error,49,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/48#issuecomment-196848149,3,"['Error', 'down', 'error']","['Error', 'down', 'error']"
Availability,"Hi @yeodynasty,. There are two different ways to tackle this question. The first relies on the fact that the correction employed by salmon for GC bias is done via the adjustment of transcript effective lengths. Here, you could compare the effective length in the quant.sf file to the effective length you would get ignoring GC-fragment (or other bias). Granted, the latter is not written down in the file here, but it is straightforward to calculate since salmon also writes out the fragment length distribution. ; The effective length discarding bias estimates is simply the transcript length, minus the mean of the conditional fragment length distribution (the fragment length distribution from 0 up to the transcript length, re-normalized to be an appropriate probability distribution). If you look at the differences between these values, you can infer how much bias correction was applied. Specifically, when the bias-corrected length is longer than the non bias-corrected length, then these transcripts are over-represented in sequencing and the bias correction aims to reduce their estimated abundance. On the other hand, when the bias-corrected length is shorter than the non bias-corrected length, then these transcripts are under-represented in sequencing and the bias correction aims to increase their estimated abundance.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/578#issuecomment-717267531:388,down,down,388,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/578#issuecomment-717267531,2,['down'],['down']

Availability,"Hi Andrea,. The bias correction time depends on the number of expressed transcripts. There is a flag to speed it up `--biasSpeedSamp`. It takes a value by which to downsample the fragment length pmf for bias modeling. The larger this number, the faster bias correction will become. The default is 1, and is super conservative (we are probably going to make the default 5 in the next release because it is much faster with no real difference in modeling quality). In fact, values up to at least 10 seem to work quite well with respect to the baseline.

More importantly, afaik there is no relevant `libpufferfish-dev` package (we certainly have not made one), and so there is not even e.g. a check in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Salmon's build always tries to run `fetchPufferfish.sh` to download the relevant `pufferfish` source files needed to build `salmon`. Critically, the relevant `pufferfish` dependencies and `salmon` releases move in lockstep. Each new `salmon` release it accompanied by a new tag in the `pufferfish` repo (so that the specific source used to build a given `salmon` release is fixed and easily trackable). So, I think the easiest way to move forward is to:. * do a diff of my list of packages above with what is pulled in by `apt build-dep salmon`. * figure out why, even when `libjemalloc2` is installed, the build system tries to build `jemalloc` itself (maybe we need the dev package?). * determine what folks want to do upstream about the lockstep pufferfish dependency. Right now, the `fetchPufferfish.sh` script pulls a tagged tarball from github and checks that the sha matches, and moves the relevant source files into place.

Availability,"Hi Avi, thanks for your detailed explanation!. From my understanding: a pre-selection of high-quality cells based on 1) CB frequency - finding the knee point (in the initial whitelisting) and 2) other features (in finalized/intelligent) whitelisting is performed in alevin, while [cell ranger count](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/algorithms/overview#cell_calling) does step 1) related to the `--expectCells` number and used an alternative method w/o knee point estimation. . Based on above, the newly included cells w/ increased number of `--expectCells` are also more likely to be filtered out in later steps using criteria such as `min of number of features/reads` detected per sample. But such filtering may not be expected if interests are also on cells with small transcriptomes such as TILs. I will try some downstream filtering to see how many good cells I can get. .

Availability,"Hi Avi,. Thanks for the detailed reply. I was able to run it (see logs below), but I had to use `ISR`, not `ISF` to get it to work. I also had to add these two settings as well; `--freqThreshold 1 --lowRegionMinNumBarcodes 100`. . I am not sure why the `ISF` option didn't work, but probably it has something to do with the guide sequences I was provided. At any rate, I have a few other questions I hope you can help me answer. 1. Why does increasing --maxNumBarcodes to 200000 results in no barcodes getting corrected? (See log for Run 2 below). What is the rationale for the current default of 100000? ; 2. For the downstream analysis of such data, I usually work with both the read and UMI counts, but `quants_mat.gz` only contains the UMI counts. Can Alevin a produce a matrix of read counts as well. It would be a great feature to add. For now, what is easiest way to get the cell x feature matrix of read counts if I use the ` --dumpEq` or `--dumpBfh` flags? Can *tximport* be used for this or do I need to use the Python [parser]([https://github.com/k3yavi/vpolo/blob/master/vpolo/alevin/parser.pyl]) first?.

Availability,"Hi Brian,. In general, I would argue that one should be cautious with removing PCR duplicates in RNA-seq data (unless you are dealing with reads with UMI tags). This is because reads that align to the same reference position can easily have come from alternative transcripts sharing the same underlying sequence. Hence, the normal tests used to infer PCR duplicates with e.g. DNA-seq reads can yield false-positives in RNA-seq. This is particularly true for highly abundant transcripts (or transcripts from highly-abundant genes). We are currently working on the code that will do duplicate removal when UMI tags are present. That methodology can be extended to remove duplicates even without UMI tags --- though I'd generally caution against that for the reasons mentioned above. However, for the time being, if you have a strong need or desire to filter PCR duplicates, you could use alignment-based Salmon with a BAM file that has duplicates removed. Finally, regarding the error you are getting during SAM validation; this sounds like a different issue. Would you mind providing a piece of that SAM file for me to take a look at? Specifically, I don't believe the quasi-mapping output file should even contain unmapped reads (unless you consider unmapped mates of orphaned reads). --Rob",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/136#issuecomment-305317281:977,error,error,977,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/136#issuecomment-305317281,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"Hi James,. Indeed! No problem. Looking at the older annotation, it seems that the transcripts have slightly different lengths:. ```; >ENST00000617214 ensembl:known chromosome:GRCh38:CHR_HSCHR8_8_CTG1:1973878:2006943:1 gene:ENSG00000273645 gene_biotype:protein_coding transcript_biotype:protein_coding. >ENST00000320248 ensembl_havana_transcript:known chromosome:GRCh38:8:1973878:2006936:1 gene:ENSG00000176595 gene_biotype:protein_coding transcript_biotype:protein_coding; ```. I don't know if that's the _only_ difference between them or if they are spliced differently in the middle etc. Both salmon and seqkit only check for *exact* sequence duplication.

Well, yes and no. We make extensive use of the position when estimate the implied fragment length (distance between paired end reads) and then model the conditional probability of this fragment based on the global fragment length distribution. This is just as much as is done by e.g. RSEM. However, you are right that there is no notion of using the coverage profile in estimation (more on this below)!. > Also, my intuition for these transcripts is not really a coverage ""bias"" . My intuition agrees with yours here completely. First, this isn't really a coverage bias as we use the normal definition of the term. Second, the positional bias modeling in salmon is not on a per-transcript level (since that would be an astronomical number of different parameters to learn, and any procedure would almost certainly overfit). Instead, it groups transcripts into length bins, and learns a distinct coverage bias model per-bin. > It would be neat if Salmon could detect these kinds of dramatic dropoffs and add a warning or something... even if not incorporating the information into the quants... it could even be a good QC step to identify large deletions/insertions over a gene body.

Availability,"Hi Kivanc,. Thanks for the kind words, and thank you for the _extremely detailed_ report. Reports like this are a model of what every developer wishes a user did before filing an issue :). First, let me clear up what seems like might be a small source of confusion. Since both of the salmon runs are from v1.1.0, _neither_ of these are making use of quasi-mapping. Specifically, newer versions of salmon _only_ perform selective alignment (and this makes the `--validateMappings` command line argument redundant in newer versions, though we keep it so as to maximize backward compatibility with command line parameters people may be using). So, the main difference between your two salmon runs is inclusion of the decoy set. This almost certainly means that the reads that map in your second set of salmon runs but not your first are being assigned to decoys in the first case. To try and get a better handle on this, could you upload a `meta_info.json` file from both runs? This file lives in the `aux_info` directory, and it will provide information about e.g. how many reads were best mapped to decoys and were discarded for this reason. The guarantee you get from the selective alignment is that, if the fragment is discarded by decoy mapping, it maps _strictly better_ to the decoy than to the non-decoy sequence. There are many reasons this could happen. One is rRNA contamination, another could be that reads are coming from processed pseudogenes that are not properly in your annotation, yet a third is that your sample has a considerable fraction of reads spanning exon-intron junctions (in this case, the read will map better to the corresponding location on the genome, and worse to the annotate transcript where the intronic sequence is not present). Now, figuring out exactly which of these cases you are in is a bit more difficult, but one approach would be to pick one of the samples with the biggest differences and map to the reads to the genome with e.g. STAR or HISAT2 to see what y",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/479#issuecomment-578848875:502,redundant,redundant,502,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/479#issuecomment-578848875,2,['redundant'],['redundant']
Availability,"Hi Kristoffer,. The duplicate transcript issue is a frustrating one. It came to our attention when we noticed that ensembl often annotated transcripts on patch / haplotype contigs that were identical and unlikely to be different from more ""canonical"" transcripts in any way. Further, these transcripts are indistinguishable from the quantification perspective. That being said, the removal of sequence duplicate transcripts is optional in Salmon. If you pass `--keepDuplicates` to the indexer, it wont remove them. Also, Salmon does record, in the index directory, the ""collapsing map"". Specifically, there is a tsv file that record, for every collapsed transcript, the transcript that was sequence identical and retained in the index. You can use this map to recover the abundances for the collapsed transcripts, since they are all sequence identical, they should all have an abundance of x / num duplicates (where x is the abundance of the retained transcript).

Availability,"Hi Rob!; I think I got it, I might have posted too soon, I was too eager to run the latest Salmon :). Basically, for the first part of my question, if anyone else happens to run into here:; To successfully run Salmon Index 1.0.0+, three inputs are required:; 1. Transriptome FASTA; 2. Concatenated Transcriptome+Genome FASTA; 3. List of decoys (most likely the list of all contigs from the Genome FASTA); So on from version 1.0.0, any supplementary scripts aren't needed (as you properly specified in your latest instructions). . Regarding the second part of my question, the ERCC contigs and the error that Salmon Index gave:; The reason for this was that my ERCC entries look like this:; `ERCC-00002 ERCC exon 1 1061 0.000000 + . gene_id ""ERCC-00002""; transcript_id ""ERCC-00002"";`; i.e. the contig name and the transcript name is identical. ; This means that there will exist an entry in the Transcriptome FASTA file labeled as ERCC-00002, and an entry in the Genome FASTA file labeled as ERCC-00002.; Then, in the concatenated Transcriptome+Genome FASTA, there will first be transcript sequence ERCC-00002, and then a genome sequence ERCC-00002, which is labeled as decoy. ; Hence the error: non-decoy, then some decoys, then again the ERCC-00002 as non-decoy. So my solution here was just to omit the ERCC entries both from the decoy list and from the genome FASTA that gets concatenated to the transcriptome. They're still kept in the transcriptome FASTA, as this allows to look for expression results of these transcripts for downstream absolute normalization.

Availability,"Hi Ryan,. Thanks for your kind words regarding salmon! First, I'll point out that *if it is desired*, you can also use STAR+Salmon in much the same way you've used STAR+RSEM (though STAR+salmon will be faster). To your question, if you want to use salmon's built-in selective-alignment, while choosing a k-mer length for this data, then the general rule of thumb is that the k-mer length should not be much longer than about half of the read length. In general, the alignment procedure and ultimate quantification are pretty robust to the specific choice of k, but you may want to try out a few values for one or two samples. Given these read lengths, I'd probably choose a value in {21, 23, 25}. If you have any follow-up questions after looking at those results, I'd be happy to discuss further!.

Availability,"Hi Ryan,. The difficulty is, indeed, exactly as you specify. Given a single-end read, one does not know the length of the _fragment_ from which it originates. In this case the ""right"" thing to do (the best thing we can do) is to consider the read as starting / ending a fragment of every possible length allowed by the user-provided fragment length distribution (with the contribution of each possible fragment weighted by the probability of observing a fragment of that length). In order to make this computationally feasible, one would have to do some clever pre-computation and thing a bit more about how to efficiently update the observed GC model (right now, each mapping contributes a single weight to the model, but under the naive implementation in the single-end case, each mapping would contribute different weights to each bin of the observed GC-bias curve, which would slow things down considerably). Also, as you point out, the quality of the correction would depend somewhat on the user providing appropriate parameters for the fragment length distribution mean and standard deviation — but this seems reasonable in the single-end case. That being said, I'm sure there's a way to handle this efficiently, I'd just have to think about it a bit. Regarding your second question; Salmon learns the fragment length distribution in paired-end data, but not with single-end data. Single-end data can provide a little bit of information (e.g. there is in upper bound on fragment lengths that one can infer based on single-end reads based on how far they map from the end of the transcript), but not enough information to reliably infer a fragment length distribution. cc @mikelove in case he has any thoughts on this.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/83#issuecomment-243833424:893,down,down,893,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/83#issuecomment-243833424,4,"['down', 'reliab']","['down', 'reliably']"
Availability,"Hi Salmon developers,. I wonder if Salmon can handle both paired-end reads, and single-end orphan reads from the same library as inputs. These inputs reads are from trimmomatic outputs, which would generate 4 files: Paired-end reads both pass QC, and 2 of the orphan forward or reverse reads that also passed QC. . In my project, I found that for all of my 49 samples (~25M PE reads/sample), I had about ~70% of reads from each sample are Paired-end both pass QC, and another ~25% are orphan reads (expectedly majority are forwarded reads). 25% seems to be too big for me, so I was thinking to utilize those orphan reads. . Since I wasn't sure if Salmon can handle these inputs in the same run, I initiated 2 runs of salmon, one for PE, one for SE, as follows:; ```; # Mapped PE pass QC; parallel -a data/raw_filenames.txt -j 3 --results logs/salmon_map_PE/ --joblog logs/salmon_map_PE.log \; salmon quant -i data/reference/MmvM27_salmon_ind -l IU \; -1 data/qc/{}_O1_paired.fastq.gz \; -2 data/qc/{}_O2_paired.fastq.gz \; -p 8 \; --validateMappings \; --recoverOrphans \; --allowDovetail \; --useVBOpt \; --seqBias \; -o data/mapped_salmon/{}_quant &. # Mapped SE pass QC; # --fldMean and --fldSD is set based on the PE run results; parallel -a data/raw_filenames.txt -j 3 --results logs/salmon_map_SE/ --joblog logs/salmon_map_SE.log \; salmon quant -i data/reference/MmvM27_salmon_ind -l U \; -r data/qc/{}_O1_unpaired.fastq.gz data/qc/{}_O2_unpaired.fastq.gz \; -p 8 \; --validateMappings \; --fldMean 265 \; --fldSD 105 \; --useVBOpt \; --seqBias \; -o data/mapped_salmon/SE/{}_quant &; ```; But I wasn't sure if the outputs can be directly combined by addition.

Availability,"Hi Salmon team. Are there plans afoot to support quantification of scRNA-seq data with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs)? UMIs are very commonly used in scRNA-seq data now, and correct quantification requires ""de-duplication"" of the reads so that each UMI is only counted once for expression quantification. Doing this is not entirely trivial, as a quick survey of tools available shows (e.g. [UMI-tools](https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools), [umitools](https://github.com/brwnj/umitools), [umis](https://github.com/vals/umis), [umi](https://github.com/aryeelab/umi/wiki)). . Nevertheless, it would be _very_ convenient for those Salmon fans amongst us dealing with scRNA-seq data to be able to process scRNA-seq data with UMIs directly with Salmon. Selfishly, this would be awesome for the Salmon integration with the scater package (now fully implemented). . Not to make a thing of it, but kallisto is now providing some support for UMI quantification (https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/singlecell.html) ;P.

Availability,"Hi Victor,. Is it the case that `/n/data1/cores/bcbio/ej_rnaseq/tCells_KO/work/spikein/Flox5YFP0_B07_R/index` is an index of only your genes of interest? If so, that would explain what you're seeing. Salmon assumes that some non-zero fraction of reads map in your sample. In this case, I'd presume that if you have some samples where no reads map to any transcript of your gene of interest, then salmon will complain in exactly the manner mentioned above. Now that I think about it, there are actually two different scenarios that can cause the above. The first is if something goes wrong in the optimization (there should be no way for this to happen, and so it would be the result of a bug if it did). The second is actually if there are no mappable reads. That's not the result of a bug, or even an ""error"" per-se, but just very unexpected input (since, in a typical scenario, this would imply the reads are unmatched with the reference). It might make sense to handle this case separately. However, this is certainly what is causing the output in your case, and you can safely assume that here, were it not for this specific check, Salmon would return an estimated count of 0 for all transcripts in the index.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/119#issuecomment-278743839:803,error,error,803,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/119#issuecomment-278743839,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"Hi everyone,. Is there a way to feed pre-transformed files into Alevin?

For example, for 10x v2:; ```json; {; ""read1"": ""(?P<name>@.*) .*\\n(?P<CB>.{16})(?P<MB>.{10})(.*)\\n\\+(.*)\\n(.*)\\n"",; ""read2"": ""(@.*) .*\\n(?P<seq>.*)\\n\\+(.*)\\n(?P<qual>.*)\\n"",; ""read3"": ""(@.*)\\n(?P<SB>.*)\\n\\+(.*)\\n(.*)\\n""; }; ```; This makes it so end users can write their own transformations to handle arbitrary protocols. .

Availability,"Hi salmon team,. Thank you for developing this useful tool! I used salmon (v1.9.0) to quantify transcript abundance using full-length cDNA reads (ONT) after mapping with minimap2 to a transcriptome (Ensembl, GRCh38.p13). The commands as follows:. ```; minimap2 -t 4 -ax map-ont -N 100 -p 0.99 Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.mmi sample_full_length.fa | samtools view -bS > sample_cdna.bam; salmon quant -p 4 --ont -l U -t Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa -a sample_cdna.bam -o salmon_quant -g TranscriptID_GeneID_from_cDNA_fasta.tsv; ```. I found that salmon with the ""--ont"" option has a tendency to assign reads to isoforms containing longer exons (especially at the 5' end), even if regions specific to the longer exons have no read coverage. In the following example, the expression abundance of TPI1-202 is obviously higher than TPI1-201 based on genome mapping coverage in IGV tools. <img width=""415"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33354198/191897914-cb68c719-3971-4489-b970-5f2322d878aa.png"">. However, in salmon (with “--ont”) results, the average detected transcript abundance for TPI1-202, TPI1-201 and TPI1-210 were 84.339, 186.753 and 132.503 respectively, i.e., the abundance of TPI1-202 was much lower than TPI1-201. Salmon seems to overestimate the abundance of TPI1-201 and TPI1-210 which contain longer exons at the 5' end. Similar problems were also observed in many other genes. Meanwhile, using the “--noErrorModel” option instead of “--ont” does not show this behavior (but “--noErrorModel” has problematic quantifications in other cases). Could you help with this problem? Is there any specific considerations in the “--ont” mode that could explain this behavior, and how can I fix it?. Thanks in advance!.

Availability,"Hi!. I'm trying to tidy up some of the strandedness analysis in nf-core/rnaseq, and have gone down the rabbit hole a little bit, hoping you can shortcut things for me. . nf-core/rnaseq's test profile runs Salmon on subsampled FASTQ files and uses Salmon to infer the strandedness, by extracting the `library_types` from a meta_info.json. . In an example run (~50k reads) this is unstranded (`IU`), but I'm having trouble reconciling with what I see in the corresponding `lib_format_counts.json`:. ```; {; ""read_files"": ""[ WT_REP2.subsampled_R1.fastq.gz, WT_REP2.subsampled_R2.fastq.gz]"",; ""expected_format"": ""IU"",; ""compatible_fragment_ratio"": 1.0,; ""num_compatible_fragments"": 39909,; ""num_assigned_fragments"": 39909,; ""num_frags_with_concordant_consistent_mappings"": 41509,; ""num_frags_with_inconsistent_or_orphan_mappings"": 3363,; ""strand_mapping_bias"": 0.11922715555662628,; ""MSF"": 0,; ""OSF"": 0,; ""ISF"": 4949,; ""MSR"": 0,; ""OSR"": 0,; ""ISR"": 36560,; ""SF"": 1754,; ""SR"": 1609,; ""MU"": 0,; ""OU"": 0,; ""IU"": 0,; ""U"": 0; }; ```. Is it possible for me to do my own inference of `IU` from those numbers, or does it happen elsewhere?

Availability,"Hi, I had previousl tried using the `--whitelist` option using the 10x barcode whitelist (they're available at `cellranger-2.0.0/cellranger-cs/2.0.0/tenkit/lib/python/tenkit/barcodes/737K-august-2016.txt` and `4M-with-alts-february-2016.txt`). This had the same output as not using them. I just reran alevin with the `--dumpFeatures` flag, attached are the barcodes. I forgot to mention that with cellranger we saw that the knee was very soft, there was no sharp drop, and that might be what's confusing salmon. I had looked at the documentation but did not see a way to manually specify the cutoff. It is also desirable to manually the first few barcodes, because those have abnormally more counts than would be expected. Here's a log-log histogram of the alevin frequency output; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12504176/42296042-b9a944c6-7fa5-11e8-9f33-02a178d249ce.png).

Availability,"Hi, I have been trying to follow [this tutorial](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2020/alevin-spatial/) but have run into a problem where Seurat appears to think I am trying to add new cells when I believe I am trying to add an assay. Here is the relevant code section and the error I receive:; ```; DefaultAssay(object = image.data) <- ""Spatial""; brain[['slice']] <- image.data; Error in `[[<-`:; !

I checked that Seurat has not changed the `sobj[[""ASSAYNAME""]] <- MYASSAYOBJECT` syntax in the same R session by following [this tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/multimodal_vignette) up to the line where the `adt` assay is added and confirmed that the resulting object had two assays present. I think this may be a versioning issue related to what types of objects can be added into layers (aka slots) in a Seurat object. For reference, here are some details of the objects involved:; ```; > class(brain); [1] ""Seurat""; attr(,""package""); [1] ""SeuratObject""; > class(image.data); [1] ""VisiumV2""; attr(,""package""); [1] ""Seurat""; ```. It is worth noting that I installed Salmon using the docker image found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/combinelab/salmon) approximately three months ago. The version number I see is `1.10.3`. Below is my sessionInfo output as well. My best guess is that I have to adjust the object type for `image.data` here to something that can be coerced into a slot in the `brain` Seurat object, but I am not sure what object that should be.

Considering that the barcodes in the latter case are also found in the whitelist file. . My second question is more about difference between alevin and cellranger.

If I use the V3 barcode list, then I _don't_ get an error message. However, I got more discordant cell counts between CellRanger and STARsolo. The Kallisto cell barcode recovery rate was also low (<10%). So, I thought there error was that different cell barcodes should be used for this sample. I think that matches, what I saw on this FAQ page from 10x Genomics:. https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004506263-What-is-a-barcode-whitelist-. So, I downloaded the [737k-august-2016.txt](https://github.com/10XGenomics/cellranger/blob/master/lib/python/cellranger/barcodes/737K-august-2016.txt) file from 10x, and I am testing using that.

I have the problem that salmon quant exits with a segfault when more than one BAM file is provided. ; If the BAM files are provided one at a time, no error or segfault happens and salmon wickedly fast quantificates the transcripts. The first used BAM files where shuffled (with samtools bamshuf) as recommended in the docs. To exclude an error on my side I did:; - try unshuffled BAM files --> Segfault; - try older Salmon Version (7.2) --> Segfault; - build Salmon from source --> Segfault; - use different transcriptdata (see below) --> Segfault. The segfault happens after all reads (in all files) are processed:; `processed 48000000 reads in current roundSegmentation fault`. ### Example workflow:.

Thus, clang is failing to find the basic c++ library includes that it needs.

Availability,"Hi,. first of all, I really like using Salmon for RNAseq quantification. I have a very special problem. We are working with experimental conditions in which transposons get activated and highly expressed. This initially caused my RNAseq quantification to be wrong as transposon reads got assigned to genic transcripts. I can circumvent this problem mostly by adding the transposon transcripts into the index.; Still there are some regions that are 1:1 identical between transposons and genes that still cause problems. The gene in the examples is not expressed in the cells I use which is more or less what Salmon gives me for WT conditions. Still I get TPMs of >12 in my experimental conditions due to the heavy transposon deregulation. You can see this here in this chart where I overlay the mappings from salmon in WT and in the experimental knockout (KO):; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12491961/39418440-bfbca0f2-4c5a-11e8-8bde-f2da0cca2658.png).

I noticed that these are not explicitly linked to anymore on the page `https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases`, although these still are available through [this link](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/files/2099291/salmon-latest_linux_x86_64.tar.gz) that is regularly posted on this Github 'forum'. Please note that I learned you favor the Bioconda route for keeping Salmon up to date. Nevertheless, provided it doesn't take too much effort, I would appreciate it very much if you could still make the binaries available. - My 2nd question has to do with some basic QC-ing: I am currently analyzing a set of 96 mouse samples. While running Salmon, I noticed most samples do have a nice percentage of mapped reads (>80%), but I also noticed that for samples this percentage was much lower (<50%).; Q: Is there an easy way of obtaining these numbers (""percent_mapped"") for all samples that were mapped in a Salmon run (without manually reviewing all 96 samples the 'meta_info.json' file)? In other words, how to obtain an 'overall log file'?.

Availability,"Hi,; I was skimming through some of the code and other open issues on support for other library (cell barcode/umi) designs. It looks like there is code for supporting inDrop libraries, but I wasn't sure which parameters I'd need to set. I have inDrop v2 libraries that I'd like to process and am just trying to figure out if we'll need to write our own extensions or if there is already code in place that we can test. Related to some of the comments about the best model for UMI correction in #269 ; The inDrop (at least the v2 protocol) is based on the CEL-Seq like chemistry -- which uses (in vitro transcription) IVT for the initial amplification rather than PCR. From what I've seen so far, the 2 main flavors of single cell RNA-Seq library construction chemistry are; 1. CelSeq/inDrop; polyA capture -> Reverse transcription (RT) for 1st strand cDNA synthesis -> 2nd strand synthesis -> IVT (linear) amplification -> fragmentation -> RT again to convert back to cDNA -> final PCR to amplify library and add Illumina adapters. 2. DropSeq/10X; polyA capture -> RT with template switching -> PCR amplification of cDNA -> fragmentation followed by variable library construction (either transposon/Nextera based or more traditional --frag, end repair, a-tail and adapter ligation) -> final PCR to amplify library and add Illumina adapters.

Availability,"Hi,; would you mind cleaning up the STDOUT and STDERR output from `salmon quant` and `salmon index`? Commonly `STDOUT` should be used for normal output messages and `STDERR` for errors or at worst warnings. Salmon writes most of the messages to `STDERR`. 1. `Version Info: This is the most recent version of Salmon.` is output to `STDOUT`. I find it useless. If salmon run some network connection to figure out its version it is `a)` prone to errors, `b)` I would expect a fat warning in the documentation a `phone home` feature is builtin, `c)` it is likely to fail on more network-restricted installations. Or, `d)`, the message is incorrect. I suggest drop the message altogether. 2. `salmon quant` writes a lot of normal messages to `STDERR`. Please use `STDOUT` instead. If a program exits with a non-zero exit code it is common to read its `STDERR` output to learn what was the cause for the error. It is awkward to realize there is lots of unrelated text. Please follow common rules on Unix. 3. The docs at http://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html did not mention the `fmd` index is just a plain index from `bwa`. Why don't you instruct users to use `bwa index` instead? It would be clearer (if that is the type of index you employ). 4. `salmon index` behavior. ```; salmon index -t Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa -i Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all --type quasi -k 31; index [""Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all""] did not previously exist . . . creating it; [2018-06-25 19:25:57.122] [jLog] [info] building index; RapMap Indexer.

Availability,"Hi:; Recently, I learned to use salmon in our lncRNA research project. I am confused in a point. ; As shown in the documentation (https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html), according to our understanding, if we want those incompatible mappings will be discarded, the incompatPrior should be set as 0.0. And our RNA-Seq library type is dUTP based strand-specific RNA-Seq, so we should use ISR. ; But I am confused with https://gitter.im/COMBINE-lab/salmon?at=594a76d402c480e67268f02b and https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/116; we want the expression level of antisense. Since there are about 0.5~1% reads can be the wrong reads mapped to the reverse strand of the gene (dUTP stranded protocol, the strand error (i.e. % of reads sequenced from the wrong strand of the RNA) is typically 0.5-1%). Can we use the incompatPrior option and get the expression level of antisense(right) in a single run?; This is our command line `salmon quant -i Ath_TX.index -l ISR -1 test_R1.fq.gz -2 test_R2.fq.gz -o TEST_TX_QUANT --incompatPrior 0.0 --seqBias --gcBias --threads 20`.; That those wrong mapped alignments (they didn't follow the ISR fule, maybe the error from the error of process of library construction) will be discarded.; Thank you and all the best.; Linhua",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/182:726,error,error,726,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/182,3,['error'],['error']

Availability,"I am assuming what you are looking for is the ""effective lengths"" of the transcripts i.e. not just the original transcript lengths but instead corrected based on the quantification model.

Availability,"I am interested in using Alevin to quantify some single nucleus RNA-seq data but am wondering what the best approach would be to get Alevin to appropriately handle the significant number of intronic reads. Issue #450 raised a similar question in the context of RNA velocity estimation, but it failed to address the appropriate approach if you are only interested in gene counts rather than distinguishing between intronic vs exonic counts. So, I am wondering if there are any recommendations on the best way to approach this issue. I imagine this mostly comes down to index generation, but am not sure what approach is best. After reading the [preprint on RNA velocity](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990069v1.full#T1) the approach that immediately comes to mind would be to make an index including both fully-spliced and fully-unprocessed copies of each transcript. . I am somewhat concerned, however, how this might affect the UMI handling algorithm, especially since everything purely exonic would now multi-map while intronic reads would tend to be considered unique. I could see some cases where you end up getting over-counting due to inappropriately splitting UMIs, especially with transcripts that have a mix of splicing and intron retention (eg two short spliced exons + intron 2).",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/586:560,down,down,560,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/586,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"I am trying to quantify these data at the transcript level which is why the number of features is this big.

I realized I forgot to update the path to the run.sh script when calling the 0.12.0 binary (I updated the path to the binary but no to the script). When running the wrapper in the 0.12.0 folder I could succesfully run alevin on the CD14 dataset, with or without the --forceCells 4000 flag. I tried to run alevin-0.12.0 on the PBMC 3k dataset but I got the same error. I am now trying to run it on all the FACS-sorted samples and I will see how that goes. I feel this is happening slightly inconsistently (although very frequently). Notably, it either happens after `Clearing EqMap; Might take some time.` or `Starting Import of the gene count matrix of size 5344x167268.`. I have had it happen once in the middle of the `Analyzed xxx cells (yy% of all)` phase.

The solution:; 1. Delete the salmon folder and download a fresh one from github; 2. sudo apt update (this step is very important, to update the packages to be above version 2018) ; 3. sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev; 4.

Availability,"I see, we might have to tweak a bit based on the use case for `longranger basic`.; In `v0.10`, alevin should still be able to do CB correction, and attach the corrected CBs to the header of the second file, although the remaining template sequence (128 bases) from the first file might get loss, since `cellranger` was using template sequencing in only one file. Like @rob-p was saying we can work on making this step more generalized, once we confirm that the error-correction model for `cellranger` and `longranger` can be used interchangeably. In theory we can still concatenate the remaining 128 bases into an interleaved format since alevin has hidden options to provide the lengths explicitly but we have not tested this feature extensively. We will keep this at the top of our feature-request list and would inform you as soon as we have a stable version with this feature. Thanks again for the interest !!. re: *interleaved format* -- indeed an interleave format does makes sense and should be the default dumping format, but I believe since the default mode of 10x's `mkfastq` is to dump separate `FASTQ`, we should not use resources to create an interim interleaved format and then consume it downstream (since`FASTQ` itself is not very efficient), instead, in alevin we just consume the two separate `FASTQ` into our own interim data-structure to perform the downstream analysis.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/233#issuecomment-395195411:461,error,error-correction,461,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/233#issuecomment-395195411,3,"['down', 'error']","['downstream', 'error-correction']"

That may not impact most downstream applications of the data but it does limit some. I'd be particularly interested in using reads that have been aligned and assigned to transcripts with an EM algorithm to investigate RNA editing. The most advanced methods of doing this integrate the quality of base calls from the sequencer into the models and, as such, cannot currently run on the data output. Although it may save a few CPU cycles in not reading and outputting the qualities - I can understand the choice when running with default settings - when running with `--writeMappings` that nominal difference in speed needs to be weighed up against downstream utility.

Availability,"I was attempting to create an index for mapping of transcripts using the full chicken (Gallus gallus) genome from Ensembl. No errors appeared, but the ref_indexing.log stated ""Replaced 9,788,221 non-ATCG nucleotides"" which seems rather high compared to some of the numbers I've seen from gencode-derived indices. This is my first time making an index, so I don't know where to begin troubleshooting. What ""non-ATCG nucleotides"" are being replaced here, and what are they being replaced with? Could Salmon be reading metadata in transcript headers as nucleotide sequences? Why would it do that? Am I just being paranoid?. Here's my code.

Availability,"I wonder if the max 1-edit distance restriction is too stringent for 21 length barcodes. One important flag to play with is the `--minScoreFraction`.

For k=1, we had `edit_cost = 8` leading to automatic setting of `minScoreFraction` of 0.797619.; we have looked at 15 length barcodes, but it's possible longer barcodes might have more sequencing error.

Availability,"I'm trying to process the 10X 1.3 Million Brain Cells from E18 Mice dataset using Alevin with compiled salmon version 0.12.0 using the gencode.vM19.pc_transcripts.fa.gz as reference (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/1.3.0/1M_neurons). The chemistry used is the 10x-v2. I have divided the fastqs into the 133 libraries and I'm trying to run Alevin per library fastqs (~140 r1 fastqs per library). The dataset has been processed with the longranger demux program, which outputs one fastq with both the UMI+barcode and read-sequence. I have divided the fastqs so that it corresponds to the input of Alevin (i.e. the UMI+barcode in one fastq and the read-sequence in the other). However it seems that Alevin gets stuck on processing the barcodes, no error code is produced it just doesn't seem to do anything anymore with just ""processed X Million barcodes"" printed on the screen. Are you aware of such a problem with many fastq files or is there something that I'm not taking into account? Is there a limit how many files can be used as an input? I tested Alevin with 60 fastqs (120 in total r1+r2 fastqs) and it ran through but with more than 60 fastqs it seems to get stuck on processing the barcodes. If it is not possible to run all the library related fastqs, do you recommend running them in smaller batches and then combining the resulting count matrices?.

Availability,"I've found at least ~100 instances of identical RefSeq IDs that appear on more than one chromosome in the human genome reference. These are a mix of (I'm guessing) chrX/Y homologous genes, miRs, snoRNAs, and other long/short noncoding RNAs. This issue will also apply to genes appearing in genomic regions with sequence from multiple haplotypes (e.g. chr6_qbl_hap6, etc) since those also have identical RefSeq IDs. This is certainly bad practice for annotation purposes, but the consequence is that STAR effectively lumps the duplicates into one transcript model (e.g. 3 appearances of 68 bp miR means STAR annotates as one 204 bp gene), and salmon then finds a discrepancy during error modeling between the annotated and ""STAR-observed"" gene lengths, throwing a fatal error. One fix of course would be to remove duplicated sequences from the gene annotation prior to alignment with STAR, [or to have STAR deal with duplicated sequences differently](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/issues/482), but it might be nice to have some sort of check in place downstream as well to avoid failure.",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/282:681,error,error,681,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/282,4,"['down', 'error', 'failure']","['downstream', 'error', 'failure']"

Availability,"In my experience it is normal to get a **much lower** transcriptome mapping rate for rRNA-depleted samples vs polyA-selected samples. . I'm getting ~21% mapping rate (using Gencode 41 transcripts) on human brain RNAseq samples sequenced several years ago using rRNA-depletion protocol (older Illumina Ribo Zero kits).; I was initially shocked (being used to seeing >90% mapping rates from HISAT2/STAR for these samples) but it turns out **this is normal** for this kind of samples, in this context.; HISAT2 reports 96% mapping rate on the same samples, but QC metrics (rnaseqc) for these HISAT2 alignments (using the same Gencode annotation) show a **65% intronic rate** and a **%23.5 exonic rate** (the rest being intergenic etc). So the _exonic rate_ is getting close to what Salmon is showing (and what it measures), thus I suppose it makes sense to see such a low mapping rate for Salmon on these samples.; (kallisto also reports ~21% pseudoaligned percentage on the same samples). I am only a bit disappointed that when I use `--validateMappings` with decoy sequences (whole genome) added, the mapping rate goes down to about **16.7%** -- as some reads map better to the decoys in that case (partially intronic reads etc.), but I also see a `higher number of fragments entirely discarded because of alignment score` (higher `num_fragments_filtered_vm` and much higher `num_alignments_below_threshold_for_mapped_fragments_vm`).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/779#issuecomment-1474291747:1117,down,down,1117,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/779#issuecomment-1474291747,1,['down'],['down']

One other option is to use --keepCBfraction it takes a number in (0, 1] , which basically tells Alevin to use X fraction of CB from the total observed.

Availability,"MI count **but** I had to bring that part into the discussion as it was mentioned that you wanted to compare different deduplication strategies. I think your suggestion makes sense and mostly aligns with the definition being used by 10x [here](https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003646912-How-is-sequencing-saturation-calculated-). Although note they have changed the definition with the new version of the software. Anyhow, the *short answer* to the question of how can we generate that in Alevin environment is -- by post processing the dumpFeatures output of the Alevin run. _long answer_: The difference lies in the term deduplication and the strategy used to perform it. Basically the fundamental unit for deduplication in 10x as mentioned in the link above is a tuple of `(valid cell-barcode, valid UMI, gene) `, while that's not exactly true for us. We can certainly generate it but it does not aligns with the theory of Alevin's deduplication Algorithm. Having said that, I also like your idea of using:; > the gene quantifications from (de)duplicated UMIs, gene quantifications from unique UMIs, using them to have an idea of the amount/ratio of redundant information. However, the above definition reflect more of the duplication rate (at least in terms of the definition defined in *Alevin* manuscript [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/01/335000)) than sequence saturation. **NOTE** the quoted definition was actually the 10x definition of sequence saturation too before it was changed, at least in my understanding. If you need the deduplication rate of each cell you can get that by using `--dumpFeature` flag in the Alevin run and look for file `featureDump.txt`. There will be a dump of multiple features w/ each CB but the second (starting from 0) column of the file gives you the duplication rate of each CB. Hope that helps, I totally understand your suggestion and would like to include @rob-p into this too if he has more comments/insights on this.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/267#issuecomment-414784626:1344,redundant,redundant,1344,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/267#issuecomment-414784626,1,['redundant'],['redundant']

Availability,"Ok, I figured it out :) — these two *decoy* references are (1) identical with each other and (2) collide with *another* decoy reference. Currently, the way we process decoys, we don't allow duplicate decoys (it makes even less sense to allow duplicate decoys than to allow duplicate transcripts). However, the reason indexing worked with `k=17` is not because of `k` but because of the `--keepDuplicates` flag. With that flag, these decoys get added. I think the right thing for us to do on our part is to remove duplicate *decoys* if they appear in the reference and the user has not passed `--keepDuplicates`. . However, for the time being, I think the best thing to do is simply to remove `AABR07022993.1` and `AABR07023006.1` from the `toplevel` file and from `decoys.txt`, since the sequence they contain is already represented in the decoy part of the index.

This also allowed quantification (with bias correction) to run to completion. @mikelove, can you validate that this fixes things on your end? If so, perhaps @tomsing1 could also validate that this is the same root cause of the issue for him?

Availability,"Oki, so I have updated a couple of things in the latest commit on the develop branch, which should make the things more streamlined. . * `maxNumBarcodes`: As you have initially used `maxNumBarcodes` which is by default set to 100k it means. by default alevin quantifies 100k CBs which includes both the low and high confidence CB count. You can change this number accordingly to set the universe of the top CB to quantify.; * `KeepCBFraction` : It defines what fraction of `maxNumBarcodes` to be used as the high confidence barcodes and should definitely generate the quants for. If set to 1 then everything is high confidence and the whitelisting cannot be performed. Thanks to this issue, alevin will not fail without error when there is no low confidence CB is found instead it checks if the number of low confidence CB is less than `lowRegionMinBarcodes` (default to 200), alevin will warn and not perform the whitelisting.; * `freqThreshold`: This is used to filter out most obvious cases to filter out CB with frequency less than set by the parameter (default to 10).

The only challenge is in making the comparison apples-to-apples (i.e. enabling multi-threaded parsing in seqtk with minimal overhead ??? a concurrent queue is cheap, but not free). . Other points worth considering:; - there's a runtime overhead to constantly changing sequencing formats. Some; programs want split, others want interleaved. We've settled on interleaved; because it enables streaming, which is a major win (2-4x performance); and; also because having one file is better than having 2 or 4.; - the management overhead to keeping track of many files is less for experts,; but is pretty significant for beginners.

I think the confusion is you are thinking of the concept of Selective Alignment as the same as aligning to transcriptome w/ decoys (can be genome or mashmap based). Although they are related methods but the concept of Selective Alignment predates the idea of decoy based alignment, checkout [this](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3233589) paper from our lab where we discuss how Selectively Aligning difficult reads to just the transcriptome itself can result in improved quantification estimates compared to quasi or pseduo alignment. To summarize: ; In version 1.0; A) SA: The mashmap and bedtools based pipeline which follows old SalmonTools based pipeline.; B) SAF: Inbuilt salmon pipeline to consume genome and follows this pipeline.; C) If you don't provide any decoys, salmon will do Selective Alignment just on the transcriptome. The Release notes you quoted just means you cannot disable this feature i.e. you cannot fall back to quasi-mapping (in quasi mapping there is no alignment of the reads at all). In version 0.15.0; You cannot provide decoys and the transcriptome based mapping performed in this version would be quasi-mapping i.e. no Alignment of reads.

Availability,"Salmon version: 0.13.1 (installed via pre-compiled binary). I used salmon to quantify some samples and wanted to use the `quantmerge` command to produce a combined table. However, the merged table I got as output only contained 17 lines (of 52228 in the quant.genes.sf files). I was able to identify that the problem was related somehow to the ""Name"" column itself, although I didn't find any obvious pattern for failure. For example, if I rename all the genes to simply ""1"", ""2"", ... and then `quantmerge`, I get a properly combined table with all samples/genes. Looking back at the ""original"" data with the gene names, I find that the truncated merged table consistently/always truncates immediately *after* processing some gene names. For example, the 16th gene name in my ""quant.genes.sf"" table happens to be ""Erdr1"". If this line is moved to the top of that file, then the merged table will truncate at 2 (the header counting for one of those, obviously). Unfortunately, it's not just ""Erdr1"". If that line is moved to the end of the file, or deleted entirely, there is another failure at gene ""Gm28674"", which happens to be the 19th gene. And so on for a very large number of names (I gave up after removing ~30 one at a time). I've now tested with a few different samples and with a number of randomly selected subsets of the original quant files and the behavior is consistent. I can't figure out what the pattern is, but ""Erdr1"", ""Gm28674"", and all the other genes I discovered with my ad-hoc process above, always cause `quantmerge` to truncate the output.",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/356:413,failure,failure,413,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/356,2,['failure'],['failure']

Availability,"So I got the data and am trying to repro the issue now (thanks!). Quick question. I noticed in your example command you have `--libType ISF`. However, you have single-end reads, so the appropriate library type would be `SF` (i.e., they can't be ""inward"" facing reads, b/c there is no mate for each read). When I run your command as is, but replace `ISF` as `SF`, my run completes successfully, and I don't get any `errorminEQClassWeight` output. Could you let me know if this makes any difference for you (also, sorry that, apparently, we're not outputting a useful error message when one passes in a paired-end library type with single-end data). edit: Actually, it's even stranger. I noticed that in your command the library type comes *after* the reads to which it refers, but in this case, Salmon will not apply that library type to those reads (which explains why you're not getting a warning message). The restriction that the `--libType` flag comes before the reads it describes is buried in [the docs](http://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html#using-salmon), but I definitely need to make that clearer. Anyway, the point is that, in this case, Salmon should apply the ""default"" single-end library type (i.e., `U`) to your reads. So, presumably, that was what was happening when you saw the strange behavior during Gibbs sampling (and is also what was happening when my Gibbs sampling run completed successfully).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/111#issuecomment-266927204:415,error,errorminEQClassWeight,415,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/111#issuecomment-266927204,4,['error'],"['error', 'errorminEQClassWeight']"

Availability,"Sorry if I wasn't clear. Also, maybe I am trying to bluntly transpose a; metric that comes from alignment-based quantification.

To be more precise, I am not sure to see how it; could be a problem in this computation. But I am probably missing an; important point?. The idea of quasi-mapping as I understand is identifying the transcripts; from which the reads could have originated, generating a quantification.; For the sequencing saturation, we don't really need to know where the; read align on the transcript sequence, we just want to know that the; read comes from one single transcript, a unique UMI. So if I am right,; it is possible to summarize this quantification at the level of UMIs,; and have an idea of the duplication level of the transcripts that have; been tagged with UMIs. From what I understand, this is where alevin; perform the deduplication computation to have a correct idea of the; transcript amount when UMI are added, prior amplifications resulting; from the RT/PCR steps. So I was imagining it could be possible to take the gene quantifications; from (de)duplicated UMIs, gene quantifications from unique UMIs, using; them to have an idea of the amount/ratio of redundant information in the; sequencing data, producing a metric very similar to the seq sat from the; 10x definition.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/267#issuecomment-414331344:1449,redundant,redundant,1449,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/267#issuecomment-414331344,2,['redundant'],['redundant']

Availability,"Thanks @Gaura! Sounds promising. . Can you clarify what differences you saw between v1/v2 protocols? My understanding was that the only changes were slight differences in barcode positions within the barcode read, ie something that could be handled with different `bc-geometry`, but maybe that's all you meant in terms of differing implementations. Regarding the BC1 and how it could be two sequences for the same sample - this is confusing to explain in text format, but all comes down to the sequential nature of how the cells acquire barcodes in this protocol. We start with a 96-well plate, where each of the top 48 wells contain BOTH an oligo-dT barcode and random hexamer barcode. The samples then get added to each well. Biochemistry happens. Then you pool all the cells together, split them back out into 48 wells again, and each well gets its own BC2. Then repeat for BC3. . So a given transcript may get amplified via one of two amplification primers (oligo-dT or random hexamer), but after that, will get a single BC2 sequence and BC3 sequence added after that. In Fig 1A of the Rosenberg paper, it's as though there isn't _just_ an orange sequence carrying out reverse transcription, there are actually two different (known) sequences associated with different routes of amplification per cell. . The net effect is that a given cell can contain transcripts that have a sequence like this:; AACGTGAT-CTGTAGCC-ACACAGAA. or like this:; GATAGACA-CTGTAGCC-ACACAGAA. where maybe the first sequence was amplified by oligo-dT and the second was amplified via a random hexamer. Because they have the same BC2 and BC3 sequence, and the BC1 sequences match a known pairing, we know they come from the same cell and therefore the data should be merged. . Any lab running these experiments will have a table of known pairings (ie the two barcodes added to each of first 48 wells), so that they can be merged and treated as though they came from the same cell. This can either be handled upstream of sal",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-937918722:482,down,down,482,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-937918722,2,['down'],['down']

Availability,"Thanks @Ryan-Zhu ,. A couple of thoughts.; To me the data seem a little noisy as a lot of CB/reads are thrown away due to ""knee"" thresholding.; Check https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/362 if you wanna play with how to customize alevin for user-define whitelisting. Having said that this is how you can parse the data from alevin.; Alevin use 1277 CB after its knee thresholding + 638 low confidence Barcode for downstream whitelisting = total 1915 CBs.; If you check the warning in the log it says :. ```; [2019-06-12 15:07:08.152] [alevinLog] [warning] Skipped 313 barcodes due to No mapped read; ```; Basically it means out of 1915, 313 didn't had any read mapped to them, so alevin doesn't report them in the output matrix. Alevin reports 1915 - 313 = 1602 CBs both in `.mtx` and `quants_mat.gz` file. You can check the order of the CB in the `quants_mat_rows.txt` file, which has 1602 rows/CBs. If you don't provide alevin with external whitelist alevin tries to do post whitelisting of it's own. Basically out of the 1277 high confidence CBs alevin initially find out through knee it assigns 647 CBs as final whitelisted CB as found in the `whitelist.txt` file. If you wan't to subsample these CBs you have to extract the information from the `.mtx` or `quants_mat.gz` file.

Availability,"Thanks @juugii for the detailed response and clarifying my doubts.; It surely is possible to lose some information when projecting the data on lower dimensional space since none of the methods, CCA and MNN, are lossless. I do see your point and would like to understand more about the depth normalization problem you are facing with different experiments. . I tried to search the algorithm used by cellranger to aggregate the counts and it looks like the following:; * As I was saying earlier aggregation step was happening downstream of count/quantification of the gene count matrix, at least in cellranger pipeline.; > When doing large studies involving multiple biological samples (or multiple libraries or replicates of the same sample), it is best to run cellranger count on each of the libraries individually, and then pool the results using cellranger aggr. * It looks like they have three different modes to normalize the libraries; > There are three normalization modes:; mapped: (default) Subsample reads from higher-depth libraries until they all have an equal number of confidently mapped reads per cell.; raw: Subsample reads from higher-depth libraries until they all have an equal number of total (i.e. raw, mapping-independent) reads per cell.; none: Do not normalize at all. * Although it's not clear, what do they mean by `equal number of confidently mapped reads per cell`, does it mean median reads per cell ? Like you tried to show in the above plot the distribution can be very uneven. But the part that troubles me more is once `count` information has been generated it has lost the read level information, since we have deduplicated them, then how do they use the read counts to normalize.

The issue we have is that we're trying to run a pipeline in a fairly high-throughput manner to get a sensible 'enough' matrix without too much manual intervention. So I'm trying to avoid anything that requires an eyeballing step, accepting that the matrix we get will be less optimal than one you'd get from manual optimisation. Where possible, our curators are extracting the expected cell numbers from publications, so sometimes I have at least a general idea of where to look for an elbow/ feature. @roryk - have you used your alternate view on the data to automatically derive cutoffs?

Asking since you people are the pioneers in this aspect of problem solving.; I have to determine the expression of GFP and Transposon sequence in the transcriptome.; I read the material posted on the link https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html.; It instructs this to be done in 2 different ways-; There are two options for generating a decoy-aware transcriptome:. The first is to compute a set of decoy sequences by mapping the annotated transcripts you wish to index against a hard-masked version of the organism’s genome. This can be done with e.g. MashMap2, and we provide some simple scripts to greatly simplify this whole process. Specifically, you can use the generateDecoyTranscriptome.sh script, whose instructions you can find in this README. The second is to use the entire genome of the organism as the decoy sequence. This can be done by concatenating the genome to the end of the transcriptome you want to index and populating the decoys.txt file with the chromosome names. Detailed instructions on how to prepare this type of decoy sequence is available here. This scheme provides a more comprehensive set of decoys, but, obviously, requires considerably more memory to build the index. I tried the 2nd approach. Combined the GFP,Transposon and the genome FASTA files, indexed it , constructed the decoy according to the given instructions given here https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2019/selective-alignment/.; When I ran Salmon (version 1.2.1_linux_x86_64) it did not report anything in the quant files (I know that these samples have high GFP and Transposon expression in these samples).

Just wanted to confirm what the intended usage is as, for e.g. [scPipe](https://github.com/LuyiTian/scPipe) uses all mitochondrial genes in `calculate_QC_metrics` (whether from nuclear or mitchondrial DNA). I am guessing that since the model for alevin is using the fraction of mitochondrial reads, the `--mrna` file should include only mtDNA (from mitochondrial genome) genes. It seems to be the case that nuclear mitochondrial genes are both up- and down-regulated with damage (**C**: *mtDNA*, *Mitochondria up*, *Mitochondria down* in figure below):.

Availability,"Thanks for the detailed report @idinsmore1,. These are quite different versions of ensembl, and so changes in the underlying transcriptome can absolutely have an effect on estimated abundances. Specifically, as the newer releases of ensemble tend to annotate more and more isoforms, there are more potential explanations for the reads. Reads that may have been previously assigned to an isoform in the old annotation may better match to a new isoform in the new annotation, etc. This will affect the read assignment and TPM both to the isoform to which the reads were originally being assigned and the new isoform to which the reads are now being assigned. . One thing to look at would be to see how much things change at the gene level, where we'd expect mapping uncertainty to be much lower. Once there's an idea of the types of things that are changing, it will be possible to drill down a bit more to try and figure out exactly what's going on.

Availability,"Thanks for the feedback!. I tried playing with the vbPrior setting and observed that, as you noted, higher increases of the vbPrior tended to flatten out the read apportionment, such that as the vbPrior increased the two transcripts became increasingly similar in their final expression (presumably they would eventually hit 50/50). It's good to know how that settings affects my data, but this is not quite what I was hoping for... . Ideally, the short transcript would get nearly *all* of the reads, rather than splitting the reads 50/50 or, with the default settings, giving nearly all the reads to the longer transcript. I realized that, as a human, the reason the short transcript is obviously the dominant one is how the reads pileup in the alignment. There are hundreds of reads mapping to both transcripts, but NO reads map to the 5' of the long transcript. As I understand the selective alignment, the alignment scores are passed to the quantification step, but the *position* of the reads is not used downstream. In order to pass my human intuition along here, the software would need to pay attention to the coverage bias of the reads mapping to the transcripts and assign a penalty when two otherwise identical transcripts have a different coverage variance across the transcript. This sounds like what the --posBias flag should incorporate into the effective lengths, but it doesn't have much effect on these transcripts for me (FYI, I am getting a segfault when I run only --posBias in the current salmon version, but if I run all the models together like --gcBias --seqBias --posBias, it completes fine). . Also, my intuition for these transcripts is not really a coverage ""bias"" as much as the read depth absolutely plummeting at the 5' end of the long transcript. It would be neat if Salmon could detect these kinds of dramatic dropoffs and add a warning or something... even if not incorporating the information into the quants... it could even be a good QC step to identify large de",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/514#issuecomment-623043651:1011,down,downstream,1011,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/514#issuecomment-623043651,2,['down'],['downstream']

Therefore, many of the reads (especially when they map to parts of the genes that don't differ) show up as pseudoaligned to multiple variants, as you'd expect. In that case, do you suggest only looking at the uniquely mapped reads, or only looking at primary alignments for each read, or still looking at all reads (perhaps with a certain `AS` score) for a given transcript? I'm mostly interested in performing sanity checks that transcriptional variants identified by Salmon/Swish are differentially used across conditions.

Availability,"Thanks. The ref genie thing might be a little big for me to download to be honest. I talked to my PI and he said it was to be expected that the RNA might be low quality. I ran it against mouse DNA as well and the mouse was multiples worse so I guess that's a good sign. The decoy hits also outnumber the mapped hits by about 6:1. But they never exceed about 7%. Does this indicate something wrong with my indexing?. I also tried mapping indexing against human CDS and NCRNA files from ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-100/fasta/homo_sapiens/ and the human genome from the same source. Those had even lower hit rates. That was odd because rRNA wasn't filtered out for this RNA seq, so I would have expected the rRNA parts of the NCRNA to have a lot of hits.

Still, I'm not sure how boost169 was compiled (the src.rpm is not available at the moment, waiting for email from the builder). It was used with other packages though, and if it had an incompatible ABI they should not have worked either. Checking my notes there are a couple of specific programs which had to be compiled with older C++ standards, but none of those are linked to Salmon. Also, if that was the problem, shouldn't these have shown up as unresolved references because of the ABI_TAG (""cxx11"" or ""_cxx11"", according to this:. https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2015/02/05/gcc5-and-the-c11-abi/. ) ?. ccache was installed and was active for the salmon build.

I'm sorry I was not clear enough - my question was acutally meant for a single sequence - let me try again:; Lets say we have a read pair where one mate maps fine - but the other mate have a problem - half of it is an adapter (or low quality sequence with to many errors). How would Salmon currently handle this situation where the first half of a sequence (e.g. nt 1-50) could be quasi-mapped to a transcript but the second half (nt 51-100) did not match anywhere? Would the the second half cause the whole sequence to be discarded or would it be enough that the first half matched for it to be considered/counted?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/150#issuecomment-354955072:314,error,errors,314,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/150#issuecomment-354955072,2,['error'],['errors']

Availability,"The error you're seeing is a result of the BAM parser (libstaden) finding an inconsistency in the BAM file. Specifically, this line of code seems to be triggering the error that is printed (https://github.com/svn2github/staden-io_lib/blob/master/trunk/io_lib/bam.c#L300). This suggests something is awry with the BAM file / header. While I can't see anything immediately problematic from the snippet of the header you posted above, I do see some curious things even in this short region of the header. Specifically, the first transcript `NC_003070.9:0-30427671`, appears to be > 30 million nucleotides long --- this is a very suspicious length for a transcript. Second, the second and third transcripts appear to be exact duplicates.

Availability,"This happens when there was no read in the same length bin during training period (the first so many reads are used for training) as the read under consideration. So Salmon can't assigned a valid log likelihood and an error is reported. The 3 errors are really the same one. The error log likelihood of 3 models are added (based on position of first mismatch/indel, length of clipping at each end of the read). If the length bin is empty for 1 model, it is likely empty for the other 2 models, and 3 warnings are printed when 1 would have been enough. This read gets a error likelihood of 1 and is mostly ignored by Salmon after that.

Availability,"This is not exactly a bug, but a comment and a question regarding how Salmon uses the positioning data in fastq files. We had a series a RNASeq samples where the majority of the reads were listed at 0:0 in the fastq file. We think this is some obscure issue with one of the trimming/demultiplexing pipelines. No one noticed, as this data is not generally used, but it did throw an error with rsem. Luckily, this error had been previously [reported](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rsem-users/qXDCpSbEn6Q). Notably, Salmon using quasi mapping was fine. It was only when I tried again using STAR aligned bam files that I noticed that only those reads not listed at 0:0 were used by Salmon (STAR does not seem to care one way or the other). Obviously, badly formated fastq files do not constitute a bug and we are working on fixing them, but we were curious why the positioning data was being used in alignment mode but not quasi mode. Moreover, why is it being used at all? Is it used to weed out potential artifacts?.

Availability,"This isn't strictly speaking a bug with salmon per-se, but when installing salmon from conda, its impossible to have both R 4.0.3 and Salmon 1.3.0 installed in the same environment (which is frustrating due to the downstream analysis of Salmon data with wasabi/sleuth then requiring a separate environment). The core incompatibility seems to be with the International Components for Unicode package. Salmon requires; ""icu >=64.2,<65.0a0"",; Whereas in one of the R dependencies when installing 4.0.3 in the environment solve the following is specified; ""icu >=67.1,<68.0a0"",. This seems to be the only conflict I could identify.; This seems to be a new incompatibility introduced with R 4.0.3 and Salmon can coexist alongside R 4.0.2 without issue, so this isn't a huge problem but something I thought should probably be on your radar if it isn't already.

Availability,We just discovered that Salmon build removes/collapses identical transcripts. This is very problematic that Salmon does this as many genes are duplicated throughout the genome. By concatenating them in the build index one of these is arbitrary selected (the others removed) meaning all downstream analysis will assume all expression originate from one genomic region instead of many. In the most r[ecent Gencode mouse release](https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse_releases/current.html) this problem affects 1563 sequences annotated as 13812 and covers all transcript types (incl 840 protein coding - although the major once are lincRNA (n=3658) and snoRNAs (n=2622)). We strongly believe that if one want to analyse these duplicated regions jointly this should be done just like one would sum all transcripts from a particular gene to get the gene expression.,MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/214:286,down,downstream,286,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/214,1,['down'],['downstream']

Availability,"Well, one can certainly use a tool (like gffread or rsem-prepare-reference) to take a genome and a (possibly custom/augmented) GTF to extract a set of target transcripts. Above, it looks like you were only processing between 90 and 100k transcripts. Given the overall size of the overall reference — ~2.4 billion nucleotides — my guess would be that some of these transcripts may be exceedingly long (and perhaps extracted incorrectly from the underlying tool). I should note that an index can be built on large references (which is why we support 64-bit index construction), but it's a very rare use-case as most transcriptomes (even large _de novo_ transcriptomes) rarely cross the 2^31 barrier, and I would expect it to consume quite a bit of memory. The default `quasi` indexer of Salmon is optimized to be very fast for typical sized transcriptomes (usually a few hundred mega-bases) at the cost of using more memory. The alternative `fmd` index can be made more memory efficient, by setting a larger sampling factor, but the resulting mapping will be slower (though still much faster than standard alignment). I would first check to see if the transcripts.fa file contains what you were expecting (i.e. the normal transcriptome + the auxiliary transcripts you were interested in quantifying), and that you actually have close to 2.4Gb of non-redundant transcriptome sequence that you want to quantify. If this is the case, the options are to try and build the quasi-index on a large memory machine (building the index requires more memory than mapping with the constructed index), or using the fmd-index with a large sampling factor.

Availability,"Yep, that is what I was reflecting at earlier. Using `--dumpFeatures` you can get the file `filtered_cb_frequency.txt` (this is after CB seq correction, `raw_cb_frequency` is before seq correction). As the file is reverse sorted by frequency you can count the number of CB with frequency `>100` and use that for the `--forceCell`. It does makes alevin multiple pass algorithm but that was the current use case with complex dataset where it fails to find the knee. . One thing to note here would be the downstream whitelisting. If the number of CB becomes too many then it can potentially blow up the memory. However, since you are already parsing the names of the CB (in your awk script) you can pass those CB as the `--whitelist`, alevin will still sequence correct the remaining CB with 1-edit distance around them. The benefit of this is, alevin will not run downstream whitelisting as a list of whitelisted CB has been provided externally.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/362#issuecomment-490907226:502,down,downstream,502,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/362#issuecomment-490907226,2,['down'],['downstream']

We do differential analysis quite commonly with DESeq2, and salmon -> tximport -> DESeq2 is a quite low-friction solution.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/437#issuecomment-751195284:143,reliab,reliable,143,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/437#issuecomment-751195284,1,['reliab'],['reliable']
