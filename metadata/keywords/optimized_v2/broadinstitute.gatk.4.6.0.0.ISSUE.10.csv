Integrability,"ExtractVariantAnnotations:. This tool extracts annotations, labels, and other relevant metadata from variants (or alleles, in allele-specific mode) that do or do not overlap with specified resources. The former are considered labeled and each variant/allele can have multiple labels. The latter are considered unlabeled and can be randomly downsampled using reservoir sampling; extraction of these is optional. The outputs of the tool are HDF5 files containing the extracted data for labeled and (optional) unlabeled variant sets, as well as a sites-only VCF containing the labeled variants. This VCF can be used in ScoreVariantAnnotations to in turn specify an additional ""extracted"" label, which can be useful for indicating those sites that were actually extracted from the provided resources (since we may only extract over a subset of the genome).

Putting together tests using chr1:1-10M snippets of 1) the 1kgp-50-exomes sites-only VCF for the input (since this has both non-AS and AS annotations; EDIT: Scratch that, it only has AS_InbreedingCoeff and AS_QD), 2) the Omni SNP training/truth VCF (yielding ~3.5k training), and 3) the Mills training/truth VCF (yielding ~500 training). Incidentally, VariantRecalibrator SNP and INDEL runs both fail to converge on these small training sets without the #7709 fix, but do converge with it. I still need to check if enough multiallelics are included here; if not, I'll choose a different snippet.

Integrability,"First of all, thank you so much for your hard work! I am excited to explore GATK 4.0.0.0.; I would like to report minor issues in setting up optional dependencies for GATK4. First, `gatkcondaenv.yml` defines `gatkPythonPackageArchive.zip` location as; `build/gatkPythonPackageArchive.zip`; The path doesn't seem to work seamlessly with the release archive, though the path makes sense in the root directory of source repo. Unzipping the package file locates both files in the same directory and, to me, it is natural to create the conda environment in the directory. Second, it would be more convenient to include `install_R_packages.R` in the release like gatkcondaenv.yml for python dependencies. Also, I had an issue running `install_R_packages.R` for fresh compiled R-3.2.5. The way `install_R_packages.R` install `optparse` prevents its dependency (the getopt package) from being automatically installed, because (I guess) repos argument is set to NULL. I think the helper script needs to install the getopt package as well.; ```; optparseUrl=""http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/optparse/optparse_1.3.2.tar.gz""; if (!(""optparse"" %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) {; install.packages(optparseUrl, repos=NULL, type=""source""); }; ```. Finally, it would be convenient to depend on a R version available in conda, so that R dependency can be a part of the gatk conda environment. I wasn't able to get the recommended R-3.2.5 from conda.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4209:150,depend,dependencies,150,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4209,5,['depend'],"['depend', 'dependencies', 'dependency']"

Integrability,"Fixes a bug that I inadvertently introduced long ago in #5408. A method there originally assumed that the intervals to be filtered coincide with the annotated intervals when filtering on annotations, but this assumption can be violated when e.g. using `-XL` to further exclude intervals. This breaks the annotation-based filtering and will result in incorrectly retained/dropped intervals. Unfortunately, the integration test cases were not quite complete enough to catch this. Fortunately, for typical data and parameters, the number of affected intervals is typically a very small percentage, especially in human (e.g., the default GC filters of [0.1, 0.9] affect <0.1% of 250bp bins); I only caught this when running on malaria data, since GC filtering has more impact there. I would also expect count-based filters to mitigate some of the effects (e.g., a bin with extreme GC that was erroneously retained when filtering on annotations might later be filtered because it has poor coverage). Downstream results are also all correct---they're just given for a slightly different set of intervals than would be expected. This bug would affect users that made use of the `blacklist_intervals_for_filter_intervals` option in the gCNV WDLs, but my feeling is this functionality is not used that frequently. @droazen I think this is a relatively minor bug, but it might be good to mention it in the release notes.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7046:409,integrat,integration,409,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7046,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Here are Mark's comments:. ```; * Clip bases from the read in clipper from; * <p/>; * argmax_x{ \sum{i = x + 1}^l (qTrimmingThreshold - qual); * <p/>; * to the end of the read. This is blatantly stolen from BWA.; * <p/>; * Walk through the read from the end (in machine cycle order) to the beginning, calculating the; * running sum of qTrimmingThreshold - qual. While we do this, we track the maximum value of this; * sum where the delta > 0. After the loop, clipPoint is either -1 (don't do anything) or the; * clipping index in the read (from the end).; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/263:621,depend,depending,621,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/263,1,['depend'],['depending']

Integrability,GATK exposes Picard tools thru its command line interface. The usage syntax is different between these two tool kits and so picard code examples in javadocs don't make that much sense when displayed in GATK's own docs. For now code examples embeded in the Picard repo should stick to picard syntax as a matter of principle. So the solution is to transform those snippets on-the-fly when we generate the gatk-docs. . The is a good opportunity to do so in ```GATKHelpDocWorkUnitHandler``` by overloading the ```getDescription(DocWorkUnit)``` so that any occurrence of a picard.jar example is translated into gatk's version:; ```. <pre>java -jar picard.jar toolName \; ARG1=VAL1 \; ARG2=VAL2 ; </pre>; ```. to this:. ```; <pre>gatk toolName \; -ARG1 VAL1 \; --ARG2 VAL2; </pre>; ```.

This is a richer and more flexible approach to working with reads data. It allows you to keep your genomics data in a common BAM file format on Google Cloud Storage and work with it efficiently from your computation pipelines, using standard bioinformatics tools. We have already launched our own open source implementation of this protocol, which you can use to access your reads data. Many popular tools such as samtools and htslib have been updated by the community to support htsget. Documentation is provided here.

Integrability,"Hello - in GATK3 we wrote a variety of custom VariantAnnotation classes, and created a GATK3 fork / custom JAR with those classes. We run VariantAnnotator using that. I am hoping you might comment on whether this plan seems reasonable:. I am going to try to implement this in our DISCVRseq package, which is a standalone package that depends on GATK4. I am currently expecting that I would need to be a separate tool, like ""VariantAnnotationExtended"" in our code. My tool can make an instance of VariantAnnotatorEngine, passing whatever annotationList I see fit. It seems like I will either be able to use GATKTool.makeVariantAnnotations() as-is, or override it to search custom classpaths (not currently clear if that's needed). In the end, my new tool should be able to function like core GATK4 VariantAnnotator, picking up your core annotations and whatever new ones I make. The latter is useful so I dont need to execute two annotation commands if I want to use a combination of annotations. .

Integrability,"Hello @freeseek. It should be noted that you might be somewhat confused about what the -SO arguments do in the tools:; `-SORT_ORDER ""unsorted""` which has the help description `""The order in which the merged reads should be output. Default value: coordinate. Possible values: {unsorted, queryname, coordinate, duplicate, unknown}.""` For MergeBamAlignment that argument doesn't change how the input sort order is treated but rather is used to determine whether the tool will resort your reads before outputting them. Currently it looks like MergeBamAlignment requires queryname sorted inputs: `""Original SAM or BAM file of unmapped reads, which must be in queryname order. Reads MUST be unmapped.""` and will crash with the unhelpful message you encountered. It may be possible to loosen this restriction to queryname-grouped inputs (since it really primarily needs the mates adjacent to each other but not necessarily in readname order). The place to have this discussion would be here https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard since this tool is a picard tool that is called into by GATK and any changes would need to be approved by the maintainers of that repo..

Integrability,Hello @lindenb. . I think I found what is going on here and its a bug on our part that we didn't provide a better error for this issue. In the bed file you uploaded this is the offending interval:; `GL000223.1 178912 180554`; Unfortunately this is the length of that interval in the hg37 decoy sequence dictionary is as follows:; `@SQ SN:GL000223.1 LN:180455`; So it seems the issue here is that something got mangled and you are requesting a bad interval. It turns out we were using a codepath that failed to check that the interval was valid when specified as a bed file and active region padding code was using the correct interval based on the dictionary. This should be an easy fix on your end.

This has the benefit of not requiring client code to put `throws IOException` (or catch the `IOException`) everywhere, and is more consistent with the rest of the codebase, which typically traps checked exceptions as early as possible and wraps them in unchecked exceptions (either `UserException` or `GATKException`, depending on whether it's likely to be the user's fault or not).

Integrability,"Hi @Neato-Nick @davidbenjamin . Apologies for posting this message here. I have posted this message few days before at the regular GATK forum and also using the direct inbox option but have got no response so maybe something wrong with my account. The issue is - I have done variant calling on 384 potato samples following, mostly, GATK best ##practices and have applied hard filters to select SNPs for further usage. However, I am noticing that '--max-nocall-fraction', '--max-nocall-number' and '--max-fraction-filtered-genotypes' arguments for 'SelectVariants' are not working properly. I have tried with various cutoff settings and every time I am observing SNPs with a much larger number of genotypes (~246 out of 384 with 0.10 setting) with 'no call' than the set thresholds. I have searched the forum first but couldn't find any relevant threads. I am using the latest GATK version (4.0.7.0). I am attaching three example sets of (1) log files (2) subset vcf files and (3) vcf index file for the three main vcfs.

Integrability,"Hi @Nehir291, please refer to the SVAnnotate tool documentation for definitions of each annotation: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/21905053774363-SVAnnotate. For translocations, PREDICTED_LOF is assigned if a breakpoint falls at any point in the transcript, so an intronic breakpoint would still be annotated as PREDICTED_LOF for any impacted genes. This is because only part of the gene exists on each chromosome after the translocation, which is likely to result in a truncated transcript subject to nonsense-mediated decay. . Perhaps in some cases this definition is overly permissive, such as if only the UTR or one shorter exon is removed by the translocation - those cases could be worth revisiting. . I hope this helps explain the behavior you are seeing. If this does not fully explain all the PREDICTED_LOF annotations you are observing, please share the CTX breakpoints, the annotations, the SVAnnotate version, and the GTF used so we can investigate further.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8852#issuecomment-2195034147:530,mediat,mediated,530,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8852#issuecomment-2195034147,1,['mediat'],['mediated']
Integrability,"Hi @Vzzarr ,. Thank you for reporting this. I've never heard of this happening before, but I suspect the difference is that you are using maven and we've only ever used gradle. @magicDGS @LeeTL1220 You both build downstream projects, have you ever seen this?. From what I can tell `com.github.fommil.netlib.all` is a POM only dependency, but it's not annotated as such in our generated POM. Gradle resolves it correctly, and then resolves it's transitive dependencies correctly, but maven seems to resolve it differently. . I've reproduced the issue locally, and it seems like it can be fixed by changing this line in our build file:. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/62e339fb9150db19f80d4b48aed8d47608461690/build.gradle#L220. to specify the exact dependencies we want instead of using the all artifact. I'll open a pull request with that. There's an additional catch though, you're using the latest release to maven central, which is actually a very old version. We haven't been able to release newer versions to central because they depend on a snapshot of a fork of a google library that isn't released to central. We publish these to our artifactory server which can be resolved like any other maven repository. Would you be able to work with an artifactory dependency? If you can you can A) use the newer and better gatk, B) I won't have to backport this change on top of beta.2 . We're going to fix the problem of not being in central eventually ( certainly before 4.0 release... ) but until then resolving from our artifactory is probably the best bet.

Integrability,"Hi @Yyx2626, I'm Geraldine, you may remember me from the Beijing training. It was great visiting your team! I'm sorry it took me so long to follow up on this discussion, and I want to thank you again for reaching out to us about integrating the tool that you developed into GATK. We are certainly very interested in providing this enhancement to the research community, and we are now ready to talk about the next steps. . After examining your paper and the source code in Github, we think that the most efficient way to integrate the functionality you developed would be to adapt the filtering parts of your tool to run on the output of Mutect2. So this would be a standalone tool that you would run after Mutect2, much like the current FilterMutectCalls tool. . If the results are comparable to your current tool, then we would take that into the official distribution of GATK. If somehow that integration does not yield satisfactory results, then we would look at integrating the entire tool, though we're hoping it won't be necessary, so we can avoid maintaining duplicate functionality for some of the boilerplate data transformations. . David @davidbenjamin can provide some advice on how to implement this in GATK4; in brief you would need to write some code that applies the filters you developed to a variant context.

All of the surrounding tools have produced the expected outputs when queried except for Mutect2.

There are a few different parameters that can help you adjust the memory ratios.; A good tuning might be something like; ; ```; --num-executors 5 ; --executor-cores 8 ; --executor-memory 32g ; ```. if you're not running with gatk-launch you'll need to set; ```; --conf spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead=600; ```; Without setting a higher than default yarn memory overhead like this we see consistent crashes, it's included in the settings gatk-launch applies already. That should run 5 separate executors with 8 cores each and give each one 32g, so 4g / core. . If you're running in cluster mode you'll have to carve out some memory and cores for the driver. You can set the driver settings with ; ```; --driver-cores 2; --driver-memory 4g; ``` ; or something along those lines. The driver doesn't need much memory or computer for BQSR. In general we've had better luck using the entire cluster for one job and running jobs in sequence rather than trying to run two jobs simultaneously using a subset of the cluster.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3465#issuecomment-324064738:52,depend,depend,52,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3465#issuecomment-324064738,1,['depend'],['depend']
Integrability,"Hi @jean-philippe-martin ,. A `Feature` in our codebase has a specific meaning that is different from ""interval"": it is a record that 1. has a location on the genome plus (typically) some metadata information about that location and 2. is in one of the formats supported by our file-parsing framework tribble and is the product of a tribble codec. A VCF record is an example of a `Feature`. . The common interface between `Feature` and `SimpleInterval` is called `Locatable`. I recommend (for now) that you simply alter your uprooted version of BQSR to take a `List<? extends Locatable>` instead of a `List<? extends Feature>` in `apply()`. This should require no code changes beyond changing method parameter types, and it will allow you to feed BQSR `SimpleIntervals` for the known sites for now, and `Features` like VCF records later on when we're ready for that. Please do return `ArtificialTestFeature` to the `FeatureDataSourceUnitTest` from which it came -- this is a very incomplete class meant only for testing purposes and not for external use.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/511#issuecomment-100393247:404,interface,interface,404,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/511#issuecomment-100393247,1,['interface'],['interface']

Its an oversight in our logging that causes that error message and it should not mean that your execution of SplitNCigarReads was invalid. The inflater in this message is referring to the fact that one of the compressed blocks gets uncompressed with zero output bytes which happens with the very last block of a properly formatted BGZF file (as a your input bam should be).

Integrability,"Hi Christina (@cristinaluengoagullo ),. The GenomicsDBImport in version 4.0.0.0 has a few bugs that you may or may not encounter, but I'd recommend you run GATK 4.0.1.0 or later. That's admittedly a very cryptic error message. We're working on doing a better job wrapping the GenomicsDB errors into readable GATK User Errors. In the meantime, I have a few ideas. Do you have any unusual annotations in that GVCF? The Vidmap takes information from the VCF header annotation descriptions to figure out how to store annotation values after they're parsed.

Integrability,"Hi David,. Thanks for your response and effort developing the best practices pipeline and GATK. I'm not certain, but I would suspect that a significant percentage of your users may also not use the best practices pipeline for one reason or another. In my particular case, I intersect calls from multiple variant callers and prefer to run this pipeline without the added abstraction of Terra (or WDL) for the sake of simplicity. This was easy to fix on my end, thanks again.

Integrability,"Hi Marissa - I think we're all in agreement that we'd like to find a way to make Intel-TF the default, but whether or not we can have CNNScoreVariants require AVX to run is less clear. Naturally, we'd prefer to not have to provide a custom TF distribution for a fallback, but there are 3 cases where we may not have a choice: user with old hardware, Travis/CI testing, and GCE. We may need to provide a fallback environment for those (I'll try to get resolution on that). If it turns out we do, I'm actually not suggesting the fallback be automatic (3 in your list), just that we have a graceful failure mode and an instructive error message. . In the meantime, there is still the issue that this PR fails to even build on Travis. It looks like it produces so much output building the Docker image that it exceeds the allowable Travis build log size. That will need to be resolved, and we'll also need to understand the impact of this change on the size of our Docker image, which is already large, and continues to be a challenge for us.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5291#issuecomment-429451059:634,message,message,634,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5291#issuecomment-429451059,2,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"Hi all, thanks again for working to integrate this code!. Saw some confusion in the comments above and just wanted to clarify: if you take a look at the VQSR-lite PR https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7954/commits that the current branch is rebased upon, you'll see that it contains a version of the Joint Genotyping WDL (which was put together by Megan for Ultima) along with Java code for the tools (which was written by me). Both the WDL and the code have been updated in subsequent PRs. The WDL was rewritten by me in #8074; the main difference is that we no longer run SNPs and indels filtering in ""series"", but instead run them in a single step. However, this requires that you use the same annotations for both SNPs and indels; GVS might not be ready for that just yet, since the default WARP implementation uses different annotations. (But see also the comment here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8074#issue-1423991277. The gist is we can easily reimplement Megan's/WARP's ""serial"" SNP-then-indel workflow using the simpler single-step workflow.) (EDIT: I was originally confused here, Megan’s WDL simply runs SNPs and indels separately—thanks to George for correcting me here!). Note also that test infrastructure was moved from Travis to Github Actions between these PRs, so the Travis references above have already been cleaned up. There have also been a few additional minor PRs merged in the interim, with a couple more incoming. These PRs do not fundamentally change the interfaces of the tools/WDL, however, so I think you can update to them when you're ready. Punchline: this branch should suffice for a first cut of a VQSR/VQSR-lite bakeoff, and although it is already slightly out of date, it shouldn't be too much work to get things updated after the first cut is done.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8157#issuecomment-1412640649:36,integrat,integrate,36,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8157#issuecomment-1412640649,4,"['integrat', 'interface']","['integrate', 'interfaces']"

I'm not really that familiar with concurrency in Java (nor loading native libraries, for that matter), but it seems that the intermittent failure goes away when I refactor the test to remove the DataProvider (by just looping through the implementations in the test method).

Integrability,"Hmm, looks like we lose events 1 and 3 with CollectReadCounts at 250bp using analogous ModelSegments parameters. However, I experimented with tweaking the segmentation to work on the copy ratios (rather than the log2 copy ratios), which seems to recover them. Although one of the goals of having evaluations backed by SV truth sets is to tune such parameters/methods, I'm beginning to think that SV integration might benefit from using the CNV tools in a more customized pipeline---especially if maximizing sensitivity at resolutions of ~100bp jointly with breakpoint evidence is the goal. For example, you might imagine a tool that directly uses CNV backend code to collect coverage over regions specified by `-L`, builds a PoN, denoises, and segments on the fly. Or we can put together a custom WDL optimized for sensitivity.

I realize you have a lot of existing example that dont need this capability.

I have one or two other lab-specific walkers that would benefit from using the iteration pattern of MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart, but also need some ability to retain the FeatureInput->VariantContext link. I believe GATK3 retained this. It would be nice to at least make this a capability available to all MultiVariantWalkerGroupedOnStart walkers.

Integrability,"I didn't realize before that there is no ""include"" (opt-in) validation type arg, only ""exclude"". So I'm not sure what the purpose of having ""ALL"" is in the first place, if the only thing you can usefully do with it is exclude it. I think the best longer term fix would be to add an ""--validation-type-to-include"" arg, and have it default to the everything except for IDs, and then construct the actual types based on merging include/exclude args. But thats a bigger change then just fixing the current (silent do-nothing) default behavior, and requires more error checking for conflicting args. Lets start with changing it so that in the default (no args) case, we log a warning message saying that IDs will be left out since no IDS were provided, and proceed with the remaining validations. Then if we want to get more ambitious we can talk about making the bigger change. Also, as part of the initial fix, it might be a good idea to change `calculateValidationTypesToApply` so that it doesn't modify the `excludeTypes` list directly, since this is the list provided by the user, and instead uses it's own temporary list.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5862#issuecomment-498685279:679,message,message,679,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5862#issuecomment-498685279,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"I don't think that hiding/disable arguments would work in every case: sometimes, an argument shouldn't be exposed but still available to set programmatically, or maybe just reduce visibility making it `@Hidden` and/or `@Advance`. What is the problem of making an interface for the top-level argument to the GATK? Changing the interface or the `CommadnLineProgram` has the same effect, but the API user can still behave the same as before. It is much more extensible and downstream-friendly. What's about making the `CLPConfigurationArgumentCollection` an interface always returning defaults to be able to change it in a proper way? The cycle of development of a new argument will be: 1) add a new method to the interface with a default returning what will be expected from the previous behaviour, 2) add and return by the argument in the GATK implementation, 3) use the getter in the CLP for perform the operation. This only adds the first point, and operating in 3 classes instead of 3. For API user it is really easy to maintain the previous behavior when upgrading the dependency by just using their own implementation of the class, or include the top-level new arguments by using the GATK implementation. It is much more flexible and extensible (I always think about GATK also as a library). In addition, I think that this approach is also important for evolving GATK. For example, if a new top-level argument is tagged as experimental (still not supported but requested in Barclay), removing it would allow to keep the interface (no version bump) the same and final users can still operate with the experimental argument. The same applies to the `GATKTool` base class (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4341), and for downstream projects the aim should be to be able to extend safely the `CommandLineProgram` directly to implement their own toolkit using the powerful GATK framework.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3998#issuecomment-366185003:263,interface,interface,263,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3998#issuecomment-366185003,6,"['depend', 'interface']","['dependency', 'interface']"

Integrability,"I found some edge cases when implemented a new walker based on GATKTool that should be considered in the base class to avoid some mistakes by developers. They should either being correctly handled or documented as not-applicable for some walkers:. - [ ] If a tool/walker overrides getPluginDescriptors to remove the `GATKReadFilterPluginDescriptor`, the method `makeReadFilter` will not return a filter with the `getDefaultReadFilters`. This is important for implementing tools where the user shouldn't be able to override the filters. I suggest to either handle the case where the plugin cannot be detected and return a filter with only defaults, or to specify in the documentation that `makeReadFilter` should be overriden in that case. - [ ] Transformer methods for reads (`makePreReadFilterTransformer`and `makePostReadFilterTransformer`) only have effect in `ReadWalker`(and extensions). I think that the `ReadsContext` should have a method to set pre/post transformers, and call this methods to integrate with every extension of `GATKTool`. Otherwise, it should be documented that it has no effect in most of the cases. @droazen - could you give me some way to proceed here?

Integrability,"I have been running into an issue with Funcotator where some mutations are causing Funcotator to crash because it attempts to query a segment that extends beyond the boundary of the transcript ( see https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6345 ). This pull request addresses the issue by adding a check for transcript length before executing the query. I looked at the code, and Funcotator currently handles problematic sequence queries in `getFivePrimeUtrSequenceFromTranscriptFasta()` by returning an empty string. I modified `getFivePrimeUtrSequenceFromTranscriptFasta()` to also return an empty string when the segment it is trying to retrieve extends beyond the boundary of the transcript. . I have a small VCF that can be used to reproduce the problem using the current code on `master` and the hg38 data source, and I have verified that this pull request allows Funcotator to process the problematic variant without crashing. I did not add the VCF to the tree, but can provide it if that is preferred. Is there any guidance for how to implement integration tests with funcotator?

Integrability,"I have to deal with this component recently and I found the design rather awkward.... In general between GATK and htsjdk we don't seem to have a proper support for managing and querying Supplementary alignment information from read alignment records:. 1. Querying: implemented in htsjdk consists in forging artificial SAMRecords that contain only the alignment info in the SA tag element... It seems to me that it makes more sense to create class to hold this information alone (e.g. ReadAlignmentInfo or ReadAlignment); SATagBuilder already has defined a private inner class with that in mind ""SARead"" so why not flesh it out and make it public. 2. Writing: currently SATagBuilder gets attached to a read, parsing its current SA attribute content into SARead instances. It provides the possibility adding additional SAM record one by one or clearing the list. ... then it actually updates the SA attribute on the original read when a method (setTag) is explicitly called.; I don't see the need to attach the SATag Builder to a read... it could perfectly be free standing; the same builder could be re-apply to several reads for that matter and I don't see any gain in hiding the read SA tag setting process,... even if typically this builder output would go to the ""SA"" tag, perhaps at some point we would like to also write SA coordinate list somewhere else, some other tag name or perhaps an error message... why impose this single purpose limitation?; I suggest to drop the notion of a builder for a more general custom ReadAlignmentInfo (or whatever name) list. Such list could be making reference to a dictionary to validate its elements, prevent duplicates, keep the primary SA in the first position... etc.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3324:1401,message,message,1401,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3324,1,['message'],['message']

This patch fixes two things:. 1) I propose GATK only log this message once, the first time it hits this. 2) I think the logic here is wrong. It lacked parenthesis. This logic was:. ```; if (!jumboGenotypeAnnotations.isEmpty() && !fragmentLikelihoods.isPresent() || !haplotypeLikelihoods.isPresent()) {; ```. In java: ""false && false || true"" gives true, which is not what you want. For example, if jumboGenotypeAnnotations was empty, this would still log if either fragmentLikelihoods or haplotypeLikelihoods tests true. That doesnt seem like what you want.

It's much better but still far more conservative than the F1. . This metric is somewhat counterintuitive to me because if you're dividing by M this is the number of total observations. It seems to me that that number is dependent not on the classifier at all but more on the results of HaploptypeCaller.

Integrability,"I think changes in 4.2.4.1 are exposing an issue, but I think @eriqande is right that the issue isn't with GenomicsDB. The change was that previously GATK wasn't correctly passing the `--max-alternate-allele` argument to GenomicsDB, but now that it is doing so it makes it more likely that some sites don't contain fields like PL (dependent on number of possible genotypes). It looks like the AF calculation used to ignore sites if they didn't have likelihoods, but has now been updated slightly to also allow sites with GQ or sites where any alleles are called+nonref+not symbolic. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/caa48f98c8207b688db6ee35fead3eafb7219e38/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/utils/GenotypeUtils.java#L139-L141. Possibly that condition needs to be tweaked? @ldgauthier might be the best person to ask. As for this working with previous versions, that is only because the `--max-alternate-alleles` wasn't being passed to GenomicsDB correctly. if you want to revert to that behavior you can set `--max-alternate-alleles` to `50` (which is what GenomicsDB defaults to).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7639#issuecomment-1015961941:331,depend,dependent,331,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7639#issuecomment-1015961941,1,['depend'],['dependent']

Integrability,"I think it's best not to co-opt existing formats for storing *variant calls* and *mutations* if we want to store generic annotations. Furthermore, many of the drawbacks of VCF (e.g, wasted space from repeated tags/unused fields) are really not worth dealing with if our data is strictly tabular and well structured. I think if we can settle on a format internally that satisfies all of our needs, then it'd probably a *very small* amount of effort on the part of external developers to write adapters to consume it. After all, we are only talking about metadata (hopefully in a standardized but suitably flexible format, e.g. SAM/VCF-style header) + tabular data. It may also be that there is a format out there that already fits the bill, in which case we just need to do some more research and discussion.

Integrability,"I think that it is necessary to have a way for downstream projects to override some of the top-level arguments in the base CLP class. For example, the config file is for documentation purposes, but I don't want to expose users to that argument because I will set the defaults programmatically. Another example is the GCS retries, which might not be useful for a software that is not planning to support GCS even if it is already implemented (or does not want to expose). As a downstream developer, for me it is important to being able to configure arguments and expose/hide them to my final users; with the current implementation, my main issue is to have an argument that are irrelevant for the toolkit user and that I get questions about why and how to use them (the most clear example, the config file).

In my BASH scripts I often use ""$?"" to monitor the exit status of a process and normally stop if there is an error.

Integrability,"I tried to do it, and I'm afraid that it won't be trivial as I expected: because it is a facade, there is not accesibility to `Logger.setLogLevel()` and this is required to set the verbosity level in the command line. After explore a bit the code, it seems that [`LoggingUtils`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/utils/LoggingUtils.java) is the only place where a concrete implementation should be used. My suggestion is to move this class to a package that could be excluded by the backend user (because it contains methods to change the logging of log4j, I suggest `org.apache.logging.log4j`), which implements a simple interface/abstract class `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.utils.LoggingUtils` to set the log level (LoggingUtils.setLoggingLevel(final Log.LogLevel verbosity)`. The default implementation (that could be used by final users callid`super.setLoggingLevel(final Log.LogLevel verbosity)`) could setup the htsjdk and the java.util.logger.Logger. This implementation requires to change the `CommandLineProgram` to have a setter for the `LoggingUtils` to use, that could be set in `Main` (as in my PR for improve the extensibility of this class). The only pronblem is that it requires to be initialize with a simple implementation class of `LoggingUtils`, which should use the default. I think that this design does not break the behaviour of GATK, but introduce more complexity in the code. If you think that this is worthy, I could implement it today. @lbergelson, I'm not able to run Spark tools in a cluster yet, neither in gcloud dataproc, sorry.

In the edge case you encountered, you used a BAM that was almost completely uncovered in all bins at the specified resolution, resulting in a sample median of zero.

Integrability,"I'm not sure what proportion of users leverage the incremental import functionality...it wasn't available when GenomicsDBImport was first made available, but has been around for ~3 years now. As for workspaces with whole chromosomes -- there is no requirement or performance benefits to using whole chromosomes. As you say, subsetting a chromosome to smaller regions will work and make the import and query parallelizable. (if you remember where the advice about whole chromosomes came from, let us know. That might be something that needs to be updated/clarified). Many small contigs does add overhead to import though and, till recently, multiple contigs couldn't be imported together (i.e., each contig would have it's own folder under the GenomicsDB workspace - which gets inefficient with many small contigs). For WGS, probably the best way to create the GenomicsDBImport interval list is to split based on where there are consecutive N's in the reference genome (maybe using [Picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#ScatterIntervalsByNs)) and/or regions that you are blacklisting. I think you suggested that some of the blacklisted regions were especially gnarly - maybe ploidy or high alternate allele count? - depending on the frequency of those, we may save a bit on space/memory requirements. That may address your concern about overlap between variants and import intervals. In general, any variant that starts in a specified import interval will show up in a query to that workspace.

Based on restricting L and XL it seems that the runtime scales as |L|x|XL|, which comes out to over an hour. The runtime does not depend at all on the size of the vcf in the -V argument. That is, once traversal begins it's basically instantaneous, but processing the intervals takes forever. Naively, one could make this scale as |L| + |XL| by querying each variant in the input vcf against L and then against XL. For reasons @cmnbroad points out this is not a great solution, but it seems like because (i) L and XL are ordered and (ii) each L overlaps with only a sparse subset of XL and vice versa that this quadratic scaling is not necessary.

However, this exercise has revealed some other changes:. `GenotypeGVCFsEngine.callRegion` contains the line `final VariantContext mergedVC = merger.merge(variantsToProcess, loc, ref.getBase(), !outputNonVariants, false)`. Since we want to remove the non-ref allele regardless, we should replace `!outputNonVariants` with `true`. It is important to do this here, because only then does `regenotypeVC` correctly restrict the `AD` to the emitted alleles. Also, doing this strips the variant QUAL from the output if it's monomorphic, which is desired (the `RGQ` field is in the output, so there remains a sense of the quality of the call).

Integrability,"I'm trying to figure out the best way to replicate GATK3 behavior in GATK4. The GATK4 VariantWalker iterates all variants from VCF(s), calling apply() once per variant. If the input VCFs has duplicates at a given location, apply() is called multiple times for the same locus. In GATK3, VariantEval iterates each locus, and generates a list of variants at that site. I'm trying to figure out the most efficient way to do this in GATK4. One solution is to override traverse(), and add some kind of groupingBy step, for example:. StreamSupport.stream(getSpliteratorForDrivingVariants(), false); .filter(variantfilter); .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(x -> new SimpleInterval(x))); .values(); .forEach(variantList -> {; final SimpleInterval variantInterval = new SimpleInterval(variantList.get(0));; apply(variantList,; new ReadsContext(reads, variantInterval, readFilter),; new ReferenceContext(reference, variantInterval),; new FeatureContext(features, variantInterval));. progressMeter.update(variantInterval);; });. This will get me the right end result (like of variants per site); however, it's not clear to me if this is the most efficient route, and I'm not sure if it's aware of the sorted input. Because the input data are sorted, I could iterate, track the previous location and maintain a list of track variants per site. Each time we hit a new location I call apply() with that list.

Integrability,"If you train a VQSR model on a subset of the variants under consideration and serialize it, then provide it via `--input-model` to subsequent VQSR runs on sets of variants including those other than in the original training subset (the only use case for which you'd bother serializing a model in the first place, probably), this will result in variants in those subsequent sets being incorrectly labeled as `NEGATIVE_TRAINING_SITE`. The culprit lines of code are: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/5b8736715724d6ba7994613acbc37e1bf187f538/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/walkers/vqsr/VariantRecalibrator.java#L644-L650. Instead, only those negative training sites taken from the original subset and used to generate the serialized negative model should be labeled as such. Note also that we needlessly select the worst scoring variants here, which leads to the bad behavior as well as a misleading log message. There is also some residual funkiness from the fact that we require the specification of the number of training variants in order to construct a GMM from a serialized model, which is a result of further funkiness from the fact that we require the size of the array of responsibilities to be initialized using this number. Unfortunately, I don't think there's an easy fix, since we don't actually pass either the correct positive/negative training labels (in the recal table generated by the original run) or the necessary information to reconstruct them otherwise (e.g., we could repeat the VQSLOD calculations, given the original training subset sites and VQSLOD cutoffs used to originally derive the negative labels) to these subsequent runs. (Unless we actually want to pass those things, which seems messy.). Note also that the `POSITIVE_TRAIN_SITE` label is still applied to sites that get dropped because of standard deviation thresholding and are hence not used to train the positive GMM, which seems slightly inconsistent (since the `NEGATIVE_TRAIN_SITE`",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7630:930,message,message,930,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7630,1,['message'],['message']

Then ask the CNV team to prototype an example tool or two that use `PythonScriptExecutor` to call into a Python machine-learning library, and do an assessment of maintainability, etc. `PythonScriptExecutor` will come with an attached set of conditions for its use, intended to address the most serious issues raised by the engine and support teams with having Python code in the GATK. We should document these conditions in the docs for `PythonScriptExecutor` when it's implemented:. 1. All tools that use `PythonScriptExecutor` must have a Java-based front-end, with standard GATK (barclay-based) arguments. We put a lot of development effort into our arg parser and into striving for user-interface consistency across tools, and cannot afford to duplicate this effort in Python. Geraldine (CC'd) and the rest of the support team can back me up on this one!. 2. An honest effort should be made to minimize the amount of code written in Python -- as much of each tool's work as possible should be done in Java. In particular, reading/writing final inputs and outputs should happen in Java. This is important for a number of reasons, including the engine team's goal of ensuring universal GCS support, consistent Google authentication handling, etc. Again, we really don't want to have to duplicate that work in Python, or for the tools that call into Python to be inconsistent with the rest of the toolkit. 3. All dependencies (Python and native) of Python libraries used will be clearly documented, and included in the default GATK docker image.

Users pass in a configuration table (see tool documentation for an example) specifying one or more stratification groups classified by SVTYPE, SVLEN range, and reference context(s). The latter are specified as a set of interval lists using `--context-name` and `--context-intervals` arguments. All variants are matched with their respective group which is annotated in the `STRAT` INFO field.

In her case, the sheer complexity of the assembly graph caused two undesirable things: 1) the true variant was missing from the best haplotypes and 2) the evidence for the true variant was diluted beyond recognition among many spurious haplotypes.

Integrability,"In helping @bhanugandham figure out why a particular site was failing it became apparent that merging dangling head code was failing to recover deletions in the dangling head. Furthermore there is some code in the dangling end recovery code that asserts a certain high standard of matching (usually 1 but sometimes dangling branch length/kmersize) `getMaxMismatches(final int lengthOfDanglingBranch)`. Both of these facts seem likely to cause dangling heads to be dropped despite their being still potentially informative, particularly the indel code. . I have added the ability for the index recovery code to account for the cigar string when merging dangling ends. Addtionally rather than counting mismatches to reject the branch it simply requires a minimum matching end (which can be changed, I suspect this is where the lionshare of the differences come from).

Integrability,In light of the recent #7357 and #7358 it has become clear that we are blind changes that cause the logging outputs for GATK to become unusable because we are spitting endless warnings to stdout. I think we should change our integration tests to capture the log output for each of our tests and assert that none of them balloon beyond some reasonable threshold that would capture these problems (perhaps a megabyte but it would take a little bit of sleuthing to be sure). . I would think the best place would be to add a capture into `CommandLineProgramTest.runCommandLine()` that instead of using the current behavior `injectDefaultVerbosity()` we instead leave the logging output as the default and capture it somewhere explicit where we can make assertions about the size of the outputs. Possibly we could create a dummy logging level that just saves and counts the outputs so we can make assertions about the logs. Ideally this should apply to every tool simultaneously since it would be too patchwork to simply add logging output tests for enough of the tools to protect us manually.,MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7368:225,integrat,integration,225,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7368,2,"['inject', 'integrat']","['injectDefaultVerbosity', 'integration']"

Integrability,"In the WGS SV pipeline, for deletions and duplications that the pipeline believes to be biallelic we do the following:. - ALT: `<DEL>` or `<DUP>`; - SVTYPE: `DEL` or `DUP`; - GT: `0/0` or `0/1` or `1/1`. We currently report depth based copy number and quality for these variants in custom format fields `RD_CN` and `RD_GQ` if they are available; we could possibly move those values to the standard `CN` and `CNQ`, but there is some complexity in how to handle events detected by paired end and split reads without good read depth support; ie those under 1kb or so depending on our depth binning size and the coverage. Our depth genotyping module makes estimates of copy number for these sites but sometimes these can be very inaccurate so at the moment we prefer not to report total copy number in those fields. Probably what we _should_ do is fill in CN with 0, 1, or 2 based on the genotype we emitted and set CNQ to the value we computed for GQ. For multiallelic CNVs (i.e. sites where our model is not sure that the variant is bi-allelic) we write:. - ALT: `<CNV>`; - SVTYPE: `CNV`; - GT and GQ: `.`; - CN and CNQ: estimate of total (diploid/unphased) copy number and quality of the depth evidence. I think there are some tradeoffs in completely characterizing the evidence for and quality of each call and enabling easy searching across the whole VCF without having to parse and understand the entire record. Older versions of our pipeline used to put the diploid copy number of the event into the GT field, I think similarly to what's being described above. This is incorrect VCF -- GT values should be indices into the allele list for the variant, and should be a list of length equal to the ploidy. . My view is that if you can confidently infer the alleles present at the site in the sample set you should use a GT value of the form `0/1`, and if you don't know or aren't interested in trying to infer them you should use CN for total copy number and CNQ for the quality.

Integrability,"Investigate whether there's a way to use java.nio.file.Path transparently with files in GCS buckets. We already know we can do this for files in HDFS, as someone has implemented a Java NIO file system provider for HDFS (https://github.com/damiencarol/jsr203-hadoop) -- as long as we have this provider in our classpath, any method that accepts a java.nio.file.Path argument will automatically work with files in HDFS, even if that method lives in a project (like htsjdk) that does not have a Spark/Hadoop dependency or any direct awareness of HDFS. Does such a thing exist for GCS as well? If not, would it be easy to implement?

Integrability,"Is this the only `CommandLineException` which should be an `UserException`? If not, how is going to work the development of new exceptions in Barclay. For instance, in https://github.com/broadinstitute/barclay/pull/11 there is a new exception that I made for values out of range, which extends `BadArgumentValue`. I agree that this errors should be decoupled from the ones that are not, but in this case I think that this is already implemented:. * `UserException` are handled in the `mainEntry()`, distinguishing errors that comes from the user's side regarding some specifications in the tools/framework.; * `CommandLineException` are handled in `parseArgs()`, distinguishing errors that comes from the command line from the user side while parsing. I expect that any command line error that is not `CommandLineParserInternalException ` or `ShouldNeverReachHereException` comes from the user's side. The contract in Barclay says that are `CommandLineException` are _""Exceptions thrown by CommandLineParser implementations.""_, and I think that if other parts of the code (outside arg parsing) is throwing this exception is a bug that does not come from the user. I guess that this is the problematic part.; * Any other `Exception` is thrown in `Main.handleNonUserException()`, which may be caused by non-user exceptions. I propose that `CommandLineException` is handled as currently to separate ""errors that are the user's fault regarding input and/or assumptions"" (`UserException`), ""errors that are the user's fault while providing parameters to the command line"" (`CommandLineException`) and ""errors that are not the user's fault"" (other `Exception`s). Actually, this is reasonable because the exit status is different for any kind of errors in the current `Main`. The only problem that I see with this approach is the silently failing of a ""bug"" in tools/engine code, which can be rethrow easily in `CommandLineProgram.instanceMain`` as following:. ```java; public Object instanceMain(final Strin",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2324#issuecomment-268773161:906,contract,contract,906,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2324#issuecomment-268773161,1,['contract'],['contract']

And okay, I understand that an aligner could represent this as a G->T subsitution, but what about the same thing but with 2D followed by 2I? That strikes me as a much better cigar than calling it a DNP. In general, a bad cigar should mean either that the aligner is bad (in which case why are we filtering isolated reads and not just rejecting the entire BAM?) or the read is malformed.

Currently we choose the alleles in the GT by taken the genotype that have the largest likelihood ignoring priors on genotypes (or allele frequencies) and the fact that unphase GT means that the het likelihood it supposed to be doubled (as part of the posterior calculation).

Integrability,"It seems a lot of users use bcftools on their VCFs, and it sometimes converts floats to integers. For example MQ=31.0 to MQ=31. This change causes GATK tools to error. Is it possible to relax this validation?. ----; User Report; ----. Hi,. Every time I had this message, this was due to bcftools which can change some float values to an integer representation : (e.g : before bcftools : MQ=31.0; after bcftools : MQ=31). . The fact that GATK is very strict on that subject (40.0 is considered as a float while 40 is not) have some advantages and some drawbacks. I hope this problem will be resolved in GATK4 because bcftools is really useful and widely used when dealing with vcf files.

Integrability,"It was a feature which we would have loved, but alas this isn't the case. We also relied on ```-ct``` to get percent of bases depending on their coverage (ex. 20x) which has now been dropped in GATK 4+ versions.

When compared to DepthOfCoverage - ; - It uses multithreading (albeit only for deflation, so no performance gains when going beyond 4 threads).; - It gives coverage for exome within 5 minutes, and even faster when we don't need the per base coverage output.; - Per base coverage output can be skipped using ```-x``` the output of this matches closely to output from DepthOfCoverage. Do keep in mind, DepthOfCoverage also supports this skipping when using the parameter ```--omitDepthOutputAtEachBase``` which saves massively on I/O and cuts processing time from 50 minutes per sample to 40 minutes per sample. If you do decide to give it a try, we have some tips and suggestions - ; - The tool generates multiple output files. If looking for total coverage, check the last line of file ```output.mosdepth.summary.txt```; - If looking for percent of bases covered at target read depth, this information is present in file ```output.mosdepth.region.dist.txt```. If your target read depth is 20x, you can search this file with ```grep -P ""total\t20\t""``` and the third column should be the percentage (with only one decimal); - By using ```-d4``` switch, they claim the above percentage granularity increases to 4 decimal points.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7890#issuecomment-1153478071:126,depend,depending,126,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7890#issuecomment-1153478071,1,['depend'],['depending']

Integrability,"Just got an update by email from the GP team indicating that their perspective is that these are valid index files. It seems that this issue lives in a liminal space where Mutect2 is crashing due to reasons that are not a GATK bug, but also not due to any formal problem in the GP pipeline either. Still, I'm running Broad-built software on recently sequenced Broad-provided genetic data, so it seems a little odd that these aren't playing well together. Trying to think of a solution so that other people in this situation aren't left confused by the error message, is this error specific enough that an additional statement could be added to the error message, e.g., ""This error may be triggered by CRAM indexes produced by older implementations of `htsjdk`, in which case reindexing with an updated `htsjdk` may resolve this problem.""?

Then f_tester generates and returns test_data. The flow looks like; ```; // get either random test solutions or some distinct set that tests particular edge cases; test_params = get_test_params();; test_solution = easy_solution_from_params(test_params);. test_data = test_data_factory(test_params, test_solution);; assert f_algo(test_data) == test_solution;; ```; In some sense you've already done that, but you've personally stepped in as test_data_factory(), and I'm wondering if it would be possible to automate that to get rid of all those numbers in the test code.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4677#issuecomment-384785429:670,rout,route,670,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4677#issuecomment-384785429,1,['rout'],['route']

Integrability,"Looking at the stack trace, the error takes place in a low-level BAM input reading component in a dependency library.... It seems that is trying to read as a number portions of the contig name for a read record in the input... which makes very little sense.... . My guess is that either it is a bug entirely contained in that library (is the name seqdoop?), say it does not tolerate those contig names, or that the user managed to input a bam file that isn't formatted correctly on those records.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3357#issuecomment-317817540:98,depend,dependency,98,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3357#issuecomment-317817540,1,['depend'],['dependency']
Integrability,"Looks like all packages *except* ggplot2 were successfully installed. The following lines in the R script are responsible for installing 3 of the packages:. ```; dependencies = c(""ggplot2"",""gplots"",""gsalib""); repos <- c(""http://cran.cnr.Berkeley.edu"",; ""https://cran.mtu.edu"",; ""http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/""); missing <- which(!(dependencies %in% rownames(installed.packages()))); try <- 1; while(length(missing)!=0 & try <= length(repos)) {; install.packages(dependencies[missing], repos = repos[try], clean = TRUE); missing <- which(!(dependencies %in% rownames(installed.packages()))); try <- try + 1; }; ```. I guess this is supposed to ensure that the installs don't fail due to intermittent connection errors, etc., but each repo is only hit once and it's possible for the loop to exit with dependencies still missing. Could this have happened when the current base image was built and pushed? @jamesemery did you push this image?. Also, I learned that *reshape2* (as opposed to reshape) is actually a dependency of ggplot2 that is automatically installed along with ggplot2. So the original removal of reshape from the `install.packages` list was fine. However, the import statement that is removed in this PR fails whether or not ggplot2 successfully installs, and is extraneous in any case. This is all consistent with the fact that the users from the forum post only get an error message about reshape and not ggplot2. Note that they are using broadinstitute/gatk:4.0.4.0, in which ggplot2 is successfully installed.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5026#issuecomment-406028261:162,depend,dependencies,162,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5026#issuecomment-406028261,14,"['depend', 'message']","['dependencies', 'dependency', 'message']"

Integrability,"Multiple causes can cause closed connections when reading from GCS, almost all of which are outside of our control. This will never be ""completely fixed"" in the sense that even if the code is perfect it's completely possible to send too many requests to GCS, and it'll respond by closing connections. The main factors that I know of are:. - number of concurrent accesses to the GCS bucket in question; - number of concurrent accesses to the GCP project in question; - storage class of the GCS bucket in question (the more expensive ones have more replicas, thus can handle a higher load). If you're running into those difficulties I would suggest trying to reduce the load (reduce the number of concurrent workers or threads) and making sure it's not a single-region storage bucket. If that fails, perhaps try using a different bucket that no one else is also using (to reduce other sources of load). If I understand correctly that you didn't change the version you're using but are suddenly seeing more issues than before, then perhaps the cause is a server-side change from GCS (outside of our control), a change in configuration (are you reading from a bucket of a different class from before), or perhaps just an increase of other activity on the same bucket/project. The current code is very persistent in its retries: as you can see from the messages it spent a whole half hour waiting. If it's an overload situation then you may get better performance by reducing the worker count (as they will have to retry less).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5631#issuecomment-526270716:1348,message,messages,1348,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5631#issuecomment-526270716,1,['message'],['messages']

Integrability,"Nice that HTSJDK is moving forward to version 3. The points that I would like to address are similar to yours, with some inclussions. * Regarding NIO support, I would go to remove completely `File` support. If API users need to use the `File` abstraction, they should convert to a `java.nio.Path` using the `toPath` method.; * In addition, I would like that HTTP/S and FTP is handled also with NIO. For HTTP/S, I am working in a simple `FileSystemProvider` that should be good enough for using in combination with HTSJDK ([jsr203-http](https://github.com/magicDGS/jsr203-http)), and I can speed up the development there for needs in HTSJDK; for FTP, maybe [ftp-fs](https://github.com/robtimus/ftp-fs) can be used or a simple implementation can be derived from the HTTP/S implementation (without credentials). This will remove the special handling of HTTP/S and FTP paths in HTSJDK in favor of a consistent and pluggable manner.; * Interfaces for the data types are great, and maybe it will be good to have codec interfaces for both encoding and decoding. For example, I am missing encoders in tribble (an attempt in https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/pull/822 for writing support).; * For VCF, I would like to have a less diploid-centric interface and design, or at least a way of configure the catching of genotype-related attributes. Currently there are methods for homozygotes/heterozygotes that aren't really useful for triploids or even VCFs without variation (for example, in Pool-Seq data).; * Modular design for artifacts: thus, a project with only SAM/BAM requirements will require only `htsjdk-sam`, and if they also want CRAM support, `htsjdk-cram`. See https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/issues/896 for more info about it.; * Common license for all HTSJDK, or at least for each module. This will be good for taking into account legal concerns when including the library, because now there is a mixture depending on the files that are used. This is what is coming to my mind now.

I think it would be easiest for the reviewer to look at the 4 ""bubbled up..."" commits separately when reviewing the exposure of each parameter set, but then look at the overall commit when reviewing more superficial things or the tests.; 4) I'd appreciate it if the reviewer double checked that I did not switch anything up in parameter names, doc strings, default values, etc. when introducing the 12 explicit args in AssemblyBasedCallerArgumentCollection.

Integrability,"OK, I experimented a bit with removing the R install from the base image and adding the R dependencies to the conda environment in a branch and rebased on that. A few issues that I've run into or that came up in discussion with @jamesemery and @cmnbroad:. -I moved all tests that depend on R into the `python` test group (which should perhaps be renamed to `conda`). Note that some of these also fall into the `spark` test group---not sure if there is any special Spark setup done for that group, but we should make sure that they don't fail if they're not run with the conda environment. -@cmnbroad mentioned that some Picard tools that depend on R may break outside of the conda environment if the user does not have the R dependencies. -When we install R in the base image, we pull in a lot of basic dependencies (e.g., build-essential, various libraries and compilers, etc.) So when the R install is removed, it looks like many tests begin failing or hanging, perhaps because they are falling back on Java implementations (e.g., AVX PairHMM tests). We need to determine the dependencies for these tests and install them separately.

Integrability,"OK, I think things are looking good! Updated a bunch of things, including the following:. - conda 23.1.0 -> 23.10.0; in the base Docker, also disabled conda auto-updating and set the solver to the much faster libmamba (NOTE: before this PR went in, this change was actually made in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8610); - python 3.6.10 -> 3.10.13; - pymc 3.1 -> 5.10.0; - theano 1.0.4 -> pytensor 2.18.1; - added pytorch 2.1.0; - removed tensorflow 1.15.0 and other CNN dependencies; - added libblas-dev to the base Docker; I think MKL versions of all packages are being used, but we should verify!. These and other packages (numpy, scipy, etc.) are all pretty much at the latest available versions for python 3.10. I've also bumped version numbers for our internal python packages. I also made all of the changes to the gCNV code to accommodate any changes introduced by PyMC/Pytensor. For the most part, these were minor renamings of `theano`/`tt`/etc. to `pytensor`/`pt`/etc. However, there were some more nontrivial changes, including to 1) model priors (since some of the distributions previously used were removed or are now supported differently), 2) the implementation of posterior sampling, 3) some shape/dimshuffle operations, and other things along these lines. Using a single test shard of 20 1kGP WES samples x 1000 intervals, I have verified determinism/reproducibility for DetermineGermlineContigPloidy COHORT/CASE modes, GermlineCNVCaller COHORT/CASE modes, and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls. Numerical results are also relatively close to those from 4.4.0.0 for all identifiable call and model quantities (albeit far outside any reasonable exact-match thresholds, most likely due to differences in RNG, sampling, and the aforementioned priors).

Integrability,"OK. I found a potential solution. For this solution, we do not need to add or remove any dependencies. The only change is to the `log4j.properties` file (which configures log4j 1.x) to match the config specified in `log4j2.xml` (which configures log4j2). Now, GKL will use log4j 1.x to log, but the format will match the rest of GATK, which uses log4j2. This means that we have only one GKL for both GATK 3 and 4, at the expense of having to keep to config files, `log4j.properties` and `log4j2.xml`, in sync (which they probably should have been anyway, thought they weren't).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3416#issuecomment-320779413:89,depend,dependencies,89,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3416#issuecomment-320779413,1,['depend'],['dependencies']
Integrability,"OK. In GATK3, the sharding size is calculated in `GenomeAnalysisEngine.getShardStrategy`. Since `GenotypeGVCFs` is a RodWalker and does not use input reads (BAM file), the shard size is `1,000,000`. ; This might be more than a thread safety bug (which is easy to fix, by making `GenotypingEngine.calculateOutputAlleleSubset() ` `synchronized`). What worries me is If the cache of upstream deletions spans intervals, this code will not work since the processing is asynchronous. For example, if there are 2 threads and the removed deletion crosses the shard barrier and the downstream interval thread is first to process, it will not see the upstream removed deletion.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2326#issuecomment-270467197:329,synchroniz,synchronized,329,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2326#issuecomment-270467197,1,['synchroniz'],['synchronized']

Integrability,"On branch `ll_CollectAllelicCountsSpark`, I have created a CLI called: `CollectAllelicCountsSpark` ... This tool will have the exact same functionality as `CollectAllelicCounts`, to the point where I can re-use the integration tests. However, the integration tests fail. When I dig deeper in `CollectAllelicCountsSpark`, I see that only 8 RDDs (correct amount: 11) are being passed to processAlignments... Consider the following code:. ```; @Override; protected void processAlignments(JavaRDD<LocusWalkerContext> rdd, JavaSparkContext ctx) {; final String sampleName = SampleNameUtils.readSampleName(getHeaderForReads());; final SampleMetadata sampleMetadata = new SimpleSampleMetadata(sampleName);; final Broadcast<SampleMetadata> sampleMetadataBroadcast = ctx.broadcast(sampleMetadata);. final AllelicCountCollector finalAllelicCountCollector =; rdd.mapPartitions(distributedCount(sampleMetadataBroadcast.getValue(), minimumBaseQuality)); .reduce((a1, a2) -> combineAllelicCountCollectors(a1, a2, sampleMetadataBroadcast.getValue()));; final List<LocusWalkerContext> tmp = rdd.collect();; ....snip....; ```. In this case `tmp` will have a size of 8. However, the integration test would indicate a size of 11 is correct, since 11 intervals are being passed in. Note that `emitEmptyLoci()` returns `true`, so 11 is the correct number as seen in `CollectAllelicCountsSparkIntegrationTest` . . Additionally, in (at least) one result, the counts are wrong. `CollectAllelicCounts` (non-spark) passes the integration test. I have tried a couple of tests to gather more information:. - Is `emitEmptyLoci()` causing an issue? ; Does not appear to be causing the issue. I say this because when set to `false`, I get (essentially) the same error.; - The code uses `mapPartition` and not `map`, does this cause the issue? Why are you doing this?; This does not cause the issue. I refactored the code to use `map` and got the exact same issue.

Integrability,"Original behavior during development relied on Spark mllib's computeSVD to return something sensible even if a PoN was built with only one sample; typically this would yield a singular value of 0 and an eigenvector of NaNs (although it can also result in miscellaneous exceptions, depending on how many zeros are contained in the single-row matrix on which we perform SVD). At one point, I added a check that at least one non-negligible singular value was returned (even when building a PoN with multiple samples). This spoiled the ability to build single-sample PoNs (which is useful if you only have a matched pair). I've added more explicit logic about how single-sample PoNs are built.

Integrability,"Originally by @vruano in Classic GATK Pivotal. Improve the read threading process in order to minimize loss of information without affecting the accuracy of calls. . Here I list a few details and ideas to take in consideration:. A. Currently (unless recover of dangling heads is active) we start threading at the first unique kmer of the read (sequence). There are at least two unsound aspect to this approach:. A.1 Since we are generating those vertices as we thread the resulting graph and edge weights may be different depending of the sequence (read) threading order. . A.2 We are throwing away information located at the beginning of the read before the first unique (and existing) k-mer in each sequence is found. This is partly fixed by the approach taken when we recover dangling heads yet it seems to have other problems downstream when selecting or pruning haplotypes:. ```; https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/67601310; ```. B. Low support chain pruning might not be longer needed. Now we have a newer approach to select best haplotypes that can handle complex graph we might well not need to prune low supported hap early as they seemly they won't be selected if the are not amongst the best haplotypes. . B.1 Now that still would produce a considerable number of unlikely haplotypes that would cause a CPU burden. That can be changed by imposing another kinds of limit, For example we include all haplotypes with scores (likelihoods) that are Q0 - Q40 or we include haplotypes until the sum of their likelihoods is larger than the 99.99% probability mass. . B.2 This could provide a downstream solution to the problem caused by ranging heads recovery (explained above in A.2). B.3 If pruning is to be maintained, it makes more sense to do it at the very end after all dangling ends hav been recovered and the edges supports are finalized. Of course I assuming here that dangling end recovery does the sensible think of updating those supports are the graphs is modified. C.

Integrability,"Originally from @vruano . Depending of what ploidy we use AR may return different active region boundaries. This differences cause the haploid assembly to fail with the larger region hightlight the lack of robustness of the current approach. More concretely the problem seem to be the presence of cycle in the larger region. Files are located in . ```; /humgen/gsa-hpprojects/dev/valentin/bug-reports/non-rubsassembly-with-ploidy4. cd $THAT_DIR; sh ./run.sh; ```. in CEUTrio*ploidy4.vcf the variant 20:22064431 is missing (as some other in the same region) which is a TP in knowledge base. . If you look into the debug output ploidy2.err and ploidy4.err, the latter attempts to assemble a larger region failing due to a cycle. . AR traversal comes out with different active region boundaries because the engine used takes as a parameter the ploidy. That is not by itself a bug and a bad think is just that the assembly fails for the extended region. . The task here is to improve the assembly algorithm to cope with this situations better (perhaps handle cycles appropriately).",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/267:26,Depend,Depending,26,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/267,1,['Depend'],['Depending']
Integrability,"Our R dependency is primarily for producing plots. It could be possible to create plots using javascript instead. Javascript plots have several potential advantages but also several major downsides. The biggest and most obvious drawback is that we don't have any code to produce them yet, and they are likely harder to generate and experiment with than R scripts. . The advantage would be that we could avoid requiring an R installation to run hellbender scripts, we could potentially also include interactive plotting or other neat tricks to make the plots more useful. I see 2 possible routes to replacing Rscripts with javascript. The first would be for tools that require graphs to perform some html generation and produce html reports with embedded javascript. The user could then open these in their browser and view the plots ( much like how our test suite report and jacoco is done). . A different option would be to use javascript plotting libraries directly within the jvm to generate SVG. Java 8 has a new javascript engine which is supposed to be reasonably fast and offers access to java objects from within it. Unfortunately it doesn't offer a full DOM like a browser does, so most existing javascript libraries will fall over. It seems like it would take a lot of hacking to get something like d3 to run directly on the jvm. (someone has done something of the kind here: http://jazdw.net/content/server-side-svg-generation-using-d3js) . Other options would be to use the javafx web panes to display a browser directly, or to plot directly on a canvas.

Integrability,"R addresses two phasing bugs, https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6463 and https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6845. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6463 identified a bug in the phasing algorithm which caused the wrong phase information to be output for scenarios where the first variant in a phase set is homozygous variant and it is followed by het variants in opposite phase. Without this change the het variants were incorrectly placed on the same phase strand because the phase set was tied to the hom var variant, and the algorithm assumed that each het variant could be put in the same phase strand as it because it was on all haplotypes. I've modified the algorithm to keep track, for variants that occur on all haplotypes, of which of the haplotypes have already been used for phasing an upstream ""comp"" variant so that further downstream variants can be checked against the remaining set. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6845 showed an example of phase sets being disrupted by the presence of an alternate haplotype that supported an additional, uncalled, variant in the region. In this case there was an alternate haplotype supported by two reads that supported a SNP downstream of two pairs of SNPs in alternate phase. The presence of an additional haplotype causes the phasing algorithm to break the phase sets in the region. I've modified the algorithm to only use haplotypes that support the alternate alleles present in called variants in phasing by modifying the number that we pass as `AssemblyBasedCallerUtils.constructPhaseSetMapping()`'s `totalAvailableHaplotypes` parameter. In my opinion this ; fix produces output that is still correct and is much easier to understand (since it only depends on sites that are visible in the output VCF), but if anyone objects to this change please let me know. .

Integrability,"Ran into this when trying to create a PoN with 100 samples x 100 bp bins = 1.27 * max int elements. This currently causes issues when truncating outliers, at which point all elements are loaded into an array so that Percentiles can be naively computed, resulting in a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException`. Solutions include: 1) simply throwing a message and failing early if the counts matrix is too large (perhaps recommend scattering by contig, see #4728), 2) changing the outlier truncation procedure to be more robust. I'm not sure how important outlier truncation is to the SVD, as it remains to be evaluated, but for now we should be able to get around this with no code changes by simply disabling it (i.e., setting the relevant truncation percentile to 0). Note that file I/O takes about an hour for this case. Also note that this is probably on the extreme end of what we should expect to support on a single machine with all counts in memory, as the SVD is probably sufficiently good with 100 samples and 100 bp is on the order of the read length. #4728 will get around this and also make downstream tasks complete faster in parallel, at the very small expense of reducing a few global parameters to per-contig parameters in the modeling step.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4734:348,message,message,348,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4734,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"Rationale for engine changes:; This tool opens a large number of feature files (TSVs, not VariantContexts) and iterates over them simultaneously. No querying, just a single pass through each.; Issue 1: When a feature file lives in the cloud, it takes unacceptably long (several seconds, typically) to initialize it. A few seconds doesn't seem like a long time, but when there are large numbers of feature files to open, it adds up. This is caused by a large number of codecs (mostly the vcf-processing codecs) opening and reading the first few bytes of the file in the canDecode method. To avoid this I've reversed the order in which we test each codec, checking first if it produces the correct subtype of Feature, and only then calling canDecode. If you don't know what specific subtype you need, you can just ask for any Feature by passing Feature.class. It's much faster that way.; Issue 2: Each open feature source soaks up a huge amount of memory. That's because text-based feature reading is optimized for VCFs, which can have enormously long lines. So huge buffers are allocated. The problem is compounded for cloud-based feature files for which we allocate a large cloud prefetch buffer. (Though that feature can be turned off, which helps a little.) But the biggest memory hog is the TabixReader, which always reads in the index, regardless of whether it's used or not. Tabix indices are very large. To avoid this, I've created a smaller, simpler FeatureReader subclass called a TextFeatureReader that loads the index only when necessary. The revisions allow the new tool to run using an order of magnitude less memory. Faster, too.; Issue 3: The code in FeatureDataSource that creates a FeatureReader is brittle, and tests for various subclasses. To allow use of the new TextFeatureReader, I added a FeatureReaderFactory interface that allows one to ask the codec for an appropriate FeatureReader.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8031#issuecomment-1284340770:1832,interface,interface,1832,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8031#issuecomment-1284340770,2,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"Resolves issue #1370 by exposing the setting for Spark logging level with a separate CLI argument (`--spark-verbosity`). Also stifles overly-verbose executor INFO-level logging by setting the default to WARN. This was much cleaner to implement than just applying the existing `--verbosity` to the Spark context for a few reasons. First, Spark's `INFO` level is far too verbose, but most GATK tools provide useful INFO messages. This gives the user the ability to tune them separately. Also, Spark offers more levels through log4j, and mapping from htsjdk logging levels with a bunch of `if` statements didn't seem ideal. Verbose logging only seems to be a problem with when running `/gatk/gatk` inside the GATK docker (eg PathSeq log files easily in 100's of MB). Strangely, however, I found there was no verbose logging if I cloned GATK inside the docker and rebuilt from source with `gradlew buildAll`. Since I can't pinpoint the cause, I haven't included tests for this, but I don't expect test coverage to drop. Note that Spark generates some INFO logging when the context is initialized.

Integrability,"See the ScatterIntervals and related tasks in the gCNV WDLs at the link above. The idea is to performs multiple runs of gCNV in shards of >10,000 intervals each across the exome. These shards can be specified by passing the set of intervals for each shard via the -L argument to GermlineCNVCaller. The gCNV model is independently fit in each shard, using the global depth and contig-level ploidy parameters determined across the whole exome in the DetermineGermlineContigPloidy step. The shards are then stitched together in the PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls step. I believe we typically run shards of 10,000 intervals for cohorts of 100-200 samples using n1-standard-8 machines, which have 30GB of memory (although looking at some recent runs, I think we've used as few as 5,000 intervals per shard).

Integrability,"Some questions before this is code reviewed in detail:. 1) A number of query methods in GoogleGenomicsReadAdapter adapter; throw if the corresponding field is not present in the underlying read. For some; of these there are guard methods you can call to avoid this (see for example; the changes in ReadUtils.java), but for some of the others I'm not sure how to; usefully query the state without already knowing the answer, ie.:. -isSupplementaryAlignment; -isSecondaryAlignment,; -failsVendorQualityCheck; -isDuplicate; -mateIsReverseStrand. To have fidelity with SAMRecord.getSAMString , we need to be able to query these; (as does ReadUtils.getFlags, which has a similar problem, but I changed that to; use guard methods to prevent throwing). In a couple of cases I had to change; the Read adapter to not throw. We need to figure out if this kind; of change is ok. or what the alternative is. 2) This is incidental to this PR, but there are a few inconsistencies between how; GenomicsConverter.makeSAMRecord and ReadUtils compute derived state values, ie. flags.; I can work around these in the getSAMString tests (I'm using Read->SAMRecord; conversions to validate the tests), but the underlying format conversions; are inconsistent. Should we align them ?. For example, GenomicsConverter sets the firstInPair flag on the SAMRecord if readNumber==0,; even if numberOfReads==1, whereas the ReadUtils/GoogleReadAdapter requires readNumber==0; and numberOfReads==2. Likewise the unmapped flag is determined differently: Genomics converter: (http://google-genomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/migrating_tips.html):; final boolean unmapped = (read.getAlignment() == null || ; read.getAlignment().getPosition() == null || ; read.getAlignment().getPosition().getPosition() == null);; ReadUtils:; private boolean positionIsUnmapped( final Position position ) {; return position == null ||; position.getReferenceName() == null || position.getReferenceName().equals(SAMRecord.NO_ALIGNMENT_REFERENCE_NAME) ||; ",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/871:114,adapter,adapter,114,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/871,2,['adapter'],['adapter']

Integrability,"Still not sure why the tests failed randomly! all XHMM-related tests use their own RNG with fixed seeds and there are no RNG calls in any parallel streams. Therefore, the randomly generated test data must be identical and fully deterministic across all runs. However, it did not appear to be the case! some test runs triggered a bug in HMMPostProcessor (see below) and some runs didn't. I removed a few unnecessary RNGs and the issue is not reproducible anymore. In particular, both XHMMModel and XHMMEmissionProbabilityCalculator had their own RNG but then again, if the tests are run in a deterministic order, it shouldn't matter. The good news is the bug in HMMPostProcessor is fixed; the bad news is, I still don't know why the tests were not deterministic. I bet the failing issue is (magically!) fixed as a result of pulling out the RNG from XHMMModel and XHMMEmissionProbabilityCalculator. If it occurs again, I'll investigate more. - fixed a bug in HMMPostProcessor that required all samples to be queried in the given list of genotyping segments every time (origin of the failing tests: sometimes the randomly generated genotyping segments contained fewer samples than all samples available for genotyping); - got rid of the unnecessary RNG in XHMMModel to make it stateless (sampling requires an external RNG); - also made XHMMEmissionProbabilityCalculator stateless (sampling requires an external RNG); - truncated the target list used in XHMM integration tests (cuts down the test time by a factor of 10)",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3140:1455,integrat,integration,1455,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3140,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Integrability,"Summary of changes:. - Fixed a minor issue in sampling error estimation that could lead to NaN (as a result of division by zero). - Introduced separate _internal_ and _external_ admixing rates. The _internal_ admixing rate is to be used internally by discrete RV posterior update routines (""callers"") as a safety measure to stabilize self-consistency loops. For example, consider the mean-field treatment of two coupled Markov chains: the mean-field decoupling of the two chains yields two independent Markov chains with effective emission, transition, and prior probabilities, all of which must be self-consistency determined. The internal admixing rate would be used to admix the old and new self-consistent fields across the two chains in order to dampen oscillations and improve convergence properties. Once internal convergence is achieved, the converged posteriors must be saved to a workspace in order to be consumed by the continuous sub-model. The new internally converged posteriors will be admixed with the old internally converged posteriors from the previous epoch with the _external_ admixing rate. - Introduced two-stage inference for cohort denoising and calling. In the first (""warm-up"") stage, discrete variables are marginalized out, yielding an effective continuous-only model. The warm-up stage calculates continuous posteriors based on the marginalized model. Once convergence is achieved, continuous and discrete variables are decoupled for the second (""main"") stage. The second stage starts with a discrete calling step (crucial), using continuous posteriors from the warm-up stage as the starting point. The motivation behind the two-stage inference strategy is to avoid getting trapped in spurious local minima that are potentially introduced by mean-field decoupling of discrete and continuous RVs. Note that mean-field decoupling has a tendency to stabilize local minima, most of which will disappear or turn into saddle points once correlations are taken into account.

Integrability,"TargetCodec is dependent on the old htsjdk indexing scheme whereby the indexer called readActualHeader on the codec first (for the side effect of initializing the codec header state), and then manually processed the feature file contents by:. - re-creating the input SOURCE/stream a second time; - NOT calling readActualHeader; - extracting and passing the features one at a time to the codec's decode method, using the stream position to find the feature file offsets. Although this scheme worked with TargetCodec, it had several other failure modes (see https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/pull/906). With https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/pull/906, the SOURCE/stream is only opened once for indexing. However, TargetCodec uses an underlying CSVReader that automatically buffers input, which confounds the indexer. This PR works around that issue for indexing.

Integrability,"Thank you @kshakir. What I see there is that the code sets the default NIO option, and as part of this is creates a google cloud `StorageOptions` object. Sadly for us, when this object is created it determines which Google credentials to use, and if nothing was specified by the user it will send some network messages to try to figure out whether it's running on a Google Compute Engine machine. When we wrote the default-setting code we didn't realize that setting the number of retries was going to cause a network message to be sent, with the associated potential retries and delays. We can't change the way Google Compute Engine works, or how the Google authentication works either. Ideally we'd want some way to only search for credentials when we know NIO is going to be used. The point of these defaults is that they're used for anything that uses NIO, including third-party library code. We can't fully replicate this behavior in a different way from the outside. So I think the ""correct"" fix would be to go deep inside the Google NIO library and change it so that instead of providing a default configuration (that the user would have to put together, causing the problem you've seen), we can provide a *callback* that sets the configuration when the Google Cloud NIO provider is loaded. This is harder for future developers to wrap their heads around, but at least it would prevent this delay if NIO is not used. I'd like to think about this some more before doing something quite this drastic, though.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3491#issuecomment-443837504:310,message,messages,310,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3491#issuecomment-443837504,3,"['message', 'wrap']","['message', 'messages', 'wrap']"

Integrability,"Thank you @mehrzads for your contribution. It would appear that this optimization is aimed to incorporate the knowledge that we could never possibly visit a given vertex more than K times in the first K best paths. Since the graphs are prone to exponential expansion of paths this seems like an important safeguard against this exponential expansion of the graph. . Looking at the code and the algorithm behavior it is intending to copy I see that there is a degenerate case in the current code that can cause the results to be order dependent. My belief is that this code can fall over by virtue of the fact that we refuse to make new incoming edges to a given vertex if there are already too many incoming edges for that vertex. Unfortunately this heuristic doesn't strike me as being valid, because those incoming edges can have any weight, including very high weights because they are bad paths through the graph that we created at a previous step. . I think a more correct optimization would be to limit the number of edges we create LEAVING a given vertex. The logic for this is that while we may not necessarily see all of the incoming edges in the correct weight order we will necessarily see all of the leaving edges in the correct order because those paths are pulled off of the priority queue in the correct order. Thus we can safely ignore any additional paths we see leaving a given edge because by construction as they would necessarily have at least one path that is cheaper than all of the paths leaving the current node.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5907#issuecomment-494105417:534,depend,dependent,534,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5907#issuecomment-494105417,1,['depend'],['dependent']

Integrability,"Thank you @vruano for your diligent review. I've implemented logger classes to encapsulate the metrics classes. Unfortunately the metrics classes must remain public in order to write output using `MetricsUtils.saveMetrics()`, but at least the tools aren't using them directly. There are two logging class groups - one for Filter and one Score. For Filter, there is an interface `PSFilterLogger` that is implemented by a file-logging class `PSFilterFileLogger` and a dummy class `PSFilterEmptyLogger` that does nothing. There are analogous classes for Score, but there is no Empty logger because it's not actually necessary. This adds a lot of new classes (maybe you can think of a better way) but usage has been greatly simplified. As we discussed in person, I don't think there is a faster way to count the reads in Spark. If you wanted to count the reads as they pass through, you would have to use some kind of atomic type that would be slow. Also it may be impossible to account for cases when tasks fail and restart. @lbergelson @droazen In this PR, I wanted to use htsjdk's MetricsFile and MetricBase classes for writing metrics to a file. I notice that these classes are mostly used for picard-related things. Is this the preferred way to do things?

Integrability,"Thank you, sir. In fact , firstly I called SNP from both parents respectively, and then combined both parents vcf files to a integrate vcf file, I want to get maternal different homozygous SNP compare to reference genome and paternal different homozygous SNP compare to reference genome, and combined both parents SNPs to a integrate biSNP.vcf file ,and then filtered heterozygote sites. Finally I submited this integrate biSNP.vcf as a input file of argument ""sites"" of GATK-3.8 ASEReaderCounter, l got normal output file of ASE reads count. But if I used argument ""variants"" of GATK-4.0 to replace ""sites"" argument of GATK-3.8, other files were not changed, it reminded me that ""the SNP site of inupt file is not het"" , so I got null result file in the end,because l filtered integrate vcf file, all SNP sites of different parents are homozygote compare to reference genome.

Integrability,"Thanks @davidbenjamin. . For what it is worth, here are some of my thoughts. From my perspective, it might helpful to separate the discussion into read likelihood calculation and the genotype likelihood calculation. As I understand it, sequencing error is directly relevant to the pairHMM read likelihood calculation. I guess the location where PCR error is most relevant (read likelihood vs genotype likelihood) would depend on whether the read likelihood is computing a ""fragment likelihood"" (the likely DNA sequence of the fragment being sequenced) or a ""haplotype likelihood"" (the likely source haplotype for the fragment being sequenced). In any case, as I see it, this particular issue could be interpreted as a shortcoming in only the HaplotypeCaller genotype likelihood calculation, and it would essentially be an issue of double counting. So I'm not sure that a quick fix for this issue is necessarily off the table...Maybe something like one of the following could be used just before or during the genotype likelihood calculation:; - something like `filterOverlappingReads` from Mutect2 (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/walkers/mutect/SomaticGenotypingEngine.java#L326); - separate consideration of overlapping reads when calculating genotype likelihoods, as used in UnifiedGenotyper (https://github.com/broadgsa/gatk-protected/blob/aa8764d6c3de146856b174a8674fa787a6311d7c/protected/gatk-tools-protected/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/gatk/tools/walkers/genotyper/DiploidSNPGenotypeLikelihoods.java#L183). As I see it, #4958, which seems to be more related to read likelihood calculation, is where a more involved solution, with more fundamental changes, might be warranted. From my perspective (not being especially familiar with the pairHMM model), an ideal solution would transition the pairHMM from read likelihood to a ""fragment likelihood"" or ""haplotype likelihood"" when information from read pairs is available,",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5436#issuecomment-443558420:419,depend,depend,419,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5436#issuecomment-443558420,1,['depend'],['depend']
Integrability,"Thanks @droazen & @ldgauthier. I can certainly run a bunch more iterations of the same HC run on the same data. I'm not super hopeful it will turn anything up though. I can also try selecting a bunch of the different PairHMM implementations. I can't share too much, but this issue turned up in a very high throughput (1000s of samples a day) clinical pipeline. We're going back and looking for other instances where we see an excess of that `Annotation will not be calculated, genotype is not called or alleleLikelihoodMap is null` message, and re-running those samples to see if, on re-run, they generate different outputs. I realize the AVX-specific hardware issue is perhaps a little far-fetched, though given the volume of the pipeline and the fact that it runs in a cloud environment, I think it's entirely reasonable to suspect we'll run into hardware/instance issues occasionally. And there are AVX or at least SIMD specific registers, so if one of those were to see problems that could cause the PairHMM issues, without causing issues in other software that doesn't leverage the SIMD/AVX instructions. My main question really is this: is anyone familiar enough with the Intel PairHMM implementation and interface that they could weigh in on whether or not unexpected hardware errors could result in the return of empty likelihoods from the PairHMM instead of some kind of error, exception or segfault?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6889#issuecomment-709555915:532,message,message,532,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6889#issuecomment-709555915,2,"['interface', 'message']","['interface', 'message']"

Integrability,"Thanks @droazen. Because you assigned it to me, I would like to know a couple of details on how this should be implemented in GATK4:. * GATK3 use to have a the `MisencodedBaseQualityReadTransformer` always on, with a switch for checking/fixing the qualities. If we follow this approach in GATK, the only change for this is to include the checking step every n reads and then #2160 will do the rest. Nevertheles, I think that it's quite dangerous to allow an user to disable it with the plugin (because the name suggest that it is only fixing the qualities), so I suggest to integrate in the read data source an iterator for checking every x reads if the qualities are misencoded, independently on the transformer.; * GATK3 throws an UserException for ""putatively misencoded"" qualities, using 60 as maximum base quality for throwing. I think that in the case of GATK4 could be more useful to use a warning if it is over 60 (I do not know what is the reasoning behind this value), and use `SAMUtils.MAX_PHRED_SCORE` for throwing.

You can see the results [here](https://travis-ci.org/broadinstitute/gatk/jobs/221534229). - The main issue is that GenomicsDB fails to load. This causes the importer tests to fail, as well as the existing GenomicsDB integration tests. (Note that the importer tests fail with a null pointer exception, but that problem is secondary and only happens when the db fails to load, which is the root problem.) We can fix the NPE in code review, for now the main issue is fix the core problem of why genomics db fails to load. - The changes in OptionalVariantInputArgumentCollection and RequiredVariantInputArgumentCollection are causing argument name collisions in other tools, which is why ExampleIntervalWalkerIntegrationTest tests are failing in this branch. The simplest fix in the short term is to just revert the changes you made to those two classes, and remove the new VariantInputArgumentCollection class.

Integrability,"Thanks @lbergelson! I agree that it might be good to break into more layers—could be worth talking to SV team and seeing what lessons they learned in putting together their hierarchy of images. Also, note that I pushed the install of miniconda into the base, but I did not push down the setup of the GATK conda environment itself (which takes the bulk of the time during the main-image build, as it requires lots of downloading). I think I commented elsewhere that a good strategy might be to set up the conda environment with the non-GATK python dependencies in the base, and then update the environment via a pip install of the GATK python packages in the main image. This would let us make python code changes without having to rebuild the base, but might require a bit of scripting to create a final yml for non-Docker users.

Integrability,"Thanks a lot for looking into this @sooheelee - I understand the pain of making the small data for the tests, so I really appreciate your work there. I have almost prepare a PR for the new port of `RealignerTargetCreator` that will have TODOs for the test data prepared by you, and with some tests using files already in the repository (for the target-creator, I guess that the validation for getting the regions to realign would be enough, because thanks to that tests I realized of a small bug due to not including all the loci in the `LocusWalker`). On the other hand, I will still fight for the `--nWayOut` not blocking the inclusion of `IndelRealigner` in the first place. My reasons are the following:; ; 1. Looking a bit into the code of GATK3, there is a lot of complication to get the reader ID for each read. It will require to modify the `GATKRead` interface, the data source for reads, or find an *ad hoc* solution on `IndelRealignment` to set the procedence of the read. This requires going into the engine-level code, which in my experience is difficult to port from GATK3 and also slow on the reviewing/acceptance process.; 1. My idea for developing a new writer of general use as the n-way output (which can be used in other tools as well) is to factor out some code from `SplitReads` to have a custom `GATKReadWriter` for arbitrary splitting. i'm already using a similar solution on `ReadTools`, so backporting the code to GATK might be a solution. Nevertheless, this still requires that the `GATKRead` has somehow the identity store at the object level, which requires to address point 1.; 1. The use case of the tumor-normal pair can be resolved by an extra processing step (split by read group). I understand that it is quite convenient to add this argument, but I would suggest that until it can be develop.; 1.

I might include more detail with the note (""Substantially improves results on FFPE samples""), for posterity---it's probably true, but we can't really say anything definitive with only N=1 and without the cross-validation procedure I mentioned on Slack. That is, the higher degree of denoising might just be an artifact of effectively removing more PCs with GC-bias correction (since I'm assuming the same number of PCs were explicitly removed in both cases), but it's possible that removing the optimal number of PCs without GC-bias correction could achieve a better result.

From a user perspective though, it might be beneficial to report the first occurrence of this error, as that's most likely where I would go back to do future testing & troubleshooting. That being said, all of the overlapping intervals are already outputted to stderr, so all the information is retained regardless, and I could just look through the logs to find that first problematic interval. As an aside, I find it a bit weird that the overlapping interval message shows up as a _warning_ even when using the `-no-overlaps` option (I would assume it would be an error, not a warning). In my experience, most errors cause the program to quit immediately. So, perhaps instead, if this warning were an _error_ when using the `-no-overlaps` option, the program would stop after the first occurrence of this error... and then the error message would be accurate. Maybe that was the original intent of this code. But, again, if that requires much more testing & changes, when a quick rewording would also suffice, there's no need.

Integrability,"Thanks for the review and running those tests, @ldgauthier! Will restore the aforementioned GnarlyGenotyperIntegrationTests and update a few other exact matches in the rebase this afternoon. You also asked above if there was a theoretical reason to change the threshold. Since it seems the original was relatively arbitrary (at least from what I've been told, happy to be corrected), I think we can leave it. The new annotation is strictly larger, so we will then be slightly more conservative about keeping sites if we leave the threshold fixed. You can think of this as a slight change in the decision boundary in genotype-count space---perhaps I can add some plots to this thread this afternoon to demonstrate. In practice, what we care about is whether: 1) many sites flicker across the change in boundary after hard filtering, and/or 2) these sites result in discrepancies post-VQSR. I think the tests you ran suggest that we don't need to worry much about the second issue, and I can take a closer look later to check about the first (which will depend simply on the number of samples and the allele frequency spectrum).

Because transformers could be kind of demanding in computation, it will be interesting to pass directly to them filtered reads.

Integrability,"Thanks very much for your analysis. Job 4 does create a lot of garbage, but that appears to be inevitable whenever you are dealing with a PairRDD: You have to use a Tuple2 to represent key and value rather than using a more memory-conservative custom data object. You end up with a gazillion tiny objects that survive only during the shuffle. Too bad they didn't base PairRDD on an interface like Map.Entry. Also too bad that you cannot force a shuffle on a (plain old, non-Pair) RDD. Why not just treat it as a key-only structure and allow repartitioning? I mention this not merely to whine, but also in the faint hope that you've developed some helpful workarounds. I don't think we have enough memory to persist the reads, but we can revisit that later.

We can delete it for the time being if you think it'll cause confusion.; - Correct, I think the import statement for `reshape` in BQSR.R was always incorrect/extraneous. `reshape2` is the correct dependency for `ggplot2` (which is itself imported), and `reshape` is not explicitly used in BQSR.R. So to recap: I removed the installation of this unnecessary package, but failed to remove an unnecessary import statement since it was in an untested code path, which was then caught when users tried to run the tool. Investigation of this issue then revealed that `ggplot2` was not installed correctly in the current base image, due to a completely unrelated dependency issue.; - Good call on clearing the Travis cache.

Integrability,"Thanks, but I’m still not sure I understand. Haplotypecaller has the following parameters:. . Assembly-region-padding. Interval-padding. . The differences and relationships between these are not well documented on the gatk website. From what you describe below, it would seem to suggest that assembly-region-padding is doing what interval-padding is doing. But then why would there be multiple settings for the same thing?. . I just want to make sure that Assembly-region-padding is indeed adding intervals to the -L interval list itself, not just to the assembled regions. .

This is controlled by the --assembly-region-padding argument, which defaults to 100 bases on either side. Note that this controls both padding around user-provided intervals, as well as padding around each individual assembly region that the HaplotypeCaller discovers. Typically a single user interval will get divided into many assembly regions, depending on where variant activity is located. —; You are receiving this because you were mentioned.; Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6071#issuecomment-517387946:1346,depend,depending,1346,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6071#issuecomment-517387946,1,['depend'],['depending']

Integrability,"That is a separate matter altogether from both 1) unifying the allele-count collection tools, and 2) standardizing the format of tabular data. The most appropriate place for integration of Mutect2 SNV calls would be as input to the tumor-heterogeneity tool (along with the ModelSegments output) further downstream. This is because it is unlikely that including the SNVs as input to ModelSegments would significantly improve either segmentation or modeling there. If the allele-count collection tools are unified, I think that the only redundant work done across both pipelines would be the calling of hets from the pileups, which is extremely cheap.

We've seen this happen when the CNN Python inference code runs out of memory. It would be better to have the exception handler write the exception string directly to the ack FIFO, with a message length included, so the controller can deterministically retrieve the message for inclusion in the java exception without having to rely on std in/out.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5100:494,message,message,494,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5100,3,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"The advantage of using SLF4J is that it is a general facade, so it makes simpler to change for one logging system to other if the bound is implemented. For the most common logging systems (log4j, jul, JLC, etc.), there are this implementation and even no-op logging. One of the nice things from slf4j is that it allows to use the logging format set by the software to every library dependency, controlling the verbosity of other libraries too. . After having a look to the gradle dependencies, it seems that ADAM and Spark use slf4j. This will allow better integration with the two libraries: now the `slf4-jdk` is completely removed, and I don't know if this will blow up at some point if some of the ADAM/Spark classes try to load them. In addition, it will make GATK4 more general. Regarding features, I'm not using more that what log4j is providing, but I'm quite familiar with logback and I have a bias to use it if possible, but the GATK framework as it is implemented now ""force"" to use log4j. But anyway, I'm happy also with using log4j and I was only suggesting this for make GATK4 more general (and to come back in my work to logback, but that is just personal taste). @lbergelson, feel free to close the issue.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2176#issuecomment-259211054:382,depend,dependency,382,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2176#issuecomment-259211054,6,"['depend', 'integrat']","['dependencies', 'dependency', 'integration']"

In addition, the separation between normal tools and spark-tools will make easier for downstream projects to support or not spark in their code.; * `experimental`: this might contain prototype code that might change in the future, and that will be nice in terms of documentation purposes (always annotated with `@BetaFeature` or `@Experimental`, etc.).

Integrability,"The fact that `ReadCoordinateComparator` does not exactly match the ordering of htsjdk's `SAMRecordCoordinateComparator` has been the cause of a few bugs. It sorts all unmapped reads after mapped reads, whereas `SAMRecordCoordinateComparator` sorts unmapped reads that are assigned the positions of their mapped mates with their mapped mates. The issue is that the `GATKRead` interface does not allow unmapped reads to have a position. Ie., even if an unmapped `SAMRecord` is assigned the position of its mapped mate, calling `getContig()`/`getStart()` on the unmapped read via the `GATKRead` interface will return `null`/`0`. This was done mainly for consistency reasons and to simplify client code. Perhaps we could add `getAssignedContig()`, `getAssignedStart()`, etc. methods to GATKRead to expose the positions that unmapped reads with mapped mates get assigned for sorting purposes, and use these in `ReadCoordinateComparator`.

Integrability,"The two main resources limiting how many gVCFs you can import at once will be memory and file handles. . I'm not sure if you mean incremental import or batch size when you mention the iterative approach. I assume the latter, but just want to clarify that there isn't any reason to break up the import using incremental import. The batch size parameter effectively does that, so you might as well import all gVCFs you have available (optionally using batch size if you're running out of memory). I'll throw out batch sizes of 50 or 100 as being reasonable, but the size of the intervals being imported will make a difference. It would be best to try to monitor how much memory is being used with those settings.

This is a little more complicated, since I now realize that MKL is not actually fully utilized (if at all) in our conda environment. For example, we `pip install numpy`, rather than `conda install` a version from the `default` channel that is compiled against MKL.

Integrability,"There were a couple of things I needed to do to get the new Spark code running on a cluster:. i. Go back to using Spark's version of Kryo. Using a different version of Kryo is not actually needed (2.21 used by Spark passes the tests), and actually caused errors on the cluster when run with `--conf spark.driver.userClassPathFirst=true` (which is needed to avoid other library conflicts, like with jopt-simple). ii. Exclude Spark from the JAR file to avoid library conflicts. It's normal to exclude Spark and Hadoop from JAR files since they are supplied by `spark-submit`. Since Gradle doesn't have a 'provided' dependency (see https://github.com/broadinstitute/hellbender/issues/836), I had to do a bit of a workaround with the `shadowJar` target, which is now `sparkJar`. .

Integrability,"These are a bunch of random, mostly just annoying things that I repeatedly encountered during the Java 17 port that we should look into. . **Log Spam Issues:** (these result in lots of error log spam that make the logs super hard to scan when there is a failure):. - The WDL test logs are riddled with “localization by hard link failed” and ""Docker not found"" failures, which makes it hard to scan them for real failures. Can we eliminate/fix these ?; - The logs have a few gradle task dependency warnings - we should hunt down the cause. ; - We routinely pull ~800 branches every time we run git clone for a CI job. Can we do shallow git clones?; - We're using deprecated gradle features that result in warnings in the logs, these should be updated.; - The test runner seems to serialize (via toString) every argument to every test method. Many of these have *huge* ""toString"" representations (i.e., `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.tools.spark.sv.integration.ExtractOriginalAlignmentRecordsByNameSparkIntegrationTest`) that fill the logs with reams of huge test values. We should codify/unify the test case wrapper class that we use in htsjdk for these cases. . **Other Issues:**. - We should review the shadowJar contents - it includes some surprising stuff (i.e., the publish-picard.sh script we use to publish picard).; - Do we still need the unpacktestjar task in `dockertest.gradle`, to work around testNG inability to find tests in a jar ?; - The test matrix job names all look the same in the github UI because only the first N characters are displayed, and they all have the same prefix. We should rename them so they start with unique prefixes.; - The library it.unimi.dsi:fastutil:7.0.61 appears to not be used [Fix] (reported in IntelliJ/Project Structure/Problems).; - It's non-intuitive that the *Dockerfile* builds the `run_unit_tests.sh` script.

Integrability,"This PR addresses required changes in order to use latest version of GenomicsDB which exposes new functionality such as:; - [Multi interval import and query support](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3269):; - We create multiple arrays (directories) in a single workspace - one per interval. So, if you wish to import intervals (""chr1"", [ 1, 100M ]) and (""chr2"", [ 1, 100M ]), you end up with 2 directories/arrays in the workspace with names chr1$1$100M and chr2$1$100M. The array names depend on the partition bounds.; - During the read phase, the user only supplies the workspace. The array names are obtained by scanning the entries in the workspace and reading the right arrays. For example, if you wish to read (""chr2"", [ 50, 50M] ), then only the second array is queried.; - In the previous version of the tool, the array name was a constant - _genomicsdb_array_. The new version will be backward compatible with respect to reads. Hence, if a directory named _genomicsdb_array_ is found in the workspace directory, it's passed as the array for the _GenomicsDBFeatureReader_ otherwise the array names are generated from the directory entry names.; - Parallel import based on chromosome intervals. The number of threads to use can be specified as an integer argument to the [executeImport call](https://github.com/francares/gatk/blob/fmc_GenomicsDB_parallel_import/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/genomicsdb/GenomicsDBImport.java#L535). If no argument is specified, the number of threads is determined by Java's ForkJoinPool (typically equal to the \#cores in the system). ; - The max number of intervals to import in parallel can be controlled by the command line argument --max-num-intervals-to-import-in-parallel (default 1); - Note that increasing parallelism increases the number of FeatureReaders opened to feed data to the importer. So, if you are using _N_ threads and your batch size is _B_, you will have _N*B_ feature readers open.; - Protobuf based API fo",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4645:499,depend,depend,499,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4645,1,['depend'],['depend']

Records are reported only for the upstream read in the pair. The second file contains the locations of all soft clips in the input file, including the coordinate and ""direction"" (right or left clipping) and the count of the number of reads clipped at that position and direction. The integration test expected results file was generated using `svtk collect-pesr` to help ensure that the results are identical.

Integrability,"This PR fixes two bugs. First, the SplitIntervals task would enter WeightedSplitIntervals and hang. I added an extra boolean argument to extract so you can specify that no, you really don't want to use a weighted bed. Relatedly, the code branch for running the original GATK SplitIntervals code wasn't correct, as passing weight-bed-file to it as an argument caused a failure. It uses a slightly hacky method of defining a string in WDL to be empty or not depending on if we use weighted beds, interpolating that string into the bash, then checking to see if it's empty there to transmit that state. There is likely a cleaner way to do this, and in the next revision I will likely rewrite this part cleaner. Second, after SplitIntervals passed we hit an error during ExtractTask. The way it expanded intervals to handle large deletions could sometimes subtract past the start of a chromosome, so that logic needed to be patched in a few separate places to handle the interval for the mitochondrial dna that started much closer to the beginning (instead of having a 10k base pair buffer).

It introduces the concept of an evidence-target link, which joins an evidence interval to its distal target. This is an extension of the 'coherent' evidence concept previously used in determining evidence thresholds for assembly. The code in this PR contains the following changes:. - Evidence intervals and distal targets now are treated as stranded, and evidence-target link clustering depends on overlaps between both intervals and strands.; - Evidence target interval and distal target interval calculations have been modified to make sure that evidence supporting the same event clusters together (has overlapping intervals). This includes several changes such as extending the 'rest-of-fragment-size' calculation to try to capture almost all non-outlier fragment sizes in the library; increasing the split read location uncertainty a little; and being more precise about the boundaries of distal target intervals by taking advantage of information in the MD and MC tags if available.; - Evidence target links are gathered for every piece of evidence supporting a high-quality distal target. ; - Evidence target links are clustered together and store the amount of split-read and read-pair evidence that went into each cluster.; - All evidence target link clusters that are composed of at least 1 split read or at least 2 read pairs are collected in the driver and emitted in a BEDPE formatted file specified in the command line parameters.; - A `PairedStrandedIntervalTree` data structure is introduced to allow `SVIntervalTree`-style lookups for paired intervals. To finish this work, future PRs will 1) use the collected evidence target links to annotate our assembly called-variants with the number of split reads and read pairs observed in the original mappings and 2) create IMPRECISE VCF records for events that have enough evidence-target-link support, first for deletions and then possibl",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3469:487,depend,depends,487,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3469,1,['depend'],['depends']

Integrability,"This PR reimplements the overlap detector used in WeighedSplitIntervals in a much faster form for our particular use case. It also involved preprocessing the weighted bed input file in a new way, so the previous weights files will no longer work.

I pulled down the documentation and rationale for the original process from the git issue to a markdown file that can live in our repo, and made python scripts out of the necessary bits of python logic there (as well as a new one to do the further preprocessing step that I added). The motivation for this was the inability of the previous WeightedSplitIntervals task to complete when run against an exome interval list. This new one does, and it does so quickly.

Integrability,"This code wraps around BaseRecalibrator and presents a very basic interface (set up, add reads, teardown) that's going to be used at each Dataflow worker. Challenges here:; (1) I need to convert the intervals to Features because that's what the BaseRecalibrator class uses, and SimpleInterval is not a subclass of Feature. This may change in the future.; (2) BaseRecalibrator takes Features as inputs - the only simple Feature class I found I could reuse is ArtificialTestFeature. Please let me know if there is a better choice (solving (1) also solves this); (3) I didn't find code to test overlap between a SimpleInterval and a Feature. Rather than roll my own I chose to use the SimpleInterval overlap test and convert to Feature lazily instead of eagerly. This may cause an interval to be converted more than once.

Currently, GenomicsDB would create a separate folder/partition for each contig and this slows down import to a crawl with a large number of contigs. . To use this feature, users should set the flag `--merge-contigs-into-num-partitions` to the number of partitions. Using the feature requires that entire contigs be passed as input intervals -- we don't support merging together an interval list that contains partial contigs. . There's no magic threshold where this would start to be useful - we currently warn users when they specify more than 100 intervals, and I think the same threshold makes sense for when they should consider using this flag. Choosing the right value for `--merge-contigs-into-num-partitions` would be dependent on amount of parallelism users want to use (for example, do they want to want to import using `max-num-intervals-to-import-in-parallel`). If no parallelism is envisioned either on import or query, setting `--merge-contigs-into-num-partitions` to `1` should work as well -- though the user may find it more reassuring to break up the work into more partitions just so you can see some progress being made....",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6681:1089,depend,dependent,1089,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6681,1,['depend'],['dependent']

Integrability,"This is an experiment to see if it's possible to run BWA-MEM on Spark. (Please don't merge.)

It would be great to get your (and @akiezun's) feedback on the direction here. A few comments; - Building the native libraries is not integrated, and it's not using the Apache 2 licensed code. I think this could use some of the changes in #1701.; - The ref is assumed to be on the local FS for the moment - it should really be loaded from HDFS. Also, the output is a single SAM file on the local FS, not a sharded BAM as for the rest of the GATK Spark tools.; - It is assumed that read pairs are interleaved and reads in a pair are placed in the same split (by setting `hadoopbam.bam.keep-paired-reads-together`). However, that property only works for queryname sorted BAMs, which isn't the case here, so we need to relax that requirement in Hadoop-BAM.; - I haven't tried this on large inputs, so I don't know how well it performs.

The interesting bit is the use of Spark's `--archives` flag to copy a tarball of native libraries (which I built manually) to every executor, and unpacks it in the working directory. Then `spark.executor.extraLibraryPath` is set to add that path to the library path of the executor.

The combine is more efficient than the others since it can run on the map side, reducing the amount of data that goes through the shuffle. I think it may be possible to merge the processing of the fragments and the reads to eliminate a shuffle - so there are only two shuffles for the main transform.

Integrability,"This issue has come up during my work on #6634 and has resulted in the decision to introduce a new argument to GATK `--use-original-alignments-for-genotyping-overlap` in order to better match DRAGEN for concordance. Reads in the GATK undergo a number of modifications before they are used for genotyping that I have listed down below. (Note: between each of these steps some reads get lost to various filtering code and this is not an exhaustive list). 1. Reads undergo modification in `AssemblyBasedCallerUtils.finalizeRegion()` where the reads have their soft-clipped bases reverted, low quality ends removed, mate overlapping base qualities modified, and overhangs outside of the active region removed. Then these reads are used for assembly to discover haplotypes. ; 2. Once we have discovered haplotypes the whole assembly region (reads, haplotypes and all) gets trimmed down to a smaller span that ~overlaps the variants discovered the haplotypes plus either 75+ or 20 bases of padding depending on what type of events are seen. ; 3. These clipped reads (with reads below 10 bases in length being removed) have their base qualities farther modified in `PairHMMLikelihoodCalculationEngine.createQualityModifiedRead()` in various ways. This modification does not stick however since the base qualities are all modified on a clean partial copy of the read.; 4. Following this the reads (the ones from step 2) are realigned to the reference according to their best haplotypes. Sometimes this means as few as 11 bases of ""read"" are being realigned at this stage. . It is these realigned reads that are used for genotyping, where the only reads that are actually used to contribute likelihoods for calls are reads that overlap the variant event within 2 bases of overlap on either side. In DRAGEN they do something different that we had to replicate to achieve concordance. Dragen still performs equivalent modifications for steps 1-3 as they apply to the reads but rather than performing step 4 and u",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6706:992,depend,depending,992,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6706,1,['depend'],['depending']

Integrability,"This should fix the travis failure by forcing lfs to overwrite the existing commit hooks. The issue seems to be this:. We install lfs in the first part of the travis build, and then we run a docker build and mount the git folder into it. Docker then installs lfs again. The problem is occurring because git lfs 3.1.1 which released 2 days ago changed the format of the pre-push and other git hooks. Then it throws an error when it's installed again and there are hooks that look different than it expects already in place. Running install with `--force` fixes it. The lfs devs actually have a system for ignoring these differences, but they forgot to update their list of allowed differences ( or however they match it) in 3.1.1. They then released 3.1.2 today which fixes this. In most cases this would fix the issue, except the git-lfs installed INSIDE the docker image is on an ancient version and never updates since the ancient image ubuntu is pegged to an out of date one. While the one in travis outside of docker gets updated to the most recent one. So we have to manually force this. We should probably also update our ubuntu image to a newer one.
