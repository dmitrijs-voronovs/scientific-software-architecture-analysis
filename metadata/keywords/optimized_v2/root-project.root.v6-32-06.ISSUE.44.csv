Performance,"T'` it will fail. That's what I mean when I say that by relying on `PYTHONPATH` only one version will work. > we need to continue to support using multiple ROOT versions with python, also outside conda. That is always possible, but it requires setup scripts. I'm usually talking here about the situation in which you do `yum install root`, and it should work out of the box, without any extra setup. Same for other distributions. This is already the case in Fedora, but they have to go through hoops to make it work, like using alternatives for `libPyROOT.so` in `/etc/alternatives`. That's what I'd like to address. > we must not run setup.py as part of a ROOT installation. This makes it much harder to do the right thing during installation in order for things to work properly. PyROOT is a python package afterall, so what's the problem in using Python's native methods of installation as part of `make install`?. > It would be great if import ROOT can auto-detect which libPython (python2 or python3) to load; that would take care of the multi-python case after source thisroot.sh. At the moment, `libPyROOT.so` can only work with either Python 2.x or 3.x, not both. We need to change compile-time checks into runtime checks to make the same library work with both Python 2.x and 3.x (there are many `#ifdef`s on the Python version, for example). Finally, `thisroot.sh` is totally evil and should be deprecated. It messes up the environment when sourcing it, by potentially removing things from the path that should not be removed. It also assumes things about how ROOT was installed, so if ROOT's libraries are not in `$ROOTSYS/lib` (e.g., if they are in `$ROOTSYS/lib64`, or `$ROOTSYS/root/lib` with `gnuinstall=ON`) the script won't work. It also uses a colon for separator in `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, which is separated by semicolons, among other problems. My advice to people is to just stop using the script. Anyway, this is all a digression from this PR.

Performance,"TLDR: `TTree* TMVA::DataSet::GetTree` is missing a call to `tree->ResetBranchAddresses()` at the end. The interesting bit is that `TBufferFile::ReadInt` is being used even-though all the variables in the example (and indeed all their corresponding branches) are floats. So the issue is that the address of the Int branch:; ```; *Br 0 :classID : classID/I *; ```; is still set to an address that uses to be on the stack (according to valgrind). How can it be possible, you may ask. Well ... looking at the result of `fOutputFile->ls("""")` we notice:; ```; ....; OBJ: TTree TestTree TestTree : 0 at: 0x5555555eae70; ```; **even before** the call to `fOutputFile.Get(""dataset/TestTree"");`. This means that at point the `TTree` is already in memory (and already setup) and this prior loading is the likely place of the setting of the address to a local variable. It turns out that the `TTree` is created in `TTree* TMVA::DataSet::GetTree` at `DataSet.cxx:628` and later we have:; ```; UInt_t cls;; ...; tree->Branch( ""classID"", &cls, ""classID/I"" );; ...; return tree;; }; ```; At which point the `tree` is returns pointing to a bunch of now invalid memory location.; Using:; ```; tree->ResetBranchAddresses();; return tree;; }; ```; solves the problem.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10010#issuecomment-2080153300:779,load,loading,779,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10010#issuecomment-2080153300,1,['load'],['loading']

Performance,"TNamedBranchProxy did not implement a Hash method.; Therefore when adding TNamedBranchProxy instances to the THashList dedicated to their bookkeping in TTreeReader TObject::Hash was used.; Unfortunately when trying to find the TNamedBranchProxies, their name was used and the hash was built differently by THashList (based on the name).; In order to fix this the following steps were taken.; - THashList was replaced by an unordered_map with names as keys and unique_ptr<TNamedBranchProxy> as values. The unique_ptr is used to automatically manage ownership.; - The methods of TTreeReader were adapted to use this new container as well as the code in TTreeReaderValue and TTreeReaderArray. A real usecase from CMS where the mass of the W boson is studied shows a significant speedup (30%).; The code uses TDataFrame and several nodes are created which read from the same branch in an input tree which holds weights in a collection.; This configuration stressed the performance degradation pattern fixed by this commit as it triggered multiple times the deserialisation of the ""weights branch"".

Performance,"Thank you for the clarification. I had a closer look to this. The problem resides in that, during the deserialization, `libROOTPythonizations` is loaded, which in turn triggers the loading of `libcppyy`. Both libraries are extension modules. During the module initialization of `libROOTPythonizations`, it calls into `libcppyy`, but the latter has not been initialized yet (it has not been imported as a module), which causes the error. This does not happen during `import ROOT`, where all the imports are properly done. What I can try to do is ensure `libcppyy` is imported during the initialization of `libROOTPythonizations`.

Performance,"Thanks Philippe. After further consideration, i think you're right. I had indeed been concerned about a possible deadlock, but i had thought; that it was probably ok because a similar change was working fine; in production. But (a), i had forgotten about the dlopen lock and (b),; they weren't exactly the same change. As i alluded to above, we didn't; want to have a custom patch to ROOT, so for production we address this; race by wrapping dlopen. But in that case, the core lock is acquired; _before_ the call to dlopen, not after. So, what is to be done?. There is probably only one code path in ATLAS that was giving us problems.; The Gaudi plugin manager was being used to load one of the POOL libraries; that happened to include ROOT dictionary information. I could; acquire the ROOT core lock around this (and one or two other places; where i known that Gaudi components may be loaded after event processing; starts). However, there are many other places where shared libraries; could potentially be loaded. While those probably don't matter...; the original bug here was quite opaque, taking several months; to completely track down. So i'm loathe to leave open any possibility; that it could bite us again. We could add locking within TClassTable. This is perhaps an attractive; way forward, as it should make it much easier to ensure that usages; of TClassTable are correct. A drawback is that is hard to then ensure; that we don't have something else that is also supposed to be protected; by the core mutex. Nevertheless, i could try to prepare a change; to do this if it sounds good. However, that's not the end of the problems. If this analysis is correct, then we _already_ have potential deadlock; problems, as there is nothing to prevent the initialization code of a; shared library (which can be arbitrary used code) from calling into ROOT; in a way that would acquire the core mutex. So code which would look; innocent to the user would have a chance of deadlocking.; I'm not sure ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071:679,load,load,679,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071,3,['load'],"['load', 'loaded']"

There is no point in keeping around a fully jitted RDF+TTreeCache if it won't be used any more. After the aforementioned step is completed, we might perhaps think about what can go wrong with used memory and what we can do about it. For example, suppose a workflow with N dataframes. For some reason we do not control (e.g. some Dask internals or something imposed by the infrastructure) the scheduling is such that all of them are alive until the end of the processing. Can we cap the memory used by the caches? For example we could just keep 1 buffer and assign it to the tree cache of the chain associated to the RDF pulled from the worker's rdfs cache before using that RDF to process data (effectively using 1 single cache).

It will be invoked concurrently, and will also take as argument the ""processing slot"" number the partial result belongs to; * passing `0` as `everyNEvents` parameter to `OnParameterUpdate[Slot]` makes it so that the callback is invoked just once [per slot] before starting the event loop",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1037#issuecomment-331721438:358,concurren,concurrently,358,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1037#issuecomment-331721438,4,['concurren'],['concurrently']

Performance,"The MemPoolForRooSets has two problems:. 1. Scaling issues: increasing memory and CPU consumption with; increasing number of arenas, becuase trying to allocate a new; non-overlapping arena often fails. 2. Amplification of memory leaks in user code:; If one of the elements in the arena leaks, the whole arena will; leak. Since each arena has 6000 elements, this means a leak of a; RooArgSet will be ampilfied by a factor 6000 in the worst case. This commit proposes a solution to the scaling/performance issues and; the leak amplification. Explained for the example for RooArgSet, the idea is to use each arena; 120 times because this is the size of RooArgSet in bytes. This can be; done while still having unique adresses for each RooArgSet:. 1. Keep a gap of 120 bytes between each RooArgSet; 2. When an address was used before, add one byte and in can be used; again. So at the cost of allocating 2x more memory per arena, we can reuse each; arena 120 times. Now, the good thing is that the interval of creating/deleting; RooArgSets is usually higher than 6000. So when reusing an arena; multiple times, they will eventually be filled only by leaking; RooArgSets if there is a leak. Meaning the leak amplification effect; should be gone. This was checked with the CMS Higgs combine toy fit example from the; Higgs combine tutorial. Without this commit, there is a GB-level leak; that can be clearly observed with `top`, but with this commit the leak; becomes negligible again. The PR is still kind of a draft PR. I will check with the bot if this solution works on all platforms and then continue improving the code. This should be backported together with https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7935.

Performance,"The _miss cache_, implemented in this pull request, implements an optimization when the TTreeCache fails to work. The miss cache will keep track of any branch that has been accessed; when there is a TTC miss, it automatically fetches the current basket for all active branches. This should have a worst case read size equal to the size of the file's cluster size, but potentially a significant savings in the number of IO operations. The latter is extremely useful if we're doing IO on high-latency links. This optimization works well for the ""trigger pattern,"" where the user may examine a number of branches and, when the event contents for those branches passes a particular filter, reads out the remaining branches. If there are 100 additional branches, this would do all reads in a single network round-trip as opposed to 100 round trips. The approach has served us well in CMS and been utilized as a layer on top of ROOT for about 3 years. Unfortunately, we must iterate through a set of branches and find the correct basket.

Performance,"The `RooVectorDataStore` had two different buffers to store the row data in: the so-called ""attached buffers"" and the ""native buffers"". The problem is that when external buffers are attached, the call to `RooVectorDataStore::get()` is not loading the native buffers anymore, which is breaking some code that assumes this, like `RooVectorDataStore::loadValues`, which is used in `RooDataSet::reduce`. This breaks the reduction of datasets with externally attached buffers, which breaks the copy constructor of the `RooNLLVar`. This commit suggests to always load both the native and attached buffers if `RooVectorDataStore::get()` is called. This has almost no performance overhead and is much safeter. Since this change fixes the copy constructor of the `RooNLLVar`, which is used when plotting the NLL, this commit fixes this JIRA ticket: https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-9752.

So first one initializes the generator with a pdf with a domain (xmin, xmax) and later changes the range in which numbers are actually sampled from (xmin, xmax) to (xmin1, xmax1) which is a sub-range of (xmin, xmax). For methods which do not support this functionality the only option is to change the domain and reinitialize the generator.

Performance,"The best way to decrease your runtime would be transferring the data you need onto a faster storage medium (i.e. a faster disk/drive such as an SSD, or connecting to a faster network for remote file access), or to use a compression algorithm with a higher compression ratio, possibly at the cost of the decompression rate. Changing the number of threads is unlikely to help, and in fact using too many threads may degrade performance if they make requests to different regions of your local storage.; N.B. If no '--threads' argument was provided this is 1, otherwise it is the minimum of the value provided and the number of threads your CPU can run in parallel. It is worth noting that - on shared systems or if running other heavy applications - the number of your own threads running at any time may be lower than the limit due to demand on the CPU. 3. The 'Real Time' is similar to 'CPU Time / number of threads' AND 'Compressed Throughput' is lower than expected for your storage medium:; This would imply that your CPU threads aren't decompressing data as fast as your storage medium can provide it, and so decompression is the bottleneck. The best way to decrease your runtime would be to utilise a system with a faster CPU, or make use use of more threads when running, or use a compression algorithm with a higher decompression rate such as LZ4, possibly at the cost of some extra file size. A note on caching:. If your data is stored on a local disk, the system may cache some/all of the file in memory after it is first read. If this is realistic of how your analysis will run - then there is no concern. However, if you expect to only read files once in a while - and as such the files are unlikely to be in the cache - consider clearing the cache before running rootreadspeed.

Performance,"The distributed RDataFrame constructor accepts an optional `npartitions` keyword argument. Previously, if this argument was provided by the user, it set the number of partitions in which the rdf would split the distributed computations.; But then, right before starting the execution, the distributed backend implementation tried to optimize this number. In the case of Spark, an educated guess for the number of partitions would be spark.executor.instances * spark.executor.cores, that is the number of distributed nodes times the number of cores used for each node.; If we let this optimization happen just before the start of the execution, it means we completely disregard the user provided value for `npartitions`. Instead, the backend guessing at a number of partitions should happen only if the user doesn't supply one.; This commit addresses the issue by moving the call to `backend.optimize_npartitions` inside the initialization of the distributed dataframe object, plus adds a couple of tests to check the behaviour in the Spark backend.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7841:333,optimiz,optimize,333,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7841,2,['optimiz'],"['optimization', 'optimize']"

Performance,"The idea of the RooGenProdProj is that we divide two integral objects; each created with this makeIntgral() function to get the normalized; integral of a product. Therefore, we don't need to normalize the; numerater and denominator integrals themselves. Doing the normalization; would be expensive and it would cancel out anyway. However, if we don't; specify an explicit normalization integral in createIntegral(), the; last-used normalization set might be used to normalize the pdf,; resulting in redundant computations. For this reason, the normalization set of the integrated pdfs is fixed; to an empty set in this case. Note that in RooFit, a nullptr; normalization set and an empty normalization set is not equivalent. The; former implies taking the last-used normalization set, and the latter; means explicitly no normalization. This fixes the performance regression reported in https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11814, and a new unit; test is implemented to make sure no new numeric integrals pop up in the; reproducer code to that issue.

Motivation for the change can be found below, copy-pasted from the commit message. This will make future backports a bit of a pain, but I think it's worth doing it now, for the following reasons:; * we are at a historical low of RDF-related open bugs -> less backports are expected in the future; * recent large refactorings in RAction.hxx (#6220) and in the column reader logic (#6170) already make backports much less likely to apply cleanly to release branches, so if there is a less bad time to do this, it's probably now; * expected upcoming refactorings necessary to support bulk entry processing will put another nail in the coffin of backportable bug-fixes; * I think we can all agree that RCustomColumn is a terribly opaque name for something that at this point we all know as a ""Define"", and in a few years I'd rather not have doctoral students complain about how my class names are completely arbitrary and unnecessarily hard to understand .

Performance,"The main drawback of the ""temporary hack"" is that there is some duplication of information and operations now between the size of the vector and separate integer data members in the class which were previously needed to keep track of the size of the arrays. If migrating from bare arrays to ```std::vector``` to allow the compiler to autogenerate the constructors is the preferred solution (rather than implementing them by hand) then I can of course clean this up. For what concerns the readability of the code in C++11, one thing which could help a little bit and might be feasible is if ```std::apply``` were added to the STL backports. Another concern I had is that this implementation might be a bit slower than the previous individual cases if compiled without optimization (e.g. when jitted).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7499#issuecomment-805893760:767,optimiz,optimization,767,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7499#issuecomment-805893760,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Bad interface, but it is what it is, and breaking the interface contract is out of question.; - Memory allocated by `MachineFunctionPass` is likely the object code output of the JIT.

This happens because the library depends on other libraries (`libXrdCrypto`, `libXrdUtils`) and cannot find them since the `@rpath` palceholder is not substituted with the correct path to the libraries directory at runtime.; While this is true for the xrootd libraries in `build/lib`, it's not for the ones in `build/XROOTD-prefix/../src` which have the `LC_RPATH` variable set. The difference can be shown with `otool -l`; ```; $ otool -l build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so > libXrdSecpwd_buildlib.txt; $ otool -l build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src/libXrdSecpwd-4.so > libXrdSecpwd_xrootdprefixlib.txt; $ diff libXrdSecpwd_buildlib.txt libXrdSecpwd_xrootdprefixlib.txt; < build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so:; ---; > build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src/libXrdSecpwd-4.so:; 307a308,311; > cmd LC_RPATH; > cmdsize 80; > path /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src (offset 12); > Load command 14; 312c316; < Load command 14; ---; ```.

Performance,"The problem with trying one after the other is that the number of combinations quickly goes through the roof. Consider that a python-side proxy can be freely converted from/to `T*`, `T**`, `T[]`, `T&`, `T&&`, and their `std::shared_ptr<>` and `std::unique_ptr<>` equivalents. So, that may mean 15 tries.

Performance,"There are a number of trivial operations that users often want to perform on dataframes that are surprisingly hard to get right, for example adding several `Define`s in a loop or conditionally adding a `Filter` depending on a runtime boolean (both use-cases are challenging in C++, trivial in python). The way I see it, difficulties boil down to the fact that different dataframe nodes have different types (because their types incorporate e.g. the type of the callable passed to a `Filter` and the type of their parent node in the computation graph). In this PR I propose to add a common base class `ROOT::RDF::RNode` to all nodes of the graph (except leaves a.k.a results, which have a completely different interface),; so that users can, for example:; * take any dataframe node by reference in non-template functions as `RNode&`; * `emplace_back` dataframe nodes in ~`std::vector<RNode>`~ `vector<RInterface<RNode>>`; * have non-const pointers to dataframe nodes. and so on. For example, conditionally adding a `Range` do a dataframe now looks like this:. ```c++; auto maybe_ranged = [&df, mustAddRange] { ; return mustAddRange ? ROOT::RDF::RNode(d.Range(1)); : ROOT::RDF::RNode(d); ; }(); ; ```. while before this PR one would have to add fake `Filter(""true"")` filters to normalize the return type of the lambda, involving the interpreter for no reason. Internal `RDataFrame` code is also simplified by the introduction of this common base class.; The only downside I can think of is that if this mechanism is abused users might end up with extra, unnecessary virtual calls in their event loop -- on the other hand, this mechanism should only be used in situations that required either complex template magic or dirty and slow tricks before.

The difference was that the ND path allocated the; `Double_v`s on the heap in a STD vector, and the 1D path used just an; single `Double_v` on the stack, probably for performance reasons. This commit suggests to use the stack also for the ND code path using; stack arrays, so the 1D path would not be a special case anymore. Also, the `<Math/Util.h>` header can not be compiled with CUDA if `vc` is enabled, so there is a second commit in this PR to avoid that.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13772:294,load,load,294,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13772,4,"['Load', 'load', 'perform']","['Load', 'load', 'performance']"
Performance,"There was an evil hack in `RooAbsOptTestStatistic`:. ```c++; _dataClone->cacheArgs(this,_cachedNodes,_normSet,!_funcClone->getAttribute(""BinnedLikelihood"")) ;; ```. The final parameter determins if zero weights should be skipped when recalculating the caches. Indeed, for the NLL case, this corresponds to the BinnedLikelihood attrribute being present or not, but it broke the other test statistics for which zero weights should not be skipped at all. This commit suggests a safer way to manage this with a new `RooAbOptTestStatistic::_skipZeroWeights` flag.

Performance,"This PR adds `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, an alternative to `RooMinimizerFcn` that calculates gradient itself outside of Minuit during minimization. To be able to use `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, `RooMinimizer` had to be refactored to be able to use `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` instead of the concrete RooMinimizerFcn class. To accomodate this change, several other changes had to be made:; - `_optConst` and `_func` members were removed, since these are now managed by the `*MinimizerFcn`.; - This means also things like function name and title, but also optimization switches, were moved to `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` as well.; - Functions `getMultiGenFcn`, `fitterFcn` and `fitFcn` were added which are used in several places as convenience functions to access the concrete `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` object with its proper type. The concrete type matters, for instance, when passing the class to the derivator, because a gradient enabled `*MinimizerFcn` needs to take different overloads than the classic function-value-only `RooMinimizerFcn`. A `FcnMode` enum class was added for this disambiguation as well.; - Construction of a `RooMinimizer` can be done the same as always when using a classic `RooMinimizerFcn`. However, to activate `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, a new create function can be used with the proper type as template parameter. In a later PR, this pattern will be extended with another gradient-enabled `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` instantiation that will also include multi-processing implementations. Since we had to refactor construction, we took the opportunity to also put default parameters in the header declaration, instead of in the constructor initializer lists. Finally, this PR changes the default minimizer from Minuit to Minuit2. **Note that this may require some discussion.** We already briefly touched upon this in a Zoom meeting, but haven't thoroughly mapped out consequences yet.

In jsroot itself there were many other changes to the code to adapt to the changed API when the d3.js file was updated to v4 as seen in the commit:. https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/commit/c156b8956f77d1aef4b70cd8609c4b1f2036f94f#diff-26681b69718507c05077030d69e5ba58. One more comment: In addition to the change that changes the name of the d3.js file, this PR also proposes changes to some error messages in jsroot.

Performance,"This PR modifies the TBufferMerger callback (that CMS requested) so that it wraps the merge operation--the callback is passed the function to perform the merge and is responsible for calling it. The motivation for this change is that the merge operation is taking enough CPU time that we need it to be executed in the CMSSW framework's TBB task arena so that we don't overrun our CPU commitment. With this change, we can use a callback like. ```; mergeExec_ = [this](const std::function<void()> &f){; std::promise<void> barrier;; auto fwrap = [&]() { ; auto set_value = [](decltype(barrier)* b) { b->set_value(); };; std::unique_ptr<decltype(barrier), decltype(set_value)> release(&barrier, set_value);; f();; };; taskArena_->enqueue(fwrap);; barrier.get_future().wait();; };; ```. to queue the merge operation to our task arena and wait for it to complete.

Performance,"This PR propagates the disconnect action from TFileCacheRead to TFilePrefetch. This is needed to restore TFilePrefetch compatibility with the CMS use of kDoNotDisconnect to swap TTreeCaches. CMS frequently swaps TTree caches with code like. filePtr_->SetCacheRead(cache, nullptr , TFile::kDoNotDisconnect);; branch->GetEntry(entryNumber);; filePtr_->SetCacheRead(nullptr, nullptr , TFile::kDoNotDisconnect);. This is done partially for ownership reasons and partially because CMS uses multiple TTreeCaches for different use cases (one cache for frequently read branches, a second for less frequently accessed branches, and potentially one or two more specialized use cases). kDoNotDisconnect tells the TFile that this cache may later be reconnected to the TFile, so it should not disconnect the cache from the file. TFile propagates the flag to TFileCacheRead, but TFileCacheRead does not propagate it to TFilePrefetch. If pre-fetching is enabled, TFilePrefetch clears its cached blocks due to this commit:. https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/4290bf4942285b754b2edb7bffd122bcf36c979d. which added clearing of the read and pending prefetch lists when SetFile() is called. This violates the assumptions made by TTreeCache in the kDoNotDisconnect case, leading to a deadlock where `TTreeCache::ReadBufferPrefetch` waits forever on a buffer that has been cleared from the prefetched and pending lists. This patch propagates the kDisconnect/kDoNotDisconnect action flag to `TFilePrefetch::SetFile`, only clearing the fetched and pending lists in the kDisconnect case. (The same end could be accomplished more simply by just not calling TFilePrefetch::SetFile() for the kDoNotDisconnect case; propagating the action seems more correct to me, but it is a matter of taste.)",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1769:218,cache,caches,218,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1769,6,['cache'],"['cache', 'cached', 'caches']"

Performance,"This commit enables serialization of the Python proxy defined within cppyy to the C++ std::runtime_error class.

Performance,"This commit provides a rewrite of key functions of TGeoParallelWorld, achieving: . (a) faster initialization; (b) faster execution of the Safety function (from ~O(N) to ~O(1)) ; (c) faster or equal execution of FindNode/FindBoundary functions (~log(N)) ; (d) less memory consumption (better memory scalability). The development for this commit was motivated from a use case in ALICE, in which the parallel world ""scene"" can be very large (~100K volumes). In this case, TGeoVoxelFinder takes very long; to construct and consumes a very large amount of memory (GBs). In addition, the evaluation of the Safety function dominates the Geant simulation time. The improvements in this commit are mainly achieved through:. * The use of a boundary volume hierarchy (BVH) as the base acceleration entity, replacing TGeoVoxelFinder.; BVH are the standard in industry/computer-graphics, for what concerns ray-object intersection tasks. The BVH is constructed from axis-aligned bounding boxes and employed in the FindBoundary/FindNode implementations. * The use of a 3D voxel grid (TGeoVoxelGrid) structure, able to store properties ""local"" or in the vicinity of a cartesian coordinate P. This structure allows to reduce the (typical) algorithmic complexity for ""Safety"" queries to ~O(1) (with a constant factor determined by the voxel size). Filling of the 3D voxel grid cache for Safety is done on-the-fly (using the BVH once). * (Optional) Additional caching of ""last-call"" safety values for really quick return when the value is still valid at the next call. Ideas for these improvements come from prior work in related libraries such as VecGeom. -----. Implementation details:. * The implementation is, for now (until fully tested), provided in a backward compatible manner:. - By default, nothing changes; - Users have to activate the BVH mode by setting an environment variable TGEO_PW_USEBVH; - Users may hence compare the 2 modes. * Functions for Safety, FindNode, FindBoundary dispatch to some internal i",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16442:298,scalab,scalability,298,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16442,1,['scalab'],['scalability']
Performance,"This commit provides an (optional) optimization to reduce the cost of safety evaluations associated with TGeoParallelWorld. The approach consists in the introduction of additional cache-state in TGeoNavigator. This state remembers the last location for which TGeoParallelWorld::Safety was evaluated, together with the corresponding value returned. Since TGeoNavigator follows the evolution of tracks step-by-step, we have some sort of history-locality. This means that the cache-state has a high-probability of being relevant for multiple track locations in a row. The optimization proposed here is orthogonal to other improvements. It adds on top of algorithmic improvements within TGeoParallelWorld (bounding volume hierarchies, see separate PR), gaining a few extra percent in speed. By default, the new feature is not enabled by default for backward compatibility. Once fully verified, we can make it the default mode. That said, in ALICE simulations, the caching did not modify stepping behaviour and yielded identical results compared to not doing the caching. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16470:35,optimiz,optimization,35,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16470,4,"['cache', 'optimiz']","['cache-state', 'optimization']"
Performance,"This commit provides the possibility to pass system library search paths as well as some compiler include paths to ROOT as environment variables.; This has the advantage that ROOT will spawn less sub-processes and we can do the setup only once, instead of doing it for every single executable that is linked to ROOT. The commit does not change any default behaviour! Rather, expert-users may use the new feature by moving the initialization of the search paths to say software environment loading. In ALICE, we do something like. ```; export ROOT_LDSYSPATH=$(LD_DEBUG=libs LD_PRELOAD=DOESNOTEXIST ls /tmp/DOESNOTEXIST 2>&1 | grep -m 1 ""system search path"" | sed 's/.*=//g' | awk '//{print $1}'). export ROOT_CPPSYSINCL=$(LC_ALL=C c++ -xc++ -E -v /dev/null 2>&1 | sed -n '/^.include/,${/^ \/.*++/{p}}' | tr '\n' ':' | tr ' ' ':'); ```. speeding up the initialization of our executables at runtime and doing less syscalls that create short-lived processes, for instance calling the compiler. The effect from this operation can be seen by counting the `execve` syscalls in a small example:. ```; strace -e execve -f root.exe -q -e ""double x=1;"" # ---> 14 calls. export ROOT_LDSYSPATH=...; export ROOT_CPPSYSINCL=...; strace -e execve -f root.exe -q -e ""double x=1;"" # ---> 6 calls; ```.

Performance,"This commit removes some functions from the RooFit data classes:. * `RooAbsData::valid()` (virtual method that was overridden in; RooDataHist but not RooDataSet). * `RooDataHist::valid(std::size_t i)` and `RooDataHist::valid()`. * `RooDataHist::cacheValidEntries()`. The `cacheValidEntries` method was originally intended to be used in; `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` to mask histogram entries out of the variable; range in case of a subrange fit. The reasons why `cacheValidEntries` and; the related `valid()` methods should be removed are:. 1. It is redundant. In a subrange fit, the `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` is; creating a clone of the dataset with the subrange only using; `RooAbsData::reduce()`. So all entries are valid by definition. 2. RooDataHist and RooDataSet have inconistent implementations. For; the RooDataHist, `valid()` tells you ""if bin `i` is considered; valid within the current range definitions of all observables""; (according to the documentation). For the RooDataSet, it always; returns `true`. This inconsistency leaves plenty of room for error. 3. The masking of out-of-range entries unnessecarily increases the; `mutable` state of the RooDataHist, which can cause trouble if one; updates the observable range but then forgets to call; `cacheValidEntries()`. 4.

The new algorithm to figure out the servers of a RooRealIntegral could get very expensive for large computation graphs, as seen with the ATLAS Higgs combinaiton. The problem was that there was a loop over an arguments clients for each argument in the computation graph. In this commit, loop is replaced by another loop over the computation graph in which one iterates only over the servers of the arguments that depend on the integration variables. I think this logic is even more intuitive to understand as well. I learned also that iterating over clients is never a good idea, because while the number of servers is well defined, there can be arbitrary many clients, making the performance very unpredictable.

Performance,"This issue is very case-dependent.; When trying to calculate memory usage, normally the actual free memory on the system is `free + buffer + cached `. If shared memory usage is high (e.g mmaping a big cache) the calculation is slightly different:; `(free + buffer/cache) - shared`. The author of **htop** mentions on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55090900/how-can-i-calculate-memory-utilisation-of-a-linux-server-using-sar-report) question that htop uses this convention(in 2016):. - Total used memory = MemTotal - MemFree; - Non cache/buffer memory = Total used memory - (Buffers + Cached memory). Now htop (managed by htop-dev) uses this (on https://github.com/htop-dev/htop/blob/main/linux/LinuxMachine.c#L210):. ```; const memory_t usedDiff = freeMem + cachedMem + sreclaimableMem + buffersMem;; host->usedMem = (totalMem >= usedDiff) ? totalMem - usedDiff : totalMem - freeMem;; ```. This issue intends to merge the total used memory to include cached instead of just free which isn't strictly a correct solution.

Performance,"This patch consolidates the symbol resolution facilities throughout TCling into; a new singleton class Dyld part of the cling's DynamicLibraryManager. The new dyld is responsible for:; * Symlink resolution -- it implements a memory efficient representation of; the full path to shared objects allowing search at constant time O(1). This; also fixes issues when resolving symbols from OSX where the system libraries; contain multiple levels of symlinks.; * Bloom filter optimization -- it uses a stohastic data structure which gives; a definitive answer if a symbol is not in the set. The implementation checks; the .gnu.hash section in ELF which is the GNU implementation of a bloom; filter and uses it. If the symbol is not in the bloom filter, the; implementation builds its own and uses it. The measured performance of the; bloom filter is 30% speed up for 2mb more memory. The custom bloom filter on; top of the .gnu.hash filter gives 1-2% better performance.; The advantage for the custom bloom filter is that it works on all; implementations which do not support .gnu.hash (windows and osx). It is also; customizable if we want to further reduce the false positive rates; (currently at p=2%).; * Hash table optimization -- we build a hash table which contains all symbols; for a given library. This allows us to avoid the fallback symbol iteration; if multiple symbols from the same library are requested. The hash table; optimization targets to optimize the case where the bloom filter tells us; the symbol is *maybe* in the library. Patch by Alexander Penev (@alexander-penev) and me!.

Performance,"This problem appears ""only"" in newer OS/compiler (as seen in the original reports leading to #12715) the dependent library are now dlclose'd when the 'main' library is dlclose'd. In the example a cmake generated library is linked against `libHist` and `libHist` is then loaded and unloaded when the example's library is (intentionally) loaded and unloaded. `libHist` happens to share a STL collection's dictionary (`std::vector<TString>`) with `libCore` (and this collection is used for the reading of rootpcm files and thus during the loading of the example's library). . Details:. Unload only the TClass actually generated by the unloaded library. The TGenericClassInfo's destructor now passes the TClass that they actually generated in; addition to the name so that only that TClass is destroyed. This avoid the problem (seen in #12715) where 2 librares (`A` and `B`) have a dictionary for the same; STL collection (this is supported) and we have the following sequence of operation:. 1. load library A; 2. load library B (dictionary registration is ignored as intended); 3. request TClass for STL collection.; 4. unload (dclose) library B; 5. use TClass for STL collection. With the previous code, step 4. would lead to the TClass for STL; collection to be marked as ""unloaded"" even though it library (A); was still actually loaded. Fix reloading of library with a module. Prior to this fix, the in-memory rootpcm loaded as part of the module was removed; from memory on first use and thus if the library was closed and re-opened/loaded; we no longer had the information needed to restore the TClass object corresponding; to that library.

Performance,"This pull request adds support for the concatenation of RNTuple pages into 'cages' that are then written to, and read from, DAOS containers as a single value of the key-value object store under the same attribute key, thus the smallest addressable unit. Pages from the same page-group are concatenated in the order they are handled on the DAOS side through vector I/O from the sealed pages' buffers. The name 'cage' is a portmanteau of ""concatenated pages"" and suggests the fact that pages caged together must be read together in DAOS. This change emancipates the DAOS backend from the original, on-disk ntuple page size. The option to concatenate sealed and buffered pages avoids unnecessary throughput constraints caused by the original page size (e.g., the on-disk default, 64KiB, generally leads to lower performance than pages an order of magnitude larger, e.g. 1MiB), particularly if the pattern of data analysis is based on reading back entire page-group ranges at once. On the other hand, this change ties the reader to the new, concatenated sizes; in DAOS key-value stores, it is impossible to read only a part of the value. It is important that the cage size limit be set adequately for the use-case during writing to DAOS. ## Changes or fixes:. - `RNTupleWriteOptions` provides a way to `SetMaxCageSize()` (default: caging enabled with 1 MiB cages), the maximum size a concatenation of pages from the same page-group can achieve.; - `RPageSinkDaos::CommitSealedPageVImpl()` maps pages from the same page-group to the same attribute key, thus concatenating them on the DAOS-side (i.e. relies on scatter-gathered I/O) until the cage limit is reached. The cage sizes can vary due to page compression and the length of page-groups, thus it is calculated and stored to be referenced when reading back.; - `RWOperation` is generalized to allow many IOVs associated with one attribute key in a request, enabling the non-contiguous buffers of sealed pages to be aggregated into a cage under the sam",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11466:693,throughput,throughput,693,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11466,2,"['perform', 'throughput']","['performance', 'throughput']"
Performance,"This pull request extends `RPageSink` to allow for vector commit of sealed pages.

These changes enable (parallel) vector writes in concrete backends, e.g. in DAOS. Derived classes that do not override the base implementation will see a sequence of calls to `CommitSealedPage()`. The first measurements of vector writes on DAOS based on this PR, indicate an improvement of _an order of magnitude_ in the write throughput. The refactor in this PR passes all the RPageSinkBuf tests. ## Changes or fixes:; - Add `CommitSealedPageV()` to the public interface of `RPageSink`. This function carries out a vector write of a number of sealed page ranges. Each range applies to a given columnId.; The default implementation of `CommitSealedPageVImpl()` sequentially calls `CommitSealedPageImpl()` for each page on each range, but derived classes can override it to provide an optimized implementation.; - Use `CommitSealedPageV()` in RPageSinkBuf.

Performance,"This pull request is the result of work done by David Clark as a summer intern at Argonne:; To prepare for multi-threaded workflows, a preloading and retaining clusters feature is introduced. This change will prevent additional reads from occurring when reading events out of sequence.; ; By setting the `MaxVirtualSize` of the tree to a negative value, entire clusters will be loaded into memory and previous clusters will be retained - the absolute value of `MaxVirtualSize` indicates how many additional clusters will be kept in memory.; ; If `TTree MaxVirtualSize` is set to a negative value, `GetEntry()` will load the entire cluster into memory, not just the first basket. `GetBasket()` is modified to call a new function `GetFreshCluster()` if `MaxVirtualSize` is negative. This function is responsible for returning a new basket and clearing out clusters from memory. Because clusters can have varying numbers of baskets, `GetFreshCluster()` reuses the first basket and clear the rest of the baskets. Reusing all baskets may be more efficient, but adds significant complexity and would not affect the typical case where each cluster only contains a single basket (all the baskets will be reused here).; ; To test the performance of the change, I read 1000 entries (about 1 GB) from a tree of randomly generated data consisting of 2000 branches. Every read had a 2.5% chance of reading 10 entries back or a 2.5% chance of reading 10 entries forward from the current entry. - Without the change enables there were 1.5 GB read in 31102 read calls. ; - With MaxVirtualSize set to -1, there were 1.1 GB read in 90 read calls.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/796:107,multi-thread,multi-threaded,107,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/796,4,"['load', 'multi-thread', 'perform']","['load', 'loaded', 'multi-threaded', 'performance']"

Performance,"This pull request provides a page allocator that caches previous allocations up to a certain limit. The cache is thread-local and defaults to 16 pages per thread (~1MiB per thread for default-sized pages). This PR is largely based on the concepts in #8634. Reuse of memory allocations in `RPageAllocatorCache` not only reduces calls to the global allocator but also heap fragmentation. The global allocator is thread-safe albeit locked; thus, to also reduce contention, the cache in `RPageAllocatorCache` is thread-local.; Given the small size of the (per-thread) cache, the internal structure is a simple `std::deque`. Anything more complex is not justified at the moment of this writing. . **NOTE:** Performance evaluation (specially for the multi-threaded case) should be inserted here tomorrow. ## Changes or fixes:; - Add `RPageAllocatorCache`: this templated allocator returns pages that have at least the required capacity. `DeletePage()` does not immediately deallocate memory; instead, pages are returned to a thread-local cache, dropping the smallest allocated buffer if the cache is full. If a previous page cannot be recycled, the underlying allocator `AllocT` (`RPageAllocatorHeap` by default) is used to allocate memory.; - Change the signature of `RPageSource::UnsealPage()`: `SealPage()`, the counterpart of `UnsealPage()` takes an RPage and returns an RSealedPage. Make the interface of `UnsealPage()` symmetric and return an RPage.; - Make `UnsealPage()` use `RPageAllocatorCache` by default.; - Remove stray `RPageAllocator{File,Daos}` classes. ## Checklist:; - [X] tested changes locally; - [X] updated the docs (if necessary).

Performance,This was reported at https://github.com/art-framework-suite/art/issues/142 and is due to the combination of; (a) We do not generate dictionary for std::tuple instances (b) When TClass::GetClass is called it tries to load the dictonary until there is a full TClass object is in memory (c) The emulated std::tuple TClass are marked as 'not loaded' (d) Searching for the TClass for a templated class will cost memory (during the lookup of the instantiation). (e) TPluginManager::ExecPluginImpl was looking up the TClass for the typle `std::type< list of arguments>`. The lookup induced in (e) in the user's case (root built with runtime cxx module on) lead to some memory allocation in Clang while trying to find out if there was now a library or dictionary to load.

Right now, `ESysConstants::kItimerResolution` is not assignable at runtime, and `TThreadTimer` timeout is not configurable by the user, thus the only solution is a fork and recompile. ### To Reproduce. 1. cd /opt/ && git clone https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11; 2.

Performance,"Up to now all ES6 modules were loaded with relative path like `./jsrootsys/modules/core.mjs`. ; This works nice when all used code is located in one sub-directory `./jsrootsys/` which is alias for `$ROOTSYS/js`.; But this does not work when other location has to be used and modules have to reference jsroot code. Solution provided by modern browsers is `importmap` which can look like:; ```; <script type=""importmap"">; {; ""imports"": {; ""jsroot"": ""./jsrootsys/modules/main.mjs"",; ""jsroot/draw"": ""./jsrootsys/modules/draw.mjs"",; ""jsroot/io"": ""./jsrootsys/modules/io.mjs"",; ""jsrootsys/"" :: ""./jsrootsys/""; }; }; ```.

Therefore add support of ""importmap"" in `THttpServer` which automatically insert appropriate map if `<!--jsroot_importmap-->` comment appears in HTML file. .

Performance,"Updates of the day:. ### 1; @Axel-Naumann suggested creating targets for the builtin_xrootd libraries . This should in theory give us the possibility of changing target properties through something like; `set(TARGET libXrdSecpwd-4 PROPERTY INSTALL_RPATH ${CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_LIBDIR})`. We still want to keep all the building process in the `ExternalProject_Add` step, thus these new targets would be created as IMPORTED libraries. But unfortunately, CMake doesn't allow to install IMPORTED libraries as TARGETS ([SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41179630), [CMake developer citation](https://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=14311) ). ### 2; I tried to create a post install script that manually invokes `install_name_tool` to change the rpath from the build directory to the install directory. This would be called in `SearchInstalledSoftware.cmake` through something like; `install(SCRIPT ""${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/modules/XROOTDPostInstall.cmake"")`; and the script itself would work along these lines; ```; file(GLOB XROOTD_ALL_LIBRARIES; ""${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/libXrd*""; ); find_program(INSTALL_NAME_TOOL install_name_tool). if(INSTALL_NAME_TOOL); foreach(XRD_LIB_PATH ${XROOTD_ALL_LIBRARIES}); set(OLD_RPATH ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/lib); set(NEW_RPATH ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib); execute_process(COMMAND ${INSTALL_NAME_TOOL} -rpath ${OLD_RPATH} ${NEW_RPATH} $$; endforeach(); endif(); ```; The problem with this idea, if not for its ad-hoc nature, is that `install_name_tool` would actually be called each time `cmake --install` is called causing errors from the second time since ${OLD_RPATH} is not set to the `build` folder anymore:; ```; error: install_name_tool: no LC_RPATH load command with path: /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/lib found in: /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/install/lib/libXrdClient.dylib (for architecture x86_64), required for specified option ""-rpath /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/lib /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/install/lib""; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6128#issuecomment-672083860:1704,load,load,1704,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6128#issuecomment-672083860,1,['load'],['load']
Performance,"Updates on the failing tests:; * Centos8/multicore: Failure because the same wrong mechanism of changing files happens in `FinalizeSlot` instead of `Finalize` in `SnapshotHelperMT`. Weirdly this didn't happen on my machine with 8 threads but it does on this node with 16 threads, still not sure what's the real difference there.; * MacOS: Both failures happen in the dataframe test, but in the **single threaded** Snapshot, that is in the `Finalize` method of the `SnapshotHelper` class. At first this PR wasn't even considering the single threaded case, that's also why `SnapshotHelper` wasn't modified. So there was this difference between the single threaded Snapshot that still used the weird ChangeFile behaviour (although it shouldn't have triggered a segfault anyway since it's using a plain TFile), and the multithreaded Snapshot that got its behaviour changed to avoid the issue. Considering both types of failures, and the fact that a coherent behaviour across the two Snapshot modes is desirable, I would refactor the usage of `TTree::SetMaxTreeSize` inside of RDF Snapshot in a single common point that both single-thread and multi-thread operations have to go through, if that exists.

Performance,"Vassil,. > We cannot control what's in the static init of user libraries. They can; use interpreter services. This approach used to work, why locking is; necessary? Aren't we 'just' reading?. Other threads could be trying to write the symbol tables at the same time,; so we still need to lock them for reading. In your case your lookup enters a generator (HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator),; so it will end up writing as well as reading. :). The right thing to do here is to refactor HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator; to do its work in two steps:; Step 1: Identify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested; symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you; should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ (; ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each; library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using; JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll; walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should; prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in; precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider; a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor; that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a; circular reference). I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock; (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like; this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so""; provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and; resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""...; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers a lookup in; the JIT for ""f"".; 2.2.1.

Performance,"What can be done here is rather simple. The bottleneck last time I checked is rootcling (dictionary generation). There are two reasons:; * cmake -- dictionary generation depends on LinkDef and header files and both artifacts are available from the beginning. However, the cmake build system does not have separate targets for dictionary generation and library generation. That leads to forcing rootcling to wait for the expensive linking step of each library. For example, instead of building `Y.pcm` once we are done with building `X.pcm` we wait for the linker to link `X.so`.; * rootcling is unnecessary slow -- the tool has grown organically and in many cases we make many iterations over the AST where we don't need them. Some of the larger scale ideas have been outlined here since years: https://github.com/root-project/root-evolution/pull/5 In fact, we don't need to get so much into the refactoring rootcling, attaching a profiler and seeing the bottlenecks should be easy.

Performance,"When performing multi-thread reads of ROOT files, we need to pick the number; of TBB tasks among which we will divide the dataset. Our heuristic is ""try to produce around `T = N/ntrees` tasks per tree per; worker thread"": we don't know the number of clusters in each tree before; we open the files, so we don't know the total number of clusters upfront.; Instead we set a ""desired value"" of T tasks per tree and per thread, and; then when each thread opens a file it tries to make T tasks out of it (if; the file turns out to be too small, it might end up producing _less_ tasks than; desired. If we are processing `M > N` small files, we might end up producing; _more_ tasks per worker than N). N is a free parameter, and it represents the desired total number of; tasks per worker. If N is too low, parallelism will be too coarse-grained; and we might get imbalance/tails with bad parallelization.; The higher N is, the more CPU time we spend in task setup/teardown. Empirically, I believe we have set N too high (before this patch we set; it to 24).

As concrete example, if one needed to implement a PDF such as `f(x) = a/x + b*x + c`, it feels like we should be able to do; ```c; // Define custom pdf; RooGenericPdf my_pdf(""my_pdf"", ""x[1]/x[0] + x[2]*x[0] + x[3]"", RooArgList(x, a, b, c));; // Set formula for analytical integral; my_pdf.SetAnalyticalIntegralFormula(""x[1]*TMath::Log(x[0]) + x[2]*x[0]*x[0]/2 + x[0]*x[3]"");; ```.

Performance,"With master (commit 7f3f3428e4d20) (but has been present for a long time), PyROOT overload resolution of function that takes an enum class is unstable (it appears to depend on the value rather than the type).

ROOT.gSystem.Load(""enums_cxx""). h = ROOT.Holder(); for i in range(10, 0, -1):; h.SetTwo(i); ROOT.to_string(h.two); ```; gives; ```txt; Calling to_string for enum EOne with 0; Calling to_string for enum EOne with 1; ...; ```.

Performance,"With multiple concurrent `RNTupleFillContext`s, the order of clusters is generally indeterminate and entries are only partially ordered. With staged cluster committing, this restriction can be partially lifted by splitting a cluster commit into two phases:; 1. Once full, or when manually triggered, all fields are committed which triggers flushing of all columns. All pages are compressed and staged via the page sink. The result is a `RStagedCluster` that records all information for the second phase. This step can be repeated multiple times as entries are filled into the context.; 2. When appropriate for the application, all staged clusters can be committed, which logically appends them to the RNTuple. This is implemented in a single critical section, which guarantees that the clusters and their entries are consecutive. Moreover, by synchronizing the second phase between multiple contexts, the application can enforce a total ordering of all contained entries at reasonable resource consumption: During the first phase, all write buffers are flushed and will be reused for the following cluster. The metadata stored in `RStagedCluster` should require only minimal memory, which will accumulate while staging more clusters. Staged cluster committing is expected to be slightly slower than the default mode, but should still scale well as the second phase only updates the metadata which is a lightweight operation compared to preparing and filling entries, compressing pages, and writing them to disk. A noteworthy disadvantage is that staged cluster committing will lead to non-linear files, where sequentially iterating over clusters may require seeking to distant file offsets. The impact resulting from this will depend on the storage technology and the read pattern.

Since the old interpolation; implementation `RooDataHist::interpolateDim()` only supported up to second; order interpolation, it has been completely replaced by; `RooDataHist::interpolateLinear()` and `RooDataHist::interpolateQuadratic()`; in these `computeBatch()` functions in the case of one dimensional histograms. # This Pull request:. ## Changes or fixes:. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally; - [x] updated the docs (if necessary)",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11224:1063,perform,performed,1063,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11224,1,['perform'],['performed']

Performance,"With this change, fields are only added to the `REntry` and read when they are referenced in the processor loop. This prevents unecessary reads of unused fields. It also makes the REntry completely transparent from an interface perspective. Pointers to values can be obtained through the processor interface itself *before* the iteration starts, or alternatively via the iterator returned by the processor. Important to note that during iteration, the pointer returned by `RNTupleProcessor::GetPtr` will **not** contain the value for the current entry. The reason for this is that from the `RNTupleProcessor` interface there is (with the current implementation) no way to know what the current entry index is. For now, `RNTupleProcessor::GetPtr` contains a warning and a recommendation to get the pointer through the iterator instead. Alternative solutions could be:; 1. Remove `RNTupleProcessor::GetPtr` altogether and only allow access to the field value pointers through the iterator.; 2.

Performance,"You're right! I misunderstood, I thought `std::rotate` rotated the whole iterable (e.g. like https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.roll.html), but I see now it only puts the selected part in front and shoves the rest aside to make room. But then apparently there are still situations that we are not catching. I think probably sometimes there will be yet another task executed before all tasks are in the queue. This is of course always possible, because the OS can delay processes and IPC in any way it sees fit. I can up the sleep time to compensate for this so it happens less often, but it is by the nature of the algorithm unavoidable that some statistical failures will still happen (given slow enough OS'es). What we can do to make sure that the test never fails is to iteratively go through all received tasks and modify the expected order until it matches, but of course in the extreme case that every step is reordered this would then defeat the purpose of the test. A more robust approach would be to wait with taking work off the queue until all tasks have been submitted, but this is not actually desirable functionality, because that would mean workers would be doing nothing when they could already be working. Introducing such functionality just for testing purposes seems silly. So not sure how to ""fix"" this. I will at least put `std::rotate` back in.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11627#issuecomment-1330419059:422,queue,queue,422,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11627#issuecomment-1330419059,2,['queue'],['queue']
Performance,"Your understanding is correct, you can go ahead with v6.24/00. For the compile time pinning, from the discussion we had yesterday, we can have architecture specific builds, so that, for example, `x86_64-centos7-gcc9-opt` will stick to the basic `x86-64` instructions, while `haswell-centos7-gcc9-opt` will do its best using AVX2 and all other goodies you get on that platform (we can also use the microarchitecture levels like `x86-64-v2` which will be available as of GCC 11 and Clang 12). For the RooFit specific case, our analysis does not use the builds from SFT and we do not use RooFit in trigger and reconstruction (which are the cases that I'm most worried about). Let's see from somebody in ATLAS what they think. I anyway (as a matter of principle) would prefer if you can have dynamic architecture dispatching that I can turn off in specific builds. @oshadura also mention possible optimizations in compression algorithms, but, again, that's a case that does not worry me, as they only deal with integers, so you do not get incompatible/incorrect results by changing the order of operations (unless there's a bug). The bottom line is that I'm worried about numerical instabilities due to the change of order of floating point operations in trigger and reconstruction code. It doesn't matter if scalar or avx2 versions produce slightly different results, as long as I know that running the scalar version of the application will always give me the same result.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7361#issuecomment-793617647:893,optimiz,optimizations,893,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7361#issuecomment-793617647,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']
Performance,"[ (; ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each; library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using; JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll; walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should; prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in; precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider; a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor; that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a; circular reference). I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock; (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like; this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so""; provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and; resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""...; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers a lookup in; the JIT for ""f"".; 2.2.1.

There is no work to trigger (we started materializing it; already in (2.1)), so the link is suspended pending resolution of ""x"".; Critically, the dlopen cannot complete until the link completes.; 2.2. MU *would* dlsym ""x"", but it's blocked waiting on the dlopen to finish. And we're deadlocked again. The root cause of the problem is that ld.so and the JIT don't communicate; immediately about symbol resolutions. What we really wanted was for the; dlopen to register the library symbols with the JIT before it ran the; initializers, but that's just not the way dlopen works today.

Performance,"[skip-ci]. # This Pull request:. Makes the CI load OpenStack object-store credentials from files on runners instead of using GitHub secrets. When `pull_request` is a workflow trigger, the job can't access secrets, which means that the S3 secret token is unavailable. Adding S3 credentials to the runners themselves solves this issue. The OpenStack credentials are defined [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/ai/it-puppet-hostgroup-lcgapp/-/blob/rootci_test/code/manifests/build/root.pp#L43) (using [teigi](https://configdocs.web.cern.ch/secrets/adding.html)). If a malicious actor makes a PR with a job to print the credentials, or to upload a malicious artifact, it would still have to be approved by a maintainer. A safer alternative is not allowing pull request jobs to upload artifacts at all but then we can't run tests in a separate job. It would also cause builds to take more time on average because the object storage will be less populated. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12201:46,load,load,46,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12201,1,['load'],['load']

It can now only read repository (when PR commenting is getting implemented it has to run in a separate workflow anyways); - Re-enables output buffering to improve performance, at the cost of stderr being redirected to stdout.

The total number of entries in the chain/tentrylist is larget than `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()`. With the first call to `GetEntryAndTree`, I give as input exactly the int limit, and the output is correct (index of the tree = 100, index of the entry in that tree = 47). With the next call, the input is the int limit + 1, from which one would expect the same tree and just one entry beyond the previous one, i.e. 48.

Performance,"`TCling.cxx`’s `RegisterCxxModules` loads explicitly several modules including `Core`, `Rint` and `RIO`. When executing rootcling (for example for G__Net.cxx) *before* `G__Rint.cxx` was created and thus before `lib/Rint.pcm` was properly created, a default `lib/Rint.pcm` is auto-generated and registered as one of the dependencies. Later the real `lib/Rint.pcm` is created is creation date is later than other `pcm` than depends-on/uses it’s creation time. For example:. ```; $ ls -lart lib/Net.pcm lib/MultiProc.pcm lib/Imt.pcm lib/MathCore.pcm lib/Rint.pcm; -rw-r--r-- 1 pcanal pcanal 1158548 Nov 10 20:26 lib/Net.pcm; -rw-r--r-- 1 pcanal pcanal 1278392 Nov 10 20:27 lib/MultiProc.pcm; -rw-r--r-- 1 pcanal pcanal 2032752 Nov 10 20:27 lib/Imt.pcm; -rw-r--r-- 1 pcanal pcanal 12911448 Nov 10 20:27 lib/MathCore.pcm; -rw-r--r-- 1 pcanal pcanal 444724 Nov 10 20:35 lib/Rint.pcm; ```. then later uses of those `pcm` leads to the (mis-worded) error message:. ```; <<< cling interactive line includer >>>: fatal error: module file '/home/neel/Desktop/Root/build/lib/Rint.pcm' is out of date and needs to be rebuilt: could not read module signature; <<< cling interactive line includer >>>: note: imported by module 'MathCore' in '/home/neel/Desktop/Root/build/lib/MathCore.pcm'; Error: Module 'MathCore.pcm' failed to load.; Error: Error loading the default rootcling header files.; make[2]: *** [math/mathmore/CMakeFiles/G__MathMore.dir/build.make:130: math/mathmore/G__MathMore.cxx] Error 1; ```.

Performance,"`gInterpreter::ProcessLine` has an important run-time cost.; Instead of calling it everytime the jitting of an action is required, we now store all the strings that are to jit in TLoopManager and do a single call to `gInterpreter::ProcessLine` before running the event-loop. A couple of life-time issues had to be resolved for this to work properly: in order to let result proxies and action helpers share ownership of the result object, I introduced (simple) manual lifetime management of a shared_ptr (weird, I know). In order to deal with deferred jitting of an action that hangs from a node whose `TInterface` has already been destroyed (can happen due to the deferral of jitting) all `BuildAndBook` functions have been made independent of `TInterface`. In the long term it might be possible to refactor the jitting mechanism so that the `TAction` (and the `TTreeReaderValue/Array`s that it contains) is jitted but the action helpers are not, lifting the requirement of manual lifetime management of a shared_ptr. Although this should be possible in principle, I currently don't see how we could integrate it with the existing logic, so I decided for this much less invasive solution. Before/after runtimes for two extreme scenarios:. `test_inference.cxx` (which performs a lot of jitting).; compile time: ~8s -> ~9s; run time: ~40s -> ~7s. 50 jitted Histo1D calls in a loop (thanks to Attila for the use-case):; run time: ~35s -> <2s.

I am not sure what you mean (i.e a straight replacement would not have 'large' performance improvement).

Simplest implementation is to have Cartesian coordinates as private attributes;. 2. The users find that they most often use radius and azimuth, hence decide to store spherical coordinates instead of (x,y,z);. 3. Actually, colliders use eta more often than theta, so that the internal state is now given by (r, phi, eta). * In parallel and independently, Hit also evolves:. a. Simplest implementation is to have only the energy as private member;. b. Because the number of requests for the transverse energy is very high, the users want to optimize the speed by keeping Et as private member;. c. Well, it happens that disk space is short and e() is rarely called, so that it makes sense to reduce the size of the Hit class by dropping the energy member and computing the energy just when calling the method e(). They also found that the detector parameters used to store data in version b are wrong, so that one needs to scale the energy by 1.3 only for version b (a and c are correct).

Performance,"aces, and I wanted to understand why this was leaking a lot of memory. This is in 6.22/08 but I think the problems persist in master. Thankfully the biggest leak is easy to fix and I'll make a PR for that soon (workspace not cleaning up all its RooLinkedLists). But the next biggest one has taken me a while to understand....; <br>Valgrind reported lots of leaking of RooObjCacheManager instances. I believe a way to evidence this is with a minimal reproducer (see above).; <br>If you track how many times a RooObjCacheManager is constructed with these lines, the first line constructs one of them (the `_normMgr` of the RooAbsPdf class). But when the file is read back in on the second line, I see two RooObjCacheManagers get constructed. The first one comes from the constructor of the RooAbsPdf (via the gaussian), but the second comes from streaming of the RooAbsArg base class which contains a `std::deque<RooAbsCache*> _cacheList`. ; <br>So what I'm seeing is that in the first line where the pdf is first created, the `_normMgr` (which is declared as `RooObjCacheManager _normMgr` in `RooAbsPdf`) is the same as the one in the `_cacheList`. But when you read back the pdf in the second line, the `_normMgr` no longer is the same as the one in the `_cacheList` -- both caches (the one in the `_cacheList` and the `_normMgr`) have the gaus as its owner, but they are distinct objects and when the gaus is deleted I assume the one in the `_cacheList` doesnt get destroyed, causing the leak. ; <br>If my diagnosis is correct, then I dunno what would be the correct way to fix this, the best way I can think of so far would be making `RooObjCacheManager` always be a pointer rather than an instance data member. Do others have thoughts?; <br>Worth acknowledging the problem probably isn't just a memory leak when we have an inconsistency between the list of caches in the `RooAbsArg` base class vs the actual caches the derived classes might be interacting with directly, but i havent studied that.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8764:3316,cache,caches,3316,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8764,3,['cache'],['caches']

Will error if any of the branches are not found.; --branches-regex bregex1 [bregex2 ...]; Reads any branches with a name matching the provided regex.

Will automatically cap to the number of available threads on the machine.; --tasks-per-worker ntasks; The number of tasks to generate for each worker thread when using multithreading. Description:. rootreadspeed is a tool used to help identify bottlenecks in ROOT analysis programs by providing an idea of what throughput you can expect when reading ROOT files in certain configurations. It does this by providing information about the number of bytes read from your files, how long this takes, and the different throughputs in MB/s, both in total and per thread. Compressed vs Uncompressed Throughput:. Throughput speeds are provided as compressed and uncompressed - ROOT files are usually saved in compressed format, so these will often differ. Compressed bytes is the total number of bytes read from TFiles during the readspeed test (possibly including meta-data). Uncompressed bytes is the number of bytes processed by reading the branch values in the TTree. Throughput is calculated as the total number of bytes over the total runtime (including decompression time) in the uncompressed and compressed cases. Interpreting results:. There are three possible scenarios when using rootreadspeed, namely:. 1. The 'Real Time' is significantly lower than your own analysis runtime.; This would imply your actual application code is dominating the runtime of your analysis, ie. your analysis logic or framework is taking up the time. The best way to decrease the runtime would be to optimize your code, attempt to parallelize it onto multiple threads if possible, or use a machine with ",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14039:2171,Throughput,Throughput,2171,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14039,1,['Throughput'],['Throughput']
Performance,"and caches the polynomial; coefficients. This has serveral disadvantages:. * High cost in memory (the big ATLAS models can have thousands of; `FlexibleInterpVars`. * It's inconsistent with the `PiecewiseInterpolation`, which should be; equivalent. * Most importantly, and this was the motivation for this PR now:; when we do the code generation for AD, we can't pre-compute cached; coefficients because it would bloat the generated code with constant; arrays. Computing on the fly is much more AD-friendly. Validation of the new `FlexibleInterpVar` values for `low=0.9` and; `high=1.2` that shows the interpolated values are agreeing to the 5e-4; level. This is completely accepatable for such an ad-hoc polynomial; motivation, where the shape is not given by any physical meaning anyway; but just by the continuity condition at the boundaries. And at the; boundaries (and `param=0`), the difference between both implementations; goes to zero. It was also checked that this change has no performance; effect on fitting the full ATLAS Higgs combination modes. ```txt; param ref new diff_abs diff_rel; 0 -1.00 0.9000000000 0.9000000000 0.0000000000 0.00E+00; 1 -0.95 0.9047424331 0.9047437816 0.0000013485 1.49E-06; 2 -0.85 0.9140836603 0.9141118876 0.0000282273 3.09E-05; 3 -0.75 0.9230659064 0.9231653329 0.0000994265 1.08E-04; 4 -0.65 0.9317147727 0.9319176341 0.0002028614 2.18E-04; 5 -0.55 0.9402402768 0.9405514067 0.0003111300 3.31E-04; 6 -0.45 0.9489635592 0.9493568763 0.0003933171 4.14E-04; 7 -0.35 0.9582539443 0.9586769214 0.0004229771 4.41E-04; 8 -0.25 0.9684763536 0.9688599643 0.0003836107 3.96E-04; 9 -0.15 0.9799490728 0.9802212720 0.0002721992 2.78E-04; 10 -0.05 0.9929118716 0.9930125518 0.0001006802 1.01E-04; 11 0.05 1.0075044778 1.0073993699 -0.0001051079 -1.04E-04; 12 0.15 1.0237554038 1.0234460012 -0.0003094025 -3.02E-04; 13 0.25 1.0415811263 1.0411077858 -0.0004733405 -4.54E-04; 14 0.35 1.0607956204 1.0602318105 -0.0005638099 -5.31E-04; 15 0.45 1.0811302458 1.0805675762 -0.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13067:1647,perform,performance,1647,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13067,1,['perform'],['performance']

Performance,"anslation/rotation is applied to a TGeoVolumeAssembly through the `MakePhysicalNode > Align` sequence, the BoundingBox of this TGeoVolumeAssembly may end up with 0 size (GetDX, GetDY and GetDZ returning 0).; This is not expected as it means there are other effects on the Volume aside from the translation/rotation, even when shifting something without leaving its parent volume. Something similar happens if a translation/rotation is applied to a Node which is part of a TGeoVolumeAssembly, but there it probably happens only if the changes leads to part of the assembly exceeding the original boundaries.; We (me and @fuhlig1) suspect that this may partially be recursive (affecting the parent of the aligned volume). This can be cured by forcing the recomputation of the BoundingBox of the affected Volume. ### Expected behavior; After alignment of the nodes, all volumes/nodes are offset/rotated with their other properties valid.; Or if not possible due to performance, a warning should be printout with hint of the proper way to restore/recompute these values. A temporary fix was introduced for now in FairRoot, which is to simply do the recompute for all TGeoVolumeAssembly in the geometry tree, which seems to be fast enough that we do not have to try to track affected Volumes to be more selective. ; This may however not be the case later when applied to complete geometries for experiments like CBM. ### To Reproduce; Steps to reproduce the behavior with the attached files (includes ""ROOT-only"" examples both for problem and for macro-level fix):; 1. Compile a copy of ROOT 6.22.08 (done with FairSoft apr21p2 and FairRoot v18.6.7, should work with any older versions of each and with recent versions of FairRoot, as well as with a standalone version of ROOT); 1.

Performance,"are currently only available when the compiler flag DEBUG is defined. In my experience, trouble with minimizing some function is common so it would be a great asset to enable more debug output at anytime by just increasing the print level without recompiling ROOT. The DEBUG messages are particularly problematic in the current system, because they use std::cout while MnPrint uses the compile-time configurable MNLOG (which defaults to std::cerr). ### Possible negative side-effects. #### Breaking changes?. This proposal does not change the output for print level 0, but there is a minor change for print level 1. It changes the output of scripts/software that uses print level 1, because previously level 1 meant ""print errors and info"" while in the new hierarchy it means ""print errors and warnings"". I think this is a minor effect, which has to be documented in the next changelog but it cannot cause backward incompatibilities or breakage. #### Reduced performance?. The impact on performance is expected to be negligible. I propose to place additional calls into the compiled code for everyone, but these calls are not executed unless the user picks a high print level. For a low print level, there is just the minor additional cost of a branch, which moreover can be predicted very well by the CPU, so the added cost should be almost zero. Furthermore, these branches do not happen in hot code paths. Hot paths are inside the cost function (which are unaffected) and in the linear algebra routines that Minuit2 uses (which are not instrumented with debug messages). ### Positive side-effects for wrappers and frontends. An important positive side effect for wrappers like iminuit is that we could show our users debug messages, too. Right now, we cannot, because DEBUG messages can only be enabled at compile-time, not at run-time. The DEBUG messages are also problematic in the current system, because they use std::cout while MnPrint uses the compile-time configurable MNLOG (which defaults",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421:3172,perform,performance,3172,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421,1,['perform'],['performance']

This 'simulates' the CMSSW framework running to ROOT output modules concurrently (represented by the `group.run(activity)` calls ). Within each of those 'modules' 10 new identical TBB tasks are launched and the waited upon. If a task from one 'module' ever is run on the thread of the other module (i.e. the thread doing the `group.wait()`) the program prints ""WRONG THREAD"". The program can be built with the options to; - Turn off task_arena isolation (-DNO_ISOLATE) at the 'module' level (this would represent removing such isolate calls in CMSSW); - Add another task arena (-DOTHER) which represents the global ROOT arena.; - Add task_arena isolate within the other arena (-DOTHER_ISOLATE) which would represent what would happen if ROOT internally called isolate within your own arena. The results are; - with only -DNO_ISOLATE see 'WRONG THREAD' message every time the program is run. This shows why CMS added the isolate; - with no other option, 'WRONG THREAD' is never seen; - with -DOTHER, see 'WRONG THREAD' every time >>> this is the case for ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14807#issuecomment-1971612644:2470,concurren,concurrently,2470,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14807#issuecomment-1971612644,1,['concurren'],['concurrently']

This reproducer should work on any machine with docker once you replace `PATH_FOR_REPRODUCING` with a suitable folder on your system. (The build includes LLVM+Clang debug information so it requires ~20GB of space and benefits from fast storage.). 1. Start a docker container with a directory mounted from the host (to make switching between CentOS 7 and 8 easier):. ```bash; PATH_FOR_REPRODUCING=/scratch2/root-debug2; mkdir -p ""$PATH_FOR_REPRODUCING""; docker run --rm -it -v ""$PATH_FOR_REPRODUCING"":""$PATH_FOR_REPRODUCING"" -w ""$PATH_FOR_REPRODUCING"" centos:7 bash; ```. 2.

Performance,"back port of https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12863. This problem appears ""only"" in newer OS/compiler (as seen in the original reports leading to #12715) the dependent library are now dlclose'd when the 'main' library is dlclose'd. In the example a cmake generated library is linked against `libHist` and `libHist` is then loaded and unloaded when the example's library is (intentionally) loaded and unloaded. `libHist` happens to share a STL collection's dictionary (`std::vector<TString>`) with `libCore` (and this collection is used for the reading of rootpcm files and thus during the loading of the example's library). . Details:. Unload only the TClass actually generated by the unloaded library. The TGenericClassInfo's destructor now passes the TClass that they actually generated in; addition to the name so that only that TClass is destroyed. This avoid the problem (seen in #12715) where 2 librares (`A` and `B`) have a dictionary for the same; STL collection (this is supported) and we have the following sequence of operation:. 1. load library A; 2. load library B (dictionary registration is ignored as intended); 3. request TClass for STL collection.; 4. unload (dclose) library B; 5. use TClass for STL collection. With the previous code, step 4. would lead to the TClass for STL; collection to be marked as ""unloaded"" even though it library (A); was still actually loaded. Fix reloading of library with a module. Prior to this fix, the in-memory rootpcm loaded as part of the module was removed; from memory on first use and thus if the library was closed and re-opened/loaded; we no longer had the information needed to restore the TClass object corresponding; to that library. This 2 changes fix #12715.

Performance,"ck with `readelf` reveals the runpath of the libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` is the reason for this problem. ```; $ readelf -a /usr/local/lib/root/libcppyy3_10.so | grep -i runpath; 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library runpath: [$ORIGIN:$ORIGIN/../lib/root]; ```. ```; $ readelf -a /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/libcppyy3_10.so | grep -i runpath; 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library runpath: [$ORIGIN:$ORIGIN/../lib/root]; ```. As you can see above, the libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` have the same runpath as the ones installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`, which shouldn't be the case if the two are different directories. ### Expected behavior; The libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` should have the runpath set to the correct relative location of `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` (`$ORIGIN/../../../lib/root` in the previous example). ### To Reproduce; 1. Configure the build with `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR` different from `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` and with rpath enabled.; 2. Compile and install as usual.; 3. Try to use the python modules installed by ROOT, such as by running `rootbrowse`. ### Setup; - ROOT version 6.26/06; - Ubuntu 22.04 running on WSL2; - ROOT installed from source with the build config command `CUDACXX=/usr/local/cuda-11.7/bin/nvcc cmake -C config.cmake .. -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES='86' -Dgnuinstall=ON -Dcuda=ON -Dcudnn=ON -Dtmva-gpu=ON -Dsoversion=ON -Dfortran=ON -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python -Drpath=ON`, where the file `config.cmake` contains; ```; set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR ""lib/python3.10/dist-packages"" CACHE PATH ""python libraries and modules (same as LIBDIR)""); set(CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR ""/etc/root"" CACHE PATH ""read-only single-machine data (etc/root)""); ```. ### Additional context; A temporary workaround while this issue is not resolved is to manually modify the runpath of the libraries installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR`, e.g. using `chrpath` or [`patchelf`](https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11431:3384,CACHE,CACHE,3384,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11431,2,['CACHE'],['CACHE']

Performance,"ckaging Guidelines some time ago added a section on packaging javascript files. This section says that minified scripts should be treated as compiled code. And like for programs written in other languages, pre-compiled code that is part of the sources must not be used in packaging, but must be regenerated from sources during the package build. I recently implemented these guidelines in the root package and found some issues. This pull request has three commits. 1) The word ""default"" is a reserved word in the language, and when used as a key in a dictionary it must be quoted. The yuicompressor minifier complains about this:; ```; $ yuicompressor etc/notebook/JsMVA/js/DecisionTree.js ; [ERROR] in etc/notebook/JsMVA/js/DecisionTree.js; 57:24:invalid property id; ```; 2. In one place (and one place only) in the script a construct from a very new version of the javascript standard is used for defining default values to function parameters. This unnecessarily makes the code incompatible with old browsers. It also makes it hard to run the minification during the package build as both yuicompressor and uglufyjs choke on it.; ```; $ yuicompressor etc/notebook/JsMVA/js/NeuralNetwork.js ; [ERROR] in etc/notebook/JsMVA/js/NeuralNetwork.js; 509:75:missing ) after formal parameters; ```; ```; $ uglifyjs etc/notebook/JsMVA/js/NeuralNetwork.js -c -m; Parse error at etc/notebook/JsMVA/js/NeuralNetwork.js:509,73; = function (divid, netobj, oldStructure=false) {; ^; SyntaxError: Unexpected token operator «=», expected punc «,»; ```; 3. The code has not been updated to reflect changes in jsroot. The code still tries to load d3.v3.min.js from jsroot. In the current version of jsroot the d3 script has been updated to version 4 and the file is now called d3.min.js. The pull request changes the name of the file in the two places where it is referenced, so it should now find the file. However this change is incomplete since the d3 API changes between the versions and some porting is needed.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1520:1640,load,load,1640,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1520,1,['load'],['load']
Performance,"clang might need to find a definition, that ""we"" might have.; But we need to find it based on a type name from clang, from a fwd decl;; or (as in ROOT-10804) based on a typename-from-typeid operation.; So register that as an alias!. The normalized-name-as-known-to-ROOT and typeid-name can be different,; for instance for inline namespaces: stripped by ROOT, kept by typeid. ROOT-10804 has a complex case where a lookup of a template argument failed; because it involves an inline namespace, and LHCb uses typeid demangling.; LHCb's case needed a nested name from a type (`LHCb::Event::v1::Track`); that failed to load because `v1` is an inline namespace, thus failing; instantiation of `KeyedContainer<LHCb::Event::v1::Track,Containers::KeyedObjectManager<Containers::hashmap> >` and making it invalid.; The transaction unloading then fails to completely remove this instantiation; (an unrelated bug), such that the remainders of the invalid decl are picked; up by a subsequent template instantiation which then asserts because of the; incomplete (invalid) declaration. We use the mangle/demangle trick from rootcling.; Now that multiple locations need it, just store it with the AnnotatedRecordDecl.; It will be needed for most classes; the overhead should be bearable.

So I think it makes sense to reduce top-level global variables, #includes and eagerly deserializations. 1. Global variables; If we break at emitModule, we can get a list of global variables and functions which are actually deserialized. These include functions, variables, STL classes and all the functions derives from them. I tried to change them to for example constexpr, so that it's processed at compile time.; 2. Eagerly Deserialized decls; Thanks to @Axel 's hint and tip, we could minimize eagerly deserialized decls deserialized in ASTReader::PassInterestingDeclsToConsumer. We already removed most of eagerly deserialized decls (Some are remaining to be removed, some are hard to remove and some don't cost a lot). So far, we got 9.2% of cpu time improvement, 15% real time improvement and 8.8% of memory improvement at start up time in release build. I took an average, but the variation of the real-time was very big. - root.exe -q -l; - master; cpu time = 0.09186914285714286 sec (average of 7 times); real time = 0.18371428571428572 sec (average of 7 times); res memory = 142.008 Mbytes. - HEAD; cpu time = 0.08337842857142856 sec; real time = 0.15685714285714286 sec; res memory = 129.508 Mbytes. - hsimple.C; Improved by 13% of cpu time and 8.5% of memory; - master; cpu time = 0.0954708 sec (average); res memory = 142.891 Mbytes. - HEAD; cpu time = 0.0833258 sec; res memory = 130.73 Mbytes.

Performance,"concatenation of pages from the same page-group can achieve.; - `RPageSinkDaos::CommitSealedPageVImpl()` maps pages from the same page-group to the same attribute key, thus concatenating them on the DAOS-side (i.e. relies on scatter-gathered I/O) until the cage limit is reached. The cage sizes can vary due to page compression and the length of page-groups, thus it is calculated and stored to be referenced when reading back.; - `RWOperation` is generalized to allow many IOVs associated with one attribute key in a request, enabling the non-contiguous buffers of sealed pages to be aggregated into a cage under the same position ID in the object store. ; - `RNTupleLocator`: leverages the changes introduced by PR #11828; all DAOS locators use the type `kDaos` and payload format `RNTupleLocatorObject64`. To locate pages within a cage, the 64-bit payload encodes the cage index in the LS half and the offset in the MS half. If caging is disabled, the offset remains zero, and each 'cage' is trivially the sealed page.; - Currently, there are no plans to enable support for page-wise reading without cluster caching if the desired page is caged, as that use-case is not performant and thus not recommended. Caged pages in DAOS should be accessed with the page buffering read option turned on. By disallowing the reading of a single caged page when the wrapping cage size is unknown, the cage sizes - or upper bounds for them - do not need to be passed to `RPageSourceDaos`; they are trivially devised in `RPageSourceDaos::LoadClusters()` by accessing all page locators in a buffered page-group. ; - `RPageSourceDaos::LoadClusters()` and `RPageSourceDaos::PopulatePageFromCluster()` extract the cage position and offset-in-cage from each sealed page's `RNTupleLocator::fPosition`.

Performance,"d in RClusterPool. To this end, an `RPageSink` is created at the beginning of the pipeline with the same header as the RNTuple being read. After the compressed cluster is retrieved in memory, its columns and pages are traversed and saved to the cached RNTuple. For now this feature can be reproduced with a very limited example, divided in three pieces; ### 1. Write an RNTuple; ```cpp; void write_ntuple(); {; auto model = RNTupleModel::Create();; auto myintfield = model->MakeField<int>(""myintfield"");; auto myintfieldsquared = model->MakeField<int>(""myintfieldsquared"");. std::string_view ntuplename{""myntuple""};; std::string_view filename{""myntuple.root""};; auto ntuple = RNTupleWriter::Recreate(std::move(model), ntuplename, filename);. constexpr int nentries = 10;; for (int i = 0; i < nentries; i++) {; *myintfield = i;; *myintfieldsquared = i*i;; ntuple->Fill();; // Create a cluster every 5 entries; if (i == 4 || i == 9) ntuple->CommitCluster();; }; }; ```; ### 2. Read the RNTuple (this will create a `cachedntuple.root` file); ```cpp; void read_ntuple(); {; std::string_view ntuplename{""myntuple""};; std::string_view filename{""myntuple.root""};; auto ntuple = RNTupleReader::Open(ntuplename, filename);. for (auto entryid: *ntuple){; ntuple->LoadEntry(entryid);; }; }; ```; ### 3. Print info of the cached RNTuple; ```cpp; void read_cache(); {; std::string_view ntuplename{""myntuple""};; std::string_view filename{""cachedntuple.root""};. auto model = RNTupleModel::Create();; auto myintfield = model->MakeField<int>(""myintfield"");; auto myintfieldsquared = model->MakeField<int>(""myintfieldsquared"");; auto ntuple = RNTupleReader::Open(std::move(model), ntuplename, filename);; ntuple->PrintInfo();. for (auto entryid: *ntuple){; ntuple->LoadEntry(entryid);; std::cout << ""Read entry "" << entryid << "" with value "" << *myintfield << ""\n"";; std::cout << ""Read entry "" << entryid << "" with value "" << *myintfieldsquared << ""\n"";; }; }; ```. ## TODOS. 1.

Currently only one can be used at a time. --all-branches; Reads every branch from the specified files and TTrees.; --branches bname1 [bname2...]; Reads the branches with matching names. Will error if any of the branches are not found.; --branches-regex bregex1 [bregex2 ...]; Reads any branches with a name matching the provided regex. Will error if any provided regex does not match at least one branch. Meta arguments:; --threads nthreads; The number of threads to use for file reading. Will automatically cap to the number of available threads on the machine.; --tasks-per-worker ntasks; The number of tasks to generate for each worker thread when using multithreading. Description:. rootreadspeed is a tool used to help identify bottlenecks in ROOT analysis programs by providing an idea of what throughput you can expect when reading ROOT files in certain configurations. It does this by providing information about the number of bytes read from your files, how long this takes, and the different throughputs in MB/s, both in total and per thread. Compressed vs Uncompressed Throughput:. Throughput speeds are provided as compressed and uncompressed - ROOT files are usually saved in compressed format, so these will often differ. Compressed bytes is the total number of bytes read from TFiles during the readspeed test (possibly including meta-data). Uncompressed bytes is the number of bytes processed by reading the branch values in the TTree. Throughput is calculated as the total number of bytes over the total runtime (including decompression time) in the uncompressed and compressed cases. Interpreting results:. There are three possible scenarios when using rootreadspeed, namely:. 1. The 'Real Time' is significantly lower than your own analysis runtime.; This would imply your actual application code is dominating the runtime of your analysis, ie. your analysis logic or framework is taking up the time. The best way to decrease the runtime would b",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14039:2093,throughput,throughputs,2093,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14039,1,['throughput'],['throughputs']

So it seems to likely have something to do with #12857. Oddly, it does not seem to affect my system ROOT version (packaged by Fedora) which is also ROOT 6.28.06 and presumably built with Python 3.11, suggesting that there may be something complicated going on (I was only building my own ROOT in hopes of reproducing @clark2668's problem). None of the patches Fedora applies seem to be relevant, but probably there are differences in compilation flags. .

The memory management of such objects is handled in the subsequent call to `ROOT::Internal::RDF::Jit*Helper` functions. The code to invoke is booked with the RLoopManager via [`lm->ToJitExec`](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/e83e0e94a5e10f2cb97a5ff9cb57d5de0d25b9e5/tree/dataframe/src/RDFInterfaceUtils.cxx#L686) but is not compiled and executed right away. The cling invokation only happens in [`RLoopManager::Jit`](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/e83e0e94a5e10f2cb97a5ff9cb57d5de0d25b9e5/tree/dataframe/src/RLoopManager.cxx#L804), which gets all the code previously declared by *any* RDataFrame within the same application via the singleton returned by [`GetCodeToJit`](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/e83e0e94a5e10f2cb97a5ff9cb57d5de0d25b9e5/tree/dataframe/src/RLoopManager.cxx#L67). The fact that all the code from all the RDatFrame objects is JITted at the same time is an optimization, but it has a fragility. In case an RDataFrame books some JITted operation but the computation graph is never triggered, it will leak memory of those objects that were created on the heap but never freed by the corresponding helper functions. Furthermore, those objects in turn are connected to their respective RDataFrame object, which meanwhile can already be gone out of scope. ### Reproducer. ```cpp; #include <ROOT/RDataFrame.hxx>; #include <iostream>; #include <TFile.h>; #include <TTree.h>; #include <ROOT/RLogger.hxx>. auto verbosity = ROOT::Experimental::RLogScopedVerbosity(ROOT::Detail::RDF::RDFLogChannel(), ROOT::Experimental::ELogLevel::kDebug + 10);. int main(); {. {; std::cout << ""Begin scope\n"";; ROOT::RDataFrame rdf(1);; auto df1 = rdf.Define(""x"", ""42"");; std::cout << ""End scope\n"";; }; }; ```.

Performance,"dd the following code:. ```.diff; + TDirectory::TContext context;; currentFile_.reset(TFile::Open(filename.c_str()));; ```. Although this fixes the problem for us, Philippe encouraged me to open up an issue to address this limitation. A slightly adjusted history of the relevant email correspondence is below. ----. Hi Kyle,. On the first user TFile destruction, the destructors is executed (in my case) on Thread 3 (see gdb output below) but the file is the current directory in Thread 1. The point where the file is opened and Thread 1's gDirectory is set is described in the stack trace below. It is likely that the problem is solved by adding:. TDirectory::TContext ctxt;. at the start of `art::RootIOPolicy::openAndReadMetaData`. This will insure that the new created file pointer is 'forgotten' by Thread 1's gDirectory and thus it should solve the problem. Cheers,; Philippe. ```; === gdb output.

Since RDataFrame **is not** the dataset itself, but just an interface to it, it still needs to open the file where the dataset is contained and read data from it. Thus, merging two RDF objects would still involve ` opening each file and saving them. Then loading them again and merging, then saving again` as you say above. Or at least the loading, merging and saving again part, if we consider that the part of your example where you create two files from scratch and save data into them with RDF could also just have been opening already existing files written by some other application before the merging. In fact the solution you provide follows exactly these steps:; > ; > ```python; > # Opening files and loading pre-existing datasets; > df_1=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_1); > df_2=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_2); > ; > # creating new columns in the datasets; > df_1=df_1.Define('identity', '+1'); > df_2=df_2.Define('identity', '+2'); > ; > # Merging the datasets in memory; > df_3 = df_1.Merge(df_2); > # Opening a new file and save the merged dataset into the new file; > df_3.Snapshot('tree', 'file.root'); > ```; > ; > I admit that I might not be able to see some internal optimizations that RDF might do while merging, but the logical steps seem to be equivalent to me. Or I also might be misinterpreting your proposal. No, the approaches are different. In the approach without `RDataFrame::Merge` I save twice the modified trees with the new column added, so the whole thing is slower than the second approach where the looping and saving can be done only once. . > ; > ## Current possible approaches; > If you need to process a dataset with RDF and need t",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927331768:2026,load,loading,2026,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927331768,2,['load'],['loading']
Performance,"e in ALICE, in which the parallel world ""scene"" can be very large (~100K volumes). In this case, TGeoVoxelFinder takes very long; to construct and consumes a very large amount of memory (GBs). In addition, the evaluation of the Safety function dominates the Geant simulation time. The improvements in this commit are mainly achieved through:. * The use of a boundary volume hierarchy (BVH) as the base acceleration entity, replacing TGeoVoxelFinder.; BVH are the standard in industry/computer-graphics, for what concerns ray-object intersection tasks. The BVH is constructed from axis-aligned bounding boxes and employed in the FindBoundary/FindNode implementations. * The use of a 3D voxel grid (TGeoVoxelGrid) structure, able to store properties ""local"" or in the vicinity of a cartesian coordinate P. This structure allows to reduce the (typical) algorithmic complexity for ""Safety"" queries to ~O(1) (with a constant factor determined by the voxel size). Filling of the 3D voxel grid cache for Safety is done on-the-fly (using the BVH once). * (Optional) Additional caching of ""last-call"" safety values for really quick return when the value is still valid at the next call. Ideas for these improvements come from prior work in related libraries such as VecGeom. -----. Implementation details:. * The implementation is, for now (until fully tested), provided in a backward compatible manner:. - By default, nothing changes; - Users have to activate the BVH mode by setting an environment variable TGEO_PW_USEBVH; - Users may hence compare the 2 modes. * Functions for Safety, FindNode, FindBoundary dispatch to some internal implementation. This causes an extra lookup/jump, which can be removed once BVH is fully validated. * For the BVH, a well known open source implementation is included in header-only form. The headers are copied from https://github.com/madmann91/bvh commit 66e445b92f68801a6dd8ef943fe3038976ecb4ff. * A new class, TGeoVoxelGrid is provided for the cartesian VoxelGrid contai",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16442:1359,cache,cache,1359,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16442,1,['cache'],['cache']

Performance,"e it back upstream.; > ; > I think all of us appreciate the time and brain power Vincenzo invests in improving the code. I bet it's useful to propose changes coming out of this upstream where relevant, @sudo-panda ?. Hi @Axel-Naumann ,. I am really grateful to @vepadulano for investing his precious time in reviewing this PR and suggesting changes to improve it. If not for his suggestions about the `namespace NumbaExt` code, I wouldn't have been able to simplify it. On the other hand, @vgvassilev is right about the global statements being a non-critical change and wouldn't be accepted upstream. And I am sure when he said that, he didn't mean that Vincenzo's efforts were wasteful. Finally, AFAIU Vincenzo thinks that global statements are unnecessary because the code acts in the same way whether you keep them or not. I have a few counterpoints to this:. 1. It gives programmers an idea about where the variable was initialized before use. Modifying the code provided by Vincenzo:. ```python; cache = {}. def foo():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""foo""] = 1. .....; .... Many lines of code ...; ..... def bar():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""bar""] = 2; ```. I hope you can see it becomes difficult to understand where did cache come from. A `global cache` statement at the top of the function or before its use clarifies the intent. 2. Removing the `global` statement doesn't affect the scope of the variable. It is purely meant to [guide Python for the code block it is used in.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement). 3. ROOT already uses `global` keyword in [JupyROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root/blame/a90d76b7798dc4332425d29794089fceaebccb60/bindings/jupyroot/python/JupyROOT/helpers/utils.py#L126 ).

Performance,"e result of the RDataFrame execution should know how to merge itself with another result of the same type and the result of the merge operation should still know how to merge again. To this end, a new function called `GetMergeableValue` takes as input an RResultPtr<T> , e.g. the last action node of the graph, and returns an `RMergeableValue<T>*`, a new class that satisfies the previous requirements. The choice of creating a new class instead of, for example, returning the standard return value plus a function to merge two values of that type, has to do with the second requirement above.; In fact, while this could be feasible with the return value of a `Count` operation (the merge function would just be the sum of the two count values), it would not be enough for all operations.; Notably, to merge results of two `Mean` operations we would need also the counts of each mean to merge them as a weighted mean, so the function would take 4 parameters of which at most 2 are known beforehand (the mean and the counts of the action that is currently being examined by the GetMergeableValue function), while the other 2 parameters wouldn't be known until the user tries to perform the Merge on the two values. RMergeableValue is created after the execution of the computation graph from the information contained in the various action helpers in ""tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/ActionHelpers.hxx"".; RMergeableValue itself is a base class, with RMergeableGenericAction as the derived class that is mostly used to get the right information from the helpers, e.g. the value of the action and a function to merge two of those values. For specific actions that require more information, e.g. `Mean`, more derived classes can be created, e.g. `RMergeableMean`. The class instances are passed as void* up the call chain: ActionHelper-->RAction-->RActionBase-->ROOT::Detail::RDF::GetMergeableValue(); In the function they are `static_cast`ed back to their correct RMergeableValue<T>* type.

If the dot is _not_ at the; start of a path component (e.g., `LIBDIR=foo.libs`), then all is; fine. . So it seems that somewhere deep in the ROOT code, there is some; assumption about a dot (`.`) as the leading character of a; sub-directory name which shouldn't be there. As far as I can tell,; the dot makes the code think that the library loaded is the ROOT; executable (`<ROOTSYS>/bin/root.exe`) rather than the actual shared; library. The reason seems to be that, because of some bad stripping; of path components, the shared library isn't found by Cling and then; the binary image falls back to the executable binary image. . ## Why this is problematic . Many build tools (e.g., Autotools) uses temporary directories that; start with a dot (`.`), including for building examples and tests. The; current behaviour of ROOT prevents building production level packages; with these tools that has rigorous test suites and rich examples. .

Performance,"eInterpVar` and the `PiecewiseInterpolation` classes in; HistFactory can both interpolate asymmetric up-and-down variations; between the +/- one standard deviation such that both the first and; second derivatives of the scale factors are smooth. The `PiecewiseInterpolation` class is more general, because instead of; taking constant interpolation parameters, it takes other `RooAbsReals`.; That means it makes no sense for that class to cache the polynomial; coefficients that have to re recomputed anyway each time the input; changes. It uses an optimized formula to do the interpolation on the; fly. The `FlexibleInterpVar` however precomputes and caches the polynomial; coefficients. This has serveral disadvantages:. * High cost in memory (the big ATLAS models can have thousands of; `FlexibleInterpVars`. * It's inconsistent with the `PiecewiseInterpolation`, which should be; equivalent. * Most importantly, and this was the motivation for this PR now:; when we do the code generation for AD, we can't pre-compute cached; coefficients because it would bloat the generated code with constant; arrays. Computing on the fly is much more AD-friendly. Validation of the new `FlexibleInterpVar` values for `low=0.9` and; `high=1.2` that shows the interpolated values are agreeing to the 5e-4; level. This is completely accepatable for such an ad-hoc polynomial; motivation, where the shape is not given by any physical meaning anyway; but just by the continuity condition at the boundaries. And at the; boundaries (and `param=0`), the difference between both implementations; goes to zero. It was also checked that this change has no performance; effect on fitting the full ATLAS Higgs combination modes. ```txt; param ref new diff_abs diff_rel; 0 -1.00 0.9000000000 0.9000000000 0.0000000000 0.00E+00; 1 -0.95 0.9047424331 0.9047437816 0.0000013485 1.49E-06; 2 -0.85 0.9140836603 0.9141118876 0.0000282273 3.09E-05; 3 -0.75 0.9230659064 0.9231653329 0.0000994265 1.08E-04; 4 -0.65 0.9317147727 0.93",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13067:1033,cache,cached,1033,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13067,1,['cache'],['cached']

Performance,"eant to be treated like a TTree. Otherwise I would also have to say that RDF is meant to be treated like a CSV file or something similar. > there should be a function that allows us to merge them. If I have to think about this function you propose, I don't see it going much further than the example you already have above. Since RDataFrame **is not** the dataset itself, but just an interface to it, it still needs to open the file where the dataset is contained and read data from it. Thus, merging two RDF objects would still involve ` opening each file and saving them. Then loading them again and merging, then saving again` as you say above. Or at least the loading, merging and saving again part, if we consider that the part of your example where you create two files from scratch and save data into them with RDF could also just have been opening already existing files written by some other application before the merging. In fact the solution you provide follows exactly these steps:; ```python; # Opening files and loading pre-existing datasets; df_1=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_1); df_2=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_2). # creating new columns in the datasets; df_1=df_1.Define('identity', '+1'); df_2=df_2.Define('identity', '+2'). # Merging the datasets in memory; df_3 = df_1.Merge(df_2); # Opening a new file and save the merged dataset into the new file; df_3.Snapshot('tree', 'file.root'); ```. I admit that I might not be able to see some internal optimizations that RDF might do while merging, but the logical steps seem to be equivalent to me. Or I also might be misinterpreting your proposal. ## Current possible approaches. If you need to process a dataset with RDF and need to concatenate parts of it, the current best approach is to use the `RDataFrame(TTree &tree)` constructor after having created the correct tree with all the information you need. If for example you need to concatenate vertically 2 or more TTrees (i.e. if all have the same schema with column",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927091065:1727,load,loading,1727,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927091065,1,['load'],['loading']

Performance,"ecks; the .gnu.hash section in ELF which is the GNU implementation of a bloom; filter and uses it. If the symbol is not in the bloom filter, the; implementation builds its own and uses it. The measured performance of the; bloom filter is 30% speed up for 2mb more memory. The custom bloom filter on; top of the .gnu.hash filter gives 1-2% better performance.; The advantage for the custom bloom filter is that it works on all; implementations which do not support .gnu.hash (windows and osx). It is also; customizable if we want to further reduce the false positive rates; (currently at p=2%).; * Hash table optimization -- we build a hash table which contains all symbols; for a given library. This allows us to avoid the fallback symbol iteration; if multiple symbols from the same library are requested.

Performance,"ed as integers.; Every state index also has a state name attached, but instead of storing; it in each row of the dataset, the mapping from state index to; state name is now stored in the category class. **For reviewers**:; Although there is a lot of noise, that's mostly getting rid of unnecessary classes. The user-facing interfaces are stable (to be proven by the fact that all the rest of RooFit still compiles, and that tutorials run).; This is the chance to modernise/improve the `RooCategory` interface. It would be nice if you could specifically look at `RooCategory.h`, maybe in conjunction with the modernised tutorial on how they can be used in the future:; https://github.com/hageboeck/root/blob/cleanupCategories/tutorials/roofit/rf404_categories.C. More details what happened:; - Replace RooCatType by an integer.; - Replace names saved in each instance of RooCatType by a map in; RooAbsCategory that maps state numbers to strings. This saves 64 bytes; + the size of TObject for each event, and makes loading strings in each; event unnecessary.; - Convert RooVectorDataStore from saving RooCatType to integers of; category states.; - With this, also reduce the amount of unnecessary members in RooVectorDataStore. - Provide new interfaces for categories to work without RooCatType.; - Prevent clearing of shapeDirty in RooAbsCategory::evaluate(), since; derived category classes might need to recompute their shapes if one; of their input categories change.; - Add function to define multiple category states at once with; initialiser lists. - Mark legacy interfaces exposing RooCatType as deprecated in doxygen.; - Stop including RooCatType when R__LESS_INCLUDES is set.; - Flag legacy interface with R__SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE.; - Create RooCatType instances on-demand in case users continue to use; the legacy interface. - Consolidate RooMultiCategory and RooSuperCategory. These share almost; all the code, so RooSuperCategory will now use a RooMultiCategory for; state definition and ret",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5219:1358,load,loading,1358,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5219,1,['load'],['loading']

The enum-based optimization which I introduced in commit [""Improve performance by allowing most of cling::Value to inline""](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11252/commits/fa74b5419c3120ab4b5130e53a1844c54dc467c4). Unfortunately it did not show any improvement for callfunc. It helps with inlining the `castAs` operation but that does not bring benefits. That's why I decided to revert it but keep it in the history if we want to apply it. I can further spend time in trying to optimize this but that might be at the cost of making it harder to understand and maintain. If that performance info is acceptable, I will play a bit with a couple of ideas I have and move forward as that's blocking lowering parts of CallFunc to cling standalone. fyi @Axel-Naumann",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11252#issuecomment-1252723800:7690,optimiz,optimization,7690,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11252#issuecomment-1252723800,4,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimization', 'optimize', 'performance']"

Performance,"eighted samples. It should be clarified both in the code documentation and in the user guide, if the implementation can handle weighted templates in the asymptotic limit, by applying the SPD approximation discussed by Bohm and Zech, 2014. This is possible (as we show in our paper https://inspirehep.net/literature/2512593), but only if the implementations handles this special case. Conway's paper does not discuss weighted templates and does not explain how to use the SPD approximation in this context. Long version:. The code documentation of RooBarlowBeestonLL on the master is incorrect. It is stated that this class implements the Barlow-Beeston likelihood computation, but it actually implements an approximation introduced by Conway in 2011. The approximation is only asymptotically equivalent to Barlow-Beeston, for small samples it is inferior. We recently published a paper about a new approximation to Barlow-Beeston (https://inspirehep.net/literature/2512593), which is fast to compute and can be used with weighted templates and weighted data. In this paper, we compare the performance of Barlow-Beeston and several approximations including ours. It is shown there, that Conway's approximation is inferior to the exact computation by Barlow-Beeston. I was pointed to this class by the LHCb collaboration. There is uncertainty in the community what this class actually computes and whether it is asymptotically correct for weighted templates. I kindly ask to correct and extend the documentation. **I think the best solution is to revert the implementation of BarlowBeestonLL to actually implement the original BarlowBeeston.** Then make a new class called ConwayLL which implements Conway's approximation. I am happy to provide another class which implements our method in ROOT. So far, the reference implementation is in the iminuit Python package. ### ROOT version.

Performance,"el 3 would enable the debug messages that are currently only available when the compiler flag DEBUG is defined. In my experience, trouble with minimizing some function is common so it would be a great asset to enable more debug output at anytime by just increasing the print level without recompiling ROOT. The DEBUG messages are particularly problematic in the current system, because they use std::cout while MnPrint uses the compile-time configurable MNLOG (which defaults to std::cerr). ### Possible negative side-effects. #### Breaking changes?. This proposal does not change the output for print level 0, but there is a minor change for print level 1. It changes the output of scripts/software that uses print level 1, because previously level 1 meant ""print errors and info"" while in the new hierarchy it means ""print errors and warnings"". I think this is a minor effect, which has to be documented in the next changelog but it cannot cause backward incompatibilities or breakage. #### Reduced performance?. The impact on performance is expected to be negligible. I propose to place additional calls into the compiled code for everyone, but these calls are not executed unless the user picks a high print level. For a low print level, there is just the minor additional cost of a branch, which moreover can be predicted very well by the CPU, so the added cost should be almost zero. Furthermore, these branches do not happen in hot code paths. Hot paths are inside the cost function (which are unaffected) and in the linear algebra routines that Minuit2 uses (which are not instrumented with debug messages). ### Positive side-effects for wrappers and frontends. An important positive side effect for wrappers like iminuit is that we could show our users debug messages, too. Right now, we cannot, because DEBUG messages can only be enabled at compile-time, not at run-time. The DEBUG messages are also problematic in the current system, because they use std::cout while MnPrint uses the compil",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421:3144,perform,performance,3144,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6421,1,['perform'],['performance']

Performance,"elevant, @sudo-panda ?. Hi @Axel-Naumann ,. I am really grateful to @vepadulano for investing his precious time in reviewing this PR and suggesting changes to improve it. If not for his suggestions about the `namespace NumbaExt` code, I wouldn't have been able to simplify it. On the other hand, @vgvassilev is right about the global statements being a non-critical change and wouldn't be accepted upstream. And I am sure when he said that, he didn't mean that Vincenzo's efforts were wasteful. Finally, AFAIU Vincenzo thinks that global statements are unnecessary because the code acts in the same way whether you keep them or not. I have a few counterpoints to this:. 1. It gives programmers an idea about where the variable was initialized before use. Modifying the code provided by Vincenzo:. ```python; cache = {}. def foo():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""foo""] = 1. .....; .... Many lines of code ...; ..... def bar():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""bar""] = 2; ```. I hope you can see it becomes difficult to understand where did cache come from. A `global cache` statement at the top of the function or before its use clarifies the intent. 2. Removing the `global` statement doesn't affect the scope of the variable. It is purely meant to [guide Python for the code block it is used in.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement). 3. ROOT already uses `global` keyword in [JupyROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root/blame/a90d76b7798dc4332425d29794089fceaebccb60/bindings/jupyroot/python/JupyROOT/helpers/utils.py#L126 ). So unless ""we should never use `global`"" is a new convention being followed in ROOT, I believe it doesn't seem to track. 4. As seen in this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4693392), Python used to differentiate between having a global statement or not. And even though the answer is more than ten years old, I experienced this firsthand when I started using Python (about four years b",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11096#issuecomment-1603484912:1242,cache,cache,1242,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11096#issuecomment-1603484912,2,['cache'],['cache']

I suspect the reason is because #785 in the following function:. https://github.com/zzxuanyuan/root/blob/15cceff19b48dfe4a4b0c69c1ec07ea75bd1ccb5/tree/tree/src/TTreeCacheUnzip.cxx#L708. CreateTasks() explicitly creates 2 tasks (empty_task and MappingTask; and set_ref_count(2) means 2 tasks in total). The scheduler might make a better decision here since it knows there will be only one task except empty_task running in future. On the other hand, TTaskGroup uses tbb::task_group which calls the following function:. https://github.com/01org/tbb/blob/b9805bacadd4d0474fd3358cf0c7153042ce50c3/include/tbb/task_group.h#L108. task_group_base() also first creates a empty_task. However, it only creates 1 task(itself) by setting reference count as 1 (set_ref_count(1)). When it invoke another task by calling . https://github.com/01org/tbb/blob/b9805bacadd4d0474fd3358cf0c7153042ce50c3/include/tbb/task_group.h#L103. allocate_additional_child() will create a new task as child and increment reference count by 1. I guess accumulating tasks on-the-fly might degrade the performance since the tbb scheduler could spend more time on finding tasks to work on. In a short, I think explicitly defining the total number of tasks and task graph should have better performance (more efficient for scheduler I guess) than adding more tasks to task_group as the program runs. There are two alternative approaches that might improve the performance. ; 1. Since we have already know we will only have one task (except empty_task) to add into the task_group, we could revise TTaskGroup interface and notify it what task is going to run in advance.; 2. We could get rid of TTaskGroup in my current implemention and synchronously map baskets to different tasks. If we do not mind a little performance drops, the current implementation should be fine.

Performance,"entation of; the full path to shared objects allowing search at constant time O(1). This; also fixes issues when resolving symbols from OSX where the system libraries; contain multiple levels of symlinks.; * Bloom filter optimization -- it uses a stohastic data structure which gives; a definitive answer if a symbol is not in the set. The implementation checks; the .gnu.hash section in ELF which is the GNU implementation of a bloom; filter and uses it. If the symbol is not in the bloom filter, the; implementation builds its own and uses it. The measured performance of the; bloom filter is 30% speed up for 2mb more memory. The custom bloom filter on; top of the .gnu.hash filter gives 1-2% better performance.; The advantage for the custom bloom filter is that it works on all; implementations which do not support .gnu.hash (windows and osx). It is also; customizable if we want to further reduce the false positive rates; (currently at p=2%).; * Hash table optimization -- we build a hash table which contains all symbols; for a given library. This allows us to avoid the fallback symbol iteration; if multiple symbols from the same library are requested. The hash table; optimization targets to optimize the case where the bloom filter tells us; the symbol is *maybe* in the library. Patch by Alexander Penev (@alexander-penev) and me!.

Performance,"er. I have made a new commit, which addresses your and @hageboeck's review comments as much as possible. Point by point, let me quickly explain what changed:. - ""Upgraded"" comments on new functionality to doxygen. I did not doxygen document everything, because most functionality was copy-pasted from the old RooMinimizerFcn. The new things are now documented though.; - Renamed snake_case to dromedary.; - Use unique_ptr for parameter lists, as suggested by Stephan.; - Remove a few obsolete __ROOFIT_NOROOMINIMIZER flags (I guess these are part of the merge conflicts).; - I realized that part of what I changed in PR #8596 could (and imho should) have been introduced here already. I moved functionality to RooAbsMinimizerFcn, namely storage of the to-be-minimized function and constant term optimization information, but did not yet remove it (in this PR) from RooMinimizer. Now it has been removed.; - While going over the above, I realized I had actually *completely* forgot to add back in a backwards compatible way of enabling offsetting for numerical precision! This has now been correctly added back in. Then, about what I did not change:. - I did not have time for doing the include reordering/optimization that @hageboeck suggested. I tried to quickly figure it out, but I couldn't change things fast enough and still be able to guarantee that everything will still work in the later PRs that build on this one. I agree it would be nice, but I hope we can postpone this to some future PR, perhaps after the other additions have been merged.; - As mentioned earlier, RooAbsMinimizerFcn is basically a way to reduce code duplication. This should be seen in light of RooGradMinimizerFcn as well (see again PR #8596) and will also be used for a later addition. I think removing all data members and also the protected vs private suggestion would complicate this goal. I think it's good to merge like this (after fixing the conflict of course), but let me know if you have further suggestions!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8569#issuecomment-875559598:1262,optimiz,optimization,1262,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8569#issuecomment-875559598,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

The snapshot test has 2 steps:. 1. Do the work, including a call to SnapshotImpl which contains the problem line, with only compiled code; 2. Do the same work relying on interpreted code, in which case SnapshotImpl is called via the interpreter. The symptoms of the failure is that **if** the snapshot test is compiled with optimization then. a. The compiled version works fine; b. In the interpreted version the constructor of the RInterface is wrong because the shared_ptr its constructor sees is **not** initialized. If the snapshot test is compiled without optimization then both steps succeeds.

Performance,"es/5286101/mwe.tar.gz). The gist is that the event here is a simple class: ; ```. #ifndef _mwe_event_h; #define _mwe_event_h. #include ""TObject.h"" ; #include <array>. class MWEEvent ; {. public: ; MWEEvent() { iev =-1; bar=-1; foo[0] =-1; foo[1]=-1; } . // workaround for not being able to access foo directly ; double get_foo(int i) const { return foo[i]; } . int iev; ; double bar; ; double foo[2]; ; virtual ~MWEEvent() { ; } . ClassDef(MWEEvent,1);; }; ; ```. A tree of these objects can be read with PyROOT fine if only the scalar members are touched, or the getter is used:. ```; import ROOT . ROOT.gSystem.Load(""build/libmwe.so"") . f = ROOT.TFile(""out.root""); ; t = f.Get(""tree""); . ev = ROOT.MWEEvent() . t.SetBranchAddress(""event"",ev) . for i in range(10): ; t.GetEntry(i); ; print (ev.iev) ; print (ev.bar) ; print (ev.get_foo(0)); print (ev.get_foo(1)); ```. But if you try to access the array member directly (as used to work), it does not work:; ```; import ROOT . ROOT.gSystem.Load(""build/libmwe.so"") . f = ROOT.TFile(""out.root""); ; t = f.Get(""tree""); . ev = ROOT.MWEEvent() . t.SetBranchAddress(""event"",ev) . for i in range(10): ; t.GetEntry(i); ; print (ev.iev) ; print (ev.bar) ; print (ev.foo[0]); print (ev.foo[1]). ```.
