When the pair or map are instantiated (eg. `gInterpreter->Declare(""pair<...> pl"")`),; the TClass for the pair is informed (via `TCling::UpdateClassInfoWithDecl`; and `TCling::RefreshClassInfo`). We could update `RefreshClassInfo` to refresh the `StreamerInfo` for the pair; but it would also need to also refresh the map's CollectionProxy (size,; hints, etc?) [and there is an arbitrary number because they are thread-local]. So at that point, it might actually be better to recreate the TClass for the; map ...

I do see some drastic improvements for some of our workflows (250MB out of 1GB) where we have many processes initialising the interpreter.

Simply opening a file does show improvement as well (I am down to 49MB, when I also patch the FileInfo vector in the HeaderSearch). The PR somehow seems to die with some old memory corruption which I am pretty sure I fixed and I cannot reproduce anymore. Is there any need to clean some cache?.

Performance,"For the record, one such discussion yield the following:. a) Update the merging operation (if not already done) to make sure that the output file is kept open during the length of the process (this is to avoid re-reading the output TTree from the output file) and the TTree is written to the output file only once at the end. b) CMSSW can detect when a 'merge' operation was requested by checking the return value of Fill and the number of entry: if Fill succeed and the TTree has zero entries afterwards then a merge operation was requested (the TTree was reset). c) We need to call a callback (std::function) provided at CMS when a merge operation is completed (i.e all its baskets are on the output file and the output TTree has been updated accordingly). d) When CMSSW noticed that a 'merge' operation has been requested, it will shutdown the CMSSW output module (make it unavailable to other modules). This guarantees that if CMSSW has N output modules, there will be at most N queued merge operations and while the merge are going on only 1 thread is used for it (and the other N-1 can be used for other CMSSW work). e) We need to implement a queuing of the merge operations tasks without relying on the ROOT global write lock. See for example the way something similar is done in CSMSW: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/FWCore/Concurrency/interface/SerialTaskQueue.h. f) CMSSW need to call a 'finalization' API to 'close-out' the output file (without this call the output file is useless).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1866#issuecomment-387769514:983,queue,queued,983,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1866#issuecomment-387769514,2,"['Concurren', 'queue']","['Concurrency', 'queued']"

All I had was this hint by valgrind when checked the reproducer in the commit message:; ```; Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s); at 0x402E09: TStorage::UpdateIsOnHeap(unsigned int const volatile&, unsigned int volatile&) (TStorage.h:132); by 0x501B33D: TDirectory::TDirectory() (in /usr/lib64/root/libCore.so.6.26.10); by 0x5816D81: TDirectoryFile::TDirectoryFile() (in /usr/lib64/root/libRIO.so.6.26.10); by 0x5833AF8: TFile::TFile(char const*, char const*, char const*, int) (in /usr/lib64/root/libRIO.so.6.26.10); by 0xE2D86A6: TCling::LoadPCM(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >) (in /usr/lib64/root/libCling.so.6.26.10); by 0xE2D9A17: TCling::RegisterModule(char const*, char const**, char const**, char const*, char const*, void (*)(), std::vector<std::pair<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >,; allocator<std::pair<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >, int> > > const&, char const**, bool, bool) (in /usr/lib64/root/libCling.so.6.26.10); by 0x4FF098E: TROOT::InitInterpreter() (in /usr/lib64/root/libCore.so.6.26.10); by 0x4FF0C9E: ROOT::Internal::GetROOT2() (in /usr/lib64/root/libCore.so.6.26.10); by 0x510209C: ROOT::TGenericClassInfo::GetClass() (in /usr/lib64/root/libCore.so.6.26.10); by 0x90B67CA: TFoamCell::Class() (in /usr/lib64/root/libFoam.so.6.26.10); by 0x504BE7A: TRef::operator=(TObject*) (in /usr/lib64/root/libCore.so.6.26.10); by 0x90B126F: TFoamCell::Fill(int, TFoamCell*, TFoamCell*, TFoamCell*) (in /usr/lib64/root/libFoam.so.6.26.10); Uninitialised value was created by a stack allocation; at 0xE2D8106: TCling::LoadPCM(std::__cxx11::basic_string<",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12061#issuecomment-1397463096:832,Load,LoadPCM,832,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12061#issuecomment-1397463096,1,['Load'],['LoadPCM']

Performance,"Ha, that was again a nice rabbit hole. Here's a summary of what I found:; 1. We'll never run into problems with GCC's `libstdc++` since [version 4.5](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.5/changes.html): ""The default behavior for comparing typeinfo names has changed, so in `<typeinfo>`, `__GXX_MERGED_TYPEINFO_NAMES` now defaults to zero"", which means that `operator==` performs the string comparison in all cases.; 2. `libc++` by now has three different implementations: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/066b8f2fc6d584635a017a0a15494ce4460744e3/libcxx/include/typeinfo#L120-L169 For all platforms except Windows and Apple M1, the library ""assume[s] the Itanium C++ ABI and use[s] the Unique implementation"". This may be fine for compiled programs where the linker can unify the `type_info`s, but not if the JIT emits a new copy. I have yet to find an example where this can go wrong, it would be great to have a test that fails if somebody attempts to ""simplify"" things. For this particular method however, the Itanium ABI mandates that the `std::type_info` objects of the checked types live in the run-time support library: https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#rtti-emission With exactly one object for those types, even `operator==` cannot mess up.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7776#issuecomment-823939722:360,perform,performs,360,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7776#issuecomment-823939722,2,['perform'],['performs']

Performance,"Here's an explanation that at least satisfies me: I added a `module->dump();` to `IncrementalJIT::addModule()` so that I can see what code is handed over to LLVM when just starting `./bin/root -q -l`. My understanding is that this comes from the dicts that are loaded on startup. Looking for `GetPoolSize`, here's the relevant part of the LLVM IR:; ```llvm; ; Function Attrs: noinline uwtable; define i32 @_ZNK4ROOT8Internal9TExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::Internal::TExecutor""*) #0 align 2 {; ; contains calls to; %seq = call i32 @_ZNK4ROOT19TSequentialExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::TSequentialExecutor""* %9); %thread = call i32 @_ZNK4ROOT15TThreadExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::TThreadExecutor""* %13); %process = call i32 @_ZNK4ROOT16TProcessExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::TProcessExecutor""* %17); }. ; Function Attrs: noinline nounwind uwtable; define linkonce_odr i32 @_ZNK4ROOT19TSequentialExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::TSequentialExecutor""*) #1 comdat align 2 {; ; ...; }. declare i32 @_ZNK4ROOT15TThreadExecutor11GetPoolSizeEv(%""class.ROOT::TThreadExecutor""*) #2; ```. So the dict contains the definition of `Executor::GetPoolSize()`, which is not `inline`, and references `TThreadExecutor::GetPoolSize()` defined in `libImt.so`, but obviously not in the dict. This symbol remains unresolved during JIT, leading to the error message we're seeing. Notice that `TSequentialExecutor::GetPoolSize()` is `linkonce_odr` due to being `inline`. When adding the `inline` keyword to `TExecutor::GetPoolSize()` (thanks Philippe for the less intrusive proposal), all these functions disappear from the loaded `llvm::Module` because unused `linkonce_odr` are dropped (recursively) before passing to JIT. So in essence I think this is not about symbols not being exported or inlined by the compiler, but what we need is the semantics of `inline` that the function can be dropped from the `llvm::Module`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7033#issuecomment-760022478:261,load,loaded,261,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7033#issuecomment-760022478,2,['load'],['loaded']

Performance,"Hi @dcervenkov , I believe you are counting the time spent just-in-time compiling (""jitting"") the cuts as if it was part of the event loop: RDataFrame, when strings are used as filters or defines, has a non-negligible start-up time because it's actually compiling those strings into C++ code. With ROOT master branch (and in v6.24, coming soon), you can retrieve the jitting time and the event loop time separately by adding the following line at the beginning of `main`:. ```cpp; auto verbosity = ROOT::Experimental::RLogScopedVerbosity(ROOT::Detail::RDF::RDFLogChannel(), ROOT::Experimental::ELogLevel.kInfo);; ```. Here is a version without jitting that should run faster than the python version (make sure to add `-O2` to the compilation flags though -- C++ code needs those sweet compiler optimizations):. ```cpp; #include <iostream>; #include <vector>. #include ""ROOT/RDataFrame.hxx"". int which_time_bin(const double time) {; const double bin_edges[] = {0, 0.00025 * 1, 0.00025 * 2,; 0.00025 * 3, 0.00025 * 4, 0.00025 * 5,; 0.00025 * 6, 0.00025 * 7, 0.00025 * 8};; int bin = -1;; for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {; if (time < bin_edges[i]); return bin;; bin++;; }; return bin;; }. int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {; ROOT::RDataFrame df_raw(""DalitzEventList"", argv[1]);; auto df = df_raw.Define(""time_bin"", which_time_bin, {""D_decayTime""});. const int time_bins = 8;; ROOT::RDF::RResultPtr<ULong64_t> counts[time_bins];; for (int time_bin = 0; time_bin < time_bins; time_bin++) {; counts[time_bin] = df.Filter([=](int tb) { return tb == time_bin; }, {""time_bin""}).Count();; }. for (int time_bin = 0; time_bin < time_bins; time_bin++) {; std::cout << *counts[time_bin] << std::endl;; }. return 0;; }; ```.

So we are more concerned about the best fit values of the variables in the workspace than the value of the NLL itself.

Performance,"Hi @hageboeck and @manolismih, thanks for you comments! Sorry for the late answer, it took me some time to come up with a better solution. Making the `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` aware of the batchmode is the biggest challenge in this PR, as you have noticed.; Like Stephan suggested, I have tried no to pass as much information as possible in the constructors to hopefully avoid some of the new member variables I introduced here. In part I have succeeded, because now the cache optimization will now always be skipped in the construction in batch mode is enabled. So I don't need a `_originallyCacheOptimized` flag to remember if the optimization has to be reverted after the construction which was not the nicest hack anyway. Still, I could not do without a new `_batchMode` flag in `RooAbsTestStatistic` because the cache optimization can also happen after the construction via `RooAbsTestStatistic::constOptimizeTestStatistic`. Adding a batch mode flag to the constructor also required me to change all the constructor signatures of `RooAbsTestStatistic` and derived classes. I took that opportunity to revisit how the configuration parameters are passed such that if the future it will be much easier to add a new parameter.

The limit is in the dCache storage system (xrootd.grid.surfsara.nl), not on the client side. This limit is there for a reason: it prevents the storage pools from being overloaded with transfers and crashing. When hadd tries to open all files at once, it tries to read more files concurrently than the limit per dCache storage pool allows. The first files are served, but the rest of the transfers are queued. This means, that they remain open but zero bytes are served, until some of the other transfers finish. But hadd never finishes those because it insists on reading from all files at the same time. So it gets stuck into a deadlock situation. If hadd would detect this situation (I'm getting data for some files but zero bytes for other files), it would make sense to stop reading all files concurrently, but instead continue reading from all files that it can, close those files, and then receive data for the other files.

Performance,"Hi Enrico, thank you very much for taking a look. > 1. I guess the behavior of TTaskGroup should mimic what TThreadExecutor does, e.g. it should use the task arena if it exists, and it should construct one if it doesn't. What's the rationale for doing things independently of ROOT's task arena? Does this mean users might see more cores used than they expect in some cases?. I believe this change only removes an unnecessary restriction on when `TTaskGroup` can be used (i.e. after looking through the implementation, I don't think having IMT globally enabled is a precondition for the use of `TTaskGroup` and test benchmarks using this implementation seem to perform the same). > 2.

Performance,"Hi Vassil,. > We cannot control what's in the static init of user libraries. They can; use interpreter services. This approach used to work, why locking is; necessary? Aren't we 'just' reading?. Other threads could be trying to write the symbol tables at the same time,; so we still need to lock them for reading. In your case your lookup enters a generator (HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator),; so it will end up writing as well as reading. :). The right thing to do here is to refactor HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator; to do its work in two steps:; Step 1: Identify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested; symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you; should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ (; ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ].

I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock; (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like; this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so""; provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and; resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""...; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers a lookup in; the JIT for ""f"".; 2.2.1.

However, some headers in module `ROOTDataFrame` includes `TSeq.hxx` (https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RLazyDSImpl.hxx#L16), so we found a Decl that already been instantiated. At last, Clang will try to update the previous declaration and merge the definition. But because we're still instantiating it and it's incomplete so they're not matched.

I guess the behavior of `TTaskGroup` should mimic what `TThreadExecutor` does, e.g. it should use the task arena if it exists, and it should construct one if it doesn't. What's the rationale for doing things independently of ROOT's task arena? Does this mean users might see more cores used than they expect in some cases?; 2. Are you ok with silently do nothing if R__IMT is undefined? Would it be better to print a warning?; 3. Can we also have a way to disable RNTuple's multi-threading even if implicit MT is enabled, like TTree has?. P.S.; this stuff is always tricky to reason about for me, sorry if i'm missing obvious stuff. the rationale behind my question is that we should not have N different multi-threading behaviors for N components (because then we can't reason about how these components interact with each other because there are too many possibilities), we should not surprisingly use more cores than users might expect (and we should play well with the TBB settings of frameworks such as CMSSW, but it's not clear to me how we do that now, actually)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8334#issuecomment-854489805:507,multi-thread,multi-threading,507,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8334#issuecomment-854489805,4,['multi-thread'],['multi-threading']

Okay, the problem with the `RooRealSumPdf` hinted me that this new optimization was part of the problem (look for ""binned likelihood fit optimization"").; https://root.cern/doc/v628/release-notes.html. This optimization was used inside ATLAS for a long time to great success (speedups), so I was enabling it by default. However, it seems to be problematic here, maybe it doesn't work with the RooBarlowBeestonLL. You should for now disable it when the demo is compiled with ROOT 6.28. So the line with `MakeModelAndMeasurementFast` in `histfact_demo.cpp` would become:; ```C++; #if ROOT_VERSION_CODE < ROOT_VERSION(6,28,00); auto ws = RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(meas);; #else; // Disable the binned fit optimization that was enabled by default in ROOT 6.28.; // This optimization skips the normalization of the RooRealSumPdf, because; // the unnormalized bin contents already represent the yields that can be; // used by the RooNLLVar to sum the Poisson terms.

Performance,"Hi,; I double-checked the behavior of `TTree::Draw` and `TTreeReader` when reading ""misaligned"" friends in a number of situations: as `TTrees`/`TChains`, friends longer/shorter than the main tree, friends with/without a `TTreeIndex`. With the path at https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7131, which avoids an infinite loop with `TTreeReader` + indexed friend tree, `TTreeReader` and `TTree::Draw` behave the same in all cases except the one reported here. This means e.g. that switching from using a `TTree` to using a `TChain` to read the same data can change the number of entries `TTreeReader` reads in case of a friend that's larger than the main `TTree`. The problematic logic is that of `TTree::LoadTree(entry)`, which does not return an error if `entry` is larger than the number of entries in the main tree as long as the friend tree has enough entries (again note that `TChain` behaves differently, ending the event loop as soon as the main tree entries are over, and `TTree/TChain::Draw` also behaves like that).

Performance,"Hi,; yes following the linked example of the VavilovAccuratePdf is fine. It is true you have made a class, but only with static functions. Like this is not needed to be a class, can be simple function in a namespace. The advantage of having as a class is that one can cache some information as class data members. . Then test of the Vavilov is also a good example, however it is better to use the google test framework, resulting in a much simpler test to write. You need just to use the macro defined by test to compare the function value with the reference one. ; You have many examples in ROOT for gtest, for example in `hist/hist/test` directory like `test_TH1.cxx` or `test_TFormula.cxx`, `test_TF123_Moments.cxx`.

Performance,"I actually remember trying `Evaluate` but it crashed. Didn't look into too many details as to why; it does have a couple of fewer ""protection pieces"" (such as the mutex lock) than does `Calc()`, so that may be the reason. But even then, I gave up on all that when I realized that Python readily outperforms. I mean, talk about optimization, even for your integer case and compare these two macro's:. ```; int noleak() {; int result = 0;; for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {; result += (int)TPython::Eval(""1+1"");; }; return result;; }; ```; and; ```; int leak() {; int result = 0;; for (int i = 0; i < 10000; ++i) {; result += (int)gInterpreter->Calc(""1+1"");; }; return result;; }; ```; Please note the constant: the `TPython::Eval()` is called _100x more_ than `TInterpreter::Calc()` and it is _still 4x faster_ on my box. So, my conclusion is that if you are in Cling and need to evaluate a run-time constructed expression represented in string-form, then the optimizily thing to do, is to call into Python ... (and if in a loop, then even if Python uses cppyy in turn, which uses Cling again, it will still outperform). And, of course, bonus points for not leaking ... There is one case where `cppyy` still fails: if the `operator+` in the expression above is a global `friend` (with the operands instances of some class), as so far, I've been unable to locate that method. So, I do still care, but my main problem is the leak on failed lookups, as those are very common. And I don't believe it is just the allocator, which as you tell it would re-use the memory, but I'll see first whether I can construct a pure Cling-only reproducer then. Aside, if/when the lookup helper is inverted (i.e. being able to tell what some _is_ rather than what it _isn't_), many of the failed lookups will simply go away.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7201#issuecomment-806058368:327,optimiz,optimization,327,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7201#issuecomment-806058368,4,['optimiz'],"['optimization', 'optimizily']"

Performance,"I agree that it is an unfortunate circumstance to have the test not passing. However, I still urge you to consider the effect on debugability removing strict tests will have. I have wasted a lot of time trying to track down a subtle bug due to loose tests which left me unable to determine where the bug came from. Conversely, setting tests strictly and tracing discrepancies, I found a different bug in the Kahan sum: #11940. Unit tests especially should be as strict as possible. In absence of unit tests (which unfortunately is the case for the parts of RooFit I worked on), strict ""integration"" tests like these are the closest I could get. Note also that it was simply part of my original assignment: to ensure users can trust the new parallelized methods, I built them to be bit-wise exactly equal to the old methods. So, I know from experience how tedious it is to trace down these bit-wise differences to their actual concrete source, but also think that because we are dealing with scientific software, precision, robustness, reliability and interpretability (of components and hence the whole) are important. Of course, performance is an important factor too, but it's just one of the aspects. We want the end-results of experiments to be accurate and explainable, right? I personally at least don't like when I have to sell a ""because of floating point errors"", because I've been bitten by them a few times now. Now, I'm also well aware that the project only has a given amount of resources and I myself am currently more or less out of resources (I can spend only my free time), so my vote probably doesn't count strongly :) If I could be of more practical help in this, I would definitely be happy to, but I also don't have a non-x86 machine, so it's not feasible for me to do much right now.

Performance,"I am a little concerned about the basic idea. If I understood correctly, there is a (unique) global registry where the histogram are identified based on their 'full path name' (beside the fact that GetNameForRanges seems both brittle and currently seems on first reading 'wrong'/'not-as-intended'). I see two major problems, one is that the 'full path name' may never be really unique i.e. it might be impossible to avoid synonyms that are semantically distincts ... a good example is two free standings (not attached to any directory) histograms that happens to have the same name in two distinct and independent part of the code (e.g. two CMSSW modules). The other major problem is that it unnecessary tie (via that global mutex) all the 'parallel' histogram, this means that the overall scalability is inherently decreased. Rather than a completely global state, wouldn't it make sense to have a wrapper object (for example TThreadedObject) be the holder of the lock and list for a single set of related histogram.; This would both reduce contention and guarantees that the histograms are really related. A 3rd significant problem (but fixeable) is that the operation covered by the ReadWrite lock are not atomic (and/or trivial) and for the look of it could plausibly indirectly request the ROOT global lock and thus can lead to deadlocks (from some other code that hold the ROOT global locks and request the Write part of the ReadWrite lock). A 4th deficiency is that once activated for one histogram it *seems* to apply to all histogram. i.e. as far as can tell if you one parallel histograms and 10,000 single-thread histograms, filling the single-thread histogram still has to go through the multi-thread registration/mechanism. And that remind me, that another challenge for the 'unique registry' solution is to understand its scalability where reaching 10 to 100 thousands histograms.

Performance,"I had a look ant it seems very nice. About the discrepancy between `REntry::Get` and `RNTupleModel::MakeField`, one may argue that `MakeField` might return a raw pointer too as the memory of the field is owned by the model. OTOH, while it's kind of easy to keep track of the lifetime of an `REntry` (I get it, I use it, I drop it), it seems more difficult to keep track of `RNTupleModel` lifetime, which is bound to the lifetime of `RNTupleWriter`.; Using raw pointers from `MakeField` is fine if we assume that the writer of the code only accesses the fields within the scope of `RNTupleWriter` (but the fields are accessible before the writer is created... more confusing). My personal opinion is that the `CreateEntry` way is the best option for the single thread case too:; - I define a model; - create a writer based on the model; - get the *buffer* (`REntry`) to write to (one per thread, for example, even if I have only one thread); - commit the *buffer* to the writer. In this way I own the `REntry`, but it has a layout in memory that is directly understood by the serialization process without the need of extra copies. We can also think of a way of constructing the writer from an *inlined* model, without the need for repeated calls to `MakeField`. Something like:; ```cpp; auto ntuple = RNTupleWriter::Recreate({; Field<std::uint32_t>(""id""),; Field<std::vector<float>>(""vpx""),; Field<std::vector<float>>(""vpy""),; Field<std::vector<float>>(""vpz""); }, ""NTuple"", kNTupleFileName);. auto entry = ntuple->CreateEntry();; // cache the pointer for faster access in single thread,; // but I could use TLS (or a framework equivalent) for multithreading; auto& vpx = *entry->Get<std::vector<float>>(""vpx"");; for(auto& event: all_events) {; vpx.clear();; vpx.push_back(42.);; ntuple->Fill(entry); // I would prefer ntuple->Write(entry) but it's a matter of taste; }; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8688#issuecomment-883396155:1533,cache,cache,1533,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8688#issuecomment-883396155,2,['cache'],['cache']

Performance,"I have a general comment about adding this extra level of parallelism to the branch reading. While it might indeed help in cases where there is only one top-level branch that is split in sub-branches, it could also bring ""too much"" parallelism in some other cases. The performance of the top-level branch parallelism heavily depends on the granularity of the branches. For small branches, the creation of a task does not really pay off. I fear this problem might be exacerbated if we also operate in sub-branches. Moreover, as we offer it now, we won't have any way for the user to select how deep in parallelisation terms they want to go, meaning every time we run GetEntry with IMT on all the parallelism levels will be activated. On the other hand, another thing that hindered performance in the top-level branch parallelism was synchronization. Now there is one synchronization point per entry, which can be problematic if there is load unbalance (that is why we sorted the branches by time). Adding a second level of parallelism means we will have one more synchronization point per top-level branch and we don't know how this can impact performance.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1468#issuecomment-352709176:269,perform,performance,269,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1468#issuecomment-352709176,4,"['load', 'perform']","['load', 'performance']"

Performance,"I have in the mean time found the root cause why my patch fails:; - It is due to copy relocations of <iostream> symbols from libstdc++; - Crashes happen whenever cling wants to output text via cout / cerr / etc.; - The problem is that there are 2 instances of cout / cerr: The first created by the executable itself through copy relocation, when the executable prints something via cout. The second created by libCling loaded with RTLD_DEEPBIND. (By design, RTLD_DEEPBIND links to libstdc++ first before checking the global namespace, so it does not see the copy-relocated symbol.). The problem can be avoided if executables are compiled with -fPIC as well.; I just tried locally to compile the failing ROOT ctests with -fPIC and this fixed the segmentation faults.; The question is whether this is a proper solution, since it would require to compile all executables with -fPIC.

Performance,"I replied via email, but GitHub does not seem to have picked it up, so posting here for good measure:. > We cannot control what's in the static init of user libraries. They can use interpreter services. This approach used to work, why locking is necessary? Aren't we 'just' reading?. Other threads could be trying to write the symbol tables at the same time, so we still need to lock them for reading. In your case your lookup enters a generator (HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator), so it will end up writing as well as reading. :). The right thing to do here is to refactor HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator to do its work in two steps:; Step 1: Identify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ ( ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a circular reference). I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so"" provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""... ; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1104564382:676,load,loaded,676,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1104564382,2,['load'],"['load', 'loaded']"

Performance,"I still had one trick up my sleeve: I dumped the generated IR from the ""bad"" and the ""good"" compiler to see which part of the code is actually modified.

The reasoning is that `RooAddPdf::checkObservables` calls a member function on `pdf`, so it being `nullptr` is UB and can be optimized out, and dereferences `coef`, which is also UB on a `nullptr` (although it works because `RooAbsArg::observableOverlaps` takes a reference, ie no pointer dereference actually takes place). If I remove the `return nullptr` statically in the code like; ```diff; diff --git a/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h b/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h; index c5a49bd1b6..bb4afbd12d 100644; --- a/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h; +++ b/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgList.h; @@ -109,9 +109,6 @@ public:; /// Return object at given index, or nullptr if index is out of range; inline RooAbsArg* at(Int_t idx) const {. - if (idx >= static_cast<Int_t>(_list.size())); - return nullptr;; -; return _list[idx];; }. ```; I see the same crash happening with GCC. What I see with a debugger is that `_pdfList` has size 2 while `_coefList` has size 1, so the second iteration of the loop passes `nullptr` for `coef`. This is ""filtered out"" later in `RooAbsArg::dependsOn` where `ignoreArg` is also `nullptr` and things magically work. So, @guitargeek, there are a number of possibilities:; 1. Modify the loop to only run until `std::min(_pdfList.size(), _coefList.size()`.; 2. Add explicit `nullptr` checks for `pdf` and `coef` before calling `observableOverlaps` so the compiler cannot optimize them out",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9547#issuecomment-1011927535:352,optimiz,optimizes,352,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9547#issuecomment-1011927535,2,['optimiz'],"['optimized', 'optimizes']"

We see this for example when during an RDF distributed execution HTCondor workers (""pilot processes"") are spawned and subsequent tasks that need to compile macros/code cells are executed by them. However, if I understand correctly, we could avoid completely all code interpretation (which can be thread unsafe and memory consuming) after the first compilation of the macro/code cell. This could be achieved if we had in place a thread safe mechanism to recognise the code to be compiled, and, if already compiled within the same process, not compiled again, e.g. some hashing, instead of the current time stamp check (not like ccache, but somehow being inspired by it). Then a worker would behave as follows:; - first task: compile macro and load library; - second task: hash macro code, and, if already compiled, no-op; - ...; - n-th task: hash macro code, and, if already compiled, no-op; This would have the advantage of being manageable from the thread-safety point of view and consume just the memory necessary to interpret the macro once.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13655#issuecomment-1762173995:932,load,load,932,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13655#issuecomment-1762173995,1,['load'],['load']

What the failing test does is: 1. assign task priorities, 2. run the tasks and record the order in which they are executed, 3. check the received order against the suggested one via the priorities. The problem is that due to random OS process scheduling delays, the received order is never 100% predictable. The only thing that is guaranteed is that if it has multiple tasks in the queue at one time that it will execute the one with highest priority first.

Performance,"In either the original test (via `TClingClassInfo`) or the latest example `TClass::GetClass(""B<NS::A<int>>"")`, the code triggers attempts to instantiate a template which fails (due to the type being only forward declared).

Technically, we don't know yet whether it is a problem with the transaction unloader or the the transaction decl capture (or possibly even on the failure detection). What we do know is that the desired behavior [in last example](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13815#issuecomment-1759250811) is that after the execution of `TClass::GetClass(""B<NS::A<int>>"")` (i.e at the end of line 2), `Cling` should NOT be holding an instantiation of the trait (not sure which)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13815#issuecomment-1766925765:279,load,loaded,279,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13815#issuecomment-1766925765,1,['load'],['loaded']

Performance,"In regards to ROOT builds with specific architectures: I believe that the users explicitly setting ""-march=avx"" or downloading a binary tagged as ""avx"" would assume that the code they are running is always avx. So it might surprise them negatively that the default runtime option I introduced is ""find the most optimal computation library"". On the other hand, it would also be a negative surprise if users get throttled down if their hardware supports a faster library than what they specified. The solution discussed in the Monday meeting was issuing a warning for that possible mismatch in CMake, in case the users have specified themselves a specific architecture. BUT, if we provide binaries, it's just us that will get the warning, so it's completely useless.

Each thread needs a local copy of the histogram to fill. At least with ROOT 6 histograms there is no way around that that does not involve a loss in performance.

Performance,"My 2 cents:. 1. You have to expand the glob to an actual list of files and grab e.g. the first file in the list. One (not elegant) way to do it is to go through `TChain::Add`. Just performing the glob expansion with TChain does not require that there are TTrees in the file:; ```; /tmp touch foo.root; /tmp touch bar.root; /tmp root -l; root [0] TChain c;; root [1] c.Add(""*.root""); (int) 2; root [2] c.GetListOfFiles()->GetEntries(); (int) 2; root [3] c.GetListOfFiles()->At(0)->GetName(); (const char *) """"; root [4] c.GetListOfFiles()->At(0)->GetTitle(); (const char *) ""/tmp/bar.root""; root [5] c.GetListOfFiles()->At(1)->GetTitle(); (const char *) ""/tmp/foo.root""; ```. 2. The quick fix is to assume TTree if the file does not exist.

Performance,"My bad for not managing to get to this in time. I think most of the logic would go in `GetColumnReader`, in `ColumnReaderUtils`: it would have to create a `TreeColumnReader` if the column is present in the tree and pick the reader for the default value instead. The main complication is dealing with chains in which _some_ trees contain the column and some do not.; The most direct way to do it is leveraging TChain's callback mechanism to switch column readers as needed, but a) TChain's callback mechanism is a mess and b) even if unused TTreeReaderValues for missing branches might emit warnings (unless they are completely destroyed maybe?).; An more roundabout way to do the same would be to change single-thread RDataFrame so that it runs a separate event loop for each sub-tree and never uses a TChain --> you automatically get a call to `GetColumnReader` that can re-evaluate whether the branch or the default value should be used at the start of every new event loop. Finally, you can implement the default as a `Define` that always returns the same number (and in first approximation that's probably the easiest). A slightly nicer underlying implementation would involve a `ConstReader` that explicitly stores a constant value and always returns that same value, but the advantage is unclear -- a good optimizing compiler would elide the call to the lambda that always returns the same number anyways.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8704#issuecomment-1911020478:1312,optimiz,optimizing,1312,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8704#issuecomment-1911020478,1,['optimiz'],['optimizing']

I have to admit that I personally do not get this immediately and I have to stop half a second to think about the meaning of the function name.; * `GenerateValueOn` also doesn't work because the value is being generated by the other instance, not on.; * `GenerateValueFrom` personally has a similar meaning to `GenerateValueBy` and is easier to get intuitively.; * The `GenerateValueFrom` naming works for `Generate` but not for `Append`. I.e. I don't like `AppendFrom` since that sounds like we are appending some value *from* the other instance *into* this one; * To me it looks like all these functions are performing a call of the same function name on another instance.

Performance,"My understanding is that one possible optimization is related to auto-loading of namespaces. At the moment, we load all modules, which can be a problem for ""widespread"" namespaces such as `ROOT::Experimental`. However, we need this for `ROOT::RDF` and so on which live in libraries / modules that are not eagerly loaded. FWIW yesterday I thought about this, and it seems to me that once we know that something is a namespace that we've already seen somewhere, we don't actually need to do anything - contained classes will be loaded on demand from the modules that actually contain them. My idea was to add a check to `TClingCallbacks::LookupObject(const DeclContext* DC, DeclarationName Name)` and if `Name` already resolves to a known namespace, just `return false`. That's a bit tricky though because if we do a name lookup from there, it will recursively call Cling again. We might be able to cut this loop with a boolean flag that we set just before doing the lookup, but I stopped my experiments here.

Performance,"OK thanks. I believe that ""there is no other way to get reliable results"" is a bit of an exaggeration - many numerical libraries and programs do not turn fp exceptions on. IEEE 754 allows them to survive just fine the cases you are hunting down, because (as you certainly know) IEEE 754 brings defined behavior to ""degenerate"" (not in the IEEE 754 sense) cases. As a matter of fact, I believe you have just proven to yourself that ""there is no other way to get reliable results"" is also incorrect, as the optimizer might change fp operations. Yes, GCC tries to keep them ""fp-safe"" but that might change in any of the upcoming versions, just like it did for instance for clang, the Intel compiler, and - if I remember correctly - MSVC. Our approach is not to rely on fp exceptions but on coverage in regression tests. That has limited reach (as would fp exceptions) but it allows us to detect when results change in a visible, ""unreliable"" way.

Performance,"Ok yes, this is exactly the same underlying issue as ROOT-9487 mentioned above, but for single-thread runs this time, so the workaround mentioned in ROOT-9487 does not work (and indeed adding `ROOT.EnableImplicitMT()` at the top of the repro gets rid of the warnings). The issue: `Snapshot` adds the output tree as a clone of the input chain, because the output tree needs to be informed when the addresses of the input branches change (as it happens when the chain switches from one tree to the next). Now, when performing the address updates, the input chain might complain _once per active branch_ if it does not find a corresponding branch in the output tree. I don't know how to solve this elegantly. The only idea I have is an ad-hoc temporary silencing of these warnings at the point at which an input chain in RDF switches files. @pcanal might have a better proposal.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7727#issuecomment-817874049:513,perform,performing,513,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7727#issuecomment-817874049,1,['perform'],['performing']

For 100M entries per thread into 10 branches, the only worse performance I can find is with 64 threads (on `ntpl-perf01`):; ```; ttreeTBufferMergerBranchesVariableRate.00-master.100000000.10.t64.log: Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 5:08.58; ttreeTBufferMergerBranchesVariableRate.01-limit.100000000.10.t64.log: Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 5:12.00; ttreeTBufferMergerBranchesVariableRate.02-no-queue.100000000.10.t64.log: Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 5:16.36; ```.

Performance,"On the jenkins build node the error appears likely because of '-Dsoversion=""On""' and the following. One test that fails is 'runload.C' in roottest/root/treeformula/sync. There we have (essentially):; ```; {; gROOT->ProcessLine("".L loadcode.C+"");; ...; TTree *t; _file0->GetObject(""t"",t);; }; ```; The use of TTree means that before executing the script libTree is laoded.; During the execution of CompileMacro, the depend library are loaded (see for example the collection line [3363](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/f32d06e70ce357b53050a25eecd5186859021e30/core/base/src/TSystem.cxx#L3363) .; And in this case the result is:; ```; loadcode_C.so libTree.6.21.01.so libTree.so; ```; which coupled with the ***new*** feature that gSystem->Load first dlclose the library then reopen it means that libTree is dlclose 2 or 3 times (one for both the versioned and unversioned version). This behavior is a **very significant** departure from the existing behavior (where, because the libraries were added to the link line, the library were never reloaded). Reloading arbitrary depend library is never a good idea since they (are likely to) include static object that may do things that are **essential** to do only once (initialization, connection to db). Technically CompileMacro could (as it does elsewhere) first check if the library is loaded. But still several questions:. 1) Why is libTree listed twice in the list of depend library?. 2) When should gSystem->Load automatically reload a library, if ever?. @Axel-Naumann @vgvassilev opinions?. PS. Even-though the set of test would be fixed by updating gSystem->Load and/or CompileMacro, the PR is still likely necessary for the case where CompileMacro generates a pcm (and thus need to support reload) or the case where the user explicitly unload a library.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5420#issuecomment-618042721:231,load,loadcode,231,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5420#issuecomment-618042721,6,"['Load', 'load']","['Load', 'loadcode', 'loaded']"

Performance,"Performance-wise and functionality-wise would still work if for the duration of the trials, the state needed to do the matching is kept alive. That was mostly the idea with the code above, but is not how I would solve it today. So, to your points:. No, it does not need to be instantiated first. For example, if I know that a _potential_ match has a signature of `T*`, then I'm not going to ask it to match `T&`, so even before instantiation, the lookup has useful information. Right now, CPyCppyy loops over each, so will eventually match if all types are by-pointer or all are by reference, but that fails combinations. Another good case is knowing which arguments are based on template parameters and which are not, so that the non-template ones need not be varied. No, on the Python side it is fair game to provide the template arguments, and thus non-ADL happens, too. E.g. all int types are equivalent as far as Python is concerned, and although CPyCppyy will increase the template int argument if it has an argument value larger than will fit, it is not uncommon for Python users to simply fill in `int64_t` or whatever. In fact, as-is, if the prototype lookup, ie. argument dependent, fails, CPyCppyy will assume that we're dealing with the common case where all argument types are template parameters. (It's a human thing to make that order consistent, which is why it works quite often, but it is not a language requirement/guarantee.) It then asks for the full name in a non-ADL manner. ROOT/meta (lookupHelper, I think) does not even support friends, so no worries there. Whether you think it is ""eeew"" or not is irrelevant. That's highly a technical term. What is relevant is that just before the lookupHelper does a `BestViableFunction()` it has a `OverloadCandidateSet` and I can do a much better job finding my own match than can do Sema, b/c the rules to apply aren't exactly the C++ ones (the only ones that Sema knows). Unfortunately, I can't just return the set, as it's deep in th",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-696817778:0,Perform,Performance-wise,0,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6393#issuecomment-696817778,1,['Perform'],['Performance-wise']

Performance,"Quoting @pcanal:. > I am a bit lost ... Do we understand the reason for the thread unsafety? What data is there a race condition on? [Note for example that gPad is thread-local and in-itself not a cause for problem (unless several threads have their gPad pointing to the same pad). > One thing that would be helpful to understand the scope is the 2 stack traces of the 2 threads accessing the same pointer. Since you @andriish also found a workaround for your problem, it would be better to only change the code in ROOT once we understand exactly what the problem on the ROOT side is and how it is solved by this change (or another change). Therefore I'll close this PR here, but please feel free to engage with us again either here on GitHub or on the ROOT forum if you have practical problems again!

This is the issue we had before, the CI bot uses an order version of clang-format which produces this weird formatting based on the same style file.

Performance,"Regarding the titular issue, I have been thinking about it for a bit and I don't think we can do much better than what @pieterdavid already implemented. Solutions considered:. 1. Implicitly converting `TClonesArrays` to `RVecs` would be a) backward-incompatible and b) a silent perf degradation, as it requires a copy. Moreover, if we did this I don't see a migration path that doesn't require that users revise all their TClonesArrays-related logic; 2. Adding a `TClonesArrays2RVec` helper function: it would require a copy (or it would have to return a clunky `RVec<T*>`). It is also trivial to implement for users that need it and don't mind the downsides.; 3. Adding a RDF toggle to tweak ""read TClonesArrays as RVecs"" or not: requires adding a bunch of extra logic to the column-reading mechanism for a feature that might end up being mostly unused (modern data models don't use TClonesArrays), and it would require the extra copy (i.e. silent performance degradation). The best seems to be 3, but feature toggles complicate internals and are typically not easy to discover (might end up mostly unused).

As a consequence, RDefine had to keep track; of whether InitSlot was already called on it for a given task and a; given slot. We can avoid the multiple InitSlot calls on the same objects and the; book-keeping of whether the call already happened or not by having; RLoopManager call InitSlot on every defined column once per task and per; slot. To this end, we need to register RDefine objects with the; RLoopManager when they are created and deregister them when they are; destroyed. tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RAction.hxx | 14 +++++++-------; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RBookedDefines.hxx | 5 +++++; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RDefine.hxx | 20 ++++++--------------; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RDefineBase.hxx | 1 -; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RFilter.hxx | 14 ++++++--------; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RInterface.hxx | 8 +++++---; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RJittedDefine.hxx | 1 +; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RLoopManager.hxx | 4 ++++; tree/dataframe/src/RDFBookedDefines.cxx | 5 +++++; tree/dataframe/src/RDefineBase.cxx | 10 ++++------; tree/dataframe/src/RJittedDefine.cxx | 6 ++++++; tree/dataframe/src/RLoopManager.cxx | 15 +++++++++++++++; 12 files changed, 64 insertions(+), 39 deletions(-); ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10007#issuecomment-1057004565:83,Cache,Cache,83,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10007#issuecomment-1057004565,1,['Cache'],['Cache']

Performance,"Several fixes are up in the PR, however there is something strange about `std::variant<std::optional<int>>`. On macOS, this type has a size of 16 (and not 12 as one would expect, with 8 bytes for the int + bool struct of the optional plus 4 bytes for the index member). Moreover, the additional 4 bytes come from padding at the beginning of the variant type. Clang's `dump-record-layouts` gives the following, where I cannot explain why the `__impl` member starts at an offset of 4. Could it be related to empty base class optimization, or in this case the lack thereof due to multiple inheritance? But in this case, why is the padding missing for `std::variant<X>`, with `struct X {int i; bool b;};`?. ```; *** Dumping AST Record Layout; 0 | class std::variant<class std::optional<int> >; 0 | struct std::__sfinae_ctor_base<true, true> (base) (empty); 0 | struct std::__sfinae_assign_base<true, true> (base) (empty); 4 | class std::__variant_detail::__impl<class std::optional<int> > __impl; 4 | class std::__variant_detail::__copy_assignment<struct std::__variant_detail::__traits<class std::optional<int> >, std::__variant_detail::_Trait::_TriviallyAvailable> (base); 4 | class std::__variant_detail::__move_assignment<struct std::__variant_detail::__traits<class std::optional<int> >, std::__variant_detail::_Trait::_TriviallyAvailable> (base); 4 | class std::__variant_detail::__assignment<struct std::__variant_detail::__traits<class std::optional<int> > > (base); 4 | class std::__variant_detail::__copy_constructor<struct std::__variant_detail::__traits<class std::optional<int> >, std::__variant_detail::_Trait::_TriviallyAvailable> (base); 4 | class std::__variant_detail::__move_constructor<struct std::__variant_detail::__traits<class std::optional<int> >, std::__variant_detail::_Trait::_TriviallyAvailable> (base); 4 | class std::__variant_detail::__ctor<struct std::__variant_detail::__traits<class std::optional<int> > > (base); 4 | class std::__variant_detail::__dtor<struct std::__va",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15534#issuecomment-2127329395:523,optimiz,optimization,523,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15534#issuecomment-2127329395,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

In that case, the implementation will switch back to non-modules. Short answer, yes we can provide such API, however, that would not be 100% reliable. A reliable API should work on per-library basis.

This is because the lock that we are removing in the constructor was turning many other lock regions into a no-op, since the lock was already taken. However, after the change, they become visible, with a big effect on performance. You can see in the screenshot that the number of waits on `TList::MakeIterator`, for example, jumps from 62 to 3302, and all that locking/unlocking has a cost...

Performance,"T'` it will fail. That's what I mean when I say that by relying on `PYTHONPATH` only one version will work. > we need to continue to support using multiple ROOT versions with python, also outside conda. That is always possible, but it requires setup scripts. I'm usually talking here about the situation in which you do `yum install root`, and it should work out of the box, without any extra setup. Same for other distributions. This is already the case in Fedora, but they have to go through hoops to make it work, like using alternatives for `libPyROOT.so` in `/etc/alternatives`. That's what I'd like to address. > we must not run setup.py as part of a ROOT installation. This makes it much harder to do the right thing during installation in order for things to work properly. PyROOT is a python package afterall, so what's the problem in using Python's native methods of installation as part of `make install`?. > It would be great if import ROOT can auto-detect which libPython (python2 or python3) to load; that would take care of the multi-python case after source thisroot.sh. At the moment, `libPyROOT.so` can only work with either Python 2.x or 3.x, not both. We need to change compile-time checks into runtime checks to make the same library work with both Python 2.x and 3.x (there are many `#ifdef`s on the Python version, for example). Finally, `thisroot.sh` is totally evil and should be deprecated. It messes up the environment when sourcing it, by potentially removing things from the path that should not be removed. It also assumes things about how ROOT was installed, so if ROOT's libraries are not in `$ROOTSYS/lib` (e.g., if they are in `$ROOTSYS/lib64`, or `$ROOTSYS/root/lib` with `gnuinstall=ON`) the script won't work. It also uses a colon for separator in `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, which is separated by semicolons, among other problems. My advice to people is to just stop using the script. Anyway, this is all a digression from this PR.

Performance,"TLDR: `TTree* TMVA::DataSet::GetTree` is missing a call to `tree->ResetBranchAddresses()` at the end. The interesting bit is that `TBufferFile::ReadInt` is being used even-though all the variables in the example (and indeed all their corresponding branches) are floats. So the issue is that the address of the Int branch:; ```; *Br 0 :classID : classID/I *; ```; is still set to an address that uses to be on the stack (according to valgrind). How can it be possible, you may ask. Well ... looking at the result of `fOutputFile->ls("""")` we notice:; ```; ....; OBJ: TTree TestTree TestTree : 0 at: 0x5555555eae70; ```; **even before** the call to `fOutputFile.Get(""dataset/TestTree"");`. This means that at point the `TTree` is already in memory (and already setup) and this prior loading is the likely place of the setting of the address to a local variable. It turns out that the `TTree` is created in `TTree* TMVA::DataSet::GetTree` at `DataSet.cxx:628` and later we have:; ```; UInt_t cls;; ...; tree->Branch( ""classID"", &cls, ""classID/I"" );; ...; return tree;; }; ```; At which point the `tree` is returns pointing to a bunch of now invalid memory location.; Using:; ```; tree->ResetBranchAddresses();; return tree;; }; ```; solves the problem.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10010#issuecomment-2080153300:779,load,loading,779,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10010#issuecomment-2080153300,1,['load'],['loading']

Performance,"Thank you for reporting this difference. The reason is that new PyROOT has split in a few libraries, when it used to be only one in the old PyROOT. In this case, the deserialization causes the loading and initialization of `libROOTPythonizations`, but `libcppyy` has not been loaded yet, leading to the crash you see. `import ROOT` makes sure everything is loaded and initialized by the time you deserialize.

Performance,"Thank you for the clarification. I had a closer look to this. The problem resides in that, during the deserialization, `libROOTPythonizations` is loaded, which in turn triggers the loading of `libcppyy`. Both libraries are extension modules. During the module initialization of `libROOTPythonizations`, it calls into `libcppyy`, but the latter has not been initialized yet (it has not been imported as a module), which causes the error. This does not happen during `import ROOT`, where all the imports are properly done. What I can try to do is ensure `libcppyy` is imported during the initialization of `libROOTPythonizations`. Let's see how that goes.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6552#issuecomment-710038856:146,load,loaded,146,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6552#issuecomment-710038856,2,['load'],"['loaded', 'loading']"

I'm in the process of addressing your comments, I only have one comment that I can't act on:. > * We need a test that checks attributes of the imported submodules.

Why is it exactly important to have all these attributes set? For the ROOT facade itself, it's easy to do (my PR does it in fact), but for arbitrary submodules I wouldn't know what to do. Often, the submodules are represented by C++ namespaces, so all these Python-module related dunder attributes are pretty meaningless. What exactly is your suggestion here?.

Performance,"Thanks Philippe. After further consideration, i think you're right. I had indeed been concerned about a possible deadlock, but i had thought; that it was probably ok because a similar change was working fine; in production. But (a), i had forgotten about the dlopen lock and (b),; they weren't exactly the same change. As i alluded to above, we didn't; want to have a custom patch to ROOT, so for production we address this; race by wrapping dlopen. But in that case, the core lock is acquired; _before_ the call to dlopen, not after. So, what is to be done?. There is probably only one code path in ATLAS that was giving us problems.; The Gaudi plugin manager was being used to load one of the POOL libraries; that happened to include ROOT dictionary information. I could; acquire the ROOT core lock around this (and one or two other places; where i known that Gaudi components may be loaded after event processing; starts). However, there are many other places where shared libraries; could potentially be loaded. While those probably don't matter...; the original bug here was quite opaque, taking several months; to completely track down. So i'm loathe to leave open any possibility; that it could bite us again. We could add locking within TClassTable. This is perhaps an attractive; way forward, as it should make it much easier to ensure that usages; of TClassTable are correct. A drawback is that is hard to then ensure; that we don't have something else that is also supposed to be protected; by the core mutex. Nevertheless, i could try to prepare a change; to do this if it sounds good. However, that's not the end of the problems. If this analysis is correct, then we _already_ have potential deadlock; problems, as there is nothing to prevent the initialization code of a; shared library (which can be arbitrary used code) from calling into ROOT; in a way that would acquire the core mutex. So code which would look; innocent to the user would have a chance of deadlocking.; I'm not sure ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071:679,load,load,679,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071,3,['load'],"['load', 'loaded']"

Performance,"Thanks a lot for this PR, that results from very intense debugging sessions initially enabled by @silverweed . Once the tests are green, I think these changes should be merged asap. There is no point in keeping around a fully jitted RDF+TTreeCache if it won't be used any more. After the aforementioned step is completed, we might perhaps think about what can go wrong with used memory and what we can do about it. For example, suppose a workflow with N dataframes. For some reason we do not control (e.g. some Dask internals or something imposed by the infrastructure) the scheduling is such that all of them are alive until the end of the processing. Can we cap the memory used by the caches? For example we could just keep 1 buffer and assign it to the tree cache of the chain associated to the RDF pulled from the worker's rdfs cache before using that RDF to process data (effectively using 1 single cache). De facto this means assuming N RDFs in flight but one TTreeCache buffer per worker.

EnableTH1 would activate the build of a specific dir behind the scenes.

Performance,"The main drawback of the ""temporary hack"" is that there is some duplication of information and operations now between the size of the vector and separate integer data members in the class which were previously needed to keep track of the size of the arrays. If migrating from bare arrays to ```std::vector``` to allow the compiler to autogenerate the constructors is the preferred solution (rather than implementing them by hand) then I can of course clean this up. For what concerns the readability of the code in C++11, one thing which could help a little bit and might be feasible is if ```std::apply``` were added to the STL backports. Another concern I had is that this implementation might be a bit slower than the previous individual cases if compiled without optimization (e.g. when jitted).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7499#issuecomment-805893760:767,optimiz,optimization,767,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7499#issuecomment-805893760,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Performance,"The only thing I see fixable (and not breaking existing use cases) is the case for returning integer types. Details:; - Unloading a transaction also unloads its generated code, AST, etc - that's violating a contract that existing uses rely on.; - `Calc` etc return whatever cast to long, since CINT, return a reference (cast to long) for ""objects"". As you know that means the temporary must be stored until the end of the process. Bad interface, but it is what it is, and breaking the interface contract is out of question.; - Memory allocated by `MachineFunctionPass` is likely the object code output of the JIT. It's a common use case to `Declare()` something and then `Calc()` say the address of a template instantiation - unloading the binary code after `Calc()` would again violate the usage contract.

Performance,"The problem with trying one after the other is that the number of combinations quickly goes through the roof. Consider that a python-side proxy can be freely converted from/to `T*`, `T**`, `T[]`, `T&`, `T&&`, and their `std::shared_ptr<>` and `std::unique_ptr<>` equivalents. So, that may mean 15 tries. If there are 3 arguments, the number of combinations is 455, faculty being what it is. Sure, I can make some educated guess to put the most likely candidates first, and that is basically when is currently going on. But a single lookupHelper call for template instantiation can already be too slow to be usable: e.g. for PCL they run (after the first 7-14s loading, which modules should fix) they are still of the order of 0.1s. (We have discussed that problem, too: contrary to normal Clang usage, Cling dumps everything in a single translation unit, vastly increasing the number of possible matches. Try going after `operator<<(std::ostream&)` or `operator==` in the global namespace, for example.). You mention int, but there are `int8_t`, `uint8_t` (these are often `char` varieties), `short`, `unsigned short`, `int16_t`, `uint16_t`, `int`, `unsigned int`, `long`, `unsigned long`, `long long`, and `unsigned long long` to try. Sure, let's do `str` to `const char*`, but that won't work for `std::string&`, and `std::string` usage is more common. But ah, what about `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`, `std::wstring`?. Collections, sure, but what if instead I have a tuple or list on the Python side and the template expects some STL container? Then it can not just be that STL container of say `T*`, but also the STL container of pointer any of the base classes, or worse, a mix thereof. And what if the tuple isn't actually targeting a container, but is an initalizer_list? There is often no (relevant) type information available at that point in Python, but many cases can still be resolved b/c the C++ side has some hints.

Performance,"This PR duplicates one of the commits in PR #1520 (that PR in addition addresses two more issues in JsMVA not related to the d3 change). As written in the description of PR #1520:. > The code has not been updated to reflect changes in jsroot. The code still tries to load d3.v3.min.js from jsroot. In the current version of jsroot the d3 script has been updated to version 4 and the file is now called d3.min.js. The pull request changes the name of the file in the two places where it is referenced, so it should now find the file. However this change is incomplete since the d3 API changes between the versions and some porting is needed. This PR does not introduce any other changes than changing the name of the js file in the two places where it is referenced in the code, just as PR #1520 does. The API of d3 v4 is not fully backward compatible with d3 v3. Did you go through the code and check that nothing else needs to be changed? In jsroot itself there were many other changes to the code to adapt to the changed API when the d3.js file was updated to v4 as seen in the commit:. https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/commit/c156b8956f77d1aef4b70cd8609c4b1f2036f94f#diff-26681b69718507c05077030d69e5ba58. One more comment: In addition to the change that changes the name of the d3.js file, this PR also proposes changes to some error messages in jsroot.

Performance,"This issue is very case-dependent.; When trying to calculate memory usage, normally the actual free memory on the system is `free + buffer + cached `. If shared memory usage is high (e.g mmaping a big cache) the calculation is slightly different:; `(free + buffer/cache) - shared`. The author of **htop** mentions on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55090900/how-can-i-calculate-memory-utilisation-of-a-linux-server-using-sar-report) question that htop uses this convention(in 2016):. - Total used memory = MemTotal - MemFree; - Non cache/buffer memory = Total used memory - (Buffers + Cached memory). Now htop (managed by htop-dev) uses this (on https://github.com/htop-dev/htop/blob/main/linux/LinuxMachine.c#L210):. ```; const memory_t usedDiff = freeMem + cachedMem + sreclaimableMem + buffersMem;; host->usedMem = (totalMem >= usedDiff) ? totalMem - usedDiff : totalMem - freeMem;; ```. This issue intends to merge the total used memory to include cached instead of just free which isn't strictly a correct solution. I have implemented the current approach utilised by **htop** which includes the following fields to calculate `MemUsed`, `MemAvailable` and `SwapUsed`:. ```; Int_t fMemAvailable; // available RAM in MB; Int_t fMemCached; // cached RAM in MB; Int_t fMemBuffer; // buffer RAM in MB; Int_t fMemShared; // shared RAM in MB; Int_t fSwapCached; // cached swap in MB; Int_t fSReclaimable // slab that might be reclaimed; ```; Fixed in ; - https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14695",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7196#issuecomment-1941955488:141,cache,cached,141,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7196#issuecomment-1941955488,9,"['Cache', 'cache']","['Cached', 'cache', 'cached', 'cachedMem']"

Performance,"Updates of the day:. ### 1; @Axel-Naumann suggested creating targets for the builtin_xrootd libraries . This should in theory give us the possibility of changing target properties through something like; `set(TARGET libXrdSecpwd-4 PROPERTY INSTALL_RPATH ${CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_LIBDIR})`. We still want to keep all the building process in the `ExternalProject_Add` step, thus these new targets would be created as IMPORTED libraries. But unfortunately, CMake doesn't allow to install IMPORTED libraries as TARGETS ([SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41179630), [CMake developer citation](https://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=14311) ). ### 2; I tried to create a post install script that manually invokes `install_name_tool` to change the rpath from the build directory to the install directory. This would be called in `SearchInstalledSoftware.cmake` through something like; `install(SCRIPT ""${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/modules/XROOTDPostInstall.cmake"")`; and the script itself would work along these lines; ```; file(GLOB XROOTD_ALL_LIBRARIES; ""${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/libXrd*""; ); find_program(INSTALL_NAME_TOOL install_name_tool). if(INSTALL_NAME_TOOL); foreach(XRD_LIB_PATH ${XROOTD_ALL_LIBRARIES}); set(OLD_RPATH ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/lib); set(NEW_RPATH ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib); execute_process(COMMAND ${INSTALL_NAME_TOOL} -rpath ${OLD_RPATH} ${NEW_RPATH} $$; endforeach(); endif(); ```; The problem with this idea, if not for its ad-hoc nature, is that `install_name_tool` would actually be called each time `cmake --install` is called causing errors from the second time since ${OLD_RPATH} is not set to the `build` folder anymore:; ```; error: install_name_tool: no LC_RPATH load command with path: /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/lib found in: /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/install/lib/libXrdClient.dylib (for architecture x86_64), required for specified option ""-rpath /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/lib /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/install/lib""; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6128#issuecomment-672083860:1704,load,load,1704,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6128#issuecomment-672083860,1,['load'],['load']
Performance,"Updates on the failing tests:; * Centos8/multicore: Failure because the same wrong mechanism of changing files happens in `FinalizeSlot` instead of `Finalize` in `SnapshotHelperMT`. Weirdly this didn't happen on my machine with 8 threads but it does on this node with 16 threads, still not sure what's the real difference there.; * MacOS: Both failures happen in the dataframe test, but in the **single threaded** Snapshot, that is in the `Finalize` method of the `SnapshotHelper` class. At first this PR wasn't even considering the single threaded case, that's also why `SnapshotHelper` wasn't modified. So there was this difference between the single threaded Snapshot that still used the weird ChangeFile behaviour (although it shouldn't have triggered a segfault anyway since it's using a plain TFile), and the multithreaded Snapshot that got its behaviour changed to avoid the issue. Considering both types of failures, and the fact that a coherent behaviour across the two Snapshot modes is desirable, I would refactor the usage of `TTree::SetMaxTreeSize` inside of RDF Snapshot in a single common point that both single-thread and multi-thread operations have to go through, if that exists. Or in alternative, the workaround should be done at construction time of both helpers and then removed at destruction time (or in `Initialize` and `Finalize` methods).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6570#issuecomment-720955137:1138,multi-thread,multi-thread,1138,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6570#issuecomment-720955137,1,['multi-thread'],['multi-thread']

Performance,"Vassil,. > We cannot control what's in the static init of user libraries. They can; use interpreter services. This approach used to work, why locking is; necessary? Aren't we 'just' reading?. Other threads could be trying to write the symbol tables at the same time,; so we still need to lock them for reading. In your case your lookup enters a generator (HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator),; so it will end up writing as well as reading. :). The right thing to do here is to refactor HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator; to do its work in two steps:; Step 1: Identify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested; symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you; should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ (; ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each; library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using; JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll; walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should; prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in; precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider; a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor; that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a; circular reference). I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock; (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like; this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so""; provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and; resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""...; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers a lookup in; the JIT for ""f"".; 2.2.1.

Performance,"What can be done here is rather simple. The bottleneck last time I checked is rootcling (dictionary generation). There are two reasons:; * cmake -- dictionary generation depends on LinkDef and header files and both artifacts are available from the beginning. However, the cmake build system does not have separate targets for dictionary generation and library generation. That leads to forcing rootcling to wait for the expensive linking step of each library. For example, instead of building `Y.pcm` once we are done with building `X.pcm` we wait for the linker to link `X.so`.; * rootcling is unnecessary slow -- the tool has grown organically and in many cases we make many iterations over the AST where we don't need them. Some of the larger scale ideas have been outlined here since years: https://github.com/root-project/root-evolution/pull/5 In fact, we don't need to get so much into the refactoring rootcling, attaching a profiler and seeing the bottlenecks should be easy.

Try to reproduce the problem with vanilla lli of LLVM 9 to check that this is not related to the way Cling incrementally JITs and executes.

Higher optimization levels (default is `-O2`) make the problem go away, as does `--global-isel=0`. So far, so consistent. > 2. Figure out exactly why GlobalISel emits different branch instructions, and whether this is a problem in the framework or of the generated IR.; > 3. Verify if the same happens with LLVM 11/12 (whatever Cling will move to next), and possibly fix the underlying issue in LLVM upstream's `main`. LLVM 11.1.0 does not show the problem with `lli -O0` by default due to https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/366ab0d086a457b085e3c9ba1c987d5499079cd6, but forcing `--global-isel=1` still fails.

Performance,"You're right! I misunderstood, I thought `std::rotate` rotated the whole iterable (e.g. like https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.roll.html), but I see now it only puts the selected part in front and shoves the rest aside to make room. But then apparently there are still situations that we are not catching. I think probably sometimes there will be yet another task executed before all tasks are in the queue. This is of course always possible, because the OS can delay processes and IPC in any way it sees fit. I can up the sleep time to compensate for this so it happens less often, but it is by the nature of the algorithm unavoidable that some statistical failures will still happen (given slow enough OS'es). What we can do to make sure that the test never fails is to iteratively go through all received tasks and modify the expected order until it matches, but of course in the extreme case that every step is reordered this would then defeat the purpose of the test. A more robust approach would be to wait with taking work off the queue until all tasks have been submitted, but this is not actually desirable functionality, because that would mean workers would be doing nothing when they could already be working. Introducing such functionality just for testing purposes seems silly. So not sure how to ""fix"" this.

Performance,"Your understanding is correct, you can go ahead with v6.24/00. For the compile time pinning, from the discussion we had yesterday, we can have architecture specific builds, so that, for example, `x86_64-centos7-gcc9-opt` will stick to the basic `x86-64` instructions, while `haswell-centos7-gcc9-opt` will do its best using AVX2 and all other goodies you get on that platform (we can also use the microarchitecture levels like `x86-64-v2` which will be available as of GCC 11 and Clang 12). For the RooFit specific case, our analysis does not use the builds from SFT and we do not use RooFit in trigger and reconstruction (which are the cases that I'm most worried about). Let's see from somebody in ATLAS what they think. I anyway (as a matter of principle) would prefer if you can have dynamic architecture dispatching that I can turn off in specific builds. @oshadura also mention possible optimizations in compression algorithms, but, again, that's a case that does not worry me, as they only deal with integers, so you do not get incompatible/incorrect results by changing the order of operations (unless there's a bug). The bottom line is that I'm worried about numerical instabilities due to the change of order of floating point operations in trigger and reconstruction code.

Performance,"[ (; ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each; library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using; JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll; walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should; prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in; precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider; a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor; that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a; circular reference). I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock; (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like; this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so""; provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and; resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""...; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers a lookup in; the JIT for ""f"".; 2.2.1. The lookup for ""f"" finds and runs the materializer for ""f"".; 2.2.2. The materializer for ""f"" reaches JITLink, which tries to resolve; symbol ""x"". There is no work to trigger (we started materializing it; already in (2.1)), so the link is suspended pending resolution of ""x"".; Critically, the dlopen cannot complete until the link completes.; 2.2. MU *would* dlsym ""x"", but it's blocked waiting on the dlopen to finish. And we're deadlocked again. The root cause of the problem is that ld.so and the JIT don't communicate; immediately about symbol resolutions. What we really wanted was for the; dlopen to register the library symbols with the JIT before it ran the; initializers, but that's just not the way dlopen works today.

The problem comes just from a single [line](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/5bf142749e2ee1f7d60e728bf7ac4262e1c22da0/clang/lib/Serialization/ASTReader.cpp#L3489) in clang. However fixing this would be very hard and might need to rework the source location management. That will be probably a good thing for clang since it is a bit inefficient how. We might be able to use some sort of binary tree to model them. I heard you talked this before. It looks interesting. And similar to above, I feel it will be more interesting to merge/re-use the source locations. Did you meet the problem of duplicated declarations?. For example, in C++20 modules, it is common:. ```; // A.cppm; module;; #include <iostream>; export module A;; ... // B.cppm; module;; #include <iostream>; export module A;; ... // C.cpp; import A;; import B;; ```.

This 'simulates' the CMSSW framework running to ROOT output modules concurrently (represented by the `group.run(activity)` calls ). Within each of those 'modules' 10 new identical TBB tasks are launched and the waited upon. If a task from one 'module' ever is run on the thread of the other module (i.e. the thread doing the `group.wait()`) the program prints ""WRONG THREAD"". The program can be built with the options to; - Turn off task_arena isolation (-DNO_ISOLATE) at the 'module' level (this would represent removing such isolate calls in CMSSW); - Add another task arena (-DOTHER) which represents the global ROOT arena.; - Add task_arena isolate within the other arena (-DOTHER_ISOLATE) which would represent what would happen if ROOT internally called isolate within your own arena.

Since RDataFrame **is not** the dataset itself, but just an interface to it, it still needs to open the file where the dataset is contained and read data from it. Thus, merging two RDF objects would still involve ` opening each file and saving them. Then loading them again and merging, then saving again` as you say above. Or at least the loading, merging and saving again part, if we consider that the part of your example where you create two files from scratch and save data into them with RDF could also just have been opening already existing files written by some other application before the merging. In fact the solution you provide follows exactly these steps:; > ; > ```python; > # Opening files and loading pre-existing datasets; > df_1=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_1); > df_2=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_2); > ; > # creating new columns in the datasets; > df_1=df_1.Define('identity', '+1'); > df_2=df_2.Define('identity', '+2'); > ; > # Merging the datasets in memory; > df_3 = df_1.Merge(df_2); > # Opening a new file and save the merged dataset into the new file; > df_3.Snapshot('tree', 'file.root'); > ```; > ; > I admit that I might not be able to see some internal optimizations that RDF might do while merging, but the logical steps seem to be equivalent to me. Or I also might be misinterpreting your proposal. No, the approaches are different. In the approach without `RDataFrame::Merge` I save twice the modified trees with the new column added, so the whole thing is slower than the second approach where the looping and saving can be done only once. . > ; > ## Current possible approaches; > If you need to process a dataset with RDF and need t",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927331768:2026,load,loading,2026,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927331768,2,['load'],['loading']

Performance,"e it back upstream.; > ; > I think all of us appreciate the time and brain power Vincenzo invests in improving the code. I bet it's useful to propose changes coming out of this upstream where relevant, @sudo-panda ?. Hi @Axel-Naumann ,. I am really grateful to @vepadulano for investing his precious time in reviewing this PR and suggesting changes to improve it. If not for his suggestions about the `namespace NumbaExt` code, I wouldn't have been able to simplify it. On the other hand, @vgvassilev is right about the global statements being a non-critical change and wouldn't be accepted upstream. And I am sure when he said that, he didn't mean that Vincenzo's efforts were wasteful. Finally, AFAIU Vincenzo thinks that global statements are unnecessary because the code acts in the same way whether you keep them or not. I have a few counterpoints to this:. 1. It gives programmers an idea about where the variable was initialized before use. Modifying the code provided by Vincenzo:. ```python; cache = {}. def foo():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""foo""] = 1. .....; .... Many lines of code ...; ..... def bar():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""bar""] = 2; ```. I hope you can see it becomes difficult to understand where did cache come from. A `global cache` statement at the top of the function or before its use clarifies the intent. 2. Removing the `global` statement doesn't affect the scope of the variable. It is purely meant to [guide Python for the code block it is used in.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement). 3. ROOT already uses `global` keyword in [JupyROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root/blame/a90d76b7798dc4332425d29794089fceaebccb60/bindings/jupyroot/python/JupyROOT/helpers/utils.py#L126 ). So unless ""we should never use `global`"" is a new convention being followed in ROOT, I believe it doesn't seem to track. 4.

Performance,"eant to be treated like a TTree. Otherwise I would also have to say that RDF is meant to be treated like a CSV file or something similar. > there should be a function that allows us to merge them. If I have to think about this function you propose, I don't see it going much further than the example you already have above. Since RDataFrame **is not** the dataset itself, but just an interface to it, it still needs to open the file where the dataset is contained and read data from it. Thus, merging two RDF objects would still involve ` opening each file and saving them. Then loading them again and merging, then saving again` as you say above. Or at least the loading, merging and saving again part, if we consider that the part of your example where you create two files from scratch and save data into them with RDF could also just have been opening already existing files written by some other application before the merging. In fact the solution you provide follows exactly these steps:; ```python; # Opening files and loading pre-existing datasets; df_1=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_1); df_2=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_2). # creating new columns in the datasets; df_1=df_1.Define('identity', '+1'); df_2=df_2.Define('identity', '+2'). # Merging the datasets in memory; df_3 = df_1.Merge(df_2); # Opening a new file and save the merged dataset into the new file; df_3.Snapshot('tree', 'file.root'); ```. I admit that I might not be able to see some internal optimizations that RDF might do while merging, but the logical steps seem to be equivalent to me. Or I also might be misinterpreting your proposal. ## Current possible approaches. If you need to process a dataset with RDF and need to concatenate parts of it, the current best approach is to use the `RDataFrame(TTree &tree)` constructor after having created the correct tree with all the information you need.

The enum-based optimization which I introduced in commit [""Improve performance by allowing most of cling::Value to inline""](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11252/commits/fa74b5419c3120ab4b5130e53a1844c54dc467c4). Unfortunately it did not show any improvement for callfunc. It helps with inlining the `castAs` operation but that does not bring benefits. That's why I decided to revert it but keep it in the history if we want to apply it. I can further spend time in trying to optimize this but that might be at the cost of making it harder to understand and maintain. If that performance info is acceptable, I will play a bit with a couple of ideas I have and move forward as that's blocking lowering parts of CallFunc to cling standalone. fyi @Axel-Naumann",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11252#issuecomment-1252723800:7690,optimiz,optimization,7690,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11252#issuecomment-1252723800,4,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimization', 'optimize', 'performance']"

Performance,"elevant, @sudo-panda ?. Hi @Axel-Naumann ,. I am really grateful to @vepadulano for investing his precious time in reviewing this PR and suggesting changes to improve it. If not for his suggestions about the `namespace NumbaExt` code, I wouldn't have been able to simplify it. On the other hand, @vgvassilev is right about the global statements being a non-critical change and wouldn't be accepted upstream. And I am sure when he said that, he didn't mean that Vincenzo's efforts were wasteful. Finally, AFAIU Vincenzo thinks that global statements are unnecessary because the code acts in the same way whether you keep them or not. I have a few counterpoints to this:. 1. It gives programmers an idea about where the variable was initialized before use. Modifying the code provided by Vincenzo:. ```python; cache = {}. def foo():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""foo""] = 1. .....; .... Many lines of code ...; ..... def bar():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""bar""] = 2; ```. I hope you can see it becomes difficult to understand where did cache come from. A `global cache` statement at the top of the function or before its use clarifies the intent. 2. Removing the `global` statement doesn't affect the scope of the variable. It is purely meant to [guide Python for the code block it is used in.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement). 3. ROOT already uses `global` keyword in [JupyROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root/blame/a90d76b7798dc4332425d29794089fceaebccb60/bindings/jupyroot/python/JupyROOT/helpers/utils.py#L126 ). So unless ""we should never use `global`"" is a new convention being followed in ROOT, I believe it doesn't seem to track. 4. As seen in this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4693392), Python used to differentiate between having a global statement or not. And even though the answer is more than ten years old, I experienced this firsthand when I started using Python (about four years b",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11096#issuecomment-1603484912:1242,cache,cache,1242,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11096#issuecomment-1603484912,2,['cache'],['cache']

Performance,"er. I have made a new commit, which addresses your and @hageboeck's review comments as much as possible. Point by point, let me quickly explain what changed:. - ""Upgraded"" comments on new functionality to doxygen. I did not doxygen document everything, because most functionality was copy-pasted from the old RooMinimizerFcn. The new things are now documented though.; - Renamed snake_case to dromedary.; - Use unique_ptr for parameter lists, as suggested by Stephan.; - Remove a few obsolete __ROOFIT_NOROOMINIMIZER flags (I guess these are part of the merge conflicts).; - I realized that part of what I changed in PR #8596 could (and imho should) have been introduced here already. I moved functionality to RooAbsMinimizerFcn, namely storage of the to-be-minimized function and constant term optimization information, but did not yet remove it (in this PR) from RooMinimizer. Now it has been removed.; - While going over the above, I realized I had actually *completely* forgot to add back in a backwards compatible way of enabling offsetting for numerical precision! This has now been correctly added back in. Then, about what I did not change:. - I did not have time for doing the include reordering/optimization that @hageboeck suggested. I tried to quickly figure it out, but I couldn't change things fast enough and still be able to guarantee that everything will still work in the later PRs that build on this one. I agree it would be nice, but I hope we can postpone this to some future PR, perhaps after the other additions have been merged.; - As mentioned earlier, RooAbsMinimizerFcn is basically a way to reduce code duplication. This should be seen in light of RooGradMinimizerFcn as well (see again PR #8596) and will also be used for a later addition. I think removing all data members and also the protected vs private suggestion would complicate this goal.

When it crashes, `nbig` is `-1`, and resize() expects and unsigned int. The -1 becomes a very large unsigned number that exceeds the maximum allowed length of a `std::string`. To me that looks more like a problem with IO than with HistFactory (the memory layout of the `HistFactory::Measurement` classes hasn't changed from 6.26 to 6.28. Is that something that makes sense to you, @pcanal? What does this `nbig` stand for, and in which circumstances can this be `-1`?. Maybe in the best case, the fix would just be adding a simple `if(nbig >= 0)` before the call to `resize()`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12967#issuecomment-1581261520:7671,optimiz,optimized,7671,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12967#issuecomment-1581261520,2,['optimiz'],['optimized']

I don't understand why though, the annotations inside the functions make no sense to me (showing more than 50% on a ` mov %ebx,%r8d` without something obvious around it). yeah, this is a bit tricky, the profiler is useful if you built in debug mode. What usually works is removing the `DynamicLibraryManagerSymbol.cpp.o` and copying the build command, changing it to clang and adding [a variation of] `-Rpass=inline -Rpass-missed=.*` (https://godbolt.org/z/xGEsGhf97). Then you can compare old and the new version for missed optimization opportunities. My feeling is that I mechanically added `.str()` everywhere as in some places we could have just used `string_view` and here this matters...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1089931729:3313,optimiz,optimization,3313,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1089931729,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Performance,"for good measure:. > We cannot control what's in the static init of user libraries. They can use interpreter services. This approach used to work, why locking is necessary? Aren't we 'just' reading?. Other threads could be trying to write the symbol tables at the same time, so we still need to lock them for reading. In your case your lookup enters a generator (HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator), so it will end up writing as well as reading. :). The right thing to do here is to refactor HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator to do its work in two steps:; Step 1: Identify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ ( ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a circular reference). I believe this will result in starvation or deadlock (depending on the number of threads involved). The failure path looks like this:. 1. A lookup for ""x"" enters the generator, which discovers that ""libx.so"" provides ""x"" and creates a MaterializationUnit, MU, to load ""libx.so"" and resolve ""x"".; 2.1 Outside the lock, MU dlopens ""libx.so""... ; 2.2. dlopen runs the initializers for ""libx.so"" which triggers a lookup in the JIT for ""f"".; 2.2.1. The lookup for ""f"" finds and runs the materia",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1104564382:1124,load,load,1124,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10294#issuecomment-1104564382,1,['load'],['load']

Performance,"g two RDF objects would still involve ` opening each file and saving them. Then loading them again and merging, then saving again` as you say above. Or at least the loading, merging and saving again part, if we consider that the part of your example where you create two files from scratch and save data into them with RDF could also just have been opening already existing files written by some other application before the merging. In fact the solution you provide follows exactly these steps:; ```python; # Opening files and loading pre-existing datasets; df_1=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_1); df_2=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_2). # creating new columns in the datasets; df_1=df_1.Define('identity', '+1'); df_2=df_2.Define('identity', '+2'). # Merging the datasets in memory; df_3 = df_1.Merge(df_2); # Opening a new file and save the merged dataset into the new file; df_3.Snapshot('tree', 'file.root'); ```. I admit that I might not be able to see some internal optimizations that RDF might do while merging, but the logical steps seem to be equivalent to me. Or I also might be misinterpreting your proposal. ## Current possible approaches. If you need to process a dataset with RDF and need to concatenate parts of it, the current best approach is to use the `RDataFrame(TTree &tree)` constructor after having created the correct tree with all the information you need. If for example you need to concatenate vertically 2 or more TTrees (i.e. if all have the same schema with column `a` and you want to append values of the same column into a single entity), than you can create a TChain and add all the trees to it. If you need horizontal concatenation (i.e. the trees have different schema but same number of entries) you can use friends pattern (e.g. `tree.AddFriend`). This has the big advantage that you don't need to merge any of the files/trees together and thus you also don't need to save them again before creating the RDF object. At the same time, once you do create the",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927091065:2178,optimiz,optimizations,2178,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9030#issuecomment-927091065,1,['optimiz'],['optimizations']

Performance,"ge_cast and static_range_cast #8769 (comment)](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#issuecomment-891036930): I didn't generalize TRangeDynCast and TRangeStaticCast. They are tied to TCollection and fulfill a different purpose because of that. They are also part of `ROOT::Internal`, while my new functions are supposed to be also used by the RooFit users. I would suggest we leave them as they are, but if you think the new `static_range_cast` and `dynamic_range_cast` are useful for everyone we can move the new file if you want. But where?. I was already expecting that it would be difficult to adapt those, but there will be ways to adapt them. I think it would be *better* if there's one good solution for all, but you have to decide how much time you want to invest. > 2. [[RF] New RangeCast file with dynamic_range_cast and static_range_cast #8769 (comment)](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8769#discussion_r680892053): I didn't add the `assert(dynamic_cast)` to the `static_range_cast` because the performance penalty it introduces in debug mode is not probably not expected by non-RooFit developers. There's not many loops out there in the world that will depend on this. If somebody uses it, they might be glad to have the extra safety. About the performance:; - When you run from the interpreter, you don't care about the performance of your loop as much.; - When you compile, you probably know what `NDEBUG` is.; - When you ACLIC-compile, I would have hoped that you get an automatic `NDEBUG` in release builds of ROOT, or when you `+O` a file. You don't, unfortunately. My preferred solution would have been to fix that and use the asserts, but it's your project now. > 3.

Performance,"gesting changes to improve it. If not for his suggestions about the `namespace NumbaExt` code, I wouldn't have been able to simplify it. On the other hand, @vgvassilev is right about the global statements being a non-critical change and wouldn't be accepted upstream. And I am sure when he said that, he didn't mean that Vincenzo's efforts were wasteful. Finally, AFAIU Vincenzo thinks that global statements are unnecessary because the code acts in the same way whether you keep them or not. I have a few counterpoints to this:. 1. It gives programmers an idea about where the variable was initialized before use. Modifying the code provided by Vincenzo:. ```python; cache = {}. def foo():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""foo""] = 1. .....; .... Many lines of code ...; ..... def bar():; .....; .... Many lines of code ...; .....; cache[""bar""] = 2; ```. I hope you can see it becomes difficult to understand where did cache come from. A `global cache` statement at the top of the function or before its use clarifies the intent. 2. Removing the `global` statement doesn't affect the scope of the variable. It is purely meant to [guide Python for the code block it is used in.](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement). 3. ROOT already uses `global` keyword in [JupyROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root/blame/a90d76b7798dc4332425d29794089fceaebccb60/bindings/jupyroot/python/JupyROOT/helpers/utils.py#L126 ). So unless ""we should never use `global`"" is a new convention being followed in ROOT, I believe it doesn't seem to track. 4. As seen in this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4693392), Python used to differentiate between having a global statement or not. And even though the answer is more than ten years old, I experienced this firsthand when I started using Python (about four years back). So even though Python changed how it treats the variable binding in the newer versions, I would say it doesn't harm us by keeping them",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11096#issuecomment-1603484912:1356,cache,cache,1356,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11096#issuecomment-1603484912,2,['cache'],['cache']

Performance,"guess the behavior of TTaskGroup should mimic what TThreadExecutor does, e.g. it should use the task arena if it exists, and it should construct one if it doesn't. What's the rationale for doing things independently of ROOT's task arena? Does this mean users might see more cores used than they expect in some cases?. I believe this change only removes an unnecessary restriction on when `TTaskGroup` can be used (i.e. after looking through the implementation, I don't think having IMT globally enabled is a precondition for the use of `TTaskGroup` and test benchmarks using this implementation seem to perform the same). > 2. Are you ok with silently do nothing if R__IMT is undefined? Would it be better to print a warning?. Thank you, yes, a warning would probably be better. > 3. Can we also have a way to disable RNTuple's multi-threading even if implicit MT is enabled, like TTree has?. Yes, this makes sense to me. It will probably need a big warning in the docs about when to call it and/or some graceful shutdown logic. Even if this PR doesn't make it that method might be valuable by itself. > the rationale behind my question is that we should not have N different multi-threading behaviors for N components. I completely agree, it is very nice to be able to say ""if you want multithreading, call `EnableImplicitMT` and you're done"". > and we should play well with the TBB settings of frameworks such as CMSSW, but it's not clear to me how we do that now, actually. For the RNTuple NanoAOD project, we were hoping to plug in the CMSSW tbb instance with `RPageStorage::SetTaskScheduler` (for both page sink and source): https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/a9c61d56afd70b74425779f330a4ec2cc581bb0b/tree/ntuple/v7/inc/ROOT/RPageStorage.hxx#L136. by implementing a derived `RTaskScheduler` on the CMSSW side so they have control over task isolation etc. ; https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/4118c0cb6db03998ae77f56f57cc372ac150c9df/tree/ntuple/v7/inc/ROOT/RPageStorage.hxx#L66-L76",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8334#issuecomment-854977563:1233,multi-thread,multi-threading,1233,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8334#issuecomment-854977563,2,['multi-thread'],['multi-threading']

Performance,"hDegree(x, std::log(low), std::log(high), std::log(nominal), boundary));; return total * interpolate6thDegree(x, low, high, nominal, boundary);; ```. This (together with using the old code as commented out above) indeed gets rid of the `nan`!. **I think the crucial part is that the old code checks for `high <= 0` and also `low <= 0`.**. Indeed, I traced the `nan` there: the sequence of events in this failing example is that `high` is zero, so that `std::log(high)` is `-inf`. Then `eps_plus` is also `-inf` and so `S` and `A` too, so you `-inf` times something negative (`t` happens to be negative in this example) so the term becomes `+inf` and eventually you get a `-inf + inf` and that equals `nan`. So, there's at least two options to fix this, both will need some conditionals added in again. 1. Going back to the original algorithm. If I understand the commit message of that change correctly, it was mostly removed because it required cached variables. As I rewrote the algorithm above, no more cached variables are necessary. Of course, it does involve more temporary values than the new algorithm, so perhaps this is another reason to pick the new algorithm.; 2. Adding similar `<= 0` checks to the new algorithm. I think this should take place at the call site, because it doesn't make sense for the other `interpolate6thDegree` usecase where no weird values are expected from logarithms. By the way, why is the interpolation taking place in logarithmic space instead of regular linear space and then transformed back into linear space after interpolation? Doesn't this also mean that the two interpolation schemes (FlexibleInterpVar and PiecewiseInterpolation) are again inconsistent? If the logarithm can be eliminated, I think we can do without introducing conditionals, no? That is, assuming the high and low vectors are filled sensibly, which is not checked anywhere as far as I can see, so that's still a minor weakness, but I guess that could easily be added in the documentation",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13749#issuecomment-1746494427:1166,cache,cached,1166,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13749#issuecomment-1746494427,1,['cache'],['cached']

Performance,"ike a TTree. Otherwise I would also have to say that RDF is meant to be treated like a CSV file or something similar. I did not refer to the documentation but to how people would actually use this class. 99% of people do not read CSV files with ROOT and `RDataFrame` will be mostly used to interact in a simple and quick way with trees. > ; > > there should be a function that allows us to merge them; > ; > If I have to think about this function you propose, I don't see it going much further than the example you already have above. Since RDataFrame **is not** the dataset itself, but just an interface to it, it still needs to open the file where the dataset is contained and read data from it. Thus, merging two RDF objects would still involve ` opening each file and saving them. Then loading them again and merging, then saving again` as you say above. Or at least the loading, merging and saving again part, if we consider that the part of your example where you create two files from scratch and save data into them with RDF could also just have been opening already existing files written by some other application before the merging. In fact the solution you provide follows exactly these steps:; > ; > ```python; > # Opening files and loading pre-existing datasets; > df_1=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_1); > df_2=ROOT.RDataFrame('tree', file_path_2); > ; > # creating new columns in the datasets; > df_1=df_1.Define('identity', '+1'); > df_2=df_2.Define('identity', '+2'); > ; > # Merging the datasets in memory; > df_3 = df_1.Merge(df_2); > # Opening a new file and save the merged dataset into the new file; > df_3.Snapshot('tree', 'file.root'); > ```; > ; > I admit that I might not be able to see some internal optimizations that RDF might do while merging, but the logical steps seem to be equivalent to me. Or I also might be misinterpreting your proposal. No, the approaches are different.
