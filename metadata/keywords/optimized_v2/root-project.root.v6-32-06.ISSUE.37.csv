Modifiability,"TLDR: `TTree* TMVA::DataSet::GetTree` is missing a call to `tree->ResetBranchAddresses()` at the end. The interesting bit is that `TBufferFile::ReadInt` is being used even-though all the variables in the example (and indeed all their corresponding branches) are floats. So the issue is that the address of the Int branch:; ```; *Br 0 :classID : classID/I *; ```; is still set to an address that uses to be on the stack (according to valgrind). How can it be possible, you may ask. Well ... looking at the result of `fOutputFile->ls("""")` we notice:; ```; ....; OBJ: TTree TestTree TestTree : 0 at: 0x5555555eae70; ```; **even before** the call to `fOutputFile.Get(""dataset/TestTree"");`.

Modifiability,"Thanks @amadio for the extensive input! Let me address it point by point:. First: the current choice for ""built-in only"". The built-in is there for two reasons: 1) as a dependency, obviously, but 2) also because the full source is needed to build `zmq::ppoll`. `ppoll` was written as an extension to libzmq itself. In the ideal world, I would have committed this back to libzmq (which they are open to, and which I'll do later, see https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/4220), but haven't had time yet. The interim solution is to just ship it with ROOT, but this requires (part of) the libzmq source to build against. We can do this in two ways: a) just include the necessary libzmq files or b) get them externally on the fly. I actually went with option a) first. However, when people started trying out this branch on their machines, it turned out that the `conda` libzmq build (which I was using in my dev setup) had a more favorable configuration than for instance most Linux native builds, especially because those native builds lack CMake configuration files. That latter fact made me decide to just make the built-in dependency the default; this way I wouldn't have to figure out how to best detect libzmq on each platform (or find / cobble together a good and freely licensed FindZeroMQ.cmake, but the general feeling around the ZeroMQ community is that this is a waste of effort, because the CMake config files that come along with libzmq itself already solve this finding problem; it's just unfortunate that the Linux distro's won't include them...). So in the end, because of time constraints, I made the choice to prioritize other things over putting a lot of effort into this dependency which will probably end up different in the near future anyway (because of the ppoll PR, which will make things a lot easier on the ROOT side). So, long story, I hope it is clear. Do you think that given this (temporary) situation, the choice for built-in only is acceptable?.

Modifiability,"Thanks Philippe. After further consideration, i think you're right. I had indeed been concerned about a possible deadlock, but i had thought; that it was probably ok because a similar change was working fine; in production. But (a), i had forgotten about the dlopen lock and (b),; they weren't exactly the same change. As i alluded to above, we didn't; want to have a custom patch to ROOT, so for production we address this; race by wrapping dlopen. But in that case, the core lock is acquired; _before_ the call to dlopen, not after. So, what is to be done?. There is probably only one code path in ATLAS that was giving us problems.; The Gaudi plugin manager was being used to load one of the POOL libraries; that happened to include ROOT dictionary information. I could; acquire the ROOT core lock around this (and one or two other places; where i known that Gaudi components may be loaded after event processing; starts). However, there are many other places where shared libraries; could potentially be loaded. While those probably don't matter...; the original bug here was quite opaque, taking several months; to completely track down. So i'm loathe to leave open any possibility; that it could bite us again. We could add locking within TClassTable. This is perhaps an attractive; way forward, as it should make it much easier to ensure that usages; of TClassTable are correct. A drawback is that is hard to then ensure; that we don't have something else that is also supposed to be protected; by the core mutex. Nevertheless, i could try to prepare a change; to do this if it sounds good. However, that's not the end of the problems. If this analysis is correct, then we _already_ have potential deadlock; problems, as there is nothing to prevent the initialization code of a; shared library (which can be arbitrary used code) from calling into ROOT; in a way that would acquire the core mutex. So code which would look; innocent to the user would have a chance of deadlocking.; I'm not sure ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071:646,plugin,plugin,646,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071,1,['plugin'],['plugin']

Also, it's more flexible.

Why do we need another switch for `REFLEX_GENERATE_DICTIONARY`? We should be able to deduce the include paths from the target configurations. Passing different include paths using `USES` would mean that your dictionary has a different set of header files (compiled in a different way) than the library the dictionary is compiled in. That's quite dangerous as it can bring hard to diagnose inconsistencies. The direction ROOT has taken in the past is that it encourages single cmake call to produce library and its dictionaries. This is what `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` is.

In that case they would not compile because not all purely virtual functions are implemented.

Modifiability,"Thanks for the great comments @guitargeek! All the ones I didn't comment on I agree with, so will implement those soon. I agree that it has become quite a complex class. It would be nice if things could be refactored at some time. However, part of it is also inevitable, I fear, because `RooMinimizer` has to bridge between two rather different frameworks, that of Minuit2 and RooFit, and now due to all the parallel processing work will have to deal with even more stuff than before. By the way, just as a historical aside: at some point I had turned `RooMinimizer` into a fully templated class, which made it even more horrible to maintain and time consuming to develop (since the header had to be recompiled on every change). I managed to trim the template horror down to just the constructor by introducing `RooAbsMinimizerFcn`. That introduced its own complexity here and there, as we discussed above :) But it was better in the end, I think. Note that the sole reason the template parameter is still necessary in the constructor is that the `MinimizerFcn` needs the proper constructor inside the `RooMinimizer` constructor. I like your suggestion of also using the template class argument instead of the `dynamic_cast` using `std::is_same`, but this is not strictly necessary like using the proper constructor is. By the way, note also that in the upcoming TestStatistics PR, there will be yet another `RooMinimizer` constructor, also with template arguments, but different ones, namely the concrete calculator classes for the likelihood and gradient.

Modifiability,"Thanks for the reference, @vepadulano ! . If `TRint` is indeed purely for use in `root.exe`, this is news to me (and some other colleagues), since the documentation of the class does not seem to state it's internal — it's used in our analysis software, the analysis software we inherited from (a decade ago, from a different collaboration), various student analyses etc. . As described above, the main use case is something for which no alternate class seems to exist:; * Start an application, and prepare an environment (e.g. an analysis framework). ; * Drop to the interpreter at some point later, e.g. during the first event. ; * Allow to interactively study the in-memory objects via the interpreter shell. . Note that I fully agree with the notion that `root.exe` should exit when encountering unrecognized options. However, the class is actively and successfully used in many projects I know (due to it's usefulness), and there is no easy replacement. So if it's internal, I'd probably vote for something like `TApplicationInterpreter` which would be similar to `TRInt`, but without the newly added `root.exe` specifics, and could be used by external projects (to prevent the need for external projects to replicate `TRint`). .

Modifiability,"The fact that `wait_for_workers` waits forever looks to me like the Dask job is never actually started. You should double check that a simple Dask application with the same config but doing something else unrelated to RDF is working.

Coming back to RDF, the `npartitions` parameter corresponds to how many distributed tasks will be sent to the Dask scheduler. Supposing you know something about how many resources you have or the layout of your ROOT dataset, you could set this manually in the RDataFrame constructor like; ```python; df = RDataFrame(""treename"",""filename.root"",daskclient=client,npartitions=NPARTITIONS); ``` ; A good parallelisation can often be obtained when the number of partitions is roughly 3x the amount of cores you can use.; UPDATE:. > in particular I'm interested in using Dask's adaptive worker management, so that the exact number of submitted jobs is not fixed a priori but automatically adapts to the workload...

Modifiability,"The failure in `test_snapshot_manytasks` is due to the following issue, introduced by this PR (and the previous failure in `test_snapshot` on 32 and 64 bit might be due to the same issue:. At the beginning of a task a new input TChain replaced the old input; TChain for that _thread_ in TTreeProcessorMT, causing a destruction of; the previous _thread-local_ TTree.; At the same time, the initialization of a new task _in a different; thread_ could delete the output TTree of a multi-thread Snapshot; action, which was listed in the fClones of the input TTree.; ; This race caused the input ~TTree to access an output tree just; after its deletion, in TTree::CopyAddresses.; ; The root cause of this issue is that TTreeProcessorMT uses thread-local; variables while RDataFrame uses processing slots which threads can; exchange between themselves. I see two options to solve this:; 1. we introduce a `FinalizeTask` method in all `RDataFrame` action helpers, and we use it in `SnapshotHelperMT` to delete the output trees when we are sure that the input tree is still in scope. This is quite easy.; 2. we have `TTreeProcessorMT` delete its thread-local `TChain`s at the end of one task, not at the beginning of the next task in that thread. @etejedor @dpiparo what do you think?; I know @amadio would be happy if we introduced a `FinalizeTask` method in symmetry with the `InitTask` that we already have",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2197#issuecomment-398737985:750,variab,variables,750,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2197#issuecomment-398737985,1,['variab'],['variables']

And the variable names should not lead to confusion with formula evaluation in Draw (e.g. branch names which are pure numbers). The tests suggested here are:; - test if branch name is a valid c++ variable name (w/o testing keywords).; - test if branch name begins with ""b_"" (potential problem with MakeClass). on top of that, I also have a [black list](https://github.com/pseyfert/tmva-branch-adder/blob/master/src/blacklist.cpp) of unfortunate branch names: methods of TTrees, which would clash in MakeClass, c++ keywords, variable types, and things TTree::Draw can parse (though I don't see how `TTree::Draw(""cos(x)"")` would clash with `TTree::Draw(""cos"")` if there is a variable named `cos`.

Modifiability,"The main change in this PR is that the `CustomColumn` term is replaced by the clearer, shorter `Define` term. This require quite a few changes all over RDataFrame internals. Motivation for the change can be found below, copy-pasted from the commit message. This will make future backports a bit of a pain, but I think it's worth doing it now, for the following reasons:; * we are at a historical low of RDF-related open bugs -> less backports are expected in the future; * recent large refactorings in RAction.hxx (#6220) and in the column reader logic (#6170) already make backports much less likely to apply cleanly to release branches, so if there is a less bad time to do this, it's probably now; * expected upcoming refactorings necessary to support bulk entry processing will put another nail in the coffin of backportable bug-fixes; * I think we can all agree that RCustomColumn is a terribly opaque name for something that at this point we all know as a ""Define"", and in a few years I'd rather not have doctoral students complain about how my class names are completely arbitrary and unnecessarily hard to understand . The original commit message:. Until recently, RCustomColumns could correspond to data-source columns; or defined columns. Due to recent refactorings, RCustomColumns are now; back to serving only their original purpose: representing Define nodes; in the computation graph.; RCustomColumn is a very opaque name, and it crops up when debugging,; reading code and looking at performance profilings. The new name,; RDefine, clearly describes what the class is supposed to do and it is in; line with RDF's naming convention (we already have RFilter).

The difference can be shown with `otool -l`; ```; $ otool -l build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so > libXrdSecpwd_buildlib.txt; $ otool -l build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src/libXrdSecpwd-4.so > libXrdSecpwd_xrootdprefixlib.txt; $ diff libXrdSecpwd_buildlib.txt libXrdSecpwd_xrootdprefixlib.txt; < build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so:; ---; > build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src/libXrdSecpwd-4.so:; 307a308,311; > cmd LC_RPATH; > cmdsize 80; > path /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/XROOTD-prefix/src/XROOTD-build/src (offset 12); > Load command 14; 312c316; < Load command 14; ---; ```. This `LC_RPATH` variable is set for our own libraries, e.g. `libHtml.so`; ```; $ otool -l build/lib/libHtml.so; [...]; Load command 15; cmd LC_RPATH; cmdsize 80; path /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/lib (offset 12); ```; But for some reason this information is lost after building `builtin_xrootd` (probably while installing the libraries from the prefix to the install directory). A way to solve this is by manually adding the `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH` option to the `cmake` invokation of `builtin_xrootd` as is done in this PR. The result is:; ```; $ otool -l build/lib/libXrdSecpwd-4.so; [...]; Load command 15; cmd LC_RPATH; cmdsize 80; path /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/bui",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6128:281,Plugin,Plugin,281,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6128,2,"['Plugin', 'variab']","['Plugin', 'variable']"

Ideally, `MnApplication` should hold a smart pointer to `ModularFunctionMinimizer`, which is initialized with a concrete instance by each derived class. The method `Minimizer()` wouldn't be virtual and overloaded in each derived class. There could just be two normal methods in `MnApplication` for const and non-const access to the internal smart pointer. The `MnApplication` would get a modified constructor that accepts the raw pointer of `ModularFunctionMinimizer` created in each derived class.

Modifiability,"The problem is that LLVM ships with zlib. Since recently, we meld the header files of the PCH in a zip in it (fa9a2eee8376a0d4c4393b8f94fa3f841455c32d). Clang uses zlib [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/interpreter/llvm/src/tools/clang/lib/Serialization/ASTReader.cpp#L1302) and [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/interpreter/llvm/src/tools/clang/lib/Serialization/ASTWriter.cpp#L2052) when building the PCH in `-fmodules-embed-all-files` mode. IIUC, the issue is the way the JIT resolves symbols. Currently, cling's JIT gives a preference to the local content to itself, i.e. resolves symbols from libCling.so first. This would mean that even if we link another version of zlib to libCore, cling will still find the symbols from llvm's library. And that's by design, because we want to resolve the embedded in ROOT LLVM symbols first. Otherwise cling will start picking up random LLVM symbols introducing a lot of compatibility and versioning issues. I'd propose we try to solve this in two steps. First we should try disabling LLVM's zlib from `interpreter/CMakeLists.txt` instead of the current patch. I suspect that LLVM will be able to find and use the system's zlib (in that case we should make sure LLVM links to the version of zlib we expect: @oshadura has a nice test case for it).

Modifiability,"The reason for this behaviour seems to be that all the Python classes in the reproducer (`B`, `C` and `D`) get a `Dispatcher` wrapper class automatically created (`Dispatcher1`, `Dispatcher2` and `Dispatcher3`, respectively) that inherits from `A`. Since for `B` and `C` `fun1` is overridden in Python, `Dispatcher1` and `Dispatcher2` define a `fun1` implementation that redirects the call to the Python `fun1` of `B` and `C`, respectively. That is not the case of `D`, whose `Dispatcher3` defines no `fun1`. What I described above explains the behaviour reported in this ticket. When calling `d.fun2()`, which in turn calls `fun1`, the latter will be resolved to `A::fun1`, whereas one would expect that it is the `fun1` defined in Python by `B` that is called instead. This issue does not exist in upstream cppyy: `Dispatcher3` inherits from `Dispatcher1` (`B`'s dispatcher) and not from `A` directly, which means that the call to `fun1` from `fun2` will be resolved to `Dispatcher1::fun1`, which will redirect the call to Python (`B`'s `fun1`).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6470#issuecomment-713715166:230,inherit,inherits,230,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6470#issuecomment-713715166,2,['inherit'],['inherits']

RooArgSet inherits from RooAbsCollection, so it should be possible to add a RootArgSet instance to an other RootArgSet instance via `add()`. This used to work in versions prior to 6.06/00. From [`RooArgSet.h in 6.05/02`](https://github.com/root-mirror/root/blob/v6-05-02/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooArgSet.h#L90):. ```cpp; class RooArgSet : public RooAbsCollection {; public:; ...; virtual Bool_t add(const RooAbsCollection& list, Bool_t silent=kFALSE) {...}; };; ```. This was changed in commit 283f080, where e.g. the above `add` function was replaced by. ```cpp; using RooAbsCollection::add;; ```. However, this only seems to work when the *used* function is implemented in the base class' header or re-implemented by the inheriting class' which both is not the case. Therefore, I added the functions again to the RooArgSet header.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/325:420,inherit,inherits,420,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/325,2,['inherit'],"['inheriting', 'inherits']"
Modifiability,"This PR adds `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, an alternative to `RooMinimizerFcn` that calculates gradient itself outside of Minuit during minimization. To be able to use `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, `RooMinimizer` had to be refactored to be able to use `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` instead of the concrete RooMinimizerFcn class. To accomodate this change, several other changes had to be made:; - `_optConst` and `_func` members were removed, since these are now managed by the `*MinimizerFcn`.; - This means also things like function name and title, but also optimization switches, were moved to `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` as well.; - Functions `getMultiGenFcn`, `fitterFcn` and `fitFcn` were added which are used in several places as convenience functions to access the concrete `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` object with its proper type. The concrete type matters, for instance, when passing the class to the derivator, because a gradient enabled `*MinimizerFcn` needs to take different overloads than the classic function-value-only `RooMinimizerFcn`. A `FcnMode` enum class was added for this disambiguation as well.; - Construction of a `RooMinimizer` can be done the same as always when using a classic `RooMinimizerFcn`. However, to activate `RooGradMinimizerFcn`, a new create function can be used with the proper type as template parameter. In a later PR, this pattern will be extended with another gradient-enabled `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` instantiation that will also include multi-processing implementations. Since we had to refactor construction, we took the opportunity to also put default parameters in the header declaration, instead of in the constructor initializer lists. Finally, this PR changes the default minimizer from Minuit to Minuit2. **Note that this may require some discussion.** We already briefly touched upon this in a Zoom meeting, but haven't thoroughly mapped out consequences yet. The reason for the switch is that the derivator scheme used in `RooGradMinimizerFcn` replicates that of Minuit2, so comparing",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8596:209,refactor,refactored,209,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8596,1,['refactor'],['refactored']

We added a subclass of the AnalyticalGradientCalculator called the ExternalInternalGradientCalculator. Whereas the AGC assumes that the gradient that is passed to it (from outside of Minuit2) is in normal parameter space, the EIGC allows its (External) user to use Minuit2 ""Internal"" parameter space, i.e. the parameter space that may be bounded into some range using transformation functions. This allowed us to exactly (floating point bit-wise) replicate the Minuit2 gradient calculation outside of Minuit2 itself, allowing us to parallelize this gradient calculation process exactly without having to worry about breaking Minuit2. The replication, `NumericalDerivatorMinuit2`, was based on earlier work by @lmoneta who already had separated out the bulk of the gradient calculation code from Minuit2.; 2.

This is because the weight calculation is using the nSum that is 0 when binning is not used; Inversing that gives the infinity in the Iteration:Fixed case. This fix:; - adds the call to SetBinCountData() in InitFromNewData(); - recreates the kernel fun pointer (previously fKernel ends up a `nullptr`); - calculating nSum as fNEvents if not binning in TKDE::TKernel::operator(). Results:. ```cpp; auto kde = new TKDE(0, nullptr, 0, 5, ""KernelType:Gaussian;Iteration:Adaptive;Mirror:noMirror;Binning:RelaxedBinning"", 1);; for (unsigned int i = 0; i < 100; i++) { kde->Fill(gRandom->Gaus(2,1)); }; std::cout<<kde->GetValue(2)<<""\n""; ; ```.

Modifiability,"This Pull request extends `RPageSink::RPageSinkDaos` to implement `RPageSinkDaos::CommitSealedPageVImpl()`, of signature: ; ```c++; vector<RNTupleLocator> RPageSinkDaos::CommitSealedPageVImpl(span<RPageStorage::RSealedPageGroup> ranges); ```; , which is virtually declared in the parent class `RPageSink` since PR #10775. . The implemented method modifies the default behavior for committing page ranges, i.e. calling `::CommitSealedPage` repeatedly for each individual page. ; Instead, it coalesces the buffered page ranges - e.g. all pages in a column or cluster - into a batch of vector writes, enabling I/O parallelization after recent optimizations to the `RDaos` library. . As with the batched fetching case in `RPageSourceDaos::LoadClusters()`, the page write requests are aggregated by the pair (Object ID, Distribution Key). This pair is part of the `RDaosKey` determined by the mapping strategy set in `kDefaultDaosMapping` from the pages metadata and the `RPageSinkDaos` instance's atomic counter `fPageId` that uniquely identifies pages in the storage sink. ## Changes or fixes:. * Implements `std::vector<RNTupleLocator> RPageSinkDaos::CommitSealedPageVImpl(std::span<RPageStorage::RSealedPageGroup> ranges)`; * Modifies the default behavior in `RPageSink::CommitSealedPageV()` to coalesce pages before sending out the write request to storage; * Enables optimized (i.e. batched) vector write requests of multiple pages within a column range by exploiting the refactored `RDaos` interface and the generalized ntuple-object mappings in `RPageStorageDaos`. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally and on openlab cluster `olsky-03` with DAOS 2.0.x; - [ ] updated the docs (if necessary).

Modifiability,"This Pull request refactors `RPageSourceDaos::LoadClusters()` to coalesce the fetch requests for pages in the same cluster bunch before calling `RDaosContainer::ReadV`, instead of launching a call to remote storage for the pages of each cluster separately. A cluster bunch corresponds to all clusters being fetched together by `LoadClusters()` at a time. . Since the call by `ReadV()` is ultimately blocking until all requests are done, this change enables the asynchronous page fetch requests from different clusters to share queue and flight time; thus, remote storage can parallelize them toward a higher read throughput. . The requests are still coalesced according to object ID and distribution key resulting from the mapping strategy in `kDefaultDaosMapping`. The modification allows support for new mappings that do not feature the ntuple cluster ID among the object ID and distribution key (i.e. such page requests may now be parallelized despite not being from the same cluster). ## Changes or fixes:; - `RPageSourceDaos::LoadClusters()` has been refactored to batch up page requests from all provided clusters before the blocking `RDaosContainer::ReadV()` call. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally + openlab `olsky-03`; - [ ] updated the docs (if necessary)",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10982:18,refactor,refactors,18,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/10982,2,['refactor'],"['refactored', 'refactors']"

Modifiability,"This commit enables serialization of the Python proxy defined within cppyy to the C++ std::runtime_error class. By doing so, we avoid errors that happen in certain configurations of Dask tasks where a std::runtime_error may be thrown within the event loop itself. Recent CI failures report the following:. ```; RDataFrame::Run: event loop was interrupted; Warning in <TBufferFile::WriteObjectAny>: since runtime_error has no public constructor; 	which can be called without argument, objects of this class; 	can not be read with the current library.

This is due to the fact that for some reason the std::runtime_error object is serialized at the end of the function scope within the Dask task.

Modifiability,"This commit provides a rewrite of key functions of TGeoParallelWorld, achieving: . (a) faster initialization; (b) faster execution of the Safety function (from ~O(N) to ~O(1)) ; (c) faster or equal execution of FindNode/FindBoundary functions (~log(N)) ; (d) less memory consumption (better memory scalability). The development for this commit was motivated from a use case in ALICE, in which the parallel world ""scene"" can be very large (~100K volumes). In this case, TGeoVoxelFinder takes very long; to construct and consumes a very large amount of memory (GBs). In addition, the evaluation of the Safety function dominates the Geant simulation time. The improvements in this commit are mainly achieved through:. * The use of a boundary volume hierarchy (BVH) as the base acceleration entity, replacing TGeoVoxelFinder.; BVH are the standard in industry/computer-graphics, for what concerns ray-object intersection tasks. The BVH is constructed from axis-aligned bounding boxes and employed in the FindBoundary/FindNode implementations. * The use of a 3D voxel grid (TGeoVoxelGrid) structure, able to store properties ""local"" or in the vicinity of a cartesian coordinate P. This structure allows to reduce the (typical) algorithmic complexity for ""Safety"" queries to ~O(1) (with a constant factor determined by the voxel size). Filling of the 3D voxel grid cache for Safety is done on-the-fly (using the BVH once). * (Optional) Additional caching of ""last-call"" safety values for really quick return when the value is still valid at the next call. Ideas for these improvements come from prior work in related libraries such as VecGeom. -----. Implementation details:. * The implementation is, for now (until fully tested), provided in a backward compatible manner:. - By default, nothing changes; - Users have to activate the BVH mode by setting an environment variable TGEO_PW_USEBVH; - Users may hence compare the 2 modes. * Functions for Safety, FindNode, FindBoundary dispatch to some internal i",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16442:23,rewrite,rewrite,23,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16442,1,['rewrite'],['rewrite']

Modifiability,"This commit provides the possibility to pass system library search paths as well as some compiler include paths to ROOT as environment variables.; This has the advantage that ROOT will spawn less sub-processes and we can do the setup only once, instead of doing it for every single executable that is linked to ROOT. The commit does not change any default behaviour! Rather, expert-users may use the new feature by moving the initialization of the search paths to say software environment loading. In ALICE, we do something like. ```; export ROOT_LDSYSPATH=$(LD_DEBUG=libs LD_PRELOAD=DOESNOTEXIST ls /tmp/DOESNOTEXIST 2>&1 | grep -m 1 ""system search path"" | sed 's/.*=//g' | awk '//{print $1}'). export ROOT_CPPSYSINCL=$(LC_ALL=C c++ -xc++ -E -v /dev/null 2>&1 | sed -n '/^.include/,${/^ \/.*++/{p}}' | tr '\n' ':' | tr ' ' ':'); ```. speeding up the initialization of our executables at runtime and doing less syscalls that create short-lived processes, for instance calling the compiler. The effect from this operation can be seen by counting the `execve` syscalls in a small example:. ```; strace -e execve -f root.exe -q -e ""double x=1;"" # ---> 14 calls. export ROOT_LDSYSPATH=...; export ROOT_CPPSYSINCL=...; strace -e execve -f root.exe -q -e ""double x=1;"" # ---> 6 calls; ```.

Modifiability,"This commit removes some functions from the RooFit data classes:. * `RooAbsData::valid()` (virtual method that was overridden in; RooDataHist but not RooDataSet). * `RooDataHist::valid(std::size_t i)` and `RooDataHist::valid()`. * `RooDataHist::cacheValidEntries()`. The `cacheValidEntries` method was originally intended to be used in; `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` to mask histogram entries out of the variable; range in case of a subrange fit. The reasons why `cacheValidEntries` and; the related `valid()` methods should be removed are:. 1. It is redundant. In a subrange fit, the `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` is; creating a clone of the dataset with the subrange only using; `RooAbsData::reduce()`. So all entries are valid by definition. 2. RooDataHist and RooDataSet have inconistent implementations. For; the RooDataHist, `valid()` tells you ""if bin `i` is considered; valid within the current range definitions of all observables""; (according to the documentation). For the RooDataSet, it always; returns `true`. This inconsistency leaves plenty of room for error. 3. The masking of out-of-range entries unnessecarily increases the; `mutable` state of the RooDataHist, which can cause trouble if one; updates the observable range but then forgets to call; `cacheValidEntries()`. 4.

The crux of the issue #9543 is:. * TClass::fSizeof info prefers the information from the CollectionProxy; * TStreamerInfo::fSize is set to the value of TClass::fSizeOf; * TClass:New prefers the constructor from the interpreter; * TStreamerInfo::New was using TClass::New for that case; * On the failing platform, the `sizeof(std::map<int,std::vector<int>>)` is larger than the size of the emulated collection. Since the I/O and TStreamerInfo uses the TCollection proxy and all of TStreamerInfo needs to prefer the information from the collection proxy (including the 'sizeof'). To fix #9543 the solution is for; * TStremearInfo::New to prefer/use TCollectionProxy::New over TClass::New (i.e. the interpreted constructor in this particular case).",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9581:285,config,config,285,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9581,3,['config'],['config']

The aforementioned implementation prevented the support for friend chains, since there was no chain to add the friends to, only trees. In this new implementation, TTreeProcessorMT always constructs a chain per TTreeView, from which TTreeReaders are created to operate on ranges of the chain.

This was fine for RooFit, but TMVA not only compiles sources with the; NVidia compiler but also uses the CUDA toolkit in regular C++. Therefore, that commit broke the TMVA GPU features. Unfortunately, I didn't notice before, because of this check; in `cmake/modules/SearchInstalledSoftware.cmake`:; ```cmake; if(tmva-gpu AND NOT CUDA_FOUND); set(tmva-gpu OFF CACHE BOOL ""Disabled because cuda not found"" FORCE); endif(); ```. The `CUDA_FOUND` variable is not set anymore now that `FindCUDA` is not; used. That means that `tmva-gpu` was silently disabled, and not building; successfully (which I had wrongly concluded because of the absence of; errors). This check needs to be replaced with; `if( NOT CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER)`. As recommended in the CMake docs, this should be done with the; `FindCUDAToolkit` module, which is what this PR suggests.

Modifiability,"This is a followup to commit 47c250898f3. The new algorithm to figure out the servers of a RooRealIntegral could get very expensive for large computation graphs, as seen with the ATLAS Higgs combinaiton. The problem was that there was a loop over an arguments clients for each argument in the computation graph. In this commit, loop is replaced by another loop over the computation graph in which one iterates only over the servers of the arguments that depend on the integration variables. I think this logic is even more intuitive to understand as well. I learned also that iterating over clients is never a good idea, because while the number of servers is well defined, there can be arbitrary many clients, making the performance very unpredictable.

The RooBatchCompute library had too many CUDA specific functions.

So an abstraction; didn't make much sense there. It's better to move the CUDA specifics; to a new `roofitcuda` library. Then, the functions from this library; are used in `batchcompute` and `roofitcore` behind preprocessor; macros when using CUDA. 2. Passing around `cudaStream_t` and `cudaEvent_t`. These types are only; available to `nvcc`, and in case gcc is used, these were forward; declared as stucts. This is a hack that should be avoided. In; particular, it can cause linker errors because the types are not the; same in the CUDA and C++ translation units. The proposed solution is to wrap the `cudaStream_t` and `cudaEvent_t`; pointers into C++ structs that are in the new CUDA support library,; and only when using `nvcc` it is allowed to unwrap these types. 3. Too specific signature of `RooAbsReal::computeBatch()`. This function; should not be too backend specific, but it took the `cudaStream_t`; directly. This parameter is removed.

If there is not `python` executable in `$PATH` at this time, that fails.

Modifiability,"This is two bugs, really: . 1) Inside the ""do while"" loop at line 243 of TTreeReaderArray.cxx, the ""parent"" string never changes which results in the loop never exiting.

(The change above in part 1 will not fix this.); For example: If my array is named something like: ""a.b.c[d.e.f]"" where ""a.b.c"" is the array name and ""d.e.f"" is the name of array length int, the logic in the loop will never find the correct leaf size. One could rewrite the logic such that every combination of characters in between "".""'s are tried, but this would be a bit complicated and cumbersome. Instead... Proposed change: Add an overloaded function call for TTreeReaderArray for the user to specify the array-length leaf name:; `TTreeReaderArray<float> myArr(treeReader, ""arrayLeafName"", ""arrayLengthLeafName"")`.

The error tells us that `falloc.h` has different file size on the build machine and; on the distribution machine.

Modifiability,This patch seems to be a good performance enhancement (skipping some work that will not be used) but I am confused on how it helps with the increase in autoloading as I would have expected that in the case where this patch is active (i.e. autoloading is disabled) the net effect would have been the same (i.e. autoloading not activated).

Modifiability,"This problem affects multi-range fits with `RooAbsPdf::fitTo` and was; reported in Jira issue [ROOT-9530](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-9530). Each RooNLLVar was created with the normalization set corresponding to; the subrange, not the union range like it should be. This commit adds an; extra term to the final likelihood function to cancel this normalization; problem. The extra term doesn't have to be added for the extended fit, because; adding extension terms for the likelihoods in each range as currently; done is mathematically equivalent to applying the normalization correction term; plus adding a global extension term. I'm not sure if I should call this a bug or not. On the one hand, the result that was computed previously was not wrong, it just didn't use all the information (relative number of events in each subrange was not considered). On the other hand, the result was not the best possible estimate given the information in all sub-ranges, and users expects the maximum likelihood estimate to be the best estimate available given the information. There is also a [PDF document](https://github.com/root-project/root/files/6245069/Multi_range_likelihood_fits_in_RooFit.pdf) that explains the math behind this pull request, in particular why the normalization correction doesn't have to be applied for the extended fit.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7719:431,extend,extended,431,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7719,2,['extend'],['extended']

Modifiability,"This proposed new Strategy in minuit2 is the same migrad behaviour as Strategy=2 but with the following changes to the Hesse calculation:; * The step and g2 tolerances have been zeroed so that the 7 cycles are forced in the diagonal-term calculation. This was found to be necessary in cases where asimov datasets were used for the minimization and there were very few iterations for the approximate covariance to be determined from. ; * Central finite difference is used for mixed partial derivatives. This requires 3 extra function evaluations per derivative, but is necessary in the case of minima where there is high curvature (in the case of high stats) and the forward finite difference (default) behaviour leads incorrectly to a non-positive-definite covariance matrix; * Return the uncorrected covariance matrix, even if it is not positive definite. This useful for checking just how far from positive-definiteness the matrix is by being able to examine the eigenvalues. . Additionally, a lower bound on the precision allowed for the spread of eigenvalues of the ""hessian"" correlation matrix (computing a correlation matrix with the hessian as if it was a covariance matrix) was reduced from 1e-6 to 1e-12 (see MnHesse.cxx) ... it is not clear why 1e-6 was the lower bound previously, but current machine precision can beat that (I get locally 1e-8). I left a comment about whether this lower bound should be made configurable or not... This new strategy was tested with a model with high statistics (almost 50 million events) where the migrad minimization was successful but the hessian was being forced positive definite. With this new Strategy 3 the hessian is accurate and positive definite in all cases tested.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13109:1421,config,configurable,1421,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13109,1,['config'],['configurable']

Vc is used by VecCore, and since it is not relocatable, it must be built by the VecCore build system in order to avoid the situation in which VecCore finds a broken temporary installed version of Vc in ROOT's `${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}`. It is perfectly fine to use a builtin VecCore with an externally installed Vc, however. Ideally, though, both should be externally installed. When both are enabled as builtins, they will get installed at the end along with ROOT into the final prefix, with correct configurations. I can not test the build on ARM, please let me know if Jenkins shows any failures. @xvallspl Since you have been using VecCore within ROOT, could you please try this branch out?

A test has been added to check that this renders usable `RTupleField`s in all CI configurations, even when padding is added (see `char` members). ; **EDIT:** most implementations including libstdc++ (gcc), libc++ (llvm), and MSVC name members as `_0`, `_1`, ..., `_N-1`, following the order of the type list.; Use TClass to get their offsets; in case a particular `std::tuple` implementation does not define such members, an assertion will fail.; This fixes the issue of libc++ using a different member ordering w.r.t. other STL implementations (see failing test below).; - Update `specifications.md` accordingly. ## Checklist:; - [X] tested changes locally; - [X] updated the docs (if necessary).

Modifiability,"This pull request adds support for the LZ4 compression algorithm (https://code.google.com/p/lz4/). The code is BSD-licensed. The pull-request includes a source tarball (allowing a ""builtin_lz4"" option in CMake analogous to ""builtin_lzma""). I am unable to test this on Windows currently. The LZ4 algorithm focuses on decompression speed while sacrificing compression ratio. Compression level < 4 uses the ""LZ4 compression"" algorithm while compression level >= 4 uses ""LZ4HC"" (HC = high compression) variant. LZ4HC is comparable to zlib in speeds, but has approximately 20% larger file size. To evaluate, I use the Event executable in the test/ directory. I extend this to allow the compression algorithm be specified via CLI. Example invocation:. time ./Event 4000 6 99 1 1000 4; time ./Event 4000 4 99 0 1000 4. Here, the CLI arguments are:; - 1: Number of events (4000); - 2: Compression ratio (6); - 3: Split level (99); - 4: 1 for write, 0 for read.; - 5: Number of tracks per event (1000).; - 6: Compression algorithm (1 = zlib, 2 = lzma, 4 = lz4. 3 is the deprecated zlib-like algorithm).

Modifiability,"This pull request extends `RPageSink` to allow for vector commit of sealed pages.

These changes enable (parallel) vector writes in concrete backends, e.g. in DAOS. Derived classes that do not override the base implementation will see a sequence of calls to `CommitSealedPage()`. The first measurements of vector writes on DAOS based on this PR, indicate an improvement of _an order of magnitude_ in the write throughput. The refactor in this PR passes all the RPageSinkBuf tests. ## Changes or fixes:; - Add `CommitSealedPageV()` to the public interface of `RPageSink`. This function carries out a vector write of a number of sealed page ranges. Each range applies to a given columnId.; The default implementation of `CommitSealedPageVImpl()` sequentially calls `CommitSealedPageImpl()` for each page on each range, but derived classes can override it to provide an optimized implementation.; - Use `CommitSealedPageV()` in RPageSinkBuf. If a buffered column contains only sealed pages, commit the whole range; via `CommitSealedPageV()`.; - If all buffered columns consist solely of sealed pages, coalesce all pages to be committed in a single `CommitSealedPageV()` call that includes a sealed page range per column. ## Checklist:; - [X] tested changes locally; - [X] updated the docs (if necessary).

Modifiability,"This pull request implements the foundations for late model extension, i.e. extending the ntuple model with new fields after the initial schema has been fixed.; Per this PR, we only allow extending the model before the first entry is filled. This restriction will be removed in a follow-up PR. **NOTE:** after the changes in this PR, all the currently existing ntuple files remain readable. The user-facing API is based on a new class `RNTupleModel::RUpdater` that can be used as follows:; ```c++; auto model = RNTupleModel::Create();; auto field1 = model->MakeField<float>(""field1"", 42.0);. auto ntuple = RNTupleWriter::Recreate(std::move(model), ""myNTuple"", ""some/file.root"");; auto modelUpdater = ntuple->CreateModelUpdater();; modelUpdater->BeginUpdate();; float field2 = 10.0;; modelUpdater->AddField<float>(""field2"", &field2);; modelUpdater->CommitUpdate();; // possibly more calls to `BeginUpdate()`/`CommitUpdate()` here... *field2 = 42.0;; ntuple->Fill();; ```. ## Changes or fixes:; - Changes required to `RNTupleDescriptor`: in particular, _(i)_ `RNTupleDescriptorBuilder::BeginHeaderExtension()` marks the beginning of the header extension; and _(ii)_ extension header information, including an iterator over the top-level fields may be obtained via `RNTupleDescriptor::GetHeaderExtension()`.; - Serialize/deserialize an incremental schema description, i.e. schema extension, as part of the footer envelope.

Modifiability,"This pull request introduces ntuple management at the DAOS container level, extending support for more than one ntuple to populate a container. ## Changes or fixes:; - Support for up to 2\^32 - 1 ntuples in a DAOS container, by assigning an index to a previously-unused portion of the DAOS Object ID address space. The index thus induces a subspace dedicated for all objects belonging to a given ntuple. The zeroth space (index `0`) is reserved for any container-wide metadata objects that may need to be stored in the future.; - `ROOT::Experimental::Detail::RDaosContainerNTupleLocator` is a structure that concentrates the functionality for locating and retrieving stored metadata from an ntuple by its name.; - The structure hashes the name into a well-distributed 32-bit index. Collisions are expressly forbidden to simplify implementation; a different ntuple name must be provided to the sink upon creation if an ntuple stored in the container with another name happens to have the same hash (index).; - The sink (in `RPageSinkDaos` ctor) uses the locator to assign an index for a new ntuple, which may fail if the name's resulting hash collides with some other ntuple present unless the name matches. Overwriting (""recreating"") an existing ntuple is allowed in this context.; - The source (in `RPageSourceDaos::AttachImpl()`) locates the ntuple by the name to validate that it is indeed present in storage (otherwise, an exception is thrown). The objects that are read for this validation are reused as part of the ntuple metadata deserialization procedure when attaching. ; - Unit test coverage is provided for the following cases: write and read from different ntuples in a container; and attempt to open an ntuple that was not stored there. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally + cluster on single client with libdaos 2.2.0; - [x] updated the docs (if necessary).

Modifiability,"This somewhat huge commit mainly demotes many class-versions to 0. . If wanted, I can for sure squash some things (right now, the commit messages contain the underlying reasoning). . In ROOT, a lot of classes were equipped with class-versions > 0 even though they are not meant for IO / streaming. ; This produces unnecessary overhead (creation of Streamer() functions) and might be misleading for users (especially if they believe streaming of these classes would be ok and then lose parts of their data). That's even more helpful when testing framework's dataobject-code. . These classes were identified by https://github.com/olifre/rootStaticAnalyzer (a new project still in early stages) and I have created this PR to fix almost all these issues. . The last commit in the series also explicitly marks two members (of TSeqCollection and THashList) as transient, even though these classes are already class-version 0. This is purely to make it more explicit that these are not streamed - and allow for programmatic testing (since then the `kTransient` bit of the `TRealData` will be set correctly). . Several issues alerted by `rootStaticAnalyzer` still remain which are probably real bugs in ROOT 6. . Examples: . ```; TMVA/PDF.h:0: error: Data object class 'TMVA::PDF' will not stream the following indirect members: members 'fConfigName, fConfigDescription, fReferenceFile' from class 'TMVA::Configurable' (class-version 0)!; ```. It seems like `TMVA::PDF` is meant for streaming, but inherits from a base which is not. . Similar to that:. ```; include/TTreeResult.h:0: error: Data object class 'TTreeResult' will not stream the following indirect members: members 'fRowCount' from class 'TSQLResult' (class-version 0)!; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/169:1397,Config,Configurable,1397,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/169,2,"['Config', 'inherit']","['Configurable', 'inherits']"

Modifiability,"Those 2 classes may or may not be the only 2 that have this kind of pattern in the wild, so it might be interesting to solve the underlying issue which is likely to be that `BindCppObject` is trying to bind to a type which has no interpreter info. So a fix could be to have either `CPyCppyy::BindCppObject` or `Cppyy::GetActualClass` to check for the presence of interpreter info before attempting to automatically bind to the ""actual class/type"". (In theory this should be done by testing `TClass::HasInterpreterInfo` but in this case it is returning an incorrect information and thus we have to use `TClass::GetClassInfo`). The change in behavior is that after this modification, `PyROOT/Cppyy` would no longer warn if the actual return type is inadvertently missing its interpreter info. However semantically this seems to be the right behavior, for example in our cases we would:; * have no warning; * PyROOT will report the type of the pointer as `TList`; * Usage of the meta routines (`IsA` and co.) would still give accurate information (access to the `TClass` for `TViewPubFunctions`); * Interfaces to the objects are the same as the one available from the equivalent C++ code (I.e. `TList`) (unless the user does an explicit dynamic_cast to the underlying type). * In other cases (for user provided functions and classes) where the interpreter information from the underlying class is missing by mistake (bad/broken configuration of the user code/libraries), the error/warning reporting about the missing interpreter info will be delayed until the user actually want to access the underlying class.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16177#issuecomment-2271797820:1425,config,configuration,1425,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16177#issuecomment-2271797820,1,['config'],['configuration']

If we pick up all possible modulemaps on the include paths we have less control and rootcling goes in the opposite direction -- to be able to control much better the environment in which it works (in a previous PRs we have limited the set of flags it can take). As a side effect of this it will fix the module redefinition errors seen in the LCG builds and when ROOT is installed. IIUC the comments are reasonable and suggesting to move away from the ROOT static configuration for the essential directories such as the etcdir, libdir, incdir and so on. IMO, this not part of the PR even though it touches these functions. I support fixing these issues, however, if we want to fix them we will have to write quite a bit of utility functions which already exist in libLLVMSupport. A potential way forward (outside of this PR) is to make libLLVMSupport available to FoundationUtils and then we can use getMainExecutable and so on to make ROOT detect its essential folders at runtime.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4553#issuecomment-543193289:687,config,configuration,687,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4553#issuecomment-543193289,1,['config'],['configuration']

Modifiability,"Today, I discovered that `ROOT::TestSupport` does not always work as intended: Consider a ROOT7 build without IMT, and the unit tests `tree/ntuple/v7/test/ntuple_extended` and `tree/ntuple/v7/test/ntuple_storage`. Both call `ROOT::EnableImplicitMT()` which results in a warning (this should be fixed separately). `TestSupport.cxx` has a `ForbidDiagnostics noDiagCheckerInstance` that should call `SetErrorHandler` and fail the test if there is an unexpected diagnostic. It turns out this works fine for `ntuple_extended` (which is currently failing in configurations without IMT), but not for `ntuple_storage`. The reason seems to be that `ntuple_storage` doesn't use any other code from `ROOT::TestSupport`, and because it's a static library (since https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9528) the linker can just skip it. (This was different for the object library before, there you link in the individual object files.). I'm not sure what the best solution is: Is it possible and reasonable to install object libraries? If not, an ugly approach is to emit an undefined symbol from `TestSupport.hxx` that will force the linker to add the static library...",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12828:552,config,configurations,552,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12828,1,['config'],['configurations']

Modifiability,"Unfortunately, coming back to this, I'm not sure this change (in its final form) is sufficient: The comment in `~RPageStorage` says that tasks may hold a reference to `this`, which is an instance of a derived subclass (as `RPageStorage` is abstract; and so are `RPageSink` and `RPageSource`). However, once control flow makes it to `~RPageStorage`, the subclass has already been destructed, including its member fields (if my recollection of C++ destructor chains in the presence of inheritance serves well), so we have a race with any task that may try to access one of them. As a concrete case, the summary mentions `RPageSinkBuf::CommitPageImpl()` where the tasks access `fBufferedColumns`. If one of the tasks is only started after `~RPageStorage` calls `WaitForAllTasks`, it will read from an already destructed `std::vector`, which would explain one of the failure modes I still see in CI runs.

So there was this difference between the single threaded Snapshot that still used the weird ChangeFile behaviour (although it shouldn't have triggered a segfault anyway since it's using a plain TFile), and the multithreaded Snapshot that got its behaviour changed to avoid the issue. Considering both types of failures, and the fact that a coherent behaviour across the two Snapshot modes is desirable, I would refactor the usage of `TTree::SetMaxTreeSize` inside of RDF Snapshot in a single common point that both single-thread and multi-thread operations have to go through, if that exists. Or in alternative, the workaround should be done at construction time of both helpers and then removed at destruction time (or in `Initialize` and `Finalize` methods).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6570#issuecomment-720955137:1016,refactor,refactor,1016,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6570#issuecomment-720955137,1,['refactor'],['refactor']

The class was also only used by the RooFit Multiprocess developers so far, so changing the interface is fine.

Modifiability,"What can be done here is rather simple. The bottleneck last time I checked is rootcling (dictionary generation). There are two reasons:; * cmake -- dictionary generation depends on LinkDef and header files and both artifacts are available from the beginning. However, the cmake build system does not have separate targets for dictionary generation and library generation. That leads to forcing rootcling to wait for the expensive linking step of each library. For example, instead of building `Y.pcm` once we are done with building `X.pcm` we wait for the linker to link `X.so`.; * rootcling is unnecessary slow -- the tool has grown organically and in many cases we make many iterations over the AST where we don't need them. Some of the larger scale ideas have been outlined here since years: https://github.com/root-project/root-evolution/pull/5 In fact, we don't need to get so much into the refactoring rootcling, attaching a profiler and seeing the bottlenecks should be easy.

Commit 5 is again a minor refactoring to reduce some duplicated code.; 6. Commit 6 adds a strong warning message when fits end after only having tried parameters that give evaluation errors. In such a case, there will not actually be any valid value, but rather the error handling code will return zero as the function value. Minuit sees this as a valid function value and thinks the function converged and so RooFit would also think everything ended well. With this commit, at least a warning is issued. Perhaps this response should be stronger or weaker, that is up for discussion.; 7. Commit 7 applies a recommendation from the Form documentation to replace it with Format.; 8.

The first 3 integrals are correct, but the final one (custom range for x and slice of y) gives the wrong result (0.493 expected).

Modifiability,"You are adding it to the target, the dependency is explicit in the fact that you need to have a target to pass as argument. You don't need to add the include that the dictionary needs to the executable, you could just add it to the directory includes, but adding to the target is better as it avoids leaking it to subdirectories. You only have to do it before because of Axel's changes that force a manual header search for the dictionary header, so the search paths need to be ready for you to actually find it. In earlier versions of ROOT, not finding this header would not cause a failure, but may have picked up the wrong header and injected a bunch of absolute paths to the dictionary which in turn would end up breaking things. For example, if you know the dictionary header will always just be in the current source directory, you could just set `CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR` to `True` instead, and not add the current directory to the target includes.; ```; $ cmake --help-variable CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR; CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR; -------------------------.

Modifiability,"You convinced me that the subevent-section tests should be `EXPECT_DOUBLE_EQ`. > From what I can see, this is only working by chance right now. You are right! This can easily be confirmed (even just on my x86 laptop) by changing the seed on line 66. Setting it to some other values, the `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.EventSections` fails sometimes (e.g. seed = 24) and `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.SubEventSections` as well (e.g. seed = 255). Some seeds even make multiple tests fail, e.g. 25534 fails `BinnedDatasetTest.EventSections` and `SimBinnedConstrainedTest.EventSections` and 2 makes both `SimBinnedConstrainedTest` event-splitting tests fail. I was not able to find a seed that fails the other tests, so it seems to be contained to the `*EventSections` tests. To be complete, I think we should add the explanation of why this comparison doesn't work, which is that **the calculations are**, in fact, **different**. We're comparing a single-section (""all events"") calculation to multi-section (""events section 1"" + ""section 2"" + ...). Obviously, this can give differences due to rounding from FMA or just Kahan summation which also has a small error sometimes. In other tests in the `RooAbsL` and other `RooFit::TestStatistics` suite, this doesn't typically apply. In most of the tests, we're trying to do the exact same calculation (""same"" in terms of CPU operations as well), except either in parallel or through the `TestStatistics` classes instead of the old `RooNLLVar` tree. Sometimes different ordering can change results, like the extended term you mentioned, but also the subsidiary term. Anyway, for this PR: I will suggest an explanation comment and after that it can be merged (@guitargeek agrees, we discussed it in the RooFit dev meeting just now). I will also open an issue reminding us to also apply this change to the two `EventSections` tests.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12389#issuecomment-1550987204:1541,extend,extended,1541,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12389#issuecomment-1550987204,1,['extend'],['extended']
