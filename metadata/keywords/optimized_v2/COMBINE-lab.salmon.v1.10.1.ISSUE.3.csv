Integrability,"e I answer your question and layout my logic, I want to mention that I am **_not_** suggesting fastp is not doing its job, **_neither am I stating that fastp is working incorrectly_**. Now to my answer(s) and logic:; 1. With fastp, I am not sure if adapter trimming happens first and then quality trimming OR vice-versa. I could not find info on this from their README and **_I could be wrong here with my next line_** - [Based on Figure 1 of this paper, it looks to me as though quality trimming is done before adapter trimming](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6129281/figure/bty560-F1/). - [To quote Brian Bushnell (author of BBTools)]( http://seqanswers.com/forums/showpost.php?p=140819&postcount=5), . > It's best to do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming, because if you do quality-trimming first, sometimes adapters will be partially trimmed and become too short to be recognized as adapter sequence. When you run BBDuk with both quality-trimming and adapter-trimming in the same run, it will do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming. 2. I very well know that the advantage of using fastp is that it can do adapter trimming, etc in a automatic fashion - no need to provide external sequences (example adapter sequences). Yes, I know one can also provide a fasta file of adapters and fatsp will work off it. There are many fatsp issues in GH about adapter detection:. - fail to detect adpaters automatically - (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/222 and https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/205). - [incorrect automatic adapter detection](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/240). - [inconsistent behavior with different runs](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/231). 3. When I see the above, I am bit skeptical using fastp for qc/adapter trimming. . After lot of trials with bbduk and fastp, I have decided to use bbduk and bbmap for my high throughput analysis. Below, I explain my reasoning behind those choices: . **_```Note - edited this ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/485#issuecomment-597393209:997,adapter,adapter-trimming,997,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/485#issuecomment-597393209,4,['adapter'],['adapter-trimming']

Big Picture - DEG identification for samples sequenced by ILMN (whole transcript method) and QS (3' method) - [something similar to this paper](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-018-5393-3).

I used UpSetR plots for comparisons of sets of DEGs from each method just [as you have shown in your recent preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v1.full). In the ILMN analyses, there is great concordance between the SAF method and HISAT/STAR_RSEM method. However, in the QS analyses, there is very limited concordance between SAF and the HISAT/STAR_RSEM method. For QS analyses, the TXOME method shows great concordance with HISAT/STAR_RSEM. This finding made me wonder if this has to be something with my salmon quant command line options for QS.

Integrability,"e relative tradeoffs and merits of different alignment approaches). * Salmon and RSEM use related but distinct optimization algorithms by default. RSEM uses the EM algorithm, and salmon uses the variational Bayesian EM algorithm. The latter tends to induce more sparse solutions. This is simply because they are optimizing slightly different objectives. It is very difficult to say in general if one is ""better"" than the other in a blanket way, but [there is previous literature to support that the VBEM may be more accurate](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/29/18/2292/239795). However, while RSEM only implements the EM algorithm, salmon actually implements and provides a switch to use either. So, if you want to test the effect of this difference, you can run salmon with the `--useEM` algorithm. This will tell salmon to use the ""classic"" EM algorithm and will eliminate this source of variation. * As with the other question you asked, there may be a _small_ discrepancy depending on when enforcement of a stranded library kicks in under salmon's `A` library type. You can eliminate that variable by simply providing `-l SF` to match the library type being used with RSEM. * Coming back to the `IndelSoftclipSingleend` parameter I mentioned in the first point; RSEM disallows indels in the alignments that it quantifies. This means that to produce RSEM-compatible input, STAR must not align reads that contain indels. While this won't generally have a big effect for many transcripts, it can certainly affect the abundance estimates for transcripts in your sample where the sample you are quantifying has (indel) variation with respect to the reference annotation. We touch upon that a bit as well in the [paper I mentioned above](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02151-8). * Finally, and likely the smallest source of potential differences, is that there are other implementation details that differ between salmon and RSEM (e.g. exactly how th",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/612#issuecomment-758004590:3543,depend,depending,3543,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/612#issuecomment-758004590,2,['depend'],['depending']
Integrability,"e""). For the pipeline I'm building it would be ideal if I didn't have to specify the strandedness of the library as I'm not the one preparing the samples and it's not always easy to get that information from the scientist in the lab. As such, it would be great if I can use the default strandedness argument to STAR (""Unstranded"") and let salmon ""do the right thing"" by letting it choose the libType for me. With that in mind, if I let salmon choose for me (-l A) am I risking throwing out any data?. Right, so in this case, STAR should produce all highest-scoring valid alignments regardless of orientation. Then, when running salmon with `-l A` it will detect the strandedness and only discard alignments compatible with the appropriate strand type (which may be unstranded if that is the protocol). Salmon is pretty conservative about reporting when there is any ambiguity. By default, if the strand bias is stronger than a few percent. In a stranded protocol, it will report and if it infers more than a few percent of fragments no having a valid alignment. So you can always double-check samples where the strandedness is at all ambiguous. > In addition, if a transcript was aligned in a unstranded manner and ended up aligning to the wrong location due to ambiguity between the positive orientation of one transcript and the negative orientation of another, can salmon correct this by reassigning it to the right transcript based on the joint probability of all the other alignments (if you can't tell I'm at the edge of my BS zone)?. If there is not an alignment to the correct location _in addition to_ the wrong location, then no. If you run salmon in alignment mode, it will assign each fragment probabilistically to the set of transcripts to which it aligns. There is, by definition, a probability of 0 for a fragment being assigned to a location where it doesn't align. That is, the reported alignment positions should contain the true alignment.

Integrability,"eads.fq > aln.sam`. This approach seems to employ a splicing aware algorithm against a genomic reference, using canonical splicing signals to help map the transcripts. However, this method doesn't seem to be applicable to Salmon given the requirement that the reads are aligned directly to the transcriptome (hence the need to account for splicing with '_-ac splice_' is lost). An alternative approach I've seen (i.e., the one used in ONT's own DGE [pipeline](https://github.com/nanoporetech/pipeline-transcriptome-de)) is to use minimap2 to align to the transcriptome reference but to retain a large number of secondary mappings (-N 100 in minimap2):. `minimap2 -ax map-ont -N 100 transcriptome.fa reads.fq`. This makes more sense in terms of the _-ax_ preset used, but I guess I'm just wondering then what the optimal input for Salmon would be in order to get the most accurate count data? I know secondary mappings are important for the algorithm to calculate uncertainty / maximum likelihood, but is there an recommend number of these to retain? The logic behind allowing for a high number of secondary alignments when using a transcriptome reference is to account for the high similarity among isoforms. From a high-level view I could see how this might be problematic though, depending on how Salmon actually uses the alternate mappings (i.e., is it just for the statistics or does it affect the counts as well?). . I've also seen groups toying with adjusting the _-p_ setting in minimap2 which sets the minimal ratio of the secondary to primary alignment score that is allowed in order to report the secondary mapping. Surveying the forums and discussion boards, values of _-N_ ranging from the default of 5 to 100 and of _-p_ ranging from 0 to 1, (i.e., anything) seem to be acceptable.

Integrability,"estion related to a strange message in the log out file after Salmon indexing on a very small genome with my own generated transcriptome and decoy. I'm running Salmon v1.0.0 index on the transcriptome of Candida parapsilosis which has a small genome of 26mbp. I created the transcriptome using Cufflinks gffread on my reference genome fasta and gff3. I created the decoy by concatenating the whole genome to the transcriptome [as it was described in the manual](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html#preparing-transcriptome-indices-mapping-based-mode). . I am running using the following options:. `salmon index -t gentrome.fa.gz -d decoys.txt -p 12 -i cpar_salmon_index -k 31; `. After indexing using a kmer size threshold of -k 31, I see the following message in the log out file ""filter size not provided. ntHll estimated 12754610 distinct k-mers, setting filter size to 2^28."" . 2^28 seems very high compared to 31 bp set using -k 31.

Integrability,"expression matrices with high sequencing depth depending on amount of mapped reads, if I understand well. >Use Alevin w/o any modification to the fastq on both of your sample to generate the gene count matrices. I already did that, in downstream analyses I have a batch effect issue related to the sequencing depth. >that's why we recommend using the Seurat package downstream of the Alevin quantified matrices. I have some experience with downstream analyses with Seurat, Pagoda, Scater, scanpy and a few other tools, and I am aware of batch correction methods like CCA or MNN. But that is not what I am looking for here. I did both CCA and MNN but I loose some important information in the resulting eigenspaces or corrected matrix. I believe the proper way to correct my batch effect is to simply fix the difference between my two libraries, ie. the sequencing depth in this case. As I explained in my first message, cellranger aggregate (subsampling based on the amount of mapped reads) works very well in my case, correct the effect without any loss or modification of important genes in our scientific question. Not CCA or MNN. I would like to be able to do the same from the alevin quantifications. So I am looking for a proper way to apply a correction before/during/after the alevin quantification, in a way similar to what cellranger do with STAR. Alternatively, could a subsampling covariate be added to the probalistic quantification model of alevin (if I understand it well), in sort that such a discrepency bewteen samples would be corrected?. I did look at the mappedUMI file:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34892073/47551835-85ef9380-d903-11e8-893f-2a684576437b.png).

Integrability,"have a public 10xV2 sample that I am reprocessing ([SRR13313130](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR13313130)). More specifically, I believe that the sample should be **10X Genomics 5' v1**. I am using the following command:. ```; ID=5309-CT-2; R1=../Reads/5309-CT-2_S01_L005_R1_001.fastq.gz; R2=../Reads/5309-CT-2_S01_L005_R2_001.fastq.gz.

If I use the V3 barcode list, then I _don't_ get an error message. However, I got more discordant cell counts between CellRanger and STARsolo. The Kallisto cell barcode recovery rate was also low (<10%). So, I thought there error was that different cell barcodes should be used for this sample. I think that matches, what I saw on this FAQ page from 10x Genomics:. https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004506263-What-is-a-barcode-whitelist-. So, I downloaded the [737k-august-2016.txt](https://github.com/10XGenomics/cellranger/blob/master/lib/python/cellranger/barcodes/737K-august-2016.txt) file from 10x, and I am testing using that.

Integrability,"he premature sequences on the minus strand as I had to do for the mature sequences. Yet, I did that anyway. I initially did test my protocol to ensure it produced identical transcript sequences to Gencode, but I only did this for mature sequences. All seemed fine for both + and - strand transcripts. After your feedback, I compared the premature sequences in my transcript fasta against the transcript fasta from Gencode. As you can see in the smoothed dot plots below, the premature sequences of transcripts on the minus strand are in the wrong orientation and have the wrong complementarity!. ![Screenshot from 2021-04-24 00-35-05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10429333/115947355-0d96c880-a495-11eb-92a6-d8d2233c8d2b.png). I included my R code below for this test case for anyone who might stumble upon this issue. Under the code headers “Mature transcript sequences” and “Premature transcript sequences”, you can observe that I used identical protocols for sequence subsetting, yet in the mature case the strand information in the GRanges seems to be disregarded when subsetting from Biostrings, but in the premature case the strand information is used. Of course, this problem is out of the scope of this forum so it will be okay to close this issue. I will reach out to the developers of GenomicRanges and Biostrings to point out this potential problem and seek their guidance. Thank you again for all your help.

Integrability,"ing incorrectly_**. Now to my answer(s) and logic:; 1. With fastp, I am not sure if adapter trimming happens first and then quality trimming OR vice-versa. I could not find info on this from their README and **_I could be wrong here with my next line_** - [Based on Figure 1 of this paper, it looks to me as though quality trimming is done before adapter trimming](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6129281/figure/bty560-F1/). - [To quote Brian Bushnell (author of BBTools)]( http://seqanswers.com/forums/showpost.php?p=140819&postcount=5), . > It's best to do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming, because if you do quality-trimming first, sometimes adapters will be partially trimmed and become too short to be recognized as adapter sequence. When you run BBDuk with both quality-trimming and adapter-trimming in the same run, it will do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming. 2. I very well know that the advantage of using fastp is that it can do adapter trimming, etc in a automatic fashion - no need to provide external sequences (example adapter sequences). Yes, I know one can also provide a fasta file of adapters and fatsp will work off it. There are many fatsp issues in GH about adapter detection:. - fail to detect adpaters automatically - (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/222 and https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/205). - [incorrect automatic adapter detection](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/240). - [inconsistent behavior with different runs](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/231). 3. When I see the above, I am bit skeptical using fastp for qc/adapter trimming. . After lot of trials with bbduk and fastp, I have decided to use bbduk and bbmap for my high throughput analysis. Below, I explain my reasoning behind those choices: . **_```Note - edited this on 02-Apr-2020 to have the correct order of operations ```_** . 1. **_STEP 1 - run bbmap.sh on raw fatsq file to remove contaminants as appropriate (rRNA, mitochondri",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/485#issuecomment-597393209:1161,adapter,adapter,1161,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/485#issuecomment-597393209,4,['adapter'],['adapter']

Integrability,"inly does seem very low. To answer your specific questions first:; 1) I'm not sure --- let's try tor find out; 2) I don't think so (if they are part of your index, they should be aligned against); 3) If there are many transcripts / targets you expect to be sequenced but which aren't present in this set, that can affect the mapping rate, but not likely to take it down to 6%. Here are the things I'd investigate --- roughly in order: . 1) In addition to the fraction of reads STAR mapped (which you report above), what fraction of the reads are assigned to features by featureCounts? In some cases, when there is a failure of rRNA depletion of polyA selection, you can end up with an experiment where most of the sequenced RNA comes from rRNA not present in the reference transcriptome. In this case, STAR will be able to align the reads to the genome, but you won't see these reads mapping to annotated features (and you also won't see them showing up in your transcript level quantifications). So, it may be worth to take a look at the count of reads assigned to the feature set of genes by featureCounts. 2) Above, it looks like a considerable number of fragments were discarded due to no alignment reaching the required alignment score (`11,448,458` fragments discarded because of this). Have you tried to adapter / quality trim the data? Does this have any effect on the mapping rate?. 3) If the above don't reveal any clues, I'd be happy to try to take a look at the data if you can share it. I'd be quite surprised if STAR is aligning a lot of reads *to transcriptome features* that are being missed by salmon. Nonetheless, if you pass the proper flags to STAR (including `--quantMode TranscriptomeSAM`), then you can use the SAM/BAM file generated by STAR to perform quantification with salmon (i.e. use STAR's alignments to do _transcript-level_ quantification). I'd be happy to help dig further on any of these, so please feel free to reach out if you find anything interesting.

Integrability,"mming OR vice-versa. I could not find info on this from their README and **_I could be wrong here with my next line_** - [Based on Figure 1 of this paper, it looks to me as though quality trimming is done before adapter trimming](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6129281/figure/bty560-F1/). - [To quote Brian Bushnell (author of BBTools)]( http://seqanswers.com/forums/showpost.php?p=140819&postcount=5), . > It's best to do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming, because if you do quality-trimming first, sometimes adapters will be partially trimmed and become too short to be recognized as adapter sequence. When you run BBDuk with both quality-trimming and adapter-trimming in the same run, it will do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming. 2. I very well know that the advantage of using fastp is that it can do adapter trimming, etc in a automatic fashion - no need to provide external sequences (example adapter sequences). Yes, I know one can also provide a fasta file of adapters and fatsp will work off it. There are many fatsp issues in GH about adapter detection:. - fail to detect adpaters automatically - (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/222 and https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/205). - [incorrect automatic adapter detection](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/240). - [inconsistent behavior with different runs](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/231). 3. When I see the above, I am bit skeptical using fastp for qc/adapter trimming. . After lot of trials with bbduk and fastp, I have decided to use bbduk and bbmap for my high throughput analysis. Below, I explain my reasoning behind those choices: . **_```Note - edited this on 02-Apr-2020 to have the correct order of operations ```_** . 1. **_STEP 1 - run bbmap.sh on raw fatsq file to remove contaminants as appropriate (rRNA, mitochondrial, chloroplast)_**; - You have alluded to the importance of removing contaminants [in this post](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/485#issuecomment-597393209:1324,adapter,adapters,1324,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/485#issuecomment-597393209,2,['adapter'],['adapters']

Integrability,"nerates the compacted colored de Bruijn graph from the input sequence is based on a very elegant algorithm that couples a Bloom filter with an exact hash table, and makes two (or more) passes over the input to identify all of the junctions in the reference (which directly implies all unitigs). To make the algorithm work efficiently, one needs to have an estimate for the number of distinct k-mers that will be encountered in the reference sequence. If the estimate is too big, one wastes memory. If the estimate is too small, the Bloom filter is not big enough, it doesn't filter efficiently, and the algorithm ends up putting way too much data in the exact hash table. In order to determine how to set the Bloom filter size appropriately, we take the following approach. If the Bloom filter size isn't provided directly (_note_: this is _not_ the same as the k-mer size, this is an estimate of the total number of distinct k-mers in the entire input data), then we make a call to a function defined in the [ntCard](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntCard) library. This is a program designed specifically for cardinality estimation of k-mers in sequencing data. Based on the estimated number of distinct k-mers, we use the standard equations (derived from the theory behind Bloom filters) to set the Bloom filter to be of the smallest possible size that still achieves a relatively low, pre-specified, false positive rate. The message you are seeing is that the estimates suggest the Bloom filter should be of size 2^28 *bits*, which is ~ 33.55MB — pretty small, actually. This is because ntCard estimated 12,754,610 distinct k-mers (31-mers) in your input dataset, which doesn't seem unreasonable. In short, I think the output you observe here seems completely reasonable and in line with the data you are providing. However, I understand how all of this output might to make sense if you're not familiar with everything going on behind the scenes.

Integrability,"nt algorithms like Bowtie2 and BWA-MEM with respect to both sensitivity and specificity. Here, you are likely seeing a manifestation of the former. Specifically, greedy behavior can lead to spurious matches. Many of these spurious matches are filtered out when applying a consensus mechanism to the series of matches produced by a read; however, this can result in the read going unmapped. We have noticed this behavior where spurious matches can ""mask"" better overall mappings, and we have developed an algorithm to overcome these limitations (called selective-alignment). This is currently implemented in [this branch](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/rescue-orphan) of the Salmon repo (if you want to test it out and have trouble building, we can build you a linux executable). This algorithm explores more potential mappings and then applies a fast algorithm for filtering potentially poor ones. In our benchmarks, it exhibits sensitivity and specificity very close to Bowtie2 (which is among the best of the alignment-based methods we considered). Also, I will note that, though the speed and statistical optimization procedures used in fast transcript abundance estimation tools make them a potentially desirable choice for microbiomic / metagenomic abundance estimation, their indices are typically optimized for speed and not size. For small numbers of bacterial species this can be okay, but if one wishes to index large collections of species, the memory usage can become a problem. To this end, we have developed a new indexing scheme (software [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish), slightly out-of-date pre-print [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/21/191874)). That code already implements a tool for taxonomic read assignment (a la the excellent [Kraken](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken)), but not yet abundance estimation (that is coming soon). So, depending on how much you want to scale up, you might want to keep an eye on that as well.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/196#issuecomment-365337297:2237,depend,depending,2237,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/196#issuecomment-365337297,1,['depend'],['depending']

The difference is that every fragment can have many potential mappings. The number you are looking at is the total number of attempted alignments that failed to achieve the threshold score. Luckily, salmon reports both numbers. The number of fragments for which all alignments failed to reach the score threshold is 4,196,417; given in aux_info.json by ""num_fragments_filtered_vm"": 4196417. One point to note is that these are all fragments for which mapping is attempted (they had at least one k-mer match the reference), but no alignment was valid up to the threshold. You could try running the quantification again with --softclip to allow softclipping of the reads and see if any considerable fraction of these 4196417 failed to align because they overhang the annotated transcripts or contain adapters etc. Nonetheless, even if all of these mapped, the rate would still be ~72%. The remainder of the reads didn't even have a matching k-mer in common with the reference transcriptome, which means they are exceedingly unlikely to have come from the transcripts that were indexed. Further explanation of what these metadata numbers mean would be very helpful to me. Also useful would be a statistic (or more than one statistic) that fully categorises the read alignments or non-alignments. **Desktop (please complete the following information):**; - OS: Debian; - `uname-a`: Linux musculus 6.7.9-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.7.9-2 (2024-03-13) x86_64 GNU/Linux; - `lsb_release -a`; ```; No LSB modules are available.; Distributor ID: Debian; Description: Debian GNU/Linux trixie/sid; Release: n/a; Codename: trixie; ```. **Additional context**.

Integrability,"odel for data generated from any technology and that's what we have been trying to do with salmon for years, piece by piece. Having said that, we don't mean to discourage people from trying salmon, that's one of the way we learn how can we improve the model even further. Now, coming back to your original question about using QuantSeq with salmon and how the paper above approach to solve it. I have a couple of thoughts:; 1.) Like you said, from the reading of their command line argument they didn't use the `nolengthcorrection` and I am surprised about the results myself. Since you have experience with the technology, you are best person to explore the difference in using and not using the length correction with salmon, that's why I shared.; 2.) Salmon models the transcript lengths in its quantification model. The basic intuition being longer length transcripts have higher probability of a read being sampled from them and has to be corrected for when using relative count metrices (like TPM) to avoid length bias. The logic behind `noLengthCorrection` is to _not_ correct for length for 3' protocol since we expect all the reads from one end of the transcript and if we do length correction, I hypothesize, we might end up biasing the estimates on the opposite direction; however the effect size of this hypothesis is still an open question and seemingly from the results from the paper it has minor effect. On the flip side may be it does have effect but their baseline estimates were not great and any improvement is good, for that again since you have experience with the data it's good to know / test what's going on.; 3.) A little experimental thought, although `noLengthCorrection` flag can generate decent estimates, it's actually fully disabling the length effect, which in my opinion we can do better as you look at Figure 1B of the paper it shows some length based affect but again we don't know how much difference it can create in generating the estimates. .

Integrability,"ou'd expect to get more mappings) than when you specify ""ISR"". The ""A"" flag just looks at how the first 10,000 reads map and guesses the library type based on that. On thing to make sure of is that your reads aren't ""ordered"" in any way, such that you'd expect the first 10,000 to deviate in any meaningful way from the statistics of the reads of the reads. > Is it better to build assemblies with strand-aware flags? If so, does it usually make a large difference to quantification results, or a minor one? I don't know what protocol the sequencing facility used, but I am sure I could ask them. I gather from my recent reading that the extra information gained by using a stranded protocol is worthwhile, so I would expect that the sequencing facility used one, but why doesn't Trinity or MEGAHIT detect the sequecing protocol that was used? . So there are really 2 questions here. *If* the data are stranded, then yes, it's worthwhile to use stranded flags in both assembly and quantification. This is because stranded protocols will allow you to better disambiguate (a) overlapping genes and (b) reads that are ambiguous between sequence-similar genes that happen to reside on different strands. The *second* question is why Trinity or MEGAHIT wouldn't detect this. The main reason for this is that these are assembly tools. Without access to a reference genome, there is no principled way for these tools to know what the orientation of a read is _a priori_, so they generally rely on the user to specify if the reads are stranded or unstranded. > Or, if you have to specify it, why do none of the example Trinity commands I've come across include this option? It doesn't strike me as a commonly used specification in making assemblies.

Integrability,"quality-trimming, because if you do quality-trimming first, sometimes adapters will be partially trimmed and become too short to be recognized as adapter sequence. When you run BBDuk with both quality-trimming and adapter-trimming in the same run, it will do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming. 2. I very well know that the advantage of using fastp is that it can do adapter trimming, etc in a automatic fashion - no need to provide external sequences (example adapter sequences). Yes, I know one can also provide a fasta file of adapters and fatsp will work off it. There are many fatsp issues in GH about adapter detection:. - fail to detect adpaters automatically - (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/222 and https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/205). - [incorrect automatic adapter detection](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/240). - [inconsistent behavior with different runs](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/231). 3.

Integrability,"ranscriptome (with no decoys) gives me a mapping rate of `0.00378202832148367%`. The first thing I did was to quality and adapter trim the data (using `fastp -i SRR9007475.fastq.gz -o SRR9007475_trimmed.fastq.gz -q 10 -w 8`) and ... whoa. This is the fastp html report [fastp.html.zip](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/files/4176345/fastp.html.zip). So the first astounding statistic, the mean read length before trimming is 51bp (these are relatively short single-end reads). The mean read length after trimming is 21bp! So, the average read length is, in fact, less than the k-mer length used for indexing (default is k=31). On the trimmed data, the mapping rate goes up to `2.3545475882931305%`, still very low, but now there's somewhat of an explanation, the average read is shorter than a single k-mer. So, the next thing I tried was indexing with a smaller k; a _really_ small one in this case,`k=15`. Then, I re-ran on the _trimmed_ reads (the fact that the trimming took us from 51-21bp suggests that the reads had a lot of low quality bases, adapter contamination, or both). Under this setting, I still get a very low mapping rate, but it was _much_ higher — `16.766993524863488%`. The final thing I tried was seeing how the mapping rate changed as I altered `--minScoreFraction`, which is the salmon parameter that determines the alignment score that a read must achieve in order to be mapped validly. The default is 0.65. This means that the read cannot have a score < 0.65 * the maximum achievable score for the read given it's length. In the case of a 21bp read, the best score would be a score of 42, so a read must obtain a score >= 27 in order to be mapped. This is already a pretty poor mapping, but I reduced it even more to 0.3 (so any read with a score > 12 would pass). This led to a mapping rate of `~46%`. However, at this point, I'm not sure I would be confident in such mappings. For example, the situation here would be a 21bp read with multiple mismatches and, much of",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/482#issuecomment-583799668:1452,adapter,adapter,1452,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/482#issuecomment-583799668,1,['adapter'],['adapter']

In the ILMN analyses, there is great concordance between the SAF method and HISAT/STAR_RSEM method. However, in the QS analyses, there is very limited concordance between SAF and the HISAT/STAR_RSEM method. For QS analyses, the TXOME method shows great concordance with HISAT/STAR_RSEM. This finding made me wonder if this has to be something with my salmon quant command line options for QS.

Integrability,"thank you @alpapan, your post in this open issue had the information that helped me build the latest version of salmon (1.10.0 at this time) on Ubuntu 20 and 22. The documentation at https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building.html#requirements-for-building-from-source was not helping with the build errors reported here, which is what I encountered too. . In my case the problem was that I had a custom build of libstaden installed (that I did not want to remove) that cmake was picking up, but which triggered those many libcurl linking errors (misleadingly I would say, since it seems to be related to the way libstaden is installed, not directly libcurl related, which is fine on my system). Here it is the build recipe that worked for me on Ubuntu 20/22:; ```; sudo apt install libboost-iostreams-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-filesystem-dev \; libboost-timer-dev libboost-program-options-dev ; PREFIX=$HOME/sw # or wherever you want it; mkdir build && cd build; cmake -DNO_IPO=TRUE -DFETCH_STADEN=TRUE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${PREFIX} ..; make -j6; make install; ```; Note that the installation message states:; `Please add $PREFIX/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH` ; .. but that does not seem to be needed, the linker seems to resolve those libraries properly in the installation directory.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/425#issuecomment-1445139922:1110,message,message,1110,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/425#issuecomment-1445139922,1,['message'],['message']
Integrability,"the barcode detection - my usual approach with alevin at least is to let it try to estimate a ""real"" cell number, but if it's way off from our experimental expectations, to inject --expectCells ncells and let that serve as a starting point (with subsequent filtering). That has worked reasonably well in the past for me , and seems to be an option for alevin-fry as well. I don't know whether that is poor practice in the long run...it came from a place of seeing far too many weak knee plots early in the droplet scRNA-seq days. Are you generally more trusting of these estimates these days?. So one of the nice aspects of the alevin to alevin-fry pipeline is that it's relatively easy to try different filtering approaches since the initial mapping process only has to happen once. In general, the knee detection method is pretty good, and often gives a reasonable cell count. However, this isn't always the case. What we find in the alevin-fry pre-print is that it tends to be slightly more conservative than if you did e.g. unfiltered quantification followed by filtering with something like `DropletUtils` (but usually only slightly). The knee method is basically the iterative knee finding procedure from UMI-tools, with some slight tweaks to the parameters. However, unlike alevin, alevin-fry also supports unfiltered quantification. In this case, you provide an `unfiltered-permitlist`, which is a set of acceptable barcodes (not necessarily all expected to be present), and alevin-fry will correct against this. This will tend to produce a _lot_ of quantified cells, since we quantify any barcode matching 10 or more reads (by default, this value is modifiable on the command line). So, such unfiltered matrices definitely need to be filtered after quantification. However, for protocols with an external permit list, or those where you can reasonably derive a list of potential expected barcodes, it's less stringent and therefore potentially a bit more sensitive than knee-based filtering.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-988967759:1845,protocol,protocols,1845,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-988967759,1,['protocol'],['protocols']

So I actually went back a step and check my initial cmake command in the ../salmon-0.8.2/build/ directory. It also had the same issue and therefore wasn't building correctly.

It seemed to work nicely and I got all the build files to propagate into the ../salmon-0.8.2/build/ directory.

Integrability,"the unique-region-derived prior... . But as I think about it... I realize I don't *really* know the underlying algorithmic details of the existing implements. But it would be **amazing** if you could incorporate this type of information into Salmon. I really hope some progress can be made here! . Thanks again for helping me out and showing interest in the motivating problem!. P.S.,; As a total aside, I've been working with this large yeast RNAseq dataset and eventually reached the same conclusions as the selective alignment paper and other recent ones; that is, the most important aspect for getting good transcript-level quantifications is not aligning to the genome vs. aligning to the transcriptome, but rather having an accurate transcriptome annotation to begin with. I saw **huge** gains from updating my transcriptome annotation to include UTRs, especially given differences in coverage bias between samples... for example, if the actual transcript is 500 bp but the gene body is only 200 bp, slight coverage biases can propagate non-linearly and cause huge problems downstream. This got me thinking... if the end goal is differential expression analysis (and obviously this is not *always* the end goal), what if we just discard the notion of a pre-defined transcriptome and stick with equivalence classes, then do differential expression analysis on the equivalence classes themselves (perhaps calculated against the whole genome... this is feasible in yeast, maybe not in humans), then only after discovering significant differential expression one could work backwards to interpret the changes. Is this a crazy idea? Or not crazy at all and already routine? I know salmon can dump the counts to each equivalence class already so it's not hard for me to *do* what I just described, but I'm wondering if you have any opinions/insights into this idea.

Integrability,"vidence that they are _inherently_ uncertain given the read evidence and alignments used for quantification. The tool described in that paper, called [`terminus`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/terminus), is a tool for automatically finding such groups of transcripts. Anyway, once you have the Gibbs samples in hand, we can walk you though how to do some assessment of these transcripts (tagging @hiraksarkar here since he's most likely to have access to scripts that will let us look at the posterior samples from individual transcripts). Similarly, if you can provide the quantification directory, we can help examine this too. If this is the case, that the posterior distributions are highly anti-correlated, it is likely that the ambiguity you are seeing is simply inherent given the alignments salmon is being provided. If you have the quantification folder resulting from the same sample using selective alignment, we could compare and contrast the two. At that point, there are a few options depending on how deeply you want to dive. You could try to see how STAR and selective alignment are mapping differently to these transcripts. One potential difference is that STAR is _a lot_ more happy to softclip reads, which selective alignment won't do by default (you can test the effect with the `--softclipOverhangs` to allow selective alignment to softclip reads that hang off the transcript end or `--softclip` to allow softclips anywhere). Note that selective alignment may _still_ be a bit more conservative than STAR about softclips simply because of the nature of the scoring function it uses. This might give you a sense if one of these alignment methodologies is more consistent with your expectations in this case. Another option is to consider doing a grouping with `terminus`. This will reduce the set of ""genes"" that you can call as DE, because it will be happy to group together transcripts from different genes. However, it should help considerably in eliminating DE from highly-un",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/600#issuecomment-740363115:3323,depend,depending,3323,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/600#issuecomment-740363115,2,['depend'],['depending']
Integrability,"within the barcode read, ie something that could be handled with different `bc-geometry`, but maybe that's all you meant in terms of differing implementations. Regarding the BC1 and how it could be two sequences for the same sample - this is confusing to explain in text format, but all comes down to the sequential nature of how the cells acquire barcodes in this protocol. We start with a 96-well plate, where each of the top 48 wells contain BOTH an oligo-dT barcode and random hexamer barcode. The samples then get added to each well. Biochemistry happens. Then you pool all the cells together, split them back out into 48 wells again, and each well gets its own BC2. Then repeat for BC3. . So a given transcript may get amplified via one of two amplification primers (oligo-dT or random hexamer), but after that, will get a single BC2 sequence and BC3 sequence added after that. In Fig 1A of the Rosenberg paper, it's as though there isn't _just_ an orange sequence carrying out reverse transcription, there are actually two different (known) sequences associated with different routes of amplification per cell. . The net effect is that a given cell can contain transcripts that have a sequence like this:; AACGTGAT-CTGTAGCC-ACACAGAA. or like this:; GATAGACA-CTGTAGCC-ACACAGAA. where maybe the first sequence was amplified by oligo-dT and the second was amplified via a random hexamer. Because they have the same BC2 and BC3 sequence, and the BC1 sequences match a known pairing, we know they come from the same cell and therefore the data should be merged. . Any lab running these experiments will have a table of known pairings (ie the two barcodes added to each of first 48 wells), so that they can be merged and treated as though they came from the same cell. This can either be handled upstream of salmon/alevin as a preprocessing step, like what my slow perl script can do, or it can be handled internally. Having alevin do the collapsing would likely be a lot faster and means the FASTQs",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-937918722:1273,rout,routes,1273,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-937918722,2,['rout'],['routes']
Integrability,"x (which is the colored De Bruijn graph). I understand that this index (along with all the equivalence class) remains the same even when gene counts of different RNA-Seq samples are estimated. But I am a bit confused about the alignment-based method. In this case, salmon does not require an index since it has the actual alignments. If we have multiple samples, which are mapped to the same transcriptome will Salmon return the same set of equivalence classes? Since the samples are different the weights will change and so will the reads mapped to each equivalence class but will the set of eq. classes change?. The index remains the same when different samples are processed, just as with a traditional alignment tool like STAR or HISAT2. However, the set of equivalence classes are _not_ fixed between samples. The equivalence classes are induced by the specific set of aligned or mapped reads. Further, salmon adopts a notion of [range-factorized equivalence classes](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/i142/3953977) in which the equivalence relation depends not only on the transcripts to which a read aligns or maps, but also on the conditional probabilities of the fragment being generated from these transcripts, which itself depends on experiment-specific parameters like the fragment length distribution. Thus, it is not the case under either its own builtin lightweight (selective) alignment, nor when operating with an external BAM file, that the set of equivalence classes produced by salmon will be the same across samples. The equivalence classes are _based_ on the underlying reference sequence, but are sample specific and induced both by the specific patterns of multimapping as well as by the sample-specific parameters (like the fragment length distribution). Thus, if you wish to perform some type of equivalence-class type analysis over multiple samples, you'll need to take the union over the equivalence classes observed in each of them.

In the ILMN analyses, there is great concordance between the SAF method and HISAT/STAR_RSEM method. However, in the QS analyses, there is very limited concordance between SAF and the HISAT/STAR_RSEM method. For QS analyses, the TXOME method shows great concordance with HISAT/STAR_RSEM. This finding made me wonder if this has to be something with my salmon quant command line options for QS.

Modifiability," arise in some instances (like with many splicing isoforms or alternative transcriptional start/stop sites). . I'm curious to know how things progress on the issue. It seems like using the coverage as evidence of the transcript ""not being expressed at all"" may be too binary for this problem, certainly in real data, including my own, there are serious coverage dropoffs with long genes or low sequencing depth, and it doesn't mean the transcript is not expressed. Second, regarding unique mappers to the ""super transcript,"" this highlights the problem with using gene bodies that do not incorporate UTRs as in my examples above. The quantification can only be as good as the ground truth transcriptome you're working with, and so every gene is going to be a bit wrong if UTRs are not included in the transcriptome sequence. For my real data analysis, I've dealt with this by 1) adding UTRs to all genes whenever possible, and if no UTR data is given, then extending each gene body by ~100 bp in either direction (if two genes end up overlapping a bit, this ends up not being problematic at all because of how salmon apportions reads in accordance with the length bias model). Second, I set the mapping flags to --softclip and --minScoreFraction 0.3; this helps a LOT since if one read mate pair maps perfectly within a gene and the other is in an unannotated UTR region, it will still assign the read correctly to the gene. . Lastly, for solving the problem at hand with the ""super transcript"" scenario and using coverage... perhaps instead of looking for regions of zero coverage, you could keep track of the overall variance in read depth over a gene and assign reads in a way that minimizes variance; in my example, since the super transcripts has regions of very high read depth, zero read depth, and intermediate, the total variance in read depth across the gene would be quite high, while the variance over the sub-transcripts would be much lower. Similarly, in a scenario with a gene that has",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/514#issuecomment-670495465:1233,extend,extending,1233,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/514#issuecomment-670495465,1,['extend'],['extending']

Modifiability," decoys or the organism's genome as a decoy whenever possible. . 4) Related to @k3yavi's response and my elaboration above: we have dropped quasi-mapping from 1.0.0 (though something akin to it may return in the future if there is sufficient demand and if the shortcomings described in the manuscript can be overcome). However, as I mention in part 3 above, this doesn't mean it's not possible to use v1.0.0 without an explicit decoy sequence. The `--decoy` flag of the indexing command is optional, not required. We will update this in the documentation making it more explicit. However, as @k3yavi points out, it is true that if you wish to use quasi-mapping and selective-alignment against the full genome on the same machine, you will need both versions, as quasi-mapping is supported only in the [RapMap](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/RapMap/tree/develop-salmon), while indexing something on the scale of the genome when not using the [pufferfish-based](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish/tree/develop) index has tremendous memory requirements (as is not recommended ). 5 & 6) To re-iterate @k3yavi's answer --- the extra flags used in the pre-print were only for the purpose of holding as many variables fixed as possible when comparing different approaches. It continues to be recommended to use the VBEM over the EM; it seems to perform better with respect to the ways in which we can measure and such improvements have also been documented in [other work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23821651). The _main_ effect of `--mimicBT2` is to discard orphan alignments for the purposes of quantification. This is a more strict requirement than the default behavior of allowing orphans if there is no satisfactory alignment of both ends of a fragment. However, there is no obvious reason why it is better behavior than accounting for these orphan fragments (when appropriately adjusting the conditional probability given their distance from the transcript boundaries, as salmon does).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/442#issuecomment-549195390:2602,variab,variables,2602,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/442#issuecomment-549195390,2,['variab'],['variables']
Modifiability," described in the Bowtie2 manual)](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-dovetail) are considered discordant. This is the same default behavior imposed by Bowtie2. If you look in the `meta_info.json` file for some of these samples (which is in the `aux_info` subdirectory of the quantification directory for a sample), you can see how many mappings are being discarded by virtue of being dovetail mappings. It is possible to allow such alignments (consider them as concordant) by passing the `--allowDovetail` flag. It is not the case that such alignments are always ""bad"", its simply that one would not expect many fragments to align in such a way, and if these constitute the overwhelming majority of the mappings, one might be suspicious about the underlying data. * Selective alignment actually _aligns_ the reads to the transcriptome. For this purpose, it performs end-to-end alignment. This means that if you suspect that the sample may contain adapters or very low-quality read ends, the reads should be trimmed prior to quantification. It is, therefore, worth checking how the mapping rate changes for some of these samples if the reads are trimmed first. * Selective alignment is more robust than quasi-mapping to the chosen value of `-k`, the minimum match length used when searching for alignments. I noticed that some of the samples contain relatively short reads, so you might see if the mapping rate changes if you adopt a smaller value of `-k` in the index (e.g. we use `23` in the [pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v2.full.pdf)). * You mention that this index doesn't contain any decoy sequence. This of course, should not affect the mapping rate. However, I'd be quite curious to see if you index the reference using the _whole genome_ as decoy (i.e. the SAF method from the pre-print), how many reads are discarded because they map better to a decoy sequence (this information can also be obtained from `meta_info.json`).

Modifiability," transcript by salmon) as well as to the genome. It is quite common that the mapping rate to the genome is higher than that to the transcriptome. This is much more a result of what you are aligning _to_ than the aligner. If you were to take the transcriptome, and align to it using Hisat2 with `--no-spliced-alignment` and `--end-to-end` (since there won't be splice junctions when you align to the transcriptome), I'd expect you to get a similar mapping rate as you see in salmon. > I also noticed a high number of mappings discarded because of alignment score. I also wonder why the number of mappings discarded can be larger than num of processed (57113760, the reads number in 1_1.fq.gz). . Good question. The number you are looking at is the number of discarded _mappings_, not the number of discarded _fragments_. The difference is that every fragment can have many potential mappings. The number you are looking at is the total number of attempted _alignments_ that failed to achieve the threshold score. Luckily, salmon reports both numbers. The number of fragments for which _all_ alignments failed to reach the score threshold is `4,196,417`; given in `aux_info.json` by ` ""num_fragments_filtered_vm"": 4196417`. One point to note is that these are all fragments for which mapping is attempted (they had at least one k-mer match the reference), but no alignment was valid up to the threshold. You could try running the quantification again with `--softclip` to allow softclipping of the reads and see if any considerable fraction of these `4196417` failed to align because they overhang the annotated transcripts or contain adapters etc. Nonetheless, even if all of these mapped, the rate would still be ~72%. The remainder of the reads didn't even have a matching k-mer in common with the reference transcriptome, which means they are exceedingly unlikely to have come from the transcripts that were indexed. > Thanks.

Modifiability," v0.8 and 1.2.1. The one that seems most relevant here is the introduction of selective-alignment to replace the quasi-mapping procedure that was originally used in salmon. Selective-alignment actually scores the mappings found to the transcriptome, and rejects alignments whose quality is below a (user-specified) threshold. Here, you can see that, in 1.2.1. * 39 fragments are mapped within the score threshold; * 216 fragments are discarded because no mapping location has an alignment score above the threshold. all together, this means that the total number of ""mapped"" fragments in 1.2.1 is very similar to 0.8 (1.2.1 maps 39+216 = 255, while 0.8 maps 254). However, 1.2.1 discards 216 of the fragments because no mapping is sufficiently good. The default for ""sufficiently good"", by the way, is to have an alignment score of at least 65% of the maximum possible for a read of the given length. For typical RNA-seq data, this is actually quite liberal / generous, and is similar to the type of noise in alignment that Bowtie2 allows with the sensitive flag. In general, the heuristics used in 1.2.1 (selective-alignment) tend to be more sensitive than those used in 0.8 (quasi-mapping), since the mappings are then validated using alignment scoring. However, this does mean that the quality of the alignment along the whole read matters. Thus, it is more important to do quality / adapter trimming in the newer version compared to the older one. There is also a flag in 1.2.1 (`--softclip`) that will allow mismatches / gaps at the ends of reads to not detract from the alignment score. So, these are the main differences. However, looking at the output logs you provided, a couple of basic questions did come to mind. Why are there so few reads to begin with? Even in 0.8, only 254 reads mapped, which is obviously a very small number of reads. Is there something non-typical about this sample? Is it a full RNA-seq sample? Are these reads something atypical (like long reads — ONT or PacBio)?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/542#issuecomment-651332239:1497,adapt,adapter,1497,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/542#issuecomment-651332239,1,['adapt'],['adapter']

Modifiability,"**Is the bug primarily related to salmon (bulk mode) or alevin (single-cell mode)?**; Either. **Describe the bug**; This is really a feature request -- apologies if it shouldn't go here. Bowtie and similar tools (e.g. STAR) can use memory mapping or shared memory for the genome index. This has a nice benefit: in scenarios where N Bowtie processes simultaneously aligning to the same index on the same system, the index memory footprint is incurred once (not N times). I may soon be running many simultaneous `salmon quant` processes on the sam system, all quantifying with respect to the same (human) transcriptome index. The memory footprint is around 3GB, which adds up when there are many `salmon quants`s. I don't expect to have lots of free RAM on this system, since other simultaneously-running processes will be aligning and incurring a much larger footprint (but using shared memory). If salmon used memory mapping or shared memory for the index, I basically wouldn't have to worry about the peak memory footprint breaking the budget. Hence the request!. **To Reproduce**; Steps and data to reproduce the behavior:. * I looked in the issues and in the documentation for Salmon 0.11.3 and couldn't find any indication this is supported.; * I ran a bunch of simultaneous `salmon quant`s w/r/t the same index on a Linux system. Running `top` showed a very low number in the `SHR` column for those processes (with a high number, ~3GB, in the `RES` column), consistent with their not using shared memory or memory mapping. **Expected behavior**; A good way to test if it's working is to run simultaneous processes w/ same index and check the `SHR` column in `top`. If it's working, that should should be some large size. **Screenshots**; N/A. **Desktop (please complete the following information):**; I'm mainly interested in seeing this feature for Linux, but it's great if it works elsewhere too.

Modifiability,"**Is the bug primarily related to salmon (bulk mode) or alevin (single-cell mode)?**; alevin. **Describe the bug**; We have an adapted Celseq2 protocol, where read1 (42bp) is used as the sequencing read and read2 (also 42bp) contains (5' -> 3') the barcode (8bp), UMI (8bp), 26 remaining nt's. Alevin seems to run fine, but the quant matrix has a very low UMI count, which does not fit with the _MappedUMI.txt_ file or the reported alignment rate.; ; **To Reproduce**; First, I put the UMI in front of the barcode.; `zcat R2.fastq.gz | paste - - - - | awk '{print $1"" ""$2""\n""substr($3,9,8)substr($3,1,8)substr($3,17)""\n""$4""\n""$5}' | pigz -p8 > R2_Alevin.fq.gz`. then, I run Alevin with:; `salmon alevin -lA -i ref_genome/index/ --barcodeLength 8 --umiLength 8 --end 5 -1 fq/R2_Alevin.fq.gz -2 fq/R1.fastq.gz -p 8 --tgMap ref_genome/gencode.vM20.tx2gene.tsv -o alevin_out --dumpUmiGraph --dumpFeatures --dumpCsvCounts --whitelist BC.whitelist`. This seems to work: the library is 47M and the _filtered_cb_frequency.txt_ contains 43M assigned barcodes in total. The _MappedUmi.txt_ contains 18.5M UMIs, fitting perfectly with the reported alignment rate of ~40% (which is relatively low, but OK for this library). Also if I use the `--dumpfq` option, the barcodes and UMIs are nicely attached to the sequencing reads. Strangely, if I sum the entries in the CSV or binary quant matrix, I get ~3.75M reads. ; ; I was able to run the 10x PBMC4k example and there, the sum of the count matrix entries indeed fitted the reported UMI counts and mapping rate. .

When you run BBDuk with both quality-trimming and adapter-trimming in the same run, it will do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming. 2. I very well know that the advantage of using fastp is that it can do adapter trimming, etc in a automatic fashion - no need to provide external sequences (example adapter sequences). Yes, I know one can also provide a fasta file of adapters and fatsp will work off it. There are many fatsp issues in GH about adapter detection:. - fail to detect adpaters automatically - (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/222 and https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/205). - [incorrect automatic adapter detection](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/240). - [inconsistent behavior with different runs](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/231). 3.

Big Picture - DEG identification for samples sequenced by ILMN (whole transcript method) and QS (3' method) - [something similar to this paper](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-018-5393-3).

I used UpSetR plots for comparisons of sets of DEGs from each method just [as you have shown in your recent preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v1.full). In the ILMN analyses, there is great concordance between the SAF method and HISAT/STAR_RSEM method. However, in the QS analyses, there is very limited concordance between SAF and the HISAT/STAR_RSEM method. For QS analyses, the TXOME method shows great concordance with HISAT/STAR_RSEM. This finding made me wonder if this has to be something with my salmon quant command line options for QS. Therefore, I wanted to check how the QS expected counts for SAF method show up for all samples in my final summarized table (after tximport).

Both Alevin and Cell ranger count only reads aligned to exons by default, thus losing some 35% of the reads. Large intronic proportions are a general feature of single-cell RNA-seq, for example the 10X PBMCs has ~20-25%, and nuclear data sets have 46% intronic reads in [[source](https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000087552-Why-do-I-have-a-high-percentage-of-reads-mapping-to-intronic-regions-)]. . **So the best way to increase library 'quality' / counting statistics (which is my prime concern) seem to be including reads mapped to introns – leading to hopefully a large increase in UMIs.**. ### Considerations: separate, additive signals. Since exons and introns contain different biological signal, ideally I would like to count as:. 1. Exon only 		(current)* ; 2. Intron only 		(as control / comparison to 1.) ; 3. Exon + intron 	(finally, for boosting statistics) . Where 2 would be a complementary set to 1, so that no read is counted as both intron and exon, and thus 1+2 =~ 3. . \* _I am not sure what happens to a read that maps to an exon/intron junction using the default Alevin and 10x Cell Ranger pipelines, but I assume both count it as exonic._. ### Solution by counting programs. - There is a way to build a ""pre-mRNA"" reference for 10X Cell ranger as described [here](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/references#premrna). . - I wondered if Alevin can be adapted to this aim? I guess besides all complete transcript models, you need to add one more: the pre-mRNA. (While some complexity can theoretically arise by the serial nature of splicing, I would ignore it at first).

Modifiability,"/PMC6129281/figure/bty560-F1/). - [To quote Brian Bushnell (author of BBTools)]( http://seqanswers.com/forums/showpost.php?p=140819&postcount=5), . > It's best to do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming, because if you do quality-trimming first, sometimes adapters will be partially trimmed and become too short to be recognized as adapter sequence. When you run BBDuk with both quality-trimming and adapter-trimming in the same run, it will do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming. 2. I very well know that the advantage of using fastp is that it can do adapter trimming, etc in a automatic fashion - no need to provide external sequences (example adapter sequences). Yes, I know one can also provide a fasta file of adapters and fatsp will work off it. There are many fatsp issues in GH about adapter detection:. - fail to detect adpaters automatically - (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/222 and https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/205). - [incorrect automatic adapter detection](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/240). - [inconsistent behavior with different runs](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/231). 3. When I see the above, I am bit skeptical using fastp for qc/adapter trimming. . After lot of trials with bbduk and fastp, I have decided to use bbduk and bbmap for my high throughput analysis. Below, I explain my reasoning behind those choices: . **_```Note - edited this on 02-Apr-2020 to have the correct order of operations ```_** . 1. **_STEP 1 - run bbmap.sh on raw fatsq file to remove contaminants as appropriate (rRNA, mitochondrial, chloroplast)_**; - You have alluded to the importance of removing contaminants [in this post](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/160#issuecomment-334762498); >However, the other thing to try is simply to align one of these samples to the genome with a tool like STAR or HISAT2 and look at their mapping rate to known features.

Modifiability,"@Gaura this sort of frameshift in the barcodes is a known issue, and can be computationally challenging (at least for existing methods). zUMIs, for example, does an automatic barcode detection based on fixed barcode positions like we're doing here with alevin, so it would mis-detect cells like the shifted ones you pasted above. For SPLiT-seq, we do know exactly which barcodes go into the wells, however, so it is technically possible to restrict based on all possible known combinations of barcodes instead and be more positionally flexible. But deciding how many indel bases are allowable, and presumably doing multiple passes through the data to establish an include-list could be time-consuming. Further, the zUMIs developer rightly mentions [in this thread](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/issues/63) that there are likely going to be _many_ unused barcode combinations this way, so lots of time could be spent looking for ""cells"" that don't actually exist in the data. The authors of the paper from which our test dataset was derived describe in their methods using a Drop-seq computational framework, so I'm not sure which approach theirs is more similar to. . The simplest approach here is certainly the automatic detection, but it will come at the cost of losing meaningful reads to frameshift errors. . My guess is this falls well out of the scope of alevin, but if you're interested in improving on that, there may be a middle ground between the two approaches above, one that I'm not sure if your group or others have attempted for other methods: we could essentially do a 2-pass barcode detection. The first pass would restrict based on positions like we're already doing, and establish an include-list of possible barcodes seen in the data. Then we could pass through the barcode sequences a second time, looking only for those sequence combinations, but allowing 1-2bp flexibility in the positions they occur, potentially rescuing some of the ones missed during the first pass.

Modifiability,"@sjackman ,. Thanks for raising this question. I actually think that making the barcode processing phase of alevin a bit more general sounds like an excellent idea. Right now, the barcode processing is parameterized by a class that describes the barcode layout etc. These are represented, basically, as C++ policy classes. However, having a custom policy (specified in e.g. a YAML file or some such) wouldn't be too difficult to do, and might make the barcode processing useful in a larger context. We'd be happy to help implement this and see if it works in your context. One question to resolve first, though (please chime in here @k3yavi) is what assumptions make sense for bar code correction in each datatype. That is, do we expect similar-ish numbers and distributions of barcodes, etc. so that our ""knee-in-the-curve"" heuristics still make sense?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/233#issuecomment-395180151:202,parameteriz,parameterized,202,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/233#issuecomment-395180151,1,['parameteriz'],['parameterized']

Modifiability,"@zhangchipku,. Yes, it seems that the biggest culprit here is `num_fragments_filtered_vm`. That is the number of fragments filtered because the best alignment failed to reach the threshold for a ""valid"" alignment. Here, `47,470,013` fragments are discarded entirely because they didn't have an alignment meeting the required quality. If these fragments (which do have matching MEMs, because alignment was carried out for them) were mapped, then the overall mapping rate would go up to `50,729,814 + 47,470,013 = 98,199,827 / 107,275,750 = ~91.5%`. Now, I wouldn't expect _all_ of these to be mappable, and some alignments might not be feasible at any reasonable quality whatsoever. My recommendation would be as follows. First, have you trimmed these reads (using e.g. `fastp` or `TrimGalore` or some such)? Very low quality read ends or (more likely) adapter contamination could cause the reads that have matching MEMs to fail to align within the required score threshold. My first recommendation would be to trim the reads and see how the mapping rate changes. Second, the required alignment score is a user-alterable parameter. By changing `--minScoreFraction` to be lower, you can allow reads with even lower alignment scores to be counted for quantification. The default value is `0.65`, so you could explore what happens if you lower this number. The number represents the fraction of the maximum achievable alignment score that a read must obtain to be considered a valid alignment. --Rob",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/485#issuecomment-586473052:852,adapt,adapter,852,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/485#issuecomment-586473052,1,['adapt'],['adapter']

Modifiability,"Add [sci-rna-seq3 protocol](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0969-x) to salmon alevin. To use this protocol pass the `--sciseq3` flag. The details of library preparation can be seen [here](https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/methods_html/sci-RNA-seq3.html). Briefly, the reads have 9-10 bp hairpin adaptor index, and 10bp reverse transcription index which together make the cell barcode of 19-20 bp in length; an 8 bp UMI which follows a 6bp anchor sequence CAGAGC. . Summary of changes:; 1. `--sciseq3` flag added to process sci-rna-seq3 reads; 2. a local copy of single cell protocol is created before barcodes and UMI are extracted to allow share the position of anchor sequence and avoid searching twice; 3. In case the barcode is 19bp, `A` is added as the last nucleotide to make the cell barcodes length 20 bp for all barcodes.

Modifiability,"After generating issue #48, I took the recommendation of switching to the standard EM algorithm, but I'm having further problems. However, I don't think the problem was with the Variational EM algorithm, but an issue with how the dataset is behaving. . This is with the same dataset as before (single end, rRNA-depleted, second-strand protocol, extreme depth of 170M+ reads). I have the options --useFSPD and --biasCorrect turned on with library type ""SF""; the full call is . ```; salmon quant -i $SALMON_DIR -l SF -r <(gzip -c -d $IN_FILE) -o $OUTPUT \; --numBootstraps 100 --useFSPD --geneMap $GENES \; --biasCorrect -p 59; ```. I had attempted to use wasabi and run sleuth, but I got an error where the number of transcripts passing the initial filter was ""NA"". I then discovered that for four samples, many of the transcripts had ""-nan"" generated for the ""NumReads"" column, and this led to all of them having ""-nan"" for the TPM column. One sample had ~100 that failed, but the other three had a variable 106K-109K out of 176K total transcripts fail. No warning or error was thrown during the quantifying or EM optimization steps, so I don't know what happened. Interesting, I should note that the NaNs are only generated when both biasCorrect and useFSPD are turned on. NaNs are not generated when I use only one or neither option.

Modifiability,"Dear Salmon team,. We have previously been using salmon 0.8.1 for our RNA sequencing analysis pipeline and wanted to upgrade to the latest version (1.3.0).

For this particular downsampled bam file, salmon 0.8.1 got 36.9% of TPM’s unequal 0 but for all three differently configured salmon 1.3.0 runs that number drops to 7.3%. .

In short, the R1 file contains cDNA sequence, and R2 contains a 10bp UMI followed by 3 different barcodes in the following arrangements (note: ParseBio seems to shift BC1 up a few bp, to 79-86):; - UMI: 1-10; - BC3: 11-18; - BC2: 49-56; - BC1: 87-94. The intervening bases are a combination of common and variable sequences. The other wrinkle with these approaches is that the cDNA can be amplified using either oligo-dT or random hexamer barcodes. The net effect of this is that BC1 can be one of two options, and some barcode combinations need to be pooled to represent the same cell. For example:. AACGTGAT-CTGTAGCC-ACACAGAA; GATAGACA-CTGTAGCC-ACACAGAA. may be the same cell, amplified by two different means. . We know how the BC1s are paired, so Avi suggested pre-processing the R2 FASTQ file such that we locate random hexamer BC1 sequences and modify them to the matched oligo-dT sequence. In the above example, we'd correct some R2 reads that contain ""GATAGACA"" in the 87-94 position to ""AACGTGAT"".

That would be something like:. ```; $ gdb --args salmon index -t transcripts.fasta -i sample_salmon_fmd_index --type fmd; ```. and then, when you encounter the segfault issuing the back-trace `bt` command.

Modifiability,"Hi @PeteHaitch ,; Thanks for your interest in *Alevin*.; Although in current Alevin we have concentrated mainly on learning more about Droplet based 3'-tagged single cell protocols, especially 10x; we are very much interested in extending it towards other protocols like CEL-seq.; However, there are couple of challenges/difference which should be considered before incorporating it into the Alevin pipeline. Currently Alevin relies on the fact that the droplet based protocols use PCR amplification of the library and the UMI deduplication phase of Alevin assumes an exponential model, I am not sure how true is this with CEL-seq? Another issue is that CEL-seq is a Fluidigm based system while the current application for Alevin is for microfluidics based.

Modifiability,"Hi @PlantDr430,. Thanks for the detailed report. I have a general thought, and then a more specific thought given your use case and parameter settings. The general thought is that it is _not_ true, broadly, that one should expect transcript (or even gene) abundances to stay the same under a change of annotation. The estimates computed by salmon (and by all transcript-level abundance estimation tools) is one that maximizes the likelihood of the data (or maximizes the ELBO in the case of VI) _conditioned on_ the observed fragments and the _transcripts_. When one changes the transcripts, they change the variable upon which the inference is conditioned, and the results, in general, can change (a lot, or a little bit). This is specifically most prone to happen when transcripts / genes are added to the annotation that are similar to other transcripts or genes in the annotation. Now, my specific thought based on your settings of parameters. They are _quite_ different, but the three big factors I see here are (1) the setting for `--scoreExp`, (2) the setting(s) for dovetail and softclipOverhangs and (3) the setting for `--consensusSlack` Why are they a big deal?. * `--scoreExp` determines how much we down-weight scores sub-optimal alignments. Setting `--scoreExp` to 0 says that a sub-optimal alignment, at least in terms of the alignment probability is _just as good as the optimal alignment_. So, imagine you had a few read length regions of a pair of genes that each differed by 1 or 2 SNPs. When `--scoreExp` is 0, then the model considers alignments (say to transcript 2) with 2 substitutions to be just as likely as alignments (say to transcript 1) that are perfect (with no substitutions). While you can play around with different values of `--scoreExp` to determine how differences from the optimal alignment should be weighted, I'd strongly suggest against setting `--scoreExp` equal to 0. * `--allowDovetail` and `--softclipOverhangs` may or may not have a significant effect bas",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/523#issuecomment-632953613:608,variab,variable,608,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/523#issuecomment-632953613,1,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"Hi @gringer,. Yes, we can add a section for this in the docs. It will replace the old way for specifying geometry soon, as its just easier and more flexible. We talk about it in the 1.4.0 release notes. I copy the relevant info below (@k3yavi pulled for the 1-based indexing and won out ... this time):. generic barcode / umi / read geometry syntax : Alevin learned to support a generic syntax to specify the read sequence that should be used for barcodes, UMIs and the read sequence. The syntax allows one to specify how the pattern corresponding to the barcode, UMI, and read sequence should be pieced together, and the syntax is meant to be intuitive and general. For example, one can specify the 10Xv2 geometry in the following manner using the generic syntax:. --read-geometry 2[1-end] --bc-geometry 1[1-16] --umi-geometry 1[17-26]. This specifies that the ""sequence"" read (the biological sequence to be aligned) comes from read 2, and it spans from the first index 1 (this syntax used 1-based indexing) until the end of the read. Likewise, the barcode derives from read 1 and occupies positions 1-16, and the UMI comes from read 1 and occupies positions 17-26. The syntax can specify multiple ranges, and they will simply be concatenated together to produce the string. For example, one could specify --bc-geometry 1[1-8,16-23] to designate that the barcode should be taken from the substring in positions 1-8 of read 1 followed by the substring in positions 16-23 of read 1. It is even possible to have the string pieced together across both reads, but that functionality is only available if you are running with --rad or --sketch and preparing a RAD file for alevin-fry. If you are running classic alevin, the barcode must reside on a single read.

Modifiability,"Hi @guidohooiveld, . Regarding your questions:. (1) The motivation behind asking users to use Bioconda to install the binary is to limit the number of variables we may encounter when someone is reporting a bug --- i.e. if there are fewer distribution channels there is less maintenance overhead. Nonetheless, as you can see, I've had to make the binary available anyway, because it was the only way some people could easily get the program. Therefore, I think I'll start attaching binaries to releases again. (2) Yes, though this functionality is not part of Salmon itself. I *highly* recommend the [MultiQC](http://multiqc.info/) tool. MultiQC has a salmon module, which will parse all of the salmon log files in an experiment directory and produce a report. This report will contain the mapping percentages for all of the samples extracted from the salmon logs (and will color them nicely). It will also produce other QC information from the salmon runs. We are currently working on an improved multi-QC module, which will also provide summaries for things like GC / seq bias by analyzing the models that salmon learns, but this module isn't yet complete.

Modifiability,"Hi @k3yavi , thank you for the reply. Yes, you are right, it seems the problem is indeed in the whitelist `known_cb.txt`. However, I cannot seem to find out what exactly is going on with the file. When I wrote a python script to check the length of each cell barcode in `known_cb.txt`, _all_ of them are 16 bp long. This is the python script:. ```; $ cat print_length.py; with open('known_cb.txt') as fh:; for i in fh:; print(len(i)); ```. since each line has 16 bp barcode and a `\n` character, it outputs 17, which is expected. However, when I used `awk` to check the length, I expected `awk` to output 16, but it actually output 17:. ```; $ awk '{print length($0);}' known_cb.txt | head -2; 17; 17; ```. There might be some hidden characters that I missed. Any idea what's going?. Now, I have cleaned the `known_cb.txt`, and `alevin` runs without problem. For combinatorial indexing, good to known that it will be supported in future. I guess depending on assays, it needs to be a bit more flexible than the current options. The current options have only `--chromium` and `--dropseq` available. However, there are a few different combinatorial indexing assays. For `sci-RNA-seq`, the cell barcodes are within `I1.fastq`, `I2.fastq` and `R1.fastq`. Only `R2.fastq` is useful for gene quantification. For `sci-ATAC-seq`, the cell barcodes (this is just my educational guess) are within `I1.fastq` and `I2.fastq`, and both `R1.fastq` and `R2.fastq` contain useful information from the genome. For other plate-based method, there will be well barcodes and plate barcodes, which could be located in any of those 4 fastq files depends on the design. The cell barcodes will be a combination of well barcodes and plate barcodes. Thank you very much for the help.

Indeed, the total UMI count is **much** lower than the number of sequenced/mapped/barcoded reads (~190M), which is expected. However, using the `--dumpUmiGraph` option provides a file ""MappedUMI.txt"" which I assume are the number of deduplicated UMIs mapped per cell/barcode (summed over all genes).

Modifiability,"Hi @kvittingseerup,. No need to apologize, I think it was I who was not clear. What I am saying is that this is *already* the way that Salmon handles such a case. That is, if you have a paired-end read, and one of the reads maps but the other doesn't (due to e.g., adapter contamination or just very low quality), then Salmon will consider the remaining (mapping) end of the read as representative of an entire fragment, and will resolve the fragment origin accordingly during optimization. Generally, not having both ends of a paired-end read leads to increased ambiguity, but this isn't a particularly big problem if it only happens to a generally small fraction of the reads. Further, since you cannot reliably infer the implied fragment length on a transcript from only a single-end read, such mappings will not contribute to the bias model. Again, however, as long as this doesn't happen to the vast majority of fragments, it should have only a negligible effect on quantification and bias correction.

Modifiability,"Hi @lauraht,. So I decided to explore just one of these to see if I could figure out what might be going on. The below is with respect to `SRR9007475`. So first, even though I processed the data with the latest version of the develop branch (which will become 1.2.0), I got basically identical results to what you reported. Simply aligning the data against an index built on a human Gencode v26 transcriptome (with no decoys) gives me a mapping rate of `0.00378202832148367%`. The first thing I did was to quality and adapter trim the data (using `fastp -i SRR9007475.fastq.gz -o SRR9007475_trimmed.fastq.gz -q 10 -w 8`) and ... whoa. This is the fastp html report [fastp.html.zip](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/files/4176345/fastp.html.zip). So the first astounding statistic, the mean read length before trimming is 51bp (these are relatively short single-end reads). The mean read length after trimming is 21bp! So, the average read length is, in fact, less than the k-mer length used for indexing (default is k=31). On the trimmed data, the mapping rate goes up to `2.3545475882931305%`, still very low, but now there's somewhat of an explanation, the average read is shorter than a single k-mer. So, the next thing I tried was indexing with a smaller k; a _really_ small one in this case,`k=15`. Then, I re-ran on the _trimmed_ reads (the fact that the trimming took us from 51-21bp suggests that the reads had a lot of low quality bases, adapter contamination, or both). Under this setting, I still get a very low mapping rate, but it was _much_ higher — `16.766993524863488%`. The final thing I tried was seeing how the mapping rate changed as I altered `--minScoreFraction`, which is the salmon parameter that determines the alignment score that a read must achieve in order to be mapped validly. The default is 0.65. This means that the read cannot have a score < 0.65 * the maximum achievable score for the read given it's length. In the case of a 21bp read, the best score would be ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/482#issuecomment-583799668:518,adapt,adapter,518,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/482#issuecomment-583799668,1,['adapt'],['adapter']

Modifiability,"Hi @mishaprochazka and @jdidion,. Thanks @jdidion for pinging me on this. Somehow, Gmail has decided that all GitHub notifications (except those that explicitly tag me, but somehow I missed this one) should go to SPAM. So, I've been missing some of the newer issues here. The short answer is that the documentation needs to be updated. When salmon was originally published, we made use of [RapMap](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/RapMap) as the underlying mapper, which performed quasi-mapping against an index that consisted of a suffix array and a hash over k-mers pointing to prefixes in the suffix array (similar to the strategy used by STAR, but using much longer k-mers to improve lookup speed). We referred to this index as the quasi-index. As the software evolved and we continued to improve the mapping methodology, we eventually transitioned over to an index based on [our pufferfish data structure](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish). In addition to the new data structure, this coincided with our move over to selective-alignment as the mapping algorithm, and all of this happened at the 1.0.0 release (this is why, for example, indices built before 1.0.0 are not compatible with salmon > 1.0.0; a topic on which there have been a few GitHub issues). However, given the fact that the documentation and software are linked only through manual human intervention (we haven't leveled up to e.g. having salmon be a [literate program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) yet), these two sometimes get out of sync. This is an instance of that. We have maintained the functionality of the `--writeMappings` feature, and in fact, even augmented it. However, we have not replaced the antiquated `quasi-index` terminology in the documentation. The TLDR is that you can use `--writeMappings` with the index you built with the `salmon index` command, and it should work fine.

I'm also not a CMake expert, but I've failed with it enough times to start to get a handle. I have actually moved to the latest version of Jellyfish (v2.2.3) in the [quasimapping branch](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/quasimapping), which will be merged back into master as soon as we've finished porting the bootstrapping feature from [sailfish-master](https://github.com/kingsfordgroup/sailfish). Regarding supporting external versions of the libraries — this absolutely makes sense. What is the standard location where they are assumed to be installed? In this case I can search with a `FindPackage` before I attempt to download them. From the list above, I see two potential problem libraries:; - bwa — We actually use a modified version of bwa that accepts and uses an extra parameter that specifies the suffix array sampling frequency. Specifically, we, by default, use a denser sampling of the suffix array to trade off extra space usage for more speed in lookup. The standard bwa, therefore, probably wouldn't work.; - jellyfish — I actually tried to use jellyfish without obtaining the source and building it early on in development. I ran into an issue where the config.h file generated during compile wasn't installed by Jellyfish, and this caused runtime failures when Salmon was running. It seems to me that either (1) config.h should be installed with jellyfish by default or (2) it shouldn't be necessary to use jellyfish as a library. However, as far as I know, this issue persists in the latest version of jellyfish (if you want to use it as a library as we do, and not just as a k-mer counter). For the remaining libraries, we just use the standard versions, so this should be _OK_.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/19#issuecomment-144721158:1320,config,config,1320,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/19#issuecomment-144721158,2,['config'],['config']

The argument passed to the `-i` flag of `salmon alevin` must be the directory where all of the index files live.

Modifiability,"Hi @rob-p . Before I answer your question and layout my logic, I want to mention that I am **_not_** suggesting fastp is not doing its job, **_neither am I stating that fastp is working incorrectly_**. Now to my answer(s) and logic:; 1. With fastp, I am not sure if adapter trimming happens first and then quality trimming OR vice-versa. I could not find info on this from their README and **_I could be wrong here with my next line_** - [Based on Figure 1 of this paper, it looks to me as though quality trimming is done before adapter trimming](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6129281/figure/bty560-F1/). - [To quote Brian Bushnell (author of BBTools)]( http://seqanswers.com/forums/showpost.php?p=140819&postcount=5), . > It's best to do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming, because if you do quality-trimming first, sometimes adapters will be partially trimmed and become too short to be recognized as adapter sequence. When you run BBDuk with both quality-trimming and adapter-trimming in the same run, it will do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming. 2. I very well know that the advantage of using fastp is that it can do adapter trimming, etc in a automatic fashion - no need to provide external sequences (example adapter sequences). Yes, I know one can also provide a fasta file of adapters and fatsp will work off it. There are many fatsp issues in GH about adapter detection:. - fail to detect adpaters automatically - (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/222 and https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/205). - [incorrect automatic adapter detection](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/240). - [inconsistent behavior with different runs](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/231). 3. When I see the above, I am bit skeptical using fastp for qc/adapter trimming. . After lot of trials with bbduk and fastp, I have decided to use bbduk and bbmap for my high throughput analysis.

Modifiability,Hi @rob-p . Thanks for the elaborate answer - makes a lot of sense. The problem is that adapter contamination typically occures because the fragments were smaller than the sequence length we sequence into the adapters - and it can occur for a larger fraction of the reads (I've seen up to 50% of reads affected in the 3'end) making it non-negligible. That is why I suggested the extension in the first place. I think it makes a lot of sense to trim adapters away - both because they reduce the number of compatible reads - mostly because the failure to do so will result in an overestimation of the fragment length. . Now that I think about it I don't think we should trim reads based on quality as that will lead to an underestimation of the read length - or what do you think?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/150#issuecomment-355909325:88,adapt,adapter,88,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/150#issuecomment-355909325,3,['adapt'],"['adapter', 'adapters']"

Modifiability,"Hi @tillea,. It seems this is exactly the problem. The build deps here are not quite correct. There are dependencies that salmon no longer has, and some of the dependencies it does have are out of date and can't be used from upstream (e.g. libstaden in the latest version, among others). On the bright side, it's not the dynamic linking alone that is problematic.

Modifiability,"Hi @wdecoster,. Thanks for reporting this. One restriction that needs to be better documented (actually, I have to make sure it is properly documented at all!) is that the library type should come _before_ the reads they describe. That is, you should consider passing `-l SF -r {}` rather than `-r {} -l SF`. The reason for this is that the `-r` and `-1,-2` parameters are repeatable so you could, conceivably, pass multiple reads of different library types. However, this is a feature that nobody uses and frankly doesn't make too much sense (so I'll consider removing it in the future to simplify library type parsing). For the time being, I'll also consider printing a warning message when a read file is encountered without an explicitly pre-defined library type (in that case, the behavior, as you saw, is to assume an unstranded library). Could you let me know if passing `-l` before `-r` resolves the issue for you. As to your other suggestion. The internal capitalization rules follow those for camel-case naming of variables (as opposed to separating words with`_`). However, I realize this is somewhat esoteric and even among those who are familiar with such conventions, an arbitrary preference. I'll look into aliasing this flag (and maybe others) to be usable with different names as well.

So I don't know if there is a easy way to get the specific list of reverse dependencies, but then we can cross-check it with my explicit list above:. ```; build-essential; git ; libboost-all-dev ; liblzma-dev ; libbz2-dev ; cmake ; zlib1g-dev ; curl ; unzip ; wget ; libcurl4-openssl-dev ; libtbb-dev ; libtbb12 ; liblzma-dev ; libjemalloc2 ; pkg-config ; libgff-dev; ```. One thing I noticed during build is that, while I included `libjemalloc2` here, the salmon build procedure still downloaded and built `jemalloc`. However, I don't _think_ jemalloc is the thing causing the segfault. Regarding dependencies that can't be used — the current `libstaden` is behind the upstream release. The upstream release contains an important bug fix for a bug (and suggested fix that we proposed to the developer) upon which we rely. More importantly, afaik there is no relevant `libpufferfish-dev` package (we certainly have not made one), and so there is not even e.g. a check in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Salmon's build always tries to run `fetchPufferfish.sh` to download the relevant `pufferfish` source files needed to build `salmon`. Critically, the relevant `pufferfish` dependencies and `salmon` releases move in lockstep. Each new `salmon` release it accompanied by a new tag in the `pufferfish` repo (so that the specific source used to build a given `salmon` release is fixed and easily trackable). So, I think the easiest way to move forward is to:. * do a diff of my list of packages above with what is pulled in by `apt build-dep salmon`. * figure out why, even when `libjemalloc2` is installed, the build system tries to build `jemalloc` itself (maybe we need the dev package?). * determine what folks want to do upstream about the lockstep pufferfish dependency. Right now, the `fetchPufferfish.sh` script pulls a tagged tarball from github and checks that the sha matches, and moves the relevant source files into place. This is true both when we build our own releases as well as",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/835#issuecomment-1464538233:360,config,config,360,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/835#issuecomment-1464538233,1,['config'],['config']
Modifiability,"Hi Brian,. In general, I would argue that one should be cautious with removing PCR duplicates in RNA-seq data (unless you are dealing with reads with UMI tags). This is because reads that align to the same reference position can easily have come from alternative transcripts sharing the same underlying sequence. Hence, the normal tests used to infer PCR duplicates with e.g. DNA-seq reads can yield false-positives in RNA-seq. This is particularly true for highly abundant transcripts (or transcripts from highly-abundant genes). We are currently working on the code that will do duplicate removal when UMI tags are present. That methodology can be extended to remove duplicates even without UMI tags --- though I'd generally caution against that for the reasons mentioned above. However, for the time being, if you have a strong need or desire to filter PCR duplicates, you could use alignment-based Salmon with a BAM file that has duplicates removed. Finally, regarding the error you are getting during SAM validation; this sounds like a different issue. Would you mind providing a piece of that SAM file for me to take a look at? Specifically, I don't believe the quasi-mapping output file should even contain unmapped reads (unless you consider unmapped mates of orphaned reads). --Rob",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/136#issuecomment-305317281:650,extend,extended,650,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/136#issuecomment-305317281,1,['extend'],['extended']

Modifiability,"Hi Hari,. Some thoughts on your questions:. > I had to use mem_free=34G for building index. Is that expected?. Certainly, it is _not_ the case that index creation should require 34G of physical memory. When indexing the genome and transcriptome in dense mode, we typically expect it to require <20G of physical RAM (and <4 for just the transcriptome). However, we have noticed some strange behavior in the past about how compute clusters manage process allocation — sometimes, it seems, one must overcommit. Given the diversity of different software on which different compute clusters run, as well as the manifold way sysadmins may configure these things, we've not found a universal explanation / conclusion yet, but it does seem that the resources actually required (e.g. if you run salmon index under `/usr/bin/time` and look at the resources) are less than what should be requested. The differences in the sha256 sums are a bit strange and I don't have a great explanation for them. One difference is that I built with the head of the develop branch (which has version tag 1.3.1). That describes a difference in `versionInfo.json` but nothing upstream in the index building should have changed, so I am not sure why the other files would have different sha256 sums. I can try with the pre-compiled binary and see if my results match yours. In the meantime, please keep me posted. If index building ends up worth for you with a different configuration, it would be good to check this off of our list of TODOs, and if not, it would be good to get to the bottom of it.

Modifiability,"Hi Mohsen and Rob,. So sorry if you've already been troubleshooting the example data I gave you. I realized that that is not a good example of the problem. In this example, there are snR40 and snR40_genomic transcripts, representing processed and pre-processed isoforms. However, it just so happens that there is residual adapter on some of the reads I provided and the first nucleotide of the adapter sequence actually matches the first nucleotide of the longer, genomic version of this transcript, therefore, the genomic variant gets a slightly better alignment score, as it should. After hard trimming any residual adapter the results for this transcript were a lot better (although still not quite the ratio I would expect). I have quite a few examples like this and I'm fairly sure they are not *all* explained by alignment of adapter sequences. However, I just wanted to let you know in case you were already troubleshooting my example data. I'm aggregating a handful more general examples of the same problem, but ones without a trivial solution like the one I provided.

Modifiability,"Hi Nate,. Can you tell me / do you know how boost was compiled? The error you're getting looks like what happens when the version of boost against which salmon is attempting to link was not built with >= C++11. Basically, the newest version of salmon requires C++14 (which GCC 8 obviously supports). However, there are binary incompatibilities between pre-C++11 and post-C++11 code libraries. So, whatever version of boost you link against must have been compiled with at least `--std=c++11`. One option is to let salmon fetch and build boost for you by putting `-DFETCH_BOOST=TRUE` in the cmake configuration flags when calling `cmake`.

Modifiability,"Hi Rob & Team, . First and foremost, my thanks for developing such a great and versatile tool, very grateful for your work. . I'm hoping for some words of wisdom. We've got some data from Lexogen CORALL libraries (parired end + UMI). One of the main benefits in using this kit, is the lack of fragmentation step, instead there is Displacement Stop Primers (DSP) which are theoretically randomly distributed. . One approach we've taken is to trim adapters, and collapse UMIs (from STAR alignment). Following these steps, we've got theoretically clean data, so using `samtools fastq` to make a Salmon-friendly input. We observed a very unusual fragment length distribution with this, it looks largely poisson. I've rationalised this as the fragments being particularly short after UMI + Adaptor trimming, and given the random nature of DSPs, this could make some sense. One thing that stuck out in my mind was ordering of the reads (which were coord sorted), thus they'd be coming into salmon that way, breaking an assumption of the streaming EM algorithm. . We're currently name sorting the reads prior to Salmon quantification, but I wonder if you could explain if this unusual FLD could be a consequence of position sorted fastq, or any other thoughts you have around this situation? The good news is that ultimately, the same high level biology comes out of the quantifications whichever way do it. . Thanks for any insight.

Modifiability,"Hi,. I am using Salmon v 1.10.1 do perform selective alignment on paired end RNAseq samples and I have trouble to interpret the output statistics (i.e succesfully mapped pairs ....); Here is my command line on a sample containing 34,462,097 pairs (After cleaning, adapter removal, rRNA trimming). **salmon quant -i $IndexDir -l A -1 $forward -2 $reverse -p 8 --seqBias --gcBias –useVBOpt --discardOrphansQuasi –consensusSlack 0.35 --minScoreFraction 0.8 --decoyThreshold 1 -o $OutputDir/$pairname_Output**. Here is the the output statistics of the alignment; [Salmon_quant_output.txt](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/files/11768911/Salmon_quant_output.txt). So I have few questions : . 1- Where is idicated the numer of processed pairs, i.e. the number of pairs in the sample ?. 2- Does the mapping rate correspond to the reads that will be used for the quantification (i.e. succesfully mapped and that were above every filtering thresholds) or this % also takes into account the discarded mapping ? This is of great importance to tell if the mapping step is good or not. 3- Counted 20,588,460 total reads in the equivalence classes What does this mean ? Is it the numner of pairs that mapped (discarded and not discarded or only the ones that are kept for quentification). 4- What is the difference between mapping discarded and fragment discarded ? To count the number if pairs that did not map to my reference should I sum Number of mappings discarded because of alignment score + Number of fragments entirely discarded because of alignment score + Number of fragments discarded because they are best-mapped to decoys + Number of fragments discarded because they have only dovetail (discordant) mappings to valid targets.

Modifiability,"Hi,; I was skimming through some of the code and other open issues on support for other library (cell barcode/umi) designs. It looks like there is code for supporting inDrop libraries, but I wasn't sure which parameters I'd need to set. I have inDrop v2 libraries that I'd like to process and am just trying to figure out if we'll need to write our own extensions or if there is already code in place that we can test. Related to some of the comments about the best model for UMI correction in #269 ; The inDrop (at least the v2 protocol) is based on the CEL-Seq like chemistry -- which uses (in vitro transcription) IVT for the initial amplification rather than PCR. From what I've seen so far, the 2 main flavors of single cell RNA-Seq library construction chemistry are; 1. CelSeq/inDrop; polyA capture -> Reverse transcription (RT) for 1st strand cDNA synthesis -> 2nd strand synthesis -> IVT (linear) amplification -> fragmentation -> RT again to convert back to cDNA -> final PCR to amplify library and add Illumina adapters. 2. DropSeq/10X; polyA capture -> RT with template switching -> PCR amplification of cDNA -> fragmentation followed by variable library construction (either transposon/Nextera based or more traditional --frag, end repair, a-tail and adapter ligation) -> final PCR to amplify library and add Illumina adapters.

Modifiability,"I think your first suggestion would be the best option - although not sure you want worm transcripts in your decoy file. An alternative is to just quantify the entire collection of sequences. This is what [our pipeline](https://github.com/Novartis/pisces) does. This mostly just consists of running salmon plus some functionality for building custom index files and splitting output for multi-species analysis. You can specify your GTF/FASTA pairs using a [config file](https://github.com/Novartis/pisces/blob/9936079ac75d4b75be95bad5bc962465e8c5f458/pisces/config.json#L46-L49) and the pipeline builds index files, helps run salmon and some basic QC, and outputs separate expression matrices for each individual organism - normalized back to TPM space.

For k=1, we had `edit_cost = 8` leading to automatic setting of `minScoreFraction` of 0.797619.; we have looked at 15 length barcodes, but it's possible longer barcodes might have more sequencing error.

Modifiability,"Thank you @rob-p for commenting, I presumed that could be the case for reads from unspliced pre-mRNAs that are even extending a small fraction into the introns (hence better scoring on the decoys). The 2 FASTQ files for one of the samples I was describing above can be found as R4171*.fastq.gz at this globus link: http://research.libd.org/globus/jhpce_bsp2-dlpfc/index.html. I used just the main chromosomes with Gencode v41 annotation (slightly ""curated"" to remove read-through and ""retained intron"" annotated transcripts). I am attaching 3 `meta_info.json` outputs for the 3 ways I ran salmon on this sample:. - [tx_only.meta_info.json.gz](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/files/11006627/tx_only.meta_info.json.gz) : no decoys, **without** `--validateMappings`; - [gentrome_full.meta_info.json.gz](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/files/11006628/gentrome_full.meta_info.json.gz) : with `--validateMappings`, decoys are full chromosome sequences appended to the transcripts file, ; - [gentrome_mashed.meta_info.json.gz](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/files/11006629/gentrome_mashed.meta_info.json.gz) : with `--validateMappings`, decoys prepared with mashmap as instructed [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/blob/master/README.md). It would be great to be able to use Salmon's ""wicked fast"" mapping engine to estimate intronic and intergenic reads at the same time, so I'm considering to make better use of the `writeMappings` output for that purpose, by preparing the decoys in a specific way (extracting intronic and intergenic sequences as distinctively labeled decoys and count the mappings to each label from Salmon's SAM output -- would that work?). I am wondering, due to pre-mRNAs found in rRNA-depletion (ribo-zero) samples, it might be better to artifically add the unspliced transcripts into the mix along with the ""reference"" annotation transcripts, so they also get quantified during the EM-guided probabilistic distribution of reads across this mix of p",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/779#issuecomment-1474451463:116,extend,extending,116,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/779#issuecomment-1474451463,2,['extend'],['extending']

Modifiability,"Thanks @mikelove . I believe tximeta can be used only for human/mouse? In my case, it is not human/mouse. @rob-p and @mikelove - Based on my reading of the salmon documentation, isn't it that the NumReads/TPM etc made available after lengthCorrection. Extending this, the NumReads in quant.sf corresponds to the estimated count value for each transcript and correlated by effective length. My idea is to therefore use the countsFromAbundance=“lengthScaledTPM” to compute counts that are on the same scale as original counts and not correlated with transcript length across samples. Given this - Is this below also valid (after salmon quant). ```; salmon_tx2gene_data = tximport(files, type=""salmon"", tx2gene=tx2gene,; countsFromAbundance = ""lengthScaledTPM""). # generate CSV for archival/use-for-other-purposes ; # then read in the csv and use with DESeq. write.csv(as.data.frame(salmon_tx2gene_data$counts),; file = ""lengthScaledTPM_tx2gene_counts.csv""). # other code for reading in csv, design_metadata etc. dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix (countData = salmon_tx2gene_data$counts,; colData = coldata, ~ condition). ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/581#issuecomment-719784814:252,Extend,Extending,252,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/581#issuecomment-719784814,1,['Extend'],['Extending']
Modifiability,"Thanks @rob-p,. Your explanations are helpful, and I think it may my concern may just be more associated with your general thought as I've tested this with multiple parameters. The one I represented here was just an example, but I also can see how the parameters can be affecting these results. It was just strange to see such a huge shift with the addition/removal of one gene, which makes me think it more associated with how the inference of the variables are conditioned. . As for providing the meta_info.json files, I currently have thousands of them as I am running triplicates of ~150 parameter combinations for multiple tissue types and stages. In the end I don't think it will be necessary as we will likely be changing our approach a bit, which should be fine with the system I have in place. . Also, as for `--scoreExp` our main goal is to try and use Salmon to get quantification of individual genes (primary versus spliced forms). From my analysis, it appears that some genes perform better with scores > 0, however, some genes do perform better with a `--scoreExp` of 0. Although, this could be a factor in running Salmon with such a narrow view (i.e. two transcripts and some housekeeping genes) and might not be the case as more genes are added to the run.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/523#issuecomment-633062608:449,variab,variables,449,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/523#issuecomment-633062608,1,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"Thanks for the recommendation. I'll definitely take a look at it. It is true that we typically suggest that you drop singletons if they are created during e.g. adapter / quality trimming etc.. However, it is also the case that one really may only want to consider very ""light"" quality trimming for RNA-seq data [as suggested by Matt MacManes](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2014.00013/full). . If the trimming leads to the loss of a large number of reads, my initial reaction would be to try an understand why. One could always ""re-synchronize"" the singletons by providing them with fake mates, which would cause them to be mapped and treated as orphans during quantification. However, again, it's probably worth understanding why an experiment ends up with a lot of singletons before going through the trouble of accounting for them.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/240#issuecomment-400061755:160,adapt,adapter,160,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/240#issuecomment-400061755,1,['adapt'],['adapter']

Modifiability,"There should be easy ways to handle reading line-buffered input from two file descriptors, where both file descriptors could be identical, and then passing these streams internally to buffers to be chunked for multithreaded processing. This would give you one code path for ingesting data, and the command line interface could remain the same as it is currently, with the possible addition of mapping the `-` symbol to `/dev/fd/0`. Is there really much to be gained from buffering all input in byte chunks up front? Remembering that unix pipes are buffered somewhat by default anyway? There has to be an acceptable way to handle line-based input in a more flexible way. In Python I would do:. ``` python; import argparse. example_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(); example_parser.add_argument('-fq1', type=argparse.FileType('r')); example_parser.add_argument('-fq2', type=argparse.FileType('r')); args = parser.parse_args(). for line1, line2 in zip(args.fq1, args.fq2):; do_stuff_with_lines(); ```. You could then call the program flexibly:. ``` bash; $ example -fq1 file1.fq -fq2 file2.fq; $ example -fq1 <(gzip -dc file1.fq.gz) -fq2 <(gzip -dc file2.fq.gz); $ other_interleaved_process | example -fq1 - -fq2 -; ```. The caveat for the code above is that you would want to replace `argparse.FileType` with some class that reads 4 lines at a time - I'm sure there's no shortage of Python FASTQ readers that do that. And I know that you're looking for C++ libraries that perform well for your purposes, and my Python example is just a toy, but I think designing the option parser to at least **accept** streams and file-like objects and handle them using the same code path would be a worthy reason to refactor a bit.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/29#issuecomment-168545456:656,flexible,flexible,656,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/29#issuecomment-168545456,2,"['flexible', 'refactor']","['flexible', 'refactor']"
Modifiability,"This PR introduces a new feature that will allow users to specify custom single cell protocols and use with alevin. Custom Geometry (--custom-geo) should be used when:; 1. Barcode or umi have variable lengths; 2. There is known fixed sequence in the reads; 3. There is some sequence to be excluded; From the input peglib spec it creates a regex. Boost regex library is used to parse the reads. Apart from small tests on multiple outlier cases, it was tested on a sci-RNA-seq3 sample SRR7827207 for speed. For this the spec is `--custom-geo 1{b[9-10]f[CAGAGC]u[8]b[10]}2{r}`. It says:; - Read 1 starts with barcode of variable length 9-10 bp, followed by; - A fixed sequence CAGAGC, then; - A umi of length 8, and lastly; - barcode of length 10.; - The second read is all biological. The barcodes are concatenated in the output and a padding sequence is added to make the length as max length + 1. The extra base is added so that we don't introduce spurious matches in barcode. For example, if the barcodes have length 3-4 bp and the two barcodes are `ATG` and `ATGA`, after padding they will be `ATGAC` and `ATGAA` resp. Adding just `A` to shorter barcode would result in a spurious match. . Since `--custom-geo` uses regex, it is slower than protocol specific flag.

Using `--custom-geo`; ```; real 1m39.887s; user 11m55.602s; sys 0m6.839s; ```; Notably, it is about 66% slower. However, it allows support for almost all current and future protocols. . There will be a tutorial shortly on how and when to use this and how is it different from other flags such as `--umi-geometry`, `--read-geometry` and `--bc-geomtery`.

Notes:; * I added `gcc-5`'s case as maybe it is minimal support version of gcc for this project.; * I want to replace current case `gcc-7` to latest version `gcc-8` if you like.; * Total running time (""Ran for"" on the Travis page.) becomes faster than current situation. In my repository, total running time is ""15 min 11 sec"", seeing current master branch's test is around 17 min+. See [1]; * Removed `travis_wait`. Without the command, the default behavior is ""when a long running command or compile step regularly takes longer than 10 minutes without producing any output"". [2] I have not faced the situation when I did debug. ; * There are commented out area at the bottom of `.travis.yml`. However as we can run `git log -p .travis.yml` to check past modification, shall we remove the commented out ""whitelist"" area?.

Modifiability,"This pull-request is for develop branch.; This fixes https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/275 . The reason of the build error was because b2 was always built with ""gcc"".; I added something like below code. ```; echo ""using gcc : ${CC_VERSION} : ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER} ;"" > ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/external/boost_1_66_0/tools/build/src/user-config.jam. /path/to/b2 .. toolset=${CC} ...; ```; ; There are still challenges to fix it. 1. The `make test` was finished with timeout. When setting `travis_wait 30 make test`, still failed with the timeout. Maybe we need to change the unit test logic to output something (log or progress bar) regularly to `stdout` during the test process or change the test logic itself. It is freezing at the below point. ```; /usr/local/cmake-3.9.2/bin/ctest --force-new-ctest-process ; Test project /home/travis/build/junaruga/salmon/build; Start 1: unit_tests; ```. 2. The `b2` parameter string `toolset=gcc-7 cxxflags=-std=c++14` is duplicated like this. Maybe we can change the logic in `CMakeLists.txt`. ```; CC=/usr/bin/gcc-7 CXX=/usr/bin/g++-7 /home/travis/build/junaruga/salmon/external/boost_1_66_0/b2 -d0 -j2 --with-iostreams --with-atomic --with-chrono --with-container --with-date_time --with-exception --with-filesystem --with-graph --with-graph_parallel --with-math --with-program_options --with-system --with-locale --with-timer toolset=gcc-7 toolset=gcc-7 cxxflags=-std=c++14 ""cxxflags= -std=c++14 -I/home/travis/build/junaruga/salmon/external/install/include -L/home/travis/build/junaruga/salmon/external/install/lib"" link=static install; ```. 3. `CMakeLists.txt` and `cmake/*.cmake` have a mixture of the different code formatting style. Aligning for formatting those make us read the files easier. I found the useful information for that. [1][2][3][4].; * 2 or 4 space indent?; * ""Tab"" indent is unintentionally used maybe.; * `set(...)` or `set (...)`.; * `set or SET`.

Have you ever encountered something like this or could address me to where the issue may be (I'm assuming something to do with the bootstrap)?. *****Script I submit:*****; ```; #!/bin/bash; # expected run time ; #SBATCH --time=24:00:00 ; # Combine stderr and stdout log files into the stdout log file.; #SBATCH -o without -e; # Keep current environment variables.; #SBATCH --export=variables; # number of cores; #SBATCH -n 30; # expected memory to be used; #SBATCH —mem=50000; # Specify queue via expected length of job. ; #SBATCH --partition=medium; # Set the log directory.; #SBATCH -o logs. ####declarations; conda activate salmon.

Modifiability,"comment-777414), but I'm currently attempting to extend alevin's use to the newer combinatorial indexing experiments like [SPLiT-seq](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/176) or the commercial solution, [ParseBio](https://www.parsebiosciences.com/) (the biotech formerly known as SplitBio). Now that you support different barcode geometries and allow the user to specify where these barcodes should be expected, this _should_ be doable. . I've downloaded the [raw data from the original SPLiT-seq paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM3017261), and we have some ParseBio data of our own; my goal is to help you all write a vignette on this once we get the details worked out. . In short, the R1 file contains cDNA sequence, and R2 contains a 10bp UMI followed by 3 different barcodes in the following arrangements (note: ParseBio seems to shift BC1 up a few bp, to 79-86):; - UMI: 1-10; - BC3: 11-18; - BC2: 49-56; - BC1: 87-94. The intervening bases are a combination of common and variable sequences. The other wrinkle with these approaches is that the cDNA can be amplified using either oligo-dT or random hexamer barcodes. The net effect of this is that BC1 can be one of two options, and some barcode combinations need to be pooled to represent the same cell. For example:. AACGTGAT-CTGTAGCC-ACACAGAA; GATAGACA-CTGTAGCC-ACACAGAA. may be the same cell, amplified by two different means. . We know how the BC1s are paired, so Avi suggested pre-processing the R2 FASTQ file such that we locate random hexamer BC1 sequences and modify them to the matched oligo-dT sequence. In the above example, we'd correct some R2 reads that contain ""GATAGACA"" in the 87-94 position to ""AACGTGAT"". I [wrote a script](https://github.com/jeremymsimon/SPLITseq) (in perl because I'm old-school) that does this and allows for mismatches within 1 hamming distance.

Modifiability,"e *full* decoy index is substantially larger than the index on just the transcriptome (after all, it is indexing the entire human genome in addition to the transcriptome). One thing you might try to test this hypothesis, other than requesting to build on a node with more RAM, is to compute a hash (e.g. md5 or sha256 sum) on all of the files in the index, and also record their sizes. Then we can build the index on the same version of the files on our end and compare. Second — and perhaps more importantly for your end goal — the main purpose of the decoy-aware index is to improve specificity rather than sensitivity. That is, the decoys are designed to help avoid _spurious_ mapping of reads to an annotated transcript when a better explanation for the read exists elsewhere in the genome. However, the reads that are mapped to decoys are not otherwise used for quantification. Thus, using the decoy aware transcriptome index is unlikely to improve your mapping rate. I agree that your mapping rate does seem rather low. There are a few potential culprits here, and some diagnostics we can look at to see what might be going wrong. First, you can take a look at the file `aux_info/meta_info.json` in the salmon quantification directories to get a few more details about why reads were not mapped. If you share one of those files here I can describe the relevant fields. Also, I have two more rather common things to consider that might affect the mapping rate. One is to add the sequence for the ribosomal RNAs to your transcriptome before indexing and then quantifying. If your mapping rate increases considerably, this is evidence of rather inefficient depletion prior to sequencing.

Modifiability,"e I answer your question and layout my logic, I want to mention that I am **_not_** suggesting fastp is not doing its job, **_neither am I stating that fastp is working incorrectly_**. Now to my answer(s) and logic:; 1. With fastp, I am not sure if adapter trimming happens first and then quality trimming OR vice-versa. I could not find info on this from their README and **_I could be wrong here with my next line_** - [Based on Figure 1 of this paper, it looks to me as though quality trimming is done before adapter trimming](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6129281/figure/bty560-F1/). - [To quote Brian Bushnell (author of BBTools)]( http://seqanswers.com/forums/showpost.php?p=140819&postcount=5), . > It's best to do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming, because if you do quality-trimming first, sometimes adapters will be partially trimmed and become too short to be recognized as adapter sequence. When you run BBDuk with both quality-trimming and adapter-trimming in the same run, it will do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming. 2. I very well know that the advantage of using fastp is that it can do adapter trimming, etc in a automatic fashion - no need to provide external sequences (example adapter sequences). Yes, I know one can also provide a fasta file of adapters and fatsp will work off it. There are many fatsp issues in GH about adapter detection:. - fail to detect adpaters automatically - (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/222 and https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/205). - [incorrect automatic adapter detection](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/240). - [inconsistent behavior with different runs](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/231). 3. When I see the above, I am bit skeptical using fastp for qc/adapter trimming. . After lot of trials with bbduk and fastp, I have decided to use bbduk and bbmap for my high throughput analysis. Below, I explain my reasoning behind those choices: . **_```Note - edited this ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/485#issuecomment-597393209:997,adapt,adapter-trimming,997,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/485#issuecomment-597393209,4,['adapt'],['adapter-trimming']

I chose the above command line options (`especially --noLengthCorrection`) based on [Rob's message here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sailfish-users/VIfqBwgF6xQ/fw-rgC_kAwAJ) and a [thread here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/108). Let me elaborate the big picture of my analyses and give more details about how I came up with the mapping numbers in my original post. Big Picture - DEG identification for samples sequenced by ILMN (whole transcript method) and QS (3' method) - [something similar to this paper](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-018-5393-3). Bioinformatics Pipeline(s) for both ILMN and QS :. 1. HISAT Method : Adapter/Quality Trimming, Hisat2-HTSEQ, Get_Count_Table, DESeq; 2. STAR_RSEM Method: Adapter/Quality Trimming, STAR_RSEM, Get_Count_Table, DESeq; 3. SAF Method: Adapter/Quality Trimming, SAF_SALMON, Get_Count_Table, DESeq; 4. Quasi-Mapping or TXOME Method: Adapter/Quality Trimming, TXOME_SALMON, Get_Count_Table, DESeq. I used UpSetR plots for comparisons of sets of DEGs from each method just [as you have shown in your recent preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v1.full). In the ILMN analyses, there is great concordance between the SAF method and HISAT/STAR_RSEM method. However, in the QS analyses, there is very limited concordance between SAF and the HISAT/STAR_RSEM method. For QS analyses, the TXOME method shows great concordance with HISAT/STAR_RSEM. This finding made me wonder if this has to be something with my salmon quant command line options for QS. Therefore, I wanted to check how the QS expected counts for SAF method show up for all samples in my final summarized table (after tximpo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/449#issuecomment-554768195:1016,Adapt,Adapter,1016,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/449#issuecomment-554768195,1,['Adapt'],['Adapter']

Modifiability,"efault. RSEM uses the EM algorithm, and salmon uses the variational Bayesian EM algorithm. The latter tends to induce more sparse solutions. This is simply because they are optimizing slightly different objectives. It is very difficult to say in general if one is ""better"" than the other in a blanket way, but [there is previous literature to support that the VBEM may be more accurate](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/29/18/2292/239795). However, while RSEM only implements the EM algorithm, salmon actually implements and provides a switch to use either. So, if you want to test the effect of this difference, you can run salmon with the `--useEM` algorithm. This will tell salmon to use the ""classic"" EM algorithm and will eliminate this source of variation. * As with the other question you asked, there may be a _small_ discrepancy depending on when enforcement of a stranded library kicks in under salmon's `A` library type. You can eliminate that variable by simply providing `-l SF` to match the library type being used with RSEM. * Coming back to the `IndelSoftclipSingleend` parameter I mentioned in the first point; RSEM disallows indels in the alignments that it quantifies. This means that to produce RSEM-compatible input, STAR must not align reads that contain indels. While this won't generally have a big effect for many transcripts, it can certainly affect the abundance estimates for transcripts in your sample where the sample you are quantifying has (indel) variation with respect to the reference annotation. We touch upon that a bit as well in the [paper I mentioned above](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02151-8). * Finally, and likely the smallest source of potential differences, is that there are other implementation details that differ between salmon and RSEM (e.g. exactly how the fragment length distribution is used to compute the effective transcript length, exactly how the alignment score of a read is used to as",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/612#issuecomment-758004590:3660,variab,variable,3660,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/612#issuecomment-758004590,2,['variab'],['variable']

I think this may be a versioning issue related to what types of objects can be added into layers (aka slots) in a Seurat object. For reference, here are some details of the objects involved:; ```; > class(brain); [1] ""Seurat""; attr(,""package""); [1] ""SeuratObject""; > class(image.data); [1] ""VisiumV2""; attr(,""package""); [1] ""Seurat""; ```. It is worth noting that I installed Salmon using the docker image found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/combinelab/salmon) approximately three months ago. The version number I see is `1.10.3`. Below is my sessionInfo output as well. My best guess is that I have to adjust the object type for `image.data` here to something that can be coerced into a slot in the `brain` Seurat object, but I am not sure what object that should be. Let me know if I am making a simple mistake here too, I am quite rusty with the nuances of R.

Modifiability,"here, for instance. What do the flags and qualities represent?. It is just a SAM file without CIGAR strings. The flags have the same (normal) interpretation for SAM records. However the CIGAR strings are not meaningful (apart from what is required for the file to undergo valid processing with samtools). The records additionally contain tags about the number of targets to which a fragment multi-maps, and the alignment score of the read pair to the current target (in the `AS` flag). The records themself are just normal SAM records, but with a trivial CIGAR strong. > More importantly, is there a way to filter the pseudobam files to find the reads corresponding to the counts/NumReads in the quant.sf output file? Do the normal samtools quality and flag filters work to subset e.g. uniquely-mapped reads, or do those concepts not really apply to these pseudobams?. There is no easy way to filter so the above condition is satisfied, as the NumReads are obtained by proportional allocation of the reads according to the underlying probabilistic model of salmon. Specifically, the NumReads column of the quantification file corresponds to summing over the _expectation_ of all of the latent variables that represent fragment to transcript assignment so that, apart from uniquely-mapped reads, there is no way to say that a fragment _definitely_ came from a transcript. However, you should still be able to easily filter out uniquely mapped reads, and you can interpret them in a relatively unambiguous way. Also, you could filter on the `AS` tag as well. For a given read, if there is a single transcript where the `AS` value is much larger than the others for this read, it is overwhelmingly likely that the read originated from the transcript with the unique best `AS` score. @shangguandong1996 : The SAM file _does_ contain positions (and orientations, and alignment scores) for each read. It is simply that the positions are with respect to the transcriptome and not with respect to the genome.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/528#issuecomment-639065653:2438,variab,variables,2438,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/528#issuecomment-639065653,2,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"ing incorrectly_**. Now to my answer(s) and logic:; 1. With fastp, I am not sure if adapter trimming happens first and then quality trimming OR vice-versa. I could not find info on this from their README and **_I could be wrong here with my next line_** - [Based on Figure 1 of this paper, it looks to me as though quality trimming is done before adapter trimming](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6129281/figure/bty560-F1/). - [To quote Brian Bushnell (author of BBTools)]( http://seqanswers.com/forums/showpost.php?p=140819&postcount=5), . > It's best to do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming, because if you do quality-trimming first, sometimes adapters will be partially trimmed and become too short to be recognized as adapter sequence. When you run BBDuk with both quality-trimming and adapter-trimming in the same run, it will do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming. 2. I very well know that the advantage of using fastp is that it can do adapter trimming, etc in a automatic fashion - no need to provide external sequences (example adapter sequences). Yes, I know one can also provide a fasta file of adapters and fatsp will work off it. There are many fatsp issues in GH about adapter detection:. - fail to detect adpaters automatically - (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/222 and https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/205). - [incorrect automatic adapter detection](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/240). - [inconsistent behavior with different runs](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/231). 3. When I see the above, I am bit skeptical using fastp for qc/adapter trimming. . After lot of trials with bbduk and fastp, I have decided to use bbduk and bbmap for my high throughput analysis. Below, I explain my reasoning behind those choices: . **_```Note - edited this on 02-Apr-2020 to have the correct order of operations ```_** . 1. **_STEP 1 - run bbmap.sh on raw fatsq file to remove contaminants as appropriate (rRNA, mitochondri",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/485#issuecomment-597393209:1161,adapt,adapter,1161,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/485#issuecomment-597393209,4,['adapt'],['adapter']

Modifiability,"inly does seem very low. To answer your specific questions first:; 1) I'm not sure --- let's try tor find out; 2) I don't think so (if they are part of your index, they should be aligned against); 3) If there are many transcripts / targets you expect to be sequenced but which aren't present in this set, that can affect the mapping rate, but not likely to take it down to 6%. Here are the things I'd investigate --- roughly in order: . 1) In addition to the fraction of reads STAR mapped (which you report above), what fraction of the reads are assigned to features by featureCounts? In some cases, when there is a failure of rRNA depletion of polyA selection, you can end up with an experiment where most of the sequenced RNA comes from rRNA not present in the reference transcriptome. In this case, STAR will be able to align the reads to the genome, but you won't see these reads mapping to annotated features (and you also won't see them showing up in your transcript level quantifications). So, it may be worth to take a look at the count of reads assigned to the feature set of genes by featureCounts. 2) Above, it looks like a considerable number of fragments were discarded due to no alignment reaching the required alignment score (`11,448,458` fragments discarded because of this). Have you tried to adapter / quality trim the data? Does this have any effect on the mapping rate?. 3) If the above don't reveal any clues, I'd be happy to try to take a look at the data if you can share it. I'd be quite surprised if STAR is aligning a lot of reads *to transcriptome features* that are being missed by salmon. Nonetheless, if you pass the proper flags to STAR (including `--quantMode TranscriptomeSAM`), then you can use the SAM/BAM file generated by STAR to perform quantification with salmon (i.e. use STAR's alignments to do _transcript-level_ quantification). I'd be happy to help dig further on any of these, so please feel free to reach out if you find anything interesting.

I could not find info on this from their README and **_I could be wrong here with my next line_** - [Based on Figure 1 of this paper, it looks to me as though quality trimming is done before adapter trimming](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6129281/figure/bty560-F1/). - [To quote Brian Bushnell (author of BBTools)]( http://seqanswers.com/forums/showpost.php?p=140819&postcount=5), . > It's best to do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming, because if you do quality-trimming first, sometimes adapters will be partially trimmed and become too short to be recognized as adapter sequence. When you run BBDuk with both quality-trimming and adapter-trimming in the same run, it will do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming. 2. I very well know that the advantage of using fastp is that it can do adapter trimming, etc in a automatic fashion - no need to provide external sequences (example adapter sequences). Yes, I know one can also provide a fasta file of adapters and fatsp will work off it. There are many fatsp issues in GH about adapter detection:. - fail to detect adpaters automatically - (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/222 and https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/205). - [incorrect automatic adapter detection](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/240). - [inconsistent behavior with different runs](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/231). 3.

Modifiability,"nt-697125235) in other mapping issue reports, it's possible that there could be multiple fragments in those numbers that contribute to a single read, meaning the unaccounted number is probably higher:. > The number you are looking at is the number of discarded mappings, not the number of discarded fragments. The difference is that every fragment can have many potential mappings. The number you are looking at is the total number of attempted alignments that failed to achieve the threshold score. Luckily, salmon reports both numbers. The number of fragments for which all alignments failed to reach the score threshold is 4,196,417; given in aux_info.json by ""num_fragments_filtered_vm"": 4196417. One point to note is that these are all fragments for which mapping is attempted (they had at least one k-mer match the reference), but no alignment was valid up to the threshold. You could try running the quantification again with --softclip to allow softclipping of the reads and see if any considerable fraction of these 4196417 failed to align because they overhang the annotated transcripts or contain adapters etc. Nonetheless, even if all of these mapped, the rate would still be ~72%. The remainder of the reads didn't even have a matching k-mer in common with the reference transcriptome, which means they are exceedingly unlikely to have come from the transcripts that were indexed. Further explanation of what these metadata numbers mean would be very helpful to me. Also useful would be a statistic (or more than one statistic) that fully categorises the read alignments or non-alignments. **Desktop (please complete the following information):**; - OS: Debian; - `uname-a`: Linux musculus 6.7.9-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.7.9-2 (2024-03-13) x86_64 GNU/Linux; - `lsb_release -a`; ```; No LSB modules are available.; Distributor ID: Debian; Description: Debian GNU/Linux trixie/sid; Release: n/a; Codename: trixie; ```. **Additional context**.

Modifiability,"quality-trimming, because if you do quality-trimming first, sometimes adapters will be partially trimmed and become too short to be recognized as adapter sequence. When you run BBDuk with both quality-trimming and adapter-trimming in the same run, it will do adapter-trimming first, then quality-trimming. 2. I very well know that the advantage of using fastp is that it can do adapter trimming, etc in a automatic fashion - no need to provide external sequences (example adapter sequences). Yes, I know one can also provide a fasta file of adapters and fatsp will work off it. There are many fatsp issues in GH about adapter detection:. - fail to detect adpaters automatically - (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/222 and https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/205). - [incorrect automatic adapter detection](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/240). - [inconsistent behavior with different runs](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/231). 3.

Modifiability,"ranscriptome (with no decoys) gives me a mapping rate of `0.00378202832148367%`. The first thing I did was to quality and adapter trim the data (using `fastp -i SRR9007475.fastq.gz -o SRR9007475_trimmed.fastq.gz -q 10 -w 8`) and ... whoa. This is the fastp html report [fastp.html.zip](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/files/4176345/fastp.html.zip). So the first astounding statistic, the mean read length before trimming is 51bp (these are relatively short single-end reads). The mean read length after trimming is 21bp! So, the average read length is, in fact, less than the k-mer length used for indexing (default is k=31). On the trimmed data, the mapping rate goes up to `2.3545475882931305%`, still very low, but now there's somewhat of an explanation, the average read is shorter than a single k-mer. So, the next thing I tried was indexing with a smaller k; a _really_ small one in this case,`k=15`. Then, I re-ran on the _trimmed_ reads (the fact that the trimming took us from 51-21bp suggests that the reads had a lot of low quality bases, adapter contamination, or both). Under this setting, I still get a very low mapping rate, but it was _much_ higher — `16.766993524863488%`. The final thing I tried was seeing how the mapping rate changed as I altered `--minScoreFraction`, which is the salmon parameter that determines the alignment score that a read must achieve in order to be mapped validly. The default is 0.65. This means that the read cannot have a score < 0.65 * the maximum achievable score for the read given it's length. In the case of a 21bp read, the best score would be a score of 42, so a read must obtain a score >= 27 in order to be mapped. This is already a pretty poor mapping, but I reduced it even more to 0.3 (so any read with a score > 12 would pass). This led to a mapping rate of `~46%`. However, at this point, I'm not sure I would be confident in such mappings. For example, the situation here would be a 21bp read with multiple mismatches and, much of",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/482#issuecomment-583799668:1452,adapt,adapter,1452,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/482#issuecomment-583799668,1,['adapt'],['adapter']

Quasi-Mapping or TXOME Method: Adapter/Quality Trimming, TXOME_SALMON, Get_Count_Table, DESeq. I used UpSetR plots for comparisons of sets of DEGs from each method just [as you have shown in your recent preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v1.full). In the ILMN analyses, there is great concordance between the SAF method and HISAT/STAR_RSEM method. However, in the QS analyses, there is very limited concordance between SAF and the HISAT/STAR_RSEM method. For QS analyses, the TXOME method shows great concordance with HISAT/STAR_RSEM. This finding made me wonder if this has to be something with my salmon quant command line options for QS. Therefore, I wanted to check how the QS expected counts for SAF method show up for all samples in my final summarized table (after tximport). I got a colSum for all my samples and then checked the numbers for the transc",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/449#issuecomment-554768195:1101,Adapt,Adapter,1101,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/449#issuecomment-554768195,1,['Adapt'],['Adapter']

Modifiability,"ssue and comments therein](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/489)). The second and more fundamental thing going on is that the observed behavior is intended. Even with a single thread of execution provided to salmon for mapping and quantification, there is a separate background thread that simply consumes reads from file and puts them in memory for quantification, and while e.g. pairing information between files is guaranteed to be preserved, exact read order is not. This can lead to differences in the order in which reads are processed and, as a result, differences in the initialization conditions of the optimization. The ultimate result is that for transcripts that have large inferential uncertainty, different numbers of reads can be assigned between runs. We have thought *a lot* about this behavior, what it means, and how the `NumRead` values should best be communicated to users. At the end of the day, the `NumReads` constitute the expected value of latent variables inferred in a _very_ high-dimensional space (# of parameters is at least the number of transcripts). Therefore, there are certain transcripts, whose estimated number of reads simply have _tremendous_ inferential uncertainty — and small perturbations in the initial conditions of the optimization will lead to different estimated values for their abundances. For those transcripts where you observe such fluctuations between runs, this is simply evidence that the precision that can be confidently placed on those estimates is below the degree of variation you observe. Treating these transcripts in downstream analysis as more certain can easily lead to spurious inferences regarding things like differential transcript expression or usage. . One can make an argument for trying to provide a way to enforce removal of this variation (which, granted, would be a challenge). However, the reason we decided against even attempting this is because it doesn't properly address any issue with respect to an actua",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/613#issuecomment-757989858:1568,variab,variables,1568,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/613#issuecomment-757989858,2,['variab'],['variables']

Performance," BAM Unsorted --quantMode TranscriptomeSAM --outSAMattributes NH HI AS NM MD --quantTranscriptomeBan IndelSoftclipSingleend`; note that last parameter that I will come back to later. Also, the paper referenced above also describes a new capability present in recent versions of salmon that allow it to index the entire genome (as well as the transcriptome) to have the former act as a decoy. This allows avoiding what might otherwise be spurious mappings that result when one considers only the transcriptome as a source of mapping. There are a number of ways to proceed on this front, but this is a good place to first check for discrepancy (and the paper gives a good overview of the relative tradeoffs and merits of different alignment approaches). * Salmon and RSEM use related but distinct optimization algorithms by default. RSEM uses the EM algorithm, and salmon uses the variational Bayesian EM algorithm. The latter tends to induce more sparse solutions. This is simply because they are optimizing slightly different objectives. It is very difficult to say in general if one is ""better"" than the other in a blanket way, but [there is previous literature to support that the VBEM may be more accurate](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/29/18/2292/239795). However, while RSEM only implements the EM algorithm, salmon actually implements and provides a switch to use either. So, if you want to test the effect of this difference, you can run salmon with the `--useEM` algorithm. This will tell salmon to use the ""classic"" EM algorithm and will eliminate this source of variation. * As with the other question you asked, there may be a _small_ discrepancy depending on when enforcement of a stranded library kicks in under salmon's `A` library type. You can eliminate that variable by simply providing `-l SF` to match the library type being used with RSEM. * Coming back to the `IndelSoftclipSingleend` parameter I mentioned in the first point; RSEM disallows indels in the align",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/612#issuecomment-758004590:2863,optimiz,optimizing,2863,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/612#issuecomment-758004590,2,['optimiz'],['optimizing']

Performance," I believe I just need to set the parameters right, but I also want to set the parameters in a general way so that my script can work across different species with different input RNAseq data. The other problem is that we currently do not have an idea of what proportion of these two versions of the gene should actually exist in the RNAseq data I have (which we didn't perform but just grabbed a random sample from GenBank to test with). My adviser wants to first try and test it computationally first and then verify it in the lab (which is somewhat backwards in my mind, as it's really just a shot in the dark and from my preliminary analysis of Salmon, different parameters can drastically change the proportions of the two versions). . As you can see below, I have tried some parameter settings that I thought would be helpful (particularly ```--quasiCoverage```). But again I could be wrong and would like to know your opinions in the matter. . These runs were all performed with this 'default' run: ; ```; salmon quant -i index -l A -1 reads_1.fq -2 reads_2.fq --validateMappings -p 20 --numPreAuxModelSamples 250 --numAuxModelSamples 1000 -o output ; ```; I changes the ```AuxModelSamples``` to low values as I was generally only mapping 6000 reads to the two transcripts in total, so I didn't think they were working at the default settings. Below is also a small chart of some of my runs (which included quasi-mapping and selective-alignment), but what you can get is that there is a large variance between parameters. Particularly ```--seqBias``` showed a dramatic drop in predicted T - 2 transcripts. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29610303/61421680-5899aa00-a8c5-11e9-8349-bd708316599d.png). Any suggestions onto parameters settings to help me with this narrow question?. Now onto some questions regarding some outputs. 1.

Performance," Run B. ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/361470/20741292/4f8243a0-b697-11e6-93ae-29d4b48327cd.png). ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/361470/20741299/60f84c1a-b697-11e6-9f83-1554ff471e94.png). So, as you can see, there is a substantial amount of uncertainty in RunA, especially for `MSAD_200218.t1`. This can explain how you see this transcript obtaining different numbers of reads over different executions for Run A. Specifically, the inferential uncertainty for this transcript is high, and though the mean of the posterior is close to the value you report above, the range is quite large (200 - 1200) reads (potentially even larger with more bootstraps, but 100 gives us a reasonable window on posterior variance). On the other hand, the EM algorithm *really* wants to assign ~0.8 reads to `MSAD_157177.t1` in Run B. To test how much this might be the result of the tendency of the EM algorithm toward sparsity, I tried processing both samples with Salmon's `--useVBOpt` flag --- causing it to use the variational bayesian optimization algorithm, which yields considerably more *regularized* estimates. The posterior distributions obtained using the VB optimizer are:. ### Run A (VB Opt). ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/361470/20741629/916b3446-b699-11e6-9f92-b8b6d3519981.png). ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/361470/20741636/98510f06-b699-11e6-8d9f-34f1c353c3e6.png). ### Run B (VB Opt). ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/361470/20741642/a1341686-b699-11e6-9a87-8a30f87cd49c.png). ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/361470/20741645/a7340d5c-b699-11e6-90dd-55f9795bac8f.png). So, while there are some small differences for Run A and transcript `MSAD_200218.t1` in Run B, you can see that the most striking difference is `MSAD_157177.t1` in Run B. The number of estimated reads isn't quite as high as with eXpress, but a considerable number of reads map to `MSAD_157177.t1` (and the ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/107#issuecomment-263793798:1720,optimiz,optimization,1720,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/107#issuecomment-263793798,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Performance," decoys or the organism's genome as a decoy whenever possible. . 4) Related to @k3yavi's response and my elaboration above: we have dropped quasi-mapping from 1.0.0 (though something akin to it may return in the future if there is sufficient demand and if the shortcomings described in the manuscript can be overcome). However, as I mention in part 3 above, this doesn't mean it's not possible to use v1.0.0 without an explicit decoy sequence. The `--decoy` flag of the indexing command is optional, not required. We will update this in the documentation making it more explicit. However, as @k3yavi points out, it is true that if you wish to use quasi-mapping and selective-alignment against the full genome on the same machine, you will need both versions, as quasi-mapping is supported only in the [RapMap](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/RapMap/tree/develop-salmon), while indexing something on the scale of the genome when not using the [pufferfish-based](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish/tree/develop) index has tremendous memory requirements (as is not recommended ). 5 & 6) To re-iterate @k3yavi's answer --- the extra flags used in the pre-print were only for the purpose of holding as many variables fixed as possible when comparing different approaches. It continues to be recommended to use the VBEM over the EM; it seems to perform better with respect to the ways in which we can measure and such improvements have also been documented in [other work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23821651). The _main_ effect of `--mimicBT2` is to discard orphan alignments for the purposes of quantification. This is a more strict requirement than the default behavior of allowing orphans if there is no satisfactory alignment of both ends of a fragment. However, there is no obvious reason why it is better behavior than accounting for these orphan fragments (when appropriately adjusting the conditional probability given their distance from the transcript boundaries, as salmon does).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/442#issuecomment-549195390:2739,perform,perform,2739,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/442#issuecomment-549195390,2,['perform'],['perform']

Performance," first column will be the per CB level mapping rate i.e. `#mapped reads/#raw reads`. If you wan't absolute values for per-CB reads and mapped reads, it should be in the file `filtered_cb_frequency.txt` and `mappedUMI.txt` respectively.; * `re: cellranger subsampling:` Correct me if I am wrong, when you say cellranger subsampling, do you mean the `cellranger aggregate` pipeline? It's possible you are talking about some other step which I am not aware of but if it's `aggregate` then I think it happens downstream of all the quantification. Indeed coverage bias correction is an important part of the aggregation step but in general it's not the only one and that's why we recommend using the `Seurat` package downstream of the Alevin quantified matrices. We will be more than happy to write a tutorial on, ""how to perform batch correction downstream of Alevin"" but in summary the following steps would be the gist of the process.; - Use Alevin w/o any modification to the `fastq` on both of your sample to generate the gene count matrices. (We have made a major upgrade to the Alevin. We'd recommend using [v0.12.0-alpha](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/v0.12.0-alpha) for now, we are planning to make an official release before the end of this week, currently you can use pre-release. Unfortunately, not available on conda yet).; - Import Alevin count matrices into R using [this](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2018/alevin-seurat/) tutorial .; - Use [this](https://satijalab.org/seurat/immune_alignment.html) to perform the batch correction. ; We do realize it's currently complicated to use things downstream of Alevin and are working constantly on improving the overall pipeline to make the analyses as smooth as possible. If you happen to write a tutorial of your own on doing the analyses, we'd be happy to include that in Alevin tutorial page. However, if you get stuck with any of the above steps do let us know, we'd be more than happy to help in that front too.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/305#issuecomment-433169468:2673,perform,perform,2673,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/305#issuecomment-433169468,2,['perform'],['perform']

Performance," see that the most striking difference is `MSAD_157177.t1` in Run B. The number of estimated reads isn't quite as high as with eXpress, but a considerable number of reads map to `MSAD_157177.t1` (and the posterior variance is still rather large). Given that the behavior you observe using default settings in Salmon is similar to what you observe in RSEM, my guess is that the allocation for `MSAD_157177.t1` in Run B from both of these methods is a result of the strong tendency of the EM algorithm toward sparsity. Though eXpress uses a variant of the EM algorithm, it's actually an *online* EM algorithm, and makes use of a small prior, both of which regularize the estimates it produces. In an offline algorithm (or the offline phase of a dual-algorithm method like Salmon), the same thing can be achieved by using a ""more Bayesian"" inference algorithm than the EM (in this case, using the VBEM algorithm). Most of the time, there is very strong agreement between the estimates produced by different optimization algorithms, but sometimes, as in this case, they can differ considerably. It's still an open area of research and analysis to determine if one such method is ""better"" than another. However, if you have strong external information telling you that `MSAD_157177.t1` should actually be expressed at a non-trivial level in Run B, it looks like the VBEM is giving you a better estimate here. Coming back to the suggestion in your original post, there is no good way, in the optimization procedure to ""switch off the re-assignment between similar genes"", since that is the entire point of the algorithm, and heuristically disabling certain reassignments would destroy any statistical guarantees of the procedure. However, regularizing the estimates is an alternative way of balancing the likelihood based assignment of the EM algorithm with some prior belief (and the strength of this prior belief can be tweaked, in Salmon, by modifying the `--vbPrior` argument when the `--useVBOpt` flag",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/107#issuecomment-263793798:3456,optimiz,optimization,3456,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/107#issuecomment-263793798,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Performance," time to validate Salmon's functionality. Indeed, Salmon is not the problem here. After taking a closer look at my transcript fasta, I noticed a problem with it, as you suggested. Long story short, half the premature transcripts had the wrong orientation and complementarity. Long story:. Oddly, the mature sequences were fine even though I used an identical approach to subset premature and mature transcripts from the genome reference!. Briefly my approach relied on three R packages rtracklayer, GenomicRanges, and Biostrings. 1. I used rtracklayer to load a gtf formatted exon annotations acquired from Ensembl. The file is loaded as a GenomicRanges object which essentially describes the locus of each exon (the transcribed strand [+ or -], chromosome, start and end positions relative to the reference strand) and its associated gene and transcript. 2. I used the GRanges object to generate pre-RNA coordinates that span all exons of a transcript. 3. I loaded the reference genome fasta acquired from Ensembl using the Biostrings package. GRanges and Biostrings are tightly integrated, allowing me to subset sequences from a Biostrings object using the GRanges object. **I believe the problem lies here.** It appears that when subsetting the mature exonic sequences from Biostrings using GRanges, the strand field in the GRanges object **was not** utilized. I.e., I needed to get the reverse complement of the extracted sequences for transcripts on the minus strand. I had done that and assumed that this behaviour would be consistent. However, for reasons I have not been able to pinpoint (potentially a bug), the strand information **was accounted for** when I used GRanges to subset the premature sequences. I **did not** need to get the reverse complement of the premature sequences on the minus strand as I had to do for the mature sequences. Yet, I did that anyway. I initially did test my protocol to ensure it produced identical transcript sequences to Gencode, but I only did this for ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/655#issuecomment-826035191:1393,load,loaded,1393,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/655#issuecomment-826035191,2,['load'],['loaded']

Performance,"#### Introduction. Inspired by the article of Schaeffer et al. (2016), I attempted to use salmon to quantify the proportion of bacterial reads in a paired-end DNA sequencing experiment. I use ""mash screen"" to select a set of reference genomes for the creation of an index for Salmon. #### Question. In order to maximize the performance, I would like to minimize the number of reference genomes for the index, but I would also like to maximize the total number of mapped reads. For other mappers (e.g. bowtie2, bwa-mem), increasing the number of reference genomes will also increase the number of total mapped reads. This does not seem to be the case for Salmon (and also Kallisto). Is there a specific reason why Salmon (and perhaps kallisto) does not guarantee the increase of total mapped reads when one add more reference genomes?. #### Mapping stats. I mapped a paired-end fastq to an index with increasingly more reference genomes.

I've got 24 samples in total (4 rice genotypes, 2-time point for bacterial blight infection, and 3 replications). However, this from the raw sequencing data and even the trimmed reads that I used, I've got similar mapping rates across all samples. Similar length, TPM, and NumReads across all genes for all genes. Though the value for each gene differs in the abovementioned parameters. The EffectiveLength though is 250 for all genes across all samples. I've used all four different versions of Salmon as listed below but I'm still getting the same similar mapping rate and the parameters at quant.sf though the values differ a bit from each Salmon version. **To Reproduce**; ### Steps and data to reproduce the behavior: for version 0.8. **First I took the genome fasta file and the gff3 file and made a transcriptome fasta file using Salmon:**; module load Cufflinks/2.2.1; gffread all.gff3 -g all.chrs.fasta -w MSU7_transcript.fasta. **I then indexed the transcript fasta file.**; #!/bin/bash; #SBATCH -N 1; #SBATCH -c 8; #SBATCH --mem=50G; #SBATCH --mail-use=tarun2@illinois.edu; #SBATCH -J index_Salmon. module load Salmon/0.8.2-IGB-gcc-4.9.4-Python-2.7.13. salmon index -t ~/data/genome/MSU7_transcript.fasta -i ~/data/genome/MSU7_transcript.index --type quasi -k 31. **I then run transcript abundance estimate pipeline for the raw-reads and the trimmed reads as follows:**; #!/bin/bash; #SBATCH -N 1; #SBATCH -c 8; #SBATCH --mem=10G; #SBATCH --mail-use=tarun2@illinois.edu; #SBATCH -J Salmon; #SBATCH -a 1-24. module load Salmon/0.8.2-IGB-gcc-4.9.4-Python-2.7.13. line=$(sed -n -e ""$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID p"" ~/source/BLBnew.txt). salmon quant -i ~/data/genome/MSU7_transcript.index -l A \; -1 ~/data/raw-data/BLB/${line}1.fastq.gz \; -2 ~/data/raw-data/BLB/${line}2.fastq.gz --numBootstraps=30 \; -p ",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/346:1130,load,load,1130,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/346,1,['load'],['load']

Performance,"+1. Trying to quantify ~2000 Smart-Seq2 samples. Currently takes about 5 days on a single node doing 1 cell at a time. Perhaps an easier way to implement this would be to provide a batch mode such that you load the index once and then serially quantify a batch of N samples within the same process. This would save the significant overhead of having to load the index for each sample (~50-75% of the total per-sample processing time). As a bonus, the batch mode could spit out a single transcript x sample matrix so you wouldn't have to run `quantmerge` separately.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/335#issuecomment-1416422342:206,load,load,206,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/335#issuecomment-1416422342,2,['load'],['load']

So as you said I'd say its having issued finding the zlibs library. Similar to how I used 'DZLIB_LIBRARY=/users/work/jake/bin/zlib-1.2.11/zlib.h' to specify the zlib library for 'cmake', is there a way to do it for the 'make' command? I've tried using the following but haven't had success:; make -I /users/work/jake/bin/zlib-1.2.11/zlib.h; make --include-dir=/users/work/jake/bin/zlib-1.2.11/zlib.h.

Performance,"0/20741299/60f84c1a-b697-11e6-9f83-1554ff471e94.png). So, as you can see, there is a substantial amount of uncertainty in RunA, especially for `MSAD_200218.t1`. This can explain how you see this transcript obtaining different numbers of reads over different executions for Run A. Specifically, the inferential uncertainty for this transcript is high, and though the mean of the posterior is close to the value you report above, the range is quite large (200 - 1200) reads (potentially even larger with more bootstraps, but 100 gives us a reasonable window on posterior variance). On the other hand, the EM algorithm *really* wants to assign ~0.8 reads to `MSAD_157177.t1` in Run B. To test how much this might be the result of the tendency of the EM algorithm toward sparsity, I tried processing both samples with Salmon's `--useVBOpt` flag --- causing it to use the variational bayesian optimization algorithm, which yields considerably more *regularized* estimates. The posterior distributions obtained using the VB optimizer are:. ### Run A (VB Opt). ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/361470/20741629/916b3446-b699-11e6-9f92-b8b6d3519981.png). ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/361470/20741636/98510f06-b699-11e6-8d9f-34f1c353c3e6.png). ### Run B (VB Opt). ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/361470/20741642/a1341686-b699-11e6-9a87-8a30f87cd49c.png). ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/361470/20741645/a7340d5c-b699-11e6-90dd-55f9795bac8f.png). So, while there are some small differences for Run A and transcript `MSAD_200218.t1` in Run B, you can see that the most striking difference is `MSAD_157177.t1` in Run B. The number of estimated reads isn't quite as high as with eXpress, but a considerable number of reads map to `MSAD_157177.t1` (and the posterior variance is still rather large). Given that the behavior you observe using default settings in Salmon is similar to what you observe in RSEM, my guess is that the all",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/107#issuecomment-263793798:1850,optimiz,optimizer,1850,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/107#issuecomment-263793798,1,['optimiz'],['optimizer']

Performance,"1/3 loss in performance seems significant, given that presumably the code does something else than just parsing UMIs. I am looking at Boost own comparison and benchmarks, and on long inputs (20MB) it is competitive with PCRE2.

It seems that the [`LibraryFormat` class](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/blob/a6a4fe0dcf71674a59eb901d5ec6933df40de7f2/src/LibraryFormat.cpp#L52) is performing this check, and that the string format method is producing all of this output on stderr. . I believe that the Salmon index I'm using contains some transcript sequences from the ""wrong"" strand, and it would be helpful if the program gave information about the observed mapping (maybe just the transcript sequence ID) so that I could track down the error during index generation. . It also seems that all of the above error output contains no line terminators, although maybe this has been fixed in a more recent version. ```; -bash-4.1$ salmon --version; version : 0.4.0; ```. cc @jmerkin",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/16:2078,perform,performing,2078,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/16,1,['perform'],['performing']

Performance,"> Yes that's one aspect. But also, Salmon uses CIGAR to evaluate alignment probability in alignment quantification mode no?. Indeed. > And with just RapMap output you would lose other information that Salmon uses to determine likely fragment assignment?. You would lose information (in the format of a CIGAR string) that Salmon uses in alignment mode, but not any information, I think, that Salmon uses in quasi-mapping-based mode (though one would incur a non-trivial performance hit for filtering the quasi-mappings through file / disk rather than dealing with them directly in memory as Salmon normally does). > With UMI's you can deduplicate fragments before inferring where they were likely to come from. Ideally you would deduplicate the reads directly based on UMI, then you wouldn't have to think about PCR duplication in the quantification. But of course keeping a hash of all reads in a FASTQ and accounting for dequencing errors wouldn't be really tractable.. I guess this is the real question I have. Specifically, what is the true computational burden to detect and eliminate duplicates using UMIs? In theory, the reads must (1) map to the same location and (2) have the same UMI tag. How often would one expect the UMI tag to be modified / corrupted / etc.? Would you have to search all 1 or 2 hamming distance neighbors to detect duplicates reliably? Is an equivalence class a sufficient proxy for ""mapping to the same location"", or do we also care that e.g. the position of the fragment within each transcript is a duplicate as well? These are the main questions that are preventing me from implementing the ""obvious solution"".",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/108#issuecomment-269001682:469,perform,performance,469,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/108#issuecomment-269001682,1,['perform'],['performance']
Performance,"> You mean like cloud services to perform the DE analysis? It’s always possible to round the non-integer counts to the nearest integer. However, reliable abundance estimation tools (e.g. RSEM) have been around long enough now that it’s worth pushing any cloud service you might be using to properly deal with these types of inputs. We do differential analysis quite commonly with DESeq2, and salmon -> tximport -> DESeq2 is a quite low-friction solution. I noticed that now salmon can export the quant.gene.sf file if I add the parameters""-g xx.gtf"". What's difference between this file and the result of tximport?

Performance,"@SFonsecaCosta,. Yes, the file is called `duplicate_clusters.tsv` and it is in the directory where the salmon *index* resides. The reason this is created is that when transcripts are sequence identical to each other, they cannot be independently quantified — that is, they are inferentially indistinguishable. So, the default strategy is to keep one representative from each indistinguishable cluster and to record the rest in the `duplicate_clusters` file. If you want to force salmon to quantify the duplicates (they should all just get equal abundance of 1 / D where D is the number of duplicates), you can pass `--keepDuplicates` when building the salmon index. When you quantify with alignments performed by STAR, no such duplicate removal is done by STAR upstream, and so all of the sequence identical transcripts are retained.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/803#issuecomment-1263826925:700,perform,performed,700,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/803#issuecomment-1263826925,1,['perform'],['performed']
Performance,"@ctb — One thing that would be required for this (apart from some engineering of the command-line parsing / validation code) is a trustworthy, efficient, _multithreaded_ `FAST(A/Q)` parser for interleaved format reads. Right now, Salmon (& Sailfish, &RapMap, & most of the other HTS-centric methods we're developing) use the Jellyfish 2 read parser. I've made this choice since it's fairly simple to use, yet provides nice parallel performance and, most importantly, is fairly well-tested and trust-worthy.

Performance,"@macmanes — Heng's code is very well-tested, but afaik, completely serialized. Of course, that's nothing that we couldn't handle internally by throwing the reported reads into our concurrent queue. Actually, I think that the Jellyfish 2 parser (for a single `FAST(A/Q)` file) would be easy to make work in this context. The trick is to require that the read ""batches"" always end on an even-indexed boundary, so that we never have an (interleaved) read pair spit across batch boundaries. I'm not sure how easy or difficult that is to enforce. I might just ask Guillaume about the best way to enforce this.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/29#issuecomment-152828484:180,concurren,concurrent,180,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/29#issuecomment-152828484,2,"['concurren', 'queue']","['concurrent', 'queue']"
Performance,"@rob-p - How much effort would it be to run a DP with tracing of the alignment? I remember reading that Brian Bushnell managed to fit everything into the CPU cache for BBMap's alignment algorithm, at least for regular read lengths, so the performance impact should be acceptable if done right. Not sure about licenses, but I think there was an optional native C implementation for it in his code base. This would be great to have so the SAM can be used for e.g. basic genotyping for QC purposes. Alternatively, maybe add a line to the docs of --writeMappings to make sure everyone understands the read alignments will have a score and position, but lack actual alignment and appear as if they were perfect matches.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/491#issuecomment-1204244129:158,cache,cache,158,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/491#issuecomment-1204244129,2,"['cache', 'perform']","['cache', 'performance']"

Performance,"@vals, it shouldn't be a coverage issue, at least as compared to previous versions of Salmon. Hopefully we'll have a chance to look at this soon and see if we can figure out what might be causing the performance ""regression"" when `--useVBOpt` is enabled. As @dcjones suggests, we haven't really seen any performance degradation with the VB option in our other testing, so I suspect something characteristic of this dataset. @dcjones; it's great to see you drop by! I'm actually looking for a reasonable collection of datasets to do (automated) regression testing on new releases of salmon --- something to replace my fairly simple and manual existing regression tests. I'd greatly appreciate any suggestions or advice you may have about this!

Performance,"A bit delayed, but this relates to the questions I've been asking on the salmon gitter. . First, it's worth pointing out that the new 10x (v2) sequencing is a lot more like other bead methods, where (i) index reads (i7/i5) are for labelling biological samples (ii) read1 contains the combined cell and molecular/UMI barcodes (ii) read2 is the transcript 3' read. So it seems there is now some data format convergence. Either way, I'd guess that ongoing iterations of the high throughput platforms will keep one read for the transcript 3', reserving the other 2 or 3 reads for some combination of the sample, cell and molecular barcodes. . Before thinking about how to best collapse UMIs, there's also the issue of how best to QC the barcodes and beads. Jim Namesh has [some functions](http://mccarrolllab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Drop-seqAlignmentCookbookv1.2Jan2016.pdf); as does [Vasilis Ntranos](https://github.com/pachterlab/scRNA-Seq-TCC-prep/blob/master/README.md). Arguably this has nothing to do with salmon/kallisto though I think the kallisto guys were smart to include it. It's a good filter even if only for speeding things up. Then it's really what might be the most appropriate demultiplexing of fastqs to allow compatibility between tecnhiques, I guess. I quite like how the kallisto workflow ends up with a fastq per cell together with a matching UMI file. Then at the very least one can ignore the UMIs (perhaps going with what @vals suggests). Not sure if that's helpful. But thought to chime in as somebody we would love to see salmon working on the high throughput single-cell platforms that have sample, cell and molecular barcodes. Even if only to test how worthwhile UMIs genuinely are for most applications. This may be a controversial comment, but I suspect for me UMIs will largely end up the same way as spike-ins: useful for quantifying endogenous RNA recovered per cell but perhaps not all that useful beyond that for low read depth single-cell signature profiling.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/93#issuecomment-265619589:1606,throughput,throughput,1606,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/93#issuecomment-265619589,1,['throughput'],['throughput']

Performance,"Add [inDropv2 protocol](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.154) to salmon alevin. To use this protocol pass the `--indropV2` flag. The details of library preparation can be seen [here](https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/methods_html/inDrop.html). R1 is the biological read and R2 is the metadata read. Briefly, the reads have 8-11 bp barcode1, followed by a `W1` sequence which should be specified using `--w1` flag then 8bp barcode2 and 6 bp UMI sequence follows. . Summary of changes:; 1. `--indropV2` flag added to process indropV2 reads; 2. a local copy of single cell protocol is created before barcodes and UMI are extracted to allow share the positions and avoid searching twice; 3. In case the barcode1 is less than 11bp, `A` is added after joining barcodes 1 and 2 to make the total length 19 bp; 4. If no exact match for w1 is found, a search for w1 with a hamming distance <=2 is performed. It was tested for correlation on run SRR7165069 from GEO submission [GSM3141960](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM3141960).; Results:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12998572/133622734-9b473318-fb39-421d-a322-b018f93ac139.png). ```; Min. 1st Qu.

Performance,"After generating issue #48, I took the recommendation of switching to the standard EM algorithm, but I'm having further problems. However, I don't think the problem was with the Variational EM algorithm, but an issue with how the dataset is behaving. . This is with the same dataset as before (single end, rRNA-depleted, second-strand protocol, extreme depth of 170M+ reads). I have the options --useFSPD and --biasCorrect turned on with library type ""SF""; the full call is . ```; salmon quant -i $SALMON_DIR -l SF -r <(gzip -c -d $IN_FILE) -o $OUTPUT \; --numBootstraps 100 --useFSPD --geneMap $GENES \; --biasCorrect -p 59; ```. I had attempted to use wasabi and run sleuth, but I got an error where the number of transcripts passing the initial filter was ""NA"". I then discovered that for four samples, many of the transcripts had ""-nan"" generated for the ""NumReads"" column, and this led to all of them having ""-nan"" for the TPM column. One sample had ~100 that failed, but the other three had a variable 106K-109K out of 176K total transcripts fail. No warning or error was thrown during the quantifying or EM optimization steps, so I don't know what happened. Interesting, I should note that the NaNs are only generated when both biasCorrect and useFSPD are turned on. NaNs are not generated when I use only one or neither option. (this was only tested with one sample though). If you have immediate suggestions, that would be great. Otherwise, I can work on generating a test dataset.",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/50:1114,optimiz,optimization,1114,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/50,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Performance,"Damn. There are random numbers, but even setting the seed, the multi-threaded nature of almost all steps leads to non-deterministic behavior. The behavior you describe sounds like some sort of race condition that gets triggered depending on when threads get to different parts of the code. I couldn't get the hanging with the other dataset over multiple (~10) runs. So even if it's completely non-deterministic you seem to be getting it with higher frequency in your system.

Performance,"Dear @callumparr,. Thank you for bringing this up. So you are correct that the `--noLengthCorrection` flag should be passed to salmon when quantifying data that does not have a ""fragmentation effect"", that is, where the number of fragments we expect to draw from a transcript is not dependent upon the length of that transcript. In the ONT protocols, it is usually the case that we get 1 read -> 1 transcript, even if we don't read the whole thing. We have tested the effect of this in ONT data with spike ins, and have verified that using `--noLengthCorrection` does generally lead to improved accuracy with respect to quantification estimates. We have informed ONT of this, and I would guess they may optimize the flags that are used soon (we have also developed an error model that works correctly for these long reads, and that should make it into the next release of salmon). Regarding the effect this has on the `NumReads` values reported by salmon, it's not as simple as with the `TPM` estimates. The length affects the assigned reads through the probabilistic model on which inference is done. With the length effect we have that P(f | t_i) ∝ P( position | f, t_i ) * P( alignment | f, t_i) --- forgetting the alignment term for the time being, we have that with length correction P( position | f, t_i ) ∝ 1 / l_i and without length correction the l_i term goes away. In other words, the probability of allocating reads has a term that depends on the effective length when the `--noLengthCorrection` flag is not passed, but that term goes away when it is passed. This is not quite as drastic as with TPM where the normalization includes the length directly in the normalization (note, however, that when the `--noLengthCorrection` flag is passed, this adjusts the TPM as well). Further, the `NumReads` is still better than TPM in this regard because it still encodes the effect size (i.e. `NumReads` will sum to the total number of aligned reads). Anyway TLDR: Passing the `--noLengthCorrectio",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/651#issuecomment-821995147:703,optimiz,optimize,703,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/651#issuecomment-821995147,2,['optimiz'],['optimize']
Performance,"Dear COMBINE-lab team,. I am using **Alevin** pipeline from the **salmon-1.4.0 release** to preprocess some Drop-Seq data. . From what I understood, Alevin is using sets of low quality, ambiguous and high quality barcodes for the final whitelisting. Ambiguous and high quality ones are sets of barcodes of equal sizes above the knee/threshold used for the initial whitelisting. Ambiguous barcodes get classified as either high or low quality. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this means that the final whitelisted barcodes (those of high quality) should all be above the knee/threshold.; However I observed that **some of the barcodes dumped in the whitelist.txt file from the intelligent whitelisting were not above the knee/threshold used for initial whitelisting.** .

Upon comparing the quant.sf output from salmon 0.8.1 to 1.3.0 (see command below), we noticed that we had far less transcripts with a TPM of unequal 0 in the quant.sf file generated by salmon 1.3.0 compared to the quant.sf output from salmon 0.8.1. . cmd1 = (""{salmon} --no-version-check quant --libType {libType} ""; "" --targets {salmon_ref} --useVBOpt --numBootstraps 50 ""; "" --seqBias --gcBias --geneMap {salmon_gtf}""; "" --sampleOut --sampleUnaligned --threads {threads}""; "" --alignments {input_files[1]} --output {output_dir}/salmon"").

For this particular downsampled bam file, salmon 0.8.1 got 36.9% of TPM’s unequal 0 but for all three differently configured salmon 1.3.0 runs that number drops to 7.3%. .

Performance,"Dear `salmon` developers,. We are using salmon at ONT for quantifying transcripts from alignments of cDNA reads to transcriptomes on a regular basis and in [some](https://github.com/nanoporetech/pipeline-transcriptome-de) of our pipelines.; Transcriptomic aligments of long reads generate less multimapping reads than short reads (depeneding on the structure of the transcriptome), however we would prefer not to ignore them during quantification in order to make maximal use of the data.; However, since the error model was built for short reads, until now we have used the tool with the error model turned off (`--noErrorModel`), which is not optimal. Would it be possible to add a simple error model suitable for long read alignments? We propose something like the following for calculating the likelihood of an alignment:. - The likelihood of the aligment would be calculated based on the empirical distributions (or a normal fit) of edit distances conditioned on the length of the alignment. We could provide you with this information if needed.; - The likelihood of left and right soft or hard clipped sequences would be calculated as a function of their length (such as (1/x)^z, where the parameter z can be tuned based on real datasets). A more complicated model could be build taking into account the error profile of the long reads. It might be overkill though. I had a look at the source code and it seems to me that it might not be hard to implement it, however I am lacking the intimate knowledge of the codebase to do it easily.; Let me know if you would be interested in adding this feature. If yes, we could evaluate the change in the quality of estimates on real datasets.

On x86 this time is small enough to be lost in the noise. `salmon quant -i athal_index -l A ; -1 DRR016125/DRR016125_1.fastq.gz; -2 DRR016125/DRR016125_2.fastq.gz ; -p $threads --validateMappings -o quants/DRR016125_quant`. There is a simple fix which is to ensure the CMake/Makefiles ensure salmon compiles with: ; `-DBOOST_MATH_NO_LONG_DOUBLE_MATH_FUNCTIONS`; or to add that to any file that brings in boost::math via adding `#define BOOST_MATH_NO_LONG_DOUBLE_MATH_FUNCTIONS` at the start. With that change, a 1300 second runtime drops to 1212 for the larger test case, and for the tutorial case is 48 seconds down to 40 on a 4-core r8g.xlarge (Graviton4). Whilst Boost may fix the issue soon - it's likely that older versions of the library will be found installed for some time. It would be helpful to add this define to cmake settings, or the sources.",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/966:129,perform,performance,129,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/966,2,['perform'],['performance']

Performance,"FYI, miniconda works fine on FreeBSD. It's not too difficult to configure manually, but to make it even easier:. As root:. ```; pkg install auto-admin linux-miniconda-installer; auto-install-linux_base; ```; As a non-root user:. ```; miniconda-installer; conda-shell; conda config --add channels conda-forge; conda config --add channels bioconda; conda create -n salmon salmon; ```; Note: Just running `conda install salmon` instead of `conda create -n salmon salmon` will install a very old version rather than the latest. This utilizes the Linux compatibility module, which simply adds Linux system calls to the FreeBSD kernel. Unlike a virtual machine, there's no performance penalty and memory overhead is trivial. In fact, Linux binaries sometimes run slightly faster on FreeBSD than they do on Linux. Average speed is about the same. I'd only use conda as a stop-gap, though. There's a large and growing selection of bioinformatics software in FreeBSD ports that can be more easily installed and used, e.g. 'pkg install samtools bwa'.

Performance,"Good morning,. I'm a *nix developer with a lot of experience porting software to various platforms. My preferred method for deployment is build-from-source package managers such as FreeBSD ports, Gentoo Portage, MacPorts, pkgsrc (which I use extensively on CentOS), etc. Package managers in-general minimize problems for end users (and hence reduce PRs for you guys). Build-from-source package managers also allow customizing build options (e.g. adding -march=native), which can sometimes offer significantly better performance than you can get from a generic binary package that has to support older CPUs. Currently, developing such packages for salmon is a challenge due to the way the build system works. I've been looking through the build system and the main barrier to packaging is the unconditional bundling of some dependencies, such as seqlib and htslib. If you were to update the cmake systems so that they first look for *all* dependencies installed externally, as they already do for jemalloc and tbb, then it would be easier for developers to package salmon.

Performance,"Hello, I hope you're well!. ### Context. 1. I performed short-read (Illumina, 150bp PE) and long-read (ONT, cDNA+PCR) RNA-sequencing on 12 human cell line samples (4 conditions, 3 biological replicates each).; 2. I aligned the short-reads to chm13v2.0_RefSeq_Liftoff_v5.1.gff3 using HISAT2, and the long reads to chm13v2.0.fa using Minimap2.; 4. I used StringTie hybrid assembly mode (--mix option) to generate GTFs using both technologies (to take advantage of structural information from long reads and accuracy from short reads).; 5. I then ran stringtie --merge to generate the transcriptome assembly GTF from the sample GTFs.; 6. I took this merged transcriptome and further annotated it using SQANTI3 (with chm13v2.0_RefSeq_Liftoff_v5.1.gtf and chm13v2.0.fa).; 7. I converted both the SQANTI-annotated and the StringTie GTFs into fasta as follows:; `gffread -w merged_transcriptome.fa -g chm13v2.0.fa merged_transcripts.gtf`. Now I'm trying to quantify with Salmon. Firstly, I'm not sure whether it's better to use the short or long reads here as input to Salmon, given that my goal is to identify short peptides (I have peptidomics data) derived from specific splicing events. You may or may not be able to help me with that, but if you have thoughts, I'd appreciate them! Anyway, I decided arbitrarily to use the long-read BAMs as input to Salmon. ### Bug description; Secondly, as discussed a little in #104 , I keep running into:; `Transcript NM_032515.5 appears in the reference but did not appear in the BAM`; and; `Transcript chr19 appeared in the BAM header, but was not in the provided FASTA file`; (note here that it's an entire chromosome??? And these are the only ""transcripts"" that don't appear in the fasta- they're all just the chromosome names.); This happened regardless of whether I used the Stringtie fasta or the SQNATI-annotated fasta. This is the salmon command I had run:; `$salmon quant --ont -t $transcriptome -l SF -a $bam -o $outdir/$name`.

Performance,"Hello,. I am using the recent downloaded executable for v1.1.0 and am using salmon (bulk-mode). Noticed one potential bug and have some general questions regarding bootstraps. 1. The potential bug I noticed was when I use `--numGibbsSamples` the logs/salmon_quant.log file is always blank. When I remove this flag and re-run the program the log file is correctly printed out. 2. Regarding Bootstraps:. I've been working with parameters to min/max my predicted estimates to quantified cDNA results that we have. Through this process I was not performing bootstraps and was just using the TPM results that were located within the `quants.sf` file and have been getting some good results, with R-squared values of ~0.98 for actual v. predicted plots. As a note, even after running hundreds of runs with the same parameters, the TPM values in the `quants.sf` file never really fluctuated that much between runs and were generally nearly identical. . However, I thought it would be best to bootstrap `--numBootstraps` each Salmon run and average the bootstraps to get more accurate results. After doing 1,000 bootstraps per sample I noticed that the TPM values I calculated from numbers of mapped reads in the `bootstraps.gz` fluctuated a lot more and overall brought my R-squared values down to ~0.87. (I used your ConvertBootstrapsToTSV.py script to get the read counts from the bootstrap file and then calculated the TPMs using the effective lengths from the `quants.sf` file. As looking through previous issues (#246) I was under the assumption that the bootstrap file only contained new mapped read estimates and the effective lengths should be the same for all bootstrap runs.) . My question is why do the TPM values in the `quants.sf` file not fluctuate as much (even after 100+ runs using the same parameters), while calculated TPM values from bootstraps of the same run are showing greater variance?",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/466:542,perform,performing,542,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/466,1,['perform'],['performing']

Performance,"Hello,. We are using Salmon to quantify gene counts for samples in RNA-Seq experiment. We will be using the weights of the equivalence class to perform a calculation for which we require the effective length of the equivalence classes. I checked in the eq_class.txt file under the aux_info directory but I was unable to find it. We are using alignment-based method where we supply a bamfile to salmon. Could you please help us to obtain the effective length of the equivalence classes?. I have another question. Salmon operates in both lightweight alignment mode and in alignment mode. For the lightweight mode, one needs to first create an index (which is the colored De Bruijn graph). I understand that this index (along with all the equivalence class) remains the same even when gene counts of different RNA-Seq samples are estimated. But I am a bit confused about the alignment-based method. In this case, salmon does not require an index since it has the actual alignments. If we have multiple samples, which are mapped to the same transcriptome will Salmon return the same set of equivalence classes? Since the samples are different the weights will change and so will the reads mapped to each equivalence class but will the set of eq. classes change?.

Performance,"Hi @AndrewSkelton,. There is currently no easy way to keep the index in RAM as STAR/Bowtie2 do. This is a feature we've been interested in for a _long_ time, but it's a feature that is very hard to justify spending a PhD student's time on since it's not going to contribute directly to any paper. But, this is a feature we'd like to add and maybe we can swing it with some of the CZI round-3 funding we just got. Nonetheless, the capability currently doesn't exist. Salmon can take multiple fastq files as input, but then it assumes they all derive from the same library, so you get one ""aggregate"" quant.sf, which isn't what you want here. So, I think the only approach currently would be to schedule a number of small jobs. I get why this isn't ideal. One small saving grace is that recent versions of salmon (>= 1.0.0) adopt the pufferfish index which is _much_ smaller than the previous RapMap index. Thus, the index loading time is quite small for a typical transcriptome. Also, this often allows operating system cache to keep the index around, even if it's not explicitly stored in shared memory.

Performance,"Hi @AngryMaciek,. You can get either Gibbs samples from the posterior, or bootstrap estimates. To get the former, you pass `--numGibbsSamples <nsamp>` to salmon, and to get the latter, you pass `--numBootstraps <nsamp>`. Either way, samples will be written to a binary, gzipped file in `aux_dir/bootstrap/ bootstraps.gz` (we decided to keep a uniform file name regardless of the sampling type, however the type of sampling performed can be derived from `aux_dir/meta_info.json`). Two things to point out here. First, the binary file format can be converted to TSV if you prefer using [this script](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/blob/master/scripts/ConvertBootstrapsToTSV.py). Second, these are samples over the number of reads assigned to the transcripts (not the TPMs directly). However, you could easily convert samples over the number of reads to samples over the TPMs by applying the TPM formula (i.e. TPM_i = 10^6 * (num_reads_i / effective_length_i) / (sum_j (num_reads_j / effective_length_j))).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/246#issuecomment-401834462:423,perform,performed,423,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/246#issuecomment-401834462,1,['perform'],['performed']
Performance,"Hi @BenLangmead!. Thanks for the formal feature request. This is, indeed, a great idea, and something I've been interested in for quite a while. As far as I can tell, the main impediment to this is the hash table (https://github.com/greg7mdp/sparsepp) used in the index. The suffix array used by the mapping algorithm (by virtue of simply being a flat array of either 32 or 64-bit integers) is trivial to load via shared memory, as is the flat representation of the concatenated text itself. The bitvector and rank data structure that separate individual transcript sequences might be a bit trickier, but is also small enough to exist per-process. However, it's unclear to me if there is an easy or straightforward way to have the hash table reside in shared memory, and this is usually the single largest element of the index. As I mentioned, this is a feature that I've thought would be very useful for quite a while, and I'm interested in seeing it implemented.

Performance,"Hi @FlorianRNA ! As stated in the [usage docs](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.8.1/usage#quantification-options) for the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline:. ""Since v3.0 of the pipeline, featureCounts is no longer used to perform gene/transcript quantification, however it is still used to generate QC metrics based on [biotype](http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/biotypes.html) information available within GFF/GTF genome annotation files. This decision was made primarily because of the limitations of featureCounts to appropriately quantify gene expression data. Please see [Zhao et al., 2015](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141910#pone-0141910-t001) and [Soneson et al., 2015](https://f1000research.com/articles/4-1521/v1)."". This is a common cause of confusion and I have tried to be as explicit about this in the docs. featureCounts is used to quantify features in the annotation by `gene_biotype` and not the actual gene / transcript features themselves. This may explain why you are seeing these discrepancies. However, I am still a little puzzled how you are able to directly compare the counts generated by featureCounts and Salmon (in either mode) because the core features that are being quantified should be different. Where did you get the plant reference genome from? If it's not from Ensembl then it probably isn't worth running the biotype quantification with featureCounts anyway because the GTF annotation files may not contain that information. There are some docs for this [here](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.8.1/usage#prokaryotic-genome-annotations).

Performance,"Hi @GWW ,. Ok, we figured out where the threads are coming from. Deep inside the concurrent hash map we are using, there is a [function that grows the hash map](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/blob/master/include/cuckoohash_map.hh#L1558). This function uses a function called [`parallel_exec`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/blob/master/include/cuckoohash_map.hh#L1751) to move the items from the old table to the new one. Here, they greedily use as many threads as available for that process. We can't see this behavior on our end by monitoring top/htop, because the hash table doubling happens so fast it's below the monitoring resolution. There are a couple ways to address this, one of which is hacking inside the hashmap library to modify this behavior. However, it would be nice if there was a way to do this without modifying the code (e.g. by limiting the number of threads the process was allowed to spawn concurrently from outside of the process itself).

The references indexed would be the gnomes (and / or contigs) of the potential organisms in the sample, and the output would be the estimated number of fragments arising from each contig / genome. If a given organism is split across multiple contigs, one would aggregate them post quantification in the same way one aggregates transcript abundance estimates to the gene level (i.e. the natural way to do this would be to create a contig to organism mapping and to load up the quantification results using tximport).

Performance,"Hi @Kisekya,. So BWA-MEM and BWA-MEM2 are somewhat of a problem to begin with because they perform local alignment, which isn't really ideal for aligning RNA-seq reads to the transcriptome. If you really wish to use an aligner, we've had good experiences with Bowtie2 (when used in the appropriate end-to-end alignment mode) and with STAR (using the alignments projected to the transcriptome with `--quantMode TranscriptomeSAM` flag to output the alignments in transcriptomic coordinates as required by salmon). Apart from the local alignment issue, sorting the BAM file is _absolutely_ a problem for salmon, and is likely why you get the strange library type. When run in alignment mode, just like RSEM, salmon requires the alignments for the the mates of a read pair to appear subsequently in the file, and for all alignments for a given read to appear contiguously in the file. This allows parsing the reads without having to require potentially unbounded memory (holding the record for one end of a fragment in memory while waiting for the record for the other end). In fact, given that you've sorted the alignments here, I'm surprised you're not getting the ""suspicious pair"" warnings in your logs. The ISR library with 40% mapping is likely a more reliable number. The obvious question here is why might the mapping rate be this low? There are a few reasons you might see something like this. One, for example, is poor ribosomal depletion, paired with not having all of the rRNA sequences in your index. In this case, you have many fewer reads coming from the rest of the transcriptome and you get depleted mapping rates like this. . Could you say a bit more about the experimental setup? Is this in a well-annotated organism like human / mouse etc.? Is this a polyA selection or ribosomal depletion prep? Anything else that might be relevant to sample quality?.

While it is true, as I mentioned in my original post, that the conditioning on the transcripts is _fundamental_ in the case of salmon and other transcript expression tools that don't, themselves, try to assemble new transcripts, it's not necessarily true that there is no evidence in the quantifications that something my be awry.

Performance,"Hi @Ray6283,. It seems you are asking about the EM/VBEM algorithm in general. I would say your description is _almost_ right, except this part:. > Then using p_ij s , we put f_j to transcripts with highest probability , say t_jm , we do this for all fragments, so for each fragment we have assigned unique transcript. So we can have new eta, call it eta_1 ( because we have abundance). Specifically, the EM algorithm does _not_ do ""hard"" assignment. That is, at no point during the algorithm, is a fragment fully assigned to a specific transcript (unless it was uniquely mapped there). Rather, the EM algorithm performs ""soft"" assignment. So, consider we have a fragment $f_j$ that maps to two transcripts $t_{j1}$ and $t_{j2}$. The EM algorithm will ""partially"" allocate this fragment to each of the transcripts. Specifically, it will allocate them proportional to $P(f_j \in t_{j1}) \propto P(t_{j1} \mid \eta) P(f_j \mid t_{j1})$ and $P(f_j \in t_{j2}) \propto P(t_{j2} \mid \eta) P(f_j \mid t_{j2})$ respectively. Then, in the ""M"" phase of the EM algorithm, one calculates the total mass arising from a transcript $t_i$ as $\sum_{f_j \text{ such that } f_j \text{ maps to } t_i} P(f_j \in t_i)$ (one sum). Computing these abundances for all $t_i$ gives us our next estimate of $\eta$, and then we can go back and re-compute the probabilities $P(f_j \in t_{j1})$ etc. This is done until convergence. _Originally posted by @rob-p in https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/discussions/889#discussioncomment-7304773_",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/890:611,perform,performs,611,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/890,1,['perform'],['performs']

Performance,"Hi @apredeus,. In short, what you explain in the first paragraph is right and is the expected behavior. However, to simplify the parsing algorithm (i.e. to ensure that BAM input can be parsed in bounded memory), both `salmon` and `RSEM` require that all of the alignments for a given read are adjacent within the input BAM file. If this is violated, they will be treated as different reads. In other words, if you have something like:. ```; read1:aln1; read1:aln2; read1:aln3; read2:aln1; read2:aln2; read2:aln3; ```. then in total, 2 ""reads"" worth of mass will be assigned (probabilistically across the targets). However, if you have. ```; read1:aln1; read1:aln2; read2:aln1; read1:aln3; read2:aln2; read2:aln3; ```. Then there will be *4* total reads assigned. Each time the query name (read name modulo 1/2 of a paired-end read) changes in the BAM stream, it is assumed to be a new read, and its alignments are dealt with separately. Both Bowtie2 and STAR (when projecting genomic alignments to the transcriptome) will follow this convention by default, but I'm not certain the same is true for other aligners. Again, this restriction is present in both `RSEM` and `salmon`, and it's an optimization that is made because otherwise there can be unbounded distance in the worst case between the different alignments for a read and so the parser would either have to hold all alignments in memory (which is very bad), or make many passes over the input BAM (which is also very bad) to perform quantification.

Performance,"Hi @cfischer1991,. Thanks for the report. There have certainly been _a lot_ of improvements and changes to salmon between v0.8.1 and v1.3.0. The built-in mapping functionality has been largely overhauled. However, I can see that you're not using that here (you're quantifying from alignments). There have been a number of improvements in the alignment-based codepath as well. However, I'd guess that one of the biggest differences in the results you're seeing is due to a changes in the variational Bayes prior that happened between these versions. Specifically, the prior was adjusted to be smaller, and the default was changed from a `per-nucleotide` prior to a `per-transcript` prior. You can try and achieve the newer functionality in 0.8.1 by setting `--perTranscriptPrior` and `--vbPrior 0.01` and seeing, under those settings, how differently things look between 0.8.1 and 1.3.0. *Also*, another important change is in the handling of _incompatible_ alignments — alignments that do not match the prescribed library type. The incompatibility prior used to be set to a small but non-zero value by default `9.9999999999999995e-21`, but has since been changed to `0` by default. Both of these changes in the default have been results of a lot of internal testing suggesting these settings improve quantification results _in general_ (of course, given the complexity in of the quantification problem, there is likely no universal set of parameters that are optimal with respect to every experiment).

Performance,"Hi @charlesfoster,. Thanks for opening the issue. The second run looks like it ends before there is any information about mapped reads. Have mappings started to be reported at that point? I wonder if there is some issue related to the loading of the index. I have a few suggestions that may be worthwhile to try:. 1) Do you observe the same problem if you index only the transcriptome (i.e. if you don't also include the genome as a decoy)?. 2) If you are using nfcore/rnaseq you can also consider using the STAR => salmon path. Of course, I'm interested in addressing whatever the underlying issue here is anyway, but it's worth noting that this may be a viable alternative to allow you to process all of these samples using the nfcore pipeline in the meantime. This will align the reads to the genome using STAR (which gives the benefit of having a full decoy), project them to the transcriptome, and then quantify them. Also, if you can share a set of problematic reads (or even a subset of them that will reproduce the extreme slowness problem) privately, that would be very helpful in debugging. In addition to trying to debug what's going on here, I'd probably also try running them through [piscem](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/piscem). While this isn't yet an actual substitute for salmon, it will help isolate if the problem is directly related to the index or something else.

Rather, when you see a read mapped to a transcript in the SAM/BAM file, you should interpret this as the read _could_ be assigned (most likely proportionally) to the transcript.

Performance,"Hi @jashapiro,. So there are definitely a few things going on here. The first is that you correctly diagnosed the missing cmd_info.json information when `alevin` is run in RAD mode. That was simply an oversight, and there is no reason that file shouldn't have been written. Second, there is also useful information that belongs in `meta_info.json` in the `aux_info` directory (like the SHA hash of the reference sequences); that was also missing but has now been added.; ; In addition to salmon's `alevin` command, each step of `alevin-fry` also writes some useful metadata when it executes. For example, there is a json file written by the `generate-permit-list` step, one written by the `collate` step, and one written by the `quant` step. We've never run into the problem of the output of `alevin-fry` overwriting the output of `alevin` because we use a directory structure where the output quantifications reside in a separate directory from the input RAD file. However, I can now see that if you're writing the quants in the same place as the input, then there will be a conflict in the file names, and the existing files will be overwritten with the new ones. I agree that both tools output useful information. I'm a *bit* ambivalent about assuming the salmon-generated files exist, and merging them into one output file, as I think there might be cases where those files aren't present and `alevin-fry` should still run properly since it doesn't require them to perform it's processing. One option would be to rename the `alevin-fry` output files to prefix/postfix them so they don't collide with the salmon files even if they live in the same directory. Then, one could (now or later) write a small command to merge the relevant json files into a unified output if that would be more convenient downstream. Let me know your thoughts.

Performance,"Hi @jeremymsimon,. I've discussed the support for SPLiT-seq/ParseBio with @Gaura in some depth. Honestly, I think the cleanest solution right now is just to have a more streamlined (and streaming) way to match / replace the random hexamers upstream of alevin-fry. By my understanding, if we can simply replace barcode 1 appropriately (as your Perl script currently does), everything should work downstream in alevin/alevin-fry.; ; To that end, I've thrown together a small rust program based on your Perl script. Currently that lives [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/splitp). It reads the same basic parameters as the Perl script, and writes its output to stdout so that it can be used with named pipes. For example, something like:; ; ```; <normal salmon command> -1 read_file_1.fq -2 <(splitp --read-file read_file_2.fq --bc-map bcSharing_example.txt --start 79 --end 86 --one-hamming); ```. which will transform the second fastq file and stream the transformed reads out which can then be read by alevin-fry. One important thing to note is that while *alevin* requires the input reads to be a real file (i.e. you can't stream reads in because it does 2 passes), if you are mapping these reads for processing with *alevin-fry* you can use the process substitution trick above. As you hinted, this program works considerably faster than the Perl script. For example, for the first 10,000,000 reads in `SRR6750042`, the Perl script took 2m 48s to transform the reads and `splitp` took ~6s (if the output wasn't being written to a file on disk it took <4s). This should generally be fast enough to not be a speed bottleneck. So, perhaps the next step is to try to help you walk through this approach with a test dataset (and ideally using alevin-fry) to see if things are turning out as expected?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-961598108:1617,bottleneck,bottleneck,1617,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699#issuecomment-961598108,2,['bottleneck'],['bottleneck']
Performance,"Hi @juugii ,; Thanks for the very important and interesting discussion.; You are right, for the calculation of sequence saturation one *might* not need the exact deduplicated UMI count **but** I had to bring that part into the discussion as it was mentioned that you wanted to compare different deduplication strategies. I think your suggestion makes sense and mostly aligns with the definition being used by 10x [here](https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003646912-How-is-sequencing-saturation-calculated-). Although note they have changed the definition with the new version of the software. Anyhow, the *short answer* to the question of how can we generate that in Alevin environment is -- by post processing the dumpFeatures output of the Alevin run. _long answer_: The difference lies in the term deduplication and the strategy used to perform it. Basically the fundamental unit for deduplication in 10x as mentioned in the link above is a tuple of `(valid cell-barcode, valid UMI, gene) `, while that's not exactly true for us. We can certainly generate it but it does not aligns with the theory of Alevin's deduplication Algorithm. Having said that, I also like your idea of using:; > the gene quantifications from (de)duplicated UMIs, gene quantifications from unique UMIs, using them to have an idea of the amount/ratio of redundant information. However, the above definition reflect more of the duplication rate (at least in terms of the definition defined in *Alevin* manuscript [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/01/335000)) than sequence saturation. **NOTE** the quoted definition was actually the 10x definition of sequence saturation too before it was changed, at least in my understanding. If you need the deduplication rate of each cell you can get that by using `--dumpFeature` flag in the Alevin run and look for file `featureDump.txt`.

Performance,"Hi @kvittingseerup,. No need to apologize, I think it was I who was not clear. What I am saying is that this is *already* the way that Salmon handles such a case. That is, if you have a paired-end read, and one of the reads maps but the other doesn't (due to e.g., adapter contamination or just very low quality), then Salmon will consider the remaining (mapping) end of the read as representative of an entire fragment, and will resolve the fragment origin accordingly during optimization. Generally, not having both ends of a paired-end read leads to increased ambiguity, but this isn't a particularly big problem if it only happens to a generally small fraction of the reads. Further, since you cannot reliably infer the implied fragment length on a transcript from only a single-end read, such mappings will not contribute to the bias model. Again, however, as long as this doesn't happen to the vast majority of fragments, it should have only a negligible effect on quantification and bias correction.

We referred to this index as the quasi-index. As the software evolved and we continued to improve the mapping methodology, we eventually transitioned over to an index based on [our pufferfish data structure](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish). In addition to the new data structure, this coincided with our move over to selective-alignment as the mapping algorithm, and all of this happened at the 1.0.0 release (this is why, for example, indices built before 1.0.0 are not compatible with salmon > 1.0.0; a topic on which there have been a few GitHub issues). However, given the fact that the documentation and software are linked only through manual human intervention (we haven't leveled up to e.g. having salmon be a [literate program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) yet), these two sometimes get out of sync. This is an instance of that. We have maintained the functionality of the `--writeMappings` feature, and in fact, even augmented it. However, we have not replaced the antiquated `quasi-index` terminology in the documentation. The TLDR is that you can use `--writeMappings` with the index you built with the `salmon index` command, and it should work fine. If you are mapping against an index without decoy sequences, then the output format will be basically ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/727#issuecomment-996192524:469,perform,performed,469,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/727#issuecomment-996192524,1,['perform'],['performed']
Performance,"Hi @mugpeng,. This is because it is covered by the custom geometry specification (as laid out in the docs). I agree it's nice to have a specific flag for each geometry, rather than to have to e.g. specify the custom geometry each time. We are working on good solutions to that at a higher level (e.g. in our `simpleaf` tool where users can register their own custom geometry specifications and refer to them by name). However, in `salmon`/`alevin` right now, the named geometries are hard-coded, and so to have a specific `--indropV2` flag, that would have to be added to the argument parser and then mapped to the specific underlying geometry in the code. This isn't hard, but as the number of different chemistries proliferates, it's not ultimately a scalable solution. So, the current recommendation would be to use the custom geometry flags as specified in the documentation, or adopt a wrapper like `simpleaf` and add `indropV2` to your custom geometry specification library.

Performance,"Hi @nh13,. This is not something for which we currently have support or something that we currently plan. I'd be open to it, but I'm honestly not sure how to cleanly do it in the current architecture, and doing so would certainly incur a performance hit. Salmon runs 2 phases of inference; and online phase and an offline phase. The online phase has access to _fragment-level_ information that is then summarized away during the offline phase (like the specific locations of each read, the length of each observed fragment, etc.). That information goes away when the reads are summarized into range-factorized equivalence classes. Moreover, some of the model parameters learned during the online phase will depend (in their details) on the order in which observations are made. Ostensibly, observing the same data in the same order **and issuing updates to shared model parameters from worker threads in the same order** should result in identical values, however this has never been tested and was never a design goal. The reason for this is that differences between runs are within the bounds of the inherent inferential uncertainty of the estimated parameters anyway. That is, if one is relying on a specific value at a level of precision such that a different run of salmon would produce a value different enough to change a downstream analysis, then one is imparting more precision on the estimates than they can provide. Other methods that produce identical results between runs for these values may produce the same output, but the accuracy of the output at that level shouldn't be trusted in this case. The uncertainty of the parameter estimates can be evaluated based on the Gibb samples (or bootstrap replicates) that salmon computes. Of course, the small differences between runs rarely lead to differences in downstream analysis (almost certainly at the gene level and also at the transcript level if you use a differential testing method that is aware of inferential uncertainty).

Performance,"Hi @ramezrawas,. Can you say precisely what you mean by reproducible? Do you mean that the values in the .sf file are not identical? If so, this is expected behavior. It exists for a number of reasons. The big one is that the initial phase of salmon uses an online inference algorithm so that specific details of the solution are dependent on the order in which the reads are processed (which is random given that multiple threads parse reads and update estimates asynchronously). However, the more important point here is that the inference estimates returned by Salmon (and, for that matter, every other transcript-level expression tool) are the result of a statistical optimization procedure that cannot guarantee a unique global optimal solution (and, in fact, even if a global optimum could be guaranteed, there may be multiple different optima). Thus, there is uncertainty inherent in the statistical problem being solved. Of course, if one ordered updates in the same way and set up the initial conditions precisely the same, there would be convergence to the same result, but any sense of confidence there is illusory. However, Salmon does provide a way to quantify, statistically, confidence in the result. The `--numBootstraps` option will do bootstrap sampling, or the `--numGibbsSamples` option will perform posterior Gibbs sampling. Both of these techniques will provide samples from the posterior distribution, and the variance of these samples will give you some information about the variance in the results that are due purely to the inherent statistical uncertainty in the problem. In the `scripts` folder there is a python script `ConvertBootstrapsToTSV.py` that will convert either the bootstrap or gibbs samples to a easily readable tsv format. These samples represent the estimated number of reads coming from each transcript when sampling from the posterior. These can be used to empirically estimate that statistical uncertainty in the abundance estimates of the different tran",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/102#issuecomment-259464248:672,optimiz,optimization,672,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/102#issuecomment-259464248,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']
Performance,"Hi @red-plant,. So, I have some update from our end. @mohsenzakeri dug into the data a bit (specifically `SRR7985407`). What he found is that there are a considerable number of reads (~13%) have long stretches of polyA or polyT that are matching in a hyper-repetitive manner internally within a certain set of transcripts (i.e. these are not matching polyA tails, because those are already trimmed). These matches are, obviously, minimally informative, but we had not special-cased ignoring them yet. Specifically, what seems to be prevalent in these reads are read pairs where one read has polyA, the other has polyT, and the keep matching to the same positions. However, the rest of the reads don't match the transcript, so a bunch of time is wasted on validating (and discarding) these mappings. To test this hypothesis, we made a small change to the mapping algorithm to special case and ignore k-mers that are purely homopolymers. I'll note that in this data, this has no effect on the mapping rate. I get the following performance profile running the trimmed version of this data (having trimmed with `fastp`) using 4 threads, and _without_ the additional `--hitFilterPolicy BOTH` flag. ```; 1306.86user 4.79system 4:42.54elapsed 464%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 592704maxresident)k; ```. I was wondering if you might test this altered version out and see if it has a similarly beneficial effect for you as well. Probably, the time will be different, since the processors themselves are, and since I elided all non-essential flags here, but I would hope this version is faster than the current (even with the altered `hitFilterPolicy`).

However, I am not sure what is stranger; that 1.2.1 takes ~5x longer for you, or that 1.0.0 is taking > 5H in the first place! I can confirm that I am getting really strange (i.e. slow) behavior on this sample under both versions. It's unexpected because I've never seen a sample take this long before. We are looking into it, and will report back. However, since digging into the data to figure out precisely what is going on may take a little bit, I wanted to ask if you can try something.

Performance,"Hi @reganhayward,. Thank you for the detailed report. It's interesting that this happens when running with STAR but not when running with selective alignment. However, salmon will attempt to solve the optimization problem with the alignments it is given, regardless of if those come from STAR or from it's built-in selective alignment. While I would generally expect these to be similar, the alignment algorithms are different; see [e.g. the differences between SA/SAF & STAR here](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02151-8). Nonetheless, it is possible that for a small subset of transcripts, the probabilistic allocations are _so_ ambiguous, that you get large swings in the resulting quantification estimates based on tiny variations in where the optimization starts (which is, itself, stochastic due to the asynchronous nature of salmon's online inference phase). One way we can test this hypothesis is as follows. You can run salmon with `--numGibbsSamples 100` and `-d`. This will tell salmon to perform posterior Gibbs sampling (`--numGibbsSamples 100`) and to dump the range-factorized equivalence classes used for offline quantification (`-d`). The Gibbs sampling files will contain the traces for the transcripts in question over the various iterations of the sampling procedure. Transcripts where there is a tremendous amount of ambiguity will tend to have highly anti-correlated posterior samples, and similarly, if you were to consider the abundance output of these transcripts as a *group*, there would be a large reduction in inferential relative variance. In fact, we [wrote a whole paper on this topic](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/Supplement_1/i102/5870485).

Performance,"Hi @rekado,. The order is determined based on how work is pulled from a queue. Specifically, the way quantification works in the first phase is that independent threads pull reads to be processed from a lock-free concurrent queue [e.g. here for paired-end reads](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/blob/master/src/SalmonQuantify.cpp#L981). This queue is filled in by parsing threads (e.g. [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/blob/master/src/FastxParser.cpp#L151)). This is the major source of stochasticity. One other source is that once reads are pulled from the queue, they are mapped and then their contribution to the quantifications is processed in [this function](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/blob/master/src/SalmonQuantify.cpp#L165) which, itself, calls update functions to a few classes that are potentially being updated by many threads.

Performance,"Hi @rhlampe,. Currently, there is no way to prevent the salmon indexer from using more memory if it is needed ot build the index. However, if there is a limit placed by the cluster, it will likely just result in a `bad_alloc` exception from the indexer. The number of sequences alone can tell you a bit about scaling, but the total number of nuclotides being indexed is actually a better predictor of resource usage. How many nucleotides, total, are the references you're considering? While we are working on ways to make the indexing scheme highly scalable, it's worth noting that, to achieve some of it's speed, salmon pre-computes a lot of information it its index (so that the index can become fairly large). One thing I might suggest, if you want to attempt to index and quantify on a very large reference, is to use the `--perfectHash` index in the newest development version of Salmon (pre-release tarball attached below). The latest version (for which the official version should appear soon) represents a number of improvements to index construction. The default indexer has reduced memory usage by ~40%, and the new `--perfectHash` indexer, while somewhat slower, reduces the memory usage even more (by an additional 40-50%). With a fixed memory budget, then, it should allow you to index ever larger references. --Rob.

Performance,"Hi @rmurray2,. Thanks again for the detailed question (I answered them in reverse order, so that's why I'm saying ""again"" here). There are a few things going on that could be leading to differences. They are, in the order I think they will have an effect on the result:. * You are using RSEM in a mode that is mapping the reads to the entire genome (using STAR) and then projecting the resulting alignments to the transcriptome. You are using salmon in a way that is performing selective alignment against the transcriptome only. We have recently published [a paper](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02151-8) discussing in detail the effect that some of these choices can have on transcript and gene-level abundance estimation. In general, if you don't include the genome as a mapping target, depending on your sample, there may be certain reads that are assigned to the transcriptome even though they have a better alignment to some other genomic location. This is independent of e.g. salmon and RSEM, and you'd observe the same thing if you ran RSEM using e.g. Bowtie2 as the aligner aligning against the transcriptome. Luckily, you can control this source of variation. Salmon, like RSEM, can accept alignments to the transcriptome produced by STAR. If you want to see how big of an effect this is having in your sample, you can align reads to the genome using STAR (and project them to the transcriptome) to produce a BAM file that salmon can quantify. You can check RSEM's script to see exactly how it invokes STAR, but the parameters are something like `--outFilterType BySJout --alignSJoverhangMin 8 --outFilterMultimapNmax 20 --alignSJDBoverhangMin 1 --outFilterMismatchNmax 999 --outFilterMismatchNoverReadLmax 0.04 --alignIntronMin 20 --alignIntronMax 1000000 --alignMatesGapMax 1000000 --eadFilesCommand zcat --outSAMtype BAM Unsorted --quantMode TranscriptomeSAM --outSAMattributes NH HI AS NM MD --quantTranscriptomeBan IndelSoftclipSingleend`; note tha",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/612#issuecomment-758004590:467,perform,performing,467,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/612#issuecomment-758004590,2,['perform'],['performing']

Performance,"Hi @rob-p and @davismcc . A bit delayed, but this relates to the questions I've been asking on the salmon gitter. . First, it's worth pointing out that the new 10x (v2) sequencing is a lot more like other bead methods, where (i) index reads (i7/i5) are for labelling biological samples (ii) read1 contains the combined cell and molecular/UMI barcodes (ii) read2 is the transcript 3' read. So it seems there is now some data format convergence. Either way, I'd guess that ongoing iterations of the high throughput platforms will keep one read for the transcript 3', reserving the other 2 or 3 reads for some combination of the sample, cell and molecular barcodes. . Before thinking about how to best collapse UMIs, there's also the issue of how best to QC the barcodes and beads. Jim Namesh has [some functions](http://mccarrolllab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Drop-seqAlignmentCookbookv1.2Jan2016.pdf); as does [Vasilis Ntranos](https://github.com/pachterlab/scRNA-Seq-TCC-prep/blob/master/README.md). Arguably this has nothing to do with salmon/kallisto though I think the kallisto guys were smart to include it. It's a good filter even if only for speeding things up. Then it's really what might be the most appropriate demultiplexing of fastqs to allow compatibility between tecnhiques, I guess. I quite like how the kallisto workflow ends up with a fastq per cell together with a matching UMI file. Then at the very least one can ignore the UMIs (perhaps going with what @vals suggests). Not sure if that's helpful. But thought to chime in as somebody we would love to see salmon working on the high throughput single-cell platforms that have sample, cell and molecular barcodes. Even if only to test how worthwhile UMIs genuinely are for most applications. This may be a controversial comment, but I suspect for me UMIs will largely end up the same way as spike-ins: useful for quantifying endogenous RNA recovered per cell but perhaps not all that useful beyond that for low read depth single-",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/93#issuecomment-265619589:502,throughput,throughput,502,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/93#issuecomment-265619589,1,['throughput'],['throughput']

Performance,"Hi @roryk,. Salmon doesn't currently have the ability to output a pseudobam, but that is definitely possible (and not too difficult). We have a related feature planned; perhaps you could tell me if it suits your use case. However, first, I should mention that if you'd simply like a pseudobam for _all_ the mapping locations of the reads, you can use [RapMap](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/RapMap). RapMap implements the quasi-mapping algorithm upon which Salmon and Sailfish are based (and RapMap is used as a library in the Salmon and Sailfish codebases). Given an index and set of reads, RapMap will report all of the multi-mapping locations that Salmon and Sailfish would consider during quantification. The other feature we have in the works is to have Salmon optionally output a `.bam` file (with actual alignments) post-quantification. It turns out that, given the quasi-mapping information and the quantification results, taking the extra step from quasi-mapping to an actual _alignment_ can be done fairly efficiently. In this mode, Salmon would make one more pass over the reads and, considering the estimated abundances, sample a single alignment for each multi-mapping read proportional to the relative abundance of the different multi-mapping targets (i.e. it would perform a sampling over the multi-mapping locations that would, in expectation, give the same abundances as the _soft_ assignments computed by the optimization algorithm). This feature will be very useful for [transrate](https://github.com/Blahah/transrate). However, given that your goal is to use outside information to perform the filtering yourself, this option may not be ideal for you.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/38#issuecomment-175092553:1280,perform,perform,1280,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/38#issuecomment-175092553,6,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimization', 'perform']"

However, given our limited access to QuantSeq and our limited (student) bandwidth to do extensive testing on alternative tech, we have kept this flag marked as experimental. As I mention above, it was introduced since, _conceptually_, the QuantSeq protocol should not exhibit a length effect and so the one may not wish to account for the length when determining assignment probabilities during the variational Bayesian optimization. However, the empirical testing of this has been limited. Now that your paper is published, and contains what look to be some _very through_ assessment methodologies, we may be able to look into this and determine if there is anything we can do to, perhaps, optimize salmon even more for accurate quantification from the QuantSeq protocol.

Performance,"Hi @sagnikbanerjee15,. > We are using Salmon to quantify gene counts for samples in RNA-Seq experiment. We will be using the weights of the equivalence class to perform a calculation for which we require the effective length of the equivalence classes. I checked in the eq_class.txt file under the aux_info directory but I was unable to find it. We are using alignment-based method where we supply a bamfile to salmon. Could you please help us to obtain the effective length of the equivalence classes?. An equivalence class is not an object that has a notion of a length or effective length. Specifically, an equivalence class represents a set of transcripts to which a set of fragments map or align. If you are using the range-factorized equivalence classes (which is what salmon uses by default internally), these represent a set of transcripts to which a set of fragments map or align with very similar conditional probability vectors. Since the equivalence class represents mappings or alignments to a collection of transcripts — where each transcript may have an arbitrarily different length — there is no such thing as the notion of the ""effective length"" of an equivalence class. Note that the sequence that induces an equivalence class need not even be a contiguous region of the underlying reference (see answer below), and thus the notion of an effective length (or a length in general) is not applicable here. > I have another question. Salmon operates in both lightweight alignment mode and in alignment mode. For the lightweight mode, one needs to first create an index (which is the colored De Bruijn graph). I understand that this index (along with all the equivalence class) remains the same even when gene counts of different RNA-Seq samples are estimated. But I am a bit confused about the alignment-based method. In this case, salmon does not require an index since it has the actual alignments.

Performance,"Hi @satta,. Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I am of two minds on this proposal. On one hand, I agree that it is cleaner, in theory, to have a RapMap shared library to which Salmon could simply link. Currently, Salmon pulls in the relevant portions of the RapMap code to call what is essentially an ill-defined public API for mapping. On the other hand, I have two concerns about separating the code at this point, one is major the other minor. The major concern is that both Salmon and RapMap are still very much under active development, core code and even the interfaces are undergoing reasonably rapid changes (thus the versioning < 1.0). This allows me to easily add features that may potentially benefit Salmon to the RapMap codebase, and then to synchronize Salmon releases with particular commits (tags) in the RapMap codebase. The current build system makes it very easy to pull in the appropriately versioned RapMap code. On the other hand, I have very little experience in properly versioning shared libraries so I would have to understand that better and how this could be done without complicating the build process. My _minor_ concern is that I don't know what effect, if any, separating the code into a separate shared library might have on compiler optimizations. Right now, since the relevant RapMap code is compiled alongside Salmon and they are linked together into the same module, certain optimizations may be possible that would not be so when linking to a shared library. My educated guess is that the effect of such optimizations would be negligible, but it's something that may be worth some exploration first.

Performance,"Hi @shalercr,. I agree that if each sample runs as quickly as you see here, it's not a big deal to just re-run them all.

Performance,"Hi @sjackman , Thanks for you question. It is indeed a good observation to use salmon for combining separate CB and read-sequence fastq files.; Having said that, we have designed alevin to work with, and tested it on 10x-chromium `cellranger` pipeline which itself has a feature similar to mentioned above by you (enabled by flag `--dumpfq`). This feature takes in two separate files: one with CB+UMI and another with read-sequence, and performs initial whitelisting (knee based , more intelligent whitelisting happens downstream and needs deduplicated UMI counts or one can just optionally provide external whitelist), error corrects the CB, attaches it to the header (although not with tag `BX:Z`) of the read-sequence in the second file, and dumps it to the standard out. I might have to read a bit about `longranger` and its `FASTQ` format, but if you are familiar with the `longranger` pipeline and are sure that it uses 16+10 (CB+UMI) in one file and read-sequence in the second file, then I think you are good to try alevin with `--dumpfq` flag.

Performance,"Hi @tamuanand ,. I think these are very important question and thanks for raising the issue.; As you mention, In the preprint we put out two different modes of Selective Alignment:; A) SA: The mashmap and bedtools based pipeline which follows old [SalmonTools](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/SalmonTools/blob/master/README.md) based pipeline.; B) SAF: Inbuilt salmon pipeline to consume genome and follows [this](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2019/selective-alignment/) pipeline. The distinction between the two comes from how the decoy sequence are actually generated. To answer your question point wise.; 1.) That's correct SAF based pipeline follows the tutorial as mentioned in B above and uses the full genome as decoys.; 2.) That's correct, if a user wan't to run SA method, then they should follow mashmap based tutorial A. This might be useful for situation where the index is too big to fit into the machine's memory.; 3.) That's also correct, yes if you don't provide decoys `-d` you can still run salmon on the transcriptome. We have just enabled the validateMapping option by default, which is also used in transcriptome only mode, currently there is no option to _disable_ it.; 4) That's also correct, we have dropped the quasi-mapping based support from the latest version, If you need to run quasi we have released `0.15` just as a last version into the archive.; 5 & 6) Very good question, short answer is your default pipeline of VBEM is the recommended way. We have to use additional flags `--mimicBT2 and --useEM` while comparing the methods in the preprint.

Just to follow-up / expand a bit on what @k3yavi has said (and to answer your other question): Yes, one would imagine that, given the details of the QuantSeq protocol, turning off length correction would make the most sense. The main reason this flag is listed as _experimental_, is simply that it was designed based on the expected characteristics of the protocol. Conceptually, the protocol is performing tagged-end sequencing, and so there should be little-to-no length effect. However, since we haven't done extensive internal validation on QuantSeq data, we have left this flag as experimental until it is further tested by ourselves or others. > Also @rob-p , weren't you referring to the RSEM caveat with QuantSeq data analysis wherein one cannot ask RSEM to disable lengthCorrection and hence the count statistics might be misleading?. Correct; as far as we are aware, there is no way to disable the built-in length-dependent assumptions of RSEM. One could use the `--estimate-rspd` flag to allow learning of a non-uniform read distribution (the equivalent of `--posBias` in salmon), though it's unclear / unlikely if this would be as effective as fully disabling the length correction for this type of tagged-end data.

Alevin solves the problem pretty well for protocols where fragmentation of the cDNA molecule happens post PCR amplification. There might be some concerns about over-deduplication of the UMI if fragmenation happens before amplification. Although in current form, Illumina sample index can be given as an external whitelist to Alevin but user should be aware that Alevin performs a sequence correction step before starting any optimizations.; Alevin is designed for droplets based protocols, where one end of Paired end read is just the CB/UMI (i.e. no read sequence) and therefore Alevin can’t optimally use the full paired end information of the bulk 3' protocol if its both end has read-sequence for example the ambiguous mapping resolution based on a previously/empirically known approximate fragment length.

Reports like this are a model of what every developer wishes a user did before filing an issue :). First, let me clear up what seems like might be a small source of confusion. Since both of the salmon runs are from v1.1.0, _neither_ of these are making use of quasi-mapping. Specifically, newer versions of salmon _only_ perform selective alignment (and this makes the `--validateMappings` command line argument redundant in newer versions, though we keep it so as to maximize backward compatibility with command line parameters people may be using). So, the main difference between your two salmon runs is inclusion of the decoy set. This almost certainly means that the reads that map in your second set of salmon runs but not your first are being assigned to decoys in the first case. To try and get a better handle on this, could you upload a `meta_info.json` file from both runs? This file lives in the `aux_info` directory, and it will provide information about e.g. how many reads were best mapped to decoys and were discarded for this reason. The guarantee you get from the selective alignment is that, if the fragment is discarded by decoy mapping, it maps _strictly better_ to the decoy than to the non-decoy sequence. There are many reasons this could happen. One is rRNA contamination, another could be that reads are coming from processed pseudogenes that are not properly in your annotation, yet a third is that your sample has a considerable fraction of reads spanning exon-intron junctions (in this case, the read will map better to the corresponding location on the genome, and worse to the annotate transcript where the intronic sequence is not present). Now, figuring out exactly which of these cases you are in is a bit more difficult, but one approach would be to pick one of the samples with the biggest differences and map to the reads to the genome with e.g. STAR or HISAT2 to see what y",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/479#issuecomment-578848875:411,perform,perform,411,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/479#issuecomment-578848875,2,['perform'],['perform']
Performance,"Hi Nick,. No problem at all; sorry for not providing a better explanation (I'm planning on writing one up for when this feature is listed in the next official release). In terms of strategy, my recommendation would be to use the default (the `dense hash`) unless indexing memory becomes a problem. The main differences are the following:; - The perfect hash uses an external memory algorithm to construct the hash function, and so requires less memory.; - Because the perfect hash function is built in external memory, **construction** of the hash using this data structure is sower. I don't have longitudinal benchmarks, but it is somewhere between 2 and 5x slower to populate the perfect hash than the dense hash.; - Once constructed, the perfect hash is _considerably_ smaller, and so quantification on an index built using a perfect hash will require only ~50% of the memory that is required when using a dense hash. Obviously if you're quantifying on the same machine that was able to build the index, this isn't a problem. However, if you're shipping the index to smaller memory computers, then this is something to consider.; - The performance difference in terms of mapping speed is very minimal; the minimum perfect hash can be 5-10% slower than the dense hash, but this difference is usually only a matter of seconds. Also, the total runtime difference can be even less since the smaller perfect hash can be read more quickly from disk than the larger dense hash. So, the standard recommendation would be use the default unless you run into memory problems building the index; in that case, try enabling the `--perfectHash` flag.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/53#issuecomment-204069238:1139,perform,performance,1139,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/53#issuecomment-204069238,1,['perform'],['performance']

Performance,"Hi Stephen,. So, the variation you see when you re-run salmon multiple times is _expected_ to be different (and _much_ smaller) than the variance you see when bootstrapping. Why is this? When you re-run salmon, the only variance you are seeing is due to small differences in the order of observations / updates from the streaming collapsed variational Bayes phase of the algorithm. This, in turn can have a _slight_ effect on the initialization conditions of the offline phase of the algorithm, and some of the parameters learned for the auxiliary parameters. However, in each run, you are observing _exactly_ the same set of reads and salmon is producing _exactly_ the same set of alignments; only the order and therefore some of the streaming updates change. So, we expect the final estimated abundances to be _very_ similar to each other. However, when salmon performs bootstrapping, it is actually resampling _with replacement_, from the counts of the range-factorized equivalence classes. Roughly, we expect this resampling to be similar to if we re-sampled _with replacement_ from the original set of input reads. That is, we are re-sampling from our population sample — the observed set of reads — to estimate the variance due to inference. So, for the bootstrap re-samplings, we expect significantly more variance than between subsequent runs of salmon, because the observations from which we are making the inference are actually changing. It is possible e.g. that some uniquely mapped reads may not be chosen in some bootstrap sample (since we are re-sampling the observed read count, but doing so _with replacement_), and so the estimates of sets of related isoforms will change in those samples. Thus, since the observations themselves are changing, we expect the estimates to display greater variance. In fact, this is the main goal of performing the bootstrapping (or Gibbs sampling) — to estimate the uncertainty due to inference if we had observed many reads coming from the same under",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/466#issuecomment-568828362:863,perform,performs,863,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/466#issuecomment-568828362,2,['perform'],['performs']
Performance,"Hi Victor,. Is it the case that `/n/data1/cores/bcbio/ej_rnaseq/tCells_KO/work/spikein/Flox5YFP0_B07_R/index` is an index of only your genes of interest? If so, that would explain what you're seeing. Salmon assumes that some non-zero fraction of reads map in your sample. In this case, I'd presume that if you have some samples where no reads map to any transcript of your gene of interest, then salmon will complain in exactly the manner mentioned above. Now that I think about it, there are actually two different scenarios that can cause the above. The first is if something goes wrong in the optimization (there should be no way for this to happen, and so it would be the result of a bug if it did). The second is actually if there are no mappable reads. That's not the result of a bug, or even an ""error"" per-se, but just very unexpected input (since, in a typical scenario, this would imply the reads are unmatched with the reference). It might make sense to handle this case separately. However, this is certainly what is causing the output in your case, and you can safely assume that here, were it not for this specific check, Salmon would return an estimated count of 0 for all transcripts in the index.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/119#issuecomment-278743839:596,optimiz,optimization,596,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/119#issuecomment-278743839,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Performance,"Hi!; This is probably not a question for the github, but I wasn't sure where to post; (please redirect me, and I'll happily remove it). I had one small question related to the paper; https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v1. When performing the benchmarking of all different approaches, the parameters used when testing STAR+Salmon are listed of course. It's mentioned that the parameters of STAR are meant to be kept the same as RSEM uses them in order to get the actual proper comparisons.; All the parameters do look the same, except for one; --sjdbScore; In your paper, this param is not being used, which means that the default value of 2 is active.; RSEM, however, sets this to 1. . I'm not sure if this will affect the results in any major way though, so I just wanted to check if there was maybe a reason behind leaving this value to 2 in the paper. The --sjdbScore value scores alignments with annotated junctions higher over unspliced alignments. ; I'm not even actually sure why RSEM lowers this to 1. ; I was trying to replicate some of your benchmarking, and I was just curious about this one if you have any info that can help out. And again, I probably don't need to mention it anymore, but awesome job with the Salmon!

Performance,"Hi,. I am using Salmon to quantify single cell RNA-seq data using quasi-mapping. Therefore, I have many different FastQ files (288 to be exact), each for a different cell. Many files have less than a million reads. . I am concerned that performing the 3 bias corrections would introduce a systematic bias in itself between the samples, if the corrections are performed independently on each sample. I imagine that this would cause the read counts to be adjusted to different extents in different samples. This is compounded by the fact that number of reads in different files are so different as that might affect the sampling needed to measure bias. Ideally, I imagine the bias corrections should be performed on all 288 samples as a whole together. i.e. I concatenate all 288 FastQ files and run salmon on the concatenated file. But I would not be able to de-multiplex the reads afterwards.",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/165:237,perform,performing,237,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/165,3,['perform'],"['performed', 'performing']"
Performance,"Hi,. I am using Salmon v 1.10.1 do perform selective alignment on paired end RNAseq samples and I have trouble to interpret the output statistics (i.e succesfully mapped pairs ....); Here is my command line on a sample containing 34,462,097 pairs (After cleaning, adapter removal, rRNA trimming). **salmon quant -i $IndexDir -l A -1 $forward -2 $reverse -p 8 --seqBias --gcBias –useVBOpt --discardOrphansQuasi –consensusSlack 0.35 --minScoreFraction 0.8 --decoyThreshold 1 -o $OutputDir/$pairname_Output**. Here is the the output statistics of the alignment; [Salmon_quant_output.txt](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/files/11768911/Salmon_quant_output.txt). So I have few questions : . 1- Where is idicated the numer of processed pairs, i.e. the number of pairs in the sample ?. 2- Does the mapping rate correspond to the reads that will be used for the quantification (i.e. succesfully mapped and that were above every filtering thresholds) or this % also takes into account the discarded mapping ? This is of great importance to tell if the mapping step is good or not. 3- Counted 20,588,460 total reads in the equivalence classes What does this mean ? Is it the numner of pairs that mapped (discarded and not discarded or only the ones that are kept for quentification). 4- What is the difference between mapping discarded and fragment discarded ? To count the number if pairs that did not map to my reference should I sum Number of mappings discarded because of alignment score + Number of fragments entirely discarded because of alignment score + Number of fragments discarded because they are best-mapped to decoys + Number of fragments discarded because they have only dovetail (discordant) mappings to valid targets.

The mapping rates I got are ~50-65%...Here are some of the reasons for low mapping rates based on previous posts:. 1. rRNA contamination: In my case, rRNAs were removed during library construction, also I quantified rRNA contents in my trimmed reads, and it's very low (<5%).; 2. DNA contamination: This is possible, I got ~98% genome mapping rate using hisat2. But in fact, DNAs are removed in my RNA extraction process...and poly-T was used to select mRNAs during the library construction...; 3. Not using pre-mature transcripts so reads mapping to introns are discarded: I am not sure if this is a valid point since we usually quantify mature mRNAs, not pre-mature ones.; 4.

Performance,"I see, we might have to tweak a bit based on the use case for `longranger basic`.; In `v0.10`, alevin should still be able to do CB correction, and attach the corrected CBs to the header of the second file, although the remaining template sequence (128 bases) from the first file might get loss, since `cellranger` was using template sequencing in only one file. Like @rob-p was saying we can work on making this step more generalized, once we confirm that the error-correction model for `cellranger` and `longranger` can be used interchangeably. In theory we can still concatenate the remaining 128 bases into an interleaved format since alevin has hidden options to provide the lengths explicitly but we have not tested this feature extensively. We will keep this at the top of our feature-request list and would inform you as soon as we have a stable version with this feature. Thanks again for the interest !!. re: *interleaved format* -- indeed an interleave format does makes sense and should be the default dumping format, but I believe since the default mode of 10x's `mkfastq` is to dump separate `FASTQ`, we should not use resources to create an interim interleaved format and then consume it downstream (since`FASTQ` itself is not very efficient), instead, in alevin we just consume the two separate `FASTQ` into our own interim data-structure to perform the downstream analysis.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/233#issuecomment-395195411:1358,perform,perform,1358,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/233#issuecomment-395195411,1,['perform'],['perform']
Performance,"I see. TopHat actually aligns the reads to the genome (using Bowtie and a strategy to perform split-read mapping). The results of TopHat, then, are meant to be used with tools like Cufflinks, which expects reads to be mapped directly to the genome rather than to the transcriptome. Salmon, on the other hand, works like tools such as RSEM / eXpress, which expect alignments to the transcriptome directly. This can be accomplished by either mapping the reads directly to the transcript sequences (using e.g. Bowtie2 / BWA-MEM) or by mapping the reads to the genome using a tool such as STAR, and telling it to project the alignments onto genomic coordinates. However, I should mention that the easiest thing to do is to simply have Salmon build and index on your transcript set and then pass it the raw (compressed) FASTQ files directly. Since Salmon provides an accurate and lightweight alignment proxy, it can accurately assess transcript abundance estimates directly from the raw (unaligned) sequenced reads. If you have questions about using either of these modes, please take a look at [the documentation](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Additionally, I tend to see IO saturation over our NFS pool from just streaming the FASTQ data to salmon, so you might still be screwed even if you take care of the index IO contribution. Your machines should likely be caching the index in RAM (if you have enough of it) after one access, but you can use a tool to force caching of the index file if you really want (https://serverfault.com/questions/43383/caching-preloading-files-on-linux-into-ram).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/319#issuecomment-442180390:133,load,loading,133,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/319#issuecomment-442180390,1,['load'],['loading']

Performance,"I understand that salmon does not use read quality scores when performing alignment/quantitation but, as it stands, running with `--writeMappings` it also doesn't output the qualities in its SAM-format output. That may not impact most downstream applications of the data but it does limit some. I'd be particularly interested in using reads that have been aligned and assigned to transcripts with an EM algorithm to investigate RNA editing. The most advanced methods of doing this integrate the quality of base calls from the sequencer into the models and, as such, cannot currently run on the data output. Although it may save a few CPU cycles in not reading and outputting the qualities - I can understand the choice when running with default settings - when running with `--writeMappings` that nominal difference in speed needs to be weighed up against downstream utility.

Further, the output you printed around the exception happens at the start of program execution, so I don't understand the timeline of events here for a single run / execution.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/512#issuecomment-618093803:345,load,loading,345,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/512#issuecomment-618093803,1,['load'],['loading']
Performance,"I'm planning on using your wonderful Salmon tool v0.12.0 for generating TPM counts with a view to quantifying relative abundance of certain bacterial antibiotic resistance genes in my shotgun (human gut) metagenomes. So as to ensure strict mappings to the genes of interest, I would like to set the value of the flag '--minScoreFraction' to 0.90. Since its a metagenome with a truck-load of genes from several microbes, I plan to quantify only those genes that show >=90% identity at the nucleotide-level to the known antibiotic resistance genes (of interest). My question here really is whether setting the flag minScoreFraction to 0.90 achieves anything close to what I've in mind? Below is the full command line I used for Salmon-based quantification of the tetracycline resistance gene tetW. salmon quant --meta -i amr_indices/tetW_index -l A -1 Corr_clean_phiclean_10_8_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz -2 Corr_clean_phiclean_10_8_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz -o 10_tetW_test_quant --mimicStrictBT2 --validateMappings --minScoreFraction=0.90.

Performance,"Ok @DarwinAwardWinner, I think it's fixed for real this time. The issue was stemming from an uninitialized prior value in the Gibbs sampler under VBOpt mode (the initialization code was updated on the develop branch, which is where the bug was introduced). This, in turn, was leading to `nan` being passed as the alpha parameter of `std::gamma_distribution`. With the `-Ofast` optimization flags, at least, this leads `std::gamma_distribution()` to hang forever in an infinite loop. Clearly, `nan` should not be passed to `std::gamma_distribution()`, but I'd argue the behavior of looping forever here is not great. Anyway, I fixed the initialization bug, so that this nan should never pop up. Just to be safe, I also changed the default optimization flag to `-O3` so that at least `nan` and `inf` can be properly tested. Since the TBB code and the parallel sampling weren't causing the issue, I've added them back in. Could you please test the latest push (40584e62859fb65463188b50d132c1eb622b21f0) and verify that this resolves the issue for you (*hopefully*!)?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/111#issuecomment-267877253:377,optimiz,optimization,377,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/111#issuecomment-267877253,2,['optimiz'],['optimization']
Performance,"Ok all; another update. The issue I raise above still exists (differences between calls to `ksw_extz` and `ksw_extz2sse`). *However*, I think that what is happening in this case is actually explained more simply. That is, the positions being reported by salmon are _correct_ given the optimal alignment. Specifically, salmon is performing an end-to-end alignment of the read, and the optimal alignment here includes an indel of length 3 in the initial portion of the read. If we were outputting the CIGAR string along with the position, then the bases would line up because the ""off by 3"" issue that happens above for the reads would be addressed when walking the CIGAR. However, we don't (currently) output the CIGAR — rather, we output a decoy CIGAR that does not represent the optimal alignment as computed by ksw2. So, if we assume all matches / mismatches (an indel-free prefix for this read), then we see the position shift noted in the initial bug report. I think the easiest solution, for the time being at least, is to report the position as if the prefix before the first MEM is indel free under the optimal alignment (even if it is not and the optimal score reflects that). However, if there are other suggestions for the best way to address this, I'm open to those as well.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/475#issuecomment-574719940:328,perform,performing,328,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/475#issuecomment-574719940,2,['perform'],['performing']

Targets may link only to libraries. CMake is dropping the item.**; **WARNING: Target ""unitTests"" requests linking to directory ""/users/work/jake/bin/zlib-1.2.11/"". Targets may link only to libraries. CMake is dropping the item.**. So I actually went back a step and check my initial cmake command in the ../salmon-0.8.2/build/ directory. It also had the same issue and therefore wasn't building correctly. I started the install again from ../salmon-0.8.2/build/ using the following: . cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=/users/work/jake/bin/boost_1_64_0/ -DZLIB_LIBRARY=/users/work/jake/bin/zlib-1.2.11/zlib.h .. . It seemed to work nicely and I got all the build files to propagate into the ../salmon-0.8.2/build/ directory. From here I ran 'make' which did a whole bunch of things I hadn't seen it do yet, so assumably it was working as intended. This is until it got to the following stage:.

Performance,"Oki, so I have updated a couple of things in the latest commit on the develop branch, which should make the things more streamlined. . * `maxNumBarcodes`: As you have initially used `maxNumBarcodes` which is by default set to 100k it means. by default alevin quantifies 100k CBs which includes both the low and high confidence CB count. You can change this number accordingly to set the universe of the top CB to quantify.; * `KeepCBFraction` : It defines what fraction of `maxNumBarcodes` to be used as the high confidence barcodes and should definitely generate the quants for. If set to 1 then everything is high confidence and the whitelisting cannot be performed. Thanks to this issue, alevin will not fail without error when there is no low confidence CB is found instead it checks if the number of low confidence CB is less than `lowRegionMinBarcodes` (default to 200), alevin will warn and not perform the whitelisting.; * `freqThreshold`: This is used to filter out most obvious cases to filter out CB with frequency less than set by the parameter (default to 10). Hope this help ! I am also testing on my end for any other potential bug.

I did the salmon quantification both with and without using seq_bias and gc_bias corrections and got the same result. Info for both included.

Performance,"Right, in short `salmon index -t txome_fasta -i txome_index` should work and both the versions of salmon (v0.15 and v1.0) is available on bioconda, check [here](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/salmon/README.html), you may wanna try [force](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/update.html) update of conda. I think the confusion is you are thinking of the concept of Selective Alignment as the same as aligning to transcriptome w/ decoys (can be genome or mashmap based). Although they are related methods but the concept of Selective Alignment predates the idea of decoy based alignment, checkout [this](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3233589) paper from our lab where we discuss how Selectively Aligning difficult reads to just the transcriptome itself can result in improved quantification estimates compared to quasi or pseduo alignment. To summarize: ; In version 1.0; A) SA: The mashmap and bedtools based pipeline which follows old SalmonTools based pipeline.; B) SAF: Inbuilt salmon pipeline to consume genome and follows this pipeline.; C) If you don't provide any decoys, salmon will do Selective Alignment just on the transcriptome. The Release notes you quoted just means you cannot disable this feature i.e. you cannot fall back to quasi-mapping (in quasi mapping there is no alignment of the reads at all). In version 0.15.0; You cannot provide decoys and the transcriptome based mapping performed in this version would be quasi-mapping i.e. no Alignment of reads.

Performance,"Salmon has two modes; alignment-based and quasi-mapping based. When you are using the alignment-based mode (i.e. feeding it a BAM file of aligned reads), you don't need to provide it with the raw reads. This is because all of the relevant information is already contained within the BAM file. . On the other hand, in quasi-mapping mode, you index the set of reference transcripts (using `salmon index`) and then provide salmon with the location of the index and the raw reads (i.e. the FASTQ file). In this case, it performs quasi-mapping (a lightweight stand in for alignment), and so it is not necessary to provide the BAM file.

Performance,"So, I am still very surprised by the 45G number, but one big difference here is that the refgenomes indices are with the default value of k (`k=31`). As you can see, the dominant element of the index here is the `ctable.bin`, which stores where unitigs of the dBG start within each reference. As the k-met size gets smaller, unitigs get shorter, and they appear more places. Further, the increase here is not linear as `k` decreases. I’d suspect most of the size difference is due to that. There is also an optimization for the `ctable.bin` that we have been working on that wastes fewer bits, and will make this part of the index somewhat smaller in such cases. However, I am fairly certain that is not the dominant factor here. You could see what this is with the default `k`; I’d expect that to be closer to the refgenomes number (but perhaps a bit different due to version differences and the `—keepDuplicates` flag).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/505#issuecomment-613226163:507,optimiz,optimization,507,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/505#issuecomment-613226163,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

So if I am right,; it is possible to summarize this quantification at the level of UMIs,; and have an idea of the duplication level of the transcripts that have; been tagged with UMIs.

Performance,"Thank you for the swift answer!. We are working with [BD Rhapsody](https://www.bdbiosciences.com/en-us/instruments/research-instruments/single-cell-multiomics/single-cell-analysis-system), which uses a complex barcode structure (you can read about this in their [bioinformatics handbook](https://www.bd.com/documents/guides/user-guides/GMX_BD-Rhapsody-genomics-informatics_UG_EN.pdf) on page 14). The extracted, combined CB is 27bp long, which is why the default sanity check was too low for our purposes. In terms of cell numbers, BD Rhapsody appears to generate a lot of ""false-positive cells"", actually (we are seeing up to 90% of false positives). This is expected, and also mentioned in their bioinformatics handbook (pages 23-25), but appears to be an issue for the alevin cell detection: with standard settings this is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than expected, `--expectCells` improves matters drastically, however. We have opted for removing the false positives in post-processing ourselves - the low count depth population is very easily identifiable.

Performance,"Thanks @rob-p,. Your explanations are helpful, and I think it may my concern may just be more associated with your general thought as I've tested this with multiple parameters. The one I represented here was just an example, but I also can see how the parameters can be affecting these results. It was just strange to see such a huge shift with the addition/removal of one gene, which makes me think it more associated with how the inference of the variables are conditioned. . As for providing the meta_info.json files, I currently have thousands of them as I am running triplicates of ~150 parameter combinations for multiple tissue types and stages. In the end I don't think it will be necessary as we will likely be changing our approach a bit, which should be fine with the system I have in place. . Also, as for `--scoreExp` our main goal is to try and use Salmon to get quantification of individual genes (primary versus spliced forms). From my analysis, it appears that some genes perform better with scores > 0, however, some genes do perform better with a `--scoreExp` of 0. Although, this could be a factor in running Salmon with such a narrow view (i.e. two transcripts and some housekeeping genes) and might not be the case as more genes are added to the run.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/523#issuecomment-633062608:989,perform,perform,989,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/523#issuecomment-633062608,2,['perform'],['perform']
Performance,"Thanks @roryk and @k3yavi . The issue we have is that we're trying to run a pipeline in a fairly high-throughput manner to get a sensible 'enough' matrix without too much manual intervention. So I'm trying to avoid anything that requires an eyeballing step, accepting that the matrix we get will be less optimal than one you'd get from manual optimisation. Where possible, our curators are extracting the expected cell numbers from publications, so sometimes I have at least a general idea of where to look for an elbow/ feature. @roryk - have you used your alternate view on the data to automatically derive cutoffs? Does it work well?. @k3yavi:. As I say, first point is that this is for cases where I have a rough idea of the target cell number- we're generally working with pre-published data (though cell numbers per run are not always available). . From https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/340 I'd inferred that --expectCells gives Alevin ballpark to look for a knee within, while --forceCells is a strict cuttoff. Is that correct? . That being the case, my thought was to try --expectCells first, and failing that --forceCells. The problem is that I need to parse the STDOUT/ERR to detect the boundary error from --expectCells, which is not a very robust way of doing things.

Performance,"Thanks for the quick response. I see the confusion. **In general, it is not possible to determine which reads are assigned to which transcripts given just the information in the SAM file written by `--writeMappings`**. This is because allocation of reads to transcripts is performed using a probabilistic model that takes into account many factors, so it's not as if salmon is just applying some filter to the mappings and then summing up some alignments. One way you could potentially get more insight is to use the [`postmaster`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/postmaster) tool. It takes as input the SAM file generated by the `--writeMappings` flag of `salmon`, and produces another SAM file annotating each alignment record with a `ZW` field, which records the posterior probability that this read is assigned to the corresponding transcript. This will give the right abundances in expectation (if you sum up the `ZW` field for each alignment, you should get something similar to the `quant.sf` results), but it is not guaranteed to be exactly the same assignment that salmon makes for each alignment itself.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/799#issuecomment-1245730911:273,perform,performed,273,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/799#issuecomment-1245730911,1,['perform'],['performed']
Performance,"Thanks for the response. . The transcriptional variants I've been interested often are quite similar (e.g. only differ for a small part of one exon). Therefore, many of the reads (especially when they map to parts of the genes that don't differ) show up as pseudoaligned to multiple variants, as you'd expect. In that case, do you suggest only looking at the uniquely mapped reads, or only looking at primary alignments for each read, or still looking at all reads (perhaps with a certain `AS` score) for a given transcript? I'm mostly interested in performing sanity checks that transcriptional variants identified by Salmon/Swish are differentially used across conditions. Or would it be better to use a tool like DEXSeq to asks these questions directly? . Also, when filtering by the `AS`, I found some reads with `AS:i:-2147483648`, which I assume is an overflow error.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/528#issuecomment-639153957:550,perform,performing,550,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/528#issuecomment-639153957,1,['perform'],['performing']
Performance,"Thanks for the thorough suggestions. Actually, we fall into the easier case since Salmon does not support mixing single and paired-end reads in a single BAM file. When performing quantification on a single sample, the reads for that sample must follow a uniform library type. For paired-end reads, the BAM file can contain paired-end and single-end alignments (i.e. orphans), but the reads must all have been paired _in sequencing_. Mixing different library types in the BAM file makes it difficult to assess the compatibility of a fragment with the expected library type, especially if fragments from the different library types are expected to exist in a specific ratio in the input. Anyway, my main motivation for having the separate `AS` and `AP` types was to prevent the need to ""peek"" in the file, since, currently, there is not an easy way to peek the first read without opening the first file twice. However, I've decided that the benefit of having the same uniform (and simpler) interface of `A` always representing automatic library type detection is probably worth it, so I've pushed this implementation (commit 6116b2a). So, when the user provides the `A` library type, Salmon will peek into the first record in the BAM file to determine if the fragment was paired in sequencing or not, and will then set the single / paired-end status on that basis. The only corollary to this is that, in alignment-based mode, the `A` flag is not compatible with an input stream (i.e. the input must be a regular file). I will be sure to document this when I update the docs for the version bump.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/79#issuecomment-242399463:168,perform,performing,168,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/79#issuecomment-242399463,2,['perform'],['performing']

Performance,"That is . . . strange! Salmon _literally_ uses the RapMap index (and the RapMap functions) directly to obtain the quasi-mappings. One thing I noticed is that you seem to be using `pseudoindex` which is our independent re-implementation of pseudo-alignment. However, Salmon (and Sailfish) use quasi-mapping (RapMap's `quasiindex` and `quasimap` commands, as [we found this to be more accurate](http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/01/16/029652.full.pdf)). I presume that if you used the quasi-mapping functionality, you might observe the bug. If you don't (i.e. if RapMap performs quasi-mapping properly), then this is a real thinker (and I'd be happy to take a look myself if you can share the file). P.S. The same caveat I mentioned above may apply. That is, it is possible that a polyA transcript that is completely removed from the input could cause a problem unless we check for it in the quasi-index, but may not affect the pseudo-index. This is because the quasi-index relies on a packed representation of the transcriptome and an associated sparse bit-vector to perform the mapping, and it assumes that all of the transcripts will have a non-zero length (if this is the culprit, it is, of course, easy to fix with an explicit check). You could also test this hypothesis by generating the quasi-index with the `--noClip` option, which will disable poly-A clipping when building the index.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/37#issuecomment-175088841:580,perform,performs,580,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/37#issuecomment-175088841,2,['perform'],"['perform', 'performs']"

Performance,"The use case is to allow using [SoupX](https://github.com/constantAmateur/SoupX) which removes ambient reads from cell lysis (the soup). Here is what SoupX does with cellranger output:. 1) loads the .mtx file in the `raw_gene_bc_matrices` directory output by cellranger as argument `tod` to `SoupX::SoupChannel`. . 2) Subsets this matrix to those in `barcodes.tsv` inside the `filtered_gene_bc_matrices` directory as the argument to `toc`. It looks like to use SoupX with alevin would require quantification for all barcodes, not just those that pass the initial alevin whitelist. I guess I would need alevin to perform the initial whitelisting (to get the `toc` argument to `SoupX::SoupChannel`), but then ignore it and quantify all barcodes so that the `tod` matrix can be provided. The approach I am currently using:. 1) Run `alevin --keepCBFraction 1 --maxNumBarcodes 4294967295` to get quants for all barcodes. 2) rerun alevin normally to get whitelisted cells (both from initial and final whitelisting).

Performance,"There should be easy ways to handle reading line-buffered input from two file descriptors, where both file descriptors could be identical, and then passing these streams internally to buffers to be chunked for multithreaded processing. This would give you one code path for ingesting data, and the command line interface could remain the same as it is currently, with the possible addition of mapping the `-` symbol to `/dev/fd/0`. Is there really much to be gained from buffering all input in byte chunks up front? Remembering that unix pipes are buffered somewhat by default anyway? There has to be an acceptable way to handle line-based input in a more flexible way. In Python I would do:. ``` python; import argparse. example_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(); example_parser.add_argument('-fq1', type=argparse.FileType('r')); example_parser.add_argument('-fq2', type=argparse.FileType('r')); args = parser.parse_args(). for line1, line2 in zip(args.fq1, args.fq2):; do_stuff_with_lines(); ```. You could then call the program flexibly:. ``` bash; $ example -fq1 file1.fq -fq2 file2.fq; $ example -fq1 <(gzip -dc file1.fq.gz) -fq2 <(gzip -dc file2.fq.gz); $ other_interleaved_process | example -fq1 - -fq2 -; ```. The caveat for the code above is that you would want to replace `argparse.FileType` with some class that reads 4 lines at a time - I'm sure there's no shortage of Python FASTQ readers that do that. And I know that you're looking for C++ libraries that perform well for your purposes, and my Python example is just a toy, but I think designing the option parser to at least **accept** streams and file-like objects and handle them using the same code path would be a worthy reason to refactor a bit.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/29#issuecomment-168545456:1471,perform,perform,1471,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/29#issuecomment-168545456,1,['perform'],['perform']

Performance,"Well, one can certainly use a tool (like gffread or rsem-prepare-reference) to take a genome and a (possibly custom/augmented) GTF to extract a set of target transcripts. Above, it looks like you were only processing between 90 and 100k transcripts. Given the overall size of the overall reference — ~2.4 billion nucleotides — my guess would be that some of these transcripts may be exceedingly long (and perhaps extracted incorrectly from the underlying tool). I should note that an index can be built on large references (which is why we support 64-bit index construction), but it's a very rare use-case as most transcriptomes (even large _de novo_ transcriptomes) rarely cross the 2^31 barrier, and I would expect it to consume quite a bit of memory. The default `quasi` indexer of Salmon is optimized to be very fast for typical sized transcriptomes (usually a few hundred mega-bases) at the cost of using more memory. The alternative `fmd` index can be made more memory efficient, by setting a larger sampling factor, but the resulting mapping will be slower (though still much faster than standard alignment). I would first check to see if the transcripts.fa file contains what you were expecting (i.e. the normal transcriptome + the auxiliary transcripts you were interested in quantifying), and that you actually have close to 2.4Gb of non-redundant transcriptome sequence that you want to quantify. If this is the case, the options are to try and build the quasi-index on a large memory machine (building the index requires more memory than mapping with the constructed index), or using the fmd-index with a large sampling factor.

Performance,"Why am I seeing much higher values for this gene with FeatureCounts?. I have now run FeatureCounts several times with different overlaps (minOverlap =25, minOverlap =50, minOverlap =75min Overlap =100) and indeed the counts have decreased (again the psbI example: 8685 , 6011, 4237, 1805 accordingly). Again, this is a good argument for the hypothesis put forward. >Why does running Salmon outside nf-core lead to much higher values?. Hopefully, after I run Decoy mode, this problem is solved. I also tried mapping mode with the --softclipOverhangs option. That increased the counts (psbI : 4696 counts); playing around with the --minScoreFraction flag in addition to the --softclipOverhangs flag also increased the numbers ( minScoreFraction= 0 ->psbI = 8496; minScoreFraction= 0.5 ->psbI = 5633; minScoreFraction= 0.7 ->psbI =3627 ). . So, in summary, your explanation seems to be completely correct. ; In the case that decoy mode resolves the difference between the pipeline and the run outside the pipeline, I would not give this to the nf-core people. But I will if there are still large discrepancies after the run. I'm still not sure what the best parameters are for my analysis, but the --softclipOverhangs flag seems to be the best option for me now.; So thanks again!. @drpatelh. Thank you very much for your quick reply as well. ; I was a bit inaccurate when I said I used the FeatureCounts from the pipeline. I actually wasn't able to use the resulting .txt files. Instead, I used the resulting bam file from the pipeline to perform a FeatureCounts analysis on R. I hope this information answers the question of how I can compare the two results?; My genome and gtf file are from [EnsemblPlants](https://plants.ensembl.org/Arabidopsis_thaliana/Info/Index), so they should be fine.

Performance,"Yes; precisely. In the alignment-based case, Salmon will infer the library type from the alignments. In the case you mention above (someone performs stranded alignment using an unstranded library), Salmon would incorrectly infer a stranded type, though it would actually be a byproduct of passing incorrect options to the aligner. In the read-based mode, since we have control over both the mapping and quantification steps, we can avoid such an issue. However, it seems to me _ok_ to incorrectly infer a library type if we were passed incorrect alignments in the first place, right?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/79#issuecomment-241813836:140,perform,performs,140,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/79#issuecomment-241813836,1,['perform'],['performs']

Performance,"al `1,099,008` are being discarded because they have only dovetail mappings. . We discard dovetail mappings by default, but you can admit them with `--allowDovetail`. The other `2,776,678` fragments are discarded because, though there are seeds for mapping that match, they do not have sufficiently high alignment score to be allowed for mapping. This default behavior, too, can be modified. The main flags that affect the behavior here are `--minScoreFraction`, where a lower number allows lower-quality alignments through and also the `--softclipOverhangs` flag which will decrease the penalty on alignments that overhang the end of an annotated transcript. However, it's worth noting that this is up to `3,875,686` more reads that might be mappable. This number is non-trivial, but quite far from the 90% rate of STAR. The rest of the reads, however, simply don't have support for alignment against the annotated transcriptome. **This suggests to me that STAR is probably aligning a lot of reads outside of annotated genes**. If you build the salmon index [using a full decoy of the genome](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2019/selective-alignment/), then you might be able to evaluate intergenic mapping in the output in terms of `Number of fragments discarded because they are best-mapped to decoys`. However, in that case, these reads still won't contribute to transcript expression, as they do not align to annotated transcripts. Finally, if you suspect these reads might be coming from genes expressed in your sample but not present in the annotation, you might consider performing a transcript assembly on your data, using a tool like [scallop2](https://github.com/Shao-Group/scallop2) or [stringtie](https://github.com/gpertea/stringtie). Best,; Rob. P.S. I'm closing the thread, since I think the above answers your direct question, but please feel free to continue commenting here (for discussion) or to open up another issue if there are follow-ups that are salmon-related.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/775#issuecomment-1126361719:1778,perform,performing,1778,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/775#issuecomment-1126361719,2,['perform'],['performing']

This, in conjunction with the fact that running with `-l A` suggests incorrectly the data are unstranded (`IU`), led @mikelove to suspect alevin may be skipping the libType guesswork that salmon typically performs. . I know these data are of reasonably good quality, because I have instead processed them using [zUMIs](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs), which supports SPLiT-seq data. A side-by-side of the same FASTQs processed this way using alevin or using zUMIs gave me ~270 cells that pass filters (alevin) vs ~50k cells that pass filters (zUMIs), so something is definitely up here. . I'd like to confirm a few details and ask for some guidance on how to move forward:. 1. Is the reversal of R1/R2 like I did here necessary/recommended/correct?; 2. Is alevin truly skipping the libType identification bits such that I need to know which architecture to use? If so, how do I know?; 3. Why are so many CBs called as ""noisy"" here?; 4. Why is the mapping rate so low?; 5. Is there anything else I'm missing that can explain the unexpectedly poor outcome, or some other reason why this approach will not w",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699:6444,perform,performs,6444,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/699,1,['perform'],['performs']

Performance,"bit on a few of @k3yavi's answers. 1&2) Yes; if you want to use SAF, you no longer need mashmap, as what you are essentially doing is treating the entire genome as a ""decoy"". As @k3yavi alludes, SA is still useful when you need to run in a very memory-constrained environment. After adopting the new [pufferfish-based](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish/tree/develop) index, the size of the transcriptome plush mashmap 2 decoys becomes considerably smaller than the previous size of the transcriptome in earlier versions of salmon (<= 0.15.0). However, depending on the organism, indexing the entire genome as decoy, even though it yields the best accuracy, does require a bit more memory, as specified in the release notes for the 0.99 betas and 1.0.0. 3) Yes; it is still possible to use `salmon index` without any decoy sequence. In this case, one can expect results similar to if you had aligned to the target transcriptome using Bowtie2. In this case, you perform indexing by simply not providing any `--decoy` flag to the `index` command. In that case, all of the records in the target fasta will be treated as valid and quantifiable targets. Of course, for reasons detailed in the pre-print --- the high _sensitivity_ of both Bowtie2 and selective-alignment --- we recommend including either mashmap-derived decoys or the organism's genome as a decoy whenever possible. . 4) Related to @k3yavi's response and my elaboration above: we have dropped quasi-mapping from 1.0.0 (though something akin to it may return in the future if there is sufficient demand and if the shortcomings described in the manuscript can be overcome). However, as I mention in part 3 above, this doesn't mean it's not possible to use v1.0.0 without an explicit decoy sequence. The `--decoy` flag of the indexing command is optional, not required. We will update this in the documentation making it more explicit. However, as @k3yavi points out, it is true that if you wish to use quasi-mapping and selective-alig",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/442#issuecomment-549195390:1041,perform,perform,1041,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/442#issuecomment-549195390,2,['perform'],['perform']

Performance,"d sequences do not retain the names of the GRanges used to subset them therefore my code could not identify minus strand transcripts and get their reverse complements. Apologies for any confusion!; ---; Thank you very much for the prompt response and for taking the time to validate Salmon's functionality. Indeed, Salmon is not the problem here. After taking a closer look at my transcript fasta, I noticed a problem with it, as you suggested. Long story short, half the premature transcripts had the wrong orientation and complementarity. Long story:. Oddly, the mature sequences were fine even though I used an identical approach to subset premature and mature transcripts from the genome reference!. Briefly my approach relied on three R packages rtracklayer, GenomicRanges, and Biostrings. 1. I used rtracklayer to load a gtf formatted exon annotations acquired from Ensembl. The file is loaded as a GenomicRanges object which essentially describes the locus of each exon (the transcribed strand [+ or -], chromosome, start and end positions relative to the reference strand) and its associated gene and transcript. 2. I used the GRanges object to generate pre-RNA coordinates that span all exons of a transcript. 3. I loaded the reference genome fasta acquired from Ensembl using the Biostrings package. GRanges and Biostrings are tightly integrated, allowing me to subset sequences from a Biostrings object using the GRanges object. **I believe the problem lies here.** It appears that when subsetting the mature exonic sequences from Biostrings using GRanges, the strand field in the GRanges object **was not** utilized. I.e., I needed to get the reverse complement of the extracted sequences for transcripts on the minus strand. I had done that and assumed that this behaviour would be consistent. However, for reasons I have not been able to pinpoint (potentially a bug), the strand information **was accounted for** when I used GRanges to subset the premature sequences. I **did not** need",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/655#issuecomment-826035191:1062,load,loaded,1062,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/655#issuecomment-826035191,2,['load'],['loaded']

Performance,"eduplicated_umis"": 402386555,; ""mean_umis_per_cell"": 2954,; ""mean_genes_per_cell"": 896; }; ```. \* total reads have been corrected by adding 2^32. From my understanding of the numbers, this suggests a PCR duplication rate of either 8.95X (comparing ""used reads"" with ""deduplicated umis"") or 6.16X (comparing ""reads in eqclasses"" with ""deduplicated umis""). I had a go at trying to ""manually"" count (via awk/grep/sort/uniq/etc.) the cell barcodes and UMIs associated with the MT-ND1 gene:. ND1-matching reads with good cell barcode QC (barcodes linkable to expected cell barcodes), and good mapping (>60bp matching): 5292134; Unique cell/UMI pairs (subset from the above data): 1590232; => PCR duplication rate ~= 3.32 reads per unique molecule. So it seems like the duplication rate might be closer to the SevenBridges estimate than the Alevin estimate. The Alevin documentation seems to suggest that cell/transcript/UMI triplets are being used for UMI collapsing (""identify potential PCR/sequencing errors in the UMIs, and performs hybrid de-duplication while accounting for UMI collisions""), so I'm at a loss as to why the difference is this large. I'm not too worried about numbers being different, but the UMI proportion is a concern to me, because sequencing is expensive, and it'd be good to have an idea of whether we need to further improve our library prep (which would certainly be the case for 9X duplication, but less important with 3-5X duplication). Is anyone able to explain how the UMI deduplication is applied in Salmon Alevin, or why it might be different from other analysis platforms?. * Which version of salmon was used? v1.9.0; * How was salmon installed (compiled, downloaded executable, through bioconda)?

Performance,"efore used for quantification by default. Specifically, starting with 0.14, ""dovetail"" alignments [(as described in the Bowtie2 manual)](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-dovetail) are considered discordant. This is the same default behavior imposed by Bowtie2. If you look in the `meta_info.json` file for some of these samples (which is in the `aux_info` subdirectory of the quantification directory for a sample), you can see how many mappings are being discarded by virtue of being dovetail mappings. It is possible to allow such alignments (consider them as concordant) by passing the `--allowDovetail` flag. It is not the case that such alignments are always ""bad"", its simply that one would not expect many fragments to align in such a way, and if these constitute the overwhelming majority of the mappings, one might be suspicious about the underlying data. * Selective alignment actually _aligns_ the reads to the transcriptome. For this purpose, it performs end-to-end alignment. This means that if you suspect that the sample may contain adapters or very low-quality read ends, the reads should be trimmed prior to quantification. It is, therefore, worth checking how the mapping rate changes for some of these samples if the reads are trimmed first. * Selective alignment is more robust than quasi-mapping to the chosen value of `-k`, the minimum match length used when searching for alignments. I noticed that some of the samples contain relatively short reads, so you might see if the mapping rate changes if you adopt a smaller value of `-k` in the index (e.g. we use `23` in the [pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/657874v2.full.pdf)). * You mention that this index doesn't contain any decoy sequence. This of course, should not affect the mapping rate. However, I'd be quite curious to see if you index the reference using the _whole genome_ as decoy (i.e. the SAF method from the pre-print), how many reads are discarded because ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/482#issuecomment-582734798:2690,perform,performs,2690,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/482#issuecomment-582734798,2,['perform'],['performs']
Performance,"elective alignment, we could compare and contrast the two. At that point, there are a few options depending on how deeply you want to dive. You could try to see how STAR and selective alignment are mapping differently to these transcripts. One potential difference is that STAR is _a lot_ more happy to softclip reads, which selective alignment won't do by default (you can test the effect with the `--softclipOverhangs` to allow selective alignment to softclip reads that hang off the transcript end or `--softclip` to allow softclips anywhere). Note that selective alignment may _still_ be a bit more conservative than STAR about softclips simply because of the nature of the scoring function it uses. This might give you a sense if one of these alignment methodologies is more consistent with your expectations in this case. Another option is to consider doing a grouping with `terminus`. This will reduce the set of ""genes"" that you can call as DE, because it will be happy to group together transcripts from different genes. However, it should help considerably in eliminating DE from highly-uncertain point estimates. Finally, you might consider performing DE with swish (cc @mikelove as he might have some input here) rather than DESeq2 (though we've typically been using swish at the transcript level rather than the gene level). Unlike DESeq2, swish will explicitly take into account the inferential uncertainty in the abundance estimates, using the Gibbs samples produced by salmon. This will allow it to avoid spurious DE calls that might otherwise occur when you have highly uncertain transcripts that, by chance, end up being assigned very different abundances in different samples / over different runs. Sorry for the information dump, but I wanted to lay out what might be going on, how to assess it, and what some potential solutions might be.

Could you see if you can perform quantification with this index? Finally, it might be worth checking that nothing strange / unexpected is going on with how libraries are being resolved in the linker path when you are running salmon. Could you share the output of running `ldd salmon`? If none of those point at anything obvious, I might also suggest seeing if it runs as expected inside a Docker container.

Performance,"es. Those jobs are still running (it's only been about 4hrs as of this writing, I'll update my post if/when they complete). Current logs are showing that they quickly consume all the available memory, but have not yet crashed. I've also got versions with 128-512GB of memory requested (by powers of 2) for comparison. Some random notes: both the 31-mer index experienced about twice as many soft page reclaims with the new/faster version and experienced a few hard page faults (the previous version saw none of the latter). The 17-mer version experienced fewer page reclaims than any of the 31-mer indices and far fewer than with the prior version. Again, a few page faults crept in, but relatively few by percentage and likely not contributing any significant amount of time overall. [index-qacct-17mer.log](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/files/4246516/index-qacct-17mer.log); [index-qacct-31mer.log](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/files/4246517/index-qacct-31mer.log). **UPDATE**; The 16GB version finished running. It actually only took a little over 4 hours to run, as well. The troubling thing about this job seems to be that, despite having successfully completed, according to the accounting log it used over 20GB of memory... which should be impossible to do. Our resident experts suspect there's a race condition occurring at the tail end of the job and that all of that extra memory is being allocated before the scheduler can kill it for exceeding the limit. Whatever the case, though, this throws into question some of those numbers that I've been grabbing from the accounting logs --- it's either being misreported, or the memory gobbling is happening so rapidly that it may not, in fact, be being properly recorded. I tested the index anyway. It *appears* to be working just fine. Nothing faulted or crashed when I attempted to quantify some reads against it.

I.e. `-l A` gives slightly more counts.

Performance,"ile. First, I've been using salmon for years and I love all the updates that have come about recently. The new selective alignment mode is an amazing upgrade!. My general question here is how to quantify various truncated isoforms of the same transcript. I'm working in S. cerevisiae and I am not referring to isoform switching via alternative splicing, but various isoforms that are fully contained as a subset of a larger transcript sequence. Imagine a standard gene that gives rise to a 1000 bp transcript. Through alternative promoter usage or post-transcriptional processing, it can give rise a truncated form that is identical to the parent transcript, except only has sequence from bases 400 to 1000. I know this scenario is similar to detecting differential splice forms, and indeed when I see overlapping genes that nonetheless have some unique sequence, salmon does an excellent job at fractionally apportioning the reads. In this particular case, however, it seems that because all mappings to the truncated isoform also give perfect mappings to the longer isoform, even a single few reads mapping uniquely to the longer isoform is enough evidence for the salmon EM algorithm (I assume that's the relevant part?) to give *all* of the reads to the long isoform. To visualize the problem, I'm attaching an image of alignments over a transcript that is only expressed as a portion of the annotated parent transcript. If i encode the short and long forms as separate transcripts in salmon fasta index, all of the reads get assigned to the longer form with the options I've tried. My question then is whether there's a combination of salmon quant options that would optimize apportioning the reads better for this class of transcript, or whether it's simply not going to work given the underlying assumptions in the software?. Thanks a ton for any help,; Jason. ![hmlalpha2_truncated_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10292386/80483743-6c217900-890b-11ea-8469-4883914d8ec0.png)",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/514:1811,optimiz,optimize,1811,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/514,1,['optimiz'],['optimize']

Also, the paper referenced above also describes a new capability present in recent versions of salmon that allow it to index the entire genome (as well as the transcriptome) to have the former act as a decoy. This allows avoiding what might otherwise be spurious mappings that result when one considers only the transcriptome as a source of mapping. There are a number of ways to proceed on this front, but this is a good place to first check for discrepancy (and the paper gives a good overview of the relative tradeoffs and merits of different alignment approaches). * Salmon and RSEM use related but distinct optimization algorithms by default. RSEM uses the EM algorithm, and salmon uses the variational Bayesian EM algorithm. The latter tends to induce more sparse solutions. This is simply because they are optimizing slightly different objectives. It is very difficult to say in general if one is ""better"" than the other in a blanket way, but [there is previous literature to support that the VBEM may be more accurate](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/29/18/2292/239795). However, while RSEM only implements the EM algorithm, salmon actually implements and provides a switch to use either. So, if you want to test the effect of this difference, you can run salmon with the `--useEM` algorithm. This will tell salmon to use the ""classic"" EM algorithm and will eliminate this source of variation. * As with the other question you asked, there may be a _small_ discrepancy depending on when enforcement of a stranded library kicks in under salmon's `A` library type. You can eliminate tha",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/612#issuecomment-758004590:2662,optimiz,optimization,2662,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/612#issuecomment-758004590,2,['optimiz'],['optimization']

Performance,"ing with STAR but not when running with selective alignment. However, salmon will attempt to solve the optimization problem with the alignments it is given, regardless of if those come from STAR or from it's built-in selective alignment. While I would generally expect these to be similar, the alignment algorithms are different; see [e.g. the differences between SA/SAF & STAR here](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02151-8). Nonetheless, it is possible that for a small subset of transcripts, the probabilistic allocations are _so_ ambiguous, that you get large swings in the resulting quantification estimates based on tiny variations in where the optimization starts (which is, itself, stochastic due to the asynchronous nature of salmon's online inference phase). One way we can test this hypothesis is as follows. You can run salmon with `--numGibbsSamples 100` and `-d`. This will tell salmon to perform posterior Gibbs sampling (`--numGibbsSamples 100`) and to dump the range-factorized equivalence classes used for offline quantification (`-d`). The Gibbs sampling files will contain the traces for the transcripts in question over the various iterations of the sampling procedure. Transcripts where there is a tremendous amount of ambiguity will tend to have highly anti-correlated posterior samples, and similarly, if you were to consider the abundance output of these transcripts as a *group*, there would be a large reduction in inferential relative variance. In fact, we [wrote a whole paper on this topic](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/Supplement_1/i102/5870485). Consider this example from that paper:. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/361470/101438021-706d3600-38df-11eb-9ada-a54ea9092d2d.png). The x-axis is samples from the Gibbs chains, and the y-values denote the estimated number of reads assigned to both transcripts in each sample. The green line at the top is what you get if you sum the abundances of ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/600#issuecomment-740363115:1036,perform,perform,1036,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/600#issuecomment-740363115,2,['perform'],['perform']

Performance,"inly does seem very low. To answer your specific questions first:; 1) I'm not sure --- let's try tor find out; 2) I don't think so (if they are part of your index, they should be aligned against); 3) If there are many transcripts / targets you expect to be sequenced but which aren't present in this set, that can affect the mapping rate, but not likely to take it down to 6%. Here are the things I'd investigate --- roughly in order: . 1) In addition to the fraction of reads STAR mapped (which you report above), what fraction of the reads are assigned to features by featureCounts? In some cases, when there is a failure of rRNA depletion of polyA selection, you can end up with an experiment where most of the sequenced RNA comes from rRNA not present in the reference transcriptome. In this case, STAR will be able to align the reads to the genome, but you won't see these reads mapping to annotated features (and you also won't see them showing up in your transcript level quantifications). So, it may be worth to take a look at the count of reads assigned to the feature set of genes by featureCounts. 2) Above, it looks like a considerable number of fragments were discarded due to no alignment reaching the required alignment score (`11,448,458` fragments discarded because of this). Have you tried to adapter / quality trim the data? Does this have any effect on the mapping rate?. 3) If the above don't reveal any clues, I'd be happy to try to take a look at the data if you can share it. I'd be quite surprised if STAR is aligning a lot of reads *to transcriptome features* that are being missed by salmon. Nonetheless, if you pass the proper flags to STAR (including `--quantMode TranscriptomeSAM`), then you can use the SAM/BAM file generated by STAR to perform quantification with salmon (i.e. use STAR's alignments to do _transcript-level_ quantification). I'd be happy to help dig further on any of these, so please feel free to reach out if you find anything interesting.

Performance,"ithm so that specific details of the solution are dependent on the order in which the reads are processed (which is random given that multiple threads parse reads and update estimates asynchronously). However, the more important point here is that the inference estimates returned by Salmon (and, for that matter, every other transcript-level expression tool) are the result of a statistical optimization procedure that cannot guarantee a unique global optimal solution (and, in fact, even if a global optimum could be guaranteed, there may be multiple different optima). Thus, there is uncertainty inherent in the statistical problem being solved. Of course, if one ordered updates in the same way and set up the initial conditions precisely the same, there would be convergence to the same result, but any sense of confidence there is illusory. However, Salmon does provide a way to quantify, statistically, confidence in the result. The `--numBootstraps` option will do bootstrap sampling, or the `--numGibbsSamples` option will perform posterior Gibbs sampling. Both of these techniques will provide samples from the posterior distribution, and the variance of these samples will give you some information about the variance in the results that are due purely to the inherent statistical uncertainty in the problem. In the `scripts` folder there is a python script `ConvertBootstrapsToTSV.py` that will convert either the bootstrap or gibbs samples to a easily readable tsv format. These samples represent the estimated number of reads coming from each transcript when sampling from the posterior. These can be used to empirically estimate that statistical uncertainty in the abundance estimates of the different transcripts. Finally, I'll note that while, for the reasons described above, the output is not purely deterministic. The difference between subsequent runs of salmon (with differences changing depending on the order in which reads are parsed and processed) is typically small (and mu",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/102#issuecomment-259464248:1312,perform,perform,1312,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/102#issuecomment-259464248,1,['perform'],['perform']

Performance,"mon for mapping and quantification, there is a separate background thread that simply consumes reads from file and puts them in memory for quantification, and while e.g. pairing information between files is guaranteed to be preserved, exact read order is not. This can lead to differences in the order in which reads are processed and, as a result, differences in the initialization conditions of the optimization. The ultimate result is that for transcripts that have large inferential uncertainty, different numbers of reads can be assigned between runs. We have thought *a lot* about this behavior, what it means, and how the `NumRead` values should best be communicated to users. At the end of the day, the `NumReads` constitute the expected value of latent variables inferred in a _very_ high-dimensional space (# of parameters is at least the number of transcripts). Therefore, there are certain transcripts, whose estimated number of reads simply have _tremendous_ inferential uncertainty — and small perturbations in the initial conditions of the optimization will lead to different estimated values for their abundances. For those transcripts where you observe such fluctuations between runs, this is simply evidence that the precision that can be confidently placed on those estimates is below the degree of variation you observe. Treating these transcripts in downstream analysis as more certain can easily lead to spurious inferences regarding things like differential transcript expression or usage. . One can make an argument for trying to provide a way to enforce removal of this variation (which, granted, would be a challenge).

Performance,"mp3,. Thanks for raising this issue. So, I _am_ surprised at these particular differences that you found, but the behavior you are observing is consistent with how automatic library type detection works. Let me explain what it's doing, and then I'm open to discussing if we should focus on changing that behavior going forward. The standard library type detection works by looking at the total number of compatible mappings in both possible orientations for the first x=10,000 aligned reads. These 10,000 reads are themselves mapped with an `IU` orientation in paired data and a `U` orientation in unpaired data. Once the 10,000 data points have been processed, a heuristic chooses the most likely library type and applies it (and salmon issues a warning if, at the end of quantification,, there are too many reads that disagree). So, the explanation of what could be happening here is that the reads that are different between your runs are coming within the first set of 10,000 aligned reads (note, this may not be the first 10k reads of the file, because concurrent processing means that reads from different threads are being aligned in an essentially random order ... but of course maintaining pairing information). The argument for why this should usually not cause a considerable difference is because (1) the reads are assumed to arrive in a random order (2) this is only a very small fraction of the total data and (3) if the unoriented reads map to a target in the ""wrong"" direction, they will also align to the proper target in the ""right"" direction and, once the orientation filter is applied for future reads, the weight of evidence should turn the probability of assignment of these unoriented reads toward the proper target. However, I'm guessing there is an edge case you're seeing here where the conditions don't induce this behavior. So, there are 2 immediate solutions to the problem. First, if you know the library type explicitly, you can use that. Second (and some other folks h",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/489#issuecomment-738830213:1076,concurren,concurrent,1076,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/489#issuecomment-738830213,1,['concurren'],['concurrent']

Performance,"ne is split into two version by exon skipping and is not alternatively spliced. I also want to make this process fast as the idea would be to look for differences in the proportions of gene versions that are created based on a large databases of RNAseq data (easily 200+ different RNAseq experiments). So to make it quick I am only passing two transcripts to Salmon (T - 1, and T - 2) for version 1 and 2 of the transcript, where version 2 has the 2nd exon (of 4 total exons) removed. . Now I know Salmon was created to map reads to a large number of transcripts across the whole genome, but I believe it still should be possible to narrow down the view to only 1 gene with 2 versions. I believe I just need to set the parameters right, but I also want to set the parameters in a general way so that my script can work across different species with different input RNAseq data. The other problem is that we currently do not have an idea of what proportion of these two versions of the gene should actually exist in the RNAseq data I have (which we didn't perform but just grabbed a random sample from GenBank to test with). My adviser wants to first try and test it computationally first and then verify it in the lab (which is somewhat backwards in my mind, as it's really just a shot in the dark and from my preliminary analysis of Salmon, different parameters can drastically change the proportions of the two versions). . As you can see below, I have tried some parameter settings that I thought would be helpful (particularly ```--quasiCoverage```). But again I could be wrong and would like to know your opinions in the matter. . These runs were all performed with this 'default' run: ; ```; salmon quant -i index -l A -1 reads_1.fq -2 reads_2.fq --validateMappings -p 20 --numPreAuxModelSamples 250 --numAuxModelSamples 1000 -o output ; ```; I changes the ```AuxModelSamples``` to low values as I was generally only mapping 6000 reads to the two transcripts in total, so I didn't think they we",MatchSource.ISSUE,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/401:1712,perform,perform,1712,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/401,1,['perform'],['perform']

Performance,"ng of these considerations. It’s good to think about how data processing choices may affect your results and you are being thoughtful here. I wouldn’t say that, generally, alignment-free tools are more accurate than alignment-based ones. For example, you might look at our recent paper on how [alignment and mapping methodology can influence abundance estimation even when holding the quantification approach fixed](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02151-8), or [this paper on the corner cases of alignment-free methodology](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-018-4869-5) (note the second paper pre-dates the first, and the new selective-alignment methodology in salmon should largely address the issues raised in that paper). However, the bigger and more meaningful distinction is between methods that attempt to properly quantify abundance (generally using a generative statistical model) — including methods like RSEM, BitSeq, salmon, etc., and those that try to simply count aligned reads — including methods like HTSeq and featureCounts. Generally, the former type of methods are more accurate than the latter at both the gene level and the former can also offer transcript-level estimates if desired (counting based methods generally cannot). Finally, to your question more directly, I don’t believe that model misspecification that may result due to not knowing the fragment length distribution will generally have enough of a deleterious effect on the probabilistic quantification methods to degrade their performance to the level of counting based methods. I would still argue to prefer probabilistic quantification (i.e. salmon) to read counting, even if you don’t know the fragment length distribution. As I mentioned above, it may change the maximum likelihood estimates a bit, but should do so across all samples, hopefully minimizing the downstream effects on differential analysis. Good luck with your analysis!.

Performance,"nt algorithms like Bowtie2 and BWA-MEM with respect to both sensitivity and specificity. Here, you are likely seeing a manifestation of the former. Specifically, greedy behavior can lead to spurious matches. Many of these spurious matches are filtered out when applying a consensus mechanism to the series of matches produced by a read; however, this can result in the read going unmapped. We have noticed this behavior where spurious matches can ""mask"" better overall mappings, and we have developed an algorithm to overcome these limitations (called selective-alignment). This is currently implemented in [this branch](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/tree/rescue-orphan) of the Salmon repo (if you want to test it out and have trouble building, we can build you a linux executable). This algorithm explores more potential mappings and then applies a fast algorithm for filtering potentially poor ones. In our benchmarks, it exhibits sensitivity and specificity very close to Bowtie2 (which is among the best of the alignment-based methods we considered). Also, I will note that, though the speed and statistical optimization procedures used in fast transcript abundance estimation tools make them a potentially desirable choice for microbiomic / metagenomic abundance estimation, their indices are typically optimized for speed and not size. For small numbers of bacterial species this can be okay, but if one wishes to index large collections of species, the memory usage can become a problem. To this end, we have developed a new indexing scheme (software [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish), slightly out-of-date pre-print [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/21/191874)). That code already implements a tool for taxonomic read assignment (a la the excellent [Kraken](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken)), but not yet abundance estimation (that is coming soon). So, depending on how much you want to scale up, you might want to keep an eye on that as well.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/196#issuecomment-365337297:1447,optimiz,optimization,1447,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/196#issuecomment-365337297,2,['optimiz'],"['optimization', 'optimized']"

Performance,"ob-p ,. Edit: I have resolved the problem. It is not a problem with Biostrings or GRanges. It turns out that when subsetting the premature sequences, the subsetted sequences do not retain the names of the GRanges used to subset them therefore my code could not identify minus strand transcripts and get their reverse complements. Apologies for any confusion!; ---; Thank you very much for the prompt response and for taking the time to validate Salmon's functionality. Indeed, Salmon is not the problem here. After taking a closer look at my transcript fasta, I noticed a problem with it, as you suggested. Long story short, half the premature transcripts had the wrong orientation and complementarity. Long story:. Oddly, the mature sequences were fine even though I used an identical approach to subset premature and mature transcripts from the genome reference!. Briefly my approach relied on three R packages rtracklayer, GenomicRanges, and Biostrings. 1. I used rtracklayer to load a gtf formatted exon annotations acquired from Ensembl. The file is loaded as a GenomicRanges object which essentially describes the locus of each exon (the transcribed strand [+ or -], chromosome, start and end positions relative to the reference strand) and its associated gene and transcript. 2. I used the GRanges object to generate pre-RNA coordinates that span all exons of a transcript. 3. I loaded the reference genome fasta acquired from Ensembl using the Biostrings package. GRanges and Biostrings are tightly integrated, allowing me to subset sequences from a Biostrings object using the GRanges object. **I believe the problem lies here.** It appears that when subsetting the mature exonic sequences from Biostrings using GRanges, the strand field in the GRanges object **was not** utilized. I.e., I needed to get the reverse complement of the extracted sequences for transcripts on the minus strand. I had done that and assumed that this behaviour would be consistent. However, for reasons I have not ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,COMBINE-lab,salmon,v1.10.1,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/655#issuecomment-826035191:989,load,load,989,https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon,https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/655#issuecomment-826035191,2,['load'],['load']

Performance,"on creates the appropriate offset for you to perform gene-level differential expression; - The second method is to use the tximport argument countsFromAbundance=""lengthScaledTPM"" or ""scaledTPM"", and then to use the gene-level count matrix txi$counts directly as you would a regular count matrix with these software. Let’s call this method “bias corrected counts without an offset”. Now, if I were to use the 2nd bullet as guide, shouldn't txi be generated this way for use with DESeq -- see the addition of `countsFromAbundance = ""lengthScaledTPM""` to tximport line. ```; files <- file.path(dir, ""salmon"", samples$run, ""quant.sf.gz""); names(files) <- paste0(""sample"", 1:6); txi.salmon <- tximport(files, type = ""salmon"", tx2gene = tx2gene, countsFromAbundance = ""lengthScaledTPM""); head(txi.salmon$counts); write.csv(as.data.frame(txi.salmon$counts), file = ""tx2gene_NumReads.csv""); ```. And then use the tx2gene_NumReads.csv with DESeqDataSetFromMatrix, where the countData comes after reading in tx2gene_NumReads.csv upstream in the code. **Note**: I am using DESeqDataSetFromMatrix here and not DESeqDataSetFromTximport as I have used tximport with countsFromAbundance=lengthScaledTPM. ```; library(""DESeq2""); dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = cts,; colData = coldata,; design = ~ condition); dds; ```. I also saw these 2 links - https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop_salmon/lessons/07_DGE_summarizing_workflow.html and https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop_salmon/lessons/01_DGE_setup_and_overview.html. - pseudocounts generated by Salmon are represented as normalized TPM (transcripts per million) counts and map to transcripts. These need to be converted into non-normalized count estimates for performing DESeq2 analysis. To use DESeq2 we also need to collapse our abundance estimates from the transcript level to the gene-level.; - note - the 1st link uses DESeqDataSetFromTximport after using tximport to get txi with countsFromAbundance=lengthScaledTPM.
