Open Babel 1.99#; Released on 2002-1-29.; The Open Babel team is pleased to announce the release of Open Babel 1.99, a first beta release for the 2.0 version of the free, open-source replacement for the Babel chemistry file translation program.; At the moment, the beta release is not a drop-in replacement for babel as some file formats are not implemented and bond orders are not calculated for QM file formats.; Open Babel includes two components, a command-line utility and a C++ library. The command-line utility is intended to be used as a replacement for the original babel program, to translate between various chemical file formats. The C++ library includes all of the file-translation code as well as a wide variety of utilities to foster development of other open source chemistry software. previous; Open Babel 1.100.0. next; API. ; ; ; Edit on GitHub; ; ; . ; © Copyright ©2023 The Open Babel Team.; .

It fixes some long-standing issues affecting performance in terms of chemical accuracy and speed, and all users are recommended to upgrade. It also removes deprecated components and breaks the API in a few places. For information on migrating from the previous version, please see Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x. Notable changes#. The babel program has been removed, and the replacement obabel should be used instead. The obabel program fixes some flaws with the original babel (not least that the user could accidentally overwrite an input file) and so has been preferred for many years.; The Python bindings are now accessed via “from openbabel import pybel” or “from openbabel import openbabel”.; Under the hood, the code for handling ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/ReleaseNotes/ob300.html,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/ReleaseNotes/ob300.html

User Guide; Release Notes; Open Babel 3.0.0. Open Babel 3.0.0#; Released on 2019-10-10.; This is a major release. It fixes some long-standing issues affecting performance in terms of chemical accuracy and speed, and all users are recommended to upgrade. It also removes deprecated components and breaks the API in a few places. For information on migrating from the previous version, please see Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x. Notable changes#. The babel program has been removed, and the replacement obabel should be used instead. The obabel program fixes some flaws with the original babel (not least that the user could accidentally overwrite an input file) and so has been preferred for many years.; The Python bindings are now accessed via “from openbabel import pybel” or “from openbabel import openbabel”.; Under the hood, the code for handling ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/ReleaseNotes/ob300.html,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/ReleaseNotes/ob300.html

It fixes some long-standing issues affecting performance in terms of chemical accuracy and speed, and all users are recommended to upgrade. It also removes deprecated components and breaks the API in a few places. For information on migrating from the previous version, please see Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x. Notable changes#. The babel program has been removed, and the replacement obabel should be used instead. The obabel program fixes some flaws with the original babel (not least that the user could accidentally overwrite an input file) and so has been preferred for many years.; The Python bindings are now accessed via “from openbabel import pybel” or “from openbabel import openbabel”.; Under the hood, the code for handling ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/ReleaseNotes/ob300.html,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/ReleaseNotes/ob300.html

It fixes some long-standing issues affecting performance in terms of chemical accuracy and speed, and all users are recommended to upgrade. It also removes deprecated components and breaks the API in a few places. For information on migrating from the previous version, please see Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x. Notable changes#. The babel program has been removed, and the replacement obabel should be used instead. The obabel program fixes some flaws with the original babel (not least that the user could accidentally overwrite an input file) and so has been preferred for many years.; The Python bindings are now accessed via “from openbabel import pybel” or “from openbabel import openbabel”.; Under the hood, the code for handling implicit hydrogens and kekulization has been entirely replaced in order to address problems with the original approach that had resulted in multiple bug reports over the years. As well as being accurate, the new approach is much faster.; The speed of reading and writing SMILES has been improved by more than 50-fold.; A faste",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/ReleaseNotes/ob300.html,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/ReleaseNotes/ob300.html

User Guide; Release Notes; Open Babel 3.0.0. Open Babel 3.0.0#; Released on 2019-10-10.; This is a major release. It fixes some long-standing issues affecting performance in terms of chemical accuracy and speed, and all users are recommended to upgrade. It also removes deprecated components and breaks the API in a few places. For information on migrating from the previous version, please see Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x. Notable changes#. The babel program has been removed, and the replacement obabel should be used instead. The obabel program fixes some flaws with the original babel (not least that the user could accidentally overwrite an input file) and so has been preferred for many years.; The Python bindings are now accessed via “from openbabel import pybel” or “from openbabel import openbabel”.; Under the hood, the code for handling implicit hydrogens and kekulization has been entirely replaced in order to address problems with the original approach that had resulted in multiple bug reports over the years. As well as being accurate, the new approach is much faster.; The speed of reading and writing SMILES has been improved by more than 50-fold.; A faster and more accurate fragment-based 3D coordinate generation code has been added, part of Google Summer of Code 2018 and 2019, detailed in *J.

As just described, the flow of information is from the 3D coordinates to Open Babel’s internal record of stereo centers, and this flow is triggered by calling stereo perception (which does nothing if the stereo is marked as already perceived). It follows from this that altering the coordinates after stereo perception (e.g. by reflecting through an axis, thereby inverting chirality) has no affect on the internal stereo data. If operations are performed on the molecule that require stereo is be reperceived, then OBMol::SetChiralityPerceived(false) should be called.; It should also be clear from the discussion above that changing the stereo data (e.g. using SetConfig() to invert a tetrahedral stereocenter) has no affect on the molecule’s coordinates (though it may affect downstream processing, such as the information written to a SMILES string). If this is needed, the user will have to manipulate the coordinates themselves, or generate coordinates for the whole molecule using the associated library functions (e.g. the --gen3d operation).; 2D structures; 2D structures represent a depiction of a molecule, where stereochemistry is usually indicated by wedge or hash bonds. It is sometimes indicated by adopting particular conventions (e.g. the Fischer or Haworth projection of monosaccharides). It should be noted that Open Babel does not support any of these conventions, nor does it support the use of wedge or hash bonds for perspective drawing (e.g. where a thick bond is supported by two wedges). This may change in future, of course, but it’s worth noting that Open Babel is not the only toolkit with these limitations and so what you think you are storing in your database may not be what the ‘computer’ thinks it is.; Stereo centers ar",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html

If this is needed, the user will have to manipulate the coordinates themselves, or generate coordinates for the whole molecule using the associated library functions (e.g. the --gen3d operation).; 2D structures; 2D structures represent a depiction of a molecule, where stereochemistry is usually indicated by wedge or hash bonds. It is sometimes indicated by adopting particular conventions (e.g. the Fischer or Haworth projection of monosaccharides). It should be noted that Open Babel does not support any of these conventions, nor does it support the use of wedge or hash bonds for perspective drawing (e.g. where a thick bond is supported by two wedges). This may change in future, of course, but it’s worth noting that Open Babel is not the only toolkit with these limitations and so what you think you are storing in your database may not be what the ‘computer’ thinks it is.; Stereo centers are identified based on a symmetry analysis, and their configuration inferred either from the geometry (for cis/trans bonds) or from bonds marked as wedge/hash (tetrahedral centers). File format readers record information about which bonds were marked as wedges or hashes and this can be accessed with OBBond:IsWedge/IsHash, where the Begin atom of the bond is considered the origin of the wedge/hash. Similar to the situation with 3D perception, changing a bond from a wedge to a hash (or vice versa) has no affect on the stereo objects once stereo has been perceived, but triggering reperception will regenerate the desired stereo data.; It should also be noted that the file writers regenerate the wedges or hashes from the stereo data at the point of writing; in other words, the particular location of the wedge/hash (or even whether it is present) may change on writing. This was done to ensure that the written structure accurately represents Open Babel’s internal view of the molecule; passing wedges/hashes through unchanged may not represent this (consider the case where a",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html

This was done to ensure that the written structure accurately represents Open Babel’s internal view of the molecule; passing wedges/hashes through unchanged may not represent this (consider the case where a wedge bond is attached to a tetrahedral center which cannot be a stereocenter).; 0D structures; A SMILES string is sometimes referred to as describing a 0.5D structure, as it can describe the relative arrangement of atoms around stereocenters.

For example, for a tetrahedral stereocenter, we store information like “looking from atom 2, atoms 4, 5 and 6 are arranged clockwise around atom 3”. This section describes how a user can work with or manipulate this information. This might be useful to invert a particular center, replace a substituent at a stereocenter, enumerate stereoisomers or determine the number of unspecified stereocenters.; Although Open Babel has data structures to support a variety of forms of stereochemistry, currently little use is made of any stereochemistry other than tetrahedral and cis/trans (and square planar to a certain degree).; We will look first of all at how stereochemistry information is stored, accessed, and modified.

Another way to invert the stereo would be to swap two of the refs, or to set the direction from ‘from’ to ‘towards’. Stereo perception#; Until now we have not mentioned where this stereo information came from; we have read a SMILES string and somehow the resulting molecule has stereo data associated with it.; Stereo perception is the identification of stereo centers from the molecule and its associated data, which may include 3D coordinates, stereobonds and existing stereo data. Passing an OBMol to the global function PerceiveStereo triggers stereo perception, and sets a flag marking stereo as perceived (OBMol::SetChiralityPerceived(true)). If, in the first place, stereo was already marked as perceived then stereo perception is not performed. Any operations that require stereo information should call PerceiveStereo before accessing stereo information.; Behind the scenes, the code for stereo perception is quite different depending on the dimensionality (OBMol::GetDimension()) of the molecule.; 3D structures; Perhaps the most straightforward is when the structure has 3D coordinates. In this case, a symmetry analysis identifies stereogenic centers whose stereoconfigurations are then perceived from the coordinates. Some file formats such as the MOL file allow atoms and double bonds to be marked as have unspecified stereochemistry, and this information is applied to the detected stereocenters. For the specific case of the MOL file, the flag in the atom block that marks this is ignored by default (as required by the specification) but an option (s) is provided to read it:; $ obabel -:""I/C=C/C[C@@](Br)(Cl)F"" --gen3d -omol | obabel -imol -osmi; I/C=C/C[C@@](Br)(Cl)F; $ obabel -:""IC=CCC(Br)(Cl)F"" --gen3d -omol | obabel -imol -osmi; IC=CC[C@@](Br)(Cl)F; $ obabel -:""IC=CCC(Br)(Cl)F"" --gen3d -omol | obabel -imol -as -osmi; IC=CCC(Br)(Cl)F.

If this is needed, the user will have to manipulate the coordinates themselves, or generate coordinates for the whole molecule using the associated library functions (e.g. the --gen3d operation).; 2D structures; 2D structures represent a depiction of a molecule, where stereochemistry is usually indicated by wedge or hash bonds. It is sometimes indicated by adopting particular conventions (e.g. the Fischer or Haworth projection of monosaccharides). It should be noted that Open Babel does not support any of these conventions, nor does it support the use of wedge or hash bonds for perspective drawing (e.g. where a thick bond is supported by two wedges). This may change in future, of course, but it’s worth noting that Open Babel is not the only toolkit with these limitations and so what you think you are storing in your database may not be what the ‘computer’ thinks it is.; Stereo centers are identified based on a symmetry analysis, and their configuration inferred either from the geometry (for cis/trans bonds) or from bonds marked as wedge/hash (tetrahedral centers). File format readers record information about which bonds were marked as wedges or hashes and this can be accessed with OBBond:IsWedge/IsHash, where the Begin atom of the bond is considered the origin of the wedge/hash. Similar to the situation with 3D perception, changing a bond from a wedge to a hash (or vice versa) has no affect on the stereo objects once stereo has been perceived, but triggering reperception will regenerate the desired stereo data.; It should also be noted that the file writers regenerate the wedges or hashes from the stereo data at the point of writing; in other words, the particular location of the wedge/hash (or even whether it is present) may change on writing. This was done to ensure that the written structure accurately represents Open Babel’s internal view of the molecule; passing wedges/hashes through unchanged may not represent this (consider the case where a",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html

This was done to ensure that the written structure accurately represents Open Babel’s internal view of the molecule; passing wedges/hashes through unchanged may not represent this (consider the case where a wedge bond is attached to a tetrahedral center which cannot be a stereocenter).; 0D structures; A SMILES string is sometimes referred to as describing a 0.5D structure, as it can describe the relative arrangement of atoms around stereocenters. The SMILES reader simply reads and records this information as stereo data, and then the molecule is marked as having stereo perceived (unless the S option is passed - see below).; Being able to skip the symmetry analysis associated with stereo perception means that SMILES strings can be read quickly - a useful feature if dealing with millions of molecules.

Triggering stereo perception on such a structure will generate stereo data if stereogenic centers are present, but their configuration will be marked as unspecified.

As a result, it is straightforward to keep a copy of the stereo configuration, modify the molecule, and then check whether the modification has altered the stereochemistry using the equality operator of the Config. Modifying the stereochemistry#; We discuss below the interaction between 2D and 3D structural information and how stereochemistry is perceived.

However, where existing stereo data is present (e.g. after reading a SMILES string), that data will be retained if the stereocenter is identified by the perception routine as a true stereocenter.

Atom and Bond Ids; All of the stereo handling code uses Ids to reference atoms and bonds, rather than indices. An Open Babel atom has an index (OBAtom::GetIdx()) and an Id (OBAtom::GetId()). The former runs from 1 to the number of atoms. The latter can be anything (don’t assume it’s the Idx-1), but is unique within the molecule. If you delete an atom, the indices change, but the Ids do not. For this reason, all stereo is stored using Ids so that stereo information is not invalidated by changes to the molecule. When the stereochemistry description involves implicit hydrogens or lone pairs, the special atom Id OBStereo::ImplicitRef (numerically, -2 or 4294967294 if accessed via the bindings) is used.

As just described, the flow of information is from the 3D coordinates to Open Babel’s internal record of stereo centers, and this flow is triggered by calling stereo perception (which does nothing if the stereo is marked as already perceived). It follows from this that altering the coordinates after stereo perception (e.g. by reflecting through an axis, thereby inverting chirality) has no affect on the internal stereo data. If operations are performed on the molecule that require stereo is be reperceived, then OBMol::SetChiralityPerceived(false) should be called.; It should also be clear from the discussion above that changing the stereo data (e.g. using SetConfig() to invert a tetrahedral stereocenter) has no affect on the molecule’s coordinates (though it may affect downstream processing, such as the information written to a SMILES string). If this is needed, the user will have to manipulate the coordinates themselves, or generate coordinates for the whole molecule using the associated library functions (e.g. the --gen3d operation).; 2D structures; 2D structures represent a depiction of a molecule, where stereochemistry is usually indicated by wedge or hash bonds. It is sometimes indicated by adopting particular conventions (e.g. the Fischer or Haworth projection of monosaccharides). It should be noted that Open Babel does not support any of these conventions, nor does it support the use of wedge or hash bonds for perspective drawing (e.g. where a thick bond is supported by two wedges). This may change in future, of course, but it’s worth noting that Open Babel is not the only toolki",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html

This was done to ensure that the written structure accurately represents Open Babel’s internal view of the molecule; passing wedges/hashes through unchanged may not represent this (consider the case where a wedge bond is attached to a tetrahedral center which cannot be a stereocenter).; 0D structures; A SMILES string is sometimes referred to as describing a 0.5D structure, as it can describe the relative arrangement of atoms around stereocenters. The SMILES reader simply reads and records this information as stereo data, and then the molecule is marked as having stereo perceived (unless the S option is passed - see below).; Being able to skip the symmetry analysis associated with stereo perception means that SMILES strings can be read quickly - a useful feature if dealing with millions of molecules. However, if you wish to identify additional stereocenters whose stereo configuration is unspecified, or if the SMILES strings come from an untrusted source and stereo may have been incorrectly specified (e.g. on a tetrahedral center with two groups the same), then you may wish to trigger perception.; Without any additional information, stereo cannot be perceived from a structure that has neither 2D nor 3D coordinates. Triggering stereo perception on such a structure will generate stereo data if stereogenic centers are present, but their configuration will be marked as unspecified. However, where existing stereo data is present (e.g. after reading a SMILES string), that data will be retained if the stereocenter is identi",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html

Let’s call this example.cs.; Copy OBDotNet.dll from the Open Babel installation into the same folder as example.cs.; Open a command prompt at the location of example.cs and compile it as follows:; C:\Work> C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\csc.exe; /reference:OBDotNet.dll /platform:x86 example.cs. Run the created executable, example.exe, to discover the molecule weight of propane:; C:\Work> example.exe; 44.09562. If you prefer to use the MSVC# GUI, note that the Express edition does not have the option to choose x86 as a target. This will be a problem if you are using a 64-bit operating system. There’s some information at Coffee Driven Development on how to get around this.

http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html:7517,Energy Efficiency,adapt,adapting,7517,"approach was that the user never needed to consider the implicit hydrogens; their count was calculated based on the explicit atoms (a behavior known as “floating valence”). The disadvantage was that it was difficult for the user to specify non-standard valencies, may have papered-over problems with the data, gave rise to subtle bugs which were not easily addressed and had poorer performance.; As an example of how the behavior has changed, let’s look at creating a bond. If we read the SMILES string C.C, create a bond between the two atoms and write out the SMILES string, we get different answers for OB 2.x (CC) versus OB 3.0 ([CH4][CH4]). OB 2.x just works out the count based on standard valence rules. With OB 3.0, there were four implicit hydrogens on each carbon before we made the bond, and there still are four - they didn’t go anywhere and weren’t automatically adjusted.; While this may seem like a major change, adapting code to handle the change should be straightforward: adding or removing a bond should be accompanied by incrementing or decrementing the implicit hydrogen count by the bond order. This also applies to deleting an atom, since this deletes any bonds connected to it. Note that care should be taken not to set the hydrogen count to a negative value when decrementing.; unsigned int bondorder = 1;; mol->AddBond(1, 2, bondorder);; OBAtom* start = mol->GetAtom(1);; unsigned int hcount = start->GetImplicitHCount();; start->SetImplicitHCount(bondorder >= hcount ? 0 : hcount - bondorder);; OBAtom* end = mol->GetAtom(2);; hcount = end->GetImplicitHCount();; end->SetImplicitHCount(bondorder >= hcount ? 0 : hcount - bondorder);. For the particular case of creating a new atom, it is worth noting that the implicit hydrogen count defaults to zero and that users must set it themselves if necessary. To help with this situation a convenience function has been added to OBAtom that sets the implicit hydrogen count to be consistent with normal valence rules.

The disadvantage was that it was difficult for the user to specify non-standard valencies, may have papered-over problems with the data, gave rise to subtle bugs which were not easily addressed and had poorer performance.; As an example of how the behavior has changed, let’s look at creating a bond. If we read the SMILES string C.C, create a bond between the two atoms and write out the SMILES string, we get different answers for OB 2.x (CC) versus OB 3.0 ([CH4][CH4]). OB 2.x just works out the count based on standard valence rules. With OB 3.0, there were four implicit hydrogens on each carbon before we made the bond, and there still are four - they didn’t go anywhere and weren’t automatically adjusted.; While this may seem like a major change, adapting code to handle the change should be straightforward: adding or removing a bond should be accompanied by incrementing or decrementing the implicit hydrogen count by the bond order. This also applies to deleting an atom, since this deletes any bonds connected to it. Note that care should be taken not to set the hydrogen count to a negative value when decrementing.; unsigned int bondorder = 1;; mol->AddBond(1, 2, bondorder);; OBAtom* start = mol->GetAtom(1);; unsigned int hcount = start->GetImplicitHCount();; start->SetImplicitHCount(bondorder >= hcount ? 0 : hcount - bondorder);; OBAtom* end = mol->GetAtom(2);; hcount = end->GetImplicitHCount();; end->SetImplicitHCount(bondorder >= hcount ? 0 : hcount - bondorder);. For the particular case of creating a new atom, it is worth noting that the implicit hydrogen count defaults to zero and that users must set it themselves if necessary. To help with this situation a convenience function has been added to OBAtom that sets the implicit hydrogen count to be consistent with normal valence rules.

Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x#; Open Babel 3.0 breaks the API in a number of cases, and introduces some new behavior behind-the-scenes. These changes were necessary to fix some long standing issues impacting chemical accuracy as well as performance.; Here we describe the main changes, and how to change existing code to adapt. Removal of babel#; The babel executable has been removed, and obabel should be used instead.

Specifically, the differences are as follows:. obabel requires that the output file be specified with a -O option. This is closer to the normal Unix convention for commandline programs, and prevents users accidentally overwriting the input file.; obabel is more flexible when the user needs to specify parameter values on options. For instance, the --unique option can be used with or without a parameter (specifying the criteria used).

OBBitVec::IsEmpty() should be used instead.; OBBitVec::BitIsOn() removed. OBBitVec::BitIsSet() should be used instead. Handling of implicit hydrogens#; With OB 3.0, the number of implicit hydrogens is stored as a property of the atom. This value can be interrogated and set independently of any other property of the atom. This is how other mature cheminformatics toolkits handle implicit hydrogens. In contrast, in OB 2.x this was a derived property worked out from valence rules and some additional flags set on an atom to indicate non-standard valency.; From the point of view of the user, the advantage of the 2.x approach was that the user never needed to consider the implicit hydrogens; their count was calculated based on the explicit atoms (a behavior known as “floating valence”).

This also applies to deleting an atom, since this deletes any bonds connected to it. Note that care should be taken not to set the hydrogen count to a negative value when decrementing.; unsigned int bondorder = 1;; mol->AddBond(1, 2, bondorder);; OBAtom* start = mol->GetAtom(1);; unsigned int hcount = start->GetImplicitHCount();; start->SetImplicitHCount(bondorder >= hcount ? 0 : hcount - bondorder);; OBAtom* end = mol->GetAtom(2);; hcount = end->GetImplicitHCount();; end->SetImplicitHCount(bondorder >= hcount ? 0 : hcount - bondorder);. For the particular case of creating a new atom, it is worth noting that the implicit hydrogen count defaults to zero and that users must set it themselves if necessary. To help with this situation a convenience function has been added to OBAtom that sets the implicit hydrogen count to be consistent with normal valence rules. TODO; Regarding specific API functions, the following have been removed:. OBAtom::SetImplicitValence(), GetImplicitValence(); OBAtom::IncrementImplicitValence(), DecrementImplicitValence(); OBAtom::ForceNoH(), HasNoHForce(), ForceImplH(), HasImplHForced(); OBAtom::ImplicitHydrogenCount().

User Guide. Python; The openbabel module. The openbabel module#; The openbabel module provides direct access to the C++ Open; Babel library from Python. This binding is generated using the SWIG; package and provides access to almost all of the Open Babel; interfaces via Python, including the base classes OBMol, OBAtom,; OBBond, and OBResidue, as well as the conversion framework; OBConversion. As such, essentially any call in the C++ API is; available to Python scripts with very little difference in syntax.; As a result, the principal documentation is the; C++ API documentation. Examples#; Here we give some examples of common Python syntax for the; openbabel module and pointers to the appropriate sections of; the API documentation.; The example script below creates atoms and bonds one-by-one using; the; :obapi:`OBMol`, :obapi:`OBAtom`, and :obapi:`OBBond` classes.; from openbabel import openbabel. mol = openbabel.OBMol(); print(mol.NumAtoms()) #Should print 0 (atoms). a = mol.NewAtom(); a.SetAtomicNum(6) # carbon atom; a.SetVector(0.0, 1.0, 2.0) # coordinates. b = mol.NewAtom(); mol.AddBond(1, 2, 1) # atoms indexed from 1; print(mol.NumAtoms()) #Should print 2 (atoms); print(mol.NumBonds()) Should print 1 (bond). mol.Clear();. More commonly, Open Babel can be used to read in molecules using; the :obapi:`OBConversion`; framework.

These iterator classes can be used using the typical Python syntax; for iterators:; for obatom in openbabel.OBMolAtomIter(obmol):; print(obatom.GetAtomicMass()). Note that OBMolTorsionIter returns atom IDs which are off by one.; That is, you need to add one to each ID to get the correct ID.; Also, if you add or remove atoms, you will need to delete the; existing TorsionData before using OBMolTorsionIter. This is done as; follows:; mol.DeleteData(openbabel.TorsionData). Calling a method requiring an array of C doubles#; Some Open Babel toolkit methods, for example :obapi:`OBMol::Rotate() <OpenBabel::OBMol::Rotate>`,; require an array of doubles. It’s not possible to directly use a; list of floats when calling such a function from Python. Instead,; you need to first explicitly create a C array using the; double_array() function:; obMol.Rotate([1.0, -54.7, 3]); # Error!; myarray = openbabel.double_array([1.0, -54.7, 3]); obMol.Rotate(myarray); # Works!. Accessing OBPairData, OBUnitCell and other OBGenericData#; If you want to access any subclass of OBGenericData (such as :obapi:`OBPairData`; or :obapi:`OBUnitCell`); associated with a molecule, you need to ‘cast’ the :obapi:`OBGenericData`; returned by :obapi:`OBMol.GetData() <OpenBabel::OBMol::GetData>` using the toPairData(), toUnitCell() (etc.); functions:; pairdata = [openbabel.toPairData(x) for x in obMol.GetData(); if x.GetDataType()==openbabel.PairData]; print(pairdata[0].GetAttribute(), pairdata[0].GetValue()). unitcell = openbabel.toUnitCell(obMol.GetData(openbabel.UnitCell)); print(unitcell.GetAlpha(), unitcell.GetSpaceGroup()). Using FastSearch from Python#; Rather than use the :obapi:`FastSearch` class directly, it’s easiest to use the :obapi:`OpenInAndOutFiles() <OpenBabel::OBConversion::OpenInAndOutFiles>` method as follows:; >>> from openbabel import openbabel; >>> conv=openbabel.OBConvers",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/UseTheLibrary/PythonDoc.html,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/PythonDoc.html

Examples#; Here we give some examples of common Python syntax for the; openbabel module and pointers to the appropriate sections of; the API documentation.; The example script below creates atoms and bonds one-by-one using; the; :obapi:`OBMol`, :obapi:`OBAtom`, and :obapi:`OBBond` classes.; from openbabel import openbabel. mol = openbabel.OBMol(); print(mol.NumAtoms()) #Should print 0 (atoms). a = mol.NewAtom(); a.SetAtomicNum(6) # carbon atom; a.SetVector(0.0, 1.0, 2.0) # coordinates. b = mol.NewAtom(); mol.AddBond(1, 2, 1) # atoms indexed from 1; print(mol.NumAtoms()) #Should print 2 (atoms); print(mol.NumBonds()) Should print 1 (bond). mol.Clear();. More commonly, Open Babel can be used to read in molecules using; the :obapi:`OBConversion`; framework. The following script reads in molecular information (a; SMI file) from a string, adds hydrogens, and writes out an MDL file; as a string.; from openbabel import openbabel. obConversion = openbabel.OBConversion(); obConversion.SetInAndOutFormats(""smi"", ""mdl""). mol = openbabel.OBMol(); obConversion.ReadString(mol, ""C1=CC=CS1""). print(mol.NumAtoms()) #Should print 5 (atoms). mol.AddHydrogens(); print(mol.NumAtoms()) Should print 9 (atoms) after adding hydrogens. outMDL = obConversion.WriteString(mol). The following script writes out a file using a filename, rather; than reading and writing to a Python string.; from openbabel import openbabel. obConversion = openbabel.OBConversion(); obConversion.SetInAndOutFormats(""pdb"", ""mol2""). mol = openbabel.OBMol(); obConversion.ReadFile(mol, ""1ABC.pdb.gz"") # Open Babel will uncompress automatically. mol.AddHydrogens(). print(mol.NumAtoms()); ",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/UseTheLibrary/PythonDoc.html,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/PythonDoc.html

Pybel is really a wrapper around; openbabel.py, with the result that the OBAtom and OBMol used by; openbabel.py can be interconverted to the Atom and Molecule used by; Pybel.; The following example shows how to read a molecule from a PDB file; using Pybel, and then how to use openbabel.py to add hydrogens. It; also illustrates how to find out information on what methods and; classes are available, while at the interactive Python prompt.; >>> from openbabel import pybel; >>> mol = next(pybel.readfile(""pdb"", ""1PYB"")); >>> help(mol); Help on Molecule in module pybel object:; ...; | Attributes:; | atoms, charge, dim, energy, exactmass, flags, formula,; | mod, molwt, spin, sssr, title.; ...; | The original Open Babel molecule can be accessed using the attribute:; | OBMol; ...; >>> print(len(mol.atoms), mol.molwt); 3430 49315.2; >>> dir(mol.OBMol) # Show the list of methods provided by openbabel.py; ['AddAtom', 'AddBond', 'AddConformer', 'AddHydrogens', 'AddPolarHydrogens', ... ]; >>> mol.OBMol.AddHydrogens(); >>> print(len(mol.atoms), mol.molwt); 7244 49406.0. The next example is an extension of one of the openbabel.py; examples at the top of this page.

The; unitcell attribute gives access to any unit cell data; associated with the molecule (see; :obapi:`OBUnitCell`).; The remaining attributes correspond directly to attributes of; OBMols: e.g. formula is equivalent to; :obapi:`OBMol::GetFormula() <OpenBabel::OBMol::GetFormula>`.

There are two functions for; reading Molecules:. readstring(); reads a Molecule from a string; readfile(); provides an iterator over the Molecules in a file. Here are some examples of their use. Note in particular the use of; next() to access the first (and possibly only) molecule in a; file:; >>> mymol = readstring(""smi"", ""CCCC""); >>> print(mymol.molwt); 58; >>> for mymol in readfile(""sdf"", ""largeSDfile.sdf""); ... print(mymol.molwt); >>> singlemol = next(readfile(""pdb"", ""1CRN.pdb"")).

For files containing multiple molecules, the; Outputfile; class should be used instead. This is initialised with a format and; filename (and optional overwrite parameter). To write a; Molecule to the file, the; write(); method of the Outputfile is called with the Molecule as a; parameter.

How to add a new file format#; Adding support for a new file format is a relatively easy process, particularly with Open Babel 2.3 and later. Here are several important steps to remember when developing a format translator:. Create a file for your format in src/formats/ or src/formats/xml/ (for XML-based formats). Ideally, this file is self-contained although several formats modules are compiled across multiple source code files.; Add the name of the new .cpp file to an appropriate place in src/formats/CMakeLists.txt. It will now be compiled as part of the build process.; Take a look at other file format code, particularly exampleformat.cpp, which contains a heavily-annotated description of writing a new format. XML formats need to take a different approach; see the code in xcmlformat.cpp or pubchemformat.cpp.; When reading in molecules (and thus performing a lot of molecular modifications) call :obapi:`OBMol::BeginModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::BeginModify>` at the beginning and :obapi:`OBMol::EndModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol",MatchSource.WIKI,docs/WritePlugins/AddFileFormat.html,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddFileFormat.html

Adding new operations and options#; The babel command line has the form:; babel inputfile [outputfile] [options]. There are several types of options:. Options that control the conversion processFor example -i, -o and -m. Options specific to particular input or output formatsThese are specified with the -a and -x prefixes. General optionsThese usually operate on a molecule after it has been read by the input format and before it has been written by the output format. The ones of interest here are the general options. These can be single letter options like -c (which centers coordinates), or multi-character options like --separate (which makes separate molecules from disconnected fragments). The ones mentioned are hardwired into the code, but it is possible to define new options that work in a similar way. This is done using the :obapi:`OBOp` class. The OBOp class#; The name :obapi:`OBOp` is intended to imply an operation as well as an option.

User Guide; Adding plugins. Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and Martinez, 2007). To add a new plugin of any type, the general method is very simple:.
