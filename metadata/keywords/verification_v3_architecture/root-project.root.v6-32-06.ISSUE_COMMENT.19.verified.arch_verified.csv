This guarantees that if CMSSW has N output modules, there will be at most N queued merge operations and while the merge are going on only 1 thread is used for it (and the other N-1 can be used for other CMSSW work). e) We need to implement a queuing of the merge operations tasks without relying on the ROOT global write lock. See for example the way something similar is done in CSMSW: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/FWCore/Concurrency/interface/SerialTaskQueue.h. f) CMSSW need to call a 'finalization' API to 'close-out' the output file (without this call the output file is useless).
Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",True,"While this content focuses on specific implementation details within CMSSW (a software framework), it highlights architectural concerns: 

* **Concurrency and Parallelism:** The discussion about merging operations, thread management (`only 1 thread is used for it`), and queuing tasks (`serial task queue`) reveals considerations about how the system handles multiple concurrent requests and processes. This directly relates to architectural decisions about scalability and performance.
* **System Interactions and Dependencies:**  The content mentions the interaction between different CMSSW modules, including output modules, merge operations, and callbacks. This demonstrates an awareness of how components within the system depend on each other, a key aspect of software architecture.
* **Design Trade-offs:** The need to avoid re-reading data from files (`output file is kept open`) and the choice of implementing a queuing mechanism (`without relying on the ROOT global write lock`) suggest deliberate design decisions made to balance different goals (performance, concurrency).  

Overall, while the content delves into implementation specifics, it clearly reflects architectural considerations related to system behavior, interactions, and performance."

",True,"The provided content discusses behavior for different types of objects in ROOT, specifically non-TTree and TTree objects. It mentions how objects are handled when written with the same name, creating namecycles, and how they are retrieved. It also explains that TTree objects can have multiple updates stored as cycles, accessible via specific links. While this information is technical, it relates to how software components interact and manage their states during deployment or operation. The mention of 'behaviour' suggests that the software's behavior in handling these scenarios is being described. This ties into the Deployability attribute as it pertains to how software can be deployed and managed in an operational environment with clear guidance on object handling, which could influence deployment strategies and maintenance efforts.","

Deployability,"Good morning.; As you wish.

Content: Hi @MarkusFrankATcernch ,. I am sorry you experienced this issue.; We know that importing ROOT using LCG releases, perhaps on lxplus nodes can be slow. For this reason, we implemented a first pack of optimisations in PyROOT for the ROOT release 6.30. Unfortunately, this is not available yet in any LCG stack.; Is it easy for you to perform the same measurement with a dev3 lcg stack?

",False,"This conversation focuses on performance optimization issues within a specific software environment (ROOT and LCG) rather than broader architectural concepts.  

Here's why it's not about software architecture:
* **No Architectural Patterns or Styles:** There's no mention of architectural patterns like microservices or monoliths.
* **Limited Discussion on Decisions and Trade-offs:** The focus is on a specific performance bottleneck (slow importing) and a proposed solution (using the latest ROOT optimizations).
* **Implementation Details Predominate:**  The conversation delves into technical details about software releases, environments (lxplus nodes), and specific versions of libraries (ROOT 6.30, ROOT master). 

While performance is an architectural concern, this discussion is too granular and focused on implementation-level solutions to be classified as a discussion of software architecture."

Content: Hi @eguiraud -- as far as I know there are not any pre-compiled binaries yet for Ubuntu 22?. I am trying to build ROOT as part of a project that builds several useful HEP packages together with proper Python bindings for running python scripts. I have not checked in awhile but I remember pre-built ROOT binaries being built only with Python 2, which will not suit our purposes. Even pre-built with Python3, having to install extra Python distributions is a shame, and then extra package managers on top of that can make things pretty messy (and conflicts commonplace). . There are work-arounds of course like installing a VM or different Ubuntu distribution, but I think this just postpones solving the problem...

Content: Hi @rdschaffer,. > And it seems only in October, was it?. Would you know if it may have been tied to your analysis going to a different analysis release?. Analysis release 21.2.139 uses XRootD 4.10.0. (As it happens we switched to XRootD 4.12.2 just with AnalysisBase-21.2.140.) We've used XRootD 4.10.0 (in sync with external versions from [LCG_96b](http://lcginfo.cern.ch/release/96b/)) from 21.2.115 before that. Could you check which version of the analysis release you were using before 21.2.139? I still suspect that the problematic nodes provide a different version of some system library than the non-problematic ones. And that this may not have been an issue with previous versions of the analysis release (previous versions of XRootD...), but with 4.10.0 it is. You could of course also try to switch to a newer version. But I understand that your analysis may very well not want to do that for physics reasons... Cheers,; Attila

Content: Hi @vgvassilev , thanks once again for this great development, which was delivered and tested on such a short timescale, basically during the end of the year break. On January 23rd, the last open pre-release of CMSSW_14_0_0 will close: after that date, no ROOT version updates will be possible (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/43077#issuecomment-1858057605).; Currently, the CMS issue has been worked around, therefore ROOT 6.30 *can* be picked up by CMS. However, it would be much better to have your fix in master and the 6.30 branch for CMS to pick up. That leaves us with a short window of opportunity, which is basically this week. .

Fortunately, you don't necessarily have to compile and set up ROOT yourself to work on this issue :) All you need it a working ROOT installation on your system.

For more information on how to install ROOT also on different platforms, please take a look also at https://root.cern/install/. Once you have ROOT installed, you can download one of the roostats tutorials that you want to translate (maybe pick a shorter one in the beginning, like [rs101_limitexample](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/tutorials/roostats/rs101_limitexample.C). Remember you just need the tutorial file, not the whole ROOT repository. To try out the tutorial, you can run it with the root interpreter by typing `root rs101_limitexample.C` in the command line. You will get a graph as a result. To translate the tutorial, you need to create a `rs101_limitexample.py` file where you exactly recreate the tutorial in pyROOT, such that one can run it with `python rs101_limitexample.py` and get the same graph than with the C++ version.

Content: Hi @yuhao-wang-nju, thanks for your post!. 1. This is by design (see #15153); 2. Where does the doc say that? I think cppyy pythonizes the `cppyy.gbl.std.string` such that it *behaves* like a Python `str`, therefore it can be used in many contexts where one would use ` str`. But this doesn't always help. The type is different after all, and there is no automatic conversion for the reasons outlined in #15153. You will have to do this yourself with `str()` around the `std::string`.; 3. The evaluation was [completely replaced in 6.32](https://root.cern/doc/master/release-notes.html#new-cpu-likelihood-evaluation-backend-by-default). Probably you have one of the corner cases where the new backend is slower and I need to debug this. Is it also possible to reproduce this slow fit with the workspace you shared? Maybe you can share the full script?. Thanks a lot!. Related PR: #14237

Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: Hi Danilo, yes indeed I was running ROOT 6.26.02. I just removed it, but compilation is still failing.; The warning is still shown too. I wonder if this might not be related just to an issue with a specific AppleClang version.. (I have the last one installed) I don't need a specific version of ROOT, but I just some specific modules (not enabled by default.). So, I tried to to install ROOT 6.31, first not working but due to a Net module issue. I removed ROOT 6.26.02 and the compilation is successful. Would you maybe consider adding a warning at the end of the cmake command if an existing ROOT is already loaded ? This might spare some times for other users in the future, maybe ?

Deployability,"Hi Sergey, . The class `TJSON` is indeed similar to the library of _nlohmann_ except a whole lot more lean (_nlohmann_ is 14,748 lines of code, while `TJSON` is 962 lines of code - as per `sloccount`). _nhlohmann_ tries to be very general and in fact expands upon the JSON standard, while `TJSON` tries to be as simple as possible. . Also, for `TJSON` I tried to do a bit of ROOT integration. For example, one can get arrays as `TArrayD` or `TArrayI` if possible, or one can assign from `TParameter<T>`. This is simple to make life a little easier for people. . That said, I have no particular preference for either.

Content: Hi Sergey, . The class `TJSON` is indeed similar to the library of _nlohmann_ except a whole lot more lean (_nlohmann_ is 14,748 lines of code, while `TJSON` is 962 lines of code - as per `sloccount`). _nhlohmann_ tries to be very general and in fact expands upon the JSON standard, while `TJSON` tries to be as simple as possible. . Also, for `TJSON` I tried to do a bit of ROOT integration. For example, one can get arrays as `TArrayD` or `TArrayI` if possible, or one can assign from `TParameter<T>`. This is simple to make life a little easier for people. . That said, I have no particular preference for either. However, you should consider in the build system to use system available installation of _nlohmann_ instead of using built-in copy. You really don't want different versions of the same code floating around on a given machine. . Yours,. Christian

Content: Hi Vassil,. > We cannot control what's in the static init of user libraries. They can; use interpreter services. This approach used to work, why locking is; necessary? Aren't we 'just' reading?. Other threads could be trying to write the symbol tables at the same time,; so we still need to lock them for reading. In your case your lookup enters a generator (HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator),; so it will end up writing as well as reading. :). The right thing to do here is to refactor HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator; to do its work in two steps:; Step 1: Identify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested; symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you; should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ (; ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each; library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using; JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll; walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should; prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing. Unfortunately if you can reference JIT'd code from static initializers in; precompiled code then there's still a chance for similar failures. Consider; a precompiled ""libx.so"" containing a global ""x"" and a static constructor; that calls a JIT'd function ""f"" which uses the ""x"" from ""libx.so"" (a; circular reference).

Content: Hi, I've found this proposal in scope of https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/22616 investigation.; I'd vote for such improvement and can help with it from TBB side. First, I can confirm that TBB 2021 (now it's oneTBB 2021) has CMake build system. Second, oneTBB integration to CMake project may be done in two major ways:; 1. Source integration (`add_subdirectory`) - oneTBB is just built from sources together with user project.; 2. Binary integration (`find_package`) - user project relies on pre-built oneTBB, it is supported through TBBConfig files inside oneTBB packages, for some distributions/versions it will work out-of-the-box, but for others it may require additional CMake variable to be set. [Here ](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/blob/master/cmake/README.md#tbbconfig---integration-of-binary-packages)is a short description of binary integration. The (1) way is supported only starting from oneTBB 2021, while the (2) way was [introduced](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/tree/tbb_2020/cmake#binary-package-integration) in TBB 2017 U7 and slightly changed in oneTBB 2021. What way is preferable? In theory we can think about some kind of mixed approach.

My setup using setupATLAS when compiling the project ; (And tested with the standalone file as well); ```; setupATLAS; asetup AnalysisBase,24.2.27; ```. **Regarding the debug build**; I used the latest corresponding to `x86_64-el9-gcc13-dbg`; ```; source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/dev3/latest/x86_64-el9-gcc13-dbg/setup.sh; ```. However, this gives a ROOT version of ROOT 6.31/01, which is higher than what I compiled for (6.28/08). With this upgraded ROOT version, my project no longer compiles. (And since we don't plan on updating past the AnalysisBase release, I don't plan to fix the compilation error 🙂); If there's a way of obtaining a debug build of ROOT 6.28/08, I can try it. This coredump only started appearing when our compiler version changed from x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt to x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt, and we moved to AnalysisBase,24.2.27 from AnalysisBase,22.2.113. Before this update, we have not seen our program core dump. While I'm curious of the cause, we don't need this fixed. ; Using `std::filesystem` works well for us. 👍

",True,"The content discusses architectural decisions made by the LHCb project regarding code compilation and execution.  Here's why it relates to software architecture: 

* **Compile-time Instruction Set Selection:** The decision to choose different function implementations based on compile flags (`-mavx2`, `-march=haswell`) is an architectural choice that directly impacts the system's behavior and performance. This demonstrates a consideration for target hardware and its impact on software execution.
* **Dependency Management:**  The mention of Conda-based installations in the analysis stage highlights an approach to managing dependencies, which is a crucial aspect of software architecture, particularly in large projects.
* **Trade-offs and Constraints:** The discussion about debugging challenges arising from dynamic dispatching (choosing functions based on runtime conditions) reveals an understanding of architectural trade-offs. They chose a compile-time approach over runtime dispatching to prioritize debuggability, illustrating the consideration of quality attributes.

While the content focuses primarily on code implementation details, the underlying decisions made about compilation and deployment clearly demonstrate architectural considerations."

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Data:

Content: I am still a bit confused. When I download 6.30 binary release, and run tutorials/eve7/boxset.C. it correctly opens a web browser and all looks fine, JSON communication works. But then (in 6.30):. ```; root-config --has-builtin_nlohmannjson; no; ```. How is it possible then that the tutorial is working correctly?. And why, in 6.28, was the behavior:. ```; root-config --has-builtin_nlohmannjson; yes; ```. Maybe @krasznaa has some ideas on the CMake part.
Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The content focuses on debugging a specific code behavior (JSON communication and CMake configuration) within a software release.  It discusses version differences (`6.30` vs. `6.28`) and tool usage (`root-config`), but doesn't delve into architectural patterns, decisions, or system structure. The issue seems tied to implementation details rather than broader architectural concerns."

Data:

Content: I did a very quick test linking a test `example` target to an install of a `foo` project whose targets have the `cxx_auto_type` compile feature in their interface features (so C++11). When linking to these targets, I found:. 1) Just `target_link_libraries(example foo::foo)`, the `-std=c++11` flag is appended to the compilation flags of the `example` sources.; 2) Adding `target_compile_features(example PUBLIC cxx_std_14)` uses `-std=c++14` in the flags.; 3) Setting `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14` instead of using `target_compile_features` has the same effect. The reverse also applies - linking to a C++14 imported target, but requiring C++11 in the project does result in C++14 flags applied to the compilation of the project (so behaviour is ""newest standard wins"").

Content: I don't think we have an explicit test for this patch. We did some archeology. The commit message is rather poor and dates back to 234fd515ed3893629e1e170e5c497688c81281b9. We could only indirectly guess what was trying to do and the best description of the code that was failing and we tried to fix is these 2 failing tests: `clang/test/Modules/module-file-modified.c` and `clang/test/Modules/explicit-build-missing-files.cpp`. Given what fails in these tests and the age of this change I find it highly unlikely that cmssw won't be able to catch such a setup. At that point, I don't think we are much more informed than you and we are hoping that dropping this change is reasonable to move forward.

The right thing to do here is to refactor HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator to do its work in two steps:; Step 1: Identify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet.

Content: I replied via email, but GitHub does not seem to have picked it up, so posting here for good measure:. > We cannot control what's in the static init of user libraries. They can use interpreter services. This approach used to work, why locking is necessary? Aren't we 'just' reading?. Other threads could be trying to write the symbol tables at the same time, so we still need to lock them for reading. In your case your lookup enters a generator (HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator), so it will end up writing as well as reading. :). The right thing to do here is to refactor HostLookupLazyFallbackGenerator to do its work in two steps:; Step 1: Identify libraries that could be loaded to provide the requested symbols, and record their paths but do not load them yet. Instead you should record a map of libraries to the symbols they provide. E.g. [ ( ""liba.so"", [ ""foo"", ""bar"" ] ), ( ""libb.so"", [ ""baz"" ] ) ]. For each library/symbol-set pair you can install a custom MaterializationUnit using JITDylib::define.; Step 2: In the custom MaterializationUnit's materialize function you'll walk the map from before, do the library load, and then resolve the symbols. Since step 2 happens outside the session lock the idea is that it should prevent the kind of deadlock that you're seeing.

Content: If we rely on PYTHONPATH, only one ROOT version and one Python version will work properly. If we use setup.py, then we can have multiple versions of Python with the same version of ROOT. However, I do not know of a way in which you can have multiple versions of ROOT and multiple versions of Python without requiring some sort of virtualenv or a setup script to set PYTHONPATH, which is a no go for me, or requiring users to `import ROOT-6.16` or similar in Python code, which is also a no go. Maybe someone with more knowlegde about installing multiple versions of a given package in Python can give some clues.

We wanted to check this patch if was necessary, however, looking at it we thought that it was maybe not needed even for the current llvm we have as the infrastructure wrt modules/pch has changed significantly since the development of this patch. If we have less patches in our clang fork, it will likely mean faster/smoother llvm upgrades.

The error you see happens because `find_dependency(Vdt)` tries to read a header for Vdt (to figure out its version) which should be in the build directory (builtin_vdt==True), but is not there yet, because the build/install of Vdt as a builtin happens only at build time, not configuration time.

Content: Note from the JIRA tickets:. Summary of discussion related to this ticket and https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9543. In the issue #9543, the unusual situation is the combination of:. * there is (intentionally) no dictionary for `std::map<int,std::vector<int>>`; * consequently we use an ""emulated collection proxy"" for that collection; * there is (unintentional due to external config) interpreter information/ClassInfo for `std::map<int,std::vector<int>>`. The crux of the issue #9543 is:. * TClass::fSizeof info prefers the information from the CollectionProxy; * TStreamerInfo::fSize is set to the value of TClass::fSizeOf; * TClass:New prefers the constructor from the interpreter; * TStreamerInfo::New was using TClass::New for that case; * On the failing platform, the `sizeof(std::map<int,std::vector<int>>)` is larger than the size of the emulated collection. Since the I/O and TStreamerInfo uses the TCollection proxy and all of TStreamerInfo needs to prefer the information from the collection proxy (including the 'sizeof'). To fix #9543 the solution is for; * TStremearInfo::New to prefer/use TCollectionProxy::New over TClass::New (i.e. the interpreted constructor in this particular case). Since we can access the emulated collection through the CollectionProxy, it makes sense to have `TClass` to be a way to access/use the interpreted instance. In order to be consistent (`TClass:New` already prefers the interpreted information), TClass::fSizeOf should be set the sizeof the interpreted instance.

4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The provided content appears to be a series of log lines showing software dependencies and paths, possibly related to deployment processes. It includes references to files like OOTDataFrame.so and various .so libraries located in /cvmfs/ directories, which could indicate the use of specific deployment configurations or automated installation procedures. The mention of wget commands and script execution (like ./runGen-00-00-02) suggests a deployment process that can be rolled back if needed. Additionally, the presence of LD_PRELOAD and ldd main.mars indicates dependency resolution, which is part of deployability in terms of automation and deployment speed. Therefore, this content aligns with the Deployability quality attribute as it discusses deployment-related tasks and processes.","

Quality Attribute: Deployability
Attribute Description: The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed. Key aspects include automation, deployment speed, and deployment granularity.
Content: Ok then we should try to make this an actual backport of that patch. The llvm patch adds the `cmake_policy` command to `llvm/CMakeLists.txt`. Is the corresponding file in our source tree `interpreter/llvm/src/CMakeLists.txt`?

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,The content discusses deployment-related tasks such as updating CMakeLists.txt and patching LLVM. This aligns with deployability as it involves making changes that can be deployed efficiently.,"
You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Content: Ok then we should try to make this an actual backport of that patch. The llvm patch adds the `cmake_policy` command to `llvm/CMakeLists.txt`. Is the corresponding file in our source tree `interpreter/llvm/src/CMakeLists.txt`?
Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.

Deployability,"Ok yes, this is exactly the same underlying issue as ROOT-9487 mentioned above, but for single-thread runs this time, so the workaround mentioned in ROOT-9487 does not work (and indeed adding `ROOT.EnableImplicitMT()` at the top of the repro gets rid of the warnings). The issue: `Snapshot` adds the output tree as a clone of the input chain, because the output tree needs to be informed when the addresses of the input branches change (as it happens when the chain switches from one tree to the next). Now, when performing the address updates, the input chain might complain _once per active branch_ if it does not find a corresponding branch in the output tree. I don't know how to solve this elegantly. The only idea I have is an ad-hoc temporary silencing of these warnings at the point at which an input chain in RDF switches files. @pcanal might have a better proposal.",update,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7727#issuecomment-817874049:536,updates,536,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7727#issuecomment-817874049,1,['update'],['updates'],"The capability of software to be deployed into an operational environment with predictable time and effort, including options for rollback if needed.

",True,"The content discusses an issue related to deployment problems in a software environment, specifically mentioning ROOT-9487 and addressing concerns about deployment warnings. It talks about how snapshot operations cause issues with address updates and how these need to be managed during deployment. This aligns with Deployability as it involves resolving deployment-related issues that affect the ability to deploy software predictably and effectively.","
