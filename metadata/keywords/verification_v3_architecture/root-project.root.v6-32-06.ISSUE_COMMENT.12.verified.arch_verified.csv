Maybe this is also of interest to @vgvassilev, @hahnjo.

As explained in [this PR](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11909/files) and later also dicussed in [this forum post](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/retreiving-the-calculation-strategy-of-a-roonll/55715/2), saving test statistics objects to ROOT files like `RooNLLVar` is now prohibited since ROOT 6.28. It only technically seemed to work without error, but in fact the read-back RooNLLVars are corrupted and give wrong results when you read them back even for simple Gaussian cases, as I showed in the description of the linked PR. This and other reasons lead us to the decision to disallow the IO of `RooNLLVar` and other test statistics classes. From your warnings and error messages, it seems like you're trying to do IO of the RooNLLVar. Is there a way you can avoid this in your workflow? As I said it's not allowed anymore and in older ROOT versions it was not reliable. What people usually do is to save the pdf and the datasets in a RooWorkspace, and maybe a `ModelConfig` to simplify the NLL creation when reading back the data and pdf. Is that not an option for your?. Certainly I was not expecting that the removal of this accidental and buggy IO feature would cause some friction with some users, so I'm happy to help you finding an alternative and better solution!

What is left in this PR is the question about the constrain settings that might not make sense. Let's discuss this in the next RooFit meeting then!. What I ultimately want to achieve is that RooFit prints errors if you have constrained settings that statistically don't make sense, to reduce the potential for user error. That means we can't have ""unphysical"" fits in our tests too, otherwise they would fail eventually from these error messages.

Content: Hi @thomreis ,; thank you for your report. `GetImplicitMTPoolSize` was deprecated in v6.22 and removed in v6.24, see https://root.cern/doc/v622/release-notes.html#deprecation-and-removal . During the removal, it looks like the public declaration of the method was deleted (in 4b49fbd25639367942d699f28d93253190056302 ), but the implementation was forgotten there -- unreachable because there is no corresponding declaration in the header. Thank you for noticing, I opened #10422 to remove the leftover definition. Closing this as clarified (`GetThreadPoolSize` is intentionally the only available such function).

It can be used as; ```; TEnum::GetEnum(""ROOT::Detail::VecOps::TAdoptAllocator<double>::EAllocType""); ```; I don't know if it can be used inside these utils but it would have an advantage wrt to the current solution, namely the ability to avoid lookups in case the enum is present in the type-system (selected by the user). This would avoid memory consumption in case of autoparsing being triggered.; The PR is a nice improvement, I am discussiong a *possible* performance improvement on top of it!

If ROOT wants to be able to use multiple versions of TBB at the same time, it must stop relying on explicit names like `tbb::interface7::task_arena`... Cheers,; Attila

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content discusses minimizing a function and handling invalid Hessian matrices by adding warnings and stopping iterations. This relates to system reliability and recovery as it ensures minimal downtime during issues. It focuses on preventing failures through proper checks, which aligns with the Availability quality attribute.","
You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Content: Hi, . Thank you Hans for your example, it was very useful for this case. . I have investigate this and I think the assert should be removed and there is no need of a warning or an error. The first time one iterates the first states comes from MnSeed and I think in that case the state is always valid (but not 100% sure); Eventually we could add the assert or (better) an Error but not at line 232, but at line 75, when we enter in the top function VariableMetricBuilder::Minimum.

Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
