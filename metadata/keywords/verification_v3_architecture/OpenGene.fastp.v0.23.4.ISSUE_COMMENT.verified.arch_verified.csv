Energy Efficiency,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given.

Integrability,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is. Please feel free to let me know if I didn't make it clear or if it works for you.

Content: Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given. I would suggest to play with Fastp with the sequence of the other strand adapter. Or you can simply extract some reads sequence and analyze it manually, to find where the adapter is and what actual it is. Please feel free to let me know if I didn't make it clear or if it works for you. Thanks!

",True,"The provided content discusses issues related to Fastp and adapter removal based on sequence context.

The problem revolves around technical compatibility between Fastp's adapter recognition and the actual adapter sequences in different reads, potentially causing integration issues if not handled properly.

Modifiability,"Hi, there~I met a similar problem and I figured out an explanation myself which at least works for mine. . The possible reason that Fastp does not recoginze and remove the adapter while FastQC detects is that R1 reads are shorter than 150bp, which means the adapter in R1.fastq.gz detected by FastQC is actually the reversed and complementary adapter of R2. So, in this situation, if you want to remove the adapter in R1 via Fastp, specify the adapter sequence in Fastp command with ""-a reversed_and_complementary_adapter_sequence_of_Read2"". And if you want to remove the adapter in R2, use the sequence of reversed and complementary adapter of R1. When you have a library shorter than 150bp, Sequencer will keep reading bases after finishing your inserts and continue to read the bases according to the adapter of the opposite strand. My guess is that FastQC can detect those widely-used adapters both reversed or not while Fastp can't, which means Fastp can only auto-detect those widely-used adapters literally based on the sequences given.

Data:

Content: I was having the exact same issue and I was able to solve it by setting a `conda` environment with `conda-forge` as the priority channel. These are the steps I followed:. 1. Add `bioconda` and `conda-forge` as the priority channels for the installation of packages. This will allow for the newest version of `fastp` . Run the following commands to add the channels:; ```; conda config --add channels bioconda; conda config --add channels conda-forge; ```. 2. Create a new `conda` environment (I specified `python=3.9`, not sure if it is necessary); ```; conda create -n my_env python=3.9; ```. 3. All packages should be installed from the `conda-forge` channel, but just to make sure activate the environment and run; ```; conda update --all; ```. 4. Install `fastp` and it should give you version `0.23.2` by simply doing; ```; conda install fastp; ```. Hopefully it will also work for you! This solution worked for me on my Mac running macOS Big Sur and on a Linux server.

Content: Hi,; I think global trimming is just removing a fixed number of bases from either end of the reads. And for trimming by quality, both Naive and Phred algorithms use quality scores (http://seqanswers.com/forums/showpost.php?p=144154&postcount=17), but naive takes the quality score as an integer without taking into account the error probability it represents unlike the Phred algorithm.; The reason I mentioned adapter trimming is because it outperforms `bbduk.sh` from `BBTools` in that particular task, however `bbduk.sh` uses the PHRED algorithm to trim by quality which makes it better suited for the trimming. At the end, I am looking forward to simplify my pre-processing of the reads ideally using a single program.; By the way, I really like the format of the reports, is a really good idea.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: To make it more clear:. From your log, fastp found one read that its sequence length and quality length is different, and then exit at once. Could you please check whether your FASTQ file contain such read?.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text.

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
