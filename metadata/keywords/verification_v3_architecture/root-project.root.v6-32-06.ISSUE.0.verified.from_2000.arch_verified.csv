Content: In the jitted version of the `Vary` transformation a node is allocated on the heap and its address is passed down to the function `JitVariationHelper`, which is also responsible for deleting the allocated memory. In case a mismatch in the return type of the jitted function given to the Vary call is detected, we throw an error to inform the user they should return an RVec for the Vary to properly work. This means that the call to JitVariationHelper does not happen, thus the memory of the node is not deallocated.

Content: Jira: https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-10491. We miss the test for reading boolean branches with `RDataFrame.AsNumpy`! Added the test and start investigating when it breaks - such as reported in the Jira ticket. Following the discussion on the forum [here](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/asnumpy-fails-with-boolean-branches/37282), we see that the error shows a missing `data` member for the `std::vector<bool>`:. ```; df.AsNumpy(); ---------------------------------------------------------------------------; AttributeError Traceback (most recent call last); <ipython-input-10-e856f5516a02> in <module>(); ----> 1 df.AsNumpy(). /Applications/root_build/lib/ROOT.pyc in _RDataFrameAsNumpy(df, columns, exclude); 429 else:; 430 tmp = numpy.empty(len(cpp_reference), dtype=numpy.object); --> 431 for i, x in enumerate(cpp_reference):; 432 tmp[i] = x # This creates only the wrapping of the objects and does not copy.; 433 py_arrays[column] = ndarray(tmp, result_ptrs[column]). AttributeError: 'vector<bool>' object has no attribute 'data'; ```. The error seems to be triggered when iterating over `std::vector<bool>` in python. My guess is some weirdness in the given std version of macOS 10.15. @etejedor We should add a test for this at the right place not only for `AsNumpy`. Edit: Added a fix for current PyROOT by protecting the tp_iter field for `vector<bool>`.

Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The content provided appears to be a compiler error log. It includes detailed information about template-related errors in C++ code, such as undeclared identifiers and issues with trait definitions. These are primarily code-level issues rather than discussions of software architecture concepts or principles. There is no mention of architectural patterns, design decisions, system structure, or other high-level concerns. Instead, it focuses on specific compilation problems that a developer might encounter while coding, which falls under the realm of implementation details and error handling."
