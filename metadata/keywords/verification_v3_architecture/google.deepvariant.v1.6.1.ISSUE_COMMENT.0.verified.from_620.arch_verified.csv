Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: Hi @ruolin ,; thanks for reporting this issue. I'll try running on your BAM and reference and see if we can reproduce the issue.; We have in the past seen cases where the jobs run out of memory, and our error messages in that situation isn't very clear. So @danielecook 's guess of OOM makes sense. But the memory you're reporting sounds like it should be enough. So let me see if I can reproduce this issue.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content discusses issues related to memory usage (Out Of Memory), which affects the system's ability to run jobs smoothly. It mentions checking for reproduction of the issue and ensuring that past solutions are considered. This aligns with the concept of Availability, as it involves addressing potential failures and ensuring minimal downtime by resolving such issues. The mention of OOM is a known cause affecting reliability, thus reflecting on the availability aspect.","

Content: Hi Alex,. Thank you for your patience. We were able to reproduce your issue and have determined that it is likely caused by `htslib`. In particular, DV uses `htslib` version `1.13` which only experimentally supports CRAM v3.1. Updating the `htslib` version to the latest (`1.18`) fixed this issue for me. You can update `htslib` yourself for the time being by updating [this section](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6/WORKSPACE#L24-L32).; ```; http_archive(; name = ""htslib"",; build_file = ""//:third_party/htslib.BUILD"",; sha256 = ""f1ab53a593a2320a1bfadf4ef915dae784006c5b5c922c8a8174d7530a9af18f"",; strip_prefix = ""htslib-1.18"",; urls = [; ""https://github.com/samtools/htslib/releases/download/1.18/htslib-1.18.tar.bz2"",; ],; ); ```. Please note that I have not yet tried `htslib 1.18` in other workflows, and those might be affected by the change: there is a chance this change has negative consequences in other circumstances. That said, if you are currently blocked in your workflow you can give that a try! Meanwhile, we are working on updating `htslib` on our end to be included it in the next release.

Yes proper representation on X chromosome is important, and it's caused this problem for downstream analyses of pathogenic hemizygous variants.

Content: Hi Andrew,; Thanks for answering my questions.It is very informative.; Currently I am using the GATK pipeline to identify any novel strains for a; particular bacteria genus. So far it makes sense, meaning the known mutated; locations on the genome can be found using the pipeline. However, there are; a lot of possible false positives, which could be either potential new; SNPs, or just sequencing error. That's what prompted me to explore; DeepVarient in the first place, to minimize false positives from sequencing; error.; As I understand that GATK has a step to incorporate known variants to; correct for downstream analysis. But bacteria in general do not have those; information. I am wondering do you have any toolbox on this topic?; I'd love to perform some comparisons between different variant detection of; bacteria genomes in the near future.

Content: Hi Paul, thanks for mentioning this issue.; I looked at our documentation and noticed that an update was made to our README a few days ago with this extra description:. Pre-built binaries are available at [gs://deepvariant/](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/deepvariant).; These are compiled to use SSE4 and AVX instructions, so you'll need a CPU (such as Intel Sandy Bridge) that supports them. (The file /proc/cpuinfo lists these features under ""flags"".). But it seems like this new information to the doc hasn't be synced to the external GitHub yet. This should come out in the new year at the latest. I suspect we'd like to keep the pre-built binary having optimization. But we will at least add that line of disclaimer so that it's clear what the binaries are built for.; Would it be ok for you to build DeepVariant for your CPU by following [Building and testing; DeepVariant](docs/deepvariant-build-test.md), or do you need pre-built binaries without AVX from us?
Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"This conversation focuses on pre-built binaries, their optimization for specific CPU instructions (SSE4 and AVX), and the process of building DeepVariant from source. While there's a mention of documentation updates and syncing with GitHub, it doesn't delve into architectural patterns, design decisions, system structure, or interactions relevant to software architecture."

But somethings confused me again, for example, my research topic is about repeat times in the NGS data, and my original intention in using Deepvariant is to detect the sequencing noise and delete them or find the true data in noised data. However ,what I saw is that the Deepvariant only can print one mutation such like following string:. chx xxxxxx .	TAAA	T	1.6	RefCall	.	GT:GQ:DP:AD:VAF:PL	./.:5:490:36,81:0.165306:0,3,25. This is very contrary to common sense, because in this loci it have at least 490 reads to cover it (it maybe more because Deepvariant can't recognize all reads due to empty align), Deepvariant only give one mutation that is TAAA to T, but when I open IGV to focus on the loci, it shows that they are more than one mutation, in fact, it's far more than one mutation. I mentioned in the previous paragraph that I am very grateful for your reply because you give me one tip is that :"" Keep in mind, the pileup images for DeepVariant are ~100 reads, so it will randomly down-sample from the reads to fit into the maximum of the allowed pileup image.""

Content: Hi,. Thanks for providing all of that information, it is very helpful. The issue does actually lie in pyclif and protobuf. We use an older version of protobuf that is stable with pyclif; updating it will break the interoperability between C++ and Python (the source of that seg fault). Our tests in `build_and_test.sh` do not appear to catch this, of which I have made a note to update in the future. . Is there a reason you cannot use our Docker builds from `1.6.1`? Also, if docker does not work for you, are you able to use singularity? I am unsure that brute forcing a docker build will lead to a container that runs everything as intended.

Availability,"Hi,. Thanks for your answer. It is good to know that pyclif and protobuf is the problem.

Data:

Content: I guess the core question for the variant caller is, (whether or not fully normalized as you have written) whether the raw calls can be interpreted without contradictions by a downstream method (notwithstanding the VCF standard). Considering GT=0 to be ""non-ALT"" instead of ""REF allele"" for such call clusters does seem to work in these cases (though I am not aware of a standardization of such an interpretation). The code I have referenced from DeepVariant above seems to try to filter out cases that do not make sense for such clusters of calls, so a downstream method that assumes GT=0 to imply ""non-ALT"" might work smoothly almost all the time (except perhaps when the algorithm aborts). I also didn't have an idea as to whether, as a method developer, you considered these to be corner cases, and your comment above has provided an answer to that. I myself do not have any measurements on how prevalent these types of cases are, but I encountered some of these cases recently. I will make another post here if I learn anything further about this, but I understand the point-of-view behind the original piece of code that I posted. Thanks!

Content: Pi-Chuan;; Thanks for this update and work. For bazel, we'd gotten that updated and building on conda with CentOS 6 so are good to go with that dependency, it's really just CLIF that we're struggling with for building. For clif, this is great progress, thank you. I resuscitated my bioconda build script and gave it a try with this.

Content: Sorry about the install issues. The `post-link.sh` script that is failing downloads the trained models that DeepVariant uses from Google Buckets:. https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/master/recipes/deepvariant/post-link.sh. Failures here are typically due to problems with gsutil picking up other configuration options on your system. This thread has a bunch of debugging and some suggestions to try to work around the gsutil problem:. https://github.com/bcbio/bcbio-nextgen/issues/2613. If you can try the tips there and let us know more details of the failures if you get stuck happy to help with specific suggestions. Hope this gets deepvariant installed for you.

If you're using the run_deepvariant one-step script, you can add:. ```bash; --postprocess_variants_extra_args=""cpus=0""; ```. and see if that works for you. Please let us know. We'll try to make this more robust in the future!

    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.

Content: Thanks, Andrew!; I totally understand the priority setting. In the meantime, I've collected some DV-1.5.0 resource usage data on a particular sample (note the scattering schemes aren't the same between the two references). Overall it's making really good use of the resources available (**_maybe_** except the memory, but it's more likely I over-allocated). Hopefully, it can help your team with further tuning.; [30X.human.GRCh38.deepvariant.regular-resources-usage.pdf](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/files/11501324/30X.human.GRCh38.deepvariant.regular-resources-usage.pdf); [30X.human.T2T.deepvariant.regular-resources-usage.pdf](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/files/11501325/30X.human.T2T.deepvariant.regular-resources-usage.pdf).

Availability,"This is impressive work! Though it looks pretty cool, let's ask ourselves what is happening here. The biological system went through clonal events (let's suppose under some non-random selective conditions), where the sequencer hopefully captured the state of those events as complete as possible (i.e. with minimal error). Then we pass those through two processes (DeepVariant and Clair3), which respond with areas of variation mirroring previous signals it was trained with to maximally respond upon.

Content: This is impressive work! Though it looks pretty cool, let's ask ourselves what is happening here. The biological system went through clonal events (let's suppose under some non-random selective conditions), where the sequencer hopefully captured the state of those events as complete as possible (i.e. with minimal error). Then we pass those through two processes (DeepVariant and Clair3), which respond with areas of variation mirroring previous signals it was trained with to maximally respond upon.

Content: comparison, you can see what is reported from precisionFDA (when running DeepVariant on my samples) for the [provided .bam alignment](https://precision.fda.gov/comparisons/3435) or the [BWA-MEM re-aligned comparison](https://precision.fda.gov/comparisons/3436). There are two numbers because a “*partial*” recovery just checks for the presence of a variant (either heterozygous or homozygous). Due to formatting differences (such as with indels), I didn’t feel comfortable showing comparisons between variant callers on my page with notes/code on my [Genos Exome sample](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/tree/master/Genos_Exome), but I think this is OK when using the same variant caller on different samples. For comparison, the precisionFDA comparison for the provided .vcf files is [here](https://precision.fda.gov/comparisons/3434), and these are the statistics for the provided .vcf files (from my script):; ```; 39494 / 41450 (95.3%) full SNP recovery; 39678 / 41450 (95.7%) partial SNP recovery; ```. I am omitted the indel statistics from my script because Veritas used freebayes for variant calling (and I’m not converting the indel format, causing the indel count to be quite low, presumably because most overlapped a homopolymer of at least 2 nucleotides). **Still, maybe it is interesting that the “*full*” SNP recovery was higher for the provided variants, but the “*partial*” SNP recovery was higher for DeepVariant?** The precisionFDA comparison (for my samples) shows better results for DeepVariant than the provided VCF files (but there are going to be considerably fewer indels for the overall counts). Going back to _point 4_, running DeepVariant with both my provided .bam alignment (after combining the per-chromosome alignments) and BWA-MEM re-aligned reads both resulted in a set of ~7 million reads (which is closer to the total number reported in that other study for DeepVariant). However, if you emphasize precision, perhaps that somewhat matches my filtered set (i

Availability,"eature is not necessarily bad, but both using and training with the T2T reference might help it adjust its priors for how likely this is in the T2T reference (we had a [poster](https://twitter.com/acarroll_ATG/status/1231655024213856256) discussing this phenomenon and how DeepVariant reacts to it). .

Quality Attribute: Availability
Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: h both my provided .bam alignment (after combining the per-chromosome alignments) and BWA-MEM re-aligned reads both resulted in a set of ~7 million reads (which is closer to the total number reported in that other study for DeepVariant). However, if you emphasize precision, perhaps that somewhat matches my filtered set (in terms of the SNP counts and more noticeable indel differences for homozygous/heterozygous recovery). Namely, I can obtain higher percentages with my script if I use GATK HaplotypeCaller (with `--dontUseSoftClippedBases`)+VariantFiltration (similar to [shown here](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/run_GATK_VarScan.py), for Exome file, but not WGS, and I used GATK version 3.x instead of 4.x) and filter for on-target reads, as shown below:. ```; 20765 / 21141 (98.2%) full SNP recovery; 20872 / 21141 (98.7%) partial SNP recovery; 243 / 258 (94.2%) full insertion recovery; 249 / 258 (96.5%) partial insertion recovery; 208 / 228 (91.2%) full deletion recovery; 213 / 228 (93.4%) partial deletion recovery; ```. That being said, maximizing those recovery statistics does decrease the total number of variants, particularly the indels. Nevertheless, [the precisionFDA comparison for that GATK quality-fitered variant set](https://precision.fda.gov/comparisons/3441) indicates increased precision for the RefSeq CDS variants (but decreased sensitivity), compared to DeepVariant (or an [unfiltered GATK variant set](https://precision.fda.gov/comparisons/3442)). **6)** If you go back to the original precisionFDA results, I think this is also consistent with HG002:; If you go to “[explore results](https://precision.fda.gov/challenges/truth/results-explore)"", and select “**func_cds**” (which is where I would expect most of the clinically actionable variants to be) DeepVariant is **not** top ranked for either F-score, Recall, or Precision (although the values are high, like the other variant calling results).

Availability,"iables in the TRAINABLE_VARIABLES collection -- if you need to warm-start non_TRAINABLE vars (such as optimizer accumulators or batch norm statistics), please use the below option.; ```; Because in our code, we use a regular expression like this:; https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/aff131aac3bd0cb63ee8314e32bcbf5590987fb8/deepvariant/modeling.py#L361. This means that only the variables in the TRAINABLE_VARIABLES get loaded when we warm start.; This explains why warm starting from a checkpoint does not produce the same (or even similar) results as the inference/prediction mode. For example, Batch norms were not being warmstarted. If you do want to load **everything**, one trick we've tried is to change to code into a list:; ```; vars_to_warm_start=['|'.join(vars_to_include)]); ```; which then tricks the code into the model of loading everything (not just TRAINABLE_VARIABLES). But, it doesn't seem very desirable because it also loads things like global_step. The best way is probably to include just BatchNorm and the Trainable variables we want, but it'll require more refactoring here. If try with the small code change above and observe the log -- you'll see that a lot more vars are being used in warm-starting now. (But note that you'll likely want to exclude some variables such as global_step, because those will affect your learning rate). Note that even when warmstarting from an existing checkpoint, we don't currently recommend ""fine-tuning"" with very few steps. Even with our small TPU training case study, we showed an example to train up to 50k steps before we pick a model.; So if you want to use our code to fine tune on your data, please proceed with caution and make sure you carefully benchmark the accuracy and robustness of the resulting model. .

Content: iables in the TRAINABLE_VARIABLES collection -- if you need to warm-start non_TRAINABLE vars (such as optimizer accumulators or batch norm statistics), please use the below option.; ```; Because in our code, we use a regular expression like this:; https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/aff131aac3bd0cb63ee8314e32bcbf5590987fb8/deepvariant/modeling.py#L361. This means that only the variables in the TRAINABLE_VARIABLES get loaded when we warm start.; This explains why warm starting from a checkpoint does not produce the same (or even similar) results as the inference/prediction mode. For example, Batch norms were not being warmstarted. If you do want to load **everything**, one trick we've tried is to change to code into a list:; ```; vars_to_warm_start=['|'.join(vars_to_include)]); ```; which then tricks the code into the model of loading everything (not just TRAINABLE_VARIABLES). But, it doesn't seem very desirable because it also loads things like global_step. The best way is probably to include just BatchNorm and the Trainable variables we want, but it'll require more refactoring here. If try with the small code change above and observe the log -- you'll see that a lot more vars are being used in warm-starting now. (But note that you'll likely want to exclude some variables such as global_step, because those will affect your learning rate). Note that even when warmstarting from an existing checkpoint, we don't currently recommend ""fine-tuning"" with very few steps. Even with our small TPU training case study, we showed an example to train up to 50k steps before we pick a model.; So if you want to use our code to fine tune on your data, please proceed with caution and make sure you carefully benchmark the accuracy and robustness of the resulting model. .

So, starting for my test (checking recovery of my CDS Exome variants in my WGS dataset), **the recovery numbers were very close to what I originally expected (98-99% for SNPs, ~90% for indels)**:. **Provided Exome on Provided WGS .bam Alignment**:; ```; 68759 / 72556 (94.8%) full SNP recovery; 71276 / 72556 (98.2%) partial SNP recovery; 3027 / 3648 (83.0%) full insertion recovery; 3413 / 3648 (93.6%) partial insertion recovery; 3119 / 3911 (79.7%) full deletion recovery; 3596 / 3911 (91.9%) partial deletion recovery; ```. **BWA-MEM Exome on WGS (for only on-target alignments)**:; ```; 51417 / 54229 (94.8%) full SNP recovery; 53116 / 54229 (97.9%) partial SNP recovery; 1964 / 2391 (82.1%) full insertion recovery; 2242 / 2391 (93.8%) partial insertion recovery; 2058 / 2537 (81.1%) full deletion recovery; 2349 / 2537 (92.6%) partial deletion recovery; ```. For comparison, you can see what is reported from precisionFDA (when running DeepVariant on my samples) for the [provided .bam alignment](https://precision.fda.gov/comparisons/3435) or the [BWA-MEM re-aligned comparison](https://precision.fda.gov/comparisons/3436). There are two numbers because a “*partial*” recovery just checks for the presence of a variant (either heterozygous or homozygous). Due to formatting differences (such as with indels), I didn’t feel comfortable showing comparisons between variant callers on my page with notes/code on my [Genos Exome sample](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/tree/master/Genos_Exome), but I think this is OK when using the same variant caller on different samples.

When performing variant calling, DeepVariant can only use `.ckpt` model files - not `.pb` files - as specified under the [*Convert model.ckpt to model.pb*](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-details.md#convert-modelckpt-to-modelpb-savedmodel-format) section. May I ask why you might need the ProtoBuf formatted file? . $`3)`$ Regarding the `model.ckpt.example_info.json` file, it is used to validate the checkpointed model's JSON file with the JSON file generated for the examples files, matching against a few specs such as channels and shape (tensor image dimensions), to ensure data and model match before performing variant calling.

",True,"The provided content includes a bash script and its execution output. The script checks for the existence of a file using `[ -f $ref_idx ]`, which correctly evaluates whether `$ref_idx` exists. This aligns with the concept of availability as it ensures the system can perform functions when required by checking file existence. However, the subsequent `ls` commands fail due to incorrect paths, indicating potential issues with path resolution or permissions, which may not directly relate to availability but rather to correct configuration or access rights. The main focus on file existence is relevant to availability.","
