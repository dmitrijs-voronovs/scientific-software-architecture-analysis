Data:

Content: fraction; of cells (obs) that have a non-zero value for genes (var). For each var_name and each `groupby` category a dot is plotted.; Each dot represents two values: mean expression within each category; (visualized by color) and fraction of cells expressing the `var_name` in the; category (visualized by the size of the dot). If `groupby` is not given,; the dotplot assumes that all data belongs to a single category. .. note::; A gene is considered expressed if the expression value in the `adata` (or; `adata.raw`) is above the specified threshold which is zero by default. An example of dotplot usage is to visualize, for multiple marker genes,; the mean value and the percentage of cells expressing the gene; across multiple clusters. Parameters; ----------; {common_plot_args}; title; Title for the figure; expression_cutoff; Expression cutoff that is used for binarizing the gene expression and; determining the fraction of cells expressing given genes. A gene is; expressed only if the expression value is greater than this threshold.; mean_only_expressed; If True, gene expression is averaged only over the cells; expressing the given genes.; standard_scale; Whether or not to standardize that dimension between 0 and 1,; meaning for each variable or group,; subtract the minimum and divide each by its maximum.; kwds; Are passed to :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.scatter`.

Here, by default,; we use the implementation of *scikit-learn* :cite:p:`Pedregosa2011`.

Parameters; ----------; adata; Annotated data matrix.; {doc_n_pcs}; {use_rep}; perplexity; The perplexity is related to the number of nearest neighbors that; is used in other manifold learning algorithms. Larger datasets; usually require a larger perplexity. Consider selecting a value; between 5 and 50. The choice is not extremely critical since t-SNE; is quite insensitive to this parameter.; metric; Distance metric calculate neighbors on.; early_exaggeration; Controls how tight natural clusters in the original space are in the; embedded space and how much space will be between them. For larger; values, the space between natural clusters will be larger in the; embedded space. Again, the choice of this parameter is not very; critical. If the cost function increases during initial optimization,; the early exaggeration factor or the learning rate might be too high.; learning_rate; Note that the R-package ""Rtsne"" uses a default of 200.; The learning rate can be a critical parameter. It should be; between 100 and 1000. If the cost function increases during initial; optimization, the early exaggeration factor or the learning rate; might be too high. If the cost function gets stuck in a bad local; minimum increasing the learning rate helps sometimes.; random_state; Change this to use different intial states for the optimization.; If `None`, the initial state is not reproducible.; n_jobs; Number of jobs for parallel computation.; `None` means u

",True,"The content discusses various parameters such as scale, log1p, hidden_size, batchnorm, activation, init, network_kwds, epochs, reduce_lr, early_stop, batch_size, optimizer, random_state, threads, learning_rate, verbose, training_kwds, return_model, return_info, and copy. These terms are related to the configuration of an autoencoder model, which is part of the setup for a machine learning model. Usability in software engineering focuses on how effectively users can use the software, but this content is about setting up model parameters. However, if the autoencoder's usability was being discussed (e.g., user-friendly interface or accessibility), then it would be relevant. In this context, since the discussion is about model configuration parameters, it does not directly relate to usability as defined.","
