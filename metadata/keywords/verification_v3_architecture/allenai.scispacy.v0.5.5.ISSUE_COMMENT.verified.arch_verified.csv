",True,"The content provided is a log snippet from a pip installation process. It includes error messages related to building wheels for numpy and nmslib packages. The error mentions that the wheel build failed, leading to the use of the legacy setup.py install method. This relates to deployability in software engineering as deployment often involves ensuring that packages can be installed correctly without issues. The problem described (wheel build failure) indirectly affects deployability by causing a manual installation step instead of an automated one, which is a key aspect of deployability. Therefore, this content accurately reflects the quality attribute Deployability.","

4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided is a log snippet from an installation process using Docker and pip. It details compilation errors and build issues encountered during installation, which are related to deployment and installation challenges. The user mentions that the installation succeeds later on when another library depends on it. This indicates issues with deployability as the initial attempt failed but succeeded upon retrying. Key aspects such as automation, speed, and rollback (implicitly through retries) are discussed here. Therefore, this content accurately reflects the Deployability quality attribute.","

4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The provided content appears to be log output from an installation process using pip. The logs indicate issues with building wheels for certain packages (e.g., numpy and nmslib) due to a subprocess error during cleaning of the build directory. This relates to deployment challenges, specifically the inability to deploy software efficiently because wheel builds failed. Key aspects mentioned in the logs are automation failure and deployment issues. Therefore, this content aligns with Deployability as it discusses problems encountered during deployment (building and installing packages) which is part of the overall deployability aspect.","

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.

Performance,"Hi @ChantalvanSon ,. Great that you got it working, sorry it was a bit tricky. You raise some good points - there is one way that you can not require your function which loads all the pieces which is this:. ```python; from scispacy.candidate_generation import DEFAULT_PATHS, DEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_BASES; from scispacy.candidate_generation import (; CandidateGenerator,; LinkerPaths; ).

The reason that this is not quite accurate is that it is possible that the datapoints that you remove for a given K are ""hard"" in some sense, and the accuracy over this subset for top 1 is actually higher than over the whole dataset (this is likely to be the case), which is why this number is a lower bound of the normalized accuracy. . I am currently working on some integration stuff with `allennlp` (see https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/pull/3040) to make it easier to hook in more complicated models, and I also want to try the entity linker from spacy too. I've just re-read the medmentions paper and it seems like they added much more detail about the st21pv subset - previously when I'd read it I thought it was much more specific to IR. I think possibly we should switch over to this subset as it sounds more likely to reflect what people actually want out of an entity linker. It seems like some useful evaluations would be the following:. - P/R/F1 on the st21pv subset with gold mentions; - mention detection P/R/F1 on the st21pv subset. It would also be helpful to know the coverage of our kb on this subset as well as what % of annotated concepts in this subset have definitions. I will try to work on these things over the next couple of weeks.

The Entity linker does unfortunately use a lot of memory, because of the search. 3. UMLS is an extremely big KB - 2.3M concepts. We have other ones which are much, much smaller, and higher precision. E.g the `mesh` linker only has around 30k entities and is much cleaner. Using MESH, the runtime (without changing the EFS paramter, see below) is 2.41s. 4. The Candidate Generator which the entity linker uses has a parameter which controls the speed/precision trade off for the approximate nearest neighbours search (the numbers here are measuring ANN queries per second). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16001974/97484674-4acf3300-1916-11eb-924e-12941df0fd6e.png). By default, we set this parameter to `200`. You can change this value to speed up the search substantially, for a small ish cost in recall:. https://github.com/allenai/scispacy/blob/master/scispacy/candidate_generation.py#L204. Let me know if that's helpful!

The first paragraph here raises a general question I had, is the UMLS data used only for the NER or is it a larger part of the model? I.e. if I created my own EntityLinker using 2022AB UMLS, would that solve this ""outdated"" issue?

So it looks like scispacy adds a custom attribute_ruler, but both scispacy and spacy use the same sentencizer? Does that sound right?. scispacy gives much better results than spacy for abstracts. Here's an example. . en_core_sci_md:. ```; Abstract Our goal is to learn task-independent representations of academic papers.; Inspired by the recent success of pretrained Transformer language models across various NLP tasks, we use the Transformer model architecture as basis of encoding the input paper.; Existing LMs such as BERT, however, are primarily based on masked language modeling objective, only considering intra-document context and do not use any inter-document information.; This limits their ability to learn optimal document representations.; To learn high-quality documentlevel representations we propose using citations as an inter-document relatedness signal and formulate it as a triplet loss learning objective.; We then pretrain the model on a large corpus of citations using this objective, encouraging it to output representations that are more similar for papers that share a citation link than for those that do not.; Representation learning is a critical ingredient for natural language processing systems.; Recent Transformer language models like BERT learn powerful textual representations, but these models are targeted towards token- and sentence-level training objectives and do not leverage information on inter-document relatedness, which limits their document-level representation power.; For applications on scientific documents, such as classification and recommendation, the embeddings power strong performance on end tasks.; We propose SPECTER, a new method to generate document-leve

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
