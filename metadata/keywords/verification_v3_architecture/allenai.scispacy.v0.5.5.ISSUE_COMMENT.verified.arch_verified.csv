4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided is a log snippet from a pip installation process. It includes error messages related to building wheels for numpy and nmslib packages. The error mentions that the wheel build failed, leading to the use of the legacy setup.py install method. This relates to deployability in software engineering as deployment often involves ensuring that packages can be installed correctly without issues. The problem described (wheel build failure) indirectly affects deployability by causing a manual installation step instead of an automated one, which is a key aspect of deployability. Therefore, this content accurately reflects the quality attribute Deployability.","

Deployability,"Hi @DeNeutoy, thanks for the information! I'm happy to share that I managed to create my custom Entity Linker based on the 2020AA release.

4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The provided content appears to be log output from an installation process using pip. The logs indicate issues with building wheels for certain packages (e.g., numpy and nmslib) due to a subprocess error during cleaning of the build directory. This relates to deployment challenges, specifically the inability to deploy software efficiently because wheel builds failed. Key aspects mentioned in the logs are automation failure and deployment issues. Therefore, this content aligns with Deployability as it discusses problems encountered during deployment (building and installing packages) which is part of the overall deployability aspect.","

",True,"The content discusses loading and configuring pre-trained models for candidate generation in scispacy, including handling various file paths and configurations. This involves optimizing resource usage by properly initializing indices and vectors, which directly relates to performance aspects of the system such as efficient event handling and response times.

Content: Hi @ChantalvanSon ,. Great that you got it working, sorry it was a bit tricky. You raise some good points - there is one way that you can not require your function which loads all the pieces which is this:. ```python; from scispacy.candidate_generation import DEFAULT_PATHS, DEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_BASES; from scispacy.candidate_generation import (; CandidateGenerator,; LinkerPaths; ). CustomLinkerPaths_2020AA = LinkerPaths(; ann_index=""path/to/nmslib_index.bin"",; tfidf_vectorizer=""path/to//nmslib_index.bin"",; tfidf_vectors=""path/to/tfidf_vectorizer.joblib"",; concept_aliases_list=""path/to/concept_aliases.json"",; ); class UMLS2020KnowledgeBase(KnowledgeBase):; def __init__(; self,; file_path: str = ""path/to/2020AA.json"",; ):; super().__init__(file_path). # Admittedly this is a bit of a hack, because we are mutating a global object.; # However, it's just a kind of registry, so maybe it's ok.; DEFAULT_PATHS[""umls2020""] = CustomLinkerPaths_2020AA; DEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_BASES[""umls2020""] = UMLS2020KnowledgeBase. linker = CandidateGenerator(name=""umls2020""). ```. Overall, we have it like this so that we can present the simplest possible interface to people who are using scispacy (i.e being able to just pass names to get particular linkers rather than having to know the internals of how the linker is implemented).

",True,"While the code snippet itself focuses on implementation details (registering linkers in a specific library), the discussion revolves around architectural decisions and design choices. 

The conversation touches upon:

* **Architectural trade-offs:**  The author acknowledges that the current approach of mutating global objects is a 'hack' and discusses alternatives like decorators or functions to register linker information, highlighting the consideration of maintainability and code organization.
* **Interface simplicity vs. extensibility:** The discussion aims to balance providing a simple interface for users (`passing names to get linkers`) with allowing for custom/specific linkers, pointing towards architectural considerations for future growth and flexibility.

Therefore, the content demonstrates awareness of architectural concerns even within the context of implementation specifics."

Safety,"wing:. There are 3 things we want to evaluate when doing end to end linking: 1) mention detection, 2) candidate generation and 3) choosing the right candidate. It's clear how to ablate the mention detection - just use gold mentions.

This separates out performance between the generation step and the selection step. The reason I then took the recall@1/recall@k is that the linker is currently only based on string similarity, so to get a single output you just take the one with the highest score. The reason that this is not quite accurate is that it is possible that the datapoints that you remove for a given K are ""hard"" in some sense, and the accuracy over this subset for top 1 is actually higher than over the whole dataset (this is likely to be the case), which is why this number is a lower bound of the normalized accuracy. .

Data:

Content: Makes sense. So it seems to pretty much be working with a bit of a workaround. The files are initially cached to `/root/.scispacy/datasets/`. After caching, move the cache folder to a permanent folder on Google drive:. ```python; !mv /root/.scispacy/ /content/gdrive/MyDrive/test/; !ls /content/gdrive/MyDrive/test/.scispacy/; >>> datasets; ```. To update the environment variable, as described:. ```python; import os; os.environ['SCISPACY_CACHE'] = '/content/gdrive/MyDrive/test/.scispacy/'; ```. However, this alone does not find the cached files. It will re-download the files again. In order to see the new environment variable, it's necessary to restart the runtime: `Runtime->Restart runtime`. Now when running the entity linker, it will see the _permanently_ cached files. So is an enhancement necessary? It'd definitely be easier and more foolproof to simply add a parameter such as `cache_folder` to the `nlp.add_pipe()` method. For example:. ```python; nlp.add_pipe(; ""scispacy_linker"",; config={; ""resolve_abbreviations"": True,; ""linker_name"": ""umls"",; ""cache_folder"": ""/content/gdrive/MyDrive/test/""}); ```. which would then be used to look for a subfolder `.scispacy`, i.e. `/content/gdrive/MyDrive/test/.scispacy/` in this case.

Here's an example. . en_core_sci_md:. ```; Abstract Our goal is to learn task-independent representations of academic papers.; Inspired by the recent success of pretrained Transformer language models across various NLP tasks, we use the Transformer model architecture as basis of encoding the input paper.; Existing LMs such as BERT, however, are primarily based on masked language modeling objective, only considering intra-document context and do not use any inter-document information.; This limits their ability to learn optimal document representations.; To learn high-quality documentlevel representations we propose using citations as an inter-document relatedness signal and formulate it as a triplet loss learning objective.; We then pretrain the model on a large corpus of citations using this objective, encouraging it to output representations that are more similar for papers that share a citation link than for those that do not.; Representation learning is a critical ingredient for natural language processing systems.; Recent Transformer language models like BERT learn powerful textual representations, but these models are targeted towards token- and sentence-level training objectives and do not leverage information on inter-document relatedness, which limits their document-level representation power.; For applications on scientific documents, such as classification and recommendation, the embeddings power strong performance on end tasks.; We propose SPECTER, a new method to generate document-leve

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
