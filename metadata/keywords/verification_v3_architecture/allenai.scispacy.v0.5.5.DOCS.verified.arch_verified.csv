Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: the 'installing via pip' section. 1. [Follow the installation instructions for Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html). 2. Create a Conda environment called ""scispacy"" with Python 3.9 (any version >= 3.6 should work):. ```bash; mamba create -n scispacy python=3.10; ```. 3. Activate the Mamba environment. You will need to activate the Conda environment in each terminal in which you want to use scispaCy. ```bash; mamba activate scispacy; ```. Now you can install `scispacy` and one of the models using the steps above. Once you have completed the above steps and downloaded one of the models below, you can load a scispaCy model as you would any other spaCy model. For example:; ```python; import spacy; nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_sci_sm""); doc = nlp(""Alterations in the hypocretin receptor 2 and preprohypocretin genes produce narcolepsy in some animals.""); ```. #### Note on upgrading; If you are upgrading `scispacy`, you will need to download the models again, to get the model versions compatible with the version of `scispacy` that you have. The link to the model that you download should contain the version number of `scispacy` that you have. ## Available Models. To install a model, click on the link below to download the model, and then run . ```python; pip install </path/to/download>; ```.

Content:  using spaCy for scientific documents. In particular, there is a custom tokenizer that adds tokenization rules on top of spaCy's; rule-based tokenizer, a POS tagger and syntactic parser trained on biomedical data and; an entity span detection model. Separately, there are also NER models for more specific tasks. **Just looking to test out the models on your data? Check out our [demo](https://scispacy.apps.allenai.org)** (Note: this demo is running an older version of scispaCy and may produce different results than the latest version). ## Installation; Installing scispacy requires two steps: installing the library and intalling the models. To install the library, run:; ```bash; pip install scispacy; ```. to install a model (see our full selection of available models below), run a command like the following:. ```bash; pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.4/en_core_sci_sm-0.5.4.tar.gz; ```. Note: We strongly recommend that you use an isolated Python environment (such as virtualenv or conda) to install scispacy.; Take a look below in the ""Setting up a virtual environment"" section if you need some help with this.; Additionally, scispacy uses modern features of Python and as such is only available for **Python 3.6 or greater**. ### Installation note: nmslib; Over the years, installing nmslib has becomes quite difficult. There are a number of GitHub issues on scispaCy and the nmslib repo itself about this. This matrix is an attempt to help users install nmslib in whatever environment they have. I don't have access to every type of environment, so if you are able to test something out, please open an issue or pull request!. | | Windows 11 | Windows Subsystem for Linux | Mac M1 | Mac M2 | Mac M3 | Intel Mac |; |---------------|------------|----------------------------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|; | Python 3.8 | ✅ | ✅ | 💻 | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ |; | Python 3.9 | ❌🐍 | ✅ | 💻 | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ |; | Python 3.10 | ❌🐍 | ✅ | ❓ | ❓ | ❓ | ✅ |; | Pyt

You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Data:

Content: ; ### Creating a release. Scispacy has two components:. - The scispacy pip package; - The scispacy models. The scispacy pip package is published automatically using the `.github/actions/publish.yml` github action. It happens whenever a release is published (with an associated tag) in the github releases UI. In order to create a new release, the following should happen:. #### Updating `scispacy/version.py`; Update the version in version.py. #### Training new models. The entire pipeline can be run using `spacy project run all`. This will train and package all the models. The packages should then be uploaded to the `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/{VERSION}` S3 bucket, and references to previous models (e.g in the readme and in the docs) should be updated. You can find all these places using `git grep <previous version>`. The scripts `install_local_packages.py`, `install_remote_packages.py`, `print_out_metrics.py`, `smoke_test.py`, and `uninstall_local_packages.py` are useful for testing at each step of the process. Before uploading, `install_local_packages.py` and `smoke_test.py` can be used to make sure the packages are installable and do a quick check of output. `print_out_metrics.py` can then be used to easily get the metrics that need to be updated in the README. Once the packages have been uploaded, `uninstall_local_packages.py`, `install_remote_packages.py`, and `smoke_test.py` can be used to ensure everything was uploaded correctly. #### Merge a PR with the above changes; Merge a PR with the above changes, and publish a release with a tag corresponding to the commit from the merged PR. This should trigger the publish github action, which will create the `scispacy` package and publish it to pypi. 
Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The content describes steps for creating a release, including updating version numbers, training models, and uploading packages to S3. It mentions using various scripts and GitHub actions but does not discuss high-level system structure or architectural decisions. Instead, it focuses on the process of releasing software, which is more about deployment and maintenance than architecture."

You can access the list of abbreviations via the `doc._.abbreviations` attribute and for a given abbreviation,; you can access it's long form (which is a `spacy.tokens.Span`) using `span._.long_form`, which will point to; another span in the document. #### Example Usage; ```python; import spacy. from scispacy.abbreviation import AbbreviationDetector. nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_sci_sm""). # Add the abbreviation pipe to the spacy pipeline.; nlp.add_pipe(""abbreviation_detector""). doc = nlp(""Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an \; inherited motor neuron disease caused by the expansion \; of a polyglutamine tract within the androgen receptor (AR). \; SBMA can be caused by this easily.""). print(""Abbreviation"", ""\t"", ""Definition""); for abrv in doc._.abbreviations:; 	print(f""{abrv} \t ({abrv.start}, {abrv.end}) {abrv._.long_form}""). >>> Abbreviation	 Span	 Definition; >>> SBMA 		 (33, 34) Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy; >>> SBMA 	 	 (6, 7) Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy; >>> AR 		 (29, 30) androgen receptor; ```. > **Note**; > If you want to be able to [serialize your `doc` objects](https://spacy.io/usage/saving-loading), load the abbreviation detector with `make_serializable=True`, e.g. `nlp.add_pipe(""abbreviation_detector"", config={""make_serializable"": True})`. ### EntityLinker. The `EntityLinker` is a SpaCy component which performs linking to a knowledge base. The linker simply performs; a string overlap - based search (char-3grams) on named entities, comparing them with the concepts in a knowledge base; using an approximate neares

Modifiability,"n. In this study, we fabricated prevascularized synthetic device ports to help mitigate this limitation. Membranes with rectilinear arrays of square pores with widths ranging from 40 to 200 μm were created using materials (50 μm thick double-sided polished silicon) and processes (photolithography and directed reactive ion etching) common in the manufacturing of microfabricated sensors. Vascular endothelial cells responded to membrane geometry by either forming vascular tubes that extended through the pore or completely filling membrane pores after 4 days in culture. Although tube formation began to predominate overgrowth around 75 μm and continued to increase at even larger pore sizes, tubes formed at these large pore sizes were not completely round and had relatively thin walls. Thus, the optimum range of pore size for prevascularization of these membranes was estimated to be 75-100 μm.

Content: psulation. In this study, we fabricated prevascularized synthetic device ports to help mitigate this limitation. Membranes with rectilinear arrays of square pores with widths ranging from 40 to 200 μm were created using materials (50 μm thick double-sided polished silicon) and processes (photolithography and directed reactive ion etching) common in the manufacturing of microfabricated sensors. Vascular endothelial cells responded to membrane geometry by either forming vascular tubes that extended through the pore or completely filling membrane pores after 4 days in culture. Although tube formation began to predominate overgrowth around 75 μm and continued to increase at even larger pore sizes, tubes formed at these large pore sizes were not completely round and had relatively thin walls. Thus, the optimum range of pore size for prevascularization of these membranes was estimated to be 75-100 μm. This study lays the foundation for creating a prevascularized port that can be used to reduce fibrous encapsulation and thus enhance diffusion to implanted medical devices and sensors. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Modifiability,"re present in aquatic environment as wastewater contaminants, and their toxic effects on aquatic species have been reported. Apoptosis has been shown to be induced by serum deprivation or copper treatment. To understand the toxicity of nonylphenol diethoxylate, we investigated the effects of NP2 EO on apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and copper by using PC12 cell system. Nonylphenol diethoxylate itself showed no toxicity and recovered cell viability from apoptosis. In addition, nonylphenol diethoxylate decreased DNA fragmentation caused by apoptosis in PC12 cells. This phenomenon was confirmed after treating apoptotic PC12 cells with nonylphenol diethoxylate, whereas the cytochrome c release into the cytosol decreased as compared to that in apoptotic cells not treated with nonylphenol diethoxylate s. Furthermore, Bax contents in apoptotic cells were reduced after exposure to nonylphenol diethoxylate. Thus, nonylphenol diethoxylate has the opposite effect on apoptosis in PC12 cells compared to nonylphenol, which enhances apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. The difference in structure of the two compounds is hypothesized to be responsible for this phenomenon. These results indicated that nonylphenol diethoxylate has capability to affect cell differentiation and development and has potentially harmful effect on organisms because of its unexpected impact on apoptosis. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided discusses installation steps for a library and model installation using pip commands. This involves setting up an isolated environment, which allows for better control and reproducibility in testing environments. The use of virtual environments can help in isolating dependencies and ensuring consistent test results. Additionally, the information on compatibility with specific Python versions (3.6+) helps in making sure that tests are run in compatible environments. This contributes to the Testability by ensuring that the software can be tested reliably and consistently across different versions. Therefore, the content accurately reflects aspects of Testability as it relates to installation and setup which facilitate testing.","

Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The content discusses installation instructions for a library and model, including Python version compatibility and dependency management. While it touches on environment setup (virtual environments), this is more about software development practices rather than the high-level architectural concerns."
