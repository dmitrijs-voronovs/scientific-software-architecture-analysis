",True,"The content provided by the user is related to an error they encountered while using scanpy. The error message indicates that the 'sum' method is not available on a 'SparseDataset' object, which suggests issues with how data is being handled in the code. This problem is likely due to changes in the library's expectations regarding data formats, such as switching from sparse to dense datasets. The user also mentions their environment and specific packages, providing context for debugging. While the main focus is on resolving an error, the underlying issue relates to data handling practices, which indirectly contributes to the overall usability of the software by ensuring proper functionality. Therefore, this content aligns with the Usability quality attribute as it addresses issues that hinder efficient task completion in data analysis workflows.","

Usability,"lt colormap shown by #1632 Other methods that set default parameters are also affected like `.add_totals()`. The following example should show the dots using the `Reds` colormap, but instead it uses the `winter` colormap because the second call sets the color map to `winter` if not given. This double call happens because when `sc.pl.dotplot()` is used (instead of `sc.pl.DotPlot`), internally a call to `.style()` is made and a subsequent explicit calls to `.style()` is required to tune the parameters as suggested in the documentation. ```python; adata = sc.datasets.pbmc68k_reduced(); markers = ['C1QA', 'PSAP', 'CD79A', 'CD79B', 'CST3', 'LYZ']; sc.pl.DotPlot(adata, markers, groupby='bulk_labels').style(cmap='Reds').style(dot_edge_color='black').show(); ```; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4964309/107354555-9628de00-6ace-11eb-9eb8-c0baaa80b1f6.png). The problem is caused by the current implementation of `sc.pl.Dotplot.style()` that set the default parameters as:. ```; def style(; self,; cmap: str = DEFAULT_COLORMAP,; color_on: Optional[Literal['dot', 'square']] = DEFAULT_COLOR_ON,; dot_max: Optional[float] = DEFAULT_DOT_MAX,; dot_min: Optional[float] = DEFAULT_DOT_MIN,; .....; ```. Where DEFAULT_* are the default values defined at the beginning of the file (see https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/blob/master/scanpy/plotting/_dotplot.py#L84) . What is nice about this is that the documentation clearly shows the default values. The downside is that optional values are assigned a default value that rewrites previous calls to style. Ideally, all optional values should be `None`, then is easy to know if a new value is passed or a previous call has already set a value.

Quality Attribute: Usability
Attribute Description: The degree to which users can effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks, including support for error recovery and user satisfaction. Usability covers ease of learning, efficient usage, and adaptability to user needs.
Content: lt colormap shown by #1632 Other methods that set default parameters are also affected like `.add_totals()`. The following example should show the dots using the `Reds` colormap, but instead it uses the `winter` colormap because the second call sets the color map to `winter` if not given. This double call happens because when `sc.pl.dotplot()` is used (instead of `sc.pl.DotPlot`), internally a call to `.style()` is made and a subsequent explicit calls to `.style()` is required to tune the parameters as suggested in the documentation. ```python; adata = sc.datasets.pbmc68k_reduced(); markers = ['C1QA', 'PSAP', 'CD79A', 'CD79B', 'CST3', 'LYZ']; sc.pl.DotPlot(adata, markers, groupby='bulk_labels').style(cmap='Reds').style(dot_edge_color='black').show(); ```; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4964309/107354555-9628de00-6ace-11eb-9eb8-c0baaa80b1f6.png). The problem is caused by the current implementation of `sc.pl.Dotplot.style()` that set the default parameters as:. ```; def style(; self,; cmap: str = DEFAULT_COLORMAP,; color_on: Optional[Literal['dot', 'square']] = DEFAULT_COLOR_ON,; dot_max: Optional[float] = DEFAULT_DOT_MAX,; dot_min: Optional[float] = DEFAULT_DOT_MIN,; .....; ```. Where DEFAULT_* are the default values defined at the beginning of the file (see https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/blob/master/scanpy/plotting/_dotplot.py#L84) . What is nice about this is that the documentation clearly shows the default values. The downside is that optional values are assigned a default value that rewrites previous calls to style. Ideally, all optional values should be `None`, then is easy to know if a new value is passed or a previous call has already set a value.

This would be similar to what's possible with `pip` and [constraints files](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#constraints-files), I don't see how one would be able to specify this for a package. I don't think it's possible, but maybe I'm missing something about the version string syntax. * Make sure the numba threading layer is `“workqueue”` after pynndescent is imported. This is tricky. pynndescent<0.5.3 takes a long time to import, so we don’t want to do this at the top level. So we would need to add a check after everytiem pynndescent could possibly be imported to check that it didn’t set the threading backend to anything else. My understanding of the numba threading system is that once you’ve called for parallel compilation, you’re locked into the threading backend for that session. * Make sure the threading layer is workqueue after pynndescent is imported, but make pynndescent import fast. A kinda simpler solution would be to require pynndescent 0.5.3, import it at the top level (boosts total import time by about ~0.2 seconds out of 3.3 total), and set the threading layer right there. This also has the advantage of letting users specify the threading layer after import scanpy and not having us interfere. This also requires that pynndescent is installed, which hits the reproducibility issues again.

Hi all!. My use case for scanpy is analysis of whole-body data from a weird marine annelid. We sort of have an idea of what to expect, but a lot of the analysis is exploratory, and my main job is helping canalize the knowledge that is available in the lab into making sense of the data. In this context, dotplots are our best friend, as it provides a very nice summary of gene expression over the whole (clustered) dataset. However, yesterday we noticed a confusing edge case: let’s say gene $g$ is expressed in the same number of cells in two clusters, 4 and 23. Cluster 4 has many, many more cells than 23, therefore on the dotplot it will look like $g$; is barely expressed in 4, but a great marker for 23. Of course, combining a dotplot with a feature plot helps you see that, but you get no sense of how many cells those are (more/less/the same). To alleviate this I am proposing an extension of dotplots: instead of circles, boxes, that have a height proportional to $log(#cells_{cluster})$, are filled proportionally to how many cells express gene $g$, and are colored according to the average expression. I think this works better than violinplots. Sadly I see no good way to multiplex this and plot multiple genes at once.

I'd propose to either use; ```; tmp=ad[ad.obs['louvain']=='subcluster_of_interest',:]; ad_sub=sc.AnnData(tmp.raw.X,obs=tmp.obs,var=tmp.raw.var); ```; to ""reset"" the `.X` matrix (maybe there's a better way?); or to make `sc.pp.highly_variable_genes` work on `ad.raw.X`. ```; scanpy==1.4.4 anndata==0.6.22.post1 umap==0.3.10 numpy==1.16.4 scipy==1.2.1 pandas==0.25.1 scikit-learn==0.20.3 statsmodels==0.10.1 python-igraph==0.7.1 louvain==0.6.1; ```
