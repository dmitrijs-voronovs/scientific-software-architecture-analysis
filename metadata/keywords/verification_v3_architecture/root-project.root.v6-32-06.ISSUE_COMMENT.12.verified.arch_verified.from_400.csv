Until then I guess I will try to build this in my windows. ; Thanks for replying to my queries.

",True,"The content discusses design decisions and potential architectural patterns within a software system.  \n\nSpecifically, it explores:  \n\n* **Error handling strategies:** The text analyzes different approaches to handling exceptions, comparing 'immediate exception' versus capturing and propagating errors through the call stack. This touches on a fundamental architectural concern – how to manage failures gracefully and provide meaningful error reporting. \n* **State management:** The discussion about 'global state' and the need for local knowledge highlights potential architectural issues related to data flow and control within the system. The proposed solution of injecting state using `RStatus` objects suggests an attempt to address this concern by introducing a more structured approach to state propagation. \n* **Code organization and dependencies:** The example call stack illustrates how different functions and modules interact, hinting at the overall system structure. The analysis of which function might be responsible for handling errors (`ROOT::ReadFromNetwork()`, `ROOT::RNetFile::Read()`, etc.) reveals insights into the intended design and dependencies between these components.  \n\nWhile the content focuses on a specific code example, the underlying discussion revolves around architectural choices and their impact on system behavior and maintainability."

Quality Attribute: Availability
Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: I know the question, but I don't think anyone knows the answer. The code that gets slowed down is vtable-heavy code (at least I think that's the symptom), i.e. ""legacy"" code. We need to motivate people to migrate to today's code, so that's what we should be optimize for. We are not making legacy code impossible, but we are indeed pessimizing it. I'd be happy :-) to have someone with `opt` knowledge figure out which pass it is that blows up. Maybe @hahnjo could give us a hand?

Availability,"I now understand what is going wrong: @Axel-Naumann pushed me into the right direction by noticing that the errors concern vtables and typeinfo symbols, which are subject to reemission on our side. Then our `WeakTypeinfoVTablePass` will mark them as `weak` to make sure the JIT infrastructure deduplicates the symbols as needed. Additionally, `ReuseExistingWeakSymbols` will entirely remove the definitions if the symbol can be found in the process, for example for compiled classes. Now the problem is that the symbols were originally marked as ""local to the shared library"" and relocations can take advantage of this.

Attribute Description: The system's readiness to perform its function when required, focusing on reliability and recovery. It involves fault masking or repair to prevent failures, ensuring minimal cumulative downtime.
Content: I now understand what is going wrong: @Axel-Naumann pushed me into the right direction by noticing that the errors concern vtables and typeinfo symbols, which are subject to reemission on our side. Then our `WeakTypeinfoVTablePass` will mark them as `weak` to make sure the JIT infrastructure deduplicates the symbols as needed. Additionally, `ReuseExistingWeakSymbols` will entirely remove the definitions if the symbol can be found in the process, for example for compiled classes. Now the problem is that the symbols were originally marked as ""local to the shared library"" and relocations can take advantage of this.

We could imagine to point at the documentation of the TFile constructor that explains what the integer passed to the `SetCompressionSettings` function means https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTFile.html#ad0377adf2f3d88da1a1f77256a140d60 and also at the doc of https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/structROOT_1_1RCompressionSetting.html which further explains the different compression algorithms available. Maybe as a side-note we could merge/align these two docs so one doesn't need to look for things in two places

This is ""filtered out"" later in `RooAbsArg::dependsOn` where `ignoreArg` is also `nullptr` and things magically work. So, @guitargeek, there are a number of possibilities:; 1. Modify the loop to only run until `std::min(_pdfList.size(), _coefList.size()`.; 2. Add explicit `nullptr` checks for `pdf` and `coef` before calling `observableOverlaps` so the compiler cannot optimize them out

Content: I used ""xtrace"", and I got messages printed when I use kAnyModifier, but none without it. ```; _root [1] 000:<:0549: 12: Request(102): ChangeKeyboardControl values={auto-repeat-mode=On(0x01)}; 000:>:0549: Event KeyPress(2) keycode=0x36 time=0x174cf013 root=0x00000185 event=0x07e000e7 child=None(0x00000000) root-x=939 root-y=542 event-x=54 event-y=38 state=Control,Mod2 same-screen=true(0x01); CTRL+C key pressed!; 0x7ffdd1322ea0 0 20; 000:>:0549: Event KeyRelease(3) keycode=0x36 time=0x174cf0b3 root=0x00000185 event=0x07e000e7 child=None(0x00000000) root-x=939 root-y=542 event-x=54 event-y=38 state=Control,Mod2 same-screen=true(0x01); 0x7ffdd1322ea0 1 20_; ```.

Even if CTRL is still trapped, pressing CTRL+S is detected as pressing just 'S' by X11, and then in HandleKey, doing event->fState & kKeyControlMask does detect correctly the mask. So fState seems to work, and the problem is just with XGrabKey and XUngrabKey sometimes not working in the release sequence I guess.

Content: IIUC a NullStmt would mean `if (true) {1;;}`. I'd prefer to keep value printing simple and instead invest where it's relevant: devtoolset, debug symbols, llvm upgrade (to llvm 11!), etc. This is a trade-off we should consciously do, and given that this is the first time I hear a request for value printing within nested blocks I'm not yet convinced that it's worth the effort (and yes, that's an additional counter argument). And I'm not just talking dev time but also long-term maintenance: more code, more clang interfaces used.

But in my real work I have to fit line shaped that are obtained from histograms and are different for every fit I do, so I do not know if an implementation of a custom PDF class is worth the effort if the Line Shape changes every time. Therefore I will probably just determine the shifts by ""try and error"" until my fits are alright. My main problem was the wrong normalization which does not happen in root 6.24.

",True,"The content discusses issues related to file handling and histogram sharing in a ROOT analysis context.

Content: Ok, applied your suggestions @guitargeek and also those of the DeepCode bot. Am now looking at the Travis results, but clang-tidy fails because it can't find the headers that are installed with the ZeroMQ builtin. I guess that makes sense, since they will only become available after they have been built/installed https://travis-ci.org/github/root-project/root/jobs/774177761.

This affects a couple of Cling tests and 3 ROOT tests: `roottest-cling-operator-runEqualTest`, `roottest-cling-template-separateDict-make`, and `roottest-cling-template-separateDictNamespace-make`.
