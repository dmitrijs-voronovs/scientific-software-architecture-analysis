2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.

5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided includes a build failure and failing tests, which are directly related to the testability of the software. A failed build indicates that some code may not be compiling correctly, potentially affecting test cases. The failing tests suggest that certain functionalities are not being validated as expected. This aligns with the concept of testability, which involves making sure that tests can effectively validate the system's functionality and detect faults.","

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided is a log snippet indicating that tests are failing. The quality attribute Testability refers to how easy it is to validate software functionality through testing. If tests are failing, this can indicate issues in testability, such as difficulty in controlling or observing the system's state during testing. Therefore, the content reflects aspects related to testability by showing failed tests which may point towards problems in how tests were designed or executed. However, the exact nature of the failure (e.g., specific error messages) would be more directly indicative of testability issues. The log itself is a true positive for testability as it relates to test outcomes that could affect this attribute.","

Content: Build failed on mac12arm/cxx20.; Running on 194.12.161.128:/Users/sftnight/build/workspace/root-pullrequests-build; [See console output](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/190142/console).; ### Failing tests:; - [projectroot.runtutorials.tutorial_v7_global_temperatures.cxx](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/190142/testReport/projectroot/runtutorials/tutorial_v7_global_temperatures_cxx/)

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content provided includes build failure information and test results which are directly related to testability as it pertains to the outcome of testing processes. This indicates that testing is failing, which ties into the quality attribute of Testability.","
You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Content: Build failed on mac12arm/cxx20.; Running on 194.12.161.128:/Users/sftnight/build/workspace/root-pullrequests-build; [See console output](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/190142/console).; ### Failing tests:; - [projectroot.runtutorials.tutorial_v7_global_temperatures.cxx](https://lcgapp-services.cern.ch/root-jenkins/job/root-pullrequests-build/190142/testReport/projectroot/runtutorials/tutorial_v7_global_temperatures_cxx/)
Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
",False,"The provided content focuses on a failed build process and failing tests within a specific software project (ROOT). It includes details about the environment, build location, failing test file paths, and links to console output and test reports. There is no mention of architectural patterns, decisions, quality attributes, system structure, or interactions, which are key indicators of software architecture discussions."
