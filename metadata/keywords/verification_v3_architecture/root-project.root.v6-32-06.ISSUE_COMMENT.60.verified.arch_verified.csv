I think this should take place at the call site, because it doesn't make sense for the other `interpolate6thDegree` usecase where no weird values are expected from logarithms. By the way, why is the interpolation taking place in logarithmic space instead of regular linear space and then transformed back into linear space after interpolation? Doesn't this also mean that the two interpolation schemes (FlexibleInterpVar and PiecewiseInterpolation) are again inconsistent? If the logarithm can be eliminated, I think we can do without introducing conditionals, no? That is, assuming the high and low vectors are filled sensibly, which is not checked anywhere as far as I can see, so that's still a minor weakness, but I guess that could easily be added in the documentation.

",True,"The content appears to be a list of file paths related to test reports and builds from Jenkins. These files are likely involved in testing processes within the software development lifecycle, specifically around root tests (root-test). Each path includes terms like 'roottest' and references to testing-related functions such as 'make', which is commonly used in build systems. The structure suggests that these files handle test cases or configurations for various aspects of the system, including tree formula, schema evolution, references, allocation, newdelete, and more. The presence of these test-related files indicates a focus on ensuring software functionality can be validated through testing processes, thereby aligning with the Testability quality attribute which focuses on ease of validation and fault detection.","

Quality Attribute: Testability
Attribute Description: The ease of validating software functionality through testing, enabling fault detection. This includes controlling and observing the system’s state, reducing complexity, and facilitating the creation of test cases and oracles.
Content: Draft because of open questions:; * In a separate header or move to `RPageStorage.hxx`?; * Class and namespace? I think we said `Internal`...; * More tests or other places this needs to be hooked up? I don't think we want a factory method to create an `RNTupleWriter` with a `RPageNullSink`, it's for internal testing only. Also, will conflict with https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14497

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content discusses code organization and testing setup concerns, such as where to place classes and whether to use factory methods for creating objects. These are related to testability because they deal with how easily software can be tested. Specifically, it mentions avoiding conflicts in testing environments by not exposing certain creation methods publicly. This relates to reducing complexity and facilitating test case creation, aligning with the quality attribute of Testability.","

Instructions: 
1. Analyze the content and the attribute description.
2. Determine if the content accurately reflects the intended quality attribute in this context.
3. If it does, label it as `true_positive: true`; if not, mark it as a `true_positive: false`.
4. If the content consists only of logs with no other text, mark it as a `true_positive: false`. 
4. If the content partially consists of logs, focus on analyzing remaining text. 
5. Add `reasoning` why the content is a true or false positive.
",True,"The content lists various test files and their paths, which are indicative of test cases and oracles used to validate functionality. This aligns with Testability as it involves controlling and observing the system's state through testing.","
You are an expert in software architecture and software engineering. You have the necessary expertise to evaluate whether a given piece of content is related to software architecture.

Evaluate whether the content explicitly discusses or relates to software architecture concepts, principles, or concerns. Your goal is to determine if the content is relevant to software architecture.

Instructions:

1. Analyze the content and determine whether it is discussing software architecture, including but not limited to:
    * Architectural patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, monolith, event-driven architecture).
    * Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or quality attributes (e.g., scalability, maintainability, performance).
    * High-level system structure, interactions, dependencies, or constraints.
2. If the content clearly pertains to software architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
3. If the content is general software development, code-level details, logs, or unrelated to architecture, mark it as `related_to_architecture: false`.
4. If the content includes partial architectural relevance but is mostly about implementation details, analyze whether the relevant part is strong enough to classify it as `related_to_architecture: true`.
5. Provide `related_to_architecture_reasoning` explaining why the content is classified as related on unrelated.
