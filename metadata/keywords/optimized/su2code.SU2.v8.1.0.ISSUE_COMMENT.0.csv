Availability," (should be your 3.7.8) and try `import pyamg` in the shell. If the ""No such file or directory"" error shows up, it means pyamg was not correctly installed; otherwise it is in fact installed. In the latter case, you can check if your python is configured to enable shared libraries. To do it, according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23201498/how-to-check-if-python3-was-built-with-enable-shared), in the python shell you can type ; `import sysconfig`; `sysconfig.get_config_vars('Py_ENABLE_SHARED')`; If the result is `[0]`, ie ""False"", you have to build python with the option `--enable-shared`. ; Now, I don't know how to do accomplish that with conda, but with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) it involves installing the desired python version with `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install <version>`. To recap, a ""workflow for newbies"" which appears to be working for me is. 1. install pyenv either from [source](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) or from your distibution repositories, if available. IMPORTANT: make sure the environment variables are correctly set and `pyenv init` is added to your shell, as per the installation instructions.; 2. install the desired python version (for example 3.7.8), enabling shared libraries: ; `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install 3.7.8`; 3. clone/download the [feature_adap](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/feature_adap) branch of SU2;; 4. in the SU2 folder, configure meson ; `./meson.py build` ; and make sure to update the environment variables in your `.bashrc` as indicated by meson's output.; 5. use ninja to build and install SU2 ; `./ninja -C build install`;; if you run into a permission error, specify an installation directory passing the `--prefix` option to meson, as explained [here](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2-installation/227676-su-installation-failed-due-insufficient-permissions.html).

In this case, I first downloaded the 'develop' branch to make sure everything is consitent with Pedro, and then I downloaded and replaced the 6 new committed files that related to the supersonic inlet profile development. The code should be totally the same at this point. And I did a flat plate test, which actually I need to fill a uniform profile, since the code would only generated an empty one.

Availability," revision e6e6e6b are very small, aside from an extra test file. But revision d1e3a18 fails the regression tests and revision e6e6e6b passes the regression tests. Specifically, it's only the CHT incompressible case that's failing. The test results show:. test_vals (stored): 0.000000, 0.000000, -7.685301, -12947.783696; sim_vals (computed): 0.000000, 0.000000, -7.685301, -12947.783678 ; delta_vals: 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000018. It's only the total heat flux that's different, and it's only off by 1E-7%. I believe that these changes are due to floating-point errors. To check and make sure nothing is going crazy, I ran the test case under both the develop and the PR branches. When I compared the solution files, I couldn't find any points where the solution differed by more than 0.0003%. The differences seem to be very small. The two differences between revision d1e3a18 and revision e6e6e6b can be summarized as follows:. 1. In the `CNumerics::GetViscousIncProjJacs()` calculation on the develop branch, a quantity called `theta` is calculated. `theta` is the magnitude of the `val_normal` parameter, squared. The catch is that `val_normal` is passed as a unit vector (named `UnitNormal` in `CAvgGradInc_Flow::ComputeResidual`). So `theta` should always be equal to one, with some floating point errors. In the failing revision, the value is set explicitly to one. In the passing revision, the magnitude is calculated explicitly. I checked, and the difference between `theta` and 1.0 is always of the order 1E-16 or less.; 2. The second change affects where the area is multiplied into the Jacobian. When the area is multiplied at a later stage, very small differences in the calculated quantities appear. I don't like revision e6e6e6b, and I would like to revert it. The question then is how to update the tests. We could just update the regression test values, but I would propose fixing the regression test. It seems to be sensitive to what I believe are unimportant differences.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/626#issuecomment-444655022:1509,error,errors,1509,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/626#issuecomment-444655022,1,['error'],['errors']
Availability," scheme for a multi-physics problem. To obtain the design accuracy in time, this implies that the loop over the number of time stages is outside the loop over the number of physical disciplines. Hence at a very high level in the hierarchy, the details of the time integration should then be known. The situation becomes even more complicated when one would like to employ time integration schemes that allow for time accurate local time stepping, e.g. the ones we are currently working on for the DG solver. I won't bore you with all the details here, but those schemes basically require the loop over the multiple disciplines to be between the predictor and corrector step, while both these steps consist of multiple stages. Although it is probably possible to come up with a data structure that supports all this, the question is whether this is desirable. Apart from the fact that it would require a major overhaul in the high level design of SU2, the implementation will be less readable, especially for people that will be starting with the code. Also the parallelization may become significantly more complicated. The alternative is that for unsteady multi-physics problems, we put the restriction that only single stage time integration schemes can be used, e.g. DT_STEPPING_1ST and DT_STEPPING_2ND. In that case, the details of the time integration scheme can be hidden at the driver level, where we then simply have a loop over the number of physical disciplines. The consequence of course is that more advanced time integration schemes will not be available for multi-physics problems. In the above I just tried to picture what, in my opinion, the consequences are for either option. I don't have a preference for one of them. The only thing I wanted to make clear is that it is not possible to hide all the details of the time integration scheme at the driver level, while also having support for all possible time integration schemes for an unsteady multi-physics problem.

Availability," the solution at the inlet corner is completely wrong, while the outlet is ok most likely because characteristics are outgoing as it is supersonic. The artifacts disappear if we disable MUSCL everywhere (1st order solution) or disable it only on boundaries (not ideal solution, but disabling only on corners would still be good enough for now I believe).

Availability," threads arrive to that routine. This also makes the routines safe to call in serial.; The only ""dangerous"" things to do in parallel are to: manage memory for a shared object (multiple threads call `new` but there is only one shared pointer on which to call `delete`); writing to the same memory locations concurrently.; I tried to make the first issue debugable by asserting that the initialization routines of CSysMatrix and CSysVector are only called by the master thread.; For the second issue I made the associated classes as const-correct as possible, that should at least make someone think twice before changing a member variable of those classes. The risk is still there for input variables as an algorithm development aspect... For example `MatrixVectorProductTransposed` cannot be made thread-parallel as simply/naively as its normal counterpart. ### Communication Model; The MPI + Threads communication model is very simple, currently only the master thread calls MPI routines (including `Error`), this requires thread barriers before and after the communication to make sure the correct values are passed and _seen_ by all threads.; We can test other alternatives in the future but at the moment this does not seem to be a significant bottleneck.; _Worksharing_ constructs have implicit barriers at completion, for CSysVector routines I used `nowait` modifiers, it is safe to call those routines in sequence since the loop sizes, and static work scheduling specifications are identical.; However, routines that access a CSysVector in a different way, should have an explicit barrier before using the vector (or risk having undefined behaviour). You will see these barriers on entry to matrix-vector product, and every `ComputeXXXPreconditioner` (if you don't, let me know xD). I think those routines are large enough to amortise the cost of this. ### Performance; Disclaimer:; - We are talking about linear solvers only, **you will not see a global improvement yet**.; - The large global ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/830#issuecomment-562646766:1782,Error,Error,1782,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/830#issuecomment-562646766,1,['Error'],['Error']

Availability," would likely perform better as it avoids the pesky gather/scatter operations.; Processing multiple geometric primitives can make full utilization of whatever register size (important on GPU's), the code is just as readable (as I hope to show), but gather/scatter cannot be avoided. ### Intro to SPMD; This one is simpler, in a nutshell multiple threads operate on the sub domain of an MPI rank.; The typical implementation has each thread executing a chunk of an edge or cell loop. **Why should we care about SPMD?**; Reduce the communication overhead resulting from domain decomposition and improve load balancing, important for strong scaling.; Some algorithms are more efficient that way, e.g. the ADT (as mentioned by Edwin), the current MG also seems to work better on fewer partitions, and additive versions of preconditioners like the ILU or LU-SGS lose effectiveness with number of partitions.; Optimum hardware utilization, for routines that are bandwidth-bound it may be beneficial to use all threads available, while for compute-bound or ""algorithm-bound"" ones this may not be the case. **Relation with algorithms**; A typical edge loop reads from 2 locations and writes to 2 locations (gather / scatter access pattern, not to be confused with the instructions) processing multiple edges at the same time can therefore result in race conditions where multiple threads try to update the data of the same point.; There are 3 ways to address this:; - **Coloring**: Edges are colored (grouped) such that edges of the same color have no risk of race conditions, i.e. each endpoint is referenced only once per color (this definition gives you the basis of a greedy algorithm to color edges).; - **Scatter to gather transformations**: Edge quantities (e.g. fluxes) are computed and stored on one pass (i.e. we read from 2 locations and write to 1), on a second pass, over points, we reduce (e.g. sum) the edge quantities for each point, again a gather access pattern.

Availability,"### Easter Egg - Mixed Precision; The work proposed above should have the solver run at the speed dictated by the available memory bandwidth (for implicit applications).; Keeping CSysMatrix in single precision, and solving the linear systems also in single precision, should therefore provide a good speedup (probably around 1.5 extra speedup).; Since all the flux computations would still be done in double precision no loss of accuracy would be incurred. However some stability can be lost on meshes with very high aspect ratios, therefore there would be a compile-time switch for this mode and the default would be all doubles (hence the Easter egg designation). This should be relatively easy to do cleanly since the relevant classes are already templated and have ""mixing-type logic"" for when they are used with AD. Except for central schemes, currently we would not gain much by doing it as residual loops are compute-bound and the linear solvers do not use that much time.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-549037701:114,avail,available,114,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-549037701,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"### Intro to SIMD; The ALU of modern CPU are capable of processing multiple elements of built-in types simultaneously by applying one instruction (e.g. add) to a register of those elements. Registers are at the very top of the memory hierarchy, for any computation to be performed data needs to be in registers.; An AVX register is 256 bits wide, that means 4 lanes of doubles or 8 of floats, AVX-512 (available in Xeon-Phi and SkylakeX processors) doubles the size. By GPU standards these are rookie numbers. **Why should we care about SIMD?**; Because it is the only way to use the whole silicon, by and large vector instructions have the same latency and throughput of their scalar versions, therefore speedups proportional to the number of SIMD lanes are possible in compute-bound code.; As we saw in #716 there is some of that in the numerics, do not expect 4x speed-ups though, low order unstructured FVM is known to be bandwidth-bound, vectorization helps a bit there too (instructions are also data that needs to travel to the CPU) (maybe for explicit schemes and 8 SIMD lanes, maybe). **Relation with data structures**; There is only one efficient way to move data between memory and registers, via `load` and `store` instructions (they do come in multiple flavors). That is, pointing to a memory location and reading or writing N elements of contiguous data.; It is not the only way, it is also possible to `gather` and `scatter` data. That is populating the register from non-contiguous locations and vice versa. This is about one order of magnitude slower, to the point where if the computations are very simple it may not pay-off to vectorize. **Relation with algorithms**; Some form of `gather` and `scatter` is required in unstructured CFD, which means SIMD has a price of admission. Some thought needs to go into designing algorithms that amortize that cost by maximizing the so called FLOP/Byte ratio, and mask the latency of those operations by being able to start computing as soon ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-529662724:402,avail,available,402,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-529662724,2,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"(I seem to have a knack to find cans of worms).; What I did in a55ca26 is not accurate, the integral of the fluid stress needs to be done in current coordinates and the normal available trough CVertex is in reference (undeformed) coordinates. I've implemented this in the structural solver as a preprocessing step. For each surface element of all FSI markers an average stress is computed based on its nodal values, it is then integrated in current (deformed) coordinates. A second pass over the elements scatters the force on the element to the nodes, this is to account for nodes that participate in multiple markers.; The mechanism by which the structural solver takes the flow tractions and updates the Residual vector was not changed, so this changes are fairly local.; The only downside I see is that knowledge of whether the interpolation is consistent or conservative is now required in two locations...

This is where the memory from the extra adjacency information is recovered. Like @economon said, fusing the gradient kernel with the limiter kernel is trivial with these point loops, and I do not think it affects readability much since one can clearly tell ""what is what"" (I will not put it here but it really is a matter of copy paste), including the boundaries could be a bit more challenging, but I will give performance number nevertheless. **Performance summary**. | Code | Edge | Edge, SIMD on vars | Point | Point, SIMD on points |; | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |; | **Speed 1 core** | 1.0 | 1.75 | 1.25 | 2.0 |; | **Speed 4 cores** | 2.45 | 2.7 | 4.5 | 7.0 |. The basic point version does not lose to edge based because, contrary to gradients, it does not require duplication of computations while benefiting from sequential access to gradients.; Again the point-based implementation does really well in parallel, limiters are more compute intensive and so the scaling is almost perfect.; For reference, limiters are 1.9 ti",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-530593912:9835,recover,recovered,9835,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-530593912,2,['recover'],['recovered']

Availability,", 2019, at 2:14 PM, Clark Pederson <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>> wrote:. I propose adding a unit-testing framework and unit-tests to SU2. After chatting with @economon<https://github.com/economon>, I've decided to move the discussion here to get additional input. What is unit testing?. For those not familiar with unit testing, unit testing allows the testing of small bits of behavior, ideally using isolated bits of code. It is not intended to replace validation testing or formal verification tests. Instead, it serves a unique purpose. Consider the three following use cases:. * You're developing a new feature, and you want to test it to see if it works. You could do a full simulation, but that takes a lot of time and computing power. You want to check if your new behavior behaves as you suspect before you throw a lot of resources at it.; * You submit a PR and discover that one of the regression tests has failed. But...why? You know that something is broken, but its hard to track down what broke. You want more granular test coverage that can demonstrate what broke.; * You are fixing a very small bug. You know that you should prove that your bug fix worked, but it doesn't seem logical to dedicate an entire validation case to one small bug fix. You want to write a small test for a small fix. In all of these cases, unit testing fills a unique role. Unit testing increases time spent in development, but decreases the amount of time spent in bug-fixing and maintaining. For more information, see this relevant Stack Exchange question.<https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/206/is-it-worthwhile-to-write-unit-tests-for-scientific-research-codes>. What do I propose?. My research group at UT Austing has implemented a unit testing framework on our branch, which we're happy with. Some choices were arbitrary, and some choices were made based on our development environment. Those choices may be different for other groups. Here's what we have done:.

The critical part of this error seems to be the Error in TokenizeString() message, suggesting an issue with parsing the configuration file. This error typically indicates a syntax problem, such as having multiple options on a single line without proper separation by an equal sign (=). However, upon reviewing _adap/ini/config_CFD.cfg_, was unable to find any lines that clearly violated this syntax rule. Could this error be indicative of a more subtle issue within the configuration file, or might it be related to specific aspects of the feature_adap branch? Any insights, suggestions, or guidance on how to troubleshoot this error would be greatly appreciated. If anyone has a working adapt_mesh.cfg file for a similar setup or for the feature_adap branch, I would be very interested in seeing it. Understanding the configuration details of a working example could be highly beneficial in resolving my issue.

Availability,"/how-to-check-if-python3-was-built-with-enable-shared), in the python shell you can type ; `import sysconfig`; `sysconfig.get_config_vars('Py_ENABLE_SHARED')`; If the result is `[0]`, ie ""False"", you have to build python with the option `--enable-shared`. ; Now, I don't know how to do accomplish that with conda, but with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) it involves installing the desired python version with `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install <version>`. To recap, a ""workflow for newbies"" which appears to be working for me is. 1. install pyenv either from [source](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) or from your distibution repositories, if available. IMPORTANT: make sure the environment variables are correctly set and `pyenv init` is added to your shell, as per the installation instructions.; 2. install the desired python version (for example 3.7.8), enabling shared libraries: ; `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install 3.7.8`; 3. clone/download the [feature_adap](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/feature_adap) branch of SU2;; 4. in the SU2 folder, configure meson ; `./meson.py build` ; and make sure to update the environment variables in your `.bashrc` as indicated by meson's output.; 5. use ninja to build and install SU2 ; `./ninja -C build install`;; if you run into a permission error, specify an installation directory passing the `--prefix` option to meson, as explained [here](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2-installation/227676-su-installation-failed-due-insufficient-permissions.html). These passages, at least for me, result in a running SU2 with mesh adaptation, although I have made no tests on running actual simulations. That being said, the involvement of pyenv is due to the fact that the provided python wheel for pyamg is for python 3.7 only. If I understand correctly, the library itself is proprietary, sadly, so I assume @bmunguia has access either to the source files or to someone who can package them.

In order to sort the points, a list mapping the old points to the new points (NewSort) is created. The problem is that this list is sorted by switching nodes. But it doesn't switch around the contents of the list (i.e. two node numbers from the list). Instead it switched an index from the list and an actual node number pulled from the geometry. This presents two problems:. 1. If any of the receive nodes actually are at the end of the list, they will get switched away from the end of the list.; 2. If any node is switched twice, data is lost. That's because the sorting assumes that the elements being switched have not already been switched. This is how the three points went missing from the cube problem I previously referenced. If my write-up is too confusing, I can provide a play-by-play of how the error occurs. —; You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.; Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/431#issuecomment-358340153>, or mute the thread<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AE_4SuB5X60MCplLjmFeVUIgSigM7xbrks5tLhH_gaJpZM4PE7sn>.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/431#issuecomment-358423989:2368,error,error,2368,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/431#issuecomment-358423989,1,['error'],['error']

We could also parallelize the matrix updates without colouring by setting only the off-diagonal coefficients and then setting the diagonal entries to the column sum.; It turns out that this is worse (by about 10%), maybe if the matrix were symmetric (row sum) but a column sum accesses blocks very far apart. Also we want to interleave compute and load/stores as much as possible to allow the CPU pipelining magic to mask the latency of the latter (even if it looks like you can only write the block after it is computed, CPU's have all kinds of buffers that allow the next loop iteration to begin while data is in flight). **Therefore colouring is the way to go.**. _Note: With vectorized numerics we insert blocks for 4 or 8 edges into the matrix at a time, the data for those inserts will be in a slightly weird format, which will make `SparseMatrix::updateBlocks` a bit harder on the eye, more on that later._. ## MUSCL Reconstruction; The MUSCL reconstruction, characteristic of upwind schemes, is the simplest building block to show the (negative) implications of storing the data as structures of arrays (SoA) on the performance of some operations.; Here is the most basic numerics you can think of, reconstruct and average (the dummy matrix loop was to benchmark the writes this is to benchmark the reads); ```c++; void computeResidual(size_t nVar,; size_t nDim,; const vector<size_t>& colorStart,; const vector<size_t>& edgeIdx,; const vector<pair<size_t,si",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-535977206:5090,mask,mask,5090,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-535977206,2,['mask'],['mask']

Availability,"> ; > ; > Dear Daumantas,; > ; > I appreciate your effort in adding support for cmake in SU2. We have recently introduced the Meson build system (https://mesonbuild.com/) (#685, #745) as a candidate to replace automake. A guide on how to use can be found [here](https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Build-SU2-From-Source/). The idea is that we will have this system along automake at least for the upcoming version 7 and that we get rid of automake afterwards. Considering that, I don't think that it makes sense to maintain 3 different build systems **at the moment**. I really hate turning contributions down, but this one is three months too late. However, we might reconsider adding support for another build system once we got rid of automake, or, if we feel that meson does not fit our needs.; > ; > I am all ears to hear other opinions. However, let's not start a discussion on the advantages/disadvantages of the build systems. Some benefits can be found in the Issue/PR linked above. Ok, I tried meson with MinGW but couldn't figure out how to link with MSMPI since it's not a part of MinGW. However, using CMake and with a few source code fixes, I managed to compile nearly every configuration with MSVC. Surprisingly, there were very few errors in SU2. The externals only had a few preprocessor issues. At the moment only MeDiPack fails to compile with MSVC but not with MinGW even though the MPI headers are the same so I suspect it's an issue with MSVC itself, I'm using the latest preview version.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814#issuecomment-553571450:603,down,down,603,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814#issuecomment-553571450,4,"['down', 'error']","['down', 'errors']"

Availability,"> @kursatyurt Hello, thank you so much for the lead.; > ; > Our initial scope mostly involved writing our own kernels and I did explore some libraries at the start - I was planning on using CUSP as well but my main concern was its lack of being updated to the newly compatible versions of the toolkit. cuSolver and cuBLAS do exist, but I chose to go ahead with a ""simple"" kernel implementation to have more control. I also felt that if I could keep the block size of the grid in optimal territory then they could be just as fast as those options (please do correct me if my reading of the literature or the situation was incorrect). To learn the basics, it's a good idea, but for large-scale projects, I prefer using existing libraries if possible.; Those libraries generally exploit state-of-the-art solution like mixed-precision computing. A gaming GPU is not way faster than a good CPU in double precision, but way faster in single precision, most of them have 64:1 ratio, however server class GPU have 2:1 ratio. Also when available they use vendor libraries like cuBLAS or hipBLAS. It is always nice to have you only care about connection and somebody else handle the solver as performant as possible. In future probably they will provide more and more solvers and it will be automagically works.

Availability,"> Do I understand correctly that two gradients are always computed per iteration?; > Is there any downside to using the unweighted LS for viscous flux correction? Is the statement that this type of gradient is better for reconstruction based on your observations or is it one of those well known things?. Yes - the gradient for now is computed twice and stored separately for viscous flows with 2nd-order upwind. Could be combined into one loop eventually. It is known that weighted LSQ / GG is more accurate (see Mavriplis, ""Revisiting the Least-Squares Procedure for Gradient Reconstruction on Unstructured Meshes"" for instance). However, unweighted LSQ is known to be more robust.. so a good compromise is to use it only for the reconstruction step (which is more susceptible to robustness issues than the viscous term) and then use WLSQ or GG for all other gradients in the viscous flux/sources for accuracy. > Sometimes high CFL leads to limit-cycle oscillations of the residuals and the solution is to reduce it, is this something this controller can pick up?; > High CFL also makes the linear systems harder to solve and as Edwin pointed out _somewhere_ there is not much point going above reasonable values with weakly coupled turbulence.

So if the the option `ITER_DCL_DALPHA = 0` then it will do exactly what you suggest. It calculates the derivative based on the last update. The only problem with that is, there is no guarantee that the simulation at the previous update was converged, so the derivative might be incorrect. .

So if there's any questions, feel free to ping me. Thank you for your reply, in fact there still exists some question.; Because in the code for calculating viscous Jacobians, I did not find any partial derivative of primitive variables.; In the stress tensor, partial derivatives such as ∂u/∂x_i, ∂ρ/∂x_i (GradPrimVar[iVar][iDim]) are part of the expression of tau[iDim][jDim], which affects the value of Proj_Flux_Tensor[iVar].; In the approximate process of the Jacobian matrix, it seems that the originally expected terms such as ∂(u/ρ)/∂x are replaced by values like val_Mean_PrimVar[jDim+1]/(Density*val_dist_ij), and then used as part of Jacobian_i and Jacobian_j's expression.; I thought there should be some differential terms, but I didn't find it.; So my question is to know more details about the approximation in calculating viscous Jacobians.; I mention this problem because I want to add some equations (such as concentration equations, moment distribution equations) based on SU2's NS solver, develop an implicit solver, and solve adjoint problems. So augmented Jacobian matrices are needed. I have gone through the SU2 code of TNE2Solver in version 4.0.1.

While I also generally wouldn't want to rely on file I/O, my issues with how we had it were ; 1) if the final CFL of the primal solver was large then even adapting in the dry run would have a much lower CFL, which resulted in super slow adjoint convergence making it a huge (or at least more than necessary) bottleneck in optimization/mesh adaptation; 2) sometimes I would get divergence when adapting in the dry run even with converged primal solutions.

Availability,"> In the early days, we thought completely removing CVariable and CNumerics would be very intrusive to change and would hurt flexibility... Over the years, I don't think that folks have really modified the CNumerics classes all that often (once you have implemented the Roe method, it is more or less done). As someone who has worked with the CNumerics classes a lot, I can say that we really don't gain much by keeping them as separate classes. On the surface, it seems like a good use of the [strategy pattern](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/strategy). But from a pragmatic approach, it's not as flexible as OO purists would like you to believe. First off, if you need a new variable in the CNumerics class, you need to change both the solver class and the numerics class, since the solver class calls Setters to set the numerics variables. If you don't call the right Setters, you get a silent failure (unless you're using valgrind). The passing of variables between solver and numerics also leads to a lot of code duplication. And for many solvers (e.g. the viscous NS numerics or the source terms in the SST model) you only end up with one numerics class anyways. I also imagine there's a strong performance hit from all the Setters and copying of variables. But I haven't taken the time to check for myself. In my opinion, you could keep 80% of the current flexibility by using different functions instead of different classes.

Availability,"> SU2 is a fantastic library, but the build process is really painful to get static linking within another C++ program. CMake is a standard for building C++ projects and would be extremely helpful. Ideally Python wouldn't be necessary to build SU2 or link it with another project. I'm not sure I understand this... the fact that the build system uses python means that it is really painful to configure the build system to emit a static library? (This should absolutely not be the case! Meson has a core option `-Ddefault_library={static|shared|both}` to select what kind of library you want to build, for any library whose build description claims it can support either one. It's a bit like cmake's `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS` except much more powerful.). However, as far as I can tell, su2 doesn't mark any of its libraries as public at all (i.e., installable) so maybe that's a moot point. As far as making python be necessary to build the project, I think this mainly boils down to ""I myself use cmake, I have cmake installed, I don't want to install another program when I could use the program I already have"". Is it really that big of a deal, though? The software *does* use it, and it's not that difficult to install TBH (Linux operating systems in particular almost certainly have it installed already).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1711#issuecomment-1312985406:972,down,down,972,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1711#issuecomment-1312985406,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"> There are 2 cases in the testcases repository, both are using the Euler solver. Maybe also check if your case is running correctly with the settings from those testcases. Earlier, I was defining the mesh movement for the static zone as:. ` GRID_MOVEMENT= NONE `. since it was stationary. However, after checking the test cases, I found that the stator zones should also be defined as moving as. ```; GRID_MOVEMENT= RIGID_MOTION; MOTION_ORIGIN= 0.0 0.0 0.0; ROTATION_RATE = 0.0 0.0 0.0 ; ```. even though the mesh stays stationary. In that case, the unphysical flow results I presented earlier vanished. Earlier, I tried the cylinder test case with the inner zone having . ```; GRID_MOVEMENT= RIGID_MOTION; MOTION_ORIGIN= 0.0 0.0 0.0; ROTATION_RATE = 0.0 0.0 0.0; ```. and the outer zone having; ` GRID_MOVEMENT= NONE `. where the simulation gave physically viable results. I guess the zone interface may not accurately work if the `GRID_MOVEMENT` options of the neighbouring zones do not match while one of the zones has a non-zero movement. However, I have not simulated any other test cases. Also, the sliding_interface/rotating_cylinders test case diverges with the given .cfg files. At around the 775th time step, I received the following error message:. `SU2 has diverged (Residual > 10^20 detected). `.

The discussions you mention sound very promising, I would be glad to join tomorrow afternoon and learn more, so that I might contribute. One quick remark: I am aware that it is indeed possible to deform the mesh within `SU2_CFD`, I use this extensively for static aero-elastic analysis. However, I have not been able to have the deformed mesh be written to file at output (in SU2 or CGNS format). This is fine for aero-elastic updates (movement of the surface due to _structural displacements_), where it is sufficient to see the deformed mesh in the post-processing files. It becomes impractical though, for design updates (movement of the surface to due to _design displacements_, i.e. representing changes in the design variables) where the new mesh is a useful intermediate result. Even if this is just an issue in my configuration file, I think that a stand-alone driver or equivalent of `SU2_DEF` would remain useful. For each new set of updated design variables during shape optimisation, a single mesh deformation is sufficient to provide the new, updated jig geometry which all of the aerodynamic or aero-elastic analyses (one for each oper",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1262#issuecomment-818839696:396,avail,available,396,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1262#issuecomment-818839696,2,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"@EduardoMolina : Nice results! Thanks for the comments. You are seeing more warnings bc I did in fact change the tolerance that controls the warning. But, note that this tolerance only controls when to print the warnings, so the matches should have still be the same (nearest neighbor after transformation). . The reason is that the new implementation assumes a 1-to-1 matching of the nodes and surface elements on either side of the periodic face. To be consistent, the points/faces on either side should match exactly so that they can be summed into a complete dual control volume (this assumption is made in the implementation and the partial residuals are summed as such). Nice catch on the fem_solver check. I will add that to the conditional. Thanks for the review @rsanfer. I will submit the final version shortly and if the tests pass, I would propose we merge this one first, if alright with @pcarruscag (the reason being that I would likely need your help to update the implementation for templating in the end anyway :) ).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/652#issuecomment-485930910:113,toler,tolerance,113,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/652#issuecomment-485930910,2,['toler'],['tolerance']

Availability,"@WallyMaier thank you. Interesting... 1. This reference reminded me to add the contribution of the turbulence kinetic energy (+2/3 v rho k) in the energy equation source (see page 10 equation 2.30, pdf page 37), so that's done. 2. This reference will be helpful If I get to do the axysimmetry source terms for k and omega (by comparing equations 2.31 and 2.31 to equations B.2 and B.3) but that will be in a separate PR. In fact I am getting good results for RANS already (although no time for a thorough validation). 3. In that reference they have also done what I did before and pulled out the primitive derivatives and neglected the viscosity gradient and then came up with the same axisymmetry momentum source terms so that is comforting. However, their energy source terms are different and that made me think. What we have now is according to the first reference, so it should be fine unless there is an error in it. I find it suspicious that both aux derivatives are wrt y and none wrt x given the that we have one wrt x and one wrt y in the momentum equation...

Availability,"@economon, from the config files in the V&V folder, it seems like you ran without adaptive CFL and without the unweighted LSQ. The main difference between the V&V runs and these ones is that I don't use any slope limiter. In the V&V cases the `SLOPE_LIMITER_TURB= VENKATAKRISHNAN` option was used. . There are some other differences: ; 1. I use adaptive CFL; 2. I use `REF_DIMENSIONALIZATION= FREESTREAM_PRESS_EQ_ONE`; 3. Linear solver settings are slightly different. For the V&V runs the following are used: ; ```; % Minimum error of the linear solver for implicit formulations; LINEAR_SOLVER_ERROR= 1E-15; %; % Max number of iterations of the linear solver for the implicit formulation; LINEAR_SOLVER_ITER= 25; ```; For my runs, I used the settings you had suggested in #790 : ; ```; % Minimum error of the linear solver for implicit formulations; LINEAR_SOLVER_ERROR= 1E-10; %; % Max number of iterations of the linear solver for the implicit formulation; LINEAR_SOLVER_ITER= 10; ```; 4. For the SST runs, I did not specify these options that you used in the V&V case: ; ```; % Free-stream turbulence intensity for the SST model; < FREESTREAM_TURBULENCEINTENSITY = 0.00038729; < %; < % Free-strem turbulence to laminar viscosity ratio for the SST model; < FREESTREAM_TURB2LAMVISCRATIO = 0.009; ```; I have attached the config files I used.

The second is that sometimes it takes too long to download the test cases, so I have added the keywords 'travis_wait 90' in the call to the entire python script in .travis.yml in order to extend the 10 minute restriction to 90 min.

Availability,"@jayantmukho LGTM. I'm also in favor of moving to SST-2003 if it means a more robust SST solver. This might also be a good time to continue to look into other issues with SST, e.g. some TKE terms mentioned in #797. Another possible discrepancy I noticed is that in CTurbSSTVariable we have; ```; CDkw(iPoint) = 0.0;; for (unsigned long iDim = 0; iDim < nDim; iDim++); CDkw(iPoint) += Gradient(iPoint,0,iDim)*Gradient(iPoint,1,iDim);; CDkw(iPoint) *= 2.0*val_density*sigma_om2/Solution(iPoint,1);; CDkw(iPoint) = max(CDkw(iPoint), pow(10.0, -20.0));; ...; arg1 = min(arg2, 4.0*val_density*sigma_om2*Solution(iPoint,0) / (CDkw(iPoint)*val_dist*val_dist+EPS*EPS));; F1(iPoint) = tanh(pow(arg1, 4.0));; ```; which is consistent with TMR, but when computing the cross diffusion residual we have; ```; val_residual[1] += (1.0 - F1_i)*CDkw_i*Volume;; ```; However, here TMR (as well as both SST-1993 and SST-2003) has; <img width=""162"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-03-06 at 4 44 14 PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19416354/76132834-cff18a80-5fc9-11ea-9a72-8e4ab524e8dc.png"">; So to be consistent with TMR, would it make more sense to have e.g.; ```; CDkw(iPoint) = 0.0;; for (unsigned long iDim = 0; iDim < nDim; iDim++); CDkw(iPoint) += Gradient(iPoint,0,iDim)*Gradient(iPoint,1,iDim);; CDkw(iPoint) *= 2.0*val_density*sigma_om2/Solution(iPoint,1);; ...; arg1 = min(arg2, 4.0*val_density*sigma_om2*Solution(iPoint,0) / (max(CDkw(iPoint),pow(10.0,-10.0))*val_dist*val_dist+EPS*EPS));; F1(iPoint) = tanh(pow(arg1, 4.0));; ```; so we don't clip the cross diffusion residual?

Availability,"@pcarruscag, I agree with you it will be hard to beat the MKL (running at 60 percent peak for most of the gemm calls for the DG-solver), but if you don't have any performance loss, that would already be nice, as it improves readability. Furthermore, the performance of the DG solver in combination with the discrete adjoint is horrible, because it relies on my very naive implementation of the matrix products. So it would already be something if we can get an improvement there, although we do not use the DG adjoint solver (yet). . For me the easiest way to test things out for the DG-solver would actually be in SU2 itself. @economon put some nice profiling routines in there for the gemm calls, which can be used without any additional work to test eigen. @pcarruscag (or somebody else), could you create a branch in which eigen is downloaded in the external directory? I think I can manage from there. Thanks,.

Availability,"@pcarruscag: the approach to use different gradient methods for the convective and viscous terms is relatively common across codes. If it is a computational cost concern, this can be addressed by fusing the kernels. . However, the bigger issue at hand is the other comment that is made in the article about the choice between LSQ and WLSQ/GG for 2nd-order upwind reconstructions: while less accurate, the former is much more robust, while the latter two usually require limiters just to obtain a stable solution on stretched RANS-type meshes, even for flows where we do not expect shocks/discontinuities. The problem with always requiring a limiter is that they stall convergence due to chatter, which apart from the obvious problems, also causes issues for the adjoint. I think everyone has experienced this. Hence the compromise to use both gradients as I note above, which is also stated on p. 9 of Anderson and Bonhaus ""An Implicit Upwind Algorithm for Computing Turbulent Flows on Unstructured Grids."" In that paper they mention an additional interesting point that, in their numerical tests, LSQ outperforms WLSQ/GG for reconstructing nonlinear data at interfaces on highly-stretched meshes. Note the WLSQ/GG gradients are used for the viscous terms, which is important for accuracy. This type of approach is still applied in FUN3D. . If there are any accuracy concerns, we can also address those via our typical verification tools. I agree that we should continue along the path of looking at grid quality issues and how they impact the numerics (potentially adding some grid-based corrections / limiting), but I think the proposed approach in this PR will serve us well.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790#issuecomment-532883592:425,robust,robust,425,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790#issuecomment-532883592,1,['robust'],['robust']

Availability,"@talbring Thanks. That second link is very informative. I think that SU2 could really use a more advanced build process, and meson seems like a good candidate. As an example of why I think SU2 needs a better build process: Right now for AD builds, the build process listed in the tutorial asks you to use the `preconfigure.py` script to download and update the codi and medi git submodules. But there's a couple problems with the preconfigure script. It doesn't support out-of-source builds, and it expects all configure arguments to come in ""option=value"" pairs.

Availability,"@timjim333 it could be an issue with shared libraries, which ultimately is a path issue, as you suspected.; To verify it try opening a python shell, checking the version displayed (should be your 3.7.8) and try `import pyamg` in the shell. If the ""No such file or directory"" error shows up, it means pyamg was not correctly installed; otherwise it is in fact installed. In the latter case, you can check if your python is configured to enable shared libraries. To do it, according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23201498/how-to-check-if-python3-was-built-with-enable-shared), in the python shell you can type ; `import sysconfig`; `sysconfig.get_config_vars('Py_ENABLE_SHARED')`; If the result is `[0]`, ie ""False"", you have to build python with the option `--enable-shared`. ; Now, I don't know how to do accomplish that with conda, but with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) it involves installing the desired python version with `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install <version>`. To recap, a ""workflow for newbies"" which appears to be working for me is. 1. install pyenv either from [source](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) or from your distibution repositories, if available. IMPORTANT: make sure the environment variables are correctly set and `pyenv init` is added to your shell, as per the installation instructions.; 2. install the desired python version (for example 3.7.8), enabling shared libraries: ; `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install 3.7.8`; 3. clone/download the [feature_adap](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/feature_adap) branch of SU2;; 4. in the SU2 folder, configure meson ; `./meson.py build` ; and make sure to update the environment variables in your `.bashrc` as indicated by meson's output.; 5. use ninja to build and install SU2 ; `./ninja -C build install`;; if you run into a permission error, specify an installation directory passing the `--prefix` option to meson, as explained [here](https://www.cfd-online.com/Fo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/948#issuecomment-751823130:275,error,error,275,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/948#issuecomment-751823130,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"Agreed that it is a bit different... . I would add one practical comment for consideration: it is worth checking whether the main restriction we have is related to approximations in the Jacobian that limit the effective CFL we can use or whether the convergence of the linear solver itself is a problem (speed or complete lack of convergence). A quick test without resorting to another library is to increase the fill-in for ILU-preconditioned GMRES, which is very expensive/slow but should converge difficult problems, and to check how high we can take the CFL when allowing each nonlinear iteration to converge to a tight tolerance in the linear solver, say 1e-14 (you can output the linear solver residuals to verify convergence). If we can take the CFL higher with a more performant linear solver, then it could be worth the effort to try other options. If the CFL must remain low for stability, then perhaps we should look at the quality of the Jacobians we construct to see if we can improve, or even try exact Jacobians with AD if we can afford it. A more advanced CFL ramping strategy could also be helpful here to get us closer to a solution before trying to aggressively converge.

I'll get the chance to jump into this topic which I'm interested in.; As some of you know I'm currently working on sliding meshes and multi-zone problems for turbo-machinery applications.; Currently also the cinterpolator class, in particular for the nearest neighbour interpolation, relies on brute force search algorithms. ; Moreover, a lot of possible (future) interpolation methods may rely on a nearest neighbour search in the very first place (I'm thinking for instance to the construction of a polynomial interpolation pattern which would require to find a bunch of donor points on the donor mesh); This may lead to a dramatic increase of the computational time when dealing with very large problems like for instance unsteady multi-stage turbo-machinery problems, since, for these particular applications, at every time step we will need to reconstruct the communication pattern among rotors and stators.; So the implementation of a clever way to carry out the nearest neighbour search will be mandatory in the future of SU2. I think that it would be very useful to have a reliable and reusable tree search library so that everyone can exploit the same function calls.; For former works I did use the ANN library from the University of Maryland which is distributed under the GNU lesser public license, moreover I talked with Edwin and he also has some routines he wrote himself that could suits this particular problem.

Furthermore, the performance of the DG solver in combination with the discrete adjoint is horrible, because it relies on my very naive implementation of the matrix products. So it would already be something if we can get an improvement there, although we do not use the DG adjoint solver (yet). For me the easiest way to test things out for the DG-solver would actually be in SU2 itself. @economon<https://github.com/economon> put some nice profiling routines in there for the gemm calls, which can be used without any additional work to test eigen. @pcarruscag<https://github.com/pcarruscag> (or somebody else), could you create a branch in which eigen is downloaded in the external directory?

The differences between revision d1e3a18 and revision e6e6e6b are very small, aside from an extra test file. But revision d1e3a18 fails the regression tests and revision e6e6e6b passes the regression tests. Specifically, it's only the CHT incompressible case that's failing. The test results show:. test_vals (stored): 0.000000, 0.000000, -7.685301, -12947.783696; sim_vals (computed): 0.000000, 0.000000, -7.685301, -12947.783678 ; delta_vals: 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000018. It's only the total heat flux that's different, and it's only off by 1E-7%. I believe that these changes are due to floating-point errors. To check and make sure nothing is going crazy, I ran the test case under both the develop and the PR branches. When I compared the solution files, I couldn't find any points where the solution differed by more than 0.0003%. The differences seem to be very small. The two differences between revision d1e3a18 and revision e6e6e6b can be summarized as follows:. 1. In the `CNumerics::GetViscousIncProjJacs()` calculation on the develop branch, a quantity called `theta` is calculated. `theta` is the magnitude of the `val_normal` parameter, squared. The catch is that `val_normal` is passed as a unit vector (named `UnitNormal` in `CAvgGradInc_Flow::ComputeResidual`). So `theta` should always be equal to one, with some floating point errors. In the failing revision, the value is set explicitly to one. In the passing revision, the magnitude is calculated explicitly. I checked, and the difference between `theta` and 1.0 is always of the order 1E-16 or less.; 2. The second change affects where the area is multiplied into the Jacobian. When the area is multiplied at a later stage, very small differences in the calculated quantities appear. I don't like revision e6e6e6b, and I would like to revert it.

Availability,"As we mentioned in the dev meeting where you exposed the problem, the implementation is not good for strongly coupled flows, and I would guess that it is worse for diffusion than convection (because diffusion is elliptic).; I suspect the main problem is that the linear system does not contain information from the other side of the interface, meaning the solution of the two domains is effectively decoupled.; You could try running the case at much lower CFL (below 1) even with an explicit method.; It is also possible that the current treatment could be improved, since it is an example of multiplicative Schwartz decomposition, maybe there is an ""optimal"" way of implementing that from a physics point of view. Just speculating here, but maybe it would help treating the interface as an outlet if flow is going out, and as an inlet if flow is coming in.; On the numerics side, you can also try hacking the MZ driver to use something more stable than block-Gauss-Seidel (e.g. some quasi-Newton thing for the interface). But those are all band-aids IMO, if you want a robust fluid-fluid interface you need the coupling to be present in the linear system.

Availability,"Dear @vdweide,. I do see your point as well, in fact I remember that I raised my concerns about this when the multi-physics driver started to be used for multi-zone, single physics problems. Unfortunately, moving down the loop in the zones would break the FSI solver, and also the FSI coupled adjoint solver that we have put together, so I have to advise otherwise. . When we first put together the Driver structure, the objective was to be able to fully converge different physical problems independently from each other. Then, the level of abstraction of the classes we implemented permitted for the structure to be used in fluid-fluid problems. CFD is not my top expertise, so the details escape to me, but it always seemed to me more natural to have an upper loop on the physics (the driver loop), and then have an internal loop over fluid zones. . That is pretty much the same idea as @salvovitale is proposing: keeping the Driver as is, for different physics, and incorporate inside the Iteration the loop over different zones in the fluid domain. This structure would address problems like Salvatore's example of multi-stage turbomachinery. Let's see what others think of this, happy to have a chat or a telecom over this. Kind regards,.

Availability,"Dear Daumantas,. I appreciate your effort in adding support for cmake in SU2. We have recently introduced the Meson build system (https://mesonbuild.com/) (#685, #745) as a candidate to replace automake. A guide on how to use can be found [here](https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Build-SU2-From-Source/). The idea is that we will have this system along automake at least for the upcoming version 7 and that we get rid of automake afterwards. Considering that, I don't think that it makes sense to maintain 3 different build systems **at the moment**. I really hate turning contributions down, but this one is three months too late. However, we might reconsider adding support for another build system once we got rid of automake, or, if we feel that meson does not fit our needs. I am all ears to hear other opinions.

Availability,"Dear SU2 users,. I continued the investigation and managed to track down the source of the problem.; The issues I face with SU2 appear when my wing geometry has several airfoils across the span. I ran several cases with supercritical airfoils and NACA 4 digits airfoils. As soon as the airfoil was changing along the span, SU2 had troubles computing the projected and wetted area of the wing, an attaining a correct solution. To better illustrate the issue, I attached a SU2 .cfg file (dummy.txt) and Gmsh .geo file (dummy_mesh.txt) to this post.; The geometry is the same as in the previous post except that I used 3 different airfoils along the span. That is, I replaced the NASA SC(2)-0712 by the {NASA SC(2)-0714, NASA SC(2)-0712, NASA SC(3)-0712}.; These airfoils are similar, so I expected to recover similar results. However, I observed that:; - SU2 computed the wrong z-projected area : 23.1 m^2 instead of 38 m^2,; - the y+ of the first cell is way too high in certain regions (see attached image, grey zones are the area where y+<1),; - the Cp distribution if not looking good (makes sense with those values of y+), see attached file. I am unsure if the problem appears because Gmsh has trouble in generating this kind of mesh or because SU2 has trouble reading it. Any ideas are welcome.

Availability,"First of all, thanks @bmunguia for picking this up.. I ran out of time when we were wrapping up v7, so the approach to check for stalling residuals within the CFL adaption routine was half-baked at best. It can definitely be improved (I'm not happy that I left some magic numbers hard-coded in there!). The implementation that is there to check for stall was very loosely based on the type of check we use for computing the Cauchy criteria (accumulated residual changes over time), but we should consider different approaches altogether. Btw, the original CFL adaption routine used something close to Switched Evolution Relaxation, while the new strategy is Exponential Progression with Under-relaxation (see ""A Robust Adaptive Solution Strategy for High-Order Implicit CFD Solvers,"" AIAA 2011-3696 for a short description of both). As you also guessed, I had wanted to experiment with separate CFL numbers for flow and turbulence but also did not get to it. In the end, as @pcarruscag says, this is a very empirical task. It will be difficult to nail down a perfect configuration for all problems, but we might be able to come up with some best practices for choosing tunable parameters if folks have the time to run a lot of numerical experiments for a range of cases to see what works best.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1036#issuecomment-653182720:712,Robust,Robust,712,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1036#issuecomment-653182720,2,"['Robust', 'down']","['Robust', 'down']"
Availability,"First off, I love the changes. A cleanup of COuput and greater output flexibility were much needed. So let me see if I understand this code. Say that I, as a developer, want to add a new variable to the volume output. For example, I want the production of turbulent kinetic energy from the SST model during a compressible simulation. As a user, I can always add new outputs by adding new field names to the config file. But production isn't one of the (currently) available config-file options. So I would have to code it. First, I would obviously make sure that the production is properly stored in the turbulence variable class, with an accessor like `GetTurbProduction()`. Second, in `CFlowCompOutput::LoadVolumeData`, I would add to the appropriate place:. ```cpp; SetVolumeOutputValue(""PRODUCTION"", iPoint, Node_Turb->GetTurbProduction());; ```. Third, I would add `PRODUCTION` as a cfg input by adding the following line to `CFlowCompOutput::SetVolumeOutputFields`:. ```cpp; AddVolumeOutput(""PRODUCTION"", ""Turb_Production"", ""PRIMITVE""); ```. I could also split off production into its own output group by changing `PRIMITVE` to any other name. This name does not have to be registered anywhere else. In other words, I can change `PRIMITVE` to `SST_NUMERICS` and the only other place I need to put `SST_NUMERICS` is my cfg file. Finally, I could add either of the two following lines to my cfg file:; ```; VOLUME_OUTPUT= (COORDINATES, SOLUTION, PRODUCTION) ; VOLUME_OUTPUT= (COORDINATES, SOLUTION, SST_NUMERICS); ``` . Is this example correct? If not, what am I misunderstanding?

Availability,"Folks,. This is indeed a very important capability for many different applications: from interpolation of solutions from coarser grids to finer grids, to querying an unsteady solution, to implementing numerical error estimates…and many others. It is important that the search / interpolation routines work when interpolating between grids where some points in the target grid may fall outside of the source grid and, therefore some notion of distance to the wall is needed. Fortunately, Edwin van der Weide had worked on an interpolation library that @sravya91 (who received her PhD yesterday at our graduation ceremony and is now working at NVIDIA) used in her work. Jayant Mukhopadhaya and Brian Munguia have also been testing/improving the library. Perhaps everyone can comment on current status and we can create a small task force to see what still needs to be done and who can do what?. Best,. Juan.

Availability,"Following this discussion, I want to share certain points related to convergence -. 1- Some good/fast solution initialisation methods will be helpful to start with (commercial solver like Fluent uses Full Multigrid initialisation /FMG - euler initialisation, which provides fast initial guess to start with). 2- Switching from first order to second order gradually will be helpful. 3- Smart/tuned CFL ramping strategy (some commercial codes have tuned way of doing it where CFL range varies from subsonic to hypersonic Mach number). 4- As Dr. Economon mentioned exact Jacobians play important role (In SU2 code, HLLC, JST and Roe have exact/nearly exact Jacobians). I observed that with inconsistent discretization (with some of the problems), solution does not go with higher CFL even in later stages and takes more iterations to converge. 5- It will be desirable to arrive at fewer set/combination of Linear solver+preconditioner which covers broad range of problems. That will help in faster evolution of solution convergence strategies . 6- Handling poor quality cells in some way may be important from practical usage point of view with realistic geometries (I don’t know how much literature is available for such stuff).

The interface there is a no-slip wall with the CHT_WALL_INTERFACE type. The downstream surface is also no-slip, but it is a typical ISOTHERMAL wall. Since the CHT_WALL_INTERFACE type was not considered earlier (only the trailing no-slip wall), I think that you will see a reduced wall distance near the cylinder, which will impact the turbulent solution.

Availability,"Great progress, thanks @clarkpede !. As for your notes, some thoughts:; - I think you are already doing this but just in case... manually specifying the info at each node can be made a little easier by automatically generating the files for the first time if they don't exist at runtime. We had code that would do this for the grid motion case, and perhaps you can reuse it to generate inlet profile files with the correct global ID and dummy free-stream state to save the trouble of finding the global IDs by hand (that is what we wanted to avoid as well). Then you can at least use excel or another text editor to swap out the data.; - I wouldn't worry about interpolation to start. This can be added later.; - MG is a little tough, but I think we should be able to do a mapping down to the coarse levels in a similar way that we do the restarts in the volume mesh. Can you please check the code in LoadRestart() in solver_direct_mean.cpp where we restrict the solution down onto the coarse levels?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/467#issuecomment-342353441:781,down,down,781,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/467#issuecomment-342353441,2,['down'],['down']

Availability,"Harichand, Giulio, Edwin, and all,. I would definitely prefer to use either (a) an open source library that is actively maintained, or (b) our own tree-based search. I do think that this is important for the various reasons that have been outlined/discussed already. The method Harichand describes is pretty much what we did in the ASC program. Edwin can provide more details (and we had an AIAA paper around 2005 on this topic). My suggestion: if Edwin has a tree search in C++ already and someone is willing to spend the time to integrated it, that would be the best option. We get the performance that is needed with a lightweight tree search, without external dependencies (to libraries that may provide a lot of other functionality we do not need), and we can expand to parallel trees as needed. If there is no code already available, then PCL seems like a good alternative (since it seems one can compile only portions of the library). Any takers?. Cheers,. Juan. On Jun 8, 2016, at 4:35 AM, Harichand M V <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>> wrote:. All,. Thanks for your comments. I think ANNlibrary is no longer maintained. It would be better if we can use a well maintained library in-order to prevent issues in future. Additionally ANNlibrary does not support distributed trees. As far as I know, pointcloud library also does not support distributed trees. I guess we will have to write a wrapper routine using MPI. This will create a local tree for its own portion of the surface mesh. Now distance computation can be done by querying all the trees and using the minimum. One catch here is that we will have to compute distance queries in a group in order to prevent the communication latency eating up the advantage.

Availability,"Have a look at a9466bb158ca8675352bf3b4b887cbf82b7f28ff for a suggestion on how to disable OpDiLib within the scope of the existing build options (casually tested). To clarify the AD implications: If you use OpDiLib, you will have atomic adjoints where no shared reading optimizations are applied, even with `-t 1`. Disabling OpDiLib - if we add that option - will amend this. The presence of `_OPENMP`, however, makes SU2 use the thread-safe CoDiPack type and enables thread-safety augmentations in CoDiPack. Therefore, a reverse AD + OpenMP - OpDiLib build is not the same as a classical serial reverse AD build that is vectorized one way or the other. If we add this, reverse AD + OpenMP - OpDiLib should also print an error for `-t 2` or higher.

Availability,"Hello Economon, here are some of my suggestions for the future convention of comments of the option structure:. 1. __Index__. To illustrate the relationship among so many options, we need to set some reliance relationship manually in the comment lines. Do you think using names of options as index is reliable? I think it will be helpful for code writers, but might not for code readers.; 2. __Relationship__. Here are some kinds of relationship between options. They are needed in comment for auto parsing.; - _Reliance_. Some options may rely on the precedent ones, otherwise they will not be triggered to be used. Furthermore, descendent options may be optional or compulsory. For the optional ones, users don’t have to set the values they need, while for the compulsory ones, users will automatically see the tips of what kinds of options are needed.; - _Mutual Exclusive_. Some options can not coexist together, or their precedent can not coexist together. Maybe option a has precedent A, option b has precedent B. If A and B can not coexist, a and b can’t , too.

Availability,"Hello SU2 developers,. I am reopening this topic because I am studying a case of jet impingement on a wall with a time-varying flow at the inlet. I have used compressible RANS and TOTAL_CONDITIONS as inlet BC. Specifically, I have set a time-varying stagnation pressure at inlet. To do this, I used the Python script mentioned in the previous messages, modifying some commands to suit my problem. I should mention that I do not use Python frequently, so there are likely some errors. Indeed, I checked the documentation and noticed that the command I used to vary the pressure at the inlet (SetMarkerCustomPtotal) is not listed. However, when I run the simulation, it seems to work quite well. Unfortunately, when examining the pressure field, it appears that the time-varying boundary conditions are applied on the walls with no-slip conditions (represented by the MARKER_ISOTHERMAL command) and not at the inlet as I want. Could you please tell me what changes I need to make in the Python script to correctly set up the problem? For completeness, I am attaching the script I modified, the configuration file, and a video of the pressure field.; [2D_jet_val_unsteady_5.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15524970/2D_jet_val_unsteady_5.zip).

Availability,"Hello,. So, to clarify, there were two issues:. 1) With the old commit (382e82f), we were seeing the assertion failure at line 1881 of numerics_structure.cpp, but only with the very large mesh (180 million cells). 2) With the newer commit (c093a62), we were seeing the assertion failure at line 294 of C2DContainer.hpp, which was occurring even with smaller meshes (7 million cells). The solution to (2) appears to be to change `geometry->node[iPoint]->GetnNeighbor()` to `geometry->node[iPoint]->GetnPoint()` at line 3759 of CEulerSolver.cpp, in the `CEulerSolver::SetUpwind_Ducros_Sensor()` method. I made this change locally, and attempted to run on our large mesh. Issue (2) seems to be fixed, but we still run into issue (1). I have now gone through the read restart routines, and have found a potential issue:. For reference, the restart file for our large mesh with averaging data included consists of:; 39 fields * 75,107,967 points = 2,929,210,713 variable values (which is larger than `INT_MAX`). Beginning at line 3931 of CSolver.cpp, in method `CSolver::Read_SU2_Restart_Binary(...)`, we have the following:. ```; int *blocklen = new int[geometry->GetnPointDomain()];; int *displace = new int[geometry->GetnPointDomain()];; int counter = 0;; for (iPoint_Global = 0; iPoint_Global < geometry->GetGlobal_nPointDomain(); iPoint_Global++ ) {; if (geometry->GetGlobal_to_Local_Point(iPoint_Global) > -1) {; blocklen[counter] = nFields;; displace[counter] = iPoint_Global*nFields;; counter++;; }; }; MPI_Type_indexed(geometry->GetnPointDomain(), blocklen, displace, MPI_DOUBLE, &filetype);; ```; The problem here is that for our case, where `iPoint_Global` can get up to 75,107,967 and `nFields` = 39, the value assigned to `displace[counter]` in the loop can over-run `INT_MAX`. This would result in potential garbage / incorrect displace values being passed to `MPI_Type_indexed(...)`. Unfortunately, simply changing `displace` to a `long int *` won't work, as the expected argument type for `",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/949#issuecomment-622026420:111,failure,failure,111,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/949#issuecomment-622026420,4,['failure'],['failure']

Availability,"Hey Rocco,. > And both versions are/were on the develop branches -> what exactly do you refer to here: config-files, code, mesh. The code tags 6.0.1 and 6.2.0 refer to specific master-commits of the code. So I want to know what is exactly of the develop branch, can't be the code if you understand the tags as I do. Maybe you refer to the develop code at the time where these tags were introduced. But maybe sth different. > I guess they converge eventually to the same values. I tried to compare the same case but steady (I attach the summary). Results in this case are fairly similar and (in my opinion) raise no warnings. That is good to hear. ; Luckily @cvencro (Thanks for that 👍 ) ran some tests and found that #740 (which rewrites Euler Wall boundaries for compressible and incompressible flows ... which was me btw) introduces the changes you see. The Euler wall for compressible is changed a bit in the way the boundary condition is enforced. Upon convergence both version should recover (close to) the same value. If the results in a steady state are the same/very-similar and if an unsteady simulation at low enough Reynolds-number converges to the same steady result (or oscillate in the same bounds) -> I would say it is simply some purely numerical effect based on the unphysical initialization and different treatment of the euler wall boundary. . 1 thing one could test additionally is to force a very high convergence in each physical timestep, i.e. usually one converges ~3 orders of magnitude in each ts -> now try converging until residual stalling in each ts. If the code versions get the same/closer results in the temporal evolution my euler wall boundary explanation would be quite reasonable.; Together with the long running unsteady simulation proposed above, I would feel more comfortable to judge. @cvencro (bringing the conversation to this place 😉 ) concerning the pitching case: the `if (dynamic_grid)` statements in the 'old' version are not necessary as that is handle",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/828#issuecomment-562621057:989,recover,recover,989,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/828#issuecomment-562621057,2,['recover'],['recover']

Compilation from scratch was very rapid. . Just a quick thing, the documentation didn't quite work for me but that is probably because my default python is 2.7.

Using the same gradient reconstruction (GG) gives more accurate results. The two SU2 runs were done using identical linear solver parameters.

Availability,"Hey guys... I just want to clarify, as there seems to be three issues being discussed:. Issue 1) SOLVED - This was related to a crash in the the `CEulerSolver::SetUpwind_Ducros_Sensor()` - This can be fixed by changing a call from GetnNeighbor() to GetnPoints() (see my comments on April 30). I don't believe this ended up being related to the overrun in the restart file (Issue 2). Issue 2) SOLVED - This was a crash when starting with very large meshes, caused by an integer overrun in `CSolver::Read_SU2_Restart_Binary()`. This issue is solved by converting the displacement variable to MPI_Aint and using `MPI_Type_create_hindexed()`, instead of `MPI_Type_indexed()`. Issue 3) This is another issue I've been seeing with large simulations: the paraview .vtu files output by SU2 are unable to be read in by Paraview. The error in Paraview is .

Availability,"Hey,. @cvencro and I were discussing this issue quite a bit this morning and here an attempt of a summary:. We are looking at the following cases:; 1. 3D Onera m6, compressible euler, including euler_wall and sym_plane ; a. steady state; b. unsteady (no pitching, deforming); 2. 2D NACA64A010, compressible euler, including euler_wall; a. unsteady (no pitching/ deformation); b. pitching (with rigid and with deforming mesh -> used for the gradient validation of @cvencro 's post ). We are rather certain that the differences between the code-versions are due to the new euler_wall boundary which was introduced in #740 (by me :) ). @cvencro did a test where the old euler_wall was simply pasted into the newer function body (which currently directly calls the sym_plane boundary) -> that recovered the results obtained with the 'older' version. The steady state results (onera m6) show that both codes deliver the same results (of course with some minor differences). So far so good. Unsteady cases are a bit trickier: the latest 2D results of @RoccoBombardieri show pretty much no difference including the first timesteps. The onera m6 case in contrast converges to the same (steady-state) results for both code version eventually but their initial transient phase differs quite significantly. . A possible explanation for the different initial transient phase: In both implementations a ""reflected state"" is constructed where the normal component of the velocity is subtracted [once in the older code version & twice in the newer version]. I.e. subtracting the normal component of velocity twice means mirroring the velocity along the symmetry plane. The newer code version is a bit ""stronger"" in enforcing the boundary conditions which could lead to the reduced oscillation in CD and CL. If we agree that both code versions produce physically correct results for steady cases and unsteady cases that were integrated long enough in time to get rid of the influence of the initial condition ... then",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/828#issuecomment-563314747:789,recover,recovered,789,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/828#issuecomment-563314747,2,['recover'],['recovered']
Availability,"Hey,. Yeah you're right, RegisterVariables was being called for ADJFLOW_SOL. Changing it so that it calls for ADJTURB_SOL throws a seg error (haven't investigated why yet).

Also, the final sensitivity values become non-zero so AD is definitely doing something now. I assumed I had to use the solver_container with ADJTURB_SOL in SetDependencies since the disc_adj_turb flag inside driver_structure is set to true, and so the solver_container with ADJTURB_SOL is instantiated as a new CDiscAdjSolver during the numerics preprocessing.

The two options in your second step sound very interesting and I guess are the only way to get good performance for arithmetic intensive operations, like the ones in the DG solver. If I understand correctly option 1 is something that could be tried already, by applying the external function mechanism to the gemm and gemv functions (akin to what is done now for large linear systems) right? The only downside would be the creation of temporary matrices of passivedouble required to call the blas functions.; With option 2 maybe these temporaries would not be required? As there would be an active matrix class whose internal data structures would be passive matrices that could interface with blas directly?.

Availability,"Hi Economon,. I encountered an issue very similar to what Auzbaig reported: the error message ""OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION: invalid option value EntropyGeneration"" during optimization with SU2. (I am using SU2 version 8.0.1 ""Harrier.""). After thoroughly examining the existing Python optimization framework, I found that one of the steps in the optimization chain is generating different config.cfg files, with a focus on DV_VALUE and OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION. DV_VALUE controls the geometry deformation;; OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION determines the type of objective/constraints.; Then the framework calls SU2_CFD and SU2_DOT to obtain performance metrics or gradient information.; As you mentioned, ""You might need to run updateHistoryMap.py to register new outputs with Python."" Initially, I thought it meant simply providing a new input for OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION in the Python optimization framework. However, it seems that this may not work at the C++ level. To verify this, I ran $ SU2_CFD your_config.cfg -d and observed all available history outputs. However, I suspect that OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION cannot use every history output, meaning that the adjoint solver might not recognize some objective functions. Does this imply that additional modifications in the C++ code are required?. Additionally, I would appreciate more information regarding CUSTOM_OBJFUNC. From TestCases/user_defined_functions/lam_flatplate.cfg, I understand that CUSTOM_OBJFUNC allows combinations of existing OBJECTIVE_FUNCTIONs and can also utilize CUSTOM_OUTPUTS. The flexibility of CUSTOM_OUTPUTS seems to enable the construction of various desired variables. However, I am unsure whether using OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION= CUSTOM_OBJFUNC along with CUSTOM_OUTPUTS can entirely replace the need for additional modifications in the C++ code. Since I’m not very proficient in C++, I would greatly appreciate your guidance.

Availability,"Hi Eduardo,. both, 'symmetry plane' and 'symmetry as the slip wall' should work in the code (upon fixing this) and it should be made clear (e.g. in the config_template.cfg) what the BC is suitable for, independent of how it is named in the end. ; The simplest solution is probably the patch I provided together with a short note in the config_template (maybe even a reference to this issue), as both 'options' will work as expected (using the very same code). It will basically 'restore' the behaviour of MARKER_SYM of before the fix in #657. The downside is some more computational cost (in case of a plane) which has to be done for each vertex on the marker. I cant say to which extend this takes more time but I would guess it is not too costly. Depends on the case as well. I can do a little check with your case here. . That's it for the diplomatic part :) (Please take the following with a grain). For me a symmetry has to be a line or plane. To cite Jiri Blazek's book 'Computational Fluid Dynamics'(...) 3rd edition using a screenshot:. ![blazekbook](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31306376/61662377-9ab05a80-acce-11e9-85bf-5998db204d92.png). The chapter is called 'symmetry plane' which already is kinda biased. But there is no 'slip wall for viscous flow' mentioned to my knowledge. In another book (from Ferziger&Peric, which I only have in german) symmetry is only used in the context of symmetry planes as well. ; To me, symmetry BC's are also linked to visualization using mirroring. And mirroring (as the word is commonly meant) is only possible along planes and its little brother, the straight line. I can be wrong or it might be a question of research background. So how to proceed? Trial by combat might have some unpleasant aftermath for the winner so we might go the democratic way and do a poll :) .

Availability,"Hi Jean,; Sorry for the delay. The hypothesis I have for the less robust behavior of periodic BC's is that the linear solver is not completely aware of the periodicity. In fact after the linear solve we have to force the matching nodes to have the same value.; This is done in CFVMFlowSolverBase.hpp::CompleteImplicitIteration_impl, in the call to InitiatePeriodicComms.; The idea is to make the linear solver aware of the periodicity, to do so would require including periodic communications in the preconditioners and the matrix-vector product.; These are all in CSysMatrix.cpp, so before each of the `/*--- MPI Parallelization ---*/` bits we would need periodic comms, for preconditioners these comms would simply make the values equal, like in CSolver::InitiatePeriodicComms(PERIODIC_IMPLICIT) whereas for the matrix-vector product we need to add the values (effectively periodicity splits a row of the matrix into two ""half rows"") and this would be similar to what is done with the linear residual in CSolver::InitiatePeriodicComms(PERIODIC_RESIDUAL).; I think @TobiKattmann was also interested in having a look into this.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1467#issuecomment-1017640248:66,robust,robust,66,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1467#issuecomment-1017640248,2,['robust'],['robust']

You are right, and the TestCases repository is starting to be huge, mainly because of the stuff that GitHub generates to track the files. Easy to maintain/access alternatives are very welcome.

Availability,"Hi Pedro,. I tried the other solution you suggested. I declared a new private variable inside the solver class, which I assigned as config->cb1_usrdef. I registered this as the AD input. I then set a method inside the solver class which returns this value when called.; In the Numerics class, instead of reading cb1 from Config as I used to, I read it from the Solver class, using the method mentioned above.; Now I couldn't create a Solver object inside numerics_structure.inl, since according to the compilation order the solver class is dependant on the numerics class (Solver_structure.hpp includes numerics_structure.hpp). So the compiler doesn't know about the solver class while inside the numerics.; To work around the compiler error, instead I included the solver header file inside the numerics src files (cpp). I then created the solver objects in the relevant numerics functions and called the method which returns the AD-registered cb1 variable.; This all compiles now, but the AD gradient is still returned as 0. Adding print statements to the functions inside the numerics src files revealed that they are getting a cb1 value of 0, which I assume it's because solver_adjoint_discrete.cpp is called after the numerics src files have read the value of cb1, which at that point would be 0.; Would you agree that it's probably best to update the numerics classes inside the adjoint iteration class for CDiscAdjSolver, similar to what's done inside CDiscAdjFEAIteration?

Availability,"Hi Ruben, no worries. Integrating on the fluid side is what makes sense for matching meshes, less hassle given the availability of dual grid information, no need for MPI boiler plate, etc. The adjoint implications are being accounted for, this integration step is being recorded and overall the dependencies have not changed, the fluid nodes are still the ones defining the direction of the stress.; As you can see from the files I attached, the sensitivities are very similar for conservative/consistent interpolation cases. . It is not possible to generalise this for conservative interpolation (i.e. using the transpose of the displacement interpolation matrix to interpolate tractions) because that approach implicitly takes care of the (possible) different areas associated with fluid and solid nodes. If you transfer stresses with conservative interpolation and then integrate you get the wrong force. The conservative approach requires forces to be transferred, otherwise we start taking liberties with the meaning of the word :).

Availability,"Hi Tobi,. Great to see the same dynamic behaviour from both boundary conditions for the ONERA M6 case after the changes you've tested for the convective flux residuals. The differences seen in the dynamic results are important and since the change in boundary condition wasn't intended to cause these changes in the dynamic solution, I think we should be able to reproduce what we had originally. I think the same is also true for the problems with grid motion, as a minimum we should be able to reproduce the same result with the new boundary condition as we had with the old Euler wall. If it then comes down to choices of different convective schemes that we can employ with the new boundary condition then perhaps as further work the different available choices could be investigated to explore which option gives the most accurate result compared against references in literature?. I ran some tests for 2D cases with grid motion using both boundary conditions for us to use here. I started with the NACA64A010 airfoil @RoccoBombardieri tested, now with the pitching motion re-included, and looked at the periodic behaviour. [pitching_NACA64A010.zip](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/3963760/pitching_NACA64A010.zip). ![NACA64A010](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33747655/70848141-f7223b00-1e64-11ea-876c-0751b187fea4.png). Using the Euler wall boundary condition, the results still match exactly to @economon 's thesis (no real surprise as I suspect the code hasn't changed much for this comparison) and this agrees pretty closely with other inviscid reference results like Jamesons's unsteady flow past airfoils. With the symmetry plane, the results differ from the other inviscid solutions but the agreement to the experiment is better. I couldn't get hold of reference drag or moment results to compare against, therefore the comparison is only against lift.

If the old results can exactly be recovered for the 3D case discussed, then I recommend updating the code with the changes you've made for the JST convective residual as default since those were the original results and they have also been validated in @RoccoBombardieri 's study. I've just tried the branch `testing_symmetry_plane` with the recommended settings for the NACA0012 pitching airfoil case. With the JST convective residual calculation, the results still appear to be different on initial look. Something still appears to be not right when grid motion is included.

Availability,"Hi Tom,. The code is running with nice results. However, at low Mach numbers, the code is presenting poor convergence due to the wide disparity between the particle and acoustic wave speeds in the dual time stepping.

Availability,"Hi Tom,. Yes, we can temporarily strip off some of the excess variables, and we may just do that in the short-term to continue the simulation. In fact, I'm not sure the averaged variables are used (is the time-averaging continued from restart, or is it started from scratch at restart?). If the time-averaged variables from the restart aren't used, then another fix would be to change what is output in the restart file vs. what is output in the visualization files (vtu, szplt, etc). Regardless, in an earlier simulation, we were attempting to run a 450 million cell mesh, which would have probably caused the same overrun with just the conservatives, so I agree that we'll have to start planning on how to deal with this issue down the road when larger meshes become more commonplace. Not sure the best forum to discuss this kind of thing. Github? Slack? Email?. Hope you are well,. Paul. ________________________________; From: Thomas D.

I found to have to no problem when merging the develop first -> clearing all tabs/whitespaces in the feature_branch with the provided script -> merge this develop_noWhitespaces using the `--strategy-option=ours` option. Merge conflicts will be purely due to tabs/whitespaces therefore one always wants the own code in case of conflict, as all conflicts with the develop related to other stuff were already resolved in the first merge. . Now that the commit is a lot smaller, there should be even less problems. Maybe some folks will have no problems at all. .

Availability,"Hi all,; really interesting topic going on here. As @pcarruscag just very well explained, and after quite some time working on the code, I can totally see the need for dense algebra. . I agree with @juanjosealonso and @erangit that maintaining the code portable and very easy to install should be a must. It has been a signature of SU2 since the beginning and we should continue on that line. I've had some problems before with codes that rely heavily on PETSc, so I wouldn't particularly be keen to go down that road. . **Eigen** would be really easy to integrate in SU2: they have a mirror on GitHub here: [Eigen Github repo](https://github.com/eigenteam/eigen-git-mirror) which could be easily added as a submodule in the same way as CoDiPack or MeDiPack. Given that they are only header files, there would be no need to compile any external library. And there is another very important point made by @vdweide and @pcarruscag: we need to ensure compatibility with the discrete adjoint functionality. One huge advantage of Eigen is that is fully templated: we recently differentiated a code that was heavy reliant on Eigen in an afternoon, and it worked great. While LAPACK is indeed a very mature library, I believe that it would require using external functions for every functionality, which would be a really big burden. @talbring @MaxSagebaum could add some more hints in this discussion.

May I just add to Edwin comment: some of you have seen the tests that I; made with SUmb (structured mesh code) using the adaptive WF: Results using; the JST scheme were definitely off, while upwind +WF converged reasonably; to wall-resolved results.

Availability,"Hi,. @pcarruscag , I tried few more runs (Roe Jacobians with SLAU (2)) with this case and they ran well at CFL 500 for Mach 0.1 to 0.3 at M=0.4, it dips to ~400 and I think that trend will continue downward. I ran it for Mach 0.8 and CFL was restricted to ~25.0. So it’s a very surprising/peculiar behaviour observed with this case and as you rightly said that it is good to keep both the options. . @economon , can you share any experience of first vs second order analytical Jacobians (personal work, references/papers). Working out a second order Jacobian will be a really arduous task (and there can be other specific issues related to specific schemes as well). Consistent discretization with 1st order analytical Jacobian is likely to be better than inconsistent discretization for both 1st and 2nd order accurate simulations (in general). I was curious to look at any reference showing the real/comparative gains one will have with second order accurate analytical Jacobians. Another thing, many of the commercial codes use different strategies coupled with good linear solvers to have really good convergence rates (probably I mentioned this earlier as well).

I want to strengthen a point mentioned by Eitan.; Using a specific non-dimension form available in the SU2, the hard-coded low limit values may be too high. In fact, they may interrupt the solution to reach a realizable lower value.

Availability,"Hi,. Regarding the cross-diffusion term (CD) that appears in Omega source term (residual). The SST model (1994/2003) is a high-Reynolds-number model. Namely, It can not predict correctly the sub-layer region (especially the correct profile of the TKE). Therefore, only a positive contribution is required. Moreover, since the SST model was design as a k-w and k-epsilon blending, the CD term ""belongs"" only to the k-epsilon ""branch"", that is why the CD term include the factor ""1-F1"". However, it may happen, that the factor ""1-F1"" is not a 100% safe guarantee. It may happen that ""1-F1"" is not zero in region where the CD term is negative (this happen due numerical errors). To avoid such a situation, it is a good idea to clip the CD term with zero. Otherwise, severe numerical robustness issues may rise. ; Yes, it is different from Menter publications, but I think that clipping the CD term with zero is completely inline with Menter original idea (that is why, I think, he was including the factor ""1-F1"". But again the 1-F1 factor is not 100% percent ""safe"").",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2329#issuecomment-2251561287:667,error,errors,667,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2329#issuecomment-2251561287,2,"['error', 'robust']","['errors', 'robustness']"

Availability,"Hi,; I like this idea of self registering classes for our factories, although the instantiation logic is seldom as linear as converting a name to a type... Maybe you could refactor just one of our factories to give us a better idea of what it could look like?. This issue of ""modularizing"" pieces of the code is central to the refactoring of the optimization framework, which will require significant chunks of the code to be exposed to python, so by all means get involved in that (join #refactor_optimization on SU2 Slack and the developer meetings, Wednesdays at 4pm CET). Personally I think this flavour of extensibility is small fish compared to other structural problems we are currently addressing (duplication, code bloat, performance, robustness, etc.) and in my opinion addressing those issues will make it easier to extend the code in this manner, not harder.; Also from the pure C++ side I see no problem with having to modify the code... In so doing the new code is automatically under the same open source license, which to me is as good thing. A couple of practical considerations:; - About your examples, we want fewer drivers, not more. The methods of CVariable, CPoint, and co. need to be inline if the code is to have any semblance of performance.; - I think the majority of the code should still be statically linked, even if some parts of it can be extended by means of custom dynamic libraries, because that will just be less problematic for folks who build from source but are not developers. > The design I described above doesn't take into account C++ templates as I don't see them used that frequently (Is that a thing?). It is becoming a thing yes absolutely, although not at the very highest levels of abstraction. > Please, Please, we have to stop using raw pointers like that. It's being done...

Availability,"I don't think the fix is as simple as it seems.; Indeed looking back at how we developed the CGNS reader, It was originally meant to read multiple zone in a single file. But during development, someone decided to restrict the reader to only one zone per file (and I don't know if it was validated). So now we are seating in the middle. If we replace line 169 of CGNSFVMMeshReader :; <pre>; if ( nzones > 1 ) {; SU2_MPI::Error(string(""CGNS reader currently expects only 1 zone per CGNS file."") +; string(""Multizone problems can be run with separate CGNS files for each zone.""), CURRENT_FUNCTION);; }; </pre>; by; <pre>; if ( cgnsZone > nzones) {; cgnsZone = 1;; }; </pre>. we can easily support multiple zone in one file. To support one CGNS zone per file, I guess that user should provide either the index in the cgns file of the zone we want to read or even better its name and not rely on SU2 numbering of zones. I think that supporting multiple mesh zones in the same file at the same time as one zone per mesh file should be possible as long as enough information is provided by the user. In this case, I am wondering how the option MULTIZONE_MESH and MULTIZONE option are interacting in the related issue. When MULTIZONE_MESH is set to NO do we expect one mesh file per zone ?; And in this case we can force CGNS Reader to read only the first Zone. In a more generic way something like this should be possible:; MULTIZONE=YES; CONFIG_LIST= (zone_1.cfg, zone_2.cfg, zone_3.cfg); CGNSZONENAMES = (""FluidRotor"", ""Solid"", ""FluidStator"") # To let CGNS pick the right zone in the file and if it not found the first zone can be used (current SU2 behavior).

For a pitching airfoil case with FFD design variables, the average difference in gradients for an objective function of L/D was within 1% between discrete adjoint and finite differences. This is very similar for both imposed grid velocities in the adjoint preprocessing and with the FD calculation for the grid velocities.

Availability,"I just pushed a new version of your inlet profile branch. I really like the solver class abstractions. I can tell you have a good grip on the classes and where data should live - nice job. Here are the changes I have made:; * everything is generalized in parallel for an arbitrary number of inlets in the file. The file format changed slightly.; * I moved around some routines and data to take more advantage of inheritance and encapsulation: it is now more like the restart routines where the reading and data live in the parent CSolver class, the specific load functions are found in the solvers (I overloaded SetInletAtVertex), and the template file is written by COutput. It is written such that any solver could eventually use it for any marker type by adding the appropriate SetInletAtVertex routine for solver-specific data (might need to rename for different marker types rather than inlet) and writing an appropriate template file writer in the output.; * for now, it is still requiring a essentially a matching profile point (nearest neighbor within a tight tolerance) by default, but you can have an arbitrary number of points in the file for each marker, and we can eventually add interpolation easily. We already have some of these routines.; * the turbulent solvers now all use the Inlet_TurbVars data structure even for uniform inlets. Can you please check this with Python?; * multigrid is now working. I put in a boundary face area-averaged restriction operator for the inlet profiles. Any decent approximation on the coarse levels should work ok. I left all of your original routines there, but deactivated them for the moment. Can you please give it a look and let me know what you think (and whether it is working for you)? Feedback most welcome.

Availability,"I totally agree. On real meshes, Omega usually drops to extremely low values. In cases where the cross-diffusion term is negative (allowed to be negative), it behaves as a sink term, further amplifying the drop of Omega. A simple addition of this term to the implicit diagonal is insufficient (I tried this). Other more rigorous methods are required (some available in the open literature). .

The final value in both the donor and target arrays are 1D values, the values at nSpanDonor - 2 are the values at the shroud. I think the original proposed fix is still needed here as further down you have an array accessing a postion of `kSpan + 1` which iirc resulted in the memory access violation. I think what has happened here is the Aachen case triggers this condition, and results in an error in the calculation of the coefficient for the linear interpolation. When we fixed it, we changed the simulation enough that it throws the residuals off as the computational problem is inherently different. A good test for this would be to extract the values at the interface from the turbomachinery special output with and without this change to see if this is the case.

Availability,"I'll try to break down each request to make it clearer. Request: Use nomenclature consistent with the C++ interface (point instead of node, etc.); Reason: People who know the C++ interface will know how to use the python wrapper straight away, people who learn how to use the python wrapper will be able to understand the C++ implementation (without needing a translation layer in their mind all the time). Request: Return connectivity/adjacency as local indices instead of global; Reason: This is the natural way of referencing data in an MPI code, local indices correspond directly to data stored in the partition thereby making it more efficient to access (without global-to-local conversions, which are much more expensive than local-to-global). Furthermore, the local ordering strategy improves the efficiency of loops (over edges, neighboring points, etc.). Request: Do not apply unnecessary ""transformations"" to the connectivity/adjacency as part of the API; Reason: Increases the maintenance burden and makes for a less versatile API. By returning the local indices that form a marker or element, it is trivial to retrieve any other data for those indices (the ""transformation""). For example, the solution at those points, the point coordinates, whether the points are halo or domain points, the global indices, etc.; This way, by adding a **single** function to the API e.g. get the global index of a point of element, the functionality of the API grows a lot more because the user can apply the function to **any** connectivity/adjacency function. Request: Do not offer too many overloads of the same function; Reason: Increases the maintenance burden and it's returning the data in structures that are not very efficient, namely vector of vectors. It is much easier to offer domain-wide data access on the python side, as a very small function that can be part of wrapper utilities (i.e. live only in python but not c++).

Availability,"I'm the one who created that warning message, so I can fill in some details about when and why that error message occurs. For adaptive mesh refinement, SU2 looks at each element and checks how important it would be to divide that element. It then assigns a numeric value (a ""sensor"") to each element representing the relative importance. That sensor is normalized by the max value and is assumed to be positive, so its range should be from 0 to 1. SU2 defines a number of elements that it wants to create (4455 in your case). It then loops through all the elements and looks for elements whose sensors fall above a threshold. That threshold starts at 0.999, close to the max value of 1. If an element has a sensor above that threshold, SU2 marks that cell for division. If it doesn't find enough elements, then it lowers the threshold and continues looking. That process continues all the way down till the threshold hits 0. Sometimes, SU2 can't find enough elements to adapt. The threshold goes all the way to 0, and there's still not enough. Then it prints that warning and continues. That's what you're seeing. The code only mentions triangles, quadrilaterals, and tetrahedrons as a guess to what's wrong. You'll notice it says your grid ""may"" have too high a percentage of other types. If your grid were composed solely of hexahedrons, for example, then it won't find any elements to adapt and print that warning message. There's no check to confirm that this guess is actually correct. In your case, you only have quads and triangles, so the guess is obviously mistaken. As to what is actually going wrong in your case, I would have to dig in a little deeper to find out what's going on. I would guess that your elements aren't being marked as ""divisible,"" but I'm not sure why.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/606#issuecomment-434924444:100,error,error,100,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/606#issuecomment-434924444,2,"['down', 'error']","['down', 'error']"

During the output of the periodic mesh in `SU2_MSH`, `CPeriodicGeometry::SetMeshFile` sorts the nodes into the order normal, receive, send. This can be found in [lines 18798-18819 of Common/src/geometry_structure](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/blob/68991cd1005cf118e1ff21b8952bb366bb299cf3/Common/src/geometry_structure.cpp#L18798). I've copied down the lines here for reference:. ```cpp; /*--- Change the numbering to guarantee that the all the receive; points are at the end of the file ---*/; unsigned long OldnPoint = geometry->GetnPoint();; unsigned long *NewSort = new unsigned long[nPoint];; for (iPoint = 0; iPoint < nPoint; iPoint++) {; NewSort[iPoint] = iPoint;; }; ; unsigned long Index = OldnPoint-1;; for (iMarker = 0; iMarker < nMarker; iMarker++) {; if (bound[iMarker][0]->GetVTK_Type() == VERTEX) {; if (config->GetMarker_All_SendRecv(iMarker) < 0) {; for (iElem_Bound = 0; iElem_Bound < nElem_Bound[iMarker]; iElem_Bound++) {; if (bound[iMarker][iElem_Bound]->GetNode(0) < geometry->GetnPoint()) {; NewSort[bound[iMarker][iElem_Bound]->GetNode(0)] = Index;; NewSort[Index] = bound[iMarker][iElem_Bound]->GetNode(0);; Index--;; }; }; }; }; }; ```. In order to sort the points, a list mapping the old points to the new points (`NewSort`) is created. The problem is that this list is sorted by switching nodes. But it doesn't switch around the _contents_ of the list (i.e. two node numbers from the list). Instead it switched an index from the list and an actual node number pulled from the geometry. This presents two problems:. 1. If any of the receive nodes actually are at the end of the list, they will get switched away from the end of the list.; 2. If any node is switched twice, data is lost. That's because the sorting assumes that the elements being switched have not already been switched. This is how the three points went missing from the cube problem I previously referenced.

You may consider creating some interpolation functions (with all the safeguards and error codes) in C++ based on the SUmb code (which was structured in a C++-like way) or at least take inspiration from that approach to identify interpolation utilities / libraries in C++ that could be used for the same purpose.

Availability,"It seems like your situation may have been resolved, but for archival purposes, I'll list my workaround here. This problem occurs when you've installed python packages in two different locations. This could be due to installing some python packages in a system directory (e.g. `/usr/lib/`) and some in a user directory (e.g. `~/.local/`). SU2's build process is set to automatically detect the default package location, but it's not equipped to handle multiple package locations. There are some hardcoded includes, but these only work for python 2.7. I don't consider this a bug *per se* because multiple python package directories is not a standard use case. #### The symptoms. When building SU2 with the python wrapper you'll see the following error during the swig build:; ```; <install directory>/../SU2_PY/pySU2/pySU2.i:64: Error: Unable to find 'mpi4py/mpi4py.i'; ```; But mpi4py is indeed installed on your system and it's on your python path, as confirmed by opening a python terminal and running `import mpi4py`. #### The easiest workaround. Switch to a [virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). This will ensure that all of your python packages are stored in single location. #### Alternate workaround. In this method, you change the hardcoded includes to match mpi4py's package location. First I figure out where my mpi4py is installed. I start a terminal session of python using the python environment I want to use (in this case, it's python 3.6), and then run:; ```; from mpi4py import MPI; MPI; ```. Since I have mpi4py installed on your system and it's on my python path, I see something like:; ```; <module 'mpi4py.MPI' from '/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mpi4py/MPI.cpython-34m.so'>; ```. The `/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python3.6/` directory is where my mpi4py package is installed. But the swig compile command includes `/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python2.7/`.

Availability,"My previous post used a linear solver precision of 1E-6. I ran a couple of test cases at near machine precision (a linear solver tolerance of 1E-14) and higher CFL number (CFL=150), with no CFL adaptation. As suggested, I used ILU+FGMRES. I capped the maximum number of linear solver iterations at 200, and did not raise any errors if the linear solver stopped at 200 iterations with less than 1E-14. The linear solver didn't exceed 200 iterations for the RANS equations, but it did for the Navier-Stokes equations. Once again, there doesn't appear to be a huge difference. For the flat-plate, the results were almost identical:. ![flat_plate_improved](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13340225/35233993-595fe2d4-ff65-11e7-9fd6-4b98f30b4d75.png).

I believe overall convergence was similar because the Navier-Stokes solver, not the turbulence-solver, is the limiting factor when it comes to precision. The linear solver always converged on a turbulence solution with high precision in under 50 linear solver iterations. Meanwhile, the linear solver sometimes failed to find a Navier-Stokes solution within 1E-14 even after 200 iterations. The only way to make the Navier-Stokes solver converge to 1E-14 was to use small time steps (CFL ~= 1) at difficult points in the overall convergence.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/491#issuecomment-359811658:129,toler,tolerance,129,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/491#issuecomment-359811658,2,"['error', 'toler']","['errors', 'tolerance']"

Availability,"Nice progress @pcarruscag!. I like the concept of your SIMD-friendly class that will take care of the data structure under the hood coupled with a standard type of loop statement (w/ +SIMDLEN). This should make it pretty easy for folks to still modify the kernels without having to worry about the data alignment, and they can reuse the same simple 'for' construct repeatedly. . Another reason to have our own lightweight class for this is that you can avoid dependence on OpenMP for SIMD (although that feature looks to have potential and wasn't available until somewhat recently) as well as the intrinsics. In my experience, the latter is especially bad for portability and readability (part of why we left the CaF work in a separate repo). It starts to become so specialized that compiling and modifying become difficult. W.r.t. OpenMP, another roadblock there a few years ago was making sure it is interoperable with CoDi for the adjoint, but I know this has been worked on and may be available by now. Might keep an open mind about point vs. edge. In some places, we may be able to pump up the compute in our loops by fusing kernels, as previously discussed (and I am guessing you are working on this already with gradients/limiters). Could change the final performance numbers significantly. Lastly, I know you are not there yet, but it is worth considering whether you can reuse anything you are developing in the kernels here for the linear solver routines. At some point, you will successfully reduce the cost of the residual kernels (RHS) to the bandwidth limit, and the majority of the iteration cost will be in the linear solver (it is already about 50% of the iteration cost before optimization, if I recall). Before making final decisions on strategy, you should consider if it will help in any of the linear solver routines too.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-530440072:547,avail,available,547,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-530440072,4,['avail'],['available']

Availability,No. I tried a couple of things but ran into problems with both of them and I haven't done anything about it since. The first was to use one of the old MPI routines (like Set_MPI_ActDisk) to couple the two faces so they can communicate the residuals with each other. This was quite cumbersome and I did not want to copy paste large chunks of code. The other one was to set the two faces as periodic boundaries with zero distance between them but if I remember correctly this did not work because the MatchPeriodic routine gave an error back then.

Availability,"On the subject of virtual functions I would like to put another idea forward.; After moving things around in #725 I noticed that we have tons of `inline virtual` methods.; The keyword `inline` has two meanings to the compiler:; - ""Dear merciful compiler please copy paste the body of this function and then do all your wonderful optimizations, if that pleases your excellency.""; - ""Dear forgiving compiler, you will find this method defined in multiple units, please don't be mad"" (i.e. ignore the one-definition-rule). `virtual` means determine what version of the method to call at runtime. This is not compatible with the first (and often the intended one) meaning of inline, therefore the compiler will in general not inline those methods.; They will only be inlined if they are being called on a pointer to the derived class that does not declare the method to be virtual anymore. CSolver knows what variables it creates and so in hot areas of the code it could do a static downcast to allow inlining (e.g. `static_cast<CEulerVariable*>(node[iNode])->DoStuff()`).; Where is this important? For example when computing gradients, where simple additions and subtractions are hidden behind virtual functions.; If you are worried about maintenance each solver can typedef its most safe downcast level or better yet (or just more modern), methods that could benefit from this can be templated for the type of downcast.; Those in favour say Yea those against say Nay.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/716#issuecomment-509273008:979,down,downcast,979,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/716#issuecomment-509273008,8,"['down', 'mainten']","['downcast', 'maintenance']"

Availability,"Our proposal does not relate to the SST's good behavior (iThe SST model is not sensitive to Omega freestream value: it is because of the addition of the cross-diffusion term, which was absent in the original Wilcox model). The current implicit treatment in the SU2 may generate a negative solution that is not physical. A low limit value is available in the code to avoid a negative solution. This means the solution is clipped to this value if the solution reaches a lower value. There is no single absolute low-limit value that is suitable, for example, issues with dimension vs. non-dimension form. Our proposal circumvents this problem. The current situation in the code is not robust. We suffer from many robustness issues, especially with the SST2003 model. However, using our proposal significantly enhanced the solver's robustness. The current situation is like a ""bug"" because it may interfere with the solution. We understand that our idea requires a lot of effort and that it would make the code unreproducible. Therefore, we would like to suggest the following: Give the user an option to control these low-limit values. The default values will be according to the hard-coded values. We also strongly recommend adding additional user low-limit values control according to our proposal. The user will be able to decide which option he prefers. Our end goal is to design the implicit treatment so that these low-limit controls will be almost redundant. Based on several publications I've made during the last 15-20 years, my code enjoys this feature.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2323#issuecomment-2231452852:341,avail,available,341,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2323#issuecomment-2231452852,5,"['avail', 'redundant', 'robust']","['available', 'redundant', 'robust', 'robustness']"
Availability,"Our proposed changes implicitly include 2 modifications to current code: ; The first is the modification of the lower limit such that it should be relative to a reference value. The rational for this is that a single given hard coded number cannot be correct for possible all flow regimes. Moreover, even running the same case in dimensional and non dimensional form, will lead to different behaviour of the lower limit. The proposed solution therefore is defining a limit relative to reference values, namely:; k_low_limit = C_k * K_infinity; w_low_limit = C_w * W_infinity. This change will inevitably cause changes to current behaviour (as can be seen in test case results), but we believe it is more correct. . The second, is giving the user control over C_k and C_w and the choice of the default value. As mentioned above, the behaviour of the proposed default value will inevitably be different than the existing one. Even if we choose default values that will lead to similar values to those existing for a certain case this would not be true for other cases. Therefore no default value can be given to reconstruct the current solver behaviour. ; The values suggested as default are not the most correct per se, but rather robust suggestions based on experience and are open to discussion. Optimal default values of different cases, say external and internal flows are expected to be different, this is why we felt it important to allow user control of the lower limit. . We emphasise that the solution used in SU2 of applying a lower limit to turbulence variables in order keep the solution positive is somewhat artificial, and future features we are working on should minimize the need for such a treatment, however, as long as this is the solution implemented, we believe that the proposed change is more correct, leading to more robust behaviour.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2323#issuecomment-2230214740:1230,robust,robust,1230,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/2323#issuecomment-2230214740,2,['robust'],['robust']

Availability,"Sorry for the late reply, here are some personal opinions. (1) I have also test the turb flatplate and Onera M6 case (Fig1.Original; Fig2.Submit) in the tutorials. The convengence and results also shows just slightly difference. . (2) This PR is not suitable for the euler wall, for the wall is not always a straight plane and singular points do not statisfy the condition for the normal direction is hard to define. (3) Well, I have noticed the BC_Sym_Plane before, but it is very puzzling to me that only the closed point to the vertex on the sym wall is considered to add additional negative normal flux contribution. Maybe the mesh is unstructured and more than one point out of wall is linked to the vortex. Maybe the closed point is not normal to the wall while it always occurs on the 3D sym plane such as the ONERA M6 wing case. (4) This PR is to add a limitation of the velocity on the sym wall, just like what we do to the turb walls in the CTurbSSTSolver::CTurbSSTSolver(CGeometry *geometry, CConfig *config, unsigned short iMesh).

Availability,"Thank you for your comment. No need to create dummy points for periodic BC is really an ingenious design and when I run RANS/URANS cases, I get good results. But there are still some problems for me, the first is convergence when I run big 3D cases and the second is the periodic BC cannot cooperate with hybrid RANS/LES method. So I thought a dummy layer is sometimes necessary just as in Blazek's book(Computational Fluid Dynamics: Principles and Applications, Second Edition, Page 293). ; ![book](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/assets/58663453/cd5a29ba-4f75-40a0-8530-edfd1523d9b7). One dummy layer need to communicate solution, gradients or maybe Laplacian, sensors and so on. It's still complex so I choose two dummy layers to only communicate solution. As in the picture, the original use the send-recieve pair1 as periodic BCs and this feature need four pairs with a restriction that the outermost four layers should be structured grids. Three more repeated mesh sections are indeed added but it is acceptable in terms of robustness and reducing data communication.; ![pairs](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/assets/58663453/1d7c5005-b704-40a6-88dd-518e09082eea).

Availability,Thanks @economon this makes a lot of sense. And if it goes ahead maybe the options DEFORM_LINEAR_SOLVER_ITER and DEFORM_LINEAR_ITER should also be fused?. This is has a smallish negative implication to FSI cases. There because the deformation is incremental it is acceptable to converge the solver to 1e-6 or only 1e-5.

Availability,"Thanks Edwin, the vectorized loops in the code are probably very simple array copies, hence the low efficiency? I would put money on not a single vector instruction being generated for the important stuff. I was surprised by the 1.25 to 1.3 factor you are seeing, for the exact same case I measured 1.39 (to be more precise). Initially I thought it had something to do with running single core, thus leaving vast amounts of L3 for only that core to use, so on the same 24c platform I ran 2 processes (30MB of cache for each) (very uncivilised) and the factor went down to 1.37, so cache was not the reason.; So then I thought maybe the Intel compilers are very good at optimizing polymorphism away, but the development branch compiled with icc 17 runs at exactly the same speed as when compiled with gcc 5.4. Then I compiled feature_contiguous_cvariable with icc 17 and it runs 9% slower than the gcc binaries, and so with icc 17 the speedup for this case was 1.27 errrrr...

Availability,"Thanks Tom. And, as mentioned before, let’s have a bit of a discussion as to which wall functions formulations would make most sense to implement. I am pretty sure that we can create a generic implementation that can then be used for standard wall functions, but also for adaptive wall functions (see Medic, G., Kalitzin, G., et al., “Adaptive Wall Functions with Applications”, 2006), and even compressible/incompressible formulations. The adaptive wall function trick is quite useful as it makes the wall function implementation more robust to the varying y+ of the first cell of the surface of the geometry and lessens the burden during the grid generation stage.

Availability,Thanks for testing. Both gradient methods use all the neighboring points. Green Gauss has special treatment for boundary surfaces and it must be particularly less accurate than least squares at these points.; With that said the way we handle intersecting boundaries is very important. For this case https://su2code.github.io/vandv/swbli/ I had to add an Euler wall after the inlet to prevent the kind of issues you are seeing.; My concern is that making things locally first order is just masking the problem with numerical dissipation.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2285#issuecomment-2127331419:489,mask,masking,489,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2285#issuecomment-2127331419,1,['mask'],['masking']

Availability,"Thanks for the detailed analysis... out of curiosity, how tightly did you converge the linear solve with each nonlinear iteration? . Lately, we have seen that the ILU preconditioner performs best, and, when solving the linear systems to a smaller tolerance, one can often use a higher CFL number. It could be interesting to look at the convergence of the linear solve for a single nonlinear iteration (at different points of the calculation) for GMRES+ILU to a near machine precision tolerance both with and without the term in the Jacobian. That might best show the impact of this term.

Availability,"Thanks, with these build commands, I can reproduce the ""`2.0 == 0.7`"" unit test error in an MPICH environment, when running the test with a single MPI process (`mpirun.mpich -np 1`). For multiple MPI processes, the test passes in my current setup. The error persists when I disable OpenMP. When I use OpenMPI instead of MPICH, the test driver crashes for `-np 1` (""An error occurred in MPI_Win_create ... MPI_ERR_WIN: invalid window"") but probably that is a different issue. After some std::cout debugging, I suspect that the MPICH implementation of [`MPI_Allgatherv`](https://www.mpich.org/static/docs/v3.2/www3/MPI_Allgatherv.html) is not working as expected in the case of a single MPI process. . I would expect that if there is only a single MPI process, `MPI_Allgatherv` copies `sendcount*sizeof(scalartype)`=`recvcounts[0]*sizeof(scalartype)` bytes from `(scalartype*)sendbuf` to `(scalartype*)recvbuf+displs[0]`, where `scalartype` is the C type represented by the MPI types `sendtype`=`recvtype`. This is the behaviour I had in mind when writing the NdFlattener code. With [minimal.cpp.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/10459977/minimal.cpp.txt) (remove the .txt), OpenMPI gives the following results:; ```bash; $ mpic++ minimal.cpp -o minimal ; $ mpirun -np 1 ./minimal; Rank 0 recvbuf = -42 100 ; $ mpirun -np 2 ./minimal; Rank 0 recvbuf = -42 100 101 ; Rank 1 recvbuf = -42 100 101 ; ```; This is in line with the expected behaviour of `MPI_Allgatherv` described above. For MPICH however, I get:; ```bash; $ mpicxx.mpich minimal.cpp -o minimal; $ mpirun.mpich -np 1 ./minimal; Rank 0 recvbuf = 100 0 ; $ mpirun.mpich -np 2 ./minimal; Rank 0 recvbuf = -42 100 101 ; Rank 1 recvbuf = -42 100 101 ; ```; as if `displs` were ignored for `-np 1`. @pcarruscag Can you confirm this observation?

Availability,"That's not consistent with any code I know, when using the MRF approach you either get frozen rotor or mixing plane interfaces. If you want a more accurate simulation you move the mesh and update the interfaces, there are several advantages to not dealing with the MRF source terms. There are also practical aspects of not updating the interface when doing transient MRF, for example it lets you handle interfaces that are not cylindrical, people use this to model car wheels.; MRF is also less restrictive for time step size than moving mesh, but if you move the interface you bring some of the moving mesh restrictions to MRF.

Availability,"The adjoint handling of the Eigen library can actually be a two step process. In the first step we just use the BlackBox differentiation of Eigen. This will work for every user in the primal code and adjoint code. As a second step we would then look into the BLAS wrapper of Eigen and check if we can provide a special treatment for the adjoint aka CoDiPack version. In general there are two options available:. 1. Wrap the BLAS calls in external functions, requires a lot of manual programming but can be generalized so that it is also available as a general feature of CoDiPack (e.g. We can handle BLAS to XX %). 2. Make use of the ""new"" AD tool I am currently programming. This tool does not insert itself into the Eigen structures, but wraps around them. Then the special path for BLAS can be activated without the AD tool even noticing it.

Availability,"There is sth weird going on with the added inlet regression test. And I got to believe that it has to do with the primitive-container-indexing that took place in #1392 because when I revert to commit fe6ba90aab388ed6d9ff77fa3cb03434fe86654c right before that merge took place everything works fine. Maybe I also did a mistake when porting the CSpeciesSolver to that new structure. I am trying to do a verification of the inlet files by using the written example_inlet_file as input which should result in the very same history as the non-inlet version. I see a difference in Residuals which is sometimes not consistent (I had cases where I cycled through 3 different outcomes for the inlet version in a random order...wtf). It has nothing to do with the wrong values being read in and made available to the Solver, they are perfect. I now did 2 full-time days of debugging and I a don't get it. I have traced the problem down quite a bit and know which code lines I have to comment to make the problem go away ... but it doesnt make sense: I am not allowed (I can, but then I have non-equal diffs) to write anything (but zero!) in certain blocks of the local variable `profileData` in `CMarkerProfileReader`. That is only the case for more than 1 species equation! I also overwrote the `Inlet_Species_Var` using the `SetUnformInlet` which just takes the cfg-Marker values. .

Availability,"These timings were all run this morning on the same cluster. . Using qperf, I'm seeing 80 microsecond latency. I'm also seeing the expected bandwidth using qperf as well. I would think that mpi would behave similarly but 100% sure. . I'm quite sure that the jobs are being launched correctly. I've checked that a bunch of times since that was my first instinct. I've both logged into all the machines and watched top and everything looked normal. And I've tried running SU2 v6 before and after v7, launching them the same way, and I keep getting the same numbers. I'm not sure how to check whether there is any reason non blocking comm would be ineffective. If you have any ideas I can certainly try something. I tried to download vampirtrace which seemingly can profile mpi, but it failed to compile against my version of mpi. When I get the chance I can try a different version of openmpi and see if I can get it running. The networking setup is pretty simple with all 4 machines plugged into the same switch and they share their own vlan as part of a bigger network.

Availability,"This is a very important topic, @jayantmukho. The optimization functionality is very difficult for folks to get working on their own. There are too many options, and it is not user friendly. We need to improve, and I am open to streamlining the interface if you have some ideas. In general, the bevy of options that you nicely describe above have been added over the years in order to coax the scipy SLSQP optimizer into converging, especially with constraints. It has mostly been a trial-and-error process during that time. Most of the tricks involve getting the scaling set such that the SLSQP optimizer does not take any massively errant steps during its line search that cause divergence. I think it would be great to see a standard normalization of the problem (say, make everything on the order of 1 going in/out of the optimizer) and interfaces to new optimizers (this exists already in part in feature_pyopt). In practice, I use **ONLY** the Scale value in OPT_OBJECTIVE and OPT_CONSTRAINT (set to a value that results in a first optimizer step roughly 10% the characteristic length of my geometry), and ignore the options OPT_GRADIENT_FACTOR, OPT_RELAX_FACTOR, and OPT_LINE_SEARCH_BOUND. I sometimes use the OPT_BOUND_UPPER and OPT_BOUND_LOWER options.

Availability,This is now completely general I believe. `geometry->node[iPoint]->GetPoint(index)` always returns the right point either for index 0 or 1 at least in a quad mesh (there are only two neighbours at the corner) and the wrong one equals the normal neighbour. I tried it on a triangular mesh and it worked as well but perhaps it won't always be correct. The worst case is an error equal to the one of setting it to 0.0 and it's just as safe. Setting it to 0.0 is what I did at first but the axis is not a wall in general so it's usually the point with the largest cells and the highest velocities unless it's an Euler case. If there are very few nodes overall on the marker the contribution may not be that small. I suppose looking for the vertices on the axis marker here would be more messy and prone to bugs (and much more work for me),MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/927#issuecomment-611625225:371,error,error,371,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/927#issuecomment-611625225,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"This isn't just a hypothetical problem. In `CSolver::LoadInletProfile`, a specified inlet profile is compared against the loaded grid. Since each MPI task ""owns"" a different section of the grid, you can get errors on one task but not another. Here's the current workaround. The code currently does an `MPI_Allreduce` to check if there were any errors globally, then calls `SU2_MPI::Error` collectively if there were any errors.

Availability,"Tom,. Ok. So 3 Gb and 4 sec to write on 72 cores is about 10.6Mb / sec / core. Since not each core has access to a separate I/O node (assume 8 cores / processor), that would give upwards of 80 Mb / sec / node which is quite respectable. The reading seems a bit slower, but it is indeed a major improvement. Later in time we should do some tests for much larger files to make sure we get some level of scalability. Best,. Juan.

The tricky part of course is how to find out this lowest rank. A possible solution would be (although I am open for alternatives here). - The ranks in the error handler send out messages with a very specific tag to all other ranks.; - The ranks in the error handler attempt to receive messages for a certain amount of time or until all messages have been received. Typically MPI_Iprobe would be used for this purpose.; - Keep track of the lowest rank from which an actual message was received. This may not be very efficient, but you don't care here.

Availability,"Wonderful contribution. Thanks for doing all that. Streamlining the dev process is very helpful and cmake is definitely becoming a standard. Best,. Juan. On Nov 10, 2019, at 11:24 AM, Daumantas Kavolis <notifications@github.com> wrote:. ﻿; Proposed Changes. Added CMake build support for SU2. With this, many popular IDEs will be able to use SU2 as a project with minimal setup. CMake also enables to add dependencies more easily since most libraries have CMake support. vcpkg is great for the libraries available there. SU2 CMake has the same build options as autotools but uses CMake to find system libraries and compilers (MKL, Mutationpp, MPI and Python currently). No longer need to specify paths to compilers/libraries if they are in standard locations. In addition, compile flags can be modified from CMake. There is no need to use preconfigure.py anymore since downloading/unpacking is handled by CMake and is system-agnostic. At the moment, all library targets are static but that could be easily changed to be configurable from CMake. The installation directory is ${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}/bin. Similarly to autotools, some build options are disabled if built with Codi forward/reverse datatypes or without MPI. Note that SWIG fails to compile pySU2ad with Nothing known about namespace 'medi' in Common/include/mpi_structure.hpp:57 without -includeall SWIG option but then it takes forever to generate the wrapper (more than 15 minutes on my machine, stopped early). I suggest removing using namespace declarations and either importing used symbols explicitly with using or prepending namespace name, clang-tidy warns against them by default and it makes the code clearer. SU2 CMake options are:. * Build modules:; * SU2_BUILD_CFD: ON|OFF; * SU2_BUILD_DEF: ON|OFF, disabled when building with Codi; * SU2_BUILD_DOT: ON|OFF, disabled when building with Codi forward; * SU2_BUILD_GEO: ON|OFF, disabled when building with Codi; * SU2_BUILD_MSH: ON|OFF, disabled when building with Codi; * SU2_BUIL",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814#issuecomment-552242380:504,avail,available,504,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814#issuecomment-552242380,4,"['avail', 'down']","['available', 'downloading']"

Availability,"Yeah the config is a bit confusing. The initial CFD run (in adap/ini) uses the value specified in ITER (unless RESTART_SOL= YES, then it runs one iteration just to get force coefficients). . After that, it runs a series of adaptations based on the settings in PYADAP_SUBITE, PYADAP_FLOW_ITER, and PYADAP_COMPLEXITY. . 1. AMG interpolates the solution; 2. A simulation is run for PYADAP_FLOW_ITER[0] iterations (2999 in your case); 3. An adaptation is performed with a target size of PYADAP_COMPLEXITY[0] (20000 in your case). This is done PYADAP_SUBITE[0] times. Then it moves on to the next mesh level. I admit that I haven't really debugged the feature-based (e.g. Mach-based) adaptation much. I found a couple bugs in the python scripts and just updated them, so could you pull again and rerun ninja?. The AMG output is pretty long, but since it's developed at Inria, I don't have any control over that. I guess as long as none of the lines are error statements (usually complaining about invalid projections or negative eigenvalues of the metric from my experience) it should be fine. The only actual information I get from amg.log is usually in the last line; ```; NbSensor 30518 msh->npobk 30518 NbrTyp 19 msh->npoin 52477; ```; which just tells you how many points are in the old vs. new mesh, but you could just look at the .su2 files for that.

Availability,"ZE_SURFACE_DEF= NO ; % Vol; YES=UpwRoe; NO=JST_BC; VISUALIZE_VOLUME_DEF= NO; % YES=JST; NO=see VOLUME_DEF; MUSCL_ADJFLOW= NO; ```; In that branch I added the possibility to run the old or new Euler_Wall BC on `MARKER_EULER `walls (`MARKER_SYM `always uses the the new implementation) using `VISUALIZE_SURFACE_DEF` as a hooked boolean. ; With `VISUALIZE_VOLUME_DEF` one can change which convective scheme is used on the boundary, i.e. what is in the numerics container `CONV_BOUND_TERM`. The Default is `CUpwRoe_Flow` (`ROE`) and I added `CCentJST_Flow_BC` which is the normal `JST` without dissipation. ; The third option `MUSCL_ADJFLOW` has to be left on NO, this is work in progress :) . With the options given above you will use the new Euler wall implementation but using JST without dissipation term as a convective scheme for boundary nodes. This (as I say in point 2. in my above post) basically recovers the old euler wall implementation. . For the OneraM6 case the combination of new Euler + JST_BC recovers the CD & CL results of the old code. Can you also try running `CONV_NUM_METHOD_FLOW= ROE` with the code you labelled as 'SU2 FSI new (new bound condition)' and 'SU2 FSI new (oldbound condition)'. Because by doing so you switch the numerical method in the volume and to the same ROE scheme on the boundary -> just as the current default in the develop. So my current assumption is that it is a matter of convective scheme (on the boundary). ~~I'll try to attach my cases as a zip and two images here.~~; Here the green line represents the current develop if one uses MARKER_EULER or MARKER_SYM. Another info here is: by using the oldEuler wall (i.e. line 1&2) the choice of convective scheme on the boundary is irrelevant for the Euler_wall as the old implementation ""skips"" that step. The red line 4 is the setup I want you to try because this recovers the old results in this case.; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4933860/73058455-fb923880-3e93-11ea-9d49-baf87a47",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/828#issuecomment-578048838:1239,recover,recovers,1239,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/828#issuecomment-578048838,1,['recover'],['recovers']
Availability,"[...]; > If either you or @frx-wintermute are interested in complementing the feature by adding an option to prefer system libraries (via pkg-config, no paths because 99.9% of users will not know what to do) instead of the versions shipped with SU2, please go ahead and open a PR. Hello @pcarruscag!. To be honest, my daydream is: I would love to see SU2 shipping nothing in 'externals/' (or just empty subdirectories such as 'externals/meson/' ); then those external dependencies are by default downloaded from external repositories or tar archives. This defaul behavior would be obtained by configuring with the './meson.py' script and then by building with './ninja'. But, if a user wants to build SU2 from source and prefers to use system-wide Meson and Ninja and system-wide versions of the external dependencies, it would be possible to avoid downloading these external dependencies. By running './preconfigure.py' with appropriate options, it would be possible to decide which external dependencies to **not** download. At that point, system-wide Meson and Ninja could be used to build SU2 from source. And the 'meson.build' file would do the following:. * for each required or enabled (at configure time) dependency **\<foo\>**, it would check whether it is found in 'externals/**\<foo\>**/'; if not, it would check whether it can be found as a system-wide installation (perhaps via pkgconfig); if not, it would exit with error; * for each dependency which is not required nor enabled at configure time, it would avoid using it at all. I think this daydream is achievable, and I hope that other people consider it as a useful goal.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2086#issuecomment-1646970778:496,down,downloaded,496,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/2086#issuecomment-1646970778,4,"['down', 'error']","['download', 'downloaded', 'downloading', 'error']"

That whole debugging experience was total garbage because the whole problem is super flaky where I feel I cannot rely on the problem to show up consistently and seemingly unrelated changes shift the whole problem... my favorite was: at some point I got the classic `FGMRES diverged` thing at the simulation start -> I thought lets go and check for NAN's and comment in fenv -> with the two additonal lines commented in + compiled the problem was gone -> ok, well revert the change and test again -> Problem Still gone and not seen again UNTIL i look at what the github regression test do because there it shows up again whereas I can run that no problem locally. ; I dont know what to do about this, I tried quite a few things withou",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1388#issuecomment-968058603:5664,error,error,5664,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1388#issuecomment-968058603,1,['error'],['error']

I tried to compare the same case but steady (I attach the summary). Results in this case are fairly similar and (in my opinion) raise no warnings. That is good to hear. ; Luckily @cvencro (Thanks for that 👍 ) ran some tests and found that #740 (which rewrites Euler Wall boundaries for compressible and incompressible flows ... which was me btw) introduces the changes you see. The Euler wall for compressible is changed a bit in the way the boundary condition is enforced. Upon convergence both version should recover (close to) the same value. If the results in a steady state are the same/very-similar and if an unsteady simulation at low enough Reynolds-number converges to the same steady result (or oscillate in the same bounds) -> I would say it is simply some purely numerical effect based on the unphysical initialization and different treatment of the euler wall boundary. . 1 thing one could test additionally is to force a very high convergence in each physical timestep, i.e. usually one converges ~3 orders of magnitude in each ts -> now try converging until residual stalling in each ts. If the code versions get the same/closer results in the temporal evolution my euler wall boundary explanation would be quite reasonable.; Together with the long running unsteady simulation proposed above, I would feel more comfortable to judge. @cvencro (bringing the conversation to this place 😉 ) concerning the pitching case: the `if (dynamic_grid)` statements in the 'old' version are not necessary as that is handled by the numerics class. In the new version an appropriate 'reflected state' is constructed and the numerics container is called to compute the residual. Before, the code of one numerics ->ComputeResidual Routine was simply copied and slightly modified. But of course there is always room for errors 🐛 .

Availability,"ch request to make it clearer. Request: Use nomenclature consistent with the C++ interface (point instead of node, etc.); Reason: People who know the C++ interface will know how to use the python wrapper straight away, people who learn how to use the python wrapper will be able to understand the C++ implementation (without needing a translation layer in their mind all the time). Request: Return connectivity/adjacency as local indices instead of global; Reason: This is the natural way of referencing data in an MPI code, local indices correspond directly to data stored in the partition thereby making it more efficient to access (without global-to-local conversions, which are much more expensive than local-to-global). Furthermore, the local ordering strategy improves the efficiency of loops (over edges, neighboring points, etc.). Request: Do not apply unnecessary ""transformations"" to the connectivity/adjacency as part of the API; Reason: Increases the maintenance burden and makes for a less versatile API. By returning the local indices that form a marker or element, it is trivial to retrieve any other data for those indices (the ""transformation""). For example, the solution at those points, the point coordinates, whether the points are halo or domain points, the global indices, etc.; This way, by adding a **single** function to the API e.g. get the global index of a point of element, the functionality of the API grows a lot more because the user can apply the function to **any** connectivity/adjacency function. Request: Do not offer too many overloads of the same function; Reason: Increases the maintenance burden and it's returning the data in structures that are not very efficient, namely vector of vectors. It is much easier to offer domain-wide data access on the python side, as a very small function that can be part of wrapper utilities (i.e. live only in python but not c++).

Availability,"ed the linear solvers stay the same and routines that are light see more speedup than their arithmetic-intensive friends.; What is surprising to me is how intensive the convective residuals appear to be with only a 7% improvement, so surprising in fact, I do not think the above paints the full picture. Maybe the outlet bandwidth bottleneck (into the Jacobian matrix) is more important.; To put that do the test I switched to Euler-explicit time marching and repeated the measurements:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38071223/63293351-d8010b80-c2bf-11e9-8135-2502eac1128e.png); Better, but not by much, which means upwind and viscous residuals computations might gain a lot from vectorization (SIMD). And like @economon mentioned even more if they are somehow fused together.; It also means the writes to CSysMatrix are relatively expensive, I think there are two-three reasons for it.; - We do a linear search on each Add/SubtractBlock - This could be replaced by a map.; - The Jacobian contributions are first written into a temporary block - Interleaving the writes with the computation could help mask latency.; - That temporary is not stored contiguously - Which makes it hard to vectorize the writes to CSysMatrix. **So what do I think should be tackled next?**; Hybrid parallelism (wait what?!) from messing about with this case (and more refined versions) it is clear the MG puts some limits on how many cores can be used before it stops being able to produce coarse grids, both in number and quality. Going to an MPI+Threads strategy would move that limit by one order of magnitude, giving us some robustness and performance for folks hoping to rely on strong scaling.

If someone wanted to try using PCL for this, that would be quite interesting. Given the open source license, as Tom mentions, there should not be a problem interfacing with SU2. Now, an issue we faced in the ASC / PSAAP programs is that for extremely large calculations, the surface mesh (to be searched for minimum distance calculations) may actually not fit in a single processor. For that purpose we built parallel ADTs in the past (unfortunately in FORTRAN90) which replicate a small portion of the upper structure of the tree in all processors (without consuming a lot of memory) and then decomposed the tree into the various processors participating in the searches. While the parallel speedups / efficiencies were not earth-shattering, we did manage to overcome the memory bottlenecks. Does anyone know if PCL can also handle trees that are decomposed in parallel? Would PCL work with its own MPI communicator and automate the communication needed for the searches?. Cheers,. Juan. On Jun 5, 2016, at 4:06 AM, Thomas D.

Availability,"entation) using `VISUALIZE_SURFACE_DEF` as a hooked boolean. ; With `VISUALIZE_VOLUME_DEF` one can change which convective scheme is used on the boundary, i.e. what is in the numerics container `CONV_BOUND_TERM`. The Default is `CUpwRoe_Flow` (`ROE`) and I added `CCentJST_Flow_BC` which is the normal `JST` without dissipation. ; The third option `MUSCL_ADJFLOW` has to be left on NO, this is work in progress :) . With the options given above you will use the new Euler wall implementation but using JST without dissipation term as a convective scheme for boundary nodes. This (as I say in point 2. in my above post) basically recovers the old euler wall implementation. . For the OneraM6 case the combination of new Euler + JST_BC recovers the CD & CL results of the old code. Can you also try running `CONV_NUM_METHOD_FLOW= ROE` with the code you labelled as 'SU2 FSI new (new bound condition)' and 'SU2 FSI new (oldbound condition)'. Because by doing so you switch the numerical method in the volume and to the same ROE scheme on the boundary -> just as the current default in the develop. So my current assumption is that it is a matter of convective scheme (on the boundary). ~~I'll try to attach my cases as a zip and two images here.~~; Here the green line represents the current develop if one uses MARKER_EULER or MARKER_SYM. Another info here is: by using the oldEuler wall (i.e. line 1&2) the choice of convective scheme on the boundary is irrelevant for the Euler_wall as the old implementation ""skips"" that step. The red line 4 is the setup I want you to try because this recovers the old results in this case.; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4933860/73058455-fb923880-3e93-11ea-9d49-baf87a4754e6.png); ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4933860/73058476-0351dd00-3e94-11ea-8498-37ccfdb033b0.png).

Availability,"es are definitely validation cases too. We can continue to add test cases to the TestCases repo, knowing that only a subset of those cases belong in the V&V list. 2. An important aspect of the V&V is the convergence of the solution as the mesh is refined. As Jayant knows well, this can help us catch bugs. This means that a well-constructed V&V suite needs to include a series of meshes (of increasing density), the corresponding configuration files, and the actual experimental data (or other numerical data from runs on different solvers). I strongly agree with the suggestions made that (a) the entire V&V suite needs to be run before every major release (with configuration files updated), (b) that this should be linked form the main SU2 page, (c) that the 2014 AIAA paper (and Tom’s AVIATION 2018 paper) should serve as a starting point, (d) that the NASA TMR website can give us ideas of additional access, and (e) that the SU2 V&V page should be managed within GitHub.com<http://GitHub.com> so the entire community can edit / add to this / these page/s to continue to grow the number of cases and their relevance.

As you mention, we would have to work out the logistics as this would require quite a bit of implication from the community, but the extra burden on the release would be compensated by avoiding big ""updating"" operations every now and then.

Availability,"f501dc168cd7ef4a4d1f81140a0959a9d4382128 fixes divergence of the `disc_adj_fsi` case among the parallel regression tests that occurred when using the CoDiPack type `RealReverseIndex` instead of `RealReverse`. Since the bug is not obvious from the commit and there might be a better way to fix this, let me put this up for discussion. In `CDiscAdjMultizoneDriver::SetRecording`, the tape is recorded part by part. The part of the code that is at fault involves three of them.; - `DEPENDENCIES -> OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION`: an index is last used on a right hand side; - `OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION -> TRANSFER`: the index is available for reuse and used on the left hand side; - `recording for a zone`: the index is used on a right hand side. In `CDiscAdjMultizoneDriver.cpp::ComputeAdjoints`, however, the `TRANSFER -> OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION` part of the evaluation is skipped in some cases. After the `recording for a zone` evaluation accumulated adjoints for the said index, the adjoint reset that would be performed in the skipped tape part is missing. Instead, the tape evaluation `DEPENDENCIES -> OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION` receives the adjoints for this index, which is wrong because the index is associated with a different primal variable in this part of the tape. Have there been issues regarding dependencies between tape parts previously? Are there mechanisms established that address such issues?. If someone wants to give it a try, I added a build option for the tape type in 183c3ca7a3235c8293cf2242c66c82d35a3922c7.

Switch to a [virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). This will ensure that all of your python packages are stored in single location. #### Alternate workaround. In this method, you change the hardcoded includes to match mpi4py's package location. First I figure out where my mpi4py is installed. I start a terminal session of python using the python environment I want to use (in this case, it's python 3.6), and then run:; ```; from mpi4py import MPI; MPI; ```. Since I have mpi4py installed on your system and it's on my python path, I see something like:; ```; <module 'mpi4py.MPI' from '/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mpi4py/MPI.cpython-34m.so'>; ```. The `/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python3.6/` directory is where my mpi4py package is installed. But the swig compile command includes `/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python2.7/`. That's not the right directory! So first I find the hardcoded paths of the makefile by running (on a bash terminal):; ```; grep -rn python2\.7 SU2_PY/ ; ```; On my system, this prints out four lines. I don't care about the `Makefile.in` files, because those are generated automatically and will be overwritten every time I run ""configure"" or ""preconfigure.py."" The `NUMPY_INCLUDE` line is also commented out, so I ignore that too. That leaves me with one line, line 51 of `SU2_PY/pySU2/Makefile.am`:. ```; SU2_PY/pySU2/Makefile.am:51:MPI4PY_INCLUDE = ${HOME}/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mpi4py/include \; ```. I now modify line 51 of Makefile.am to read:. ```; MPI4PY_INCLUDE = ${HOME}/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mpi4py/include \; ```. Then run configure or preconfigure.py again, and then run make again. You should be good to go!. #### tl;dr.

Running the edge-loop version on 4 cores (8192 group + sorting) we get speedups (relative to reference) of **1.98** and **2.04** for the scalar and SIMD versions respectively (yes I quadruple checked).; If you are keeping track of the number two things should surprise you, the first is that there is no difference between scalar and SIMD now (the vector instruction are still there though), the second is that 4 cores give only a 2x speedup. The reason for both is: the implementation is very memory-bound, and so throwing more compute at it, either in the form of more cores or more lanes, does not help much. This is the 4 core summary:. | Code | Edge | Edge, SIMD on vars | Point | Point, SIMD on points |; | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |; | **Speed** | 2.0 | 2.0 | 3.8 | 2.8 |. I think the point-based versions scale better because they are a bit less memory-bound as they write to the gradient sequentially and they have a bit more compute due to the duplicated computations. **Conclusion**; Computing gradients via point-loops allows simpler and more generic SIMD and SPMD strategies, the resulting implementation seems to do better in the bandwidth-starved conditions typical of modern hardware (3 or more cores per memory channel). However, additional adjacency information is required to support point-based loops. Next I will talk about limiters, almost all concepts are introduced so it will be shorter (promise). As a little appetizer let me tell you we can recover the extra memory and we could be looking at a 2.7x speedup for gradients+limiters.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-530328194:15713,recover,recover,15713,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-530328194,2,['recover'],['recover']

With the symmetry plane, the results differ from the other inviscid solutions but the agreement to the experiment is better. I couldn't get hold of reference drag or moment results to compare against, therefore the comparison is only against lift. I also tested the pitching NACA 0012 airfoil using Batina's ""Unsteady Euler Airfoil Solutions Using Unstructured Dynamic Meshes"" as reference.

As a final test I ran the rotating frame case, again from @economon 's thesis which is a steady problem with simulated grid motion. I was able to run and replicate the flow characteristics using the Euler wall boundary condition but with symmetry plane the residuals were straightaway at machine precision and the flow never develops around the airfoil.

Availability,"iating tests, grouping tests into suites, and running checks. This choice was based on what is available in our development setup. We have integrated our unit tests into our Travis CI regression testing. Every time we push commits or submit a pull request, the unit tests are run and checked. What is my vision for unit testing in SU2?. I am not proposing that we start trying to get 100% code coverage with pre-existing code. That would not provide a good return on investment. Instead, I see people adding unit tests as they write new code and as they find bugs. For each new behavior added to SU2, tests are first added to document the related existing behavior. These tests serve to check that the existing behavior isn't damaged by the new code. Then new tests are added to prove that the new behavior is working correctly. For bug fixes, the process is simpler. A test is added to confirm that something is not behaving as expected. Then the code is fixed to make the test pass. What frameworks are available?. For a unit testing framework, here are the most popular options, with the following pros and cons:. Roll-your-own. * Requires no external dependencies; * The most flexible option; * Involves the most work to setup; * Will lack some of the more advances features of mature unit-testing frameworks. Boost Test. * Can be header only, statically linked, or dynamically linked; * If statically or dynamically linked, then Boost is not very lightweight; * Easy to add if you're already using Boost. Google Test. * Most common unit-testing framework; * Can be easily combined with Google's powerful GMock mocking library; * Compiling and linking can be somewhat painful. Catch2. * Used by FEniCS; * Makes unit tests easily readable with lots of syntactic sugar.; * Has a very simple syntax; * Is header-only; * Requires C++11 compilation; * Not as feature rich as Google Test or Boost Test. Questions. * How do developers feel about adding unit tests to SU2?; * If a unit-testing framework ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/698#issuecomment-499250240:4254,avail,available,4254,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/698#issuecomment-499250240,2,['avail'],['available']

This error typically indicates a syntax problem, such as having multiple options on a single line without proper separation by an equal sign (=). However, upon reviewing _adap/ini/config_CFD.cfg_, was unable to find any lines that clearly violated this syntax rule. Could this error be indicative of a more subtle issue within the configuration file, or might it be related to specific aspects of the feature_adap branch?

Availability,"irst;; size_t jPoint = connectivity[iEdge].second;; ```; Apologies for the macro but it is just to illustrate that if we re-sort edge data after coloring the edge index is the loop index, otherwise the edge indices for each color need to be stored in a separate array.; Note that for each edge loop we first loop over colors, then over same-color edges, it is this inner loop that can run in parallel in chunk sizes that are multiple of the group size considered during coloring. There is some runtime cost on entry to every #omp parallel section, with coloring we enter one such section once by color. I mentioned in the introduction coloring reduces locality and therefore performance, here is the effect of color group size on the execution time of the scalar code on one thread:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38071223/64686801-2e0d3d00-d481-11e9-82a0-c56e5554cd83.png); The hassle-free option of not sorting by color ""never"" recovers the performance of the base algorithm, things are even worse for the SIMD version where even at group size of 8192 with re-sorting the slowdown is 14%. Running the edge-loop version on 4 cores (8192 group + sorting) we get speedups (relative to reference) of **1.98** and **2.04** for the scalar and SIMD versions respectively (yes I quadruple checked).; If you are keeping track of the number two things should surprise you, the first is that there is no difference between scalar and SIMD now (the vector instruction are still there though), the second is that 4 cores give only a 2x speedup. The reason for both is: the implementation is very memory-bound, and so throwing more compute at it, either in the form of more cores or more lanes, does not help much. This is the 4 core summary:. | Code | Edge | Edge, SIMD on vars | Point | Point, SIMD on points |; | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |; | **Speed** | 2.0 | 2.0 | 3.8 | 2.8 |.

Availability,"p size is wildly varying depending on the optimization objectives/constraints, scales of the geometry, and types/numbers of design variables that are being used. You have to play this game of scaling the objectives and constraints in different ways to coax out the ideal first step. In my limited testing, the value of 1E-6 for the gradient norm seems to work well for 3D RANS aerodynamic shape optimizations of an aircraft wing when using FFD control points to change the shape of the wing. This is a specific use case that was the subject of a lot of the underlying research that resulted in the shape optimization framework. Which is likely why I have had good results using this rule of thumb. . > Is 1E-6 a good rule? Or is it just a decent starting point, and values very different from 1E-6 are used in practice? Also, if this is ""a good rule,"" then shouldn't we just automatically rescale the problem after the first design iteration?. Scaling in an optimization problem can be pretty frustrating and time consuming. Anecdotally, I have been using @economon 's suggestions of leaving everything else as default (value of 1) and only playing with the objective and constraint scalings to get a good first step size. As mentioned before, this step size is of different values for different problems, which is why it is difficult to come up with universal scalings that would work for most problems. But I am hoping to address some of these scaling issues in #923 . . I haven't really found much good literature on this problem, but I might be looking in the wrong places. Recommendations are welcome. . A big boon is having a robust solver. If it can handle flow simulations with odd geometries, you need to do less parameter tweaking. The reason you need good scaling is so that the optimizer doesn't explore difficult parts of the design space. If the simulation diverges, the optimization fails. Some intelligent handling of simulation divergences would also help the optimization framework.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/733#issuecomment-616810829:2007,robust,robust,2007,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/733#issuecomment-616810829,1,['robust'],['robust']

Availability,"r today. During the output of the periodic mesh in `SU2_MSH`, `CPeriodicGeometry::SetMeshFile` sorts the nodes into the order normal, receive, send. This can be found in [lines 18798-18819 of Common/src/geometry_structure](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/blob/68991cd1005cf118e1ff21b8952bb366bb299cf3/Common/src/geometry_structure.cpp#L18798). I've copied down the lines here for reference:. ```cpp; /*--- Change the numbering to guarantee that the all the receive; points are at the end of the file ---*/; unsigned long OldnPoint = geometry->GetnPoint();; unsigned long *NewSort = new unsigned long[nPoint];; for (iPoint = 0; iPoint < nPoint; iPoint++) {; NewSort[iPoint] = iPoint;; }; ; unsigned long Index = OldnPoint-1;; for (iMarker = 0; iMarker < nMarker; iMarker++) {; if (bound[iMarker][0]->GetVTK_Type() == VERTEX) {; if (config->GetMarker_All_SendRecv(iMarker) < 0) {; for (iElem_Bound = 0; iElem_Bound < nElem_Bound[iMarker]; iElem_Bound++) {; if (bound[iMarker][iElem_Bound]->GetNode(0) < geometry->GetnPoint()) {; NewSort[bound[iMarker][iElem_Bound]->GetNode(0)] = Index;; NewSort[Index] = bound[iMarker][iElem_Bound]->GetNode(0);; Index--;; }; }; }; }; }; ```. In order to sort the points, a list mapping the old points to the new points (`NewSort`) is created. The problem is that this list is sorted by switching nodes. But it doesn't switch around the _contents_ of the list (i.e. two node numbers from the list). Instead it switched an index from the list and an actual node number pulled from the geometry. This presents two problems:. 1. If any of the receive nodes actually are at the end of the list, they will get switched away from the end of the list.; 2. If any node is switched twice, data is lost. That's because the sorting assumes that the elements being switched have not already been switched. This is how the three points went missing from the cube problem I previously referenced.

Availability,"rite-unit-tests-for-scientific-research-codes>. What do I propose?. My research group at UT Austing has implemented a unit testing framework on our branch, which we're happy with. Some choices were arbitrary, and some choices were made based on our development environment. Those choices may be different for other groups. Here's what we have done:. The unit testing framework is compiled and run using autotools. For more information on autotool's setup, see their documentation<https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Tests.html>. Since autotools is the build system for SU2, this involves minimal changes. Using automake, the build process for building unit tests becomes:. '''; ./bootstrap; ./configure; make; make check; '''. We use Boost's unit testing framework<https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html>. This provides a convenient set of macros for instatiating tests, grouping tests into suites, and running checks. This choice was based on what is available in our development setup. We have integrated our unit tests into our Travis CI regression testing. Every time we push commits or submit a pull request, the unit tests are run and checked. What is my vision for unit testing in SU2?. I am not proposing that we start trying to get 100% code coverage with pre-existing code. That would not provide a good return on investment. Instead, I see people adding unit tests as they write new code and as they find bugs. For each new behavior added to SU2, tests are first added to document the related existing behavior. These tests serve to check that the existing behavior isn't damaged by the new code. Then new tests are added to prove that the new behavior is working correctly. For bug fixes, the process is simpler. A test is added to confirm that something is not behaving as expected. Then the code is fixed to make the test pass. What frameworks are available?.

The Default is `CUpwRoe_Flow` (`ROE`) and I added `CCentJST_Flow_BC` which is the normal `JST` without dissipation. ; The third option `MUSCL_ADJFLOW` has to be left on NO, this is work in progress :) . With the options given above you will use the new Euler wall implementation but using JST without dissipation term as a convective scheme for boundary nodes. This (as I say in point 2. in my above post) basically recovers the old euler wall implementation. . For the OneraM6 case the combination of new Euler + JST_BC recovers the CD & CL results of the old code. Can you also try running `CONV_NUM_METHOD_FLOW= ROE` with the code you labelled as 'SU2 FSI new (new bound condition)' and 'SU2 FSI new (oldbound condition)'. Because by doing so you switch the numerical method in the volume and to the same ROE scheme on the boundary -> just as the current default in the develop. So my current assumption is that it is a matter of convective scheme (on the boundary). ~~I'll try to attach my cases as a zip and two images here.~~; Here the green line represents the current develop if one uses MARKER_EULER or MARKER_SYM.

Availability,"s nowadays, so we should always be improving the class design accordingly. I suppose this will just get more important with adding more physics, zones, and more complex time integration schemes. I would like to highlight that when the code was first released, we did not have ""zones"" at all (not until some early sliding mesh work after a couple of versions), and the CDriver and CIteration classes didn't even exist until we dreamed them up a couple of years ago. My point is that, with some proper planning, we have the creativity and the right team to develop the solution we need, and we shouldn't be afraid to make big changes when necessary. Moving quickly while leveraging the team's broad skillset is one of our biggest advantages in this project. As you all know, over the years, we continue to move toward a *_structure.cpp and *_physics.cpp mindset for how we do our abstractions/data encapsulations, with ""structure"" components reused and ""physics"" components being specialized to a certain set of governing equations. This has happened in many places, including recently with the CTransfer class, for instance, and it is likely to happen with the COutput class(es) before long. However, one area where there hasn't been much evolution is within the CIntegration classes. Apart from a couple of additions for structural problems and now the DG integration, it is largely the same as it was in the first release. Perhaps this is our opportunity to rethink and update these classes for future expansion, just as we've done for others over the years. We could rework them, move them up or down in the hierarchy, change where they're instantiated, change the inheritance, and so on. Even if they get a little more complicated (like usual), as long as they're properly abstracted, it isn't likely to bother the developers working in other areas of the code too much. In short, I think some effort spent on the CIntegration classes could help here, and they are due for some updates anyway.

Availability,"t involves installing the desired python version with `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install <version>`. To recap, a ""workflow for newbies"" which appears to be working for me is. 1. install pyenv either from [source](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) or from your distibution repositories, if available. IMPORTANT: make sure the environment variables are correctly set and `pyenv init` is added to your shell, as per the installation instructions.; 2. install the desired python version (for example 3.7.8), enabling shared libraries: ; `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install 3.7.8`; 3. clone/download the [feature_adap](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/feature_adap) branch of SU2;; 4. in the SU2 folder, configure meson ; `./meson.py build` ; and make sure to update the environment variables in your `.bashrc` as indicated by meson's output.; 5. use ninja to build and install SU2 ; `./ninja -C build install`;; if you run into a permission error, specify an installation directory passing the `--prefix` option to meson, as explained [here](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2-installation/227676-su-installation-failed-due-insufficient-permissions.html). These passages, at least for me, result in a running SU2 with mesh adaptation, although I have made no tests on running actual simulations. That being said, the involvement of pyenv is due to the fact that the provided python wheel for pyamg is for python 3.7 only. If I understand correctly, the library itself is proprietary, sadly, so I assume @bmunguia has access either to the source files or to someone who can package them. Depending on the actual compatibility of the code, it would be nice if the wheel was updated to the latest python version, or at least the dependency on 3.7.* was removed. . @chesiv you can also try checking the logs in the `log.err` and `log.out` files to see if anything has gone wrong.

Availability,"t normal (and a tangent to this normal) the current implementation of BC_Sym cannot be ""exploited"" to serve as an ""inviscid (slip) wall"" for non-straight markers. Using `MARKER_EULER= ( sym )` is not correct either as the gradients of the velocity components (used in the viscous stress tensor of the momentum equations) are not computed correctly for the reflected state. Although using MARKER_EULER in the current develop will give you the same results as the master (or older develop before #657 ) with MARKER_SYM (... as it uses the same implementation). If you pull the ""Preprocessing"" part from the develop Sym_BC into the loop over all vertices of the boundary marker, the unit normal (and tangential) gets recomputed for each vertex. That gives you results which should be a lot closer to what happens in the master. Plus handling the velocity gradient correctly. From my point of view this would be the correct way.; Apply this patch in the root of the latest develop code using `patch -p1 < SymAsInviscidSlipWall.diff` to get the code I mean. [SymAsInviscidSlipWall.diff.txt](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/files/3417354/SymAsInviscidSlipWall.diff.txt). The implementation of the Symmetry_BC could serve double as 'Inviscid (slip) wall' (which is prescribed in the NASA documents) for viscous flow if the 'Preprocessing' part gets recomputed for each boundary vertex. But how to integrate that best is s.th. to discuss. One could just pull it in at some higher computational cost, put a conditional together with a boolean (e.g. SYMMETRY_AS_SLIP_WALL= YES) or fixing and using MARKER_EULER for that case. I hope that clarifies what happens with that boundary. Please let me know if that works for you and fixes the issue. When I fixed the Regression Testcases for #657 i think that this one was not part of it, right? Maybe this validation case goes into the su2code/VandV repo :) . Cheers,Tobi.

Availability,"t trickier: the latest 2D results of @RoccoBombardieri show pretty much no difference including the first timesteps. The onera m6 case in contrast converges to the same (steady-state) results for both code version eventually but their initial transient phase differs quite significantly. . A possible explanation for the different initial transient phase: In both implementations a ""reflected state"" is constructed where the normal component of the velocity is subtracted [once in the older code version & twice in the newer version]. I.e. subtracting the normal component of velocity twice means mirroring the velocity along the symmetry plane. The newer code version is a bit ""stronger"" in enforcing the boundary conditions which could lead to the reduced oscillation in CD and CL. If we agree that both code versions produce physically correct results for steady cases and unsteady cases that were integrated long enough in time to get rid of the influence of the initial condition ... then we are left with this initial transient phase that differs. Of course if there is more evidence that one or the other version produces physically ""better"" results I would love to see that. Until then, both initial oscillations are equally correct/uncorrect in my opinion. [I'll add a few words about the adjoint here later]. [I'll add the idea of an FSI case of @cvencro here later where the initial phase has a major impact]; Consider an FSI computation of an airfoil where the trailing edge can exhibit flutter (periodic up-and-down-movement of the trailing edge) in certain flow regimes. Now if during the initial transient the forces on the airfoil are higher than in the converged state then the fluttering can be excited where the initial transient can be seen as an activation energy. If you were to e.g. ramp up flow speed/conditions slowly up to the same magnitude as before one might end up without fluttering. So based on the flow history there might exist multiple ""stable"" states.

Availability,"this is a very nice contribution.. we’re working on the regressions and will pull this in once we have everything straightened out (and this branch passes). In the meantime, you got me thinking: the scale, rotate, translate options might be confusing now if a user doesn’t know whether to include the markers or not. Perhaps this is a chance for separating some of the “design” options from “mesh” options. One way I could see us do this is by moving the implementation I had just committed for the “volume” scale, rotate, and translate options over into the SU2_MSH executable, which might be a more logical home for it. However, this would require adding an extra set of config options for reading in a scale/rotate/translate options for SU2_MSH. The nice thing here is that we keep the intent separate, i.e., only design variables are listed with the other design variables while the mesh transformations are elsewhere. A different, possibly simpler way would be to just create separate names for these two types in the list of available options so that there is no ambiguity. Any thoughts?.

Availability,"to be bandwidth-bound, vectorization helps a bit there too (instructions are also data that needs to travel to the CPU) (maybe for explicit schemes and 8 SIMD lanes, maybe). **Relation with data structures**; There is only one efficient way to move data between memory and registers, via `load` and `store` instructions (they do come in multiple flavors). That is, pointing to a memory location and reading or writing N elements of contiguous data.; It is not the only way, it is also possible to `gather` and `scatter` data. That is populating the register from non-contiguous locations and vice versa. This is about one order of magnitude slower, to the point where if the computations are very simple it may not pay-off to vectorize. **Relation with algorithms**; Some form of `gather` and `scatter` is required in unstructured CFD, which means SIMD has a price of admission. Some thought needs to go into designing algorithms that amortize that cost by maximizing the so called FLOP/Byte ratio, and mask the latency of those operations by being able to start computing as soon as the first element of data is available. **What elements should we try to process simultaneously?**; The choice is between multiple geometric primitives (edges/points) or multiple solution primitives (variables). The latter sounds like a sensible idea until we get to areas of the code where different primitives require different treatment, that and the fact that the number of variables might not fit evenly in the number of lanes can lead to very tricky and non-generic code. Nevertheless if the same code were to be applied to e.g. 4 solution variables, this strategy would likely perform better as it avoids the pesky gather/scatter operations.; Processing multiple geometric primitives can make full utilization of whatever register size (important on GPU's), the code is just as readable (as I hope to show), but gather/scatter cannot be avoided. ### Intro to SPMD; This one is simpler, in a nutshell multiple t",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-529662724:1923,mask,mask,1923,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-529662724,4,"['avail', 'mask']","['available', 'mask']"

I do not have a concrete design in mind yet but I hope to be able to do something akin to the *decorator* pattern I mentioned before. I also plan to make the numerics a full-fledged *visitor* to reduce compilation dependencies, currently a change to numerics may affect CVariable CSolver and CNumerics (as mentioned by @clarkpede), CSolver is involved because it is responsible for fetching data, I may move that to CNumerics, which would let them fetch data as needed.; - Lookup accesses to CSysMatrix to avoid linear searches, the small increase in memory usage can be mitigated by sharing these lookup tables/arrays and the sparsity pattern between matrices associated with the same geometry (on the subject of these lookup tables, ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-539523312:2900,mainten,maintenance,2900,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-539523312,1,['mainten'],['maintenance']

Availability,"👍 for doing this @maxaehle . ; - I am in favor of removing the `_ADJ_` options with the `GRAD_OBJFUNC_FILENAME`.; - As Roe is used the `JST_SENSOR_COEFF` can go. Limiter are turned off so either the slope limiter section with 2 options can be removed or be moved down below the `FLOW NUMERICAL METHOD DEFNITION`.; - `CONV_CRITERIA` will be gone once you merge develop and you can add `CONV_FIELD=RMS_DENSITY` as that is also the default. Removign the `_CAUCHY_` options is prob debatable, but in this very cfg they are unused. ; - The `CFL_ADAPT*` stuff can go (unless the values are chosen in such a way by you that they do work well, otherwise it might even do negative advertisement for an option). I guess I am also a bit aggressive on stripping options from files, so take it with a grain of salt 🧂 . Another aspect ,which is of course nothing to be changed in this PR and is also a bit off-topic, is that lists like `SOLVER` change over time but the list in the comment over the option in the Testcase cfg does not get updated (there might of course be good examples of people doing so ;) ). `WAVE_EQUATION` and `POISSON_EQUATION` e.g. are not available anymore, yet they are in the cfg description of `SOLVER` here... and 200 other Testcases.

Deployability," (should be your 3.7.8) and try `import pyamg` in the shell. If the ""No such file or directory"" error shows up, it means pyamg was not correctly installed; otherwise it is in fact installed. In the latter case, you can check if your python is configured to enable shared libraries. To do it, according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23201498/how-to-check-if-python3-was-built-with-enable-shared), in the python shell you can type ; `import sysconfig`; `sysconfig.get_config_vars('Py_ENABLE_SHARED')`; If the result is `[0]`, ie ""False"", you have to build python with the option `--enable-shared`. ; Now, I don't know how to do accomplish that with conda, but with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) it involves installing the desired python version with `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install <version>`. To recap, a ""workflow for newbies"" which appears to be working for me is. 1. install pyenv either from [source](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) or from your distibution repositories, if available. IMPORTANT: make sure the environment variables are correctly set and `pyenv init` is added to your shell, as per the installation instructions.; 2. install the desired python version (for example 3.7.8), enabling shared libraries: ; `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install 3.7.8`; 3. clone/download the [feature_adap](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/feature_adap) branch of SU2;; 4. in the SU2 folder, configure meson ; `./meson.py build` ; and make sure to update the environment variables in your `.bashrc` as indicated by meson's output.; 5. use ninja to build and install SU2 ; `./ninja -C build install`;; if you run into a permission error, specify an installation directory passing the `--prefix` option to meson, as explained [here](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2-installation/227676-su-installation-failed-due-insufficient-permissions.html).

It is just added to compute some interesting quantity one. So the Nearfield marker needs to be in the mesh right, at the end like all other boundary markers?

Am i correct with that, if not please enlighten me what is actually happening :); > ; > Yes, nearfield marker is just used to extract required physical quantities and should not alter the usual solution process at all. There should be no discrepancies between nearfield marker nodes and mesh nodes. I haven't checked this part of the code for a while but if I remember correctly, the ""Bad match..."" message is shown if there is discrepancy between a nearfield marker node and the nearest mesh node that is NOT on nearfield boundary. I did more investigations. This ""Bad match..."" message is output in `CPhysicalGeometry::MatchNearField` and this function has `SetDonorPoint`. However, currently there is no `GetDonorPoint` except for periodic boundary condition. I don't believe this is used any more.

Deployability," can check if your python is configured to enable shared libraries. To do it, according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23201498/how-to-check-if-python3-was-built-with-enable-shared), in the python shell you can type ; `import sysconfig`; `sysconfig.get_config_vars('Py_ENABLE_SHARED')`; If the result is `[0]`, ie ""False"", you have to build python with the option `--enable-shared`. ; Now, I don't know how to do accomplish that with conda, but with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) it involves installing the desired python version with `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install <version>`. To recap, a ""workflow for newbies"" which appears to be working for me is. 1. install pyenv either from [source](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) or from your distibution repositories, if available. IMPORTANT: make sure the environment variables are correctly set and `pyenv init` is added to your shell, as per the installation instructions.; 2. install the desired python version (for example 3.7.8), enabling shared libraries: ; `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install 3.7.8`; 3. clone/download the [feature_adap](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/feature_adap) branch of SU2;; 4. in the SU2 folder, configure meson ; `./meson.py build` ; and make sure to update the environment variables in your `.bashrc` as indicated by meson's output.; 5. use ninja to build and install SU2 ; `./ninja -C build install`;; if you run into a permission error, specify an installation directory passing the `--prefix` option to meson, as explained [here](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2-installation/227676-su-installation-failed-due-insufficient-permissions.html). These passages, at least for me, result in a running SU2 with mesh adaptation, although I have made no tests on running actual simulations.

Deployability," per rank participates in the message passing, I have no experience here though so this might be a bad strategy, idk. **Back to business:**; I went silent for a bit because in prototyping a typical residual computation and matrix update loop I made some realisations that made me go back to the drawing board regarding data structures, and eventually back to square 0. . ## Parallel strategy for flux computation; Because significant computation is required to obtain each edge's flux, it does not make sense to attempt a ""point-loop"" strategy (which would double the effort).; However, one can either use colouring to avoid the race conditions that would result from updating the residual of cells i and j, or store the edge fluxes and then, on a second point-loop perform the summation of fluxes for each cell, with the direction being accounted by the same adjacency information used in the point-loop GG gradient computation.; If we consider only the update of residuals the two strategies are fairly equivalent performance wise, the tie breaker is the matrix updates. ## Matrix Updates; By this I mean the `addBlock`, `subBlock` we do (two times each) to update diagonal and off-diagonal blocks for each edge.; Here is a dummy numerics loop that does nothing else but setting blocks in the matrix (with colouring).; ```c++; void testLoop1(const vector<size_t>& colorStart,; const vector<size_t>& edgeIdx,; const vector<pair<size_t,size_t> >& connectivity,; double** blk_i, double** blk_j,; SparseMatrix& matrix); {; matrix.setZero();. for(size_t color=0; color<colorStart.size()-1; ++color); #pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic,CHUNK_SIZE); for(size_t k=colorStart[color]; k<colorStart[color+1]; ++k); {; size_t iEdge = edgeIdx[k];; size_t iPoint = connectivity[iEdge].first;; size_t jPoint = connectivity[iEdge].second;. matrix.addBlock(iPoint, iPoint, blk_i);; matrix.addBlock(iPoint, jPoint, blk_j);. matrix.subBlock(jPoint, jPoint, blk_j);; matrix.subBlock(jPoint, iPoint, blk_i);; }; }",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-535977206:1160,update,update,1160,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-535977206,4,['update'],"['update', 'updates']"

Deployability," revision e6e6e6b are very small, aside from an extra test file. But revision d1e3a18 fails the regression tests and revision e6e6e6b passes the regression tests. Specifically, it's only the CHT incompressible case that's failing. The test results show:. test_vals (stored): 0.000000, 0.000000, -7.685301, -12947.783696; sim_vals (computed): 0.000000, 0.000000, -7.685301, -12947.783678 ; delta_vals: 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000000, 0.000018. It's only the total heat flux that's different, and it's only off by 1E-7%. I believe that these changes are due to floating-point errors. To check and make sure nothing is going crazy, I ran the test case under both the develop and the PR branches. When I compared the solution files, I couldn't find any points where the solution differed by more than 0.0003%. The differences seem to be very small. The two differences between revision d1e3a18 and revision e6e6e6b can be summarized as follows:. 1. In the `CNumerics::GetViscousIncProjJacs()` calculation on the develop branch, a quantity called `theta` is calculated. `theta` is the magnitude of the `val_normal` parameter, squared. The catch is that `val_normal` is passed as a unit vector (named `UnitNormal` in `CAvgGradInc_Flow::ComputeResidual`). So `theta` should always be equal to one, with some floating point errors. In the failing revision, the value is set explicitly to one. In the passing revision, the magnitude is calculated explicitly. I checked, and the difference between `theta` and 1.0 is always of the order 1E-16 or less.; 2. The second change affects where the area is multiplied into the Jacobian. When the area is multiplied at a later stage, very small differences in the calculated quantities appear. I don't like revision e6e6e6b, and I would like to revert it. The question then is how to update the tests. We could just update the regression test values, but I would propose fixing the regression test. It seems to be sensitive to what I believe are unimportant differences.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/626#issuecomment-444655022:2009,update,update,2009,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/626#issuecomment-444655022,2,['update'],['update']
Deployability," scheme for a multi-physics problem. To obtain the design accuracy in time, this implies that the loop over the number of time stages is outside the loop over the number of physical disciplines. Hence at a very high level in the hierarchy, the details of the time integration should then be known. The situation becomes even more complicated when one would like to employ time integration schemes that allow for time accurate local time stepping, e.g. the ones we are currently working on for the DG solver. I won't bore you with all the details here, but those schemes basically require the loop over the multiple disciplines to be between the predictor and corrector step, while both these steps consist of multiple stages. Although it is probably possible to come up with a data structure that supports all this, the question is whether this is desirable. Apart from the fact that it would require a major overhaul in the high level design of SU2, the implementation will be less readable, especially for people that will be starting with the code. Also the parallelization may become significantly more complicated. The alternative is that for unsteady multi-physics problems, we put the restriction that only single stage time integration schemes can be used, e.g. DT_STEPPING_1ST and DT_STEPPING_2ND. In that case, the details of the time integration scheme can be hidden at the driver level, where we then simply have a loop over the number of physical disciplines. The consequence of course is that more advanced time integration schemes will not be available for multi-physics problems. In the above I just tried to picture what, in my opinion, the consequences are for either option. I don't have a preference for one of them. The only thing I wanted to make clear is that it is not possible to hide all the details of the time integration scheme at the driver level, while also having support for all possible time integration schemes for an unsteady multi-physics problem.

For example, the inlet BC of the SA turbulence model is defined in CTurbSASolver::BC_Inlet(); We can place this definition in a separate file bcinit.cpp and dynamically link this file so you have a libbcinit.so file. SU2 knows about libbcinit.so and BC_Inlet() at compile time. ; In your testcases directory, you can put a copy of bcinit.cpp and redefine the boundary condition BC_Inlet. If you change the boundary condition, you only compile bcinit.cpp in your testcase directory and create a libbcinit.so in your testcase directory. You then make sure that when SU2 is looking for dynamically linked libraries, it searches your testcase directory before it searches the SU2 installation directory. . As you see, this can be used for redefining existing (at compile time) functions and modifying its content. I find it especially useful for creating custom initial conditions. If you want to create a completely new custom boundary condition BC_Custom(), it is probably easiest to predefine this structure and create a custom_bc option in the config file. In a CFD problem, there are only a limited number of possibilities (for types of boundary conditions, and systems of equations), so I'm not sure when a BC_Custom() is useful, or when the tipping point is where self-registering classes will become useful for its implementation. Recompiling the code completely takes maybe 2 minutes for me, so I never saw compiling times as a problem. However, this concept could reduce code duplication and improve readability and maintainability, so I'm curious to see the progress on this...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1058#issuecomment-680758665:1236,install,installation,1236,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1058#issuecomment-680758665,1,['install'],['installation']
Deployability," using the [decorator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) pattern) so that we write to the matrix only once per iteration, which means we only need to clear the diagonal blocks and not the entire matrix because we can **set** the off-diagonals instead of **updating** them. Assuming these modification our dummy loop becomes; ```c++; void testLoop2(const vector<size_t>& colorStart,; const vector<size_t>& edgeIdx,; const vector<pair<size_t,size_t> >& connectivity,; const double* blk_i, const double* blk_j,; SparseMatrix& matrix); {; matrix.setDiagZero();. for(size_t color=0; color<colorStart.size()-1; ++color); #pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic,CHUNK_SIZE); for(size_t k=colorStart[color]; k<colorStart[color+1]; ++k); {; size_t iEdge = edgeIdx[k];; size_t iPoint = connectivity[iEdge].first;; size_t jPoint = connectivity[iEdge].second;. matrix.updateBlocks(iEdge, iPoint, jPoint, blk_i, blk_j);; }; }; ```; where; ```c++; STRONGINLINE void SparseMatrix::updateBlocks(size_t edge,; size_t row, size_t col, const double* blk_i, const double* blk_j); {; size_t bii = diagMap[row], bij = edgeMap[edge].first,; bjj = diagMap[col], bji = edgeMap[edge].second;. #pragma omp simd; for(size_t k=0; k<blkSz; ++k); {; coeffs[bii+k] += blk_i[k]; coeffs[bij+k] = +blk_j[k];; coeffs[bji+k] = -blk_i[k]; coeffs[bjj+k] -= blk_j[k];; }; }; ```; This is **47% faster**, which for a memory bound task is massive!; Yes, this does increase the memory footprint a bit (makes CSysMatrix 4% larger for a 3D problem) but I can get that back by sharing sparsity patterns and maps across turbulence and bulk flow (I think @talbring was already working on this in the template linear solver branch he had started). We could also parallelize the matrix updates without colouring by setting only the off-diagonal coefficients and then setting the diagonal entries to the column sum.; It turns out that this is worse (by about 10%), maybe if the matrix were symmetric (row sum) but a column sum accesse",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-535977206:3830,update,updateBlocks,3830,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-535977206,4,['update'],['updateBlocks']
Deployability," viscousTerms(...) const {...}; };; ```; Here note that this class template is derived from CNumericsSIMD but it does not implement `ComputeFlux`, thus it cannot be instantiated by itself. The idea is that convective schemes can use these viscous fluxes as base class (thereby linking them to CNumericsSIMD) to access the `viscousTerms` method (when we don't want viscous terms we just use a dummy viscous class).; Note also the template parameter `nDim`, this is because we want to create specific versions of the numerical schemes for 2D and 3D (we ""want"" this because it allows static allocation and unrolling loops perfectly). Then convective classes also need to be class templates so that we can programatically change their base class:; ```c++; template<class Base>; class MyConvectiveScheme : public Base {; public:; void ComputeFlux(...) const {; // do my own thing; Base::viscousTerms(...);; // update the linear system with the result; }; };; ```; Now to create an instance of this class template we do for example:; ```c++; auto obj = new MyConvectiveScheme< CCompressibleViscousFlux<2> >(...);; ```; which would create an object for 2D problems with viscous terms. And so we need at least 4 instantiations of these class templates, 2D/3D with or without viscous terms, and this is done in the factory method implemented in CNumericsSIMD.cpp, which is the only cpp in this entire implementation. ### Static polymorphism; Another concept used in this implementation for efficiency is static polymorphism.; For example in the non vectorized numerics we have a family of Roe schemes since a lot of code is shared, and the only difference is how the dissipation terms are computed. There this is done with virtual functions, here we want none of that.; Virtual functions allow a parent class to dynamically call methods of its children, we want to do this statically and so we need to let the parent class know who is deriving from it.; ```c++; template<class Derived>; class Parent {; public",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1022#issuecomment-699618721:1694,update,update,1694,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1022#issuecomment-699618721,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"### Code Verification. I used a case similar to the one detailed in references [1] and [2], with a circular cylinder in high Re flow. It's a circular cylinder with a von-Karman vortex street. There's a couple reasons to not expect exact replication of their results. They used higher-order numerics (5th/3rd), a longer grid in the spanwise direction, structured overset grids, and an SST variant of DES. Here's a figure from reference [2]:. ![travinresults](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13340225/42509822-bc677aea-8412-11e8-8285-6e51895258b4.png); ; And here's the results of my rough test:. ![roe_dissipation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13340225/42510382-54f3b516-8414-11e8-9be4-07aafdd2468a.png). As you can see, the central/upwind blending function is doing what it's supposed to do. It's going to 0 in regions with both high vorticity and a fine grid, but goes to 1 in the near-wall RANS regions and in the outer region of the flow. There are a few artifacts around the cylinder, where the grid is fine but the eddy viscosity is still low. I'm talking about the few spots you see around the cylinder. There is a relatively high vorticity there, and the grid is fine, so the values make sense. It's hard to tell if this is due to imperfections in the grid, imperfections in the code implementation, or imperfections in the NTS model itself. ### References. 1. A. Travin, M. Shur, M.

Deployability,"'mpi4py/mpi4py.i'; ```; But mpi4py is indeed installed on your system and it's on your python path, as confirmed by opening a python terminal and running `import mpi4py`. #### The easiest workaround. Switch to a [virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). This will ensure that all of your python packages are stored in single location. #### Alternate workaround. In this method, you change the hardcoded includes to match mpi4py's package location. First I figure out where my mpi4py is installed. I start a terminal session of python using the python environment I want to use (in this case, it's python 3.6), and then run:; ```; from mpi4py import MPI; MPI; ```. Since I have mpi4py installed on your system and it's on my python path, I see something like:; ```; <module 'mpi4py.MPI' from '/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mpi4py/MPI.cpython-34m.so'>; ```. The `/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python3.6/` directory is where my mpi4py package is installed. But the swig compile command includes `/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python2.7/`. That's not the right directory! So first I find the hardcoded paths of the makefile by running (on a bash terminal):; ```; grep -rn python2\.7 SU2_PY/ ; ```; On my system, this prints out four lines. I don't care about the `Makefile.in` files, because those are generated automatically and will be overwritten every time I run ""configure"" or ""preconfigure.py."" The `NUMPY_INCLUDE` line is also commented out, so I ignore that too. That leaves me with one line, line 51 of `SU2_PY/pySU2/Makefile.am`:. ```; SU2_PY/pySU2/Makefile.am:51:MPI4PY_INCLUDE = ${HOME}/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mpi4py/include \; ```. I now modify line 51 of Makefile.am to read:. ```; MPI4PY_INCLUDE = ${HOME}/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mpi4py/include \; ```. Then run configure or preconfigure.py again, and then run make again. You should be good to go!. #### tl;dr.

Deployability,"(I seem to have a knack to find cans of worms).; What I did in a55ca26 is not accurate, the integral of the fluid stress needs to be done in current coordinates and the normal available trough CVertex is in reference (undeformed) coordinates. I've implemented this in the structural solver as a preprocessing step. For each surface element of all FSI markers an average stress is computed based on its nodal values, it is then integrated in current (deformed) coordinates. A second pass over the elements scatters the force on the element to the nodes, this is to account for nodes that participate in multiple markers.; The mechanism by which the structural solver takes the flow tractions and updates the Residual vector was not changed, so this changes are fairly local.; The only downside I see is that knowledge of whether the interpolation is consistent or conservative is now required in two locations... Verification of the FSI adjoint is still ongoing.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/597#issuecomment-429427811:427,integrat,integrated,427,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/597#issuecomment-429427811,2,"['integrat', 'update']","['integrated', 'updates']"
Deployability,"(I was not expecting this many comments so quickly, thanks guys!). First let me clarify the intent.; I do not propose replacing the routines that deal with CSysMatrix, or change its format, all that (Krylov solvers, sparse approximate factorizations, etc.) is relatively independent from what I have in mind.; Nevertheless being able to use PETSc or HYPRE would be interesting as it would give us access to AMG, and @talbring 's branch feature_template_linear_solver would make such an integration compatible with AD.; What I would like is to have a ""CMatrixDense"" class, to give concrete examples:; - For RBF interpolation the guy who worked on it before me implemented his own Cholesky and LU factorizations, matrix-matrix, matrix-vector routines, etc.; - @jayantmukho recently needed some eigenvector decomposition's for the uncertainty quantification feature.; - I imagine in some other places of the code similar routines were needed, for example small matrix inversion when computing gradients by weighted least squares (indeed what I need now is a QR decomposition). And, as an added bonus, I think some other areas of the code could be simplified / optimized by adopting a dense matrix format, for example:; - This snipped from the viscous numerics refactoring`for (iDim = 0; iDim < nDim; iDim++) {; TauElem[iDim] = 0.0;; for (jDim = 0; jDim < nDim; jDim++); TauElem[iDim] += tau[iDim][jDim]*UnitNormal[jDim];; }` would simply become `TauElem=tau*UnitNormal`; - Cumbersome allocations like `tau_jacobian_i = new su2double* [nDim];; for (iDim = 0; iDim < nDim; iDim++) {; tau_jacobian_i[iDim] = new su2double [nVar];; }` become `Matrix tau_jacobian_i(nDim,nVar);` and the cleanup is dealt with by the destructor of the object automatically. Now to answer some questions.; @juanjosealonso @erangit LAPACK and BLAS are indeed the standard, so much so that most (all?) newer libraries will call their routines behind the scenes.; However they considerably simplify the user interface by encapsulat",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/643#issuecomment-459653772:486,integrat,integration,486,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/643#issuecomment-459653772,2,['integrat'],['integration']

Deployability,*Update: the conflicts were due to mutually editing methods for the discrete adjoint; I had added some objectives prior to the recent discrete adjoint pull request. ; @talbring if you have a minute to take a look at how I've handled these objectives in iteration_structure.cpp that would be much appreciated.; I think I have resolved the conflicts; the source of most of the problems was with registering outflow-based objective functions which depend on values that were only calculated at an output step.

The command used was:. ```; python3 $SU2_RUN/mesh_adaptation_amg.py -f adapt_Mesh.cfg -n 4; ```; The script initiates the mesh adaptation process as expected, with the following output:. ```; SU2-AMG Anisotropic Mesh Adaptation.

The critical part of this error seems to be the Error in TokenizeString() message, suggesting an issue with parsing the configuration file. This error typically indicates a syntax problem, such as having multiple options on a single line without proper separation by an equal sign (=). However, upon reviewing _adap/ini/config_CFD.cfg_, was unable to find any lines that clearly violated this syntax rule. Could this error be indicative of a more subtle issue within the configuration file, or might it be related to specific aspects of the feature_adap branch? Any insights, suggestions, or guidance on how to troubleshoot this error would be greatly appreciated. If anyone has a working adapt_mesh.cfg file for a similar setup or for the feature_adap branch, I would be very interested in seeing it. Understanding the configuration details of a working example could be highly beneficial in resolving my issue.

Deployability,"> * From the history output it seems that the maximum CFL value is not being reached, even for small CFL values the update seems to stop one step before max. There was a small factor applied to keep it above and below the CFL min and max (1.001, 0.999), respectively. But I have removed that, since it is not necessary. Btw, I have added the ability to print the min/max time step, and min/max/avg CFL to the screen by adding MIN_DELTA_TIME, MAX_DELTA_TIME, MIN_CFL, MAX_CFL, AVG_CFL to the SCREEN_OUTPUT. > * I still see some residual oscillations with high CFL values (100-1000), I think the issue is that despite the oscillations the linear solver still converges fine, and so the reduction never kicks in. There are reduction checks for both the linear and nonlinear residuals, but they likely still need some tuning (the factors were just empirical from my tests). I am also finding in my tests that if I am having trouble with a particular RANS case, sometimes it is most effective to turn off the adaption and go for a fixed CFL of 250, 500, or even 1000, if stable (don't forget you may need NUM_METHOD_GRAD_RECON= LEAST_SQUARES for that to be stable).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790#issuecomment-541376224:116,update,update,116,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/790#issuecomment-541376224,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"> ; > ; > Dear Daumantas,; > ; > I appreciate your effort in adding support for cmake in SU2. We have recently introduced the Meson build system (https://mesonbuild.com/) (#685, #745) as a candidate to replace automake. A guide on how to use can be found [here](https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Build-SU2-From-Source/). The idea is that we will have this system along automake at least for the upcoming version 7 and that we get rid of automake afterwards. Considering that, I don't think that it makes sense to maintain 3 different build systems **at the moment**. I really hate turning contributions down, but this one is three months too late. However, we might reconsider adding support for another build system once we got rid of automake, or, if we feel that meson does not fit our needs.; > ; > I am all ears to hear other opinions. However, let's not start a discussion on the advantages/disadvantages of the build systems. Some benefits can be found in the Issue/PR linked above. Ok, I tried meson with MinGW but couldn't figure out how to link with MSMPI since it's not a part of MinGW. However, using CMake and with a few source code fixes, I managed to compile nearly every configuration with MSVC. Surprisingly, there were very few errors in SU2. The externals only had a few preprocessor issues. At the moment only MeDiPack fails to compile with MSVC but not with MinGW even though the MPI headers are the same so I suspect it's an issue with MSVC itself, I'm using the latest preview version.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814#issuecomment-553571450:1187,configurat,configuration,1187,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/814#issuecomment-553571450,2,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"> @kursatyurt Hello, thank you so much for the lead.; > ; > Our initial scope mostly involved writing our own kernels and I did explore some libraries at the start - I was planning on using CUSP as well but my main concern was its lack of being updated to the newly compatible versions of the toolkit. cuSolver and cuBLAS do exist, but I chose to go ahead with a ""simple"" kernel implementation to have more control. I also felt that if I could keep the block size of the grid in optimal territory then they could be just as fast as those options (please do correct me if my reading of the literature or the situation was incorrect). To learn the basics, it's a good idea, but for large-scale projects, I prefer using existing libraries if possible.; Those libraries generally exploit state-of-the-art solution like mixed-precision computing. A gaming GPU is not way faster than a good CPU in double precision, but way faster in single precision, most of them have 64:1 ratio, however server class GPU have 2:1 ratio. Also when available they use vendor libraries like cuBLAS or hipBLAS. It is always nice to have you only care about connection and somebody else handle the solver as performant as possible. In future probably they will provide more and more solvers and it will be automagically works.

So if the the option `ITER_DCL_DALPHA = 0` then it will do exactly what you suggest. It calculates the derivative based on the last update. The only problem with that is, there is no guarantee that the simulation at the previous update was converged, so the derivative might be incorrect. .

Deployability,"> Only thing not addressed yet is the symmetry BC for the turbulence models (we prob need to add something similar). TobiKattmann : do you have time to look at that as part of this PR? Or shall we do that separately?. The implementation for the turbulence models is correct as is. No flux is considered for the convective and viscous fluxes by inserting the symmetry conditions directly in the FV derivation. Convective fluxes vanish as velocity*normal=0, viscous fluxes vanish by grad(transported scalar)*n=0 on the symmetry faces of the boundary. Above I denoted that as ""direct flux"" approach. ; (I will attach an updated pdf here later). Although the ""reflected state"" approach is a more proactive approach and might be beneficial for convergence. Could be worth a shot if somebody really has an issue here, for now I leave it as is. **NEXT STEP** I will update the Regression test values at the failing cases.

Deployability,"> SU2 is a fantastic library, but the build process is really painful to get static linking within another C++ program. CMake is a standard for building C++ projects and would be extremely helpful. Ideally Python wouldn't be necessary to build SU2 or link it with another project. I'm not sure I understand this... the fact that the build system uses python means that it is really painful to configure the build system to emit a static library? (This should absolutely not be the case! Meson has a core option `-Ddefault_library={static|shared|both}` to select what kind of library you want to build, for any library whose build description claims it can support either one. It's a bit like cmake's `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS` except much more powerful.). However, as far as I can tell, su2 doesn't mark any of its libraries as public at all (i.e., installable) so maybe that's a moot point. As far as making python be necessary to build the project, I think this mainly boils down to ""I myself use cmake, I have cmake installed, I don't want to install another program when I could use the program I already have"".

Deployability,"> Thank you for updating the solution file @snow54 , there's quite a big difference in the adjoint residuals, do the final derivatives still make sense?

Deployability,"> There are 2 cases in the testcases repository, both are using the Euler solver. Maybe also check if your case is running correctly with the settings from those testcases. Earlier, I was defining the mesh movement for the static zone as:. ` GRID_MOVEMENT= NONE `. since it was stationary. However, after checking the test cases, I found that the stator zones should also be defined as moving as. ```; GRID_MOVEMENT= RIGID_MOTION; MOTION_ORIGIN= 0.0 0.0 0.0; ROTATION_RATE = 0.0 0.0 0.0 ; ```. even though the mesh stays stationary. In that case, the unphysical flow results I presented earlier vanished. Earlier, I tried the cylinder test case with the inner zone having . ```; GRID_MOVEMENT= RIGID_MOTION; MOTION_ORIGIN= 0.0 0.0 0.0; ROTATION_RATE = 0.0 0.0 0.0; ```. and the outer zone having; ` GRID_MOVEMENT= NONE `. where the simulation gave physically viable results. I guess the zone interface may not accurately work if the `GRID_MOVEMENT` options of the neighbouring zones do not match while one of the zones has a non-zero movement. However, I have not simulated any other test cases. Also, the sliding_interface/rotating_cylinders test case diverges with the given .cfg files. At around the 775th time step, I received the following error message:. `SU2 has diverged (Residual > 10^20 detected). `.

One could even keep `SST` while adding a warning that `SST` will be deprecated in the future and that `SST-1994` is the equivalent successor. The upside of doing it like that is that it wouldn't interfere that much with peoples cases (only little cfg change necessary to produce the same results) and it would be much less work for you to change all the regression tests. And although the 2003-version is supposed to be an update to the 1994 version, I would bet there are people who prefer the 1994 version by choice.

But, note that this tolerance only controls when to print the warnings, so the matches should have still be the same (nearest neighbor after transformation). . The reason is that the new implementation assumes a 1-to-1 matching of the nodes and surface elements on either side of the periodic face. To be consistent, the points/faces on either side should match exactly so that they can be summed into a complete dual control volume (this assumption is made in the implementation and the partial residuals are summed as such).

Deployability,"@bigfooted Has there ever been any discussion regarding implementation of a `START_TIME=` capability into the config file? After going through the code a bit, it looks like doing this would be a good starting point for implementing ability to adjust deltaT mid-runs, as in general the code presumes `TimeIter*deltaT` as being the current time. This would be problematic for unsteady restarts that have a varying timestep. Plus, this would allow one to, without using the Python wrapper, use a different timestep in the config file for an unsteady restart. It also may clear up some confusion to have an explicit option for this, as in #2071.

In the *.cfg file I also make sure to add CSV tabular output management, as well as ASCII outputs.; `TABULAR_FORMAT= CSV`; `OUTPUT_FILES= RESTART_ASCII`. The python script to run the case with mesh adaptation is :; `$ python3 SU2_RUN/mesh_adaptation_amg.py -f adap_ONERAM6.cfg -n 8`; The python script handles all the folder structure, initialization, mesh adaptation(s), sub iteration(s).; 1. At first it removes the contents of an `adap` folder.; 2. creates `adap\ini` and starts the initialization run (with the original mesh).; 3. creates `adap\ite0` and based on the solution of the initialization run adapts the mesh with the given goal.

Deployability,"@clarkpede @EduardoMolina : yep, the issue is that the periodic and MPI communications are tangled up together in the current implementation. The main issue occurs when there are periodic points that are also ghost nodes. . Ideally the periodic and MPI would be separated, and the periodic communications would happen first so that all periodic BCs are synchronized before trying to send across partitions. Right now, the comms are mixed, so sometimes, we send old data at periodic points to their matching pair, which then gets updated in a later MPI comm. Therefore, the second call you have added to the MPI resends the periodic update to with the correct data that was updated with MPI in the first call. I hope this is clear.. Anyway, please go with this change as you have it. All of the MPI and periodic comms will be replaced with a cleaner/separated version right after v6.2.0 (you can see what I am working on in feature_mpi_periodic).

Numerous bugs in the creation of the initial periodic BCs and new mesh file generated by SU2_MSH (ordering, inability to treat adjacent periodic markers, e.g., triply-periodic cube, and others). The branches above contain some fixes, and we should also merge in your #500 too. 2. Runtime issues in SU2_CFD, especially in parallel. Some of these issues may be fixed by the branches above, but the second step is to create the periodic BCs on the fly in SU2_CFD and integrate properly with the parallel partitioning, removing the need to call SU2_MSH as a pre-processing.

Deployability,"@economon I was envisioning something similar to the TestCases folder. With v&v cases grouped according to what they are testing. Something along the lines of: . 1) Inviscid Simulations: ; a) 2D Inviscid bump; b) 2D oblique shocks interaction; c) ...; 2) RANS simulations: ; a) Flatplate; b) NACA0012; c) ...; 3) Unsteady simulations:; a) Square Cylinder; b) ...; 4) Turbomachinary: ; a) ... And so on. Each of the directories would have sub-directories for different mesh sizes, with configuration files for each mesh level that have optimized parameters for best results. So for example if we are talking about the NACA0012 case, we would have something along the lines of: . a) NACA0012; i) 113 x 33; ii) 225 x 65 ; iii) 449 x 129; iv) ... This way we have a family of meshes and configuration files that are specifically built for the purpose of validating the code and comparing with other solvers. I might be useful to compress meshes that are larger than a certain size (say 10MB). We should also put a limit on the size of a single mesh that the repository can handle (say 50MB?). . Within the home directory, the README file should list all the cases in the repository, who the custodian of the test case is (person with meshes in case the meshes are too large), and which version it was last run on. . I thought about splitting it up into Verification cases and Validation cases, but I thought it would be more informative and intuitive to split up according to the physics of the simulations. My thinking might be limited because that's how I have seen the TestCases folder organized, so any other suggestions are welcome. I think it is imperative that this is accompanied with a section on the SU2 website that showcases just the results of the validation test cases (grid convergence studies, residual reductions etc) and links to the v&v repo appropriately.

Deployability,"@jayantmukho Thanks for taking the lead on that. This is long overdue ... I already talked to some people about that and the conclusion was often that we should get rid of the current python framework and rely solely on the in-memory python wrapper functionalities. From what I can tell this is also what you would suggest. I have some additional things to add here:. - We should keep in mind other things than ""just"" shape optimization problems.; - The surface parameterization should be more or less independent of all the other things, so that we can easily integrate other tools/methods. In a first step it might be a good idea to just put all the FFD stuff into a separate (c++) library with a python interface.; - As you already mentioned, I am currently working on a more general way of defining output fields and in particular also objective functions in #913. I will add more information to this PR soon. The new python implementation should, in theory, not need to know about the specific objective function, but rather just asks for the value and the (surface) gradient. ; - We have to expose more c++ classes/functions to python. Especially the config and the geometry. . Maybe I will add more stuff/ideas, but thats it for now. @clarkpede : We will probably keep most of the postprocessing stuff in c++, so don't worry about that at the moment.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/923#issuecomment-607708376:561,integrat,integrate,561,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/923#issuecomment-607708376,1,['integrat'],['integrate']
Deployability,"@jayantmukho The fix in PR in #921 is done. Whereas the shape optimization restart did not work before, it does work now, at least on the two test cases I checked. The only thing missing is a regression test, to make sure bugs like that don't happen again. So I agree that it should be merged soon while the long-term refactoring occurs. As for post-processing, the objective function calculation can be quite complex in the use-cases Beckett and I have encountered. That's why it's run as a post-processing step, rather than updated continuously during runtime. But I agree that those types of changes can be limited to the C++ side of the code, with minimal changes to the python wrappers. So it may not be relevant to the current refactoring.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/923#issuecomment-607975492:526,update,updated,526,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/923#issuecomment-607975492,2,"['continuous', 'update']","['continuously', 'updated']"

Deployability,"@mheimgartner it would be helpful to compare the full residual history of the two regression Testcases before and after this last commit. (you prob already have the ""old"" histories and just have to do 2 new ones, you know best how the case beahaves etc). The commit I added will fail the regression test but I strongly believe the Pseudo-time update, convective and viscous Jacobians were wrong. . A reason this went unnoticed might be because the densities were O(1), so disregarding them in the solution update after the Linear Solver acts some kind of Relaxation Factor (which can be larger 1 depending whether density < or > 1). And I guess that could be fixed via CFL or this CFLReductionFactor anyway.; The Jacobians were taking with respect to Y alone, which is not correct. They have to be taken with respect with rho*Y, the transported variable imo. The conv Jacobian is arguably the most important one (and tested alone showed the biggest lift in residual improvement). ; I briefly checked the BC's and DualTimeRes for this Jacobian problem. For the BC's I found no hand-derived Jacobians and DualTimeRes seems ok (but is not used afaik).; Note that if one got a case to convergence(=> Res ~=0) the Jacobians and pseudo time derivative do not matter of course at that point.

Deployability,"@talbring Thanks for the quick and helpful answer! I'm looking at creating an ebuild/package for gentoo, compilation is a lot simpler than OpenFoam :P which is a big plus :). Anyway, I was looking at the old docs (the main docs still point to 6.0, I missed the red text that mentioned that somehow :P), not sure why, but you're right it's indeed mentioned in the 7.0 docs here https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Build-SU2-Linux-MacOS/#configuration-and-compilation. The ""Automatically installed dependencies"" section left me a bit confused because it sounded like the things listed there, which includes meson and ninja, would always get installed.; Maybe merging that section into the configuration and compilation section might help to make it more clear?. If you don't mind I have some additional questions:; - I didn't initialize the git submodule at all and configuration, compilation and running worked fine. Does this mean the CoDiPack and MeDiPack dependencies are optional? Or does this mean I could have a crash at runtime somewhere?; - Would it be possible to add a source package to the GitHub releases (in addition to the binary ones) that includes the (CoDiPack and MeDiPack) submodules?

Deployability,"@talbring Thanks. That second link is very informative. I think that SU2 could really use a more advanced build process, and meson seems like a good candidate. As an example of why I think SU2 needs a better build process: Right now for AD builds, the build process listed in the tutorial asks you to use the `preconfigure.py` script to download and update the codi and medi git submodules. But there's a couple problems with the preconfigure script. It doesn't support out-of-source builds, and it expects all configure arguments to come in ""option=value"" pairs. A good build process (using CMake or meson) should allow adding submodules or external packages easily, without problems like these.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/685#issuecomment-500395507:350,update,update,350,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/685#issuecomment-500395507,1,['update'],['update']
Deployability,"@talbring That was a good point about placement. I was able to move this implementation to a function called `FixedCL_Convergence()` in the euler solver class. It also allowed me to make it a little more robust. Since it still requires information about the convergence that is calculated in the integration container, the method has to be called `CFluidIteration::Iterate()`. I included the details of the implementation in the Constant CL tutorial on the website. That is in a pull request for the website.

Deployability,"@talbring: thanks for adding the regressions. One iteration is perfect just to check they're running, if they have the originals still being tested in the TestCases. I think the idea of having the written tutorials/documentation for the test cases in the main repository is a very good one, for several reasons. In particular, it will make it easier for people to add documentation, and we could eventually even test for its existence in Travis or make it a strict requirement for PRs in the future. My only concern at the moment is making sure that they look ""nice"" when viewed and that the links are easy to update/follow. We should probably add a title at the top of each tutorial markdown file now (above the first image), since the titles from the wiki page are missing. The image files should be moved from the website repo (su2code.github.io/github_wiki/) to these Tutorials folders. Another idea is to put a top-level ""Tutorials"" markdown file that will be linked from the wiki at the root Tutorials/ directory so that one only has to update the links to new tutorials in that file in the main repo, rather than always updating both the main repo and manually updating the wiki too.

Deployability,"@timjim333 it could be an issue with shared libraries, which ultimately is a path issue, as you suspected.; To verify it try opening a python shell, checking the version displayed (should be your 3.7.8) and try `import pyamg` in the shell. If the ""No such file or directory"" error shows up, it means pyamg was not correctly installed; otherwise it is in fact installed. In the latter case, you can check if your python is configured to enable shared libraries. To do it, according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23201498/how-to-check-if-python3-was-built-with-enable-shared), in the python shell you can type ; `import sysconfig`; `sysconfig.get_config_vars('Py_ENABLE_SHARED')`; If the result is `[0]`, ie ""False"", you have to build python with the option `--enable-shared`. ; Now, I don't know how to do accomplish that with conda, but with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) it involves installing the desired python version with `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install <version>`. To recap, a ""workflow for newbies"" which appears to be working for me is. 1. install pyenv either from [source](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) or from your distibution repositories, if available. IMPORTANT: make sure the environment variables are correctly set and `pyenv init` is added to your shell, as per the installation instructions.; 2. install the desired python version (for example 3.7.8), enabling shared libraries: ; `CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared pyenv install 3.7.8`; 3. clone/download the [feature_adap](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/tree/feature_adap) branch of SU2;; 4. in the SU2 folder, configure meson ; `./meson.py build` ; and make sure to update the environment variables in your `.bashrc` as indicated by meson's output.; 5. use ninja to build and install SU2 ; `./ninja -C build install`;; if you run into a permission error, specify an installation directory passing the `--prefix` option to meson, as explained [here](https://www.cfd-online.com/Fo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/948#issuecomment-751823130:324,install,installed,324,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/948#issuecomment-751823130,4,['install'],"['install', 'installed', 'installing']"

With GCC 9, ignoring warnings from Boost and OpenMPI (on Fedora 30), I see three types of warnings: (1) clause does not guard… (misleading indentation), (2) Implicitly-declared operator= is deprecated, and (3) writing to an object of type…use copy-assignment or copy-initialization instead. (1) Is a side-effect of code obfuscation (the reason management lets us release this code), and is probably unavoidable.; (2) and (3) are probably addressable. I’ll put these on my to-do list.

I already replaced almost all error messages in the code. - More MPI functions are included in the MPI Wrapper. - The rank/size is now stored in most of the bigger classes and initialized in the constructor. That means there are no calls to MPI_Comm_rank / MPI_Comm_size anymore in every routine ...

Deployability,After some testing I can report the following:. - With Jacobian contributions disabled convergence is greatly increased and on-par with the isothermal/heat flux configurations; - After around 12800 timesteps the solution diverges and SU2 crashes.; - For some reason the global flowfield is drastically different between convective and isothermal/adiabatic cases. As the convective case is somewhere between adiabatic and isothermal conditions this should not be the case. Here you can see a comparison of pressure between convective case (top) and isothermal case (bottom).

Deployability,"All,. For whatever it is worth, here are some thoughts. It is clear that we need to strike the right level and hierarchy of abstraction: at the highest level one really ought to be describing the physical problem, not the number of zones or the specific time-stepping algorithm that would be used. But preventing future multi-zone calculations from reaching the (time) order of accuracy desired is also an important issue that SU2 must support (and that I think would be very important for those doing unsteady turbomachinery calculations). Just as important: even for multi-physics problems (say fluid-structure interaction, when the fluid and structural solvers are not closely integrated into the same source) we need to ensure that the time accuracy of the full multi-physics calculation is as high as those of the component physics solvers. This is a very valid and useful discussion and some proposals are on the table. Given that we are planning a developer’s meeting sometime before the end of the year, this may actually be one of the items in the agenda for discussion, so some decisions can be reached that both make sense and minimize the pain of changes for any part of the existing code. I would suggest that the conversation continue and that other proposals are put forward so the discussion can be finalized at the developer’s meeting. Best,. Juan.

I agree with you that the outer loop should be the loop over the number of physical disciplines involved in the problem and not the zones. Whether the individual disciplines contain one or multiple zones is irrelevant at this level, in my opinion. The loop over the multiple zones of a single discipline should take place at a much lower level, namely where the spatial residual is computed.

Deployability,"All,. Thanks for getting this going. My two cents:. 1. Indeed, while these V&V cases and the TestCases directory / repo are not identical, there is some overlap…some of the TestCases are definitely validation cases too. We can continue to add test cases to the TestCases repo, knowing that only a subset of those cases belong in the V&V list. 2. An important aspect of the V&V is the convergence of the solution as the mesh is refined. As Jayant knows well, this can help us catch bugs. This means that a well-constructed V&V suite needs to include a series of meshes (of increasing density), the corresponding configuration files, and the actual experimental data (or other numerical data from runs on different solvers). I strongly agree with the suggestions made that (a) the entire V&V suite needs to be run before every major release (with configuration files updated), (b) that this should be linked form the main SU2 page, (c) that the 2014 AIAA paper (and Tom’s AVIATION 2018 paper) should serve as a starting point, (d) that the NASA TMR website can give us ideas of additional access, and (e) that the SU2 V&V page should be managed within GitHub.com<http://GitHub.com> so the entire community can edit / add to this / these page/s to continue to grow the number of cases and their relevance.

Deployability,"Attaching some results for the RAE2822 of the pressure field zoomed in right near the shock on the upper surface. The results do change (lift and drag by a couple percent) mostly due to a change in shock position it seems. The pressure field also shows the same behavior referenced above when the term is included. Unfortunately, we do not have much data to compare with here, since this case is not on the TMR. The integrated quantities above for the bump problem do not appear to be too sensitive to it either way, but the pressure field does indeed show the same discrepancies. In general, I have not been able to find any strong arguments for or against including the term in literature/codes. Although it is prescribed by the theory, some folks mention it is sometimes dropped (TMR also says it is sometimes ignored unless supersonic), or it gets dropped without mention at all. It is certainly affecting the pressure distribution, so we should take that into consideration. It is possible that there is some other bug that gets exposed by its inclusion, but I did not come across anything yet. As we know the SA model does not exhibit this behavior, I lean toward removing it.

Deployability,"Dear @rsanfer,. I agree with you that the outer loop should be the loop over the number of physical disciplines involved in the problem and not the zones. Whether the individual disciplines contain one or multiple zones is irrelevant at this level, in my opinion. The loop over the multiple zones of a single discipline should take place at a much lower level, namely where the spatial residual is computed. At least, this should be the case for the fluid dynamics part. I don't know whether this is also the case for other disciplines, like structures. What about the following high level structure?. - Loop over the number of iterations, or time steps for unsteady problems.; - Loop over the number of pseudo-time steps for implicit time integration schemes; (DT_STEPPING_1ST and DT_STEPPING_2ND). For other cases this loop is 1.; - Loop over the number of disciplines involved; Call iterate for each of the disciplines.; In iterate: ; - Loop over the (Runge-Kutta) stages; - Loop over the zones of a single discipline; Compute spatial residual.; Update the state vector.; - End loop over the zones of a single discipline.; Exchange halo data. This includes the halo data between zones of a single discipline.; - End loop over the (Runge-Kutta) stages ; - End loop over the disciplines; - End loop over the pseudo time steps.; - End loop over the number of iterations, or time steps for unsteady problems. The weakness of this approach is that it still does not work when one would like to employ multi-stage time integration schemes for an unsteady, multi-disciplinary problem (does not work for the current implementation either), but maybe this is something we simply have to accept. The alternative is that all the details of the different time integration schemes have to be moved to the driver classes, which is highly undesirable, I think.

Thanks to the high level of abstraction of the CInterpolator, CTransfer and the CIteration classes, it was kind of natural to treat fluid-fluid problems similarly to multi-physics problem (i.e. fluid-structure and fluid-heat). As a matter of fact, the multi-stage turbomachinery approach , its adjoint counterpart, the sliding interface they all rely on this driver structure in which we loop among all the zones. If i understood correctly, you suggest to move only the fluid-fluid multi-zone loop at lower level in order to integrate in time only after having coupled all the fluid zones. Right? If so, we need to design the code in such a way that the fluid zones loop is separated from the multi-physics one.; To solve this issue, I think, we just need to find a smart way to differentiate fluid-zones from the rest. Perhaps we can do that by instantiating one Iteration per physical problem instead than per zone. So that inside the iteration we can couple all the fluid zones, and in the driver we can couple the different physics (Iteration). Indeed, this is just a preliminary idea. In general I think we should aim to a structure that can flexibly accommodate multi-physics problems with multi-zones for different physics. A good example is solving fluid-structure in multi-stage turbomachinery, in which we have multiple fluid-zones and multiple structure-zones. ; ; I would like to hear on this matter also from @fpalacios @talbring , @economon , @rsanfer @oleburghardt ,@LaSerpe and @arubino. Thanks @vdweide againg for raising this issue. cheers.

Deployability,"Dear all,; Thank you very much for your comments!; I agree with you, transferring the velocity is definitely the best solution in the long run. However, as Pedro mentioned, there is also the case when a certain imposed deformation is set, without solving any structural system. This is the case of a forced motion. In the python script configuration files it is required to set the marker_fluid_load as this is the only way to make SU2 compute the tractions at that marker. Maybe, a solution to both needs, can be to make SU2 compute the tractions anyway for the wall boundary. . In this way, if you have the velocity at the interface, you can define this interface as also marker_fluid_load, the FSI bool will be true and the new BC_velocity will be used. If you do not have the velocity at the interface, you will avoid marker_fluid_load and SU2 will not fail trying to use bc_velocity. This will also give me more time to develop, from the python side, the required modifications to use the new interface.

Deployability,"Doh, of course. Took a while to get some orientation in the code, but before implementing something I'd just like to clarify a few things:. As far as I can see the window size changes each time a new sample is added and the new average is immediatly recomputed and cached in `val`.; https://github.com/su2code/SU2/blob/72b2fa977b64b9683a388920f05298a40d39e5c5/SU2_CFD/src/output/COutput.cpp#L1916-L1928; I didn't find any other references to `WindowedUpdate` or `addValue`. Consequently it doesn't really make sense to cache the sum over n-1 samples, right?. Assuming that the windowing-function cannot change at runtime I'd propose the following changes:. - Add a new constructor to CWindowedAverage which takes the windowID as input parameter and stores it in a const field.; - Initialize the map that stores the CWindowedAverages in the COutput constructor with CWindowedAverage objects constructed with the WindowId specifed.; - Merge the code that updates the average (`WindowedUpdate`) into `addValue`, since both are currently called successively anyway. Delete `WindowedUpdate` function.; - Modify `addValue` to only store history for non-trivial windows. Another option might be to make CWindowedAverage (or `CWindowingTools`) an abstract class with `GetWndWeight` as pure virtual function that needs to be implemented for concrete windows. This would get rid of the duplicate code and switch-statements in CWindowedAverage. The constructor of COutput would then have to initialize the map with the right concrete class.

There are also some results from other studies in the literature in the attached document. ; It seems to me that, the NREL case may not be the best case for validating our model. Comparing the results in the literature, none of the surface streamlines agree well with eachother. In the absence of experimental data, it is difficult to tell which one is more reasonable. I would be happy if you would also comment on these results.; Also, I wonder what the next step is. Is there anything else that you require us to do before merging the model into the master code? I think if the transition model was released officially, the community may apply the transition model to different test cases that we may not heard of or the proprietary ones. .

Deployability,"Eduardo,. Thanks for the papers. I think we need to spend a little time verifying that everything is still ok in the old preconditioning implementation. You're correct that we are computing the dual time source, i.e., the time derivative term discretized using BDF2 for instance, within CEulerSolver::SetResidual_DualTime(). However, it looks to me that in Eqn. 18 of Weiss and Smith, these terms are not affected by the preconditioning (the right-hand side of Eqn. 18 is what we have implemented currently, and I think it is ok). But, you're right about needing to precondition the pseudo-time term, which eventually goes to zero. One major difference for us from that paper is the scheme we use to relax the pseudo-time problem. They are using an explicit multi-stage scheme, while we are solving with a fully implicit scheme. While they will compute the update of ∆Q in Eqn. 18 by inverting that small matrix locally at each node, we will smooth our global linear system that resulted from our implicit discretization to get solution updates at all nodes. Therefore, when they add the Gamma term on the left-hand side locally, I think we should be adding that to the diagonal of our larger system matrix. In fact, we are doing something like this already, but I think we should double-check that everything is ok. Can you please look at CEulerSolver::ImplicitEuler_Iteration() to make sure the implementation for the preconditioning there is correct?.

Deployability,"Edwin,. I think it is a good idea to be able to have some level of control over the application of the wall functions on a marker-by-marker basis: as you say, it would be fairly common to have a wing marker where integration to the wall makes sense and a fuselage marker where wall functions (or even an inviscid BC) is the right thing to do. So let’s indeed do something like what Tom suggests (in the spirit of MARKER_MONITORING) so that one can control which markers get wall functions applied. If a list of markers is not specified in the config file, the default behavior should be that all no-slip walls get wall function BCs. If a list of markers is specified, then those and only those markers listed get wall function Bfs (with the others getting integration to the wall treatment).

Deployability,"First of all, thanks @bmunguia for picking this up.. I ran out of time when we were wrapping up v7, so the approach to check for stalling residuals within the CFL adaption routine was half-baked at best. It can definitely be improved (I'm not happy that I left some magic numbers hard-coded in there!). The implementation that is there to check for stall was very loosely based on the type of check we use for computing the Cauchy criteria (accumulated residual changes over time), but we should consider different approaches altogether. Btw, the original CFL adaption routine used something close to Switched Evolution Relaxation, while the new strategy is Exponential Progression with Under-relaxation (see ""A Robust Adaptive Solution Strategy for High-Order Implicit CFD Solvers,"" AIAA 2011-3696 for a short description of both). As you also guessed, I had wanted to experiment with separate CFL numbers for flow and turbulence but also did not get to it. In the end, as @pcarruscag says, this is a very empirical task.

Deployability,"Harichand, Giulio, Edwin, and all,. I would definitely prefer to use either (a) an open source library that is actively maintained, or (b) our own tree-based search. I do think that this is important for the various reasons that have been outlined/discussed already. The method Harichand describes is pretty much what we did in the ASC program. Edwin can provide more details (and we had an AIAA paper around 2005 on this topic). My suggestion: if Edwin has a tree search in C++ already and someone is willing to spend the time to integrated it, that would be the best option. We get the performance that is needed with a lightweight tree search, without external dependencies (to libraries that may provide a lot of other functionality we do not need), and we can expand to parallel trees as needed. If there is no code already available, then PCL seems like a good alternative (since it seems one can compile only portions of the library). Any takers?. Cheers,. Juan. On Jun 8, 2016, at 4:35 AM, Harichand M V <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>> wrote:. All,. Thanks for your comments. I think ANNlibrary is no longer maintained. It would be better if we can use a well maintained library in-order to prevent issues in future. Additionally ANNlibrary does not support distributed trees. As far as I know, pointcloud library also does not support distributed trees. I guess we will have to write a wrapper routine using MPI. This will create a local tree for its own portion of the surface mesh. Now distance computation can be done by querying all the trees and using the minimum. One catch here is that we will have to compute distance queries in a group in order to prevent the communication latency eating up the advantage.

Likewise, to use system ninja, instead of using: `./ninja -C build install`, simply use `ninja -C build install`.

Deployability,"Hello @aditya12398 ,. The fifth line of the file you attached shows a call to `c++`, rather than `mpicxx`, which could cause those undefined references. Basically, the linker is not seeing your mpi libraries. I believe that, in order to use the `-Dcustom-mpi=true` flag, you may need to define your compiler environment variables (such as `$CC`, `$CXX`, `$LD`, `$MPICXX`, etc). Having both OpenMPI and MPICH installed on your system is complicating things, I think. Without some manual configuration of your system's environment, it may not be clear to meson/ninja which mpi implementation should be used.

Deployability,"Hello,. I have now added a basic FVM implementation to solve a general Poisson problem. The existing Poisson solver used a FEM based discretization but we needed a FVM based discretization to maintain numerical consistency when the momentum equations and Poisson equation for pressure are coupled. The FVM based solver is now working but some work still remains (like output formatting, history files.. etc). I used a pseudo-time approach and Euler explicit and implicit schemes fortime integration. The source term and the boundary conditions (Dirichlet and Neumann) are all hard coded for now. The next step would be to use the multigrid methods to solve the Poisson problem directly instead of the pseudo-time approach. .

Generally, the users tend to use the percent value (because nearly every paper on the subject talk in percentages) for turbulence intensitirs, so for example, if the experimental conditions say 3% for the turbulence intensity, the option in the config file should be 3.0. But now with this 100* modification, the users must enter 0.03, is that correct? . If it is correct, then transition test case/tutorial config files should be updated as well. Because the transition onset correlations (Menter or Abu-Ghannam) uses the percent value. .

Deployability,"Here's my best guess at what is happening: we are not correctly identifying the complete set of neighbors along intersections of two or more periodic boundaries (maybe duplicates, or maybe missing some neighbors). Without the correct stencil, GG will be incorrect due to integrating over the wrong control volume (repeated faces or missing faces). It also needs the correct volume for division in the GG evaluation. LSQ gets away with it most likely because the stencil can be defined independently of the actual set of neighbors (doesn't need to be a closed control volume) - if you miss a neighbor or duplicate a neighbor, you should end up with a similar answer. WLSQ may also get away with it, but with the weighting by inverse distance of the neighbor, you could still see some artifacts in the solution with missing/duplicate neighbors. If you have some time, can you take a look at the periodic matching routines and periodic communication preprocessing? The routines are sort of nasty, since the identification is not so straightforward in a vertex-based code with the DoFs on the boundary, but I expect we are missing something there still with intersecting periodic boundaries.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1090#issuecomment-727639514:271,integrat,integrating,271,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1090#issuecomment-727639514,1,['integrat'],['integrating']

Deployability,"Hi @TobiKattmann, thanks for your review. I'll try to do what I can within this week as I don't have much time from next week. > Hi Yuki, Thanks for this contribution bouquet I have a few comments in the review. You didn't write the code initially but it might still be good idea to make the code a bit nicer overall. In case there are things that are not understandable please let me know. As for things that I don't understand, see below although I would like to separate them from this PR.; - WeightNF.dat; - I don't understand what this is for. It is read in `CAdjEulerSolver::SetIntBoundary_Jump` to calculate derivative, so it is used for adjoint calculation? My understanding is that at least discrete adjoint does not need to calculate derivative. Is it for continuous adjoint?; - VENKATAKRISHNAN limiter; - With MARKER_NEARFIELD defined, this limiter causes strange pressure disturbance near the nearfield boundary. I tried to find a cause but no luck so far. (That's why I'm using VAN_ALBADA_EDGE in the test cases.); - `Bad match for point 47742.

Deployability,"Hi @aditya12398 . That would be helpful as it has been a bit difficult to identify the problem between versions of the code that have a lot of differences. As mentioned in my prev message, one of these differences is the MUSCL implementation and I am leaving this out for now. If you could ran the case attached in the following manner, would be useful:. - sending cfg files invbb_old_711.cfg and invbb_old_751.cfg (for versions 7.1.1 and 7.5.1 respectively) + mesh file blunt_91.su2; - could you run 2 simulations, one with 7.1.1 another with 7.5.1 with those cfg files pls?. MUSCL is disabled, so if we obtained very different results between those 2 simulations we have a good hint that the problem is not MUSCL. and we can then decide what to do next.

Deployability,"Hi All; I’m a bit worried about the logistics related to checking this v&v data base for every new release.; Unlike the tutorials, these cases, by their nature will be large and will require long integrations(the 2D cases might not fall on this category). This means also that significant computational resources will be required for this evaluation (about twice a year for a growing list of cases). Is it practical?; The only way that I think that it might work is that each contributor will be responsible for checking the casesthat he has introduced, before each release. Being a voluntary institution, this can not be enforced (and we do not want to enforce). How about trying to be less demanding:; In each validation case there will be a statement about the last version that it was checked with and the responsible contributor.

Deployability,"Hi Antonio, thanks for the review! . Precisely, the point of this PR is to ease generalization of multi-zone, multi-instance problems. For this reason, I am currently working on a branch putting together a CMultizoneDriver, which should be generic enough to accommodate problems involving complex multiphysics. The situation is now that there are a lot of hard-coded constraints, in order for specific features to work. FSI is an example itself; it requires a very strict way of setting up the problem. The same happens with other features such as Multizone HB. While this is ok for showcasing the features, I don't think it's a sustainable approach. For example, if we were to do Turbomachinery FSI, with the current structure it wouldn't be feasible. It would require a ""CTurbomachineryFSIDriver"" class, and more hard coded assumptions. My goal is to get rid of these bottlenecks, by leveraging on the class structure of SU2. Of course, this will require work, but I think it will pay off in the long run. This PR is just a starting point: SU2_DEF, SU2_DOT, etc, will need to be updated accordingly in next stages, together with other changes that are also necessary in the optimization framework and the core code to get rid of a lot of hacks here and there.

Deployability,"Hi David,; Yes, I was able to figure out that and I went ahead in trying to make fsi_computation.py work with this branch. Another error (which may be a bug actually ) occurs when the wrapped function **SetInitialMesh()** is run. This directly involves the core of SU2 as I found out the error is given during the run of the function **CILUPreconditioner** (inside **matrix_structure.cpp**) which, as much I understood, builds the preconditioning matrix for the solution of the linear system at the base of the mesh deforming procedure. . SU2 uses by default **ILU** precoditioner whose relative function (see above) has remarkable differences from the Raven release (I didn't go too much into details). Same error I get if using **Jacobi** preconditioner. ; At contrary, everything seems fine if using **LU_SGS** preconditioner and the fsi_computation.py finally works. Maybe it's the case to point it out to the developers inveloved in this part of the code. About your last point, I'm developing at the moment some FSI features and I very much relied on fsi_computation.py in defining the interface with the SU2 core.

Deployability,"Hi Economon,. I encountered an issue very similar to what Auzbaig reported: the error message ""OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION: invalid option value EntropyGeneration"" during optimization with SU2. (I am using SU2 version 8.0.1 ""Harrier.""). After thoroughly examining the existing Python optimization framework, I found that one of the steps in the optimization chain is generating different config.cfg files, with a focus on DV_VALUE and OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION. DV_VALUE controls the geometry deformation;; OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION determines the type of objective/constraints.; Then the framework calls SU2_CFD and SU2_DOT to obtain performance metrics or gradient information.; As you mentioned, ""You might need to run updateHistoryMap.py to register new outputs with Python."" Initially, I thought it meant simply providing a new input for OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION in the Python optimization framework. However, it seems that this may not work at the C++ level. To verify this, I ran $ SU2_CFD your_config.cfg -d and observed all available history outputs. However, I suspect that OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION cannot use every history output, meaning that the adjoint solver might not recognize some objective functions. Does this imply that additional modifications in the C++ code are required?. Additionally, I would appreciate more information regarding CUSTOM_OBJFUNC. From TestCases/user_defined_functions/lam_flatplate.cfg, I understand that CUSTOM_OBJFUNC allows combinations of existing OBJECTIVE_FUNCTIONs and can also utilize CUSTOM_OUTPUTS. The flexibility of CUSTOM_OUTPUTS seems to enable the construction of various desired variables. However, I am unsure whether using OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION= CUSTOM_OBJFUNC along with CUSTOM_OUTPUTS can entirely replace the need for additional modifications in the C++ code. Since I’m not very proficient in C++, I would greatly appreciate your guidance.

Deployability,"Hi Eduardo,. both, 'symmetry plane' and 'symmetry as the slip wall' should work in the code (upon fixing this) and it should be made clear (e.g. in the config_template.cfg) what the BC is suitable for, independent of how it is named in the end. ; The simplest solution is probably the patch I provided together with a short note in the config_template (maybe even a reference to this issue), as both 'options' will work as expected (using the very same code). It will basically 'restore' the behaviour of MARKER_SYM of before the fix in #657. The downside is some more computational cost (in case of a plane) which has to be done for each vertex on the marker. I cant say to which extend this takes more time but I would guess it is not too costly. Depends on the case as well. I can do a little check with your case here. . That's it for the diplomatic part :) (Please take the following with a grain). For me a symmetry has to be a line or plane. To cite Jiri Blazek's book 'Computational Fluid Dynamics'(...) 3rd edition using a screenshot:. ![blazekbook](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31306376/61662377-9ab05a80-acce-11e9-85bf-5998db204d92.png). The chapter is called 'symmetry plane' which already is kinda biased. But there is no 'slip wall for viscous flow' mentioned to my knowledge. In another book (from Ferziger&Peric, which I only have in german) symmetry is only used in the context of symmetry planes as well. ; To me, symmetry BC's are also linked to visualization using mirroring. And mirroring (as the word is commonly meant) is only possible along planes and its little brother, the straight line. I can be wrong or it might be a question of research background. So how to proceed? Trial by combat might have some unpleasant aftermath for the winner so we might go the democratic way and do a poll :) .

Deployability,"Hi Floris,. Can you clarify whether you are using the continuous or discrete adjoint?. One thing that I am noticing in your results above is the large difference in magnitude between the compressible and incompressible sensitivities on the surface, which could require very different scaling later when that info is sent to the optimizer... . I would recommend running the discrete adjoint to get sensitivities for lift/drag w.r.t. the same set of design variables for both the compressible and incompressible solvers and comparing the result (with a nearly incompressible flow so the conditions are basically the same). This way, you can remove the scaling for optimization that is part of the shape_optimization.py script and focus only on the gradient results first. You could use the discrete_adjoint.py script for this.

Deployability,"Hi Lorena,. Sorry for the delay getting back to you. You are right, and the TestCases repository is starting to be huge, mainly because of the stuff that GitHub generates to track the files. Easy to maintain/access alternatives are very welcome. Some releases ago, the grids were in another place (or lab server) and in Github we only had the config files, unfortunately we checked that for some users it was frustrating to download the config files and then go to another place to download the grids. From our practical point of view, the current setting is ideal to run the regression tests. But we are open to any change that benefits the SU2 users/developers community. . Now, it is very easy to download and modify the TestCases (keep in mind that the options in the config files change frequently) but, the price to pay is a large GitHub repository that it is difficult to download if you don’t have a good internet connection. Anyway, I think you are coming to Stanford in one week, it would be great to chat with you. We would love to have you and your group as a SU2 developer/user. Looking forward to meeting you and thanks for testing SU2. Best; Francisco. ## .

Deployability,"Hi Pedro, ; As discussed last week, I now translate and rotate the whole aircraft in the elastic mesh in combination with a farfield onflow. Implementing and doing the coordinate transformations right took me a few hours, but now everything seems to work properly and fast :). 1. Currently, activating the gust resets/overwrites the grid velocities due to the deformed mesh, but I haven't found the place yet. Any ideas?. 2. Should I clean up / remove the split velocity approach as described in the first post or would you like to keep it?. 4. How to handle the new approach, should I close this pull request and open a new one? There are a few commits which I needed to undo. 5. Generally, I still need the rotating frame approach for steady maneuver load cases, e.g. to calculate the pitching, rolling or yawing aircraft in a steady simulation. The acceleration terms are zero in this case, but I understood that the Coriolis-Term with omega x velocity is missing. Is that correct? I guess they are probably important for objects like a propeller which spins at a couple of thousand RPMs but maybe it is justified to neglect them for slow objects?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1954#issuecomment-1505397240:797,rolling,rolling,797,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1954#issuecomment-1505397240,2,['rolling'],['rolling']

I'm expecting one has to assemble a ""bigger"" residual across the disciplines (or a routine that has the same functionality as a multiplication with it, like Algorithm 4 on page 943 in the paper from Kenway, Kennedy and Martins or what you are doing in `CNewtonIntegration::MatrixFreeProduct`, I guess) :-)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1183#issuecomment-773349903:150,integrat,integration,150,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1183#issuecomment-773349903,1,['integrat'],['integration']
Deployability,"Hi Pedro, sorry I'd forgotten to get to that one. I've just had a look through the logic again. Inside SetAiken_Relaxation, the predicted velocity is set which I think should keep the velocity update to be within the same time iteration, but if you think this still isn't actually the case let me know. Also, I've just spotted that inside Update in CFEAIteration, the logic for dynamic and/or fsi isn't complementary, so the separate ""else if"" handling for ImplicitNewmark_Relaxation isn't actually called at all. The SetDualTime_Solver which is called earlier in the same function in turn calls ImplicitNewmark_Relaxation so this hadn't been spotted earlier. I've removed the redundant else if statement... I've had to reintroduce this back since the regression tests for discadj_fsi and discadj_fsi_airfoil failed, which was a bit surprising since they are static fsi problems and the statements removed only considered problems with Newmark time integration.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1174#issuecomment-822094705:193,update,update,193,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1174#issuecomment-822094705,3,"['Update', 'integrat', 'update']","['Update', 'integration', 'update']"
Deployability,"Hi Pedro, thanks for looking into this more. I had run into inconsistencies for FSI problems with relaxation which was the reason for the domain specific calls coming into the multizone driver Update function. With the changes I introduced, the velocity at the interface was being transferred correctly with and without relaxation, so I left it there but it is a bit messy. I'll test with the modified calls for the Relaxation as you suggest. I completely agree that if we can simplify the velocity transfer by just using the velocity directly, then we should.

Deployability,"Hi Pedro,. I tried the other solution you suggested. I declared a new private variable inside the solver class, which I assigned as config->cb1_usrdef. I registered this as the AD input. I then set a method inside the solver class which returns this value when called.; In the Numerics class, instead of reading cb1 from Config as I used to, I read it from the Solver class, using the method mentioned above.; Now I couldn't create a Solver object inside numerics_structure.inl, since according to the compilation order the solver class is dependant on the numerics class (Solver_structure.hpp includes numerics_structure.hpp). So the compiler doesn't know about the solver class while inside the numerics.; To work around the compiler error, instead I included the solver header file inside the numerics src files (cpp). I then created the solver objects in the relevant numerics functions and called the method which returns the AD-registered cb1 variable.; This all compiles now, but the AD gradient is still returned as 0. Adding print statements to the functions inside the numerics src files revealed that they are getting a cb1 value of 0, which I assume it's because solver_adjoint_discrete.cpp is called after the numerics src files have read the value of cb1, which at that point would be 0.; Would you agree that it's probably best to update the numerics classes inside the adjoint iteration class for CDiscAdjSolver, similar to what's done inside CDiscAdjFEAIteration?

Probably you need to update the value of the test_case config and set the relaxation to 1.0 to recover the previous test. ; About the symmetric matrix class: Joel's implementation was indeed intended to populate the matrix needed for the RBF; the CSysMatrix would not be able to accommodate some terms due to the sparsity. It's well explained in the comments. Also, his implementation was only single-core.

Deployability,"Hi Ruben, no worries. Integrating on the fluid side is what makes sense for matching meshes, less hassle given the availability of dual grid information, no need for MPI boiler plate, etc. The adjoint implications are being accounted for, this integration step is being recorded and overall the dependencies have not changed, the fluid nodes are still the ones defining the direction of the stress.; As you can see from the files I attached, the sensitivities are very similar for conservative/consistent interpolation cases. . It is not possible to generalise this for conservative interpolation (i.e. using the transpose of the displacement interpolation matrix to interpolate tractions) because that approach implicitly takes care of the (possible) different areas associated with fluid and solid nodes. If you transfer stresses with conservative interpolation and then integrate you get the wrong force. The conservative approach requires forces to be transferred, otherwise we start taking liberties with the meaning of the word :).

Deployability,"Hi all,. This is definitely good discussion... everything goes toward multi-physics nowadays, so we should always be improving the class design accordingly. I suppose this will just get more important with adding more physics, zones, and more complex time integration schemes. I would like to highlight that when the code was first released, we did not have ""zones"" at all (not until some early sliding mesh work after a couple of versions), and the CDriver and CIteration classes didn't even exist until we dreamed them up a couple of years ago. My point is that, with some proper planning, we have the creativity and the right team to develop the solution we need, and we shouldn't be afraid to make big changes when necessary. Moving quickly while leveraging the team's broad skillset is one of our biggest advantages in this project. As you all know, over the years, we continue to move toward a *_structure.cpp and *_physics.cpp mindset for how we do our abstractions/data encapsulations, with ""structure"" components reused and ""physics"" components being specialized to a certain set of governing equations. This has happened in many places, including recently with the CTransfer class, for instance, and it is likely to happen with the COutput class(es) before long. However, one area where there hasn't been much evolution is within the CIntegration classes. Apart from a couple of additions for structural problems and now the DG integration, it is largely the same as it was in the first release. Perhaps this is our opportunity to rethink and update these classes for future expansion, just as we've done for others over the years. We could rework them, move them up or down in the hierarchy, change where they're instantiated, change the inheritance, and so on. Even if they get a little more complicated (like usual), as long as they're properly abstracted, it isn't likely to bother the developers working in other areas of the code too much. In short, I think some effort spent on the CI",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/437#issuecomment-329078585:256,integrat,integration,256,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/437#issuecomment-329078585,2,"['integrat', 'release']","['integration', 'released']"

Deployability,"Hi all,; really interesting topic going on here. As @pcarruscag just very well explained, and after quite some time working on the code, I can totally see the need for dense algebra. . I agree with @juanjosealonso and @erangit that maintaining the code portable and very easy to install should be a must. It has been a signature of SU2 since the beginning and we should continue on that line. I've had some problems before with codes that rely heavily on PETSc, so I wouldn't particularly be keen to go down that road. . **Eigen** would be really easy to integrate in SU2: they have a mirror on GitHub here: [Eigen Github repo](https://github.com/eigenteam/eigen-git-mirror) which could be easily added as a submodule in the same way as CoDiPack or MeDiPack. Given that they are only header files, there would be no need to compile any external library. And there is another very important point made by @vdweide and @pcarruscag: we need to ensure compatibility with the discrete adjoint functionality. One huge advantage of Eigen is that is fully templated: we recently differentiated a code that was heavy reliant on Eigen in an afternoon, and it worked great. While LAPACK is indeed a very mature library, I believe that it would require using external functions for every functionality, which would be a really big burden. @talbring @MaxSagebaum could add some more hints in this discussion.

Deployability,"Hi there,. I went ahead and created a dummy geometry, that is:; 1. I altered the planform so that the sweep, twist, dihedral, taper... are now different from the actual wing; 2. I replaced the airfoil by the NASA SC(2)-0712. The dummy wing has a double planform defined as:; - semi span = [5; 10]; - taper = [0.55; 0.35]; - dihedral angle = [5°; 2.5°]; - twist angle = [1°; 0°; -1°] (given for root, kink and tip airfoil sections); - sweep angle at LE = 25°; - Aspect ratio = 11.8; - semi area = 38. I defined the reference length as:; - reference (semi) area = 45; - reference chord = 3; - reference (semi) span = 15. The flight conditions remained unchanged:; - Mach number: 0.78; - Temperature = ~217 K; - Reynolds number: ~19 millions; - AoA = 0°. I created the exact same grid as before (same number of cells, same progression), ensuring my first cell was at y+<1. Things is, this time, SU2 did not have any trouble converging and computed the right z-projected area... I checked the results with another software and the pressure distribution (taken along the chord near the kink) match, see attached Figure. I am attaching the dummy configuration file (dum.txt) as well as the mesh (dum_mesh.txt) if it can be of interest to you. The mesh is a .geo gmsh file. To get the mesh, simply open with gmsh and click mesh 3D (or, from the console: gmsh dum_mesh.txt -3).

Deployability,"Hi, I've seen this with some (one) cgns file but not others (larger ones), for example I never had any issue with the finest HL-CRM reference grids on nodes with 128 cores.; I suspect this has something to do with how the files are generated, but I did not investigate further. I think the HL-CRM are made by Pointwise but I do not know the export settings used, do let us know if you find a solution.; Regarding the ASCII format, we have recently improved the mesh reader (in the develop branch), if you are generating the file yourself, and if you list the ""points"" before the ""elements"" in the file, it may be up to 4 times faster to read it.; Finally, the file systems used in the clusters of some very fine institutions are absolute trash (not saying this is your case, just making you aware of the fact), and they respond very badly to having many cores reading the same file. Especially for ASCII because here all cores read the entire file, and not just some sections.; If you run the hybrid parallel version of SU2 this will be less of a problem because fewer cores will be participating in file-IO (but all of them will still be used for computation).; https://su2code.github.io/docs_v7/Build-SU2-Linux-MacOS/#basic-configuration; https://su2foundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Gomes.pdf; Cheers,; Pedro",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1378#issuecomment-924779452:1226,configurat,configuration,1226,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1378#issuecomment-924779452,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"Hi, thanks for this interesting discussion. Just a reminder... there is a third place where the default values are stored! the config_template.cfg file. I have had similar problems to what @erangit is describing with the multiple definition of the default values in different places, in fact, sometimes is not clear what is the minimum number of parameters that you can use in a config file. I think that the ideal scenario would be to use the config_template.cfg file as the default value keeper and create subroutines in C++ and python that update the defaults with the existing information in that file. Remember that config_template.cfg is always required otherwise the user doesn't know that are the existing options. By the way... this discussion reminds me that we should update SetRunTime_Options(void). This is an incredible useful small subroutine to modify the software parameters during runtime.

My suggestion is to create the following parameter:; % Residual convergence criteria equation (RHO, RHO_VEL, RHO_ENERGY); RESIDUAL_FUNC_FLOW= RHO.

Deployability,"Hi,. The structure of fsi_computation.py is completely different from the one of parallel_computation(_fsi).py, this one is just a script that, if I am right, will set for you the commands in order to launch SU2_CFD in parallel and SU2_SOL right after. It is based on system calls ( it is like calling mpirun -np xx SU2_CFD SU2conf.cfg and mpirun -np xx SU2_SOL SU2conf.cfg). The fsi_computation.py has to be considered as an executable, and thus has to be launched with the mpirun command for parallel run:. $ mpirun -np XX fsi_computation.py -f FSIConfig.cfg --parallel. You have to specify the FSI configuration file (see examples in TestCase) with -f, and the --parallel option is mandatory (only if SU2 has been built in parallel). XX is the number of procs.

Deployability,"Hi,. Unfortunately the logic is quite confuse but I think that part of the code is correct, SU2 just want to use an updated version of the limiter for the turbulence variables. ` if (config->GetSpatialOrder() == SECOND_ORDER_LIMITER) SetSolution_Limiter(geometry, config);; `; and for the flow variables. ` if (limiter_flow) solver_container[FLOW_SOL]->SetPrimitive_Limiter(geometry, config);; `. Another story is if that is really worth it and we should use the values from the previous iteration. Remember that we compute the turbulence variables after updating the flow variables... so... from the theoretical point of view it makes sense to have an updated value for the limiter. However this is not 100% accurate because we are using old gradients to compute the new limiter. Anyway, the spirit is to have a limiter computed using the latest flow variables value and we should probably check that the gradients have been also updated before computing limiters again for the turbulence equation. What I don't really like is Upwind_Residual. ` bool limiter = (config->GetSpatialOrder() == SECOND_ORDER_LIMITER);; `. in this case we are using only the info about limiters or not in the turbulence model... so if, for example, we are using JST for the mean flow equations then the limiter for the flow equations have never been computed and. ```; if (limiter) {; FlowPrimVar_i[iVar] = V_i[iVar] + Limiter_i[iVar]*Project_Grad_i;; FlowPrimVar_j[iVar] = V_j[iVar] + Limiter_j[iVar]*Project_Grad_j;; }. ``` . Is incorrect because Limiter_i has never been computed (if we are lucky maybe we are using a zero value by default... but we need to check). In other words, I think this require a deeper look. @jschuele, could you please think on this and submit a new pull request (I'll close this one).

Is there gone be any update on the PYAMG side to use version SU2-7?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/606#issuecomment-578501709:322,update,update,322,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/606#issuecomment-578501709,1,['update'],['update']

The effect of COMBINE_OBJECTIVE is a flag to switch between treating the objectives separately (each objective and its gradient is evaluated separately and the python scripts loop sequentially over the objectives, or if this option is 'YES' then a 'COMBO' value is output to the history file and the gradient is computed all-at-once (I can explain that more offline if necessary)). At the moment this only works for linear combinations of existing objectives, so the sample objective Francisco listed would be beyond that. . What do you think of this as an option structure for minimizing 0.1*DRAG-2.0*LIFT:; OPT_OBJECTIVE = COMBINATION; ...; OBJFUNC_ADJFLOW = COMBINATION; ..; COMBO_OBJDEF = DRAG, LIFT; COMBO_OBJWEIGHT = 0.1, -2.0; Where this would still be compatible with looping over sequential objectives in the shape optimization (that is really just a fairly small update to the python, and has some benefits depending on how many constraints you have), and both the adjoint and optimization would refer to OBJDEF if 'COMBINATION' is set as the objective.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/241#issuecomment-187280368:1453,update,update,1453,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/241#issuecomment-187280368,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"I came across this when I was working on a mesh generation program that generates an extruded boundary layer. I had checks in the program to make sure I was generating elements of positive volume and that they weren't self intersecting. While some of the elements were very badly skewed, I knew I didn't want the elements to be reoriented. However, SU2 reorients several of the prisms and tries to reorient some of the pyramids as well (which isn't a defined operation in SU2). . This is why in my particular case it was easier for me to just turn off the feature. . In general though, I think that the reorientation check could be a bit better. Currently for the prism element for example, it does a volume like calculation using the top and bottom triangles separately, and reorients if either one is negative. Obviously if only one of these calculations is negative, by reorienting, the other calculation would become negative. Similar things are done for pyramids and hexas. . A simple solution would be to change the ""or"" conditions in these calculations to ""and"", so that it is only reoriented if it fails all the checks. I think a better solution would be to decide on a volume calculation method for each element type, and then use that as a criteria. .

Deployability,"I do have some issues with the continuous adjoint Testcases. Taking for example the euler_wedge. In the primal, results/convergence are really close. The continuous adjoint case (contadj_wedge) however produces pretty different results especially along the Euler walls (will upload an image later). The cont.adj. case converges though. So I guess I am doing missing something which is specific to the continuous adjoint? ; Maybe someone with experience in that field can help me and take a look. @hlkline maybe?. Update: Fixed the problem -> I had to change the call signature of the base implementation of `BC_Euler_Wall `and I changed it for all the primal solvers but not the continuous adjoint solver.

Deployability,"I have a few updates. I found out that most of my FGMRES problems in this branch where related to the fact that I was using single precision for the linear system.

The first two curves are in mixed-precision and they stop long before reaching the minimum residual required due to divergence of the linear solver. Moreover, it seems that the 2003 model here implemented (which, simply put, considers the full reynolds stress tensor for the computation of the production of k and always considers k in the stress tensor and in the thermodynamic variables) has faster convergence and increases the recirculating zone (maybe due to the reduction of turbulence kinetic energy) which is a feature that has also been seen in [DOI:10.1017/aer.2020.93]. . ![SFC_Mesh_3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81a50021-6b58-4a84-9057-a18b5bab023c).

Deployability,"I haven't explicitly checked if they match but for the rigid motion cases the grid velocity is calculated from the transformation matrices and then imposed to update the grid. Therefore if the grid velocities are back calculated from the grid using FD then I would expect them to be close but not exact. For a pitching airfoil case with FFD design variables, the average difference in gradients for an objective function of L/D was within 1% between discrete adjoint and finite differences. This is very similar for both imposed grid velocities in the adjoint preprocessing and with the FD calculation for the grid velocities. So I think the results are pretty reliable for the rigid motion cases using the updated grid velocities calculation. . The deforming grid on the other hand is a different story.

This makes a lot more sense to me than using what seems to be an arbitrary algorithm to determine if the elements should be reoriented. . I came across this when I was writing a 3d mesh generator. It doesn't create elements of the best quality but I made sure that they had a positive volume. SU2 would then reorient some elements on me, which caused even more issues for the meshes I created . .

This approach is very similar to Boost's setup. Google Test does not offer a header-only version. Additionally, the developer plans to drop C++11 support, and move to C++14. A simpler branch will still support C++03. It's not clear which features are supported in the C++03 variant, and which ones aren't.

I'm writing this post just in case anyone else runs into this problem on a cluster computer where they may not have the ability to change or install different compilers or c/c++ libraries. The problem stems from the version of cstdlib (or stdlib.h) and the c++ (or c) standard that is specified. alligned_alloc was not introduced in c++11, it was introduced in c11, and didn't make it into the c++ standard until c++17. My understanding is that basically, if stdlib.h is used, and the c (not c++) standard is set to 2011 or greater, aligned_alloc should appear in the global namespace. If cstdlib is used and the c++ standard is set to 2017 or greater, then aligned_alloc will appear in the std namespace. Also, I believe if the c++ standard is set to 2017 or greater, and stdlib.h is used, aligned_alloc will also appear in the global namespace. However, there were several gcc compiler releases (including up to 7.3) that did not have aligned_alloc as part of the std:: namespace. Apparently, this bug was fixed in gcc 7.4 and up.

This is something we don't usually check for, especially in paraview output since most of us don't use that.

Deployability,"I think the way the prefix is set up is fine. My suggestion is more about where things go under $prefix. For python scripts meant to be used as executables... I'd put these directly under `$prefix/bin`, e.g. on my system, `/usr/bin/foo.py` and be sure that foo.py has execute permission. Python modules meant to be imported ... I'd put these in <somewhere>/python3.x/site-packages or let pip decide where to put them. So `foo.py` could end up in two different places, I guess.

Whereby /usr/lib64/python3.9/site-packages is right for my system, but other systems will have their own place to install modules. That's where I suspect pip might be helpful.

Deployability,"I was looking a bit more into this because of the issue with having to treat the structural solver differently in the Update function.; (I gotta say I feel lucky I never had to look into time domain stuff, because 3 nested iterations... not easy). Anyway, I think there is a problem here, the ""predicted displacement"" that is transferred to the fluid during outer iterations (the coupling iterations within each time iteration) is the one set in CFEASolver::SetAitken_Relaxation, which is part of the Corrector step at the end of the structural inner iterations (the ones within each outer iteration). The ""predicted velocity"" is not set in SetAitken_Relaxation thus the grid velocities are lagged by one time step, since they are only set to the current velocity of the structure at the end of the time step (in the Update methods). I have little trust in the predictor step, looking at it I thing only zero order has a chance of working and anything else will cause the fluid and structural sides to separate / overlap, I'll test the theory.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1174#issuecomment-774712415:118,Update,Update,118,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1174#issuecomment-774712415,2,['Update'],['Update']

Deployability,"I'll have the summary at the bottom, you guys read papers you know to look for the conclusions.; ## Global speedup (Conclusions); I took the expected speedups for each prototyped area of the code and applied them to the profile I measured for the benchmark case from #716 / #753 (which is not very linear solver intensive).; It is hard to estimate the effect of fusing the convective and viscous edge loops, I assumed the cheaper of the two becomes ""free"" and the other gets a speedup of 1.5 (speedup should be 1.85 accounting for the matrix update optimizations).; I assumed that gradients and limiters are not fused and that minor areas of the code get no speedup, which is not necessarily true as this work would require contiguous storage of geometric properties (geometry->node and geometry->edge) and so some speedup is expected due to that, but in the absence of evidence I prefer to be conservative.; Here are the numbers:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38071223/66394872-15376f00-e9ce-11e9-80ed-193aea2aae6f.png); The take home number is **1.7**. Cumulative with the 1.4 from contiguous storage, so 2.4 total. Despite most of my posts being focused on SIMD my main motivation is the hybrid parallelization which will allow important algorithmic improvements when running on hundreds of cores, namely the multigrid and additive linear preconditioners will retain their effectiveness at much larger core counts.; I will not hazard an estimate for this. ## Proposed changes (Summary); **Hybrid parallel**; - Gradients (GG) and limiters converted to point loops (embarrassing parallel, no edge colouring needed).; - Residual loops parallelized with edge colouring, if anyone has suggestions regarding algorithms send them my way, so far I only tested greedy colouring on edge groups to preserve spatial locality (this aspect is absolutely fundamental).; - Matrix multiplication, BCSR format is also embarrassing parallel.; - Linear preconditioners, additive decomposition wit",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-539523312:542,update,update,542,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-539523312,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"It seems like your situation may have been resolved, but for archival purposes, I'll list my workaround here. This problem occurs when you've installed python packages in two different locations. This could be due to installing some python packages in a system directory (e.g. `/usr/lib/`) and some in a user directory (e.g. `~/.local/`). SU2's build process is set to automatically detect the default package location, but it's not equipped to handle multiple package locations. There are some hardcoded includes, but these only work for python 2.7. I don't consider this a bug *per se* because multiple python package directories is not a standard use case. #### The symptoms. When building SU2 with the python wrapper you'll see the following error during the swig build:; ```; <install directory>/../SU2_PY/pySU2/pySU2.i:64: Error: Unable to find 'mpi4py/mpi4py.i'; ```; But mpi4py is indeed installed on your system and it's on your python path, as confirmed by opening a python terminal and running `import mpi4py`. #### The easiest workaround. Switch to a [virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). This will ensure that all of your python packages are stored in single location. #### Alternate workaround. In this method, you change the hardcoded includes to match mpi4py's package location. First I figure out where my mpi4py is installed. I start a terminal session of python using the python environment I want to use (in this case, it's python 3.6), and then run:; ```; from mpi4py import MPI; MPI; ```. Since I have mpi4py installed on your system and it's on my python path, I see something like:; ```; <module 'mpi4py.MPI' from '/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mpi4py/MPI.cpython-34m.so'>; ```. The `/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python3.6/` directory is where my mpi4py package is installed. But the swig compile command includes `/home/clarkpede/.local/lib/python2.7/`. That's not the right directory!

E.g., if you are interested in a wing, you can apply integration to the wall there, but apply wall functions on the fuselage.

Deployability,"Juan,. Indeed, it is desirable that at the highest level the details of the time integration scheme and number of zones per discipline should not be visible. The question is whether that is achievable for all combinations you can think of. This is especially the case for the time integration schemes. E.g. suppose you would like to use a multi-stage time integration scheme for a multi-physics problem. To obtain the design accuracy in time, this implies that the loop over the number of time stages is outside the loop over the number of physical disciplines. Hence at a very high level in the hierarchy, the details of the time integration should then be known. The situation becomes even more complicated when one would like to employ time integration schemes that allow for time accurate local time stepping, e.g. the ones we are currently working on for the DG solver. I won't bore you with all the details here, but those schemes basically require the loop over the multiple disciplines to be between the predictor and corrector step, while both these steps consist of multiple stages. Although it is probably possible to come up with a data structure that supports all this, the question is whether this is desirable. Apart from the fact that it would require a major overhaul in the high level design of SU2, the implementation will be less readable, especially for people that will be starting with the code. Also the parallelization may become significantly more complicated. The alternative is that for unsteady multi-physics problems, we put the restriction that only single stage time integration schemes can be used, e.g. DT_STEPPING_1ST and DT_STEPPING_2ND. In that case, the details of the time integration scheme can be hidden at the driver level, where we then simply have a loop over the number of physical disciplines. The consequence of course is that more advanced time integration schemes will not be available for multi-physics problems. In the above I just tried to picture w",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/437#issuecomment-328441926:81,integrat,integration,81,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/437#issuecomment-328441926,10,['integrat'],['integration']

This problem is not present when using mpiexec. I traced it back and found that in CFVMFlowSolverBase<V, FlowRegime>::Friction_Forces the method GetNormal_Neighbor() from CVertex returns a non existing point. I was able to partially reproduce this with @suargi's help, by modifying `SU2/TestCases/rans/rae2822/turb_SA_RAE2822.cfg`, setting MGLEVEL=6 (instead of 3) and MGCYCLE=FULLMG_CYCLE (instead of W_CYCLE). This could become the new regression test by the way. Both with `mpirun -n 3` and `mpiexec -n 3` we observed non-existing point IDs of the normal neighbor. In #1430 I describe what I think is the problem. For `mpirun -n 2` and `mpiexec -n 2` I get another kind of error, I'll further investigate this.

On the subject of de-swizzling data remember I said the writes into CSysMatrix would be a bit weird, that is because each Jacobian contribution will be a ""matrix of short arrays"" that needs to be transformed into a short array of matrices, the result of that is code like the above that explicitly manipulates the lanes of our SIMD type, such code can be completely hidden inside CSysMatrix which is good because a 4x4 vectorized transpose and matrix update looks like this; ```c++; // block j, subs from jj and goes to ij; T0 = blk_j[ k ].unpackLo(blk_j[k+1]); T1 = blk_j[ k ].unpackHi(blk_j[k+1]);; T2 = blk_j[k+2].unpackLo(blk_j[k+3]); T3 = blk_j[k+2].unpackHi(blk_j[k+3]);.

Deployability,"Nice analysis @clarkpede. It is true that we simplify the Jacobians at the periodic boundaries, mostly to avoid issues with adding entries to the Jacobian from the neighbors that potentially do not live on our rank and to keep communication costs low (those neighbors are treated explicitly). This could be changed to communicate the full Jacobian.. but I am not sure it is worth the effort/cost. The approximation that is made should still be consistent though, because we only allow one of the repeated periodic nodes to participate in the linear solve with each nonlinear iteration, and then we communicate its update to its periodic pair. In short, the value of the solution should always be the same on periodic points with each iteration update, and if the problem converges to a steady-state (even in time stepping mode), the Jacobian should only affect convergence (the RHS should be the same). You could try the time stepping option with one of the RK methods to see if going fully explicit helps further isolate the issue. It could also be something related to the time step that is communicated. In the SetTime_Step() routine in the flow solver class, we do some special checks for time stepping mode to make sure that the minimum global time step is used in all cells. Might want to print out the dT communicated in the periodic comms or write the dT to the solution file to make sure everything is ok there too. Honestly, I don't think a ton of folks use the time stepping option in general with the FVM solver, so double-checking that it behaves well for a non-periodic problem could shed some light too, unless you have already done that.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/763#issuecomment-524007345:614,update,update,614,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/763#issuecomment-524007345,4,['update'],['update']

Removing code from the main release is a complex task and, as in the past, I have taken tough decisions.

Basic criteria to maintain forever an implementation on the develop->master branch are: - Clear benefit to the CFD community (more accurate, robust, etc.) - Existing community of users or active developers - Minimal code documentation (at least the options should be in the config file). - Easy to install and use. - The implementation style should be aligned with the SU2 style - Regressions tests.

Deployability,"Ok, SIMD update, with #753, #959, and #966 we now have a unified storage type for the data we need in CNumerics. This means that we (I) only need to implement ""SIMD accessor methods"" (i.e. that return a SIMD type instead of a su2double) for one class (C2DContainer and co.). I think to do SIMD right we need a new way of going about CNumerics, these are my design requirements for ""CNewNumerics"":; - Thread-safe (consequently const-correct), a single object must be safe to use by multiple threads.; - Minimal indirection, the polymorphic overhead will be reduced to a single call (ComputeResidual), all auxiliary functions (like the ones that live in CNumerics) will be forcefully inlined, no useless copies of data (no more numerics->SetBlaBla).; - Compile time nDim/nVar, which will: a) avoid heap allocations; b) allow effective loop-unrolling (also during the writes to CSysMatrix).; - Allow low-overhead composition, e.g. have one CRoe for Euler and one CRoeVisc for NS to fuse convective and viscous residuals (without copy pasting code).; - A lot more readable, those cryptic V_i[iDim+1] need to go (somehow...). To achieve all this, the ""CNewNumerics"" will work as a template (obvs) decorator/visitor.; A visitor in the sense that the solver calls the numerics and gives it (read-only) access to all its data, the object pulls whatever it needs directly and there is no need for numerics->SetBlaBla.; A template decorator in the sense that the class can be augmented simply by inheriting from another, along the lines of `class CRoeVisc : public CRoe, public CVisc` (to allow fusing residual and Jacobian contributions).; All this needs to be done with templates for the ""minimal indirection"" requirement. Which means for each numerical method we will have 4 explicit template instantiations (Euler2D, Euler3D, (RA)NS2D, (RA)NS3D) but in the end these are still polymorphic objects that will be instantiated by some factory function (i.e. it will look clean, especially because I will not por",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-622941617:9,update,update,9,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-622941617,2,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"On both questions the answer is yes. Option 1 can be implemented right now but will require the creation of temporary objects. Option 2 can directly forward the data to the blas routines. The tool I am developing is no tool for a specific linear algebra package. The idea is, that the tool parses the header files of the library. The user has then to define which objects are active lvalues and the derivatives for each operation in the library. For small an clear interfaces this is no problem and works already quite good. For large libraries like Eigen I adopted a whitelisting approach. That is, every function needs to be manually whitelisted to trigger the expression generation of the tool. In a prototype way I have also implemented an approach where only the active lvalues need to be defined and the tool looks then for all required functions and other objects that depend on these active objects. Long story short, the tool is designed to handle ""any"" library. It is even possible to mix several libraries together. My current status on this project is, that I am now through with the parsing of the header files and the generation of the expressions. This works quite well for Eigen which is a hardcore testcase, since every possible programming tweak in C++ is used here. The next step is to add the AD part to the expression generation process.

Deployability,"Pete, Tim,. I have had a long standing interest in getting this working and would be happy to help. The (partial) implementation that is there is already 3-4 years old, so it will have to be updated, but we can discuss some of the details of the implementation and how it can be done both more efficiently and for both compressible formulations and adaptive wall functions. We can start a thread separately (jjalonso@stanford.edu<mailto:jjalonso@stanford.edu>) and perhaps have a telecon to kick things off. My availability for this improves after the next 2 weeks. Best,.

Maybe you could perturb the target value of CL instead and measure the variation of alpha for an imposed variation of CL but that is starting to sound quite strange.

Deployability,"Some updates:. - Python wrapper functionalities have been moved into a dedicated python_wrapper_structure.cpp file for code clarity.; - The data structures for the customized values at boundaries have been removed from the CPoint class. Data structures are stored in the geometry class, they are initialized only when customization is set ON and only for involved vertices. There was no restriction to put the data structures in the solver class, except that when multi-grids needs to be updated (required for non uniform field), the geometry class needed an access to the solver class, which is not the case since everything that is in the Common structure seems to be independent of what it is in SU2_CFD, and I wanted to keep that. Those data structures should not be seen as true PDE-related variables, they should be seen as a generic support for boundary customization.; - CHT related labels have been removed and replaced by ""Python customizable"" in order to not introduce any confusion with the native CHT development. The basic purpose of this work is to enable existing boudary conditions to be customized from Python and not to develop a CHT interface. CHT is just an example of application (since only the HEAT_FLUX and ISOTHERMAL walls are customizable for now).; - Based on the previous point, no new specific boundary condition was introduced. For now, I keep the idea to just modify (one single line) the existing boundary conditions to take into account the customization. New dedicated boundary conditions (for example BC_HEAT_FLUX_CUSTOM or BC_ISOTHERMAL_CUSTOM) would be a 99% copy of the originals... Dedicated boundary conditions for native CHT development can still be defined independently (no condlfict). Cheers,.

Deployability,"Sorry for my late reply and thanks Heather for opening this important discussion.; I fully agree with you and OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION and OPT_OBJECTIVE cause confusion. As far I see the problem, if we focus on a typical users point of view, I think that OPT_OBJECTIVE and OPT_CONSTRAINT must be in the config file and as close as possible. They are the key to define an optimization problem (one of the key features of SU2). On the other hand, as you suggested we need to add some flexibility. It would be interesting to to able to define a multi-objective like; OPT_OBJECTIVE= DRAG \* DRAG_WEIGHT; LIFT^2 \* LIFT^2_WEIGHT;. As Tim pointed out OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION is important because is what we use to play and develop the adjoint capability but, from the users point of view it is not as interesting as the OPT_OBJECTIVE. If everything works ok, OPT_OBJECTIVE should be enough for most of the SU2 users. How many typical users are interested in solving and adjoint problem for the sake of solving of an adjoint problem?. However OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION is not a good name, from the point of view of the continuous adjoint, I would feel comfortable if we change it to ADJ_BND_CONDITION. That probably doesn't work for the discrete adjoint, isn't it? Tim, What key word would work for the Discrete Adjoint? We need something that reflect the effect, in mathematical terms, of the objective function in the AD adjoint problem. Finally, before adding any capability we should ask ourself how general is going to be and if it going to be useful for the most part of the SU2 users community (in my opinion, external aerodynamics). If the new objective function is only useful for us, or a research project, then I think we need to create some kind of custom objective function, (e.g. CUSTOM_OBJFUNC at the same level than DRAG, LIFT, etc) that we can describe with other set of parameters.

We don't want the `_intIndexBased` routines for the FSI cases. They work by re-recording new tapes for each set of variables (fluid solution/coordinates/displacement solution) with added specific routines within the solvers/iterators for cross dependencies (which goes along with saving indices externally, but in a preassigned order). > What are the implications for when we extract the adjoints? Do we need an index-based GetDerivative?. Yes there are counterparts in `RegisterSolution`, `SetAdjoint_Output` and `ExtractAdjoint_Solution`. But nothing more.

Deployability,"Thank you @TobiKattmann for your feedback. The idea behind this new regression test config file is as follows:; We should have a test case that triggers the negative part of the SA model. Depending on the flow conditions, geometry and CFD parameters it might be triggered or not. With the previous config file, it was not. ; I think there is already a regression test in SU2 that triggers the negative SA, the `turb_oneram6_nk`. However, I decided to stick to rae2822 airfoil as it is a simpler (faster) case. In order to force the negative part of the SA for the rae2822 in a reasonable amount of iterations for a regression test, I increased the angle of attack. I have removed the multigrid as it might not be stable, but I have not tested though. Anyway, with the current configuration, e.g., convective scheme, CFL number, etc, the solution is not stable and diverges after some iterations, around 15. In that sense, I reduced the number of iterations from 20 to 10. In my opinion, a diverging regression test is not a problem at all as it might not be used as a tutorial, only to verify the integrity of the commit. ""The solution should always diverge to the same results"". If the regression test should converge, let me know and I will update the config file :)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1559#issuecomment-1067926363:776,configurat,configuration,776,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/1559#issuecomment-1067926363,4,"['configurat', 'update']","['configuration', 'update']"

Deployability,"Thank you for replying!. Yeah, apologies as I forgot to add that part in my CFD online post. I agree with the fact that there would be a certain difference in the values between the two solvers. But as not as large as what I am getting, as you said. After my initial post on CFD online, I meshed with finer settings and ran different meshes only to find the drop in y+ near that sharp region of the blade root-spinner junction. It went from 450 to 200 (latest). This could affect the solution significantly. I will run the simulation with NUM_METHOD_GRAD= WEIGHTED_LEAST_SQUARES as mentioned by you, as I had been running it with GREEN_GAUSS up until now because it turns out to be faster. . In Fluent, the thrust and torque values are in dimensional form and it reports the forces on propeller and spinner in the x-direction as my flow is in that direction. I am not sure why -CFz and -CMz for SU2? I know that the factor to get the dimensional force is calculated using surface normals in the z-direction, and the reference area is based on that.

Deployability,"Thanks @MicK7 I will have a look, my initial thought was to have a simple strategy where within each MPI rank parallelism is extracted via colouring or scatter-to-gather transformations and only one thread per rank participates in the message passing, I have no experience here though so this might be a bad strategy, idk. **Back to business:**; I went silent for a bit because in prototyping a typical residual computation and matrix update loop I made some realisations that made me go back to the drawing board regarding data structures, and eventually back to square 0. . ## Parallel strategy for flux computation; Because significant computation is required to obtain each edge's flux, it does not make sense to attempt a ""point-loop"" strategy (which would double the effort).; However, one can either use colouring to avoid the race conditions that would result from updating the residual of cells i and j, or store the edge fluxes and then, on a second point-loop perform the summation of fluxes for each cell, with the direction being accounted by the same adjacency information used in the point-loop GG gradient computation.; If we consider only the update of residuals the two strategies are fairly equivalent performance wise, the tie breaker is the matrix updates. ## Matrix Updates; By this I mean the `addBlock`, `subBlock` we do (two times each) to update diagonal and off-diagonal blocks for each edge.; Here is a dummy numerics loop that does nothing else but setting blocks in the matrix (with colouring).; ```c++; void testLoop1(const vector<size_t>& colorStart,; const vector<size_t>& edgeIdx,; const vector<pair<size_t,size_t> >& connectivity,; double** blk_i, double** blk_j,; SparseMatrix& matrix); {; matrix.setZero();. for(size_t color=0; color<colorStart.size()-1; ++color); #pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic,CHUNK_SIZE); for(size_t k=colorStart[color]; k<colorStart[color+1]; ++k); {; size_t iEdge = edgeIdx[k];; size_t iPoint = connectivity[iEdge].first;; size_t j",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-535977206:435,update,update,435,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/789#issuecomment-535977206,2,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"Thanks @clarkpede to take the initiative for this topic. I think unit-tests are a useful thing and we should think about having it in addition to the regression tests. Regarding the framework I am actually a little bit hesitant to use boost. Although we are already using it for tecio, in that case it is used in a part of the code which does not change frequently so it is fine if we are just shipping it. However, if we start introducing it into the actual development process people may want to use more and more features of boost and we will have a hard time maintaining versions, compatbilities and so on. And in my opinion we should keep it as simple and lightweight as possible (one of our biggest strengths is the simple compilation/installation, which actually attracts a lot of users). So in that regard Catch2 looks like a better candidat to me.

To everyone else, a quick update on the issue of performance vs. MKL.; I played a bit with @vdweide 's case and it does not seem trivial to get those 10% of performance back, at least not without a lot of restructuring.; I did however measure the performance of native gemm in Eigen to be ""only"" 2.5 times worse than MKL, after some emails we determined that this was because with the Intel compiler Eigen was not using AVX instructions but with g++ those instructions could be enabled by setting the -march flag appropriately. So far the conclusions are:; - Get 0% to 10% performance loss if you are using MKL (one could always bypass Eigen and call mkl directly).; - Write clean code compatible with AD and that will perform better than most easy implementations.; - Eventually get better performance of the discrete adjoint via the more efficient differentiation of operations with matrix-like objects.; - Have an extra dependency that does not need to be compiled.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/643#issuecomment-463591821:72,update,update,72,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/643#issuecomment-463591821,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"Thanks for all the questions on the shape optimization. It helps us make improvements to the code to make it easier to use. . You are correct in that the adjoint gradients determine the direction that the optimizer moves the design variables. But this direction can (and usually does) change during the optimization process as it explores different parts of the design space. So the design variables won't always move in the same direction. Sometimes the optimizer won't take the best step in the direction of descent. In this case, the objective function can increase. The optimizer will then try again in the same direction but with a different (usually smaller) step size. If it does achieve a reduction in the objective function, it will usually run the adjoints again to get an updated gradient direction. The objective + adjoint iterations are called major iterations and are what is output by the SLSQP algorithm. This process is more complicated when there are constraints involved. . So in summary, no it is not necessary (or likely) that the objective function will always decrease through an optimization process",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/984#issuecomment-628714360:783,update,updated,783,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/984#issuecomment-628714360,1,['update'],['updated']
Deployability,"Thanks for finding a way to speed things up.; With regards to the tolerance, it would be preferable to update the test values rather than the tolerance, since especially for changes in the integrated values rather than the residual values, small changes over the small number of iterations could indicate a problem that will grow over time. A very small number of iterations is used in the tests in order to save time for the tests. . Are the changes you quote for the original precision, or for the quad-precision? If the latter, and maybe either way, I would recommend running the case for a larger number of iterations to make sure that there aren't larger differences growing over time that would effect the output, maybe due to some other change in the code that hasn't been identified yet.

Deployability,"Thanks for the clarification clarkpede. One of the things I had tried when I first ran into that warning after looking at the code was to create a coarse grid with fewer than 1000 elements (just in case the sensor value was extremely large for a single element for some reason, then it should’ve at least marked that one for adaptation). However, it still output the same results and warning message.

Deployability,"Thanks for the question; The RESTART_SOLUTION option determines only whether the CFD solution will restart from a provided solution file, not whether the optimizer will restart. ; To restart the optimizer process, this must be specified to the python script:; shape_optimization.py -r project.pkl -f config.cfg -n N; The options of all the python scripts can be viewed with a command like:; shape_optimization.py -h. So, to run an optimization process restarted from a previous optimization, and to have each individual simulation restart from previously converged CFD results you will need to BOTH specify RESTART_SOLUTION and the -r python option. To restart the optimizer but have each CFD simulation start from scratch, use the -r option and specify RESTART_SOLUTION=NO. . Restarting from a specified design (rather than the most recent design) is not currently provided as an option, but if you are willing to dig into things manually it may be possible via editing the project.pkl and results.pkl files. .

Deployability,"Thanks for the quick review @pcarruscag. I have cleaned up a little bit. Also added a nicer table of the output. l prefer that we always compute the min/max values, at least for the FVM CFD solvers, for a few reasons. The most important reason is that we should start to build up some intuition about the correlation between mesh quality metrics and accuracy + convergence in the solvers. This can be especially important during optimization when the mesh is deforming. I think the metrics are valuable to print every time for this reason, which might help users diagnose problems eventually. Additionally, the cost is relatively small (on par with the other pre-processing routines, it is only executed once and it is parallelized, and the memory is released if we don't write).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/778#issuecomment-526456264:751,release,released,751,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/778#issuecomment-526456264,2,['release'],['released']

The way I was thinking about it is that OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION would now serve the same purpose and have the same behavior across multiple methods - right now (in the current develop and master branch), OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION is used either when running SU2_CFD with the continuous or discrete adjoint method, and when running continuous_adjoint.py, while OPT_OBJECTIVE is used with shape_optimization.py.; Where this gets confusing is that shape_optimization.py automatically flips signs of certain objectives without ever informing the user that this is the case - right now the only way to find out that the sign is flipped is either to carefully read through the source code or run a case and figure it out from the results. ; This will get more confusing when adding in multiple objectives - I would like to at least move the sign change into the config file rather than hidden behind the scenes; however that does get dangerous as it will quietly change the optimization behavior for people who aren't aware of that modification.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/241#issuecomment-185479306:319,continuous,continuous,319,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/241#issuecomment-185479306,1,['continuous'],['continuous']

Deployability,"Thanks, Tim. Adding flexibility to the FFD is a great contribution. I was just going through the changes and I have a couple of questions:; 1. I noticed that you have added AD as an option for computing the geometric sensitivity component (change in the surface location due to a delta change in the design variable) that multiplies the adjoint sensitivity. Is there a way to make this usable for the continuous adjoint too rather than using finite differencing? This assumes that the user has built the AD version, even though they use the continuous adjoint.; 2. On a related note (I think), is the finite differencing that is currently used for computing the geometric sensitivity the only roadblock to arbitrary FFD movements for the continuous adjoint?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/239#issuecomment-183462794:401,continuous,continuous,401,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/pull/239#issuecomment-183462794,6,['continuous'],['continuous']

If you are building OpenBLAS from source there is an option to provide LAPACK support (if I recall correctly, this is the default so I'm guessing you are using what the operating system provides).; The best solution is to get OpenBLAS with LAPACK support, alternatively:; - Install LAPACK for your operating system and below line 155 of meson.build add ```su2_deps += dependency('lapack')``` (this will use pkg config).; - Delete line 153 of meson.build, i.e. keep BLAS but disable LAPACK, this can either make what you are doing much slower, or have no difference at all...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,su2code,SU2,v8.1.0,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1000#issuecomment-721373702:531,Install,Install,531,https://su2code.github.io,https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues/1000#issuecomment-721373702,1,['Install'],['Install']

Deployability,"That's not consistent with any code I know, when using the MRF approach you either get frozen rotor or mixing plane interfaces. If you want a more accurate simulation you move the mesh and update the interfaces, there are several advantages to not dealing with the MRF source terms. There are also practical aspects of not updating the interface when doing transient MRF, for example it lets you handle interfaces that are not cylindrical, people use this to model car wheels.; MRF is also less restrictive for time step size than moving mesh, but if you move the interface you bring some of the moving mesh restrictions to MRF.

Deployability,"The discrete adjoint may still run with the chosen objective, since that is entirely defined within the C++, but some additional steps may be needed to run your objective with the Python framework. First, I recommend that you verify in your primal solve that you can compute one of your chosen objectives such as ENTROPY_GENERATION, and that it appears in the history file, since this is a prerequisite for running shape optimization with the Python framework. You should be able to follow details of the old ENTROPY_GENERATION objective if you look in the COutputLegacy::SpecialOutput_Turbo() routine in the legacy output. Note that you may need to do some work to connect this for your particular problem, since as mentioned, the turbomachinery related features are currently being brought into line with the most recent version of the software, and the routine may not be called by default. Once you have your desired objectives being computed and printed to the history file, give the updateHistoryMap.py script a look so that you can update the fields that the python framework can handle. As for custom objectives, there is a variable within the fluid solvers named Total_Custom_ObjFunc that will be differentiated for you if you use it compute a custom expression within the solver class (you can do this in multiple places within the solver class, but make sure it is called).
