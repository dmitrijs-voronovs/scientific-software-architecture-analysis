Their treatment; of error cases is very different however: Where ExitOnError is guaranteed to; terminate the program on an error input, cantFail simply asserts that the result; is success. In debug builds this will result in an assertion failure if an error; is encountered. In release builds the behavior of cantFail for failure values is; undefined. As such, care must be taken in the use of cantFail: clients must be; certain that a cantFail wrapped call really can not fail with the given; arguments. Use of the cantFail functions should be rare in library code, but they are; likely to be of more use in tool and unit-test code where inputs and/or; mocked-up classes or functions may be known to be safe. Fallible constructors; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Some classes require resource acquisition or other complex initialization that; can fail during construction. Unfortunately constructors can't return errors,; and having clients test objects after they're constructed to ensure that they're; valid is error prone as it's all too easy to forget the test. To work around; this, use the named constructor idiom and return an ``Expected<T>``:. .. code-block:: c++. class Foo {; public:. static Expected<Foo> Create(Resource R1, Resource R2) {; Error Err = Error::success();; Foo F(R1, R2, Err);; if (Err); return std::move(Err);; return std::move(F);; }. private:. Foo(Resource R1, Resource R2, Error &Err) {; ErrorAsOutParameter EAO(&Err);; if (auto Err2 = R1.acquire()) {; Err = std::move(Err2);; return;; }; Err = R2.acquire();; }; };. Here, the named constructor passes an ``Error`` by reference into the actual; constructor, which the constructor can then use to return errors. The; ``ErrorAsOutParameter`` utility sets the ``Error`` value's checked flag on entry; to the constructor so that the error can be assigned to, then resets it on exit; to force the client (the named constructor) to check the error.

Testability,"ive rotation, i.e. a rotation of objects; inside a static system of coordinates. In case you want to rotate the; frame and want to know the coordinates of objects in the rotated system,; you should apply the inverse rotation to the objects. If you want to; transform coordinates from the rotated frame to the original frame you; have to apply the direct transformation. A rotation around a specified; axis means counterclockwise rotation around the positive direction of; the axis. ### Declaration, Access, Comparisons. ``` {.cpp}; TRotation r; // r initialized as identity; TRotation m(r); // m = r; ```. There is no direct way to set the matrix elements - to ensure that a; **`TRotation`** always describes a real rotation. But you can get the; values by with the methods `XX()..ZZ()` or the `(,)` operator:. ``` {.cpp}; Double_t xx = r.XX(); // the same as xx=r(0,0); xx = r(0,0);; if (r==m) {...} // test for equality; if (r!=m) {..} // test for inequality; if (r.IsIdentity()) {...} // test for identity; ```. ### Rotation around Axes. The following matrices describe counter-clockwise rotations around the; coordinate axes and are implemented in: `RotateX()`,` RotateY()` and; `RotateZ()`:. $$; Rx(a) = \left|; \begin{array}{ccc}; 1 & 0 & 0 \\; 0 & cos(a) & -sin(a) \\; 0 & sin(a) & cos(a); \end{array}; \right|; Ry(a) = \left|; \begin{array}{ccc}; cos(a) & 0 & sin(a) \\; 0 & 1 & 0 \\; -sin(a) & 0 & cos(a); \end{array}; \right|; Rz(a) = \left|; \begin{array}{ccc}; cos(a) & -sin(a) & 0 \\; sin(a) & cos(a) & 0 \\; 0 & 0 & 1; \end{array}; \right|; $$. ``` {.cpp}; r.RotateX(TMath::Pi()); // rotation around the x-axis; ```. ### Rotation around Arbitrary Axis. The `Rotate()` method allows you to rotate around an arbitrary vector; (not necessary a unit one) and returns the result. ``` {.cpp}; r.Rotate(TMath::Pi()/3,TVector3(3,4,5));; ```.

It would be very unfortunate if we end up with worse performance after using modules.; The main concern is that when we compile a source file, the compiler needs to see the function body; of imported module units so that it can perform IPO (InterProcedural Optimization, primarily inlining; in practice) to optimize functions in current source file with the help of the information provided by; the imported module units.; In other words, the imported code would be processed again and again in importee units; by optimizations (including IPO itself).; The optimizations before IPO and the IPO itself are the most time-consuming part in whole compilation process.; So from this perspective, we might not be able to get the improvements described in the theory.; But we could still save the time for optimizations after IPO and the whole backend. Overall, at ``O0`` the implementations of functions defined in a module will not impact module users,; but at higher optimization levels the definitions of such functions are provided to user compilations for the; purposes of optimization (but definitions of these functions are still not included in the use's object file)-; this means the build speedup at higher optimization levels may be lower than expected given ``O0`` experience,; but does provide by more optimization opportunities.

Custom Assertion Handlers. The analyzer exploits code assertions by pruning off paths where the; assertion condition is false. The idea is capture any program invariants; specified in the assertion that the developer may know but is not immediately; apparent in the code itself. In this way assertions make implicit assumptions; explicit in the code, which not only makes the analyzer more accurate when; finding bugs, but can help others better able to understand your code as well.; It can also help remove certain kinds of analyzer false positives by pruning off; false paths.; In order to exploit assertions, however, the analyzer must understand when it; encounters an ""assertion handler."" Typically assertions are; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler. For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program.

On x86, this data is stored in the flags register used by the; conditional jump instruction. Along both edges after this fork in control flow,; the flags register remains alive and contains data that we can use to build up; our accumulated predicate state. We accumulate it using the x86 conditional; move instruction which also reads the flag registers where the state resides.; These conditional move instructions are known to not be predicted on any x86; processors, making them immune to misprediction that could reintroduce the; vulnerability. When we insert the conditional moves, the code ends up looking; like the following:; ```; # %bb.0: # %entry; pushq %rax; xorl %eax, %eax # Zero out initial predicate state.; movq $-1, %r8 # Put all-ones mask into a register.; testl %edi, %edi; jne .LBB0_1; # %bb.2: # %then1; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; testl %esi, %esi; jne .LBB0_1; # %bb.3: # %then2; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; testl %edx, %edx; je .LBB0_4; .LBB0_1:; cmoveq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; popq %rax; retq; .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; ```. Here we create the ""empty"" or ""correct execution"" predicate state by zeroing; `%rax`, and we create a constant ""incorrect execution"" predicate value by; putting `-1` into `%r8`. Then, along each edge coming out of a conditional; branch we do a conditional move that in a correct execution will be a no-op,; but if misspeculated, will replace the `%rax` with the value of `%r8`.; Misspeculating any one of the three predicates will cause `%rax` to hold the; ""incorrect execution"" value from `%r8` as we preserve incoming values when; execution is correct rather than overwriting it.

ThreadSanitizer supports ``src`` and ``fun`` entity types in; :doc:`SanitizerSpecialCaseList`, that can be used to suppress data race reports; in the specified source files or functions. Unlike functions marked with; ``no_sanitize(""thread"")`` attribute, ignored functions are not instrumented; at all. This can lead to false positives due to missed synchronization via; atomic operations and missed stack frames in reports. Limitations; -----------. * ThreadSanitizer uses more real memory than a native run. At the default; settings the memory overhead is 5x plus 1Mb per each thread. Settings with 3x; (less accurate analysis) and 9x (more accurate analysis) overhead are also; available.; * ThreadSanitizer maps (but does not reserve) a lot of virtual address space.; This means that tools like ``ulimit`` may not work as usually expected.; * Libc/libstdc++ static linking is not supported.; * Non-position-independent executables are not supported. Therefore, the; ``fsanitize=thread`` flag will cause Clang to act as though the ``-fPIE``; flag had been supplied if compiling without ``-fPIC``, and as though the; ``-pie`` flag had been supplied if linking an executable. Current Status; --------------. ThreadSanitizer is in beta stage. It is known to work on large C++ programs; using pthreads, but we do not promise anything (yet).

To run individual tests or subsets of tests, you can use the ``llvm-lit``; script which is built as part of LLVM. For example, to run the; ``Integer/BitPacked.ll`` test by itself you can run:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm-lit ~/llvm/test/Integer/BitPacked.ll. or to run all of the ARM CodeGen tests:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm-lit ~/llvm/test/CodeGen/ARM. The regression tests will use the Python psutil module only if installed in a; **non-user** location. Under Linux, install with sudo or within a virtual; environment. Under Windows, install Python for all users and then run; ``pip install psutil`` in an elevated command prompt. For more information on using the :program:`lit` tool, see ``llvm-lit --help``; or the :doc:`lit man page <CommandGuide/lit>`. Debugging Information tests; ---------------------------. To run debugging information tests simply add the ``cross-project-tests``; project to your ``LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`` define on the cmake; command-line.

Writing new regression tests; ----------------------------. The regression test structure is very simple, but does require some; information to be set. This information is gathered via ``cmake``; and is written to a file, ``test/lit.site.cfg.py`` in the build directory.; The ``llvm/test`` Makefile does this work for you.

Compile with ``-g`` and ``-fno-omit-frame-pointer`` to get proper debug; information in your binary.; #. Run your program with environment variable; ``UBSAN_OPTIONS=print_stacktrace=1``.; #. Make sure ``llvm-symbolizer`` binary is in ``PATH``. Logging; =======. The default log file for diagnostics is ""stderr"". To log diagnostics to another; file, you can set ``UBSAN_OPTIONS=log_path=...``. Silencing Unsigned Integer Overflow; ===================================; To silence reports from unsigned integer overflow, you can set; ``UBSAN_OPTIONS=silence_unsigned_overflow=1``. This feature, combined with; ``-fsanitize-recover=unsigned-integer-overflow``, is particularly useful for; providing fuzzing signal without blowing up logs. Issue Suppression; =================. UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer is not expected to produce false positives.; If you see one, look again; most likely it is a true positive!.

Testability,"l Suites; ---------------. External suites such as SPEC can be enabled by either. - placing (or linking) them into the `test-suite/test-suite-externals/xxx` directory (example: `test-suite/test-suite-externals/speccpu2000`); - using a configuration option such as `-D TEST_SUITE_SPEC2000_ROOT=path/to/speccpu2000`. You can find further information in the respective README files such as; `test-suite/External/SPEC/README`. For the SPEC benchmarks you can switch between the `test`, `train` and; `ref` input datasets via the `TEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE` configuration option.; The `train` dataset is used by default. Custom Suites; -------------. You can build custom suites using the test-suite infrastructure. A custom suite; has a `CMakeLists.txt` file at the top directory. The `CMakeLists.txt` will be; picked up automatically if placed into a subdirectory of the test-suite or when; setting the `TEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS` variable:. ```bash; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS=path/to/my/benchmark-suite ../test-suite; ```. Profile Guided Optimization; ---------------------------. Profile guided optimization requires to compile and run twice. First the; benchmark should be compiled with profile generation instrumentation enabled; and setup for training data. The lit runner will merge the profile files; using `llvm-profdata` so they can be used by the second compilation run. Example:; ```bash; # Profile generation run using LLVM IR PGO:; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_GENERATE=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_USE_IR_PGO=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE=train \; ../test-suite; % make; % llvm-lit .; # Use the profile data for compilation and actual benchmark run:; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_GENERATE=OFF \; -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_USE=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE=ref \; .; % make; % llvm-lit -o result.json .; ```. To use Clang frontend's PGO instead of LLVM IR PGO, set `-DTEST_SUITE_USE_IR_PGO=OFF`. The `TEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE` setting only affects the SPEC benchmark suites.

Generating LLVM code for expression nodes is very straightforward: less; than 45 lines of commented code for all four of our expression nodes.; First we'll do numeric literals:. .. code-block:: c++. Value *NumberExprAST::codegen() {; return ConstantFP::get(*TheContext, APFloat(Val));; }. In the LLVM IR, numeric constants are represented with the; ``ConstantFP`` class, which holds the numeric value in an ``APFloat``; internally (``APFloat`` has the capability of holding floating point; constants of Arbitrary Precision). This code basically just creates; and returns a ``ConstantFP``. Note that in the LLVM IR that constants; are all uniqued together and shared. For this reason, the API uses the; ""foo::get(...)"" idiom instead of ""new foo(..)"" or ""foo::Create(..)"". .. code-block:: c++. Value *VariableExprAST::codegen() {; // Look this variable up in the function.; Value *V = NamedValues[Name];; if (!V); LogErrorV(""Unknown variable name"");; return V;; }. References to variables are also quite simple using LLVM. In the simple; version of Kaleidoscope, we assume that the variable has already been; emitted somewhere and its value is available. In practice, the only; values that can be in the ``NamedValues`` map are function arguments.; This code simply checks to see that the specified name is in the map (if; not, an unknown variable is being referenced) and returns the value for; it.

The compiler and runtime provide :block-term:`copy` and; :block-term:`release` operations for Block references that create and,; in matched use, release allocated storage for referenced Blocks. The copy operation ``Block_copy()`` is styled as a function that takes; an arbitrary Block reference and returns a Block reference of the same; type. The release operation, ``Block_release()``, is styled as a; function that takes an arbitrary Block reference and, if dynamically; matched to a Block copy operation, allows recovery of the referenced; allocated memory. The ``__block`` Storage Qualifier; =================================. In addition to the new Block type we also introduce a new storage; qualifier, :block-term:`__block`, for local variables. [testme: a; __block declaration within a block literal] The ``__block`` storage; qualifier is mutually exclusive to the existing local storage; qualifiers auto, register, and static. [testme] Variables qualified by; ``__block`` act as if they were in allocated storage and this storage; is automatically recovered after last use of said variable. An; implementation may choose an optimization where the storage is; initially automatic and only ""moved"" to allocated (heap) storage upon; a Block_copy of a referencing Block. Such variables may be mutated as; normal variables are. In the case where a ``__block`` variable is a Block one must assume; that the ``__block`` variable resides in allocated storage and as such; is assumed to reference a Block that is also in allocated storage; (that it is the result of a ``Block_copy`` operation).

Design Philosophy; =================. ``bugpoint`` is designed to be a useful tool without requiring any hooks into; the LLVM infrastructure at all. It works with any and all LLVM passes and code; generators, and does not need to ""know"" how they work.

Note; that ``bugpoint`` is generally very quick unless debugging a miscompilation; where each test of the program (which requires executing it) takes a long time. Automatic Debugger Selection; ----------------------------. ``bugpoint`` reads each ``.bc`` or ``.ll`` file specified on the command line; and links them together into a single module, called the test program.

We; have shown how to retrieve the data arrays from the branches of the tree; in the previous section, and you could just write that program from; scratch. Since this is a very common task, ROOT provides a utility that; generates a skeleton class designed to loop over the entries of the; tree. This is the `TTree::MakeClass` method. We will now go through the steps; of using `MakeClass` with a simplified example. The methods used here; obviously work for complex event loop calculations. These are our assumptions: we would like to do selective plotting and; loop through each entry of the tree and tracks. We chose a simple; example: we want to plot `fPx` of the first 100 tracks of each entry. We; have a ROOT tree with a branch for each data member in the ""`Event`""; object.

In this case, the classes are; Event, `EventHeader`, and Track and they are defined in the shared; library `libEvent.so`. The designer also gives you the `Event.h` file to; see the definition of the classes.

""More Canonical"" Loops; ======================. .. _loop-terminology-loop-rotate:. Rotated Loops; -------------. Loops are rotated by the LoopRotate (:ref:`loop-rotate <passes-loop-rotate>`); pass, which converts loops into do/while style loops and is; implemented in; `LoopRotation.h <https://llvm.org/doxygen/LoopRotation_8h_source.html>`_. Example:. .. code-block:: C. void test(int n) {; for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 1); // Loop body; }. is transformed to:. .. code-block:: C. void test(int n) {; int i = 0;; do {; // Loop body; i += 1;; } while (i < n);; }. **Warning**: This transformation is valid only if the compiler; can prove that the loop body will be executed at least once. Otherwise,; it has to insert a guard which will test it at runtime. In the example; above, that would be:. .. code-block:: C. void test(int n) {; int i = 0;; if (n > 0) {; do {; // Loop body; i += 1;; } while (i < n);; }; }. It's important to understand the effect of loop rotation; at the LLVM IR level. We follow with the previous examples; in LLVM IR while also providing a graphical representation; of the control-flow graphs (CFG). You can get the same graphical; results by utilizing the :ref:`view-cfg <passes-view-cfg>` pass. The initial **for** loop could be translated to:. .. code-block:: none. define void @test(i32 %n) {; entry:; br label %for.header. for.header:; %i = phi i32 [ 0, %entry ], [ %i.next, %latch ]; %cond = icmp slt i32 %i, %n; br i1 %cond, label %body, label %exit. body:; ; Loop body; br label %latch. latch:; %i.next = add nsw i32 %i, 1; br label %for.header. exit:; ret void; }. .. image:: ./loop-terminology-initial-loop.png; :width: 400 px.

When parsing an; Expression Statement, if the last semicolon is missing, then the code will; pretend that there one and set a marker there for later utilization, and; continue parsing. A semicolon is normally required in C++, but this feature expands the C++; syntax to handle cases where a missing semicolon is expected (i.e., when; handling an expression statement). It also makes sure that an error is not; generated for the missing semicolon in this specific case. This is accomplished by identifying the end position of the user input; (expression statement). This helps store and return the expression statement; effectively, so that it can be printed (displayed to the user automatically). **Note:** This logic is only available for C++ for now, since part of the; implementation itself requires C++ features. Future versions may support more; languages. .. code-block:: console. Token *CurTok = nullptr;; // If the semicolon is missing at the end of REPL input, consider if; // we want to do value printing.

Testability,"lang - Features and Goals. Clang - Features and Goals. This page describes the features and goals of; Clang in more detail and gives a more broad explanation about what we mean.; These features are:. End-User Features:. Fast compiles and low memory use; Expressive diagnostics; GCC compatibility. Utility and Applications:. Library based architecture; Support diverse clients; Integration with IDEs; Use the LLVM 'BSD' License. Internal Design and Implementation:. A real-world, production quality compiler; A simple and hackable code base; A single unified parser for C, Objective C, C++,; and Objective C++; Conformance with C/C++/ObjC and their; variants. End-User Features. Fast compiles and Low Memory Use. A major focus of our work on clang is to make it fast, light and scalable.; The library-based architecture of clang makes it straight-forward to time and; profile the cost of each layer of the stack, and the driver has a number of; options for performance analysis. Many detailed benchmarks can be found online.; Compile time performance is important, but when using clang as an API, often; memory use is even more so: the less memory the code takes the more code you can; fit into memory at a time (useful for whole program analysis tools, for; example).; In addition to being efficient when pitted head-to-head against GCC in batch; mode, clang is built with a library based; architecture that makes it relatively easy to adapt it and build new tools; with it. This means that it is often possible to apply out-of-the-box thinking; and novel techniques to improve compilation in various ways. Expressive Diagnostics. In addition to being fast and functional, we aim to make Clang extremely user; friendly. As far as a command-line compiler goes, this basically boils down to; making the diagnostics (error and warning messages) generated by the compiler; be as useful as possible. There are several ways that we do this, but the; most important are pinpointing exactly what is wrong in ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html:995,benchmark,benchmarks,995,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/features.html,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarks']

If the error condition can be triggered by user input then the; recoverable error mechanism described in :doc:`ProgrammersManual` should be; used instead. In cases where this is not practical, ``report_fatal_error`` may; be used. Another issue is that values used only by assertions will produce an ""unused; value"" warning when assertions are disabled. For example, this code will warn:. .. code-block:: c++. unsigned Size = V.size();; assert(Size > 42 && ""Vector smaller than it should be"");. bool NewToSet = Myset.insert(Value);; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");. These are two interesting different cases. In the first case, the call to; ``V.size()`` is only useful for the assert, and we don't want it executed when; assertions are disabled. Code like this should move the call into the assert; itself. In the second case, the side effects of the call must happen whether; the assert is enabled or not. In this case, the value should be cast to void to; disable the warning. To be specific, it is preferred to write the code like; this:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(V.size() > 42 && ""Vector smaller than it should be"");. bool NewToSet = Myset.insert(Value); (void)NewToSet;; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");.

Testability,"lasses) are an important part of the AST.; Types are accessed through the ``ASTContext`` class, which implicitly creates; and uniques them as they are needed. Types have a couple of non-obvious; features: 1) they do not capture type qualifiers like ``const`` or ``volatile``; (see :ref:`QualType <QualType>`), and 2) they implicitly capture typedef; information. Once created, types are immutable (unlike decls). Typedefs in C make semantic analysis a bit more complex than it would be without; them. The issue is that we want to capture typedef information and represent it; in the AST perfectly, but the semantics of operations need to ""see through""; typedefs. For example, consider this code:. .. code-block:: c++. void func() {; typedef int foo;; foo X, *Y;; typedef foo *bar;; bar Z;; *X; // error; **Y; // error; **Z; // error; }. The code above is illegal, and thus we expect there to be diagnostics emitted; on the annotated lines. In this example, we expect to get:. .. code-block:: text. test.c:6:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); *X; // error; ^~; test.c:7:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); **Y; // error; ^~~; test.c:8:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); **Z; // error; ^~~. While this example is somewhat silly, it illustrates the point: we want to; retain typedef information where possible, so that we can emit errors about; ""``std::string``"" instead of ""``std::basic_string<char, std:...``"". Doing this; requires properly keeping typedef information (for example, the type of ``X``; is ""``foo``"", not ""``int``""), and requires properly propagating it through the; various operators (for example, the type of ``*Y`` is ""``foo``"", not; ""``int``""). In order to retain this information, the type of these expressions; is an instance of the ``TypedefType`` class, which indicates that the type of; these expressions is a typedef for ""``foo``"".

The bit exists still in ROOT 6.0 but it has no effect.; One should use now the new function `TH1::SetCanExtend(..)` passing the axis (using the appropriate enumeration), which needs to be extended.; In addition to extend each axis individually, the function can be used also to enable/disable extension for all axes.; For example `TH1::SetCanExtend(TH1::kXaxis)` will make extendable only the X axis; `TH1::SetCanExtend(TH1::kAllAxes)` will; make extendable all the axes (this is the same functionality of the previous function `SetBit(TH1::kCanRebin)` and; `TH1::SetCanExtend(TH1::kNoAxis)` will remove the extendable functionality to all the axes (equivalent to the old `ResetBit(TH1::kCanRebin)`).; The functionality of `TestBit(TH1::kCanRebin)` is now replaced by `TH1::CanExtendAllAxis()`. - An histogram filled with weights different than one has now automatically the sum of the weight squared stored inside, without the need to call anymore; `TH1::Sumw2()`. As a consequences an histogram filled with weights will always draw the errors by default. If one desire to continue having the histogram drawn; without the errors, one should use the `hist` option: `h.Draw(""hist"")`.; If, for memory reason, one does not want to remove the internal array storing the bin errors (the bin sum of weight square), one can use the function `TH1::Sumw2(false)`. - The copy constructor is not anymore public for TH1.

Since we 'know' that this is a 'neg', we can actually ""fold"" the spill into; the neg/abs instruction, turning it into an *integer* operation, like this:. 	xorl 2147483648, [mem+4] ## 2147483648 = (1 << 31). you could also use xorb, but xorl is less likely to lead to a partial register; stall.

The whole programs tests are referred to as the ""LLVM test suite"" (or; ""test-suite"") and are in the ``test-suite``; `repository on GitHub <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git>`_.; For historical reasons, these tests are also referred to as the ""nightly; tests"" in places, which is less ambiguous than ""test-suite"" and remains; in use although we run them much more often than nightly. Unit tests; ----------. Unit tests are written using `Google Test <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/primer.md>`_; and `Google Mock <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/gmock_for_dummies.md>`_; and are located in the ``llvm/unittests`` directory.; In general unit tests are reserved for targeting the support library and other; generic data structure, we prefer relying on regression tests for testing; transformations and analysis on the IR. Regression tests; ----------------. The regression tests are small pieces of code that test a specific; feature of LLVM or trigger a specific bug in LLVM. The language they are; written in depends on the part of LLVM being tested. These tests are driven by; the :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool (which is part of LLVM), and; are located in the ``llvm/test`` directory. Typically when a bug is found in LLVM, a regression test containing just; enough code to reproduce the problem should be written and placed; somewhere underneath this directory. For example, it can be a small; piece of LLVM IR distilled from an actual application or benchmark. Testing Analysis; ----------------. An analysis is a pass that infer properties on some part of the IR and not; transforming it. They are tested in general using the same infrastructure as the; regression tests, by creating a separate ""Printer"" pass to consume the analysis; result and print it on the standard output in a textual format suitable for; FileCheck.; See `llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll <https://github.com/",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:1955,test,tests,1955,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Each; editable geometry class **`TGeoXXX`** have a correspondent editor; **`TGeoXXXEditor`** that provides a graphics user interface allowing to; edit some (or all) parameters of a geometry object. The editable objects; are geometry manager, volumes, nodes, shapes, media, materials and; matrices. The interfaces provide also access to specific functionality; of geometry objects. The editing mechanism is based on ROOT GED; (Graphics Editors) functionality and the library is loaded using the; plug-in mechanism. ### Editing a Geometry. There are two different use cases having different ways of invoking the; geometry editors. The first one applies when starting with geometry from; scratch and using the builder functionality to create new geometry; objects. In this case, one should use the sequence:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TGeoManager *geom = new TGeoManager(""MyGeom"",; ""Test builder"");; root[] geom->Edit(Option_t *option="""");; ```. The lines above will create a new **`TGeoManager`** class, create an; empty canvas and start the editor in the left-sided editor frame; attached to the canvas.

Testability,"le -- ``git bisect; run`` doesn't check for that, it just assumes the run script failed each time. Once your run script works, run ``git bisect run ./run.sh`` and a few hours; later you'll know which commit caused the regression. (This is a very simple run script. Often, you want to use just-built clang; to build a different project and then run a built executable of that project; in the run script.). Bisecting across multiple roots; ===============================. Here's how LLVM's history currently looks:. .. code-block:: none. A-o-o-......-o-D-o-o-HEAD; /; B-o-...-o-C-. ``A`` is the first commit in LLVM ever, ``97724f18c79c``. ``B`` is the first commit in MLIR, ``aed0d21a62db``. ``D`` is the merge commit that merged MLIR into the main LLVM repository,; ``0f0d0ed1c78f``. ``C`` is the last commit in MLIR before it got merged, ``0f0d0ed1c78f^2``. (The; ``^n`` modifier selects the n'th parent of a merge commit.). ``git bisect`` goes through all parent revisions. Due to the way MLIR was; merged, at every revision at ``C`` or earlier, *only* the ``mlir/`` directory; exists, and nothing else does. As of early 2020, there is no flag to ``git bisect`` to tell it to not; descend into all reachable commits. Ideally, we'd want to tell it to only; follow the first parent of ``D``. The best workaround is to pass a list of directories to ``git bisect``:; If you know the bug is due to a change in llvm, clang, or compiler-rt, use. .. code-block:: bash. git bisect start -- clang llvm compiler-rt. That way, the commits in ``mlir`` are never evaluated. Alternatively, ``git bisect skip aed0d21a6 aed0d21a6..0f0d0ed1c78f`` explicitly; skips all commits on that branch. It takes 1.5 minutes to run on a fast; machine, and makes ``git bisect log`` output unreadable. (``aed0d21a6`` is; listed twice because git ranges exclude the revision listed on the left,; so it needs to be ignored explicitly.).

Testability,"le a bug with the instructions and reduced .bc file; that llvm-reduce emits. .. _miscompiling:. Miscompilations; ===============. If clang successfully produces an executable, but that executable doesn't run; right, this is either a bug in the code or a bug in the compiler. The first; thing to check is to make sure it is not using undefined behavior (e.g.; reading a variable before it is defined). In particular, check to see if the; program is clean under various `sanitizers; <https://github.com/google/sanitizers>`_ (e.g. ``clang; -fsanitize=undefined,address``) and `valgrind <http://valgrind.org/>`_. Many; ""LLVM bugs"" that we have chased down ended up being bugs in the program being; compiled, not LLVM. Once you determine that the program itself is not buggy, you should choose; which code generator you wish to compile the program with (e.g. LLC or the JIT); and optionally a series of LLVM passes to run. For example:. .. code-block:: bash. bugpoint -run-llc [... optzn passes ...] file-to-test.bc --args -- [program arguments]. bugpoint will try to narrow down your list of passes to the one pass that; causes an error, and simplify the bitcode file as much as it can to assist; you. It will print a message letting you know how to reproduce the; resulting error. The :doc:`OptBisect <OptBisect>` page shows an alternative method for finding; incorrect optimization passes. Incorrect code generation; =========================. Similarly to debugging incorrect compilation by mis-behaving passes, you; can debug incorrect code generation by either LLC or the JIT, using; ``bugpoint``. The process ``bugpoint`` follows in this case is to try to; narrow the code down to a function that is miscompiled by one or the other; method, but since for correctness, the entire program must be run,; ``bugpoint`` will compile the code it deems to not be affected with the C; Backend, and then link in the shared object it generates.

LNT is a set of client and server tools for continuously monitoring; performance. You can find more information at; [https://llvm.org/docs/lnt](https://llvm.org/docs/lnt). The official LNT instance; of the LLVM project is hosted at [http://lnt.llvm.org](http://lnt.llvm.org). External Suites; ---------------. External suites such as SPEC can be enabled by either. - placing (or linking) them into the `test-suite/test-suite-externals/xxx` directory (example: `test-suite/test-suite-externals/speccpu2000`); - using a configuration option such as `-D TEST_SUITE_SPEC2000_ROOT=path/to/speccpu2000`. You can find further information in the respective README files such as; `test-suite/External/SPEC/README`. For the SPEC benchmarks you can switch between the `test`, `train` and; `ref` input datasets via the `TEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE` configuration option.; The `train` dataset is used by default. Custom Suites; -------------. You can build custom suites using the test-suite infrastructure. A custom suite; has a `CMakeLists.txt` file at the top directory. The `CMakeLists.txt` will be; picked up automatically if placed into a subdirectory of the test-suite or when; setting the `TEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS` variable:. ```bash; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS=path/to/my/benchmark-suite ../test-suite; ```. Profile Guided Optimization; ---------------------------. Profile guided optimization requires to compile and run twice. First the; benchmark should be compiled with profile generation instrumentation enabled; and setup for training data. The lit runner will merge the profile files; using `llvm-profdata` so they can be used by the second compilation run. Example:; ```bash; # Profile generation run using LLVM IR PGO:; % cmake -DTEST_SUITE_PROFILE_GENERATE=ON \; -DTEST_SUITE_USE_IR_",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteGuide.md:9358,benchmark,benchmarks,9358,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteGuide.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteGuide.md,2,"['benchmark', 'test']","['benchmarks', 'test']"

To run all of the LLVM unit tests use the check-llvm-unit target:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-llvm-unit. To run all of the LLVM regression tests use the check-llvm target:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-llvm. In order to get reasonable testing performance, build LLVM and subprojects; in release mode, i.e. .. code-block:: bash. % cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=""Release"" -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=On. If you have `Clang <https://clang.llvm.org/>`_ checked out and built, you; can run the LLVM and Clang tests simultaneously using:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-all. To run the tests with Valgrind (Memcheck by default), use the ``LIT_ARGS`` make; variable to pass the required options to lit. For example, you can use:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check LIT_ARGS=""-v --vg --vg-leak"". to enable testing with valgrind and with leak checking enabled. To run individual tests or subsets of tests, you can use the ``llvm-lit``; script which is built as part of LLVM. For example, to run the; ``Integer/BitPacked.ll`` test by itself you can run:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm-lit ~/llvm/test/Integer/BitPacked.ll. or to run all of the ARM CodeGen tests:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm-lit ~/llvm/test/CodeGen/ARM. The regression tests will use the Python psutil module only if installed in a; **non-user** location. Under Linux, install with sudo or within a virtual; environment. Under Windows, install Python for all users and then run; ``pip install psutil`` in an elevated command prompt.

Laziness in ORC is provided by a utility called ""lazy reexports"". A lazy; reexport is similar to a regular reexport or alias: It provides a new name for; an existing symbol. Unlike regular reexports however, lookups of lazy reexports; do not trigger immediate materialization of the reexported symbol. Instead, they; only trigger materialization of a function stub. This function stub is; initialized to point at a *lazy call-through*, which provides reentry into the; JIT. If the stub is called at runtime then the lazy call-through will look up; the reexported symbol (triggering materialization for it if necessary), update; the stub (to call directly to the reexported symbol on subsequent calls), and; then return via the reexported symbol. By re-using the existing symbol lookup; mechanism, lazy reexports inherit the same concurrency guarantees: calls to lazy; reexports can be made from multiple threads concurrently, and the reexported; symbol can be any state of compilation (uncompiled, already in the process of; being compiled, or already compiled) and the call will succeed. This allows; laziness to be safely mixed with features like remote compilation, concurrent; compilation, concurrent JIT'd code, and speculative compilation.

Testability,"lent @func``. A '``dso_local_equivalent``' constant represents a function which is; functionally equivalent to a given function, but is always defined in the; current linkage unit. The resulting pointer has the same type as the underlying; function. The resulting pointer is permitted, but not required, to be different; from a pointer to the function, and it may have different values in different; translation units. The target function may not have ``extern_weak`` linkage. ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented as such:. - If the function has local linkage, hidden visibility, or is; ``dso_local``, ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented as simply a pointer; to the function.; - ``dso_local_equivalent`` can be implemented with a stub that tail-calls the; function. Many targets support relocations that resolve at link time to either; a function or a stub for it, depending on if the function is defined within the; linkage unit; LLVM will use this when available. (This is commonly called a; ""PLT stub"".) On other targets, the stub may need to be emitted explicitly. This can be used wherever a ``dso_local`` instance of a function is needed without; needing to explicitly make the original function ``dso_local``. An instance where; this can be used is for static offset calculations between a function and some other; ``dso_local`` symbol. This is especially useful for the Relative VTables C++ ABI,; where dynamic relocations for function pointers in VTables can be replaced with; static relocations for offsets between the VTable and virtual functions which; may not be ``dso_local``. This is currently only supported for ELF binary formats. .. _no_cfi:. No CFI; ------. ``no_cfi @func``.

The ``-O1`` is important because ``-O0`` adds the ``optnone``; function attribute to all functions and many passes don't run on ``optnone``; functions.

Testability,"les are copied to llvm/include/llvm/Demangle. The simple reason for; this comes from before the monorepo, and both [sub]projects need to; demangle symbols, but neither can depend on each other. * libcxxabi needs the demangler to implement __cxa_demangle, which is; part of the itanium ABI spec. * LLVM needs a copy for a bunch of places, and cannot rely on the; system's __cxa_demangle because it a) might not be available (i.e.,; on Windows), and b) may not be up-to-date on the latest language; features. The copy of the demangler in LLVM has some extra stuff that aren't; needed in libcxxabi (ie, the MSVC demangler, ItaniumPartialDemangler),; which depend on the shared generic components. Despite these; differences, we want to keep the ""core"" generic demangling library; identical between both copies to simplify development and testing. If you're working on the generic library, then do the work first in; libcxxabi, then run libcxxabi/src/demangle/cp-to-llvm.sh. This; script takes as an optional argument the path to llvm, and copies the; changes you made to libcxxabi over. Note that this script just; blindly overwrites all changes to the generic library in llvm, so be; careful. Because the core demangler needs to work in libcxxabi, everything; needs to be declared in an anonymous namespace (see; DEMANGLE_NAMESPACE_BEGIN), and you can't introduce any code that; depends on the libcxx dylib. FIXME: Now that LLVM is a monorepo, it should be possible to; de-duplicate this code, and have both LLVM and libcxxabi depend on a; shared demangler library. Testing; -------. The tests are split up between libcxxabi/test/{unit,}test_demangle.cpp, and; llvm/unittest/Demangle. The llvm directory should only get tests for stuff not; included in the core library. In the future though, we should probably move all; the tests to LLVM.

As a special case, ``XFAIL: *`` is expected to fail everywhere. .. code-block:: llvm. ; This test is disabled when running on Windows,; ; and is disabled when targeting Linux, except for Android Linux.; ; UNSUPPORTED: system-windows, target={{.*linux.*}} && !target={{.*android.*}}; ; This test is expected to fail when targeting PowerPC or running on Darwin.; ; XFAIL: target=powerpc{{.*}}, system-darwin. Tips for writing constraints; ----------------------------. **``REQUIRES`` and ``UNSUPPORTED``**. These are logical inverses. In principle, ``UNSUPPORTED`` isn't absolutely; necessary (the logical negation could be used with ``REQUIRES`` to get; exactly the same effect), but it can make these clauses easier to read and; understand. Generally, people use ``REQUIRES`` to state things that the test; depends on to operate correctly, and ``UNSUPPORTED`` to exclude cases where; the test is expected never to work. **``UNSUPPORTED`` and ``XFAIL``**. Both of these indicate that the test isn't expected to work; however, they; have different effects. ``UNSUPPORTED`` causes the test to be skipped;; this saves execution time, but then you'll never know whether the test; actually would start working. Conversely, ``XFAIL`` actually runs the test; but expects a failure output, taking extra execution time but alerting you; if/when the test begins to behave correctly (an XPASS test result). You; need to decide which is more appropriate in each case. **Using ``target=...``**. Checking the target triple can be tricky; it's easy to mis-specify. For; example, ``target=mips{{.*}}`` will match not only mips, but also mipsel,; mips64, and mips64el. ``target={{.*}}-linux-gnu`` will match; x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, but not armv8l-unknown-linux-gnueabihf.; Prefer to use hyphens to delimit triple components (``target=mips-{{.*}}",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:22150,test,test,22150,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,2,['test'],['test']

If your test requires extra files besides the file containing the ``RUN:`` lines; and the extra files are small, consider specifying them in the same file and; using ``split-file`` to extract them. For example,. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: split-file %s %t; ; RUN: llvm-link -S %t/a.ll %t/b.ll | FileCheck %s. ; CHECK: ... ;--- a.ll; ...; ;--- b.ll; ... The parts are separated by the regex ``^(.|//)--- <part>``. If you want to test relative line numbers like ``[[#@LINE+1]]``, specify; ``--leading-lines`` to add leading empty lines to preserve line numbers. If the extra files are large, the idiomatic place to put them is in a subdirectory ``Inputs``.; You can then refer to the extra files as ``%S/Inputs/foo.bar``. For example, consider ``test/Linker/ident.ll``. The directory structure is; as follows::. test/; Linker/; ident.ll; Inputs/; ident.a.ll; ident.b.ll. For convenience, these are the contents:. .. code-block:: llvm. ;;;;; ident.ll:. ; RUN: llvm-link %S/Inputs/ident.a.ll %S/Inputs/ident.b.ll -S | FileCheck %s. ; Verify that multiple input llvm.ident metadata are linked together. ; CHECK-DAG: !llvm.ident = !{!0, !1, !2}; ; CHECK-DAG: ""Compiler V1""; ; CHECK-DAG: ""Compiler V2""; ; CHECK-DAG: ""Compiler V3"". ;;;;; Inputs/ident.a.ll:. !llvm.ident = !{!0, !1}; !0 = metadata !{metadata !""Compiler V1""}; !1 = metadata !{metadata !""Compiler V2""}. ;;;;; Inputs/ident.b.ll:. !llvm.ident = !{!0}; !0 = metadata !{metadata !""Compiler V3""}. For symmetry reasons, ``ident.ll`` is just a dummy file that doesn't; actually participate in the test besides holding the ``RUN:`` lines. .. note::.

Testability,"lgorithms, or with different kinds of optimization ""back-ends"" in mind.; One implementation of each is ready for use in `RooFit` currently:. 1. `LikelihoodSerial` is more or less simply a rewrite of the existing serial calculation of a `RooNLLVar`.; 2. `LikelihoodGradientJob` calculates the partial derivatives or the gradient in parallel on multiple CPUs/cores, based on `RooFit::MultiProcess`, which is a fork-based multi-processing task execution framework with dynamic load balancing. Other possible implementations could use the GPU or external tools like TensorFlow. The coupling of all these classes to `RooMinimizer` is made via the `MinuitFcnGrad` class, which owns the `Wrappers` that calculate the likelihood components. Note: a second `LikelihoodWrapper` class called `LikelihoodJob` is also available.; This class emulates the existing `NumCPU(>1)` functionality of the `RooAbsTestStatistic` tree, which is implemented based on `RooRealMPFE`.; This class is not yet thoroughly tested and should not be considered production ready. ### Usage example: `MultiProcess` enabled parallel gradient calculator. The main selling point of using `RooFit::TestStatistics` from a performance point of view is the implementation of the `RooFit::MultiProcess` based `LikelihoodGradientJob` calculator class.; To use it, one should create a `RooMinimizer` using the new constructor that takes a `RooAbsL`-based likelihood instead of a `RooAbsReal`. Taking any of the above created `likelihood` objects (as long as they are in a `std::shared_ptr`), we can create a `RooMinimizer` with parallel gradient calculation using:; ``` {.cpp}; std::shared_ptr<RooAbsL> likelihood = /* see examples above */;; RooMinimizer m(likelihood);; ```. By default, `RooFit::MultiProcess` spins up as many workers as there are cores in the system (as detected by `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`).; To change the number of workers, call `RooFit::MultiProcess::Config::setDefaultNWorkers(desired_N_workers)` **before** ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md:7935,test,tested,7935,roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md,1,['test'],['tested']

For instance, x86_64 will; obviously not need ``-no-64bit`` while 32-bit systems will, or the script will; fail. The important flags to get right are:. * On the pre-release, you should change ``-rc 1`` to ``-final``. On RC2,; change it to ``-rc 2`` and so on. * On non-release testing, you can use ``-final`` in conjunction with; ``-no-checkout``, but you'll have to create the ``final`` directory by hand; and link the correct source dir to ``final/llvm.src``. * For release candidates, you need ``-test-asserts``, or it won't create a; ""Release+Asserts"" directory, which is needed for release testing and; benchmarking. This will take twice as long. * On the final candidate you just need Release builds, and that's the binary; directory you'll have to pack. * On macOS, you must export ``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9`` before running; the script. This script builds three phases of Clang+LLVM twice each (Release and; Release+Asserts), so use screen or nohup to avoid headaches, since it'll take; a long time.

JITStdLibJD.define(absoluteSymbols(SymbolMap({; { Mangle(""__MyJITInstance""),; { ExecutorAddr::fromPtr(&J), JITSymbolFlags() } }; });. Aliases and Reexports; ---------------------. Aliases and reexports allow you to define new symbols that map to existing; symbols. This can be useful for changing linkage relationships between symbols; across sessions without having to recompile code. For example, imagine that; JIT'd code has access to a log function, ``void log(const char*)`` for which; there are two implementations in the JIT standard library: ``log_fast`` and; ``log_detailed``. Your JIT can choose which one of these definitions will be; used when the ``log`` symbol is referenced by setting up an alias at JIT startup; time:. .. code-block:: c++. auto &JITStdLibJD = ... ;. auto LogImplementationSymbol =; Verbose ? Mangle(""log_detailed"") : Mangle(""log_fast"");. JITStdLibJD.define(; symbolAliases(SymbolAliasMap({; { Mangle(""log""),; { LogImplementationSymbol; JITSymbolFlags::Exported | JITSymbolFlags::Callable } }; });. The ``symbolAliases`` function allows you to define aliases within a single; JITDylib. The ``reexports`` function provides the same functionality, but; operates across JITDylib boundaries. E.g. .. code-block:: c++. auto &JD1 = ... ;; auto &JD2 = ... ;. // Make 'bar' in JD2 an alias for 'foo' from JD1.; JD2.define(; reexports(JD1, SymbolAliasMap({; { Mangle(""bar""), { Mangle(""foo""), JITSymbolFlags::Exported } }; });.

The program `$ROOTSYS/test/bench.cxx` compares the I/O performance of; STL vectors to the ROOT native **`TClonesArray`**`s` collection class.; It creates trees with and without compression for the following cases:; `vector<THit>`, `vector<THit*>`, `TClonesArray(`**`TObjHit`**`)`; not split `TClonesArray(`**`TObjHit`**`)` split.

The most; significant difference is in reading a file without compression. The file size with compression, write times with and without compression; and the read times with and without compression all favor the; **`TClonesArray`**. ## Impact of Compression on I/O. This benchmark illustrates the pros and cons of the compression option.; We recommend using compression when the time spent in I/O is small; compared to the total processing time. In this case, if the I/O; operation is increased by a factor of 5 it is still a small percentage; of the total time and it may very well save a factor of 10 on disk; space. On the other hand if the time spend on I/O is large, compression; may slow down the program's performance.

The; ""``<cassert>``"" header file is probably already included by the header files you; are using, so it doesn't cost anything to use it. To further assist with debugging, make sure to put some kind of error message in; the assertion statement, which is printed if the assertion is tripped.

Here is one complete example:. .. code-block:: c++. inline Value *getOperand(unsigned I) {; assert(I < Operands.size() && ""getOperand() out of range!"");; return Operands[I];; }. Here are more examples:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(Ty->isPointerType() && ""Can't allocate a non-pointer type!"");. assert((Opcode == Shl || Opcode == Shr) && ""ShiftInst Opcode invalid!"");. assert(idx < getNumSuccessors() && ""Successor # out of range!"");. assert(V1.getType() == V2.getType() && ""Constant types must be identical!"");. assert(isa<PHINode>(Succ->front()) && ""Only works on PHId BBs!"");.

If modifying ``CFLAGS`` of a large project, which also compiles executables; requiring their own ``main`` symbol, it may be desirable to request just the; instrumentation without linking::. clang -fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link mytarget.c. Then libFuzzer can be linked to the desired driver by passing in; ``-fsanitize=fuzzer`` during the linking stage. .. _libfuzzer-corpus:. Corpus; ------. Coverage-guided fuzzers like libFuzzer rely on a corpus of sample inputs for the; code under test. This corpus should ideally be seeded with a varied collection; of valid and invalid inputs for the code under test; for example, for a graphics; library the initial corpus might hold a variety of different small PNG/JPG/GIF; files. The fuzzer generates random mutations based around the sample inputs in; the current corpus. If a mutation triggers execution of a previously-uncovered; path in the code under test, then that mutation is saved to the corpus for; future variations. LibFuzzer will work without any initial seeds, but will be less; efficient if the library under test accepts complex,; structured inputs. The corpus can also act as a sanity/regression check, to confirm that the; fuzzing entrypoint still works and that all of the sample inputs run through; the code under test without problems. If you have a large corpus (either generated by fuzzing or acquired by other means); you may want to minimize it while still preserving the full coverage. One way to do that; is to use the `-merge=1` flag:. .. code-block:: console. mkdir NEW_CORPUS_DIR # Store minimized corpus here.; ./my_fuzzer -merge=1 NEW_CORPUS_DIR FULL_CORPUS_DIR. You may use the same flag to add more interesting items to an existing corpus.; Only the inputs that trigger new coverage will be added to the first corpus. .. code-block:: console. ./my_fuzzer -merge=1 CURRENT_CORPUS_DIR NEW_POTENTIALLY_INTERESTING_INPUT",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst:4564,test,test,4564,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"lit - LLVM Integrated Tester; ============================. .. program:: lit. SYNOPSIS; --------. :program:`lit` [*options*] [*tests*]. DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`lit` is a portable tool for executing LLVM and Clang style test; suites, summarizing their results, and providing indication of failures.; :program:`lit` is designed to be a lightweight testing tool with as simple a; user interface as possible. :program:`lit` should be run with one or more *tests* to run specified on the; command line. Tests can be either individual test files or directories to; search for tests (see :ref:`test-discovery`). Each specified test will be executed (potentially concurrently) and once all; tests have been run :program:`lit` will print summary information on the number; of tests which passed or failed (see :ref:`test-status-results`). The; :program:`lit` program will execute with a non-zero exit code if any tests; fail. By default :program:`lit` will use a succinct progress display and will only; print summary information for test failures. See :ref:`output-options` for; options controlling the :program:`lit` progress display and output. :program:`lit` also includes a number of options for controlling how tests are; executed (specific features may depend on the particular test format). See; :ref:`execution-options` for more information. Finally, :program:`lit` also supports additional options for only running a; subset of the options specified on the command line, see; :ref:`selection-options` for more information. :program:`lit` parses options from the environment variable ``LIT_OPTS`` after; parsing options from the command line. ``LIT_OPTS`` is primarily useful for; supplementing or overriding the command-line options supplied to :program:`lit`; by ``check`` targets defined by a project's build system. :program:`lit` can also read options from response files which are specified as; inputs using the ``@path/to/file.rsp`` syntax.

If you are a new contributor, you; will not be able to select reviewers in such a way, in which case you can still; get the attention of potential reviewers by CC'ing them in a comment -- just; @name them. A reviewer may request changes or ask questions during the review. If you are; uncertain on how to provide test cases, documentation, etc., feel free to ask; for guidance during the review. Please address the feedback and re-post an; updated version of your patch. This cycle continues until all requests and comments; have been addressed and a reviewer accepts the patch with a `Looks good to me` or `LGTM`.; Once that is done the change can be committed. If you do not have commit; access, please let people know during the review and someone should commit it; on your behalf. If you have received no comments on your patch for a week, you can request a; review by 'ping'ing the GitHub PR with ""Ping"". The common courtesy 'ping' rate; is once a week.

For example, if a program assumes; a pointer to be a member of ``!""_ZST1A""``, we know that the address can; be only be one of ``_ZTV1A+16``, ``_ZTV1B+16`` or ``_ZTV1D+16`` (i.e. the; address points of the vtables of A, B and D respectively). If we then load; an address from that pointer, we know that the address can only be one of; ``&A::f``, ``&B::f`` or ``&D::f``. .. _address point: https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#vtable-general. Testing Addresses For Type Membership; =====================================. If a program tests an address using ``llvm.type.test``, this will cause; a link-time optimization pass, ``LowerTypeTests``, to replace calls to this; intrinsic with efficient code to perform type member tests. At a high level,; the pass will lay out referenced globals in a consecutive memory region in; the object file, construct bit vectors that map onto that memory region,; and generate code at each of the ``llvm.type.test`` call sites to test; pointers against those bit vectors. Because of the layout manipulation, the; globals' definitions must be available at LTO time. For more information,; see the `control flow integrity design document`_. A type identifier that identifies functions is transformed into a jump table,; which is a block of code consisting of one branch instruction for each; of the functions associated with the type identifier that branches to the; target function. The pass will redirect any taken function addresses to the; corresponding jump table entry. In the object file's symbol table, the jump; table entries take the identities of the original functions, so that addresses; taken outside the module will pass any verification done inside the module. Jump tables may call external functions, so their definitions need not; be available at LTO time. Note that if an externally defined function is; associated with a type identifier, there is no guarantee that its identity; within the module will be the same as its i",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TypeMetadata.rst:5411,test,test,5411,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TypeMetadata.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TypeMetadata.rst,2,['test'],['test']

Function definitions and calls also work, but something went very wrong on that; last line. The call looks valid, so what happened? As you may have guessed from; the API a Module is a unit of allocation for the JIT, and testfunc was part; of the same module that contained anonymous expression. When we removed that; module from the JIT to free the memory for the anonymous expression, we deleted; the definition of ``testfunc`` along with it. Then, when we tried to call; testfunc a second time, the JIT could no longer find it. The easiest way to fix this is to put the anonymous expression in a separate; module from the rest of the function definitions. The JIT will happily resolve; function calls across module boundaries, as long as each of the functions called; has a prototype, and is added to the JIT before it is called. By putting the; anonymous expression in a different module we can delete it without affecting; the rest of the functions. In fact, we're going to go a step further and put every function in its own; module. Doing so allows us to exploit a useful property of the KaleidoscopeJIT; that will make our environment more REPL-like: Functions can be added to the; JIT ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl04.rst:16533,test,testfunc,16533,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl04.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl04.rst,1,['test'],['testfunc']

For more information on using the :program:`lit` tool, see ``llvm-lit --help``; or the :doc:`lit man page <CommandGuide/lit>`. Debugging Information tests; ---------------------------. To run debugging information tests simply add the ``cross-project-tests``; project to your ``LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`` define on the cmake; command-line. Regression test structure; =========================. The LLVM regression tests are driven by :program:`lit` and are located in the; ``llvm/test`` directory. This directory contains a large array of small tests that exercise; various features of LLVM and to ensure that regressions do not occur.; The directory is broken into several sub-directories, each focused on a; particular area of LLVM. Writing new regression tests; ----------------------------. The regression test structure is very simple, but does require some; information to be set. This information is gathered via ``cmake``; and is written to a file, ``test/lit.site.cfg.py`` in the build directory.; The ``llvm/test`` Makefile does this work for you. In order for the regression tests to work, each directory of tests must; have a ``lit.local.cfg`` file. :program:`lit` looks for this file to determine; how to run the tests. This file is just Python code and thus is very; flexible, but we've standardized it for the LLVM regression tests. If; you're adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from; another directory to get running. The standard ``lit.local.cfg`` simply; specifies which files to look in for tests. Any directory that contains; only directories does not need the ``lit.local.cfg`` file. Read the :doc:`Lit; documentation <CommandGuide/lit>` for more information. Each test file must contain lines starting with ""RUN:"" that tell :program:`lit`; how to run it. If there are no RUN lines, :program:`lit` will issue an error; while running a test.

The ``-check <check-file>`` option can be used to run a set of ``jitlink-check``; expressions against working memory. It is typically used in conjunction with; ``-noexec``, since the aim is to validate JIT'd memory rather than to run the; code and ``-noexec`` allows us to link for any supported target architecture; from the current process. In ``-check`` mode, ``llvm-jitlink`` will scan the; given check-file for lines of the form ``# jitlink-check: <expr>``. See; examples of this usage in ``llvm/test/ExecutionEngine/JITLink``.

For example, if you would like to write a test; for the post register allocation pseudo instruction expansion pass, you can; specify the machine copy propagation pass in the ``-stop-after`` option, as it; runs just before the pass that we are trying to test:. ``llc -stop-after=machine-cp bug-trigger.ll -o test.mir``.

Given an LLVM opcode name and a benchmarking mode, :program:`llvm-exegesis`; generates a code snippet that makes execution as serial (resp. as parallel) as; possible so that we can measure the latency (resp. inverse throughput/uop decomposition); of the instruction.; The code snippet is jitted and, unless requested not to, executed on the; host subtarget. The time taken (resp. resource usage) is measured using; hardware performance counters. The result is printed out as YAML; to the standard output. The main goal of this tool is to automatically (in)validate the LLVM's TableDef; scheduling models.

SYNOPSIS; --------. :program:`llvm-symbolizer` [*options*] [*addresses...*]. DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`llvm-symbolizer` reads input names and addresses from the command-line; and prints corresponding source code locations to standard output. It can also; symbolize logs containing :doc:`Symbolizer Markup </SymbolizerMarkupFormat>` via; :option:`--filter-markup`. Addresses may be specified as numbers or symbol names. If no address is specified on the command-line, it reads the addresses from; standard input. If no input name is specified on the command-line, but addresses; are, the first address value is treated as an input name. If an input value is not; recognized, it reports that source information is not found. Input names can be specified together with the addresses either on standard; input or as positional arguments on the command-line. By default, input names; are interpreted as object file paths. However, prefixing a name with; ``BUILDID:`` states that it is a hex build ID rather than a path. This will look; up the corresponding debug binary. For consistency, prefixing a name with; ``FILE:`` explicitly states that it is an object file path (the default). A positional argument or standard input value can be preceded by ""DATA"" or; ""CODE"" to indicate that the address should be symbolized as data or executable; code respectively. If neither is specified, ""CODE"" is assumed. DATA is; symbolized as address and symbol size rather than line number. :program:`llvm-symbolizer` parses options from the environment variable; ``LLVM_SYMBOLIZER_OPTS`` after parsing options from the command line.; ``LLVM_SYMBOLIZER_OPTS`` is primarily useful for supplementing the command-line; options when :program:`llvm-symbolizer` is invoked by another program or; runtime.

Testability,"lly command line tools) this can be a reasonable approach. Calling; ``exit`` upon encountering an error dramatically simplifies control flow as the; error no longer needs to be propagated up the stack. This allows code to be; written in straight-line style, as long as each fallible call is wrapped in a; check and call to exit. The ``ExitOnError`` class supports this pattern by; providing call operators that inspect ``Error`` values, stripping the error away; in the success case and logging to ``stderr`` then exiting in the failure case. To use this class, declare a global ``ExitOnError`` variable in your program:. .. code-block:: c++. ExitOnError ExitOnErr;. Calls to fallible functions can then be wrapped with a call to ``ExitOnErr``,; turning them into non-failing calls:. .. code-block:: c++. Error mayFail();; Expected<int> mayFail2();. void foo() {; ExitOnErr(mayFail());; int X = ExitOnErr(mayFail2());; }. On failure, the error's log message will be written to ``stderr``, optionally; preceded by a string ""banner"" that can be set by calling the setBanner method. A; mapping can also be supplied from ``Error`` values to exit codes using the; ``setExitCodeMapper`` method:. .. code-block:: c++. int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {; ExitOnErr.setBanner(std::string(argv[0]) + "" error:"");; ExitOnErr.setExitCodeMapper(; [](const Error &Err) {; if (Err.isA<BadFileFormat>()); return 2;; return 1;; });.

Testability,"logic is; defined by *test suites*. TEST SUITES; ~~~~~~~~~~~. As described in :ref:`test-discovery`, tests are always located inside a *test; suite*. Test suites serve to define the format of the tests they contain, the; logic for finding those tests, and any additional information to run the tests. :program:`lit` identifies test suites as directories containing ``lit.cfg`` or; ``lit.site.cfg`` files (see also :option:`--config-prefix`). Test suites are; initially discovered by recursively searching up the directory hierarchy for; all the input files passed on the command line. You can use; :option:`--show-suites` to display the discovered test suites at startup. Once a test suite is discovered, its config file is loaded. Config files; themselves are Python modules which will be executed. When the config file is; executed, two important global variables are predefined:. **lit_config**. The global **lit** configuration object (a *LitConfig* instance), which defines; the builtin test formats, global configuration parameters, and other helper; routines for implementing test configurations. **config**. This is the config object (a *TestingConfig* instance) for the test suite,; which the config file is expected to populate. The following variables are also; available on the *config* object, some of which must be set by the config and; others are optional or predefined:. **name** *[required]* The name of the test suite, for use in reports and; diagnostics. **test_format** *[required]* The test format object which will be used to; discover and run tests in the test suite. Generally this will be a builtin test; format available from the *lit.formats* module. **test_source_root** The filesystem path to the test suite root. For out-of-dir; builds this is the directory that will be scanned for tests. **test_exec_root** For out-of-dir builds, the path to the test suite root inside; the object directory. This is where tests will be run and temporary output files; placed. **enviro",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst:15102,test,test,15102,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst,2,['test'],['test']

Testability,"lp build times over Make, particularly for highly; parallel builds. LLD helps to reduce both link times and memory usage; during linking significantly. With a build machine with sufficient; parallelism, link times tend to dominate critical path of the build, and are; thus worth optimizing. Use CCache and NOT incremental builds; Using ccache materially improves average build times. Incremental builds; can be slightly faster, but introduce the risk of build corruption due to; e.g. state changes, etc... At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental builds and instead use ccache as the latter captures the; majority of the benefit with less risk of false positives. One of the non-obvious benefits of using ccache is that it makes the; builder less sensitive to which projects are being monitored vs built.; If a change triggers a build request, but doesn't change the build output; (e.g. doc changes, python utility changes, etc..), the build will entirely; hit in cache and the build request will complete in just the testing time. With multiple workers, it is tempting to try to configure a shared cache; between the workers. Experience to date indicates this is difficult to; well, and that having local per-worker caches gets most of the benefit; anyways. We don't currently recommend shared caches. CCache does depend on the builder hardware having sufficient IO to access; the cache with reasonable access times - i.e. a fast disk, or enough memory; for a RAM cache, etc.. For builders without, incremental may be your best; option, but is likely to require higher ongoing involvement from the; sponsor. Enable batch builds; As a last resort, you can configure your builder to batch build requests.; This makes the build failure notifications markedly less actionable, and; should only be done once all other reasonable measures have been taken.

Examining the AST; =================. A good way to familiarize yourself with the Clang AST is to actually look; at it on some simple example code. Clang has a builtin AST-dump mode,; which can be enabled with the flag ``-ast-dump``.

Testability,"ls. Setup Clang Tooling Using CMake and Make; ========================================. If you intend to use make to build LLVM, you should have CMake 2.8.6 or; later installed (can be found `here <https://cmake.org>`_). First, you need to generate Makefiles for LLVM with CMake. You need to; make a build directory and run CMake from it:. .. code-block:: console. $ mkdir your/build/directory; $ cd your/build/directory; $ cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON path/to/llvm/sources. If you want to use clang instead of GCC, you can add; ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/clang++``.; You can also use ``ccmake``, which provides a curses interface to configure; CMake variables. As a result, the new ``compile_commands.json`` file should appear in the; current directory. You should link it to the LLVM source tree so that; Clang Tooling is able to use it:. .. code-block:: console. $ ln -s $PWD/compile_commands.json path/to/llvm/source/. Now you are ready to build and test LLVM using make:. .. code-block:: console. $ make check-all. Setup Clang Tooling Using CMake on Windows; ==========================================. For Windows developers, the Visual Studio project generators in CMake do; not support `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS; <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html>`_.; However, the Ninja generator does support this variable and can be used; on Windows to generate a suitable ``compile_commands.json`` that invokes; the MSVC compiler. First, you will need to install `Ninja`_. Once installed, the Ninja; executable will need to be in your search path for CMake to locate it. Next, assuming you already have Visual Studio installed on your machine, you; need to have the appropriate environment variables configured so that CMake; will locate the MSVC compiler for the Ninja generator.

The test suite contains tests to check quality of debugging information.; The test are written in C based languages or in LLVM assembly language. These tests are compiled and run under a debugger. The debugger output; is checked to validate of debugging information. See README.txt in the; test suite for more information. This test suite is located in the; ``cross-project-tests/debuginfo-tests`` directory. Quick start; ===========. The tests are located in two separate repositories. The unit and; regression tests are in the main ""llvm""/ directory under the directories; ``llvm/unittests`` and ``llvm/test`` (so you get these tests for free with the; main LLVM tree). Use ``make check-all`` to run the unit and regression tests; after building LLVM. The ``test-suite`` module contains more comprehensive tests including whole C; and C++ programs. See the :doc:`TestSuiteGuide` for details. Unit and Regression tests; -------------------------. To run all of the LLVM unit tests use the check-llvm-unit target:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-llvm-unit. To run all of the LLVM regression tests use the check-llvm target:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-llvm. In order to get reasonable testing performance, build LLVM and subprojects; in release mode, i.e. .. code-block:: bash. % cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=""Release"" -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=On. If you have `Clang <https://clang.llvm.org/>`_ checked out and built, you; can run the LLVM and Clang tests simultaneously using:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-all. To run the tests with Valgrind (Memcheck by default), use the ``LIT_ARGS`` make; variable to pass the required options to lit. For example, you can use:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check LIT_ARGS=""-v --vg --vg-leak"". to enable testing with valgrind and with leak checking enabled.

The arguments `x1`, `x2` defines the new range in the x direction, and; the `y1`, `y2` define the new range in the y-direction. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TCanvas MyCanvas (""MyCanvas""); root[] gPad->Range(-100,-100,100,100); ```. This will set the active pad to have both coordinates to go from -100 to; 100, with the center of the pad at (0,0). You can visually check the; coordinates by viewing the status bar in the canvas. To display the; status bar select Event Status entry in the View canvas menu. ![The status bar](pictures/020000A4.jpg). #### The Normalized Coordinate System (NDC). Normalized coordinates are independent of the window size and of the; user system. The coordinates range from 0 to 1 and (0, 0) corresponds to; the bottom-left corner of the pad. Several internal ROOT functions use; the NDC system (3D primitives, PostScript, log scale mapping to linear; scale). You may want to use this system if the user coordinates are not; known ahead of time. #### The Pixel Coordinate System. The least common is the pixel coordinate system, used by functions such; as `DistancetoPrimitive()` and `ExecuteEvent()`. Its primary use is for; cursor position, which is always given in pixel coordinates. If; (`px,py`) is the cursor position, `px=0` and `py=0` corresponds to the; top-left corner of the pad, which is the standard convention in; windowing systems. #### Using NDC for a particular Object. Most of the time, you will be using the user coordinate system. But; sometimes, you will want to use NDC. For example, if you want to draw; text always at the same place over a histogram, no matter what the; histogram coordinates are. There are two ways to do this. You can set; the NDC for one object or may convert NDC to user coordinates. Most; graphical objects offer an option to be drawn in NDC.

The test failed. **UNRESOLVED**. The test result could not be determined. For example, this occurs when the test; could not be run, the test itself is invalid, or the test was interrupted. **UNSUPPORTED**. The test is not supported in this environment. This is used by test formats; which can report unsupported tests. **TIMEOUT**. The test was run, but it timed out before it was able to complete. This is; considered a failure.

You can do; this by running the tests as described in the previous sections. Once the; tests have started running, you can stop them with control+C, as the; files are generated before running any tests.; Once that is done, to run all the tests from the command line,; execute a command like the following:. python (path to llvm)\llvm\utils\lit\lit.py -sv; --param=build_mode=Win32 --param=build_config=Debug; --param=clang_site_config=(build dir)\tools\clang\test\lit.site.cfg; (path to llvm)\llvm\tools\clang\test.

You may also need to specify; the build mode (Win32, etc) via --param=build_mode=(build mode).; Additionally, you will need to specify the lit site configuration which; lives in (build dir)\tools\clang\test, via; --param=clang_site_config=(build dir)\tools\clang\test\lit.site.cfg.; ; To run a single test:. python (path to llvm)\llvm\utils\lit\lit.py -sv; --param=build_mode=Win32 --param=build_config=Debug; --param=clang_site_config=(build dir)\tools\clang\test\lit.site.cfg; (path to llvm)\llvm\tools\clang\test\(dir)\(test).

Testability,"lying motivation of the approach is that it is common for; the same (and often large) header files to be included by multiple; source files. Consequently, compile times can often be greatly improved; by caching some of the (redundant) work done by a compiler to process; headers. Precompiled header files, which represent one of many ways to; implement this optimization, are literally files that represent an; on-disk cache that contains the vital information necessary to reduce; some of the work needed to process a corresponding header file. While; details of precompiled headers vary between compilers, precompiled; headers have been shown to be highly effective at speeding up program; compilation on systems with very large system headers (e.g., macOS). Generating a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. To generate a PCH file using Clang, one invokes Clang with the; `-x <language>-header` option. This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch. Using a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A PCH file can then be used as a prefix header when a ``-include-pch``; option is passed to ``clang``:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test. The ``clang`` driver will check if the PCH file ``test.h.pch`` is; available; if so, the contents of ``test.h`` (and the files it includes); will be processed from the PCH file. Otherwise, Clang will report an error. .. note::. Clang does *not* automatically use PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``.

If an optimizer or code generator crashes, ``bugpoint`` will try as hard as it; can to reduce the list of passes (for optimizer crashes) and the size of the; test program. First, ``bugpoint`` figures out which combination of optimizer; passes triggers the bug. This is useful when debugging a problem exposed by; ``opt``, for example, because it runs over 38 passes. Next, ``bugpoint`` tries removing functions from the test program, to reduce its; size. Usually it is able to reduce a test program to a single function, when; debugging intraprocedural optimizations. Once the number of functions has been; reduced, it attempts to delete various edges in the control flow graph, to; reduce the size of the function as much as possible. Finally, ``bugpoint``; deletes any individual LLVM instructions whose absence does not eliminate the; failure.

Generating assertions in regression tests; -----------------------------------------. Some regression test cases are very large and complex to write/update by hand.; In that case to reduce the human work we can use the scripts available in; llvm/utils/ to generate the assertions. For example to generate assertions in an :program:`llc`-based test, after; adding one or more RUN lines use:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc test.ll. This will generate FileCheck assertions, and insert a ``NOTE:`` line at the; top to indicate that assertions were automatically generated. If you want to update assertions in an existing test case, pass the `-u` option; which first checks the ``NOTE:`` line exists and matches the script name. Sometimes a test absolutely depends on hand-written assertions and should not; have assertions automatically generated. In that case, add the text ``NOTE: Do; not autogenerate`` to the first line, and the scripts will skip that test. It; is a good idea to explain why generated assertions will not work for the test; so future developers will understand what is going on.

Testability,"maller; changes increases the odds that any of the work will be committed to the main; repository. To address these problems, LLVM uses an incremental development style and we; require contributors to follow this practice when making a large/invasive; change. Some tips:. * Large/invasive changes usually have a number of secondary changes that are; required before the big change can be made (e.g. API cleanup, etc). These; sorts of changes can often be done before the major change is done,; independently of that work. * The remaining inter-related work should be decomposed into unrelated sets of; changes if possible. Once this is done, define the first increment and get; consensus on what the end goal of the change is. * Each change in the set can be stand alone (e.g. to fix a bug), or part of a; planned series of changes that works towards the development goal. * Each change should be kept as small as possible. This simplifies your work; (into a logical progression), simplifies code review and reduces the chance; that you will get negative feedback on the change. Small increments also; facilitate the maintenance of a high quality code base. * Often, an independent precursor to a big change is to add a new API and slowly; migrate clients to use the new API. Each change to use the new API is often; ""obvious"" and can be committed without review. Once the new API is in place; and used, it is much easier to replace the underlying implementation of the; API. This implementation change is logically separate from the API; change. If you are interested in making a large change, and this scares you, please make; sure to first `discuss the change/gather consensus`_ then ask about the best way; to go about making the change.

While we could do it this way, the most; important role of parentheses are to guide the parser and provide; grouping. Once the parser constructs the AST, parentheses are not; needed. The next simple production is for handling variable references and; function calls:. .. code-block:: c++. /// identifierexpr; /// ::= identifier; /// ::= identifier '(' expression* ')'; static std::unique_ptr<ExprAST> ParseIdentifierExpr() {; std::string IdName = IdentifierStr;. getNextToken(); // eat identifier. if (CurTok != '(') // Simple variable ref.; return std::make_unique<VariableExprAST>(IdName);. // Call.; getNextToken(); // eat (; std::vector<std::unique_ptr<ExprAST>> Args;; if (CurTok != ')') {; while (true) {; if (auto Arg = ParseExpression()); Args.push_back(std::move(Arg));; else; return nullptr;. if (CurTok == ')'); break;. if (CurTok != ','); return LogError(""Expected ')' or ',' in argument list"");; getNextToken();; }; }. // Eat the ')'.; getNextToken();. return std::make_unique<CallExprAST>(IdName, std::move(Args));; }. This routine follows the same style as the other routines. (It expects; to be called if the current token is a ``tok_identifier`` token). It; also has recursion and error handling. One interesting aspect of this is; that it uses *look-ahead* to determine if the current identifier is a; stand alone variable reference or if it is a function call expression.; It handles this by checking to see if the token after the identifier is; a '(' token, constructing either a ``VariableExprAST`` or; ``CallExprAST`` node as appropriate. Now that we have all of our simple expression-parsing logic in place, we; can define a helper function to wrap it together into one entry point.; We call this class of expressions ""primary"" expressions, for reasons; that will become more clear `later in the; tutorial <LangImpl06.html#user-defined-unary-operators>`_.

Finally, the ``LowerFP_TO_SINT`` method is implemented, using an FP register to; convert the floating-point value to an integer. .. code-block:: c++. static SDValue LowerFP_TO_SINT(SDValue Op, SelectionDAG &DAG) {; assert(Op.getValueType() == MVT::i32);; Op = DAG.getNode(SPISD::FTOI, MVT::f32, Op.getOperand(0));; return DAG.getNode(ISD::BITCAST, MVT::i32, Op);; }. Legal; ^^^^^. The ``Legal`` ``LegalizeAction`` enum value simply indicates that an operation; **is** natively supported. ``Legal`` represents the default condition, so it; is rarely used. In ``SparcISelLowering.cpp``, the action for ``CTPOP`` (an; operation to count the bits set in an integer) is natively supported only for; SPARC v9. The following code enables the ``Expand`` conversion technique for; non-v9 SPARC implementations. .. code-block:: c++. setOperationAction(ISD::CTPOP, MVT::i32, Expand);; ...; if (TM.getSubtarget<SparcSubtarget>().isV9()); setOperationAction(ISD::CTPOP, MVT::i32, Legal);.

Testability,"mberExpr() {; auto Result = std::make_unique<NumberExprAST>(NumVal);; getNextToken(); // consume the number; return std::move(Result);; }. This routine is very simple: it expects to be called when the current; token is a ``tok_number`` token. It takes the current number value,; creates a ``NumberExprAST`` node, advances the lexer to the next token,; and finally returns. There are some interesting aspects to this. The most important one is; that this routine eats all of the tokens that correspond to the; production and returns the lexer buffer with the next token (which is; not part of the grammar production) ready to go. This is a fairly; standard way to go for recursive descent parsers. For a better example,; the parenthesis operator is defined like this:. .. code-block:: c++. /// parenexpr ::= '(' expression ')'; static std::unique_ptr<ExprAST> ParseParenExpr() {; getNextToken(); // eat (.; auto V = ParseExpression();; if (!V); return nullptr;. if (CurTok != ')'); return LogError(""expected ')'"");; getNextToken(); // eat ).; return V;; }. This function illustrates a number of interesting things about the; parser:. 1) It shows how we use the LogError routines. When called, this function; expects that the current token is a '(' token, but after parsing the; subexpression, it is possible that there is no ')' waiting. For example,; if the user types in ""(4 x"" instead of ""(4)"", the parser should emit an; error. Because errors can occur, the parser needs a way to indicate that; they happened: in our parser, we return null on an error. 2) Another interesting aspect of this function is that it uses recursion; by calling ``ParseExpression`` (we will soon see that; ``ParseExpression`` can call ``ParseParenExpr``). This is powerful; because it allows us to handle recursive grammars, and keeps each; production very simple. Note that parentheses do not cause construction; of AST nodes themselves. While we could do it this way, the most; important role of parentheses are to guid",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst:8391,Log,LogError,8391,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst,1,['Log'],['LogError']

If we define now `C` as an assembly containing `A` and `B`, positioning; the assembly into `D,E` and `F` will actually position only `A` and; `B `directly into these volumes, taking into account their combined; transformations `A/B` to `C` and `C` to `D/E/F`. This looks much nicer,; is it? In fact, it is and it is not. Of course, we managed to get rid of; the ""unnecessary"" volume `C` in our geometry, but we end-up with a more; flat structure for `D,E` and `F` (more daughters inside). This can get; much worse when extensively used, as in the case: assemblies of; assemblies. For deciding what to choose between using virtual containers or; assemblies for a specific case, one can use for both cases, after the; geometry was closed:. ~~~{.cpp}; gGeoManager->SetTopVolume(ptr_D);; gGeoManager->Test();; gGeoManager->RestoreMasterVolume();; ~~~. The `ptr_D` is a pointer to volume `D` containing the interesting; structure. The test will provide the timing for classifying 1 million; random points inside `D`. \anchor GP01be; #### Examples of Volume Positioning. Now let us make a simple volume representing a copper wire.

Supported Platforms; ===================. UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer is supported on the following operating systems:. * Android; * Linux; * NetBSD; * FreeBSD; * OpenBSD; * macOS; * Windows. The runtime library is relatively portable and platform independent. If the OS; you need is not listed above, UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer may already work for; it, or could be made to work with a minor porting effort. Current Status; ==============. UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer is available on selected platforms starting from LLVM; 3.3. The test suite is integrated into the CMake build and can be run with; ``check-ubsan`` command. Additional Configuration; ========================. UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer adds static check data for each check unless it is; in trap mode. This check data includes the full file name. The option; ``-fsanitize-undefined-strip-path-components=N`` can be used to trim this; information. If ``N`` is positive, file information emitted by; UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer will drop the first ``N`` components from the file; path. If ``N`` is negative, the last ``N`` components will be kept.

When an operator tests a boolean argument, it interprets 0 as false; and non-0 as true. .. warning::; The ``!getop`` and ``!setop`` bang operators are deprecated in favor of; ``!getdagop`` and ``!setdagop``. ``!add(``\ *a*\ ``,`` *b*\ ``, ...)``; This operator adds *a*, *b*, etc., and produces the sum. ``!and(``\ *a*\ ``,`` *b*\ ``, ...)``; This operator does a bitwise AND on *a*, *b*, etc., and produces the; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst:58431,Test,Test,58431,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst,1,['Test'],['Test']

Testability,"message if it's ever reached; and then exit the program. When assertions are disabled (i.e. in release; builds), ``llvm_unreachable`` becomes a hint to compilers to skip generating; code for this branch. If the compiler does not support this, it will fall back; to the ""abort"" implementation. Use ``llvm_unreachable`` to mark a specific point in code that should never be; reached. This is especially desirable for addressing warnings about unreachable; branches, etc., but can be used whenever reaching a particular code path is; unconditionally a bug (not originating from user input; see below) of some kind.; Use of ``assert`` should always include a testable predicate (as opposed to; ``assert(false)``). If the error condition can be triggered by user input then the; recoverable error mechanism described in :doc:`ProgrammersManual` should be; used instead. In cases where this is not practical, ``report_fatal_error`` may; be used. Another issue is that values used only by assertions will produce an ""unused; value"" warning when assertions are disabled. For example, this code will warn:. .. code-block:: c++. unsigned Size = V.size();; assert(Size > 42 && ""Vector smaller than it should be"");. bool NewToSet = Myset.insert(Value);; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");. These are two interesting different cases. In the first case, the call to; ``V.size()`` is only useful for the assert, and we don't want it executed when; assertions are disabled. Code like this should move the call into the assert; itself. In the second case, the side effects of the call must happen whether; the assert is enabled or not. In this case, the value should be cast to void to; disable the warning. To be specific, it is preferred to write the code like; this:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(V.size() > 42 && ""Vector smaller than it should be"");. bool NewToSet = Myset.insert(Value); (void)NewToSet;; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");.

A newly; added class RooHistFunc presents these shapes and is capable of handling negative entries. New PDF error handling structure. New infrastructure has been put into place to propagate and process p.d.f evaluation errors during fitting.; Previously evaluation errors were marked with a zero p.d.f value and propagated as a special condition; in RooAddPdf, RooProdPdf etc to result in a zero top-level p.d.f value that was caught by the RooFit minuit; interface as a special condition. Summary information on the value of the parameters and the observables; was printed for the first 10 occurrences of such conditions. . Now, each p.d.f component that generates an error; in its evaluation logs the error into a separate facility during fitting and the RooFit minuit interface; polls this error logging facility for problems. This allows much more detailed and accurate warning messages; during the minimization phase. The level of verbosity of this new error facility can be controlled with; a new . PrintEvalErrors(Int_t code). argument to fitTo(). .

The primary interface for this class is to return a SamplingDistribution of a given TestStatistic.; The ToyMCSampler had a number of internal changes for improved performance with PROOF. These should be transparent. In addition, a new method was added RooAbsData* GenerateToyData(RooArgSet& paramPoint) that gives public access to the generation of toy data with all the same options for the treatment of nuisance parameters, binned or unbinned data, treatment of the global observables, importance sampling, etc. This is new method particularly useful for producing the expected limit bands where one needs to generate background-only pseudo-experiments in the same way that was used for the primary limit calculation. HypoTestResult. In the process of writing the new HypoTestInverter the conventions for p-values, CLb, CLs+b, and CLs were revisited. The situation is complicated by the fact that when performing a hypothesis test for discovery the null is background-only, but when performing an inverted hypothesis test the null is a signal+background model. The new convention is that the p-value for both the null and the alternate are taken from the same tail (as specified by the test statistic). Both CLs+b and CLb are equivalent to these p-values, and the HypoTestResult has a simple switch SetBackgroundIsAlt() to specify the pairing between (null p-value, alternate p-value) and (CLb, CLs+b). HypoTestInverter, HypoTestInverterResult, HypoTestInverterPlot. These classes have been rewritten for using them with the new hypothesis test calculators. The HypoTestInverter; class can now be constructed by any generic HypoTestCalculator, and both the HybridCalculator and the new; FrequentistCalculator are supported.

Most features are self descriptive - explore, and; if you have a question, drop by on #llvm in IRC to get help. Note that as e-mail is the system of reference for code reviews, and some; people prefer it over a web interface, we do not generate automated mail; when a review changes state, for example by clicking ""Accept Revision"" in; the web interface. Thus, please type LGTM into the comment box to accept; a change from Phabricator. .. _pre-merge-testing:. Pre-merge testing; -----------------. The pre-merge tests are a continuous integration (CI) workflow. The workflow; checks the patches uploaded to Phabricator before a user merges them to the main; branch - thus the term *pre-merge testing*. When a user uploads a patch to Phabricator, Phabricator triggers the checks and; then displays the results. This way bugs in a patch are contained during the; code review stage and do not pollute the main branch. Our goal with pre-merge testing is to report most true problems while strongly; minimizing the number of false positive reports. Our goal is that problems; reported are always actionable. If you notice a false positive, please report; it so that we can identify the cause. If you notice issues or have an idea on how to improve pre-merge checks, please; `create a new issue <https://github.com/google/llvm-premerge-checks/issues/new>`_; or give a ❤️ to an existing one.

The rest of the tools are kept in a separate; directory tree, `clang-tools-extra; <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/clang-tools-extra>`_. This document describes a high-level overview of the organization of; Clang Tools within the project as well as giving an introduction to some; of the more important tools. However, it should be noted that this; document is currently focused on Clang and Clang Tool developers, not on; end users of these tools. Clang Tools Organization; ========================. Clang Tools are CLI or GUI programs that are intended to be directly; used by C++ developers. That is they are *not* primarily for use by; Clang developers, although they are hopefully useful to C++ developers; who happen to work on Clang, and we try to actively dogfood their; functionality. They are developed in three components: the underlying; infrastructure for building a standalone tool based on Clang, core; shared logic used by many different tools in the form of refactoring and; rewriting libraries, and the tools themselves. The underlying infrastructure for Clang Tools is the; :doc:`LibTooling <LibTooling>` platform. See its documentation for much; more detailed information about how this infrastructure works. The; common refactoring and rewriting toolkit-style library is also part of; LibTooling organizationally. A few Clang Tools are developed along side the core Clang libraries as; examples and test cases of fundamental functionality. However, most of; the tools are developed in a side repository to provide easy separation; from the core libraries. We intentionally do not support public; libraries in the side repository, as we want to carefully review and; find good APIs for libraries as they are lifted out of a few tools and; into the core Clang library set. Regardless of which repository Clang Tools' code resides in, the; development process and practices for all Clang Tools are ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTools.rst:1351,log,logic,1351,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTools.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ClangTools.rst,1,['log'],['logic']

The way; this is done is to create type metadata named after each of the compatible; classes, with which we associate each of the compatible address points in; each vtable. For example, these type metadata entries encode the compatibility; information for the above hierarchy:. ::. @_ZTV1A = constant [...], !type !0; @_ZTV1B = constant [...], !type !0, !type !1; @_ZTV1C = constant [...], !type !2; @_ZTV1D = constant [...], !type !0, !type !3, !type !4. !0 = !{i64 16, !""_ZTS1A""}; !1 = !{i64 16, !""_ZTS1B""}; !2 = !{i64 16, !""_ZTS1C""}; !3 = !{i64 16, !""_ZTS1D""}; !4 = !{i64 48, !""_ZTS1C""}. With this type metadata, we can now use the ``llvm.type.test`` intrinsic to; test whether a given pointer is compatible with a type identifier. Working; backwards, if ``llvm.type.test`` returns true for a particular pointer,; we can also statically determine the identities of the virtual functions; that a particular virtual call may call. For example, if a program assumes; a pointer to be a member of ``!""_ZST1A""``, we know that the address can; be only be one of ``_ZTV1A+16``, ``_ZTV1B+16`` or ``_ZTV1D+16`` (i.e. the; address points of the vtables of A, B and D respectively). If we then load; an address from that pointer, we know that the address can only be one of; ``&A::f``, ``&B::f`` or ``&D::f``. .. _address point: https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/abi.html#vtable-general. Testing Addresses For Type Membership; =====================================.

Testability,"mpilation fails). Unified Parsing & Pipelining; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Parsing and pipelining both occur without reference to a Compilation; instance. This is by design; the driver expects that both of these; phases are platform neutral, with a few very well defined exceptions; such as whether the platform uses a driver driver. ToolChain Argument Translation; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In order to match gcc very closely, the clang driver currently allows; tool chains to perform their own translation of the argument list (into; a new ArgList data structure). Although this allows the clang driver to; match gcc easily, it also makes the driver operation much harder to; understand (since the Tools stop seeing some arguments the user; provided, and see new ones instead). For example, on Darwin ``-gfull`` gets translated into two separate; arguments, ``-g`` and ``-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-symbols``. Trying to; write Tool logic to do something with ``-gfull`` will not work, because; Tool argument translation is done after the arguments have been; translated. A long term goal is to remove this tool chain specific translation, and; instead force each tool to change its own logic to do the right thing on; the untranslated original arguments. Unused Argument Warnings; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The driver operates by parsing all arguments but giving Tools the; opportunity to choose which arguments to pass on. One downside of this; infrastructure is that if the user misspells some option, or is confused; about which options to use, some command line arguments the user really; cared about may go unused. This problem is particularly important when; using clang as a compiler, since the clang compiler does not support; anywhere near all the options that gcc does, and we want to make sure; users know which ones are being used. To support this, the driver maintains a bit associated with each; argument of whether it has been used (at all) during the compilation.; This bit ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst:13587,log,logic,13587,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,1,['log'],['logic']

The test suite contains whole programs, which are pieces of code which; can be compiled and linked into a stand-alone program that can be; executed. These programs are generally written in high level languages; such as C or C++. These programs are compiled using a user specified compiler and set of; flags, and then executed to capture the program output and timing; information. The output of these programs is compared to a reference; output to ensure that the program is being compiled correctly. In addition to compiling and executing programs, whole program tests; serve as a way of benchmarking LLVM performance, both in terms of the; efficiency of the programs generated as well as the speed with which; LLVM compiles, optimizes, and generates code. The test-suite is located in the ``test-suite``; `repository on GitHub <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git>`_. See the :doc:`TestSuiteGuide` for details.

Honestly, I don't find it much easier than the C syntax.; In either case, I would have to look up an example to write pointers to; member functions.

And; the old array syntax:; type [ int, int, ...]; is just much more familiar and clear to people than anything new you; introduce, no matter how logical it is.

Testability,"mptions, you never know when a bug (not necessarily even yours) might be; caught early by an assertion, which reduces debugging time dramatically. The; ""``<cassert>``"" header file is probably already included by the header files you; are using, so it doesn't cost anything to use it. To further assist with debugging, make sure to put some kind of error message in; the assertion statement, which is printed if the assertion is tripped. This; helps the poor debugger make sense of why an assertion is being made and; enforced, and hopefully what to do about it. Here is one complete example:. .. code-block:: c++. inline Value *getOperand(unsigned I) {; assert(I < Operands.size() && ""getOperand() out of range!"");; return Operands[I];; }. Here are more examples:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(Ty->isPointerType() && ""Can't allocate a non-pointer type!"");. assert((Opcode == Shl || Opcode == Shr) && ""ShiftInst Opcode invalid!"");. assert(idx < getNumSuccessors() && ""Successor # out of range!"");. assert(V1.getType() == V2.getType() && ""Constant types must be identical!"");. assert(isa<PHINode>(Succ->front()) && ""Only works on PHId BBs!"");. You get the idea. In the past, asserts were used to indicate a piece of code that should not be; reached. These were typically of the form:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(0 && ""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. This has a few issues, the main one being that some compilers might not; understand the assertion, or warn about a missing return in builds where; assertions are compiled out. Today, we have something much better: ``llvm_unreachable``:. .. code-block:: c++. llvm_unreachable(""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. When assertions are enabled, this will print the message if it's ever reached; and then exit the program. When assertions are disabled (i.e. in release; builds), ``llvm_unreachable`` becomes a hint to compilers to skip generating; code for this branch. If the compiler does not support this, it will fall back; to the ""abort"" impleme",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst:46056,assert,assert,46056,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,1,['assert'],['assert']

If; an instruction does not define a register, but can be followed by a debug inst,; MIRDebugify inserts a ``DBG_VALUE`` that references a constant. Insertion of; ``DBG_VALUE``'s can be disabled by setting ``-debugify-level=locations``. To run MIRDebugify once, simply insert ``mir-debugify`` into your ``llc``; invocation, like:. .. code-block:: bash. # Before some other pass.; $ llc -run-pass=mir-debugify,other-pass ... # After some other pass.; $ llc -run-pass=other-pass,mir-debugify ... To run MIRDebugify before each pass in a pipeline, use; ``-debugify-and-strip-all-safe``. This can be combined with ``-start-before``; and ``-start-after``. For example:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llc -debugify-and-strip-all-safe -run-pass=... <other llc args>; $ llc -debugify-and-strip-all-safe -O1 <other llc args>. If you want to check it after each pass in a pipeline, use; ``-debugify-check-and-strip-all-safe``. This can also be combined with; ``-start-before`` and ``-start-after``. For example:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llc -debugify-check-and-strip-all-safe -run-pass=... <other llc args>; $ llc -debugify-check-and-strip-all-safe -O1 <other llc args>. To check all debug info from a test, use ``mir-check-debugify``, like:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llc -run-pass=mir-debugify,other-pass,mir-check-debugify. To strip out all debug info from a test, use ``mir-strip-debug``, like:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llc -run-pass=mir-debugify,other-pass,mir-strip-debug. It can be useful to combine ``mir-debugify``, ``mir-check-debugify`` and/or; ``mir-strip-debug`` to identify backend transformations which break in; the presence of debug info.

Testability,"n is a typical; example.; - representing invalid node: the invalid node is preserved in the AST in some; form, e.g. when the ""declaration"" part of the declaration contains semantic; errors, the Decl node is marked as invalid.; - dropping invalid node: this often happens for errors that we don’t have; graceful recovery. Prior to Recovery AST, a mismatched-argument function call; expression was dropped though a CallExpr was created for semantic analysis. With these strategies, clang surfaces better diagnostics, and provides AST; consumers a rich AST reflecting the written source code as much as possible even; for broken code. Recovery AST; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. The idea of Recovery AST is to use recovery nodes which act as a placeholder to; maintain the rough structure of the parsing tree, preserve locations and; children but have no language semantics attached to them. For example, consider the following mismatched function call:. .. code-block:: c++. int NoArg();; void test(int abc) {; NoArg(abc); // oops, mismatched function arguments.; }. Without Recovery AST, the invalid function call expression (and its child; expressions) would be dropped in the AST:. ::. |-FunctionDecl <line:1:1, col:11> NoArg 'int ()'; `-FunctionDecl <line:2:1, line:4:1> test 'void (int)'; |-ParmVarDecl <col:11, col:15> col:15 used abc 'int'; `-CompoundStmt <col:20, line:4:1>. With Recovery AST, the AST looks like:. ::. |-FunctionDecl <line:1:1, col:11> NoArg 'int ()'; `-FunctionDecl <line:2:1, line:4:1> test 'void (int)'; |-ParmVarDecl <col:11, col:15> used abc 'int'; `-CompoundStmt <col:20, line:4:1>; `-RecoveryExpr <line:3:3, col:12> 'int' contains-errors; |-UnresolvedLookupExpr <col:3> '<overloaded function type>' lvalue (ADL) = 'NoArg'; `-DeclRefExpr <col:9> 'int' lvalue ParmVar 'abc' 'int'.

Clang can be used to compile OpenCL kernels for execution on a device; (e.g. GPU). It is possible to compile the kernel into a binary (e.g. for AMDGPU); that can be uploaded to run directly on a device (e.g. using; `clCreateProgramWithBinary; <https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/opencl-1.1.pdf#111>`_) or; into generic bitcode files loadable into other toolchains. Compiling to a binary using the default target from the installation can be done; as follows:. .. code-block:: console. $ echo ""kernel void k(){}"" > test.cl; $ clang test.cl. Compiling for a specific target can be done by specifying the triple corresponding; to the target, for example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=nvptx64-unknown-unknown test.cl; $ clang --target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -mcpu=gfx900 test.cl.

Since a node is just a; positioned volume, we can then get a pointer to the volume, medium or; material objects related to it. *Deepest* means that *B\_3* still; contains point *P* (as well as *A\_1* and *TOP\_1*), but none of the; daughters of volume **B** does. After finding out the node containing; the particle, one can check if the geometry state is different compared; to the last located point:. ``` {.cpp}; Bool_t *TGeoManager::IsSameLocation(); ```. The algorithm for finding where a point is located in geometry is; presented in the figure 17-36. It always starts by checking if the last computed modeller state is the; answer.

This is; effective even in case there is only one daughter of the current; volume.; - in case the current node is declared as possibly overlapping, the; method FindInCluster() is invoked. This method checks all different; possibilities within the cluster of overlapping candidates.

Testability,"n the assertion that the developer may know but is not immediately; apparent in the code itself. In this way assertions make implicit assumptions; explicit in the code, which not only makes the analyzer more accurate when; finding bugs, but can help others better able to understand your code as well.; It can also help remove certain kinds of analyzer false positives by pruning off; false paths.; In order to exploit assertions, however, the analyzer must understand when it; encounters an ""assertion handler."" Typically assertions are; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler. For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where the assertion condition; failed. This can lead to false positives, as the assertion condition usually; implies a safety condition (e.g., a pointer is not null) prior to performing; some action that depends on that condition (e.g., dereferencing a pointer).; The analyzer knows about several well-known assertion handlers, but can; automatically infer if a function should be treated as an assertion handler if; it is annotated with the 'noreturn' attribute or the (Clang-specific); 'analyzer_noreturn' attribute.

Testability,"n x86 processors may speculate into called functions and out of functions; to their return address. As a consequence, we need a way to check loads that; occur after a misspeculated predicate but where the load and the misspeculated; predicate are in different functions. In essence, we need some interprocedural; generalization of the predicate state tracking. A primary challenge to passing; the predicate state between functions is that we would like to not require a; change to the ABI or calling convention in order to make this mitigation more; deployable, and further would like code mitigated in this way to be easily; mixed with code not mitigated in this way and without completely losing the; value of the mitigation. ##### Embed the predicate state into the high bit(s) of the stack pointer. We can use the same technique that allows hardening pointers to pass the; predicate state into and out of functions. The stack pointer is trivially; passed between functions and we can test for it having the high bits set to; detect when it has been marked due to misspeculation. The callsite instruction; sequence looks like (assuming a misspeculated state value of `-1`):; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; shlq $47, %rax; orq %rax, %rsp; callq other_function; movq %rsp, %rax; sarq 63, %rax # Sign extend the high bit to all bits.; ```. This first puts the predicate state into the high bits of `%rsp` before calling; the function and then reads it back out of high bits of `%rsp` afterward. When; correctly executing (speculatively or not), these are all no-ops. When; misspeculating, the stack pointer will end up negative. We arrange for it to; remain a canonical address, but otherwise leave the low bits alone to allow; stack adjustments to proceed normally without disrupting this. Within the; called function, we can extract this predicate state and then reset it on; return:; ```; other_function:; # prolog; callq other_function; mov",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:38796,test,test,38796,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['test'],['test']

In the :program:`lit` model, every test must exist inside some *test suite*.; :program:`lit` resolves the inputs specified on the command line to test suites; by searching upwards from the input path until it finds a :file:`lit.cfg` or; :file:`lit.site.cfg` file. These files serve as both a marker of test suites; and as configuration files which :program:`lit` loads in order to understand; how to find and run the tests inside the test suite. Once :program:`lit` has mapped the inputs into test suites it traverses the; list of inputs adding tests for individual files and recursively searching for; tests in directories. This behavior makes it easy to specify a subset of tests to run, while still; allowing the test suite configuration to control exactly how tests are; interpreted. In addition, :program:`lit` always identifies tests by the test; suite they are in, and their relative path inside the test suite. For; appropriately configured projects, this allows :program:`lit` to provide; convenient and flexible support for out-of-tree builds. .. _test-status-results:.

To use Clang frontend's PGO instead of LLVM IR PGO, set `-DTEST_SUITE_USE_IR_PGO=OFF`. The `TEST_SUITE_RUN_TYPE` setting only affects the SPEC benchmark suites. Cross Compilation and External Devices; --------------------------------------. ### Compilation. CMake allows to cross compile to a different target via toolchain files. More; information can be found here:. - [https://llvm.org/docs/lnt/tests.html#cross-compiling](https://llvm.org/docs/lnt/tests.html#cross-compiling). - [https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html). Cross compilation from macOS to iOS is possible with the; `test-suite/cmake/caches/target-target-*-iphoneos-internal.cmake` CMake cache; files; this requires an internal iOS SDK. ### Running. There are two ways to run the tests in a cross compilation setting:. - Via SSH connection to an external device: The `TEST_SUITE_REMOTE_HOST` option; should be set to the SSH hostname. The executables and data files need to be; transferred to the device after compilation. This is typically done via the; `rsync` make target. After this, the lit runner can be used on the host; machine. It will prefix the benchmark and verification command lines with an; `ssh` command. Example:. ```bash; % cmake -G Ninja -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=path/to/clang \; -C ../test-suite/cmake/caches/target-arm64-iphoneos-internal.cmake \; -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \; -D TEST_SUITE_REMOTE_HOST=mydevice \; ../test-suite; % ninja; % ninja rsync; % llvm-lit -j1 -o result.json .; ```. - You can specify a simulator for the target machine with the; `TEST_SUITE_RUN_UNDER` setting. The lit runner will prefix all benchmark; invocations with it. Running the test-suite via LNT; ------------------------------. The LNT tool can run the test-suite.

Positional arguments are sorted by their order of construction. This means that; command line options will be ordered according to how they are listed in a .cpp; file, but will not have an ordering defined if the positional arguments are; defined in multiple .cpp files. The fix for this problem is simply to define; all of your positional arguments in one .cpp file. Specifying positional options with hyphens; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Sometimes you may want to specify a value to your positional argument that; starts with a hyphen (for example, searching for '``-foo``' in a file). At; first, you will have trouble doing this, because it will try to find an argument; named '``-foo``', and will fail (and single quotes will not save you). Note; that the system ``grep`` has the same problem:. ::. $ spiffygrep '-foo' test.txt; Unknown command line argument '-foo'. Try: spiffygrep -help'. $ grep '-foo' test.txt; grep: illegal option -- f; grep: illegal option -- o; grep: illegal option -- o; Usage: grep -hblcnsviw pattern file . . . The solution for this problem is the same for both your tool and the system; version: use the '``--``' marker.

Sometimes an option can affect or modify the meaning of another option. For; example, consider ``gcc``'s ``-x LANG`` option.

The purpose of this document; is to describe both the motivation and design goals for the driver, as; well as details of the internal implementation. Features and Goals; ==================. The Clang driver is intended to be a production quality compiler driver; providing access to the Clang compiler and tools, with a command line; interface which is compatible with the gcc driver. Although the driver is part of and driven by the Clang project, it is; logically a separate tool which shares many of the same goals as Clang:. .. contents:: Features; :local:. GCC Compatibility; -----------------. The number one goal of the driver is to ease the adoption of Clang by; allowing users to drop Clang into a build system which was designed to; call GCC. Although this makes the driver much more complicated than; might otherwise be necessary, we decided that being very compatible with; the gcc command line interface was worth it in order to allow users to; quickly test clang on their projects. Flexible; --------. The driver was designed to be flexible and easily accommodate new uses; as we grow the clang and LLVM infrastructure. As one example, the driver; can easily support the introduction of tools which have an integrated; assembler; something we hope to add to LLVM in the future. Similarly, most of the driver functionality is kept in a library which; can be used to build other tools which want to implement or accept a gcc; like interface. Low Overhead; ------------. The driver should have as little overhead as possible. In practice, we; found that the gcc driver by itself incurred a small but meaningful; overhead when compiling many small files. The driver doesn't do much; work compared to a compilation, but we have tried to keep it as; efficient as possible by following a few simple principles:. - Avoid memory allocation and string copying when possi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst:1141,test,test,1141,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DriverInternals.rst,1,['test'],['test']

If you are interested in the end-user view, please; see the :ref:`User's Manual <usersmanual-precompiled-headers>`. Using Precompiled Headers with ``clang``; ----------------------------------------. The Clang compiler frontend, ``clang -cc1``, supports two command line options; for generating and using PCH files. To generate PCH files using ``clang -cc1``, use the option `-emit-pch`:. .. code-block:: bash. $ clang -cc1 test.h -emit-pch -o test.h.pch. This option is transparently used by ``clang`` when generating PCH files. The; resulting PCH file contains the serialized form of the compiler's internal; representation after it has completed parsing and semantic analysis. The PCH; file can then be used as a prefix header with the `-include-pch`; option:. .. code-block:: bash. $ clang -cc1 -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test.s. Design Philosophy; -----------------. Precompiled headers are meant to improve overall compile times for projects, so; the design of precompiled headers is entirely driven by performance concerns.; The use case for precompiled headers is relatively simple: when there is a; common set of headers that is included in nearly every source file in the; project, we *precompile* that bundle of headers into a single precompiled; header (PCH file). Then, when compiling the source files in the project, we; load the PCH file first (as a prefix header), which acts as a stand-in for that; bundle of headers. A precompiled header implementation improves performance when:. * Loading the PCH file is significantly faster than re-parsing the bundle of; headers stored within the PCH file. Thus, a precompiled header design; attempts to minimize the cost of reading the PCH file. Ideally, this cost; should not vary with the size of the precompiled header file. * The cost of generating the PCH",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst:1078,test,test,1078,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/PCHInternals.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Some viewers can support two types of object placement:. - Add object as a single independent entity in the world reference; frame - e.g. a sphere, radius `r`, at `x`, `y`, `z`. - Repeated placement (copying) in world frame of this locally unique; piece of geometry (described in local reference frame) e.g. define a; sphere `S` (radius `r`), place copy at `x1`, `y1`, `z1`, another; copy at `x2`, `y2`, `z2` etc. The second case is very typical in geometry packages, e.g. ROOT's; **`TGeo`** package, GEANT4 etc, where we have very large number repeated; placements of relatively few unique ""shapes"". Some viewers (GL Viewer only at present) are able to take advantage of; this by identifying unique logical shapes from the `fID` logical ID; member of **`TBuffer3D`**.

Testability,"ned binary operators. This builds a lot on; the previous framework we built for other operators. Adding unary; operators is a bit more challenging, because we don't have any framework; for it yet - let's see what it takes. User-defined Unary Operators; ============================. Since we don't currently support unary operators in the Kaleidoscope; language, we'll need to add everything to support them. Above, we added; simple support for the 'unary' keyword to the lexer. In addition to; that, we need an AST node:. .. code-block:: c++. /// UnaryExprAST - Expression class for a unary operator.; class UnaryExprAST : public ExprAST {; char Opcode;; std::unique_ptr<ExprAST> Operand;. public:; UnaryExprAST(char Opcode, std::unique_ptr<ExprAST> Operand); : Opcode(Opcode), Operand(std::move(Operand)) {}. Value *codegen() override;; };. This AST node is very simple and obvious by now. It directly mirrors the; binary operator AST node, except that it only has one child. With this,; we need to add the parsing logic. Parsing a unary operator is pretty; simple: we'll add a new function to do it:. .. code-block:: c++. /// unary; /// ::= primary; /// ::= '!' unary; static std::unique_ptr<ExprAST> ParseUnary() {; // If the current token is not an operator, it must be a primary expr.; if (!isascii(CurTok) || CurTok == '(' || CurTok == ','); return ParsePrimary();. // If this is a unary operator, read it.; int Opc = CurTok;; getNextToken();; if (auto Operand = ParseUnary()); return std::make_unique<UnaryExprAST>(Opc, std::move(Operand));; return nullptr;; }. The grammar we add is pretty straightforward here. If we see a unary; operator when parsing a primary operator, we eat the operator as a; prefix and parse the remaining piece as another unary operator. This; allows us to handle multiple unary operators (e.g. ""!!x""). Note that; unary operators can't have ambiguous parses like binary operators can,; so there is no need for precedence information. The problem with this function, ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl06.rst:11116,log,logic,11116,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl06.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl06.rst,1,['log'],['logic']
Testability,"need Clang and supporting libraries, you'll want; to build the ``all`` target (e.g. ``ninja all`` or ``make -j4 all``). 2. Configure a Clang build as above, but add the following CMake args:. - ``-DLLVM_BUILD_INSTRUMENTED=IR`` -- This causes us to build everything; with instrumentation.; - ``-DLLVM_BUILD_RUNTIME=No`` -- A few projects have bad interactions when; built with profiling, and aren't necessary to build. This flag turns them; off.; - ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang`` - Use the Clang we built in; step 1.; - ``-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang++`` - Same as above. In this build directory, you simply need to build the ``clang`` target (and; whatever supporting tooling your benchmark requires). 3. As mentioned above, this has two steps: gathering profile data, and then; massaging it into a useful form:. a. Build your benchmark using the Clang generated in step 2. The 'standard'; benchmark recommended is to run ``check-clang`` and ``check-llvm`` in your; instrumented Clang's build directory, and to do a full build of Clang/LLVM; using your instrumented Clang. So, create yet another build directory,; with the following CMake arguments:. - ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/stage2/clang`` - Use the Clang we built in; step 2.; - ``-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/stage2/clang++`` - Same as above. If your users are fans of debug info, you may want to consider using; ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`` instead of; ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release``. This will grant better coverage of; debug info pieces of clang, but will take longer to complete and will; result in a much larger build directory. It's recommended to build the ``all`` target with your instrumented Clang,; since more coverage is often better. b. You should now have a few ``*.profraw`` files in; ``path/to/stage2/profiles/``. You need to merge these using; ``llvm-profdata`` (even if you only have one! The profile merge transforms; profraw into actual profile data, as well).

Testability,"nel using the program objects is executed.; In OpenCL versions earlier than v2.2 there is no support for invoking global; constructors. However, an easy workaround is to manually enqueue the; constructor initialization kernel that has the following name scheme; ``_GLOBAL__sub_I_<compiled file name>``.; This kernel is only present if there are global objects with non-trivial; constructors present in the compiled binary. One way to check this is by; passing ``CL_PROGRAM_KERNEL_NAMES`` to ``clGetProgramInfo`` (OpenCL v2.0; s5.8.7) and then checking whether any kernel name matches the naming scheme of; global constructor initialization kernel above. Note that if multiple files are compiled and linked into libraries, multiple; kernels that initialize global objects for multiple modules would have to be; invoked. Applications are currently required to run initialization of global objects; manually before running any kernels in which the objects are used. .. code-block:: console. clang -cl-std=clc++ test.cl. If there are any global objects to be initialized, the final binary will; contain the ``_GLOBAL__sub_I_test.cl`` kernel to be enqueued.

Testability,"ng qemu-arm; ===========================================; To test the builtins library we need to add a few more cmake flags to enable; testing and set up the compiler and flags for test case. We must also tell; cmake that we wish to run the tests on ``qemu-arm``. * ``-DCOMPILER_RT_EMULATOR=""qemu-arm -L /path/to/armhf/sysroot``; * ``-DCOMPILER_RT_INCLUDE_TESTS=ON``; * ``-DCOMPILER_RT_TEST_COMPILER=""/path/to/clang""``; * ``-DCOMPILER_RT_TEST_COMPILER_CFLAGS=""test-c-flags""``. The ``/path/to/armhf/sysroot`` should be the same as the one passed to; ``--sysroot`` in the ""build-c-flags"". The ""test-c-flags"" need to include the target, architecture, gcc-toolchain,; sysroot and arm/thumb state. The additional cmake defines such as; ``CMAKE_C_COMPILER_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN`` do not apply when building the tests. If; you have put all of these in ""build-c-flags"" then these can be repeated. If you; wish to use lld to link the tests then add ``""-fuse-ld=lld``. Once cmake has completed the tests can be built and run using; ``ninja check-builtins``. Troubleshooting; ===============. The cmake try compile stage fails; ---------------------------------; At an early stage cmake will attempt to compile and link a simple C program to; test if the toolchain is working. This stage can often fail at link time if the ``--sysroot=`` and; ``--gcc-toolchain=`` options are not passed to the compiler. Check the; ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS`` and ``CMAKE_C_COMPILER_TARGET`` flags. It can be useful to build a simple example outside of cmake with your toolchain; to make sure it is working. For example: ``clang --target=arm-linux-gnueabi -march=armv7a --gcc-toolchain=/path/to/gcc-toolchain --sysroot=/path/to/gcc-toolchain/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc helloworld.c``.

If you would like to stick to; particular crash, you should write check scripts to validate the error; message, see ``-compile-command`` in :doc:`CommandGuide/bugpoint`. * In the code generator and miscompilation debuggers, debugging will go faster; if you manually modify the program or its inputs to reduce the runtime, but; still exhibit the problem. * ``bugpoint`` is extremely useful when working on a new optimization: it helps; track down regressions quickly. To avoid having to relink ``bugpoint`` every; time you change your optimization however, have ``bugpoint`` dynamically load; your optimization with the ``-load`` option. * ``bugpoint`` can generate a lot of output and run for a long period of time.; It is often useful to capture the output of the program to file. For example,; in the C shell, you can run:. .. code-block:: console. $ bugpoint ... |& tee bugpoint.log. to get a copy of ``bugpoint``'s output in the file ``bugpoint.log``, as well; as on your terminal. * ``bugpoint`` cannot debug problems with the LLVM linker. If ``bugpoint``; crashes before you see its ""All input ok"" message, you might try ``llvm-link; -v`` on the same set of input files. If that also crashes, you may be; experiencing a linker bug. * ``bugpoint`` is useful for proactively finding bugs in LLVM. Invoking; ``bugpoint`` with the ``-find-bugs`` option will cause the list of specified; optimizations to be randomized and applied to the program. This process will; repeat until a bug is found or the user kills ``bugpoint``. * ``bugpoint`` can produce IR which contains long names. Run ``opt; -passes=metarenamer`` over the IR to rename everything using easy-to-read,; metasyntactic names.

Testability,"ng systems, a single user process; address space plus the kernel address space can be treated as a single address; space for symbolization purposes if desired. Dependence on Build IDs; =======================. The symbolizer markup scheme relies on contextual information about runtime; memory address layout to make it possible to convert markup elements into useful; symbolic form. This relies on having an unmistakable identification of which; binary was loaded at each address. An ELF Build ID is the payload of an ELF note with name ``""GNU""`` and type; ``NT_GNU_BUILD_ID``, a unique byte sequence that identifies a particular binary; (executable, shared library, loadable module, or driver module). The linker; generates this automatically based on a hash that includes the complete symbol; table and debugging information, even if this is later stripped from the binary. This specification uses the ELF Build ID as the sole means of identifying; binaries. Each binary relevant to the log must have been linked with a unique; Build ID. The symbolizing filter must have some means of mapping a Build ID back; to the original ELF binary (either the whole unstripped binary, or a stripped; binary paired with a separate debug file). Colorization; ============. The markup format supports a restricted subset of ANSI X3.64 SGR (Select Graphic; Rendition) control sequences. These are unlike other markup elements:. * They specify presentation details (bold or colors) rather than semantic; information. The association of semantic meaning with color (e.g. red for; errors) is chosen by the code doing the logging, rather than by the UI; presentation of the symbolizing filter. This is a concession to existing code; (e.g. LLVM sanitizer runtimes) that use specific colors and would require; substantial changes to generate semantic markup instead. * A single control sequence changes ""the state"", rather than being an; hierarchical structure that surrounds affected text.

Typically when a bug is found in LLVM, a regression test containing just; enough code to reproduce the problem should be written and placed; somewhere underneath this directory. For example, it can be a small; piece of LLVM IR distilled from an actual application or benchmark. Testing Analysis; ----------------. An analysis is a pass that infer properties on some part of the IR and not; transforming it. They are tested in general using the same infrastructure as the; regression tests, by creating a separate ""Printer"" pass to consume the analysis; result and print it on the standard output in a textual format suitable for; FileCheck.; See `llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll>`_; for an example of such test. ``test-suite``; --------------. The test suite contains whole programs, which are pieces of code which; can be compiled and linked into a stand-alone program that can be; executed. These programs are generally written in high level languages; such as C or C++. These programs are compiled using a user specified compiler and set of; flags, and then executed to capture the program output and timing; information. The output of these programs is compared to a reference; output to ensure that the program is being compiled correctly. In addition to compiling and executing programs, whole program tests; serve as a way of benchmarking LLVM performance, both in terms of the; efficiency of the programs generated as well as the speed with which; LLVM compiles, optimizes, and generates code.

To run debugging information tests simply add the ``cross-project-tests``; project to your ``LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`` define on the cmake; command-line. Regression test structure; =========================. The LLVM regression tests are driven by :program:`lit` and are located in the; ``llvm/test`` directory. This directory contains a large array of small tests that exercise; various features of LLVM and to ensure that regressions do not occur.; The directory is broken into several sub-directories, each focused on a; particular area of LLVM. Writing new regression tests; ----------------------------. The regression test structure is very simple, but does require some; information to be set. This information is gathered via ``cmake``; and is written to a file, ``test/lit.site.cfg.py`` in the build directory.; The ``llvm/test`` Makefile does this work for you. In order for the regression tests to work, each directory of tests must; have a ``lit.local.cfg`` file. :program:`lit` looks for this file to determine; how to run the tests. This file is just Python code and thus is very; flexible, but we've standardized it for the LLVM regression tests. If; you're adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from; another directory to get running. The standard ``lit.local.cfg`` simply; specifies which files to look in for tests. Any directory that contains; only directories does not need the ``lit.local.cfg`` file. Read the :doc:`Lit; documentation <CommandGuide/lit>` for more information. Each test file must contain lines starting with ""RUN:"" that tell :program:`lit`; how to run it. If there are no RUN lines, :program:`lit` will issue an error; while running a test. RUN lines are specified in the comments of the test program using the; keyword ``RUN`` followed by a colon, and lastly the command (pipeline); to e",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:7582,test,test,7582,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Bytecode Compilation; ====================. Bytecode compilation is handled in ``ByteCodeStmtGen.h`` for statements; and ``ByteCodeExprGen.h`` for expressions. The compiler has two different; backends: one to generate bytecode for functions (``ByteCodeEmitter``) and; one to directly evaluate expressions as they are compiled, without; generating bytecode (``EvalEmitter``). All functions are compiled to; bytecode, while toplevel expressions used in constant contexts are directly; evaluated since the bytecode would never be reused. This mechanism aims to; pave the way towards replacing the evaluator, improving its performance on; functions and loops, while being just as fast on single-use toplevel; expressions. The interpreter relies on stack-based, strongly-typed opcodes. The glue; logic between the code generator, along with the enumeration and; description of opcodes, can be found in ``Opcodes.td``. The opcodes are; implemented as generic template methods in ``Interp.h`` and instantiated; with the relevant primitive types by the interpreter loop or by the; evaluating emitter. Primitive Types; ---------------. * ``PT_{U|S}int{8|16|32|64}``. Signed or unsigned integers of a specific bit width, implemented using; the ```Integral``` type. * ``PT_{U|S}intFP``. Signed or unsigned integers of an arbitrary, but fixed width used to; implement integral types which are required by the target, but are not; supported by the host. Under the hood, they rely on APValue. The; ``Integral`` specialisation for these types is required by opcodes to; share an implementation with fixed integrals. * ``PT_Bool``. Representation for boolean types, essentially a 1-bit unsigned; ``Integral``. * ``PT_RealFP``. Arbitrary, but fixed precision floating point numbers.

Testability,"nguished between unsigned and signed; integer types and ran into similar issues of no-op casts. The transition from; manifesting signedness in types to instructions happened early on in LLVM's; timeline to make LLVM easier to work with. Opaque Pointers Mode; ====================. During the transition phase, LLVM can be used in two modes: In typed pointer; mode all pointer types have a pointee type and opaque pointers cannot be used.; In opaque pointers mode (the default), all pointers are opaque. The opaque; pointer mode can be disabled using ``-opaque-pointers=0`` in; LLVM tools like ``opt``, or ``-Xclang -no-opaque-pointers`` in clang.; Additionally, opaque pointer mode is automatically disabled for IR and bitcode; files that explicitly mention ``i8*`` style typed pointers. In opaque pointer mode, all typed pointers used in IR, bitcode, or created; using ``PointerType::get()`` and similar APIs are automatically converted into; opaque pointers. This simplifies migration and allows testing existing IR with; opaque pointers. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8* @test(i8* %p) {; %p2 = getelementptr i8, i8* %p, i64 1; ret i8* %p2; }. ; Is automatically converted into the following if -opaque-pointers; ; is enabled:. define ptr @test(ptr %p) {; %p2 = getelementptr i8, ptr %p, i64 1; ret ptr %p2; }. Migration Instructions; ======================. In order to support opaque pointers, two types of changes tend to be necessary.; The first is the removal of all calls to ``PointerType::getElementType()`` and; ``Type::getPointerElementType()``. In the LLVM middle-end and backend, this is usually accomplished by inspecting; the type of relevant operations instead. For example, memory access related; analyses and optimizations should use the types encoded in the load and store; instructions instead of querying the pointer type. Here are some common ways to avoid pointer element type accesses:. * For loads, use ``getType()``.; * For stores, use ``getValueOperand()->getType()``.; * U",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst:5907,test,testing,5907,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/OpaquePointers.rst,1,['test'],['testing']

Testability,"nlocalized string?; When the analyzer sees that an unlocalized string is passed to a method that will present that string to the user, it is going to produce a message similar to this one:; User-facing text should use localized string macro. If your project deliberately uses unlocalized user-facing strings (for example, in a debugging UI that is never shown to users), you can suppress the analyzer warnings (and document your intent) with a function that just returns its input but is annotated to return a localized string:. __attribute__((annotate(""returns_localized_nsstring""))); static inline NSString *LocalizationNotNeeded(NSString *s) {; return s;; }. You can then call this function when creating your debugging UI:. [field setStringValue:LocalizationNotNeeded(@""Debug"")];. Some projects may also find it useful to use NSLocalizedString but add ""DNL"" or ""Do Not Localize"" to the string contents as a convention:. UILabel *testLabel = [[UILabel alloc] init];; NSString *s = NSLocalizedString(@""Hello <Do Not Localize>"", @""For debug purposes"");; [testLabel setText:s];. Q: How do I tell the analyzer that my instance variable does not need to be released in -dealloc under Manual Retain/Release?; If your class only uses an instance variable for part of its lifetime, it may; maintain an invariant guaranteeing that the instance variable is always released; before -dealloc. In this case, you can silence a warning about a missing release; by either adding assert(_ivar == nil) or an explicit release; [_ivar release] (which will be a no-op when the variable is nil) in; -dealloc. ; Q: How do I decide whether a method's return type should be _Nullable or _Nonnull?; Depending on the implementation of the method, this puts you in one of five situations:.

Testability,"nny pointer arithmetic is involved, the alloca will not be; promoted.; #. mem2reg only works on allocas of `first; class <../../LangRef.html#first-class-types>`_ values (such as pointers,; scalars and vectors), and only if the array size of the allocation is; 1 (or missing in the .ll file). mem2reg is not capable of promoting; structs or arrays to registers. Note that the ""sroa"" pass is; more powerful and can promote structs, ""unions"", and arrays in many; cases. All of these properties are easy to satisfy for most imperative; languages, and we'll illustrate it below with Kaleidoscope. The final; question you may be asking is: should I bother with this nonsense for my; front-end? Wouldn't it be better if I just did SSA construction; directly, avoiding use of the mem2reg optimization pass? In short, we; strongly recommend that you use this technique for building SSA form,; unless there is an extremely good reason not to. Using this technique; is:. - Proven and well tested: clang uses this technique; for local mutable variables. As such, the most common clients of LLVM; are using this to handle a bulk of their variables. You can be sure; that bugs are found fast and fixed early.; - Extremely Fast: mem2reg has a number of special cases that make it; fast in common cases as well as fully general. For example, it has; fast-paths for variables that are only used in a single block,; variables that only have one assignment point, good heuristics to; avoid insertion of unneeded phi nodes, etc.; - Needed for debug info generation: `Debug information in; LLVM <../../SourceLevelDebugging.html>`_ relies on having the address of; the variable exposed so that debug info can be attached to it. This; technique dovetails very naturally with this style of debug info. If nothing else, this makes it much easier to get your front-end up and; running, and is very simple to implement.

Testability,"nodes; corresponding to the elements from the string path, as well as the; global transformation matrix for each of them. The top node corresponds; to the level 0 in the stored array, while the last node will correspond; to level `n`. For each level, the node, volume and global matrix can be; retrieved using corresponding getters:. ``` {.cpp}; TGeoHMatrix *GetMatrix(Int_t level=-1) const; TGeoNode *GetNode(Int_t level=-1) const; TGeoShape *GetShape(Int_t level=-1) const; TGeoVolume *GetVolume(Int_t level=-1) const; ```. By default the object at level n is retrieved (the align-able object). Once created, a physical node can be misaligned, meaning that its; positioning matrix or even the shape.:. ``` {.cpp}; void Align(TGeoMatrix* newmat=0, TGeoShape* newshape=0,; Bool_t check=kFALSE); ```. The convention used is that newmat represents the new local matrix of; the last node in the branch with respect to its mother volume. The; `Align()` method will actually duplicate the corresponding branch within; the logical hierarchy, creating new volumes and nodes. This is mandatory; in order to avoid problems due to replicated volumes and can create; exhaustive memory consumption if used abusively. Once aligned, a physical node is ready to be tracked. The operation can; be done only after the geometry was closed. Important NOTE: Calling the `Align()` method for a physical node changes; the node pointers for the stored node branch in the active geometry, Due; to this the other defined physical nodes containing elements of this; path will be invalid.

The idea is capture any program invariants; specified in the assertion that the developer may know but is not immediately; apparent in the code itself. In this way assertions make implicit assumptions; explicit in the code, which not only makes the analyzer more accurate when; finding bugs, but can help others better able to understand your code as well.; It can also help remove certain kinds of analyzer false positives by pruning off; false paths.; In order to exploit assertions, however, the analyzer must understand when it; encounters an ""assertion handler."" Typically assertions are; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler. For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where the assertion condition; failed. This can lead to false positives, as the assertion condition usually; implies a safety condition (e.g., a pointer is not null) prior to performing; some action that depends on that condition (e.g., dereferencing a pointer).; The analyzer knows about several well-known asse",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html:20530,assert,assert,20530,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html,1,['assert'],['assert']

During the transition phase, LLVM can be used in two modes: In typed pointer; mode all pointer types have a pointee type and opaque pointers cannot be used.; In opaque pointers mode (the default), all pointers are opaque. The opaque; pointer mode can be disabled using ``-opaque-pointers=0`` in; LLVM tools like ``opt``, or ``-Xclang -no-opaque-pointers`` in clang.; Additionally, opaque pointer mode is automatically disabled for IR and bitcode; files that explicitly mention ``i8*`` style typed pointers. In opaque pointer mode, all typed pointers used in IR, bitcode, or created; using ``PointerType::get()`` and similar APIs are automatically converted into; opaque pointers. This simplifies migration and allows testing existing IR with; opaque pointers. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8* @test(i8* %p) {; %p2 = getelementptr i8, i8* %p, i64 1; ret i8* %p2; }. ; Is automatically converted into the following if -opaque-pointers; ; is enabled:. define ptr @test(ptr %p) {; %p2 = getelementptr i8, ptr %p, i64 1; ret ptr %p2; }.

In order to support opaque pointers, two types of changes tend to be necessary.; The first is the removal of all calls to ``PointerType::getElementType()`` and; ``Type::getPointerElementType()``. In the LLVM middle-end and backend, this is usually accomplished by inspecting; the type of relevant operations instead. For example, memory access related; analyses and optimizations should use the types encoded in the load and store; instructions instead of querying the pointer type.

The physical layout changes slightly from big endian to little endian so that it matches the in-memory layout on; most modern architectures. Combined with a clear separation of offset/index data and payload data for collections,; uncompressed RNTuple data can be directly mapped to memory without further copies. Goals; -----. RNTuple shall investigate improvements of the TTree I/O in the following ways. 1. More speed; * Improve mapping to vectorized and parallel hardware; * For types known at compile / JIT time: generate optimized code; * Optimized for simple types (float, int, and vectors of them); * Better memory control: work with a fixed budget of pre-defined I/O buffers; * Naturally thread-safe and asynchronous interfaces. 2. More robust interfaces; * Compile-time type safety by default; * Decomposition into layers: logical layer, primitives layer, storage layer; * Separation of data model and live data; * Self-contained I/O code to support creation of a standalone I/O library. Concepts; --------. At the **logical layer**, the user defines a data model using the RNTupleModel class.; The data model is a collection of serializable C++ types with associated names, similar to branches in a TTree.; The data model can contain (nested) collections, e.g., a type can be `std::vector<std::vector<float>>`. Each serializable type is represented by a **field**, concretely by a templated version of RField,; e.g. `RField<double>`. A field can generate or adopt an associated **value**, which represents a memory location; storing a value of the given C++ type. These distinguished memory locations are the destinations and sources for the; deserialization and serialization. The (de-)serialization is a mapping from the C++ type to the more simple **column** type system. A column contains; an arbitrary number of fixed-sized elements of a well-defined se",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md:1326,log,logical,1326,tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/README.md,1,['log'],['logical']

Testability,"nt of how the diagnostic is formatted and in what; language it is rendered. Fix-It Hints; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. In some cases, the front end emits diagnostics when it is clear that some small; change to the source code would fix the problem. For example, a missing; semicolon at the end of a statement or a use of deprecated syntax that is; easily rewritten into a more modern form. Clang tries very hard to emit the; diagnostic and recover gracefully in these and other cases. However, for these cases where the fix is obvious, the diagnostic can be; annotated with a hint (referred to as a ""fix-it hint"") that describes how to; change the code referenced by the diagnostic to fix the problem. For example,; it might add the missing semicolon at the end of the statement or rewrite the; use of a deprecated construct into something more palatable. Here is one such; example from the C++ front end, where we warn about the right-shift operator; changing meaning from C++98 to C++11:. .. code-block:: text. test.cpp:3:7: warning: use of right-shift operator ('>>') in template argument; will require parentheses in C++11; A<100 >> 2> *a;; ^; ( ). Here, the fix-it hint is suggesting that parentheses be added, and showing; exactly where those parentheses would be inserted into the source code. The; fix-it hints themselves describe what changes to make to the source code in an; abstract manner, which the text diagnostic printer renders as a line of; ""insertions"" below the caret line. :ref:`Other diagnostic clients; <DiagnosticConsumer>` might choose to render the code differently (e.g., as; markup inline) or even give the user the ability to automatically fix the; problem. Fix-it hints on errors and warnings need to obey these rules:. * Since they are automatically applied if ``-Xclang -fixit`` is passed to the; driver, they should only be used when it's very likely they match the user's; intent.; * Clang must recover from errors as if the fix-it had been applied.; * Fix-it hints on a warning mu",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:18755,test,test,18755,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"ntegration is clear.; (Numba does not currently provide support for C++.). Usage; -------. ``cppyy`` does not use Numba extension hooks to minimize accidental; dependencies.; Instead, it requires that the extensions are loaded explicitly by any code; that uses it::. import cppyy.numba_ext. After that, Numba is able to trace ``cppyy`` bound code when applying the; usual ``numba.njit`` decorator. Numba type declarations are done lazily, with the ``numba_ext`` module only; initially registering hooks on proxy base classes, to keep overheads in; Numba's type-resolution to a minimum.; On use in a JITed trace, each C++ type or function call is refined to the; actual, concrete types and type-specific overloads, with templates; instantiated as-needed.; Where possible, lowering is kept generic to reduce the number of callbacks; in Numba's compilation chain. Examples; --------. The following, non-exhaustive, set of examples gives an idea of the; current level of support.; More examples can be found in the `test suite`_. C++ free (global) functions can be called and overloads will be selected, or; a template will be instantiated, based on the provided types.; Exact type matches are fully supported, there is some support for typedefs; add implicit conversions for builtin types, there is no support for; conversions of custom types or default arguments. - **Basic usage**: To use ``cppyy`` in Numba JITed code, simply import; ``cppyy.numba_ext``, after which further use is transparent and the same; as when otherwise using ``cppyy`` in Python.; Example:. .. code-block:: python. >>> import numba; >>> import cppyy; >>> import cppyy.numba_ext # enables numba to work with cppyy; >>> import math; >>> @numba.jit(nopython=True); ... def cpp_sqrt(x):; ... return cppyy.gbl.sqrt(x) # direct use, no extra setup required; >>> print(""Sqrt of 4: "", cpp_sqrt(4.0)); Sqrt of 4: 2.0; >>> print(""Sqrt of Pi: "", cpp_sqrt(math.pi)); Sqrt of Pi: 1.7724538509055159. - **Overload selection**: C++ overloads ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst:3171,test,test,3171,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/numba.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Q: The analyzer assumes that a loop body is never entered. How can I tell it that the loop body will be entered at least once?. In the contrived example above, the analyzer has detected that the body of; the loop is never entered for the case where length <= 0. In this; particular example, you may know that the loop will always be entered because; the input parameter length will be greater than zero in all calls to this; function. You can teach the analyzer facts about your code as well as document; it by using assertions.

The ``ScalarEvolution`` analysis can be used to analyze and categorize scalar; expressions in loops.

Simple alias analysis implemented in terms of ``ScalarEvolution`` queries. This differs from traditional loop dependence analysis in that it tests for; dependencies within a single iteration of a loop, rather than dependencies; between different iterations. ``ScalarEvolution`` has a more complete understanding of pointer arithmetic; than ``BasicAliasAnalysis``' collection of ad-hoc analyses. ``stack-safety``: Stack Safety Analysis; ---------------------------------------.

Finally, nodes can be regarded; as bi-directional links between containers and contained volumes. The structure defined in this way is a graph structure since volumes are; replicable (same volume can become daughter node of several other; volumes), every volume becoming a branch in this graph.

Testability,"nuit2 source distribution which contains all the needed files to build with [CMake]. See [DEVELOP.md] for more information about extracting the source files from [ROOT]. ## Building. To build, use the standard [CMake] procedure; on most systems, this looks like:. ```bash; mkdir PATH_TO_MINIUT2_BUILD; cd PATH_TO_MINUIT2_BUILD; cmake PATH_TO_MINUIT2_SOURCE; cmake --build .; ```. Of course, GUIs, IDEs, etc. that work with [CMake] will work with this package. The standard method of CMake building, with a build directory inside the Minuit2 source directory and using the makefile generator, would look like:. ```bash; cd PATH_TO_MINUIT2_SOURCE; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make; ```. The standard [CMake] variables, such as `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` and `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, work with Minuit2. There are two other options:. * `minuit2_mpi` activates the (outdated C++) MPI bindings.; * `minuit2_omp` activates OpenMP (make sure all FCNs are threadsafe). ## Testing. You can run `ctest` or `make test` to run the Minuit2 test suite. ## Installing or using in another package. You can install the package using `cmake --build --target install .` (or `make install` if directly using the make system), or you can use it from the build directory. You can also include it in another CMake project using `add_subdirectory()` and linking to the `Minuit2` target. Since this package also exports targets, `find_package(Minuit2)` will also work once this package is built or installed. (For the curious, CMake adds a config script to `~/.cmake/packages` when building or; `$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share/cmake/Modules` when installing a package that has export commands.). To repeat; using this in your own CMake project usually amounts to:. ```cmake; find_package(Minuit2); # OR; add_subdirectory(Minuit2). target_link_libraries(MyExeOrLib PUBLIC Minuit2::Minuit2); ```. You do not need to add include directories or anything else for Minuit2; the CMake target system handles all of this for you. ## Packaging",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/minuit2/README.md:1372,test,test,1372,math/minuit2/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/minuit2/README.md,2,['test'],['test']

This script also supports a ``--dry-run`` option, which causes it to print; important commands instead of running them. Selecting 'benchmarks'; ======================. PGO does best when the profiles gathered represent how the user plans to use the; compiler. Notably, highly accurate profiles of llc building x86_64 code aren't; incredibly helpful if you're going to be targeting ARM. By default, the script above does two things to get solid coverage. It:. - runs all of Clang and LLVM's lit tests, and; - uses the instrumented Clang to build Clang, LLVM, and all of the other; LLVM subprojects available to it. Together, these should give you:. - solid coverage of building C++,; - good coverage of building C,; - great coverage of running optimizations,; - great coverage of the backend for your host's architecture, and; - some coverage of other architectures (if other arches are supported backends). Altogether, this should cover a diverse set of uses for Clang and LLVM. If you; have very specific needs (e.g. your compiler is meant to compile a large browser; for four different platforms, or similar), you may want to do something else.; This is configurable in the script itself. Building Clang with PGO; =======================. If you prefer to not use the script or the cmake cache, this briefly goes over; how to build Clang/LLVM with PGO.

Clang also supports profiling via instrumentation. This requires building a; special instrumented version of the code and has some runtime; overhead during the profiling, but it provides more detailed results than a; sampling profiler. It also provides reproducible results, at least to the; extent that the code behaves consistently across runs. Clang supports two types of instrumentation: frontend-based and IR-based.; Frontend-based instrumentation can be enabled with the option ``-fprofile-instr-generate``,; and IR-based instrumentation can be enabled with the option ``-fprofile-generate``.; For best performance with PGO, IR-based instrumentation should be used. It has; the benefits of lower instrumentation overhead, smaller raw profile size, and; better runtime performance. Frontend-based instrumentation, on the other hand,; has better source correlation, so it should be used with source line-based; coverage testing. The flag ``-fcs-profile-generate`` also instruments programs using the same; instrumentation method as ``-fprofile-generate``. However, it performs a; post-inline late instrumentation and can produce context-sensitive profiles. Here are the steps for using profile guided optimization with; instrumentation:. 1.

The computation may be more efficient than running the `RDataFrame`s sequentially if an analysis consists of several computation graphs that individually do not fully utilize the available resources.

The first version of this redesign would try to:. * Discard functions, instructions and metadata that don’t influence the; interesting-ness test; * Remove unused parameters from functions; * Eliminate unvisited conditional paths; * Rename variables to more regular ones (such as “a”, “b”, “c”, etc.). Once these passes are implemented, more meaningful reductions (such as type; reduction) would be added to the tool, to even further reduce IR. ## Background on historical bugpoint issues. ### Root Cause Anal",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BugpointRedesign.md:1965,test,test,1965,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BugpointRedesign.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BugpointRedesign.md,2,['test'],['test']

This entire feature is driven; by relation models which can be defined in ``XXXInstrInfo.td`` files; according to the target-specific instruction set. Relation models are defined; using ``InstrMapping`` class as a base. TableGen parses all the models; and generates instruction relation maps using the specified information.; Relation maps are emitted as tables in the ``XXXGenInstrInfo.inc`` file; along with the functions to query them.

The test succeeded after being re-run more than once. This only applies to; tests containing an ``ALLOW_RETRIES:`` annotation. **XFAIL**. The test failed, but that is expected. This is used for test formats which allow; specifying that a test does not currently work, but wish to leave it in the test; suite. **XPASS**. The test succeeded, but it was expected to fail.

The test failed. **UNRESOLVED**. The test result could not be determined.

This can be done like so:. ~~~ {.cpp}; ./configure --enable-gdml; ~~~. On doing this the libraries will be built by issuing the standard ROOT; make command. The GDML to TGeo converter uses the TXMLEngine to parse; the GDML files. This XML parser is a DOM parser and returns the DOM; tree to the class TGDMLParse. This class then interprets the GDML file; and adds the bindings in their TGeo equivalent. The GDML schema is fully supported with a few exceptions:. - Replica Volumes are not supported; - Loops are not supported; - Matrices are not supported. These will hopefully be added in the near future. Once you have enabled GDML in the configure process for ROOT, to import; a GDML file, this can be done using TGeoManager::Import. This automatically; calls the right method to parse the GDML by detecting the .gdml file; extension. Here is how to do it:. ~~~ {.cpp}; TGeoManager::Import(""test.gdml"");; ~~~. Replace test.gdml with the gdml filename you want to import.

Then in VisitDeclStmt(), we compute the; corresponding lazy compound value if the variable is not a reference, and; bind the variable region to the lazy compound value.

In ctors, we synthesize 'this' region with; CXXRecordDecl*, which means we do not use type qualifiers. In methods, we; synthesize 'this' region with CXXMethodDecl*, which has getThisType(); taking type qualifiers into account.

In the same way, when a **`TRef::GetObject`**; is called, `GetObject` uses its own `fUniqueID` to find the pointer to; the referenced object. See `TProcessID::GetObjectWithID` and; `PutObjectWithID`. #### Object Number. When an object is referenced, a unique identifier is computed and stored; in both the `fUniqueID` of the referenced and referencing object. This; `uniqueID` is computed by incrementing by one the static global in; `TProcessID::fgNumber`. The `fUniqueID` is the serial object number in; the current session. One can retrieve the current `fgNumber` value by; calling the static function `TProcessID::GetObjectCount` at any time or; can set this number by **`TProcessID::SetObjectCount`**. To avoid a; growing table of `fObjects` in `TProcessID`, in case, for example, one; processes many events in a loop, it might be necessary to reset the; object number at the end of processing of one event. See an example in; `$ROOTSYS/test/Event.cxx` (look at function `Build`). The value of; `ObjectNumber `may be saved at the beginning of one event and reset to; this original value at the end of the event.

Testability,"o this, the CompileOnDemandLayer creates two small; utilities for each function that it scans: a *stub* and a *compile; callback*. The stub is a pair of a function pointer (which will be pointed at; the function's implementation once the function has been compiled) and an; indirect jump through the pointer. By fixing the address of the indirect jump; for the lifetime of the program we can give the function a permanent ""effective; address"", one that can be safely used for indirection and function pointer; comparison even if the function's implementation is never compiled, or if it is; compiled more than once (due to, for example, recompiling the function at a; higher optimization level) and changes address. The second utility, the compile; callback, represents a re-entry point from the program into the compiler that; will trigger compilation and then execution of a function. By initializing the; function's stub to point at the function's compile callback, we enable lazy; compilation: The first attempted call to the function will follow the function; pointer and trigger the compile callback instead. The compile callback will; compile the function, update the function pointer for the stub, then execute; the function. On all subsequent calls to the function, the function pointer; will point at the already-compiled function, so there is no further overhead; from the compiler. We will look at this process in more detail in the next; chapter of this tutorial, but for now we'll trust the CompileOnDemandLayer to; set all the stubs and callbacks up for us. All we need to do is to add the; CompileOnDemandLayer to the top of our stack and we'll get the benefits of; lazy compilation.

Testability,"o, suppose; you have an existing canvas with several pads. You create a new pad; (transparent) covering for example the entire canvas. Then you draw your; primitives in this pad. The same can be achieved with the graphics; editor. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .x tutorials/hist/h1draw.C; root[] TPad *newpad=new TPad(""newpad"",""Transparent pad"",0,0,1,1);; root[] newpad->SetFillStyle(4000);; root[] newpad->Draw();; root[] newpad->cd();; root[] // create some primitives, etc; ```. ### Setting the Log Scale. Setting the scale to logarithmic or linear is an attribute of the pad,; not the axis or the histogram. The scale is an attribute of the pad; because you may want to draw the same histogram in linear scale in one; pad and in log scale in another pad. Frequently, we see several; histograms on top of each other in the same pad. It would be very; inconvenient to set the scale attribute for each histogram in a pad. Furthermore, if the logic was set in the histogram class (or each; object) the scale setting in each `Paint` method of all objects should; be tested. If you have a pad with a histogram, a right-click on the pad, outside of; the histograms frame will convince you. The `SetLogx()`, `SetLogy()` and; `SetLogz()` methods are there. As you see, **`TPad`** defines log scale; for the two directions `x` and `y` plus `z` if you want to draw a 3D; representation of some function or histogram. The way to set log scale in the x direction for the active pad is:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gPad->SetLogx(1); ```. To reset log in the z direction:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] gPad->SetLogz(0); ```. If you have a divided pad, you need to set the scale on each of the; sub-pads. Setting it on the containing pad does not automatically; propagate to the sub-pads. Here is an example of how to set the log; scale for the x-axis on a canvas with four sub-pads:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TCanvas MyCanvas(""MyCanvas"",""My Canvas""); root[] MyCanvas->Divide(2,2); root[] MyCanvas->cd(1); root[] gPad->SetLogx(); roo",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md:29555,log,logic,29555,documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,2,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'tested']"

On; start-up, ROOT parses all files ending on `.rootmap` rootmap that are; in one of the `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or `$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` for `MacOS`,; or `$PATH` for `Windows`). They contain class names and the library; names that the class depends on. After reading them, ROOT knows which; classes are available, and which libraries to load for them. When `TSystem::Load(""ALib"")` is called, ROOT uses this information to; determine which libraries `libALib.so` depends on. It will load these; libraries first. Otherwise, loading the requested library could cause; a system (dynamic loader) error due to unresolved symbols. ### \$ROOTSYS/tutorials. tutorials The tutorials directory contains many example example; scripts.

The program stress takes one argument, the number of events to process.; The default is 1000 events. Be aware that executing stress with 1000; events*will create several files consuming about 100 MB of disk space;*; running stress with 30 events will consume about 20 MB. The disk space; is released once stress is done. There are two ways to run `stress`:. From the system prompt or from the ROOT prompt using the interpreter. ``` {.cpp}; > cd $ROOTSYS/test; > stress // default 1000 events; > stress 30 // test with 30 events; ```. Start ROOT with the batch mode option (-b) to suppress the graphic; output. ``` {.cpp}; > root -b; root[] .L stress.cxx; root[] stress(1000)// test with 1000 events; root[] stress(30)// test with 30 events; ```. The output of stress includes a pass/fail conclusion for each test, the; total number of bytes read and written, and the elapsed real and CPU; time.

Feature Test Macros; ===================; Clang implements several ways to test whether a feature is supported or not.; Some of these feature tests are standardized, like ``__has_cpp_attribute`` or; ``__cpp_lambdas``, while others are Clang extensions, like ``__has_builtin``.; The common theme among all the various feature tests is that they are a utility; to tell users that we think a particular feature is complete. However,; completeness is a difficult property to define because features may still have; lingering bugs, may only work on some targets, etc. We use the following; criteria when deciding whether to expose a feature test macro (or particular; result value for the feature test):. * Are there known issues where we reject valid code that should be accepted?; * Are there known issues where we accept invalid code that should be rejected?; * Are there known crashes, failed assertions, or miscompilations?; * Are there known issues on a particular relevant target?. If the answer to any of these is ""yes"", the feature test macro should either; not be defined or there should be very strong rationale for why the issues; should not prevent defining it. Note, it is acceptable to define the feature; test macro on a per-target basis if needed. When in doubt, being conservative is better than being aggressive.

Cross compilation from macOS to iOS is possible with the; `test-suite/cmake/caches/target-target-*-iphoneos-internal.cmake` CMake cache; files; this requires an internal iOS SDK. ### Running. There are two ways to run the tests in a cross compilation setting:. - Via SSH connection to an external device: The `TEST_SUITE_REMOTE_HOST` option; should be set to the SSH hostname. The executables and data files need to be; transferred to the device after compilation. This is typically done via the; `rsync` make target. After this, the lit runner can be used on the host; machine. It will prefix the benchmark and verification command lines with an; `ssh` command. Example:. ```bash; % cmake -G Ninja -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=path/to/clang \; -C ../test-suite/cmake/caches/target-arm64-iphoneos-internal.cmake \; -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \; -D TEST_SUITE_REMOTE_HOST=mydevice \; ../test-suite; % ninja; % ninja rsync; % llvm-lit -j1 -o result.json .; ```. - You can specify a simulator for the target machine with the; `TEST_SUITE_RUN_UNDER` setting. The lit runner will prefix all benchmark; invocations with it. Running the test-suite via LNT; ------------------------------. The LNT tool can run the test-suite. Use this when submitting test results to; an LNT instance. See; [https://llvm.org/docs/lnt/tests.html#llvm-cmake-test-suite](https://llvm.org/docs/lnt/tests.html#llvm-cmake-test-suite); for details.

The build target ``check-all`` must pass with the; new target built, and where applicable, the ``test-suite`` must also; pass without errors, in at least one configuration (publicly; demonstrated, for example, via buildbots). * Public buildbots need to be created and actively maintained, unless; the target requires no additional buildbots (ex. ``check-all`` covers; all tests). The more relevant and public the new target's CI infrastructure; is, the more the LLVM community will embrace it. To **continue** as a supported and official target:. * The maintainer(s) must continue following these rules throughout the lifetime; of the target. Continuous violations of aforementioned rules and policies; could lead to complete removal of the target from the code base. * Degradation in support, documentation or test coverage will make the target as; nuisance to other targets and be considered a candidate for deprecation and; ultimately removed.

Some regression test cases are very large and complex to write/update by hand.; In that case to reduce the human work we can use the scripts available in; llvm/utils/ to generate the assertions. For example to generate assertions in an :program:`llc`-based test, after; adding one or more RUN lines use:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc test.ll. This will generate FileCheck assertions, and insert a ``NOTE:`` line at the; top to indicate that assertions were automatically generated. If you want to update assertions in an existing test case, pass the `-u` option; which first checks the ``NOTE:`` line exists and matches the script name. Sometimes a test absolutely depends on hand-written assertions and should not; have assertions automatically generated. In that case, add the text ``NOTE: Do; not autogenerate`` to the first line, and the scripts will skip that test. It; is a good idea to explain why generated assertions will not work for the test; so future developers will understand what is going on. These are the most common scripts and their purposes/applications in generating; assertions:. .. code-block:: none. update_analyze_test_checks.py; opt -passes='print<cost-model>'. update_cc_test_checks.py; C/C++, or clang/clang++ (IR checks). update_llc_test_checks.py; llc (assembly checks). update_mca_test_checks.py; llvm-mca. update_mir_test_checks.py; llc (MIR checks). update_test_checks.py; opt.

Testability,"ode to be compiled is large, and; may also do a lot of unnecessary compilation if only a few compiled functions; are ever called at runtime. A truly ""just-in-time"" compiler should allow us to; defer the compilation of any given function until the moment that function is; first called, improving launch times and eliminating redundant work. In fact,; the ORC APIs provide us with a layer to lazily compile LLVM IR:; *CompileOnDemandLayer*. The CompileOnDemandLayer class conforms to the layer interface described in; Chapter 2, but its addModule method behaves quite differently from the layers; we have seen so far: rather than doing any work up front, it just scans the; Modules being added and arranges for each function in them to be compiled the; first time it is called. To do this, the CompileOnDemandLayer creates two small; utilities for each function that it scans: a *stub* and a *compile; callback*. The stub is a pair of a function pointer (which will be pointed at; the function's implementation once the function has been compiled) and an; indirect jump through the pointer. By fixing the address of the indirect jump; for the lifetime of the program we can give the function a permanent ""effective; address"", one that can be safely used for indirection and function pointer; comparison even if the function's implementation is never compiled, or if it is; compiled more than once (due to, for example, recompiling the function at a; higher optimization level) and changes address. The second utility, the compile; callback, represents a re-entry point from the program into the compiler that; will trigger compilation and then execution of a function. By initializing the; function's stub to point at the function's compile callback, we enable lazy; compilation: The first attempted call to the function will follow the function; pointer and trigger the compile callback instead. The compile callback will; compile the function, update the function pointer for the stub, then execute;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT3.rst:2203,stub,stub,2203,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT3.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT3.rst,1,['stub'],['stub']

Testability,"oesn't need to handle any; predefined operators. Kicking the Tires; =================. It is somewhat hard to believe, but with a few simple extensions we've; covered in the last chapters, we have grown a real-ish language. With; this, we can do a lot of interesting things, including I/O, math, and a; bunch of other things. For example, we can now add a nice sequencing; operator (printd is defined to print out the specified value and a; newline):. ::. ready> extern printd(x);; Read extern:; declare double @printd(double). ready> def binary : 1 (x y) 0; # Low-precedence operator that ignores operands.; ...; ready> printd(123) : printd(456) : printd(789);; 123.000000; 456.000000; 789.000000; Evaluated to 0.000000. We can also define a bunch of other ""primitive"" operations, such as:. ::. # Logical unary not.; def unary!(v); if v then; 0; else; 1;. # Unary negate.; def unary-(v); 0-v;. # Define > with the same precedence as <.; def binary> 10 (LHS RHS); RHS < LHS;. # Binary logical or, which does not short circuit.; def binary| 5 (LHS RHS); if LHS then; 1; else if RHS then; 1; else; 0;. # Binary logical and, which does not short circuit.; def binary& 6 (LHS RHS); if !LHS then; 0; else; !!RHS;. # Define = with slightly lower precedence than relationals.; def binary = 9 (LHS RHS); !(LHS < RHS | LHS > RHS);. # Define ':' for sequencing: as a low-precedence operator that ignores operands; # and just returns the RHS.; def binary : 1 (x y) y;. Given the previous if/then/else support, we can also define interesting; functions for I/O. For example, the following prints out a character; whose ""density"" reflects the value passed in: the lower the value, the; denser the character:. ::. ready> extern putchard(char);; ...; ready> def printdensity(d); if d > 8 then; putchard(32) # ' '; else if d > 4 then; putchard(46) # '.'; else if d > 2 then; putchard(43) # '+'; else; putchard(42); # '*'; ...; ready> printdensity(1): printdensity(2): printdensity(3):; printdensity(4): printdensity(5",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl06.rst:15267,log,logical,15267,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl06.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl06.rst,1,['log'],['logical']

Testability,"of the approach is that it is common for; the same (and often large) header files to be included by multiple; source files. Consequently, compile times can often be greatly improved; by caching some of the (redundant) work done by a compiler to process; headers. Precompiled header files, which represent one of many ways to; implement this optimization, are literally files that represent an; on-disk cache that contains the vital information necessary to reduce; some of the work needed to process a corresponding header file. While; details of precompiled headers vary between compilers, precompiled; headers have been shown to be highly effective at speeding up program; compilation on systems with very large system headers (e.g., macOS). Generating a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. To generate a PCH file using Clang, one invokes Clang with the; `-x <language>-header` option. This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch. Using a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A PCH file can then be used as a prefix header when a ``-include-pch``; option is passed to ``clang``:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test. The ``clang`` driver will check if the PCH file ``test.h.pch`` is; available; if so, the contents of ``test.h`` (and the files it includes); will be processed from the PCH file. Otherwise, Clang will report an error. .. note::. Clang does *not* automatically use PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``.

Testing Format; ==============. .. warning::; This section is for the LLVM developers who are working on ``llvm-cov`` only. ``llvm-cov`` uses a special file format (called ``.covmapping`` below) for; testing purposes. This format is private and should have no use for general; users. As a developer, you can get such files by the ``convert-for-testing``; subcommand of ``llvm-cov``. The structure of the ``.covmapping`` files follows:. ``[magicNumber : u64, version : u64, profileNames, coverageMapping, coverageRecords]``. Magic Number and Version; ------------------------. The magic is ``0x6d766f636d766c6c``, which is the ASCII string; ``llvmcovm`` in little-endian. There are two versions for now:. - Version1, encoded as ``0x6174616474736574`` (ASCII string ``testdata``).; - Version2, encoded as 1. The only difference between Version1 and Version2 is in the encoding of the; ``coverageMapping`` fields, which is explained later. Profile Names; -------------. ``profileNames``, ``coverageMapping`` and ``coverageRecords`` are 3 sections; extracted from the original binary file. ``profileNames`` encodes the size, address and the raw data of the section:. ``[profileNamesSize : LEB128, profileNamesAddr : LEB128, profileNamesData : bytes]``. Coverage Mapping; ----------------. This field is padded with zero bytes to make it 8-byte aligned. ``coverageMapping`` contains the records of the source files. In version 1,; only one record is stored:. ``[padding : bytes, coverageMappingData : bytes]``. Version 2 relaxes this restriction by encoding the size of; ``coverageMappingData`` as a LEB128 number before the data:. ``[coverageMappingSize : LEB128, padding : bytes, coverageMappingData : bytes]``.

The core tier is composed of:; * Core code (``llvm-project``) present in official releases and buildbots:; compiler, debugger, linker, libraries, etc, including infrastructure code; (table-gen, lit, file-check, unit-tests, etc).; * Build infrastructure that creates releases and buildbots (CMake, scripts).; * `Phabricator <https://github.com/llvm/phabricator>`_ and; `buildbot <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-zorg>`_ infrastructure.; * The `test-suite <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite>`_. Requirements; ------------. Code in this tier must:; * Keep official buildbots green, with warnings on breakages being emailed to; all affected developers. Those must be fixed as soon as possible or patches; must be reverted, as per review policy.; * Bit-rot of a component in the core tier will result in that component being; downgraded to the peripheral tier or being removed. Sub-communities can; avoid this by fixing all raised issues in a timely manner. Peripheral Tier; ===============. The peripheral tier encompass the parts of LLVM that cater to a specific; sub-community and which don't usually affect the core components directly. This includes experimental back-ends, disabled-by-default options and; alternative paths (work-in-progress replacements) in the same repository, as; well as separate efforts to integrate LLVM development with local practices. It is the responsibility of each sub-community to care about their own parts; and the intersection of that with the ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportPolicy.rst:2661,test,test-suite,2661,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportPolicy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportPolicy.rst,1,['test'],['test-suite']
Testability,"of the tools you'll need are :doc:`here <GettingStarted>`. Release Qualification Criteria; ------------------------------. There are no official release qualification criteria. It is up to the; the release manager to determine when a release is ready. The release manager; should pay attention to the results of community testing, the number of outstanding; bugs, and then number of regressions when determining whether or not to make a; release. The community values time based releases, so releases should not be delayed for; too long unless there are critical issues remaining. In most cases, the only; kind of bugs that are critical enough to block a release would be a major regression; from a previous release. Official Testing; ----------------. A few developers in the community have dedicated time to validate the release; candidates and volunteered to be the official release testers for each; architecture. These will be the ones testing, generating and uploading the official binaries; to the server, and will be the minimum tests *necessary* for the release to; proceed. This will obviously not cover all OSs and distributions, so additional community; validation is important. However, if community input is not reached before the; release is out, all bugs reported will have to go on the next stable release. The official release managers are:. * Even releases: Tom Stellard (tstellar@redhat.com); * Odd releases: Tobias Hieta (tobias@hieta.se). The official release testers are volunteered from the community and have; consistently validated and released binaries for their targets/OSs. To contact; them, you should post on the `Discourse forums (Project; Infrastructure - Release Testers). <https://discourse.llvm.org/c/infrastructure/release-testers/66>`_. The official testers list is in the file ``RELEASE_TESTERS.TXT``, in the ``LLVM``; repository. Community Testing; -----------------.

DESCRIPTION; -----------; :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer` parses debug and text sections in; binary object files and prints their contents in a logical view, which; is a human readable representation that closely matches the structure; of the original user source code. Supported object file formats include; ELF, Mach-O, PDB and COFF. The **logical view** abstracts the complexity associated with the; different low-level representations of the debugging information that; is embedded in the object file. :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer`; produces a canonical view of the debug information regardless of how it; is formatted. The same logical view will be seen regardless of object; file format, assuming the debug information correctly represents the; same original source code. The logical view includes the following **logical elements**: *type*,; *scope*, *symbol* and *line*, which are the basic software elements used; in the C/C++ programming language. Each logical element has a set of; **attributes**, such as *types*, *classes*, *functions*, *variables*,; *parameters*, etc. The :option:`--attribute` can be used to specify which; attributes to include when printing a logical element. A logical element; may have a **kind** that describes specific types of elements. For; instance, a *scope* could have a kind value of *function*, *class*,; *namespace*. :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer` defaults to print a pre-defined; layout of logical elements and attributes.

The number of possible different states of; the modeller corresponds to the number of different objects/paths in; the geometry. This has nothing to do with the number of nodes, since; the same node can be found on different branches. In other words,; the number of states corresponds to the number of nodes in the; `expanded geometry tree`. Since unfortunately this expansion from; logical to physical hierarchy cannot be stored on regular basis due; to the large size of the latter, one cannot directly assign state; numbers. If the size of the expansion proves however to be small; enough (less than about 50 million objects), a parallel structure; storing these state indices is built and stored in memory. In such; case each state automatically gets an index that can be retrieved; after any state initialization. These indices can prove to be quite; useful for being able to keep track of the navigation history and; force certain states. Let's illustrate how this works with a simple; example:; - Suppose we have a simple geometry with a volume B positioned twice; inside a container A. Then A is positioned twice in a top container; T. The complete list of logical nodes is: `T_1`, `A_1`, `A_2`,; `B_1`, `B_2`.

An OpenCL implementation provides a list of standard address spaces using; keywords: ``private``, ``local``, ``global``, and ``generic``. In the AST and; in the IR each of the address spaces will be represented by unique number; provided in the Clang source code. The specific IDs for an address space do not; have to match between the AST and the IR. Typically in the AST address space; numbers represent logical segments while in the IR they represent physical; segments.; Therefore, machines with flat memory segments can map all AST address space; numbers to the same physical segment ID or skip address space attribute; completely while generating the IR. However, if the address space information; is needed by the IR passes e.g. to improve alias analysis, it is recommended; to keep it and only lower to reflect physical memory segments in the late; machine passes.

Testability,"ompiler can guarantee that it always sees just the already-parsed definition from the module. While building a module, ``#include_next`` is also supported, with one caveat.; The usual behavior of ``#include_next`` is to search for the specified filename; in the list of include paths, starting from the path *after* the one; in which the current file was found.; Because files listed in module maps are not found through include paths, a; different strategy is used for ``#include_next`` directives in such files: the; list of include paths is searched for the specified header name, to find the; first include path that would refer to the current file. ``#include_next`` is; interpreted as if the current file had been found in that path.; If this search finds a file named by a module map, the ``#include_next``; directive is translated into an import, just like for a ``#include``; directive.``. Module maps; -----------; The crucial link between modules and headers is described by a *module map*, which describes how a collection of existing headers maps on to the (logical) structure of a module. For example, one could imagine a module ``std`` covering the C standard library. Each of the C standard library headers (``<stdio.h>``, ``<stdlib.h>``, ``<math.h>``, etc.) would contribute to the ``std`` module, by placing their respective APIs into the corresponding submodule (``std.io``, ``std.lib``, ``std.math``, etc.). Having a list of the headers that are part of the ``std`` module allows the compiler to build the ``std`` module as a standalone entity, and having the mapping from header names to (sub)modules allows the automatic translation of ``#include`` directives to module imports. Module maps are specified as separate files (each named ``module.modulemap``) alongside the headers they describe, which allows them to be added to existing software libraries without having to change the library headers themselves (in most cases [#]_). The actual `Module map language`_ is describe",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:11598,log,logical,11598,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,1,['log'],['logical']

So that; they have no effect on other test files, these directives modify a copy of the; substitution list that is produced by lit configuration files. For example, the following directives can be inserted into a test file to define; ``%{cflags}`` and ``%{fcflags}`` substitutions with empty initial values, which; serve as the parameters of another newly defined ``%{check}`` substitution:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; DEFINE: %{cflags} =; ; DEFINE: %{fcflags} =. ; DEFINE: %{check} = \; ; DEFINE: %clang_cc1 -verify -fopenmp -fopenmp-version=51 %{cflags} \; ; DEFINE: -emit-llvm -o - %s | \; ; DEFINE: FileCheck %{fcflags} %s.

This comparison has been implemented in initial *MergeFunctions* pass; version. But, unfortunately, it is not transitive. And this is the only case; we can't convert to less-equal-greater comparison. It is a seldom case, 4-5; functions of 10000 (checked in test-suite), and, we hope, the reader would; forgive us for such a sacrifice in order to get the O(log(N)) pass time. 2. If left/right *Value* is a constant, we have to compare them. Return 0 if it; is the same constant, or use ``cmpConstants`` method otherwise. 3. If left/right is *InlineAsm* instance. Return result of *Value* pointers; comparison. 4. Explicit association of *L* (left value) and *R* (right value). We need to; find out whether values met at the same time, and thus are *associated*. Or we; need to put the rule: when we treat *L* < *R*. Now it is easy: we just return; the result of numbers comparison:. .. code-block:: c++. std::pair<iterator, bool>; LeftRes = sn_mapL.insert(std::make_pair(Left, sn_mapL.size())),; RightRes = sn_mapR.insert(std::make_pair(Right, sn_mapR.size()));; if (LeftRes.first->second == RightRes.first->second) return 0;; if (LeftRes.first->second < RightRes.first->second) return -1;; return 1;.

However, this design requires a separate logic to walk through the; entire type hierarchy to check type compatibility of bounds annotations. Late parsing for C; ==================. A bounds annotation such as ``__counted_by(count)`` can be added to type of a; struct field declaration where count is another field of the same struct; declared later. Similarly, the annotation may apply to type of a function; parameter declaration which precedes the parameter count in the same function.; This means parsing the argument of bounds annotations must be done after the; parser has the whole context of a struct or a function declaration.

For instance,; a pointer dereference on a ``__bidi_indexable`` pointer will return the; dereferenced value same as plain C pointers, modulo the extra bounds checks; being performed before dereferencing the wide pointer. This means mapping the; wide pointers to struct types with equivalent layout won’t be sufficient. To; represent the wide pointers in Clang AST, we add an extra field in the; PointerType class to indicate the internal bounds of the pointer.

Testability,"onstructs the proper likelihood, built; up from the available `RooAbsL` subclasses. The new classes are not per se meant to be used outside of `RooMinimizer`, although they can be.; The main reason is that they do not behave as regular `RooAbsReal` objects, but have their own interface which was kept to the minimum necessary for interacting with `RooMinimizer` as an object that encodes purely the statistics concepts.; However, we do provide the `RooRealL` class, which holds a `RooAbsL` object, but does inherit from `RooAbsReal` as well, so that it can be used in contexts where you would normally use a `RooAbsReal` (like for plotting). ### Usage example: Create an unbinned likelihood object; It is possible to directly create `RooAbsL` based likelihood objects from a pdf and dataset, in this example a `RooUnbinnedL` type:; ``` {.cpp}; RooAbsPdf *pdf;; RooDataSet *data;; std::tie(pdf, data) = generate_some_unbinned_pdf_and_dataset(with, some, parameters);. RooFit::TestStatistics::RooUnbinnedL likelihood(pdf, data);; ```. However, most of the time, the user will not need **or want** such direct control over the type, but rather just let RooFit figure out what exact likelihood type (`RooAbsL` derived class) is best.; For this situation, the `buildLikelihood` function was created that can be used (for instance) as:; ``` {.cpp}; std::shared_ptr<RooFit::TestStatistics::RooAbsL> likelihood = RooFit::TestStatistics::buildLikelihood(pdf, data);; ```; `buildLikelihood` actually returns a `unique_ptr`; storing the result in a `shared_ptr` as done here is just one possible use-case. ### Usage example: Create a likelihood of a simultaneous PDF with constraint terms and global observables (and other optional arguments); The `RooAbsPdf::fitTo` or `RooAbsPdf::createNLL` interfaces could take in a set of optional parameters as `RooCmdArg` objects.; In `TestStatistics::buildLikelihood`, we have implemented 4 of these options as separate types while an additional one is supported as a s",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md:2687,Test,TestStatistics,2687,roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md,1,['Test'],['TestStatistics']

The current implementation of `RVec` is based on LLVM's SmallVector, extracted; from the head of LLVM's repo around December 2020.; We are not tracking the upstream implementation. Compared to LLVM's SmallVectors:. - memory adoption capabilities have been added; - patches have been applied to make RVec work with (ROOT's version of) cppyy (notably `using` declarations had to be; lowered in the inheritance hierarchy for cppyy to pick them up); - `operator[](mask)` has been added, as well as several other ""numpy-like"" helper; functions (these latter ones are free functions); - logical operators `==`, `<`, `>` etc. return vectors rather than booleans; - the type of fSize and fCapacity is signed rather than unsigned, and fixed to 32 bits; - a number of minor patches have been applied for backward compatibility with the previous; implementation of RVec (which did not have a small buffer optimization and was implemented; in terms of `std::vector` with a custom allocator) and to make the code more consistent; with ROOT's coding conventions. ## RVec design. `SmallVectorBase`; - `fBeginX`; - `fSize`; - `fCapacity`.

Regression tests; ----------------. The regression tests are small pieces of code that test a specific; feature of LLVM or trigger a specific bug in LLVM. The language they are; written in depends on the part of LLVM being tested. These tests are driven by; the :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool (which is part of LLVM), and; are located in the ``llvm/test`` directory. Typically when a bug is found in LLVM, a regression test containing just; enough code to reproduce the problem should be written and placed; somewhere underneath this directory. For example, it can be a small; piece of LLVM IR distilled from an actual application or benchmark. Testing Analysis; ----------------. An analysis is a pass that infer properties on some part of the IR and not; transforming it. They are tested in general using the same infrastructure as the; regression tests, by creating a separate ""Printer"" pass to consume the analysis; result and print it on the standard output in a textual format suitable for; FileCheck.; See `llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/test/Analysis/BranchProbabilityInfo/loop.ll>`_; for an example of such test. ``test-suite``; --------------. The test suite contains whole programs, which are pieces of code which; can be compiled and linked into a stand-alone program that can be; executed. These programs are generally written in high level languages; such as C or C++.

Testability,"oolingForLLVM`. Introduction; ------------. Tools built with LibTooling, like Clang Plugins, run ``FrontendActions`` over; code. .. See FIXME for a tutorial on how to write FrontendActions. In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate the different ways of running Clang's; ``SyntaxOnlyAction``, which runs a quick syntax check, over a bunch of code. Parsing a code snippet in memory; --------------------------------. If you ever wanted to run a ``FrontendAction`` over some sample code, for; example to unit test parts of the Clang AST, ``runToolOnCode`` is what you; looked for. Let me give you an example:. .. code-block:: c++. #include ""clang/Tooling/Tooling.h"". TEST(runToolOnCode, CanSyntaxCheckCode) {; // runToolOnCode returns whether the action was correctly run over the; // given code.; EXPECT_TRUE(runToolOnCode(std::make_unique<clang::SyntaxOnlyAction>(), ""class X {};""));; }. Writing a standalone tool; -------------------------. Once you unit tested your ``FrontendAction`` to the point where it cannot; possibly break, it's time to create a standalone tool. For a standalone tool; to run clang, it first needs to figure out what command line arguments to use; for a specified file. To that end we create a ``CompilationDatabase``. There; are different ways to create a compilation database, and we need to support all; of them depending on command-line options. There's the ``CommonOptionsParser``; class that takes the responsibility to parse command-line parameters related to; compilation databases and inputs, so that all tools share the implementation. Parsing common tools options; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``CompilationDatabase`` can be read from a build directory or the command line.; Using ``CommonOptionsParser`` allows for explicit specification of a compile; command line, specification of build path using the ``-p`` command-line option,; and automatic location of the compilation database using source files paths. .. code-block:: c++. #include ""clang/Tooling/CommonOption",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibTooling.rst:1233,test,tested,1233,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibTooling.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LibTooling.rst,1,['test'],['tested']

Testability,"ope, which will let the; user round out the set of operators that are supported. The point of going into user-defined operators in a tutorial like this; is to show the power and flexibility of using a hand-written parser.; Thus far, the parser we have been implementing uses recursive descent; for most parts of the grammar and operator precedence parsing for the; expressions. See `Chapter 2 <LangImpl02.html>`_ for details. By; using operator precedence parsing, it is very easy to allow; the programmer to introduce new operators into the grammar: the grammar; is dynamically extensible as the JIT runs. The two specific features we'll add are programmable unary operators; (right now, Kaleidoscope has no unary operators at all) as well as; binary operators. An example of this is:. ::. # Logical unary not.; def unary!(v); if v then; 0; else; 1;. # Define > with the same precedence as <.; def binary> 10 (LHS RHS); RHS < LHS;. # Binary ""logical or"", (note that it does not ""short circuit""); def binary| 5 (LHS RHS); if LHS then; 1; else if RHS then; 1; else; 0;. # Define = with slightly lower precedence than relationals.; def binary= 9 (LHS RHS); !(LHS < RHS | LHS > RHS);. Many languages aspire to being able to implement their standard runtime; library in the language itself. In Kaleidoscope, we can implement; significant parts of the language in the library!. We will break down implementation of these features into two parts:; implementing support for user-defined binary operators and adding unary; operators. User-defined Binary Operators; =============================. Adding support for user-defined binary operators is pretty simple with; our current framework. We'll first add support for the unary/binary; keywords:. .. code-block:: c++. enum Token {; ...; // operators; tok_binary = -11,; tok_unary = -12; };; ...; static int gettok() {; ...; if (IdentifierStr == ""for""); return tok_for;; if (IdentifierStr == ""in""); return tok_in;; if (IdentifierStr == ""binary""); return tok_",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl06.rst:2678,log,logical,2678,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl06.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl06.rst,1,['log'],['logical']

With these two simple changes, we are now able to parse unary operators; and build the AST for them. Next up, we need to add parser support for; prototypes, to parse the unary operator prototype. We extend the binary; operator code above with:. .. code-block:: c++. /// prototype; /// ::= id '(' id* ')'; /// ::= binary LETTER number? (id, id); /// ::= unary LETTER (id); static std::unique_ptr<PrototypeAST> ParsePrototype() {; std::string FnName;. unsigned Kind = 0; // 0 = identifier, 1 = unary, 2 = binary.; unsigned BinaryPrecedence = 30;. switch (CurTok) {; default:; return LogErrorP(""Expected function name in prototype"");; case tok_identifier:; FnName = IdentifierStr;; Kind = 0;; getNextToken();; break;; case tok_unary:; getNextToken();; if (!isascii(CurTok)); return LogErrorP(""Expected unary operator"");; FnName = ""unary"";; FnName += (char)CurTok;; Kind = 1;; getNextToken();; break;; case tok_binary:; ... As with binary operators, we name unary operators with a name that; includes the operator character. This assists us at code generation; time. Speaking of, the final piece we need to add is codegen support for; unary operators. It looks like this:. .. code-block:: c++. Value *UnaryExprAST::codegen() {; Value *OperandV = Operand->codegen();; if (!OperandV); return nullptr;. Function *F = getFunction(std::string(""unary"") + Opcode);; if (!F); return LogErrorV(""Unknown unary operator"");. return Builder->CreateCall(F, OperandV, ""unop"");; }.

For example, ""x = (y == 2) || (z < 10)"" is a boolean expression; that is comprised of two individual conditions, each of which evaluates to; either true or false, producing four total branch outcomes. * Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) is the percentage of individual; branch conditions that have been shown to independently affect the decision; outcome of the boolean expression they comprise. This is accomplished using; the analysis of executed control flow through the expression (i.e. test; vectors) to show that as a condition's outcome is varied between ""true"" and; false"", the decision's outcome also varies between ""true"" and false"", while; the outcome of all other conditions is held fixed (or they are masked out as; unevaluatable, as happens in languages whose logical operators have; short-circuit semantics). MC/DC builds on top of branch coverage and; requires that all code blocks and all execution paths have been tested. This; statistic is hidden by default in reports, but it can be enabled via the; ``-show-mcdc-summary`` option as long as code was also compiled using the; clang option ``-fcoverage-mcdc``. * Boolean expressions that are only comprised of one condition (and therefore; have no logical operators) are not included in MC/DC analysis and are; trivially deducible using branch coverage. Of these six statistics, function coverage is usually the least granular while; branch coverage (with MC/DC) is the most granular. 100% branch coverage for a; function implies 100% region coverage for a function. The project-wide totals; for each statistic are listed in the summary.

Notes On Building LLVM/Clang on ARM; =====================================; Here are some notes on building/testing LLVM/Clang on ARM. Note that; ARM encompasses a wide variety of CPUs; this advice is primarily based; on the ARMv6 and ARMv7 architectures and may be inapplicable to older chips. #. The most popular Linaro/Ubuntu OS's for ARM boards, e.g., the; Pandaboard, have become hard-float platforms. There are a number of; choices when using CMake. Autoconf usage is deprecated as of 3.8. Building LLVM/Clang in ``Release`` mode is preferred since it consumes; a lot less memory. Otherwise, the building process will very likely; fail due to insufficient memory. It's also a lot quicker to only build; the relevant back-ends (ARM and AArch64), since it's very unlikely that; you'll use an ARM board to cross-compile to other arches. If you're; running Compiler-RT tests, also include the x86 back-end, or some tests; will fail. .. code-block:: bash. cmake $LLVM_SRC_DIR -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \; -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=""ARM;X86;AArch64"". Other options you can use are:. .. code-block:: bash. Use Ninja instead of Make: ""-G Ninja""; Build with assertions on: ""-DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=True""; Local (non-sudo) install path: ""-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/llvm/install""; CPU flags: ""DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-mcpu=cortex-a15"" (same for CXX_FLAGS). After that, just typing ``make -jN`` or ``ninja`` will build everything.; ``make -jN check-all`` or ``ninja check-all`` will run all compiler tests. For; running the test suite, please refer to :doc:`TestingGuide`. #. If you are building LLVM/Clang on an ARM board with 1G of memory or less,; please use ``gold`` rather then GNU ``ld``. In any case it is probably a good; idea to set up a swap partition, too. .. code-block:: bash. $ sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/ld /usr/bin/ld.gold. #.

Testability,"ork we can use the scripts available in; llvm/utils/ to generate the assertions. For example to generate assertions in an :program:`llc`-based test, after; adding one or more RUN lines use:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc test.ll. This will generate FileCheck assertions, and insert a ``NOTE:`` line at the; top to indicate that assertions were automatically generated. If you want to update assertions in an existing test case, pass the `-u` option; which first checks the ``NOTE:`` line exists and matches the script name. Sometimes a test absolutely depends on hand-written assertions and should not; have assertions automatically generated. In that case, add the text ``NOTE: Do; not autogenerate`` to the first line, and the scripts will skip that test.

As such this is not a safe way to distribute LLVM or; LLVM-based tools. The simplest example of building a distribution with reasonable performance is; captured in the DistributionExample CMake cache file located at; clang/cmake/caches/DistributionExample.cmake. The following command will perform; and install the distribution build:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to clang>/cmake/caches/DistributionExample.cmake <path to LLVM source>; $ ninja stage2-distribution; $ ninja stage2-install-distribution. Difference between ``install`` and ``install-distribution``; -----------------------------------------------------------. One subtle but important thing to note is the difference between the ``install``; and ``install-distribution`` targets. The ``install`` target is expected to; install every part of LLVM that your build is configured to generate except the; LLVM testing tools. Alternatively the ``install-distribution`` target, which is; recommended for building distributions, only installs specific parts of LLVM as; specified at configuration time by *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS*. Additionally by default the ``install`` target will install the LLVM testing; tools as the public tools. This can be changed well by setting; *LLVM_INSTALL_TOOLCHAIN_ONLY* to ``On``. The LLVM tools are intended for; development and testing of LLVM, and should only be included in distributions; that support LLVM development. When building with *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* the build system also; generates a ``distribution`` target which builds all the components specified in; the list. This is a convenience build target to allow building just the; distributed pieces without needing to build all configured targets. .. _Multi-distribution configurations:.

Rationales for Static rules about cycles; ========================================. (This section is informative.). .. note::. For convenience, we use the operator ``==`` to represent the relation; ``converged-with`` and the operator ``!=`` to represent its negation. Consider a loop with (incorrect!) convergence control as in the following; pseudocode:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; WARNING: Example of incorrect convergence control!. %anchor = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor(); for (;;) {; ...; call void @convergent.op() [ ""convergencectrl""(token %anchor) ]; ...; }. This code is forbidden by the first static rule about cycles. A first formal argument why we have to do this is that the dynamic rule for; deciding whether two threads execute converged dynamic instances of; ``@convergent.op`` leads to a logical contradiction in this code.; Assume two threads execute converged dynamic instances of the anchor; followed by two iterations of the loop. Thread 1 executes dynamic instances; I1 and I2 of ``@convergent.op``, thread 2 executes dynamic instances J1 and J2.; Using all the rules, we can deduce:. 1. ``I1 != I2`` and ``J1 != J2`` by the basic rules of dynamic instances. 2. ``I1 == J1`` by the first dynamic rule about controlled convergent; operations: both threads execute the same static instruction while using; a convergence token value produced by converged dynamic instances of an; instruction (the anchor). 3. ``I1 == J2`` by the same argument. Also, ``I2 == J1`` and ``I2 == J2``. The fact that one may be *intuitively* tempted to think of ``I1`` and ``J2``; as being executed in different loop iterations is completely irrelevant for; the *formal* argument.

Testability,"ory contains a large array of small tests that exercise; various features of LLVM and to ensure that regressions do not occur.; The directory is broken into several sub-directories, each focused on a; particular area of LLVM. Writing new regression tests; ----------------------------. The regression test structure is very simple, but does require some; information to be set. This information is gathered via ``cmake``; and is written to a file, ``test/lit.site.cfg.py`` in the build directory.; The ``llvm/test`` Makefile does this work for you. In order for the regression tests to work, each directory of tests must; have a ``lit.local.cfg`` file. :program:`lit` looks for this file to determine; how to run the tests. This file is just Python code and thus is very; flexible, but we've standardized it for the LLVM regression tests. If; you're adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from; another directory to get running. The standard ``lit.local.cfg`` simply; specifies which files to look in for tests. Any directory that contains; only directories does not need the ``lit.local.cfg`` file. Read the :doc:`Lit; documentation <CommandGuide/lit>` for more information. Each test file must contain lines starting with ""RUN:"" that tell :program:`lit`; how to run it. If there are no RUN lines, :program:`lit` will issue an error; while running a test. RUN lines are specified in the comments of the test program using the; keyword ``RUN`` followed by a colon, and lastly the command (pipeline); to execute. Together, these lines form the ""script"" that :program:`lit`; executes to run the test case. The syntax of the RUN lines is similar to a; shell's syntax for pipelines including I/O redirection and variable; substitution. However, even though these lines may *look* like a shell; script, they are not. RUN lines are interpreted by :program:`lit`.; Consequently, the syntax differs from shell in a few ways. You can specify; as many RUN lines as needed. :program:`lit` perfo",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:8096,test,tests,8096,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['test'],['tests']

The default Visual; Studio configuration is **Debug** which is slow and generates a huge amount; of debug information on disk. For now, we recommend selecting **Release**; configuration for the LLVM project which will build the fastest or; **RelWithDebInfo** which is also several time larger than Release.; Another technique is to build all of LLVM in Release mode and change; compiler flags, disabling optimization and enabling debug information, only; for specific libraries or source files you actually need to debug. 14.

If; ``directory`` is left unspecified, ``configure`` uses the default value; ``/home/vadve/shared/benchmarks/speccpu2000/benchspec``. Subdirectory; names known to LLVM include:. * spec95. * speccpu2000. * speccpu2006. * povray31. Others are added from time to time, and can be determined from; ``configure``. Running Different Tests; =======================. In addition to the regular ""whole program"" tests, the ``test-suite``; module also provides a mechanism for compiling the programs in different; ways. If the variable TEST is defined on the ``gmake`` command line, the; test system will include a Makefile named; ``TEST.<value of TEST variable>.Makefile``. This Makefile can modify; build rules to yield different results. For example, the LLVM nightly tester uses ``TEST.nightly.Makefile`` to; create the nightly test reports. To run the nightly tests, run; ``gmake TEST=nightly``. There are several TEST Makefiles available in the tree. Some of them are; designed for internal LLVM research and will not work outside of the; LLVM research group. They may still be valuable, however, as a guide to; writing your own TEST Makefile for any optimization or analysis passes; that you develop with LLVM. Generating Test Output; ======================. There are a number of ways to run the tests and generate output. The; most simple one is simply running ``gmake`` with no arguments. This will; compile and run all programs in the tree using a number of different; methods and compare results. Any failures are reported in the output,; but are likely drowned in the other output. Passes are not reported; explicitly. Somewhat better is running ``gmake TEST=sometest test``, which runs the; specified test and usually adds per-program summaries to the output; (depending on which sometest you use). For example, the ``nightly`` test; explicitly outputs TEST-P",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteMakefileGuide.rst:3295,test,tests,3295,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteMakefileGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestSuiteMakefileGuide.rst,2,"['TEST', 'test']","['TEST', 'tests']"
Testability,"oryManager`` can use to identify executor memory for deallocation); and pass it to the ``OnFinalized`` callback. Finalized allocations (represented by ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects) can be; deallocated by calling the ``JITLinkMemoryManager::dealloc`` method. This method; takes a vector of ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects, since it is common to deallocate; multiple objects at the same time and this allows us to batch these requests for; transmission to the executing process. JITLink provides a simple in-process implementation of this interface:; ``InProcessMemoryManager``. It allocates pages once and re-uses them as both; working and target memory. ORC provides a cross-process-capable ``MapperJITLinkMemoryManager`` that can use; shared memory or ORC-RPC-based communication to transfer content to the executing; process. JITLinkMemoryManager and Security; ---------------------------------. JITLink's ability to link JIT'd code for a separate executor process can be; used to improve the security of a JIT system: The executor process can be; sandboxed, run within a VM, or even run on a fully separate machine. JITLink's memory manager interface is flexible enough to allow for a range of; trade-offs between performance and security. For example, on a system where code; pages must be signed (preventing code from being updated), the memory manager; can deallocate working memory pages after linking to free memory in the process; running JITLink. Alternatively, on a system that allows RWX pages, the memory; manager may use the same pages for both working and target memory by marking; them as RWX, allowing code to be modified in place without further overhead.; Finally, if RWX pages are not permitted but dual-virtual-mappings of; physical memory pages are, then the memory manager can dual map physical pages; as RW- in the JITLink process and R-X in the executor process, allowing; modification from the JITLink process but not from the executor (at the cost of; extra administrative overhead",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst:30884,sandbox,sandboxed,30884,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,1,['sandbox'],['sandboxed']

The extension can be turned off by the option ``-fno-define-target-os-macros``; as a workaround. What's New in Clang |release|?; ==============================; Some of the major new features and improvements to Clang are listed; here. Generic improvements to Clang as a whole or to its underlying; infrastructure are described first, followed by language-specific; sections with improvements to Clang's support for those languages. C++ Language Changes; --------------------. C++20 Feature Support; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; - Implemented `P1907R1 <https://wg21.link/P1907R1>`_ which extends allowed non-type template argument; kinds with e.g. floating point values and pointers and references to subobjects.; This feature is still experimental. Accordingly, ``__cpp_nontype_template_args`` was not updated.; However, its support can be tested with ``__has_extension(cxx_generalized_nttp)``. - Clang won't perform ODR checks for decls in the global module fragment any; more to ease the implementation and improve the user's using experience.; This follows the MSVC's behavior. Users interested in testing the more strict; behavior can use the flag '-Xclang -fno-skip-odr-check-in-gmf'.; (`#79240 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/79240>`_). C++23 Feature Support; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; - Implemented `P0847R7: Deducing this <https://wg21.link/P0847R7>`_. Some related core issues were also; implemented (`CWG2553 <https://wg21.link/CWG2553>`_, `CWG2554 <https://wg21.link/CWG2554>`_,; `CWG2653 <https://wg21.link/CWG2653>`_, `CWG2687 <https://wg21.link/CWG2687>`_). Because the; support for this feature is still experimental, the feature test macro ``__cpp_explicit_this_parameter``; was not set in this version.; However, its support can be tested with ``__has_extension(cxx_explicit_this_parameter)``. - Added a separate warning to w",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst:9106,test,tested,9106,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst,1,['test'],['tested']
Testability,"osed type hierarchies with manual tagged dispatch and/or RTTI rather than the; open inheritance model and virtual dispatch that is more common in C++ code.; This is because LLVM rarely encourages library consumers to extend its core; types, and leverages the closed and tag-dispatched nature of its hierarchies to; generate significantly more efficient code. We have also found that a large; amount of our usage of type hierarchies fits better with tag-based pattern; matching rather than dynamic dispatch across a common interface. Within LLVM we; have built custom helpers to facilitate this design. See this document's; section on :ref:`isa and dyn_cast <isa>` and our :doc:`detailed document; <HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI>` which describes how you can implement this; pattern for use with the LLVM helpers. .. _abi_breaking_checks:. ABI Breaking Checks; -------------------. Checks and asserts that alter the LLVM C++ ABI are predicated on the; preprocessor symbol `LLVM_ENABLE_ABI_BREAKING_CHECKS` -- LLVM; libraries built with `LLVM_ENABLE_ABI_BREAKING_CHECKS` are not ABI; compatible LLVM libraries built without it defined. By default,; turning on assertions also turns on `LLVM_ENABLE_ABI_BREAKING_CHECKS`; so a default +Asserts build is not ABI compatible with a; default -Asserts build. Clients that want ABI compatibility; between +Asserts and -Asserts builds should use the CMake build system; to set `LLVM_ENABLE_ABI_BREAKING_CHECKS` independently; of `LLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS`. .. _coreclasses:. The Core LLVM Class Hierarchy Reference; =======================================. ``#include ""llvm/IR/Type.h""``. header source: `Type.h <https://llvm.org/doxygen/Type_8h_source.html>`_. doxygen info: `Type Classes <https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Type.html>`_. The Core LLVM classes are the primary means of representing the program being; inspected or transformed. The core LLVM classes are defined in header files in; the ``include/llvm/IR`` directory, and implemented in the ``lib/IR``;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:133246,assert,asserts,133246,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['assert'],['asserts']
Testability,"ossible,; using them only to run tools that generate textual output you can then examine.; The recommended way to examine output to figure out if the test passes is using; the :doc:`FileCheck tool <CommandGuide/FileCheck>`. *[The usage of grep in RUN; lines is deprecated - please do not send or commit patches that use it.]*. Put related tests into a single file rather than having a separate file per; test. Check if there are files already covering your feature and consider; adding your code there instead of creating a new file. Generating assertions in regression tests; -----------------------------------------. Some regression test cases are very large and complex to write/update by hand.; In that case to reduce the human work we can use the scripts available in; llvm/utils/ to generate the assertions. For example to generate assertions in an :program:`llc`-based test, after; adding one or more RUN lines use:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc test.ll. This will generate FileCheck assertions, and insert a ``NOTE:`` line at the; top to indicate that assertions were automatically generated. If you want to update assertions in an existing test case, pass the `-u` option; which first checks the ``NOTE:`` line exists and matches the script name. Sometimes a test absolutely depends on hand-written assertions and should not; have assertions automatically generated. In that case, add the text ``NOTE: Do; not autogenerate`` to the first line, and the scripts will skip that test. It; is a good idea to explain why generated assertions will not work for the test; so future developers will understand what is going on. These are the most common scripts and their purposes/applications in generating; assertions:. .. code-block:: none. update_analyze_test_checks.py; opt -passes='print<cost-model>'. update_cc_test_checks.py; C/C++, or clang/clang++ (IR checks). update_llc_test_checks.py; llc (assembly checks). update_mca_test_chec",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:11627,test,test,11627,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Typically assertions are; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler. For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }.

You must also tell the configure machinery that the test suite is; available so it can be configured for your build tree:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd $LLVM_OBJ_ROOT ; $LLVM_SRC_ROOT/configure [--with-llvmgccdir=$LLVM_GCC_DIR]. [Remember that ``$LLVM_GCC_DIR`` is the directory where you; *installed* llvm-gcc, not its src or obj directory.]. #.

After; you have the suite checked out and configured, you don't need to do it; again (unless the test code or configure script changes). Configuring External Tests; ==========================. In order to run the External tests in the ``test-suite`` module, you; must specify *--with-externals*.

JIT Support; ===========. The implementation of a target machine optionally includes a Just-In-Time (JIT); code generator that emits machine code and auxiliary structures as binary; output that can be written directly to memory. To do this, implement JIT code; generation by performing the following steps:. * Write an ``XXXCodeEmitter.cpp`` file that contains a machine function pass; that transforms target-machine instructions into relocatable machine; code. * Write an ``XXXJITInfo.cpp`` file that implements the JIT interfaces for; target-specific code-generation activities, such as emitting machine code and; stubs. * Modify ``XXXTargetMachine`` so that it provides a ``TargetJITInfo`` object; through its ``getJITInfo`` method. There are several different approaches to writing the JIT support code. For; instance, TableGen and target descriptor files may be used for creating a JIT; code generator, but are not mandatory. For the Alpha and PowerPC target; machines, TableGen is used to generate ``XXXGenCodeEmitter.inc``, which; contains the binary coding of machine instructions and the; ``getBinaryCodeForInstr`` method to access those codes. Other JIT; implementations do not. Both ``XXXJITInfo.cpp`` and ``XXXCodeEmitter.cpp`` must include the; ``llvm/CodeGen/MachineCodeEmitter.h`` header file that defines the; ``MachineCodeEmitter`` class containing code for several callback functions; that write data (in bytes, words, strings, etc.) to the output stream.

The interesting-ness test that’s going to be run to reduce the code is given; by name:; `--test=<test_name>`; If a `--test` option is not given, the program exits; this option is similar; to bugpoint’s current `-compile-custom` option, which lets the user run a; custom script.

It’s worth noting that the input file; would be passed as a parameter to the test, similar how `-compile-custom`; currently operates. ### Implementation; The tool would behave similar to CReduce’s functionality in that it would have a; list of passes that try to minimize the given test-case.

This is done by making a comment containing one of the; following commands on any issue that has been added to one of the ""X.Y.Z Release""; milestones. ::. /cherry-pick <commit> <commit> <...>. This command takes one or more git commit hashes as arguments and will attempt; to cherry-pick the commit(s) to the release branch.

XRay Runtime Library; --------------------. The XRay Runtime Library is part of the compiler-rt project, which implements; the runtime components that perform the patching and unpatching of inserted; instrumentation points. When you use ``clang`` to link your binaries and the; ``-fxray-instrument`` flag, it will automatically link in the XRay runtime. The default implementation of the XRay runtime will enable XRay instrumentation; before ``main`` starts, which works for applications that have a short; lifetime. This implementation also records all function entry and exit events; which may result in a lot of records in the resulting trace. Also by default the filename of the XRay trace is ``xray-log.XXXXXX`` where the; ``XXXXXX`` part is randomly",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/XRay.rst:4316,Log,Log,4316,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/XRay.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/XRay.rst,1,['Log'],['Log']

First are the fields we want to get back from the query:; * `all` - Return all fields.; * `fields` - Means that we will provide a list of fields we are interested in. The second set are the logical operators for what will become the `WHERE` clause (called `condition` in the TableGen). These are string versions of various symbols. For example `ne` means `!=`, which in SQL is `<>`. Finally `none` is used to mean there is no condition to the query (no `WHERE`). ```python; query_tblgen += """"""\; class Query <string table, dag query_fields = (all), dag condition = (none)> {; string TableName = table;; dag Fields = query_fields;; dag WhereClause = condition;; list<string> OrderedBy = [];; }; """"""; ```. Then the Query class. Its arguments are:; * `table` - The name of the table to query (`FROM <table>`).; * `query_fields` - The fields you want returned (`SELECT <fields>`).; * Defaults to `all` meaning return all fields.; * `condition` - Logic to select entries (`WHERE <conditions>`).; * Defaults to `none` meaning there is no condition, or in other words select all entries in the table. ## Using The Query Class. ```python; full_tblgen = query_tblgen + """"""\; def : Query<""Customer"">;. def : Query<""Orders"", (fields ""Person"", ""Amount"")>;. def : Query<""Customer"", (fields ""Affiliation""),; (eq ""Name"", ""Mary Blackburn"":$str)>;. def : Query<""Orders"", (fields ""ProductName""),; (gt ""Amount"", 8)>;. def : Query<""Orders"", (fields ""ProductName"":$name, ""Person""),; (and (gt ""Amount"", 8), (ne ""Person"", 1))> {; let OrderedBy = [""$name""];; }; """"""; ```.

Actually, this would be a great time to read the rest of the `developer; policy <https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html>`__, too. At minimum,; you need to be subscribed to the relevant commits list before landing; changes (e.g. llvm-commits@lists.llvm.org), as discussion often happens; there if a new patch causes problems. Post-commit errors; ------------------. Once your change is submitted it will be picked up by automated build; bots that will build and test your patch in a variety of configurations. You can see all configurations and their current state in a waterfall; view at http://lab.llvm.org/buildbot/#/waterfall. The waterfall view is good; to get a general overview over the tested configurations and to see; which configuration have been broken for a while. The console view at http://lab.llvm.org/buildbot/#/console helps to get a; better understanding of the build results of a specific patch.

Don't assume you're linking in-process. Use libSupport's sized,; endian-specific types when reading/writing content in the ``LinkGraph``. As a ""minimum viable"" JITLink wrapper, the ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is an; invaluable resource for developers bringing in a new JITLink backend. A standard; workflow is to start by throwing an unsupported object at the tool and seeing; what error is returned, then fixing that (you can often make a reasonable guess; at what should be done based on existing code for other formats or; architectures). In debug builds of LLVM, the ``-debug-only=jitlink`` option dumps logs from the; JITLink library during the link process. These can be useful for spotting some bugs at; a glance. The ``-debug-only=llvm_jitlink`` option dumps logs from the ``llvm-jitlink``; tool, which can be useful for debugging both testcases (it is often less verbose than; ``-debug-only=jitlink``) and the tool itself. The ``-oop-executor`` and ``-oop-executor-connect`` options are helpful for testing; handling of cross-process and cross-architecture use cases. Roadmap; =======. JITLink is under active development. Work so far has focused on the MachO; implementation. In LLVM 12 there is limited support for ELF on x86-64. Major outstanding projects include:. * Refactor architecture support to maximize sharing across formats. All formats should be able to share the bulk of the architecture specific; code (especially relocations) for each supported architecture. * Refactor ELF link graph construction. ELF's link graph construction is currently implemented in the `ELF_x86_64.cpp`; file, and tied to the x86-64 relocation parsing code. The bulk of the code is; generic and should be split into an ELFLinkGraphBuilder base class along the; same lines as the existing generic MachOLinkGraphBuilder. * Imple",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst:44094,log,logs,44094,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/JITLink.rst,2,"['log', 'test']","['logs', 'testcases']"

We are again restricted to; approximating the result we want with matchers, filling in the details; in the callback. So we start with:. .. code-block:: c++. hasCondition(binaryOperator(hasOperatorName(""<""))).

Testability,"ow it works; =================================. .. contents::; :local:. Introduction; ============; Sometimes code contains equal functions, or functions that does exactly the same; thing even though they are non-equal on the IR level (e.g.: multiplication on 2; and 'shl 1'). It could happen due to several reasons: mainly, the usage of; templates and automatic code generators. Though, sometimes the user itself could; write the same thing twice :-). The main purpose of this pass is to recognize such functions and merge them. This document is the extension to pass comments and describes the pass logic. It; describes the algorithm that is used in order to compare functions and; explains how we could combine equal functions correctly to keep the module; valid. Material is brought in a top-down form, so the reader could start to learn pass; from high level ideas and end with low-level algorithm details, thus preparing; him or her for reading the sources. The main goal is to describe the algorithm and logic here and the concept. If; you *don't want* to read the source code, but want to understand pass; algorithms, this document is good for you. The author tries not to repeat the; source-code and covers only common cases to avoid the cases of needing to; update this document after any minor code changes.

At best, such code would do twice as much work as; necessary; quite frequently, however, ARC and the explicit code would both; try to balance the same retain, leading to crashes. The cost is losing the; ability to perform ""unrooted"" retains, i.e. retains not logically; corresponding to a strong reference in the object graph. **Ignoring** them would badly violate user expectations about their code.; While it *would* make it easier to develop code simultaneously for ARC and; non-ARC, there is very little reason to do so except for certain library; developers. ARC and non-ARC translation units share an execution model and; can seamlessly interoperate. Within a translation unit, a developer who; faithfully maintains their code in non-ARC mode is suffering all the; restrictions of ARC for zero benefit, while a developer who isn't testing the; non-ARC mode is likely to be unpleasantly surprised if they try to go back to; it. **Banning** them has the disadvantage of making it very awkward to migrate; existing code to ARC. The best answer to that, given a number of other; changes and restrictions in ARC, is to provide a specialized tool to assist; users in that migration. Implementing these methods was banned because they are too integral to the; semantics of ARC; many tricks which worked tolerably under manual reference; counting will misbehave if ARC performs an ephemeral extra retain or two. If; absolutely required, it is still possible to implement them in non-ARC code,; for example in a category; the implementations must obey the :ref:`semantics; <arc.objects.retains>` laid out elsewhere in this document. .. _arc.misc.special_methods.dealloc:. ``dealloc``; ^^^^^^^^^^^.

If the error condition can be triggered by user input then the; recoverable error mechanism described in :doc:`ProgrammersManual` should be; used instead. In cases where this is not practical, ``report_fatal_error`` may; be used. Another issue is that values used only by assertions will produce an ""unused; value"" warning when assertions are disabled. For example, this code will warn:. .. code-block:: c++. unsigned Size = V.size();; assert(Size > 42 && ""Vector smaller than it should be"");. bool NewToSet = Myset.insert(Value);; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");. These are two interesting different cases. In the first case, the call to; ``V.size()`` is only useful for the assert, and we don't want it executed when; assertions are disabled. Code like this should move the call into the assert; itself. In the second case, the side effects of the call must happen whether; the assert is enabled or not. In this case, the value should be cast to void to; disable the warning. To be specific, it is preferred to write the code like; this:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(V.size() > 42 && ""Vector smaller than it should be"");. bool NewToSet = Myset.insert(Value); (void)NewToSet;; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");.

The point of going into user-defined operators in a tutorial like this; is to show the power and flexibility of using a hand-written parser.; Thus far, the parser we have been implementing uses recursive descent; for most parts of the grammar and operator precedence parsing for the; expressions. See `Chapter 2 <LangImpl02.html>`_ for details. By; using operator precedence parsing, it is very easy to allow; the programmer to introduce new operators into the grammar: the grammar; is dynamically extensible as the JIT runs. The two specific features we'll add are programmable unary operators; (right now, Kaleidoscope has no unary operators at all) as well as; binary operators. An example of this is:. ::. # Logical unary not.; def unary!(v); if v then; 0; else; 1;. # Define > with the same precedence as <.; def binary> 10 (LHS RHS); RHS < LHS;. # Binary ""logical or"", (note that it does not ""short circuit""); def binary| 5 (LHS RHS); if LHS then; 1; else if RHS then; 1; else; 0;. # Define = with slightly lower precedence than relationals.; def binary= 9 (LHS RHS); !(LHS < RHS | LHS > RHS);. Many languages aspire to being able to implement their standard runtime; library in the language itself. In Kaleidoscope, we can implement; significant parts of the language in the library!. We will break down implementation of these features into two parts:; implementing support for user-defined binary operators and adding unary; operators.

Testability,"own how to retrieve the data arrays from the branches of the tree; in the previous section, and you could just write that program from; scratch. Since this is a very common task, ROOT provides a utility that; generates a skeleton class designed to loop over the entries of the; tree. This is the `TTree::MakeClass` method. We will now go through the steps; of using `MakeClass` with a simplified example. The methods used here; obviously work for complex event loop calculations. These are our assumptions: we would like to do selective plotting and; loop through each entry of the tree and tracks. We chose a simple; example: we want to plot `fPx` of the first 100 tracks of each entry. We; have a ROOT tree with a branch for each data member in the ""`Event`""; object. To build this file and tree follow the instructions on how to; build the examples in `$ROOTSYS/test`. Execute `Event` and instruct it; to split the object with this command (from the UNIX command line). ``` {.cpp}; > $ROOTSYS/test/Event 400 1 2 1; ```. This creates an `Event.root` file with 400 events, compressed, split,; and filled. See `$ROOTSYS/test/MainEvent.cxx` for more info. The person who designed the tree makes a shared library available to; you, which defines the classes needed. In this case, the classes are; Event, `EventHeader`, and Track and they are defined in the shared; library `libEvent.so`. The designer also gives you the `Event.h` file to; see the definition of the classes. You can locate `Event.h` in; `$ROOTSYS/test`, and if you have not yet built `libEvent.so`, please see; the instructions of how to build it (typing make in \$ROOTSYS/test is; enough). If you have already built it, you can now use it again. ### Creating a Class with MakeClass.

Testability,"ows paths will fail on Linux and vice-versa.; * Tests that check for ``x86_64`` somewhere in the text will fail anywhere else.; * Tests where the debug information calculates the size of types and structures. Also, if the test rely on any behaviour that is coded in any back-end, it must; go in its own directory. So, for instance, code generator tests for ARM go; into ``test/CodeGen/ARM`` and so on. Those directories contain a special; ``lit`` configuration file that ensure all tests in that directory will; only run if a specific back-end is compiled and available. For instance, on ``test/CodeGen/ARM``, the ``lit.local.cfg`` is:. .. code-block:: python. config.suffixes = ['.ll', '.c', '.cpp', '.test']; if not 'ARM' in config.root.targets:; config.unsupported = True. Other platform-specific tests are those that depend on a specific feature; of a specific sub-architecture, for example only to Intel chips that support ``AVX2``. For instance, ``test/CodeGen/X86/psubus.ll`` tests three sub-architecture; variants:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llc -mcpu=core2 < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=SSE2; ; RUN: llc -mcpu=corei7-avx < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=AVX1; ; RUN: llc -mcpu=core-avx2 < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=AVX2. And the checks are different:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; SSE2: @test1; ; SSE2: psubusw LCPI0_0(%rip), %xmm0; ; AVX1: @test1; ; AVX1: vpsubusw LCPI0_0(%rip), %xmm0, %xmm0; ; AVX2: @test1; ; AVX2: vpsubusw LCPI0_0(%rip), %xmm0, %xmm0. So, if you're testing for a behaviour that you know is platform-specific or; depends on special features of sub-architectures, you must add the specific; triple, test with the specific FileCheck and put it into the specific; directory that will filter out all other architectures.

For function definitions, we start by searching TheModule's symbol table for an; existing version of this function, in case one has already been created using an; 'extern' statement. If Module::getFunction returns null then no previous version; exists, so we'll codegen one from the Prototype. In either case, we want to; assert that the function is empty (i.e. has no body yet) before we start. .. code-block:: c++. // Create a new basic block to start insertion into.; BasicBlock *BB = BasicBlock::Create(*TheContext, ""entry"", TheFunction);; Builder->SetInsertPoint(BB);. // Record the function arguments in the NamedValues map.; NamedValues.clear();; for (auto &Arg : TheFunction->args()); NamedValues[std::string(Arg.getName())] = &Arg;.

Testability,"p://python.org>`_ 3.6 or; later. LLVM Testing Infrastructure Organization; ========================================. The LLVM testing infrastructure contains three major categories of tests:; unit tests, regression tests and whole programs. The unit tests and regression; tests are contained inside the LLVM repository itself under ``llvm/unittests``; and ``llvm/test`` respectively and are expected to always pass -- they should be; run before every commit. The whole programs tests are referred to as the ""LLVM test suite"" (or; ""test-suite"") and are in the ``test-suite``; `repository on GitHub <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git>`_.; For historical reasons, these tests are also referred to as the ""nightly; tests"" in places, which is less ambiguous than ""test-suite"" and remains; in use although we run them much more often than nightly. Unit tests; ----------. Unit tests are written using `Google Test <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/primer.md>`_; and `Google Mock <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/gmock_for_dummies.md>`_; and are located in the ``llvm/unittests`` directory.; In general unit tests are reserved for targeting the support library and other; generic data structure, we prefer relying on regression tests for testing; transformations and analysis on the IR. Regression tests; ----------------. The regression tests are small pieces of code that test a specific; feature of LLVM or trigger a specific bug in LLVM. The language they are; written in depends on the part of LLVM being tested. These tests are driven by; the :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool (which is part of LLVM), and; are located in the ``llvm/test`` directory. Typically when a bug is found in LLVM, a regression test containing just; enough code to reproduce the problem should be written and placed; somewhere underneath this directory. For example, it can be a small; piece of LLVM IR distilled from an actual application or benchmark.

The current implementation does roughly the following:. * The compiler instruments all CMP instructions with a callback that receives both CMP arguments.; * The callback computes `(caller_pc&4095) | (popcnt(Arg1 ^ Arg2) << 12)` and uses this value to set a bit in a bitset.; * Every new observed bit in the bitset is treated as new coverage. This feature has a potential to discover many interesting inputs,; but there are two downsides.; First, the extra instrumentation may bring up to 2x additional slowdown.; Second, the corpus may grow by several times. Fuzzer-friendly build mode; ---------------------------; Sometimes the code under test is not fuzzing-friendly. Examples:. - The target code uses a PRNG seeded e.g. by system time and; thus two consequent invocations may potentially execute different code paths; even if the end result will be the same. This will cause a fuzzer to treat; two similar inputs as significantly different and it will blow up the test corpus.; E.g. libxml uses ``rand()`` inside its hash table.; - The target code uses checksums to protect from invalid inputs.; E.g. png checks CRC for every chunk. In many cases it makes sense to build a special fuzzing-friendly build; with certain fuzzing-unfriendly features disabled. We propose to use a common build macro; for all such cases for consistency: ``FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION``. .. code-block:: c++. void MyInitPRNG() {; #ifdef FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION; // In fuzzing mode the behavior of the code should be deterministic.; srand(0);; #else; srand(time(0));; #endif; }. AFL compatibility; -----------------; LibFuzzer can be used together with AFL_ on the same test corpus.; Both fuzzers expect the test corpus to reside in a directory, one file per input.; You can run both fuzzers on the same corpus, one after another:. .. code-block:: console. ./afl-fuzz -i testcase_dir -o findings_dir /path/to/pr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst:21614,test,test,21614,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LibFuzzer.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Custom Assertion Handlers. The analyzer exploits code assertions by pruning off paths where the; assertion condition is false. The idea is capture any program invariants; specified in the assertion that the developer may know but is not immediately; apparent in the code itself. In this way assertions make implicit assumptions; explicit in the code, which not only makes the analyzer more accurate when; finding bugs, but can help others better able to understand your code as well.; It can also help remove certain kinds of analyzer false positives by pruning off; false paths.; In order to exploit assertions, however, the analyzer must understand when it; encounters an ""assertion handler."" Typically assertions are; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler. For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where t",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html:20191,assert,assertions,20191,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html,2,['assert'],"['assertion', 'assertions']"

This is an extension supported by Clang and; GCC, but is very easy to accidentally use without realizing it's a; nonportable construct that has different semantics from a constant-sized; array. (`#62836 <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/62836>`_). - Clang changed the order in which it displays candidate functions on overloading failures.; Previously, Clang used definition of ordering from the C++ Standard. The order defined in; the Standard is partial and is not suited for sorting. Instead, Clang now uses a strict; order that still attempts to push more relevant functions to the top by comparing their; corresponding conversions. In some cases, this results in better order. E.g., for the; following code. .. code-block:: cpp. struct Foo {; operator int();; operator const char*();; };. void test() { Foo() - Foo(); }. Clang now produces a list with two most relevant builtin operators at the top,; i.e. ``operator-(int, int)`` and ``operator-(const char*, const char*)``.; Previously ``operator-(const char*, const char*)`` was the first element,; but ``operator-(int, int)`` was only the 13th element in the output.; However, new implementation does not take into account some aspects of; C++ semantics, e.g. which function template is more specialized. This; can sometimes lead to worse ordering. - When describing a warning/error in a function-style type conversion Clang underlines only until; the end of the expression we convert from.

Feature Test Macros; ===================; Clang implements several ways to test whether a feature is supported or not.; Some of these feature tests are standardized, like ``__has_cpp_attribute`` or; ``__cpp_lambdas``, while others are Clang extensions, like ``__has_builtin``.; The common theme among all the various feature tests is that they are a utility; to tell users that we think a particular feature is complete. However,; completeness is a difficult property to define because features may still have; lingering bugs, may only work on some targets, etc. We use the following; criteria when deciding whether to expose a feature test macro (or particular; result value for the feature test):. * Are there known issues where we reject valid code that should be accepted?; * Are there known issues where we accept invalid code that should be rejected?; * Are there known crashes, failed assertions, or miscompilations?; * Are there known issues on a particular relevant target?.

Though these lines are still drowned in the output, it's easy; to grep the output logs in the Output directories. Even better are the ``report`` and ``report.format`` targets (where; ``format`` is one of ``html``, ``csv``, ``text`` or ``graphs``). The; exact contents of the report are dependent on which ``TEST`` you are; running, but the text results are always shown at the end of the run and; the results are always stored in the ``report.<type>.format`` file (when; running with ``TEST=<type>``). The ``report`` also generate a file; called ``report.<type>.raw.out`` containing the output of the entire; test run. Writing Custom Tests for the test-suite; =======================================. Assuming you can run the test suite, (e.g.; ""``gmake TEST=nightly report``"" should work), it is really easy to run; optimizations or code generator components against every program in the; tree, collecting statistics or running custom checks for correctness. At; base, this is how the nightly tester works, it's just one example of a; general framework. Lets say that you have an LLVM optimization pass, and you want to see; how many times it triggers. First thing you should do is add an LLVM; `statistic <ProgrammersManual.html#Statistic>`_ to your pass, which will; tally counts of things you care about. Following this, you can set up a test and a report that collects these; and formats them for easy viewing. This consists of two files, a; ""``test-suite/TEST.XXX.Makefile``"" fragment (where XXX is the name of; your test) and a ""``test-suite/TEST.XXX.report``"" file that indicates; how to format the output into a table. There are many example reports of; various levels of sophistication included with the test suite, and the; framework is very general.

Optionally the user can pass the parameter to scan, if it is not passed, the first parameter of interest of the; null model will be used.

You can download a build of Clang for Windows; that has libFuzzer from; `LLVM Snapshot Builds <https://llvm.org/builds/>`_. Using libFuzzer on Windows without ASAN is unsupported. Building fuzzers with the; ``/MD`` (dynamic runtime library) compile option is unsupported. Support for these; may be added in the future. Linking fuzzers with the ``/INCREMENTAL`` link option; (or the ``/DEBUG`` option which implies it) is also unsupported. Send any questions or comments to the mailing list: libfuzzer(#)googlegroups.com. Q. When libFuzzer is not a good solution for a problem?; ---------------------------------------------------------. * If the test inputs are validated by the target library and the validator; asserts/crashes on invalid inputs, in-process fuzzing is not applicable.; * Bugs in the target library may accumulate without being detected. E.g. a memory; corruption that goes undetected at first and then leads to a crash while; testing another input. This is why it is highly recommended to run this; in-process fuzzer with all sanitizers to detect most bugs on the spot.; * It is harder to protect the in-process fuzzer from excessive memory; consumption and infinite loops in the target library (still possible).; * The target library should not have significant global state that is not; reset between the runs.; * Many interesting target libraries are not designed in a way that supports; the in-process fuzzer interface (e.g. require a file path instead of a; byte array).; * If a single test run takes a considerable fraction of a second (or; more) the speed benefit from the in-process fuzzer is negligible.; * If the target library runs persistent threads (that outlive; execution of one test) the fuzzing results will be unreliable.

Testability,"possible even; for broken code. Recovery AST; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. The idea of Recovery AST is to use recovery nodes which act as a placeholder to; maintain the rough structure of the parsing tree, preserve locations and; children but have no language semantics attached to them. For example, consider the following mismatched function call:. .. code-block:: c++. int NoArg();; void test(int abc) {; NoArg(abc); // oops, mismatched function arguments.; }. Without Recovery AST, the invalid function call expression (and its child; expressions) would be dropped in the AST:. ::. |-FunctionDecl <line:1:1, col:11> NoArg 'int ()'; `-FunctionDecl <line:2:1, line:4:1> test 'void (int)'; |-ParmVarDecl <col:11, col:15> col:15 used abc 'int'; `-CompoundStmt <col:20, line:4:1>. With Recovery AST, the AST looks like:. ::. |-FunctionDecl <line:1:1, col:11> NoArg 'int ()'; `-FunctionDecl <line:2:1, line:4:1> test 'void (int)'; |-ParmVarDecl <col:11, col:15> used abc 'int'; `-CompoundStmt <col:20, line:4:1>; `-RecoveryExpr <line:3:3, col:12> 'int' contains-errors; |-UnresolvedLookupExpr <col:3> '<overloaded function type>' lvalue (ADL) = 'NoArg'; `-DeclRefExpr <col:9> 'int' lvalue ParmVar 'abc' 'int'. An alternative is to use existing Exprs, e.g. CallExpr for the above example.; This would capture more call details (e.g. locations of parentheses) and allow; it to be treated uniformly with valid CallExprs. However, jamming the data we; have into CallExpr forces us to weaken its invariants, e.g. arg count may be; wrong. This would introduce a huge burden on consumers of the AST to handle such; ""impossible"" cases. So when we're representing (rather than correcting) errors,; we use a distinct recovery node type with extremely weak invariants instead. ``RecoveryExpr`` is the only recovery node so far. In practice, broken decls; need more detailed semantics preserved (the current ``Invalid`` flag works; fairly well), and completely broken statements with interesting internal; structure are rare (so ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:86523,test,test,86523,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['test'],['test']

The following describes issues in the current implementation of modules.; Please see https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/labels/clang%3Amodules for more issues; or file a new issue if you don't find an existing one.; If you're going to create a new issue for standard C++ modules,; please start the title with ``[C++20] [Modules]`` (or ``[C++23] [Modules]``, etc); and add the label ``clang:modules`` (if you have permissions for that). For higher level support for proposals, you could visit https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html. Including headers after import is problematic; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. For example, the following example can be accept:. .. code-block:: c++. #include <iostream>; import foo; // assume module 'foo' contain the declarations from `<iostream>`. int main(int argc, char *argv[]); {; std::cout << ""Test\n"";; return 0;; }. but it will get rejected if we reverse the order of ``#include <iostream>`` and; ``import foo;``:. .. code-block:: c++. import foo; // assume module 'foo' contain the declarations from `<iostream>`; #include <iostream>. int main(int argc, char *argv[]); {; std::cout << ""Test\n"";; return 0;; }. Both of the above examples should be accepted. This is a limitation in the implementation. In the first example,; the compiler will see and parse <iostream> first then the compiler will see the import.; So the ODR Checking and declarations merging will happen in the deserializer.; In the second example, the compiler will see the import first and the include second.; As a result, the ODR Checking and declarations merging will happen in the semantic analyzer.

Testability,"ppears"". Setting the calling convention on the caller and; callee is required for indirect calls to work, so people often ask why not; make the verifier reject this sort of thing. The answer is that this code has undefined behavior, but it is not illegal.; If we made it illegal, then every transformation that could potentially create; this would have to ensure that it doesn't, and there is valid code that can; create this sort of construct (in dead code). The sorts of things that can; cause this to happen are fairly contrived, but we still need to accept them.; Here's an example:. .. code-block:: llvm. define fastcc void @foo() {; ret void; }; define internal void @bar(void()* %FP, i1 %cond) {; br i1 %cond, label %T, label %F; T:; call void %FP(); ret void; F:; call fastcc void %FP(); ret void; }; define void @test() {; %X = or i1 false, false; call void @bar(void()* @foo, i1 %X); ret void; }. In this example, ""test"" always passes ``@foo``/``false`` into ``bar``, which; ensures that it is dynamically called with the right calling conv (thus, the; code is perfectly well defined). If you run this through the inliner, you; get this (the explicit ""or"" is there so that the inliner doesn't dead code; eliminate a bunch of stuff):. .. code-block:: llvm. define fastcc void @foo() {; ret void; }; define void @test() {; %X = or i1 false, false; br i1 %X, label %T.i, label %F.i; T.i:; call void @foo(); br label %bar.exit; F.i:; call fastcc void @foo(); br label %bar.exit; bar.exit:; ret void; }. Here you can see that the inlining pass made an undefined call to ``@foo``; with the wrong calling convention. We really don't want to make the inliner; have to know about this sort of thing, so it needs to be valid code. In this; case, dead code elimination can trivially remove the undefined code. However,; if ``%X`` was an input argument to ``@test``, the inliner would produce this:. .. code-block:: llvm. define fastcc void @foo() {; ret void; }. define void @test(i1 %X) {; br i1 %X, l",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FAQ.rst:10839,test,test,10839,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FAQ.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FAQ.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"pport in their AST representation. With LLVM, you don't need this support in the AST. Since all calls to; build LLVM IR go through the LLVM IR builder, the builder itself checked; to see if there was a constant folding opportunity when you call it. If; so, it just does the constant fold and return the constant instead of; creating an instruction. Well, that was easy :). In practice, we recommend always using; ``IRBuilder`` when generating code like this. It has no ""syntactic; overhead"" for its use (you don't have to uglify your compiler with; constant checks everywhere) and it can dramatically reduce the amount of; LLVM IR that is generated in some cases (particular for languages with a; macro preprocessor or that use a lot of constants). On the other hand, the ``IRBuilder`` is limited by the fact that it does; all of its analysis inline with the code as it is built. If you take a; slightly more complex example:. ::. ready> def test(x) (1+2+x)*(x+(1+2));; ready> Read function definition:; define double @test(double %x) {; entry:; %addtmp = fadd double 3.000000e+00, %x; %addtmp1 = fadd double %x, 3.000000e+00; %multmp = fmul double %addtmp, %addtmp1; ret double %multmp; }. In this case, the LHS and RHS of the multiplication are the same value.; We'd really like to see this generate ""``tmp = x+3; result = tmp*tmp;``""; instead of computing ""``x+3``"" twice. Unfortunately, no amount of local analysis will be able to detect and; correct this. This requires two transformations: reassociation of; expressions (to make the add's lexically identical) and Common; Subexpression Elimination (CSE) to delete the redundant add instruction.; Fortunately, LLVM provides a broad range of optimizations that you can; use, in the form of ""passes"".

The appropriate sub-directory should be selected (see the; :doc:`Testing Guide <TestingGuide>` for details). * Test cases should be written in :doc:`LLVM assembly language <LangRef>`. * Test cases, especially for regressions, should be reduced as much as possible,; by :doc:`bugpoint <Bugpoint>` or manually. It is unacceptable to place an; entire failing program into ``llvm/test`` as this creates a *time-to-test*; burden on all developers. Please keep them short. * Avoid adding links to resources that are not available to the entire; community, such as links to private bug trackers, internal corporate; documentation, etc. Instead, add sufficient comments to the test to provide; the context behind such links. Note that llvm/test and clang/test are designed for regression and small feature; tests only.

Testability,"primary aims of ``llvm-jitlink`` was to enable readable regression; tests for JITLink. To do this it supports two options:. The ``-noexec`` option tells llvm-jitlink to stop after looking up the entry; point, and before attempting to execute it. Since the linked code is not; executed, this can be used to link for other targets even if you do not have; access to the target being linked (the ``-define-abs`` or ``-phony-externals``; options can be used to supply any missing definitions in this case). The ``-check <check-file>`` option can be used to run a set of ``jitlink-check``; expressions against working memory. It is typically used in conjunction with; ``-noexec``, since the aim is to validate JIT'd memory rather than to run the; code and ``-noexec`` allows us to link for any supported target architecture; from the current process. In ``-check`` mode, ``llvm-jitlink`` will scan the; given check-file for lines of the form ``# jitlink-check: <expr>``. See; examples of this usage in ``llvm/test/ExecutionEngine/JITLink``.

By default ``llvm-jitlink`` will link the given objects into its own process,; but this can be overridden by two options:.

Testability,"prints TRUE or FALSE according to; the value of its argument. If a call occurs outside an inlined function,; nothing is printed. The intended use of this checker is to assert that a function is inlined at; least once (by passing 'true' and expecting a warning), or to assert that a; function is never inlined (by passing 'false' and expecting no warning). The; argument is technically unnecessary but is intended to clarify intent. You might wonder why we can't print TRUE if a function is ever inlined and; FALSE if it is not. The problem is that any inlined function could conceivably; also be analyzed as a top-level function (in which case both TRUE and FALSE; would be printed), depending on the value of the -analyzer-inlining option. In C, the argument can be typed as 'int' or as '_Bool'.

Testability,"program:: llvm-exegesis. SYNOPSIS; --------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` [*options*]. DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` is a benchmarking tool that uses information available; in LLVM to measure host machine instruction characteristics like latency,; throughput, or port decomposition. Given an LLVM opcode name and a benchmarking mode, :program:`llvm-exegesis`; generates a code snippet that makes execution as serial (resp. as parallel) as; possible so that we can measure the latency (resp. inverse throughput/uop decomposition); of the instruction.; The code snippet is jitted and, unless requested not to, executed on the; host subtarget. The time taken (resp. resource usage) is measured using; hardware performance counters. The result is printed out as YAML; to the standard output. The main goal of this tool is to automatically (in)validate the LLVM's TableDef; scheduling models. To that end, we also provide analysis of the results. :program:`llvm-exegesis` can also benchmark arbitrary user-provided code; snippets. SUPPORTED PLATFORMS; -------------------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` currently only supports X86 (64-bit only), ARM (AArch64; only), MIPS, and PowerPC (PowerPC64LE only) on Linux for benchmarking. Not all; benchmarking functionality is guaranteed to work on every platform.; :program:`llvm-exegesis` also has a separate analysis mode that is supported; on every platform that LLVM is. SNIPPET ANNOTATIONS; -------------------. :program:`llvm-exegesis` supports benchmarking arbitrary snippets of assembly.; However, benchmarking these snippets often requires some setup so that they; can execute properly. :program:`llvm-exegesis` has five annotations and some; additional utilities to help with setup so that snippets can be benchmarked; properly. * `LLVM-EXEGESIS-DEFREG <register name>` - Adding this annotation to the text; assembly snippet to be benchmarked marks the register as requiring a definition.; A value will automatically be provided unless a s",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst:1100,benchmark,benchmark,1100,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-exegesis.rst,1,['benchmark'],['benchmark']
Testability,"program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer` parses debug and text sections in; binary object files and prints their contents in a logical view, which; is a human readable representation that closely matches the structure; of the original user source code. Supported object file formats include; ELF, Mach-O, PDB and COFF. The **logical view** abstracts the complexity associated with the; different low-level representations of the debugging information that; is embedded in the object file. :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer`; produces a canonical view of the debug information regardless of how it; is formatted. The same logical view will be seen regardless of object; file format, assuming the debug information correctly represents the; same original source code. The logical view includes the following **logical elements**: *type*,; *scope*, *symbol* and *line*, which are the basic software elements used; in the C/C++ programming language. Each logical element has a set of; **attributes**, such as *types*, *classes*, *functions*, *variables*,; *parameters*, etc. The :option:`--attribute` can be used to specify which; attributes to include when printing a logical element. A logical element; may have a **kind** that describes specific types of elements. For; instance, a *scope* could have a kind value of *function*, *class*,; *namespace*. :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer` defaults to print a pre-defined; layout of logical elements and attributes. The command line options can; be used to control the printed elements (:option:`--print`), using a; specific layout (:option:`--report`), matching a given pattern; (:option:`--select`, :option:`--select-offsets`). Also, the output can; be limited to specified logical elements using (:option:`--select-lines`,; :option:`--select-scopes`, :option:`--select-symbols`,; :option:`--select-types`). :program:`llvm-debuginfo-analyzer` can also compare a set of logical; views (:option:`--compare`), to find differences and identify possible; debug info",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-debuginfo-analyzer.rst:1298,log,logical,1298,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-debuginfo-analyzer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-debuginfo-analyzer.rst,1,['log'],['logical']

The ROOT [reference guide](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/index.html) is moving; to the Doxygen system. Doxygen is the de-facto standard for code documentation. It offers; many nice features we are now exploring and trying to get the best of them. Having; [MathJax rendered math formula](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTSpectrum2.html#a482a7f144b9cc1b0405d0ac0d8cc9bbb); is one of them. The documentation can be structured in a more logical way; [using groups](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/modules.html). Still there is a lot; to do but big progresses have been done. We developed also a Doxygen filter allowing; to execute macros given as examples in the documentation and show the; [resulting picture directly in the documentation](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTHistPainter.html#HP16). ## Tutorials. [The tutorials](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/group__Tutorials.html) in; `$ROOTSYS/tutorials` are also presented on the web thanks to Doxygen. They; are now part of the reference guide allowing nice cross-referencing with the; classes documentation. Here also a filter has been developed to generate; [the resulting picture](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/ContourList_8C.html). ## Build, Configuration and Testing Infrastructure. ROOT uses the CMake cross-platform build-generator tool as a primary build system. CMake does not build the project, it generates the files needed by your build tool (GNU make, Ninja, Visual Studio, etc) for building ROOT. The classic build with configure/make is is still available but it will not be evolving with the new features of ROOT. We added full support for C++14. Minor changes in the build system:. - Renamed build option POSTGRESQL_LIBRARIES to POSTGRESQL_LIBRARY; - Added build option `builtin_openssl` to build OpenSSL internally. This is specially needed for the latest Mac OSX (El Capitan); ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v606/index.md:24786,Test,Testing,24786,README/ReleaseNotes/v606/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v606/index.md,1,['Test'],['Testing']

For example, to run the; ``Integer/BitPacked.ll`` test by itself you can run:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm-lit ~/llvm/test/Integer/BitPacked.ll. or to run all of the ARM CodeGen tests:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm-lit ~/llvm/test/CodeGen/ARM. The regression tests will use the Python psutil module only if installed in a; **non-user** location. Under Linux, install with sudo or within a virtual; environment. Under Windows, install Python for all users and then run; ``pip install psutil`` in an elevated command prompt. For more information on using the :program:`lit` tool, see ``llvm-lit --help``; or the :doc:`lit man page <CommandGuide/lit>`. Debugging Information tests; ---------------------------. To run debugging information tests simply add the ``cross-project-tests``; project to your ``LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`` define on the cmake; command-line. Regression test structure; =========================. The LLVM regression tests are driven by :program:`lit` and are located in the; ``llvm/test`` directory. This directory contains a large array of small tests that exercise; various features of LLVM and to ensure that regressions do not occur.; The directory is broken into several sub-directories, each focused on a; particular area of LLVM. Writing new regression tests; ----------------------------. The regression test structure is very simple, but does require some; information to be set. This information is gathered via ``cmake``; and is written to a file, ``test/lit.site.cfg.py`` in the build directory.; The ``llvm/test`` Makefile does this work for you. In order for the regression tests to work, each directory of tests must; have a ``lit.local.cfg`` file. :program:`lit` looks for this file to determine; how to run the tests. This file is just Python code and thus is very; flexible, but we've standardized it for the LLVM regression tests. If; you're adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from; another directory to ge",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:6978,test,tests,6978,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"
Testability,"pt without entering a ROOT; session. One simply adds the name of the script(s) after the ROOT; command. Be warned: after finishing the execution of the script,; ROOT will normally enter a new session. - -q process command line script files and exit. For example if you would like to run a script `myMacro.C` in the; background, redirect the output into a file `myMacro.log`, and exit; after the script execution, use the following syntax:. ```; root -b -q myMacro.C > myMacro.log; ```. If you need to pass a parameter to the script use:. ```; root -b -q 'myMacro.C(3)' > myMacro.log; ```. Be mindful of the quotes, i.e. if you need to pass a string as a; parameter, the syntax is:. ```; root -b -q 'myMacro.C(""text"")' > myMacro.log; ```. You can build a shared library with ACLiC and then use this shared; library on the command line for a quicker execution (i.e. the compiled; speed rather than the interpreted speed). See also ""Cling the C++; Interpreter"". ```; root -b -q myMacro.so > myMacro.log; ```. ROOT has a powerful C/C++ interpreter giving you access to all available; ROOT classes, global variables, and functions via the command line. By; typing C++ statements at the prompt, you can create objects, call; functions, execute scripts, etc. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] 1+sqrt(9); (const double)4.00000000000000000e+00; root[] for (int i = 0; i<4; i++) cout << ""Hello"" << i << endl; Hello 0; Hello 1; Hello 2; Hello 3; root[] .q; ```. To exit the ROOT session, type `.q`. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .q; ```. ## Using the GUI. The basic whiteboard on which an object is drawn in ROOT is called a; canvas (defined by the class **`TCanvas`**). Every object in the; canvas is a graphical object in the sense that you can grab it, resize; it, and change some characteristics using the mouse. The canvas area; can be divided in several sub areas, so-called pads; (the class **`TPad`**). A pad is a canvas sub area that can contain; other pads or graphical objects.

Testability,"put; sequences from the instruction scheduler. For example,. .. code-block:: llvm. ; CHECK-DAG: add [[REG1:r[0-9]+]], r1, r2; ; CHECK-DAG: add [[REG2:r[0-9]+]], r3, r4; ; CHECK: mul r5, [[REG1]], [[REG2]]. In this case, any order of that two ``add`` instructions will be allowed. If you are defining `and` using variables in the same ``CHECK-DAG:`` block,; be aware that the definition rule can match `after` its use. So, for instance, the code below will pass:. .. code-block:: text. ; CHECK-DAG: vmov.32 [[REG2:d[0-9]+]][0]; ; CHECK-DAG: vmov.32 [[REG2]][1]; vmov.32 d0[1]; vmov.32 d0[0]. While this other code, will not:. .. code-block:: text. ; CHECK-DAG: vmov.32 [[REG2:d[0-9]+]][0]; ; CHECK-DAG: vmov.32 [[REG2]][1]; vmov.32 d1[1]; vmov.32 d0[0]. While this can be very useful, it's also dangerous, because in the case of; register sequence, you must have a strong order (read before write, copy before; use, etc). If the definition your test is looking for doesn't match (because; of a bug in the compiler), it may match further away from the use, and mask; real bugs away. In those cases, to enforce the order, use a non-DAG directive between DAG-blocks. A ``CHECK-DAG:`` directive skips matches that overlap the matches of any; preceding ``CHECK-DAG:`` directives in the same ``CHECK-DAG:`` block. Not only; is this non-overlapping behavior consistent with other directives, but it's; also necessary to handle sets of non-unique strings or patterns. For example,; the following directives look for unordered log entries for two tasks in a; parallel program, such as the OpenMP runtime:. .. code-block:: text. // CHECK-DAG: [[THREAD_ID:[0-9]+]]: task_begin; // CHECK-DAG: [[THREAD_ID]]: task_end; //; // CHECK-DAG: [[THREAD_ID:[0-9]+]]: task_begin; // CHECK-DAG: [[THREAD_ID]]: task_end. The second pair of directives is guaranteed not to match the same log entries; as the first pair even though the patterns are identical and even if the text; of the log entries is identical because the th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:20200,test,test,20200,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,1,['test'],['test']

With all these inconsistencies, it was deemed safer to disable copy assignment; of RooAbsArgs from now on. ### RooBrowser: a graphical user interface for workspace exploration, visualization, and analysis. This experimental new feature utilises the technology from ROOT's familiar `TBrowser` in order to create an interface for graphically exploring and visualizing the content of a workspace, as well as perform basic fitting operations with the models and datasets. ![Demonstration of RooBrowser using json workspace from the roofit tutorials directory](RooBrowser.png). ### Removal of deprecated HistFactory functionality. #### Removal of HistoToWorkspaceFactory (non-Fast version). The original `HistoToWorkspaceFactory` produced models that consisted of a; Poisson term for each bin. In this ""number counting form"" the dataset has one; row and the collumns corresponded to the number of events for each bin. This; led to severe performance problems in statistical tools that generated; pseudo-experiments and evaluated likelihood ratio test statistics. Nowadays, everyone uses the faster `HistoToWorkspaceFactoryFast` implementation that; produces a model in the ""standard form"" where the dataset has one row for each; event, and the column corresponds to the value of the observable in the; histogram. Therefore, the original `HistoToWorkspaceFactory` is now removed to avoid; confusion and maintainance burden. #### Removing constant parameter flag from RooStats:HistFactory::NormFactor. As printed out by the HistFactory in a warning message for a long time already,; setting the `Const` attribute to the `<NormFactor>` tag is deprecated and it; will be ignored. Instead, add `<ParamSetting Const=""True""> myparam </ParamSetting>` to your top-level XML's `<Measurement>` entry.

If the PR contains performance-critical; code consider writing a benchmark against the [rootbench repository](https://github.com/root-project/rootbench). ## Quality Assurance. Each contribution should contain developer documentation in the form of code; comments and sufficient amount of tests in the form of unit and/or integration; tests. Unit tests are relatively small and quick programs focused to check if; small pieces of code and API work as expected. Integration tests are checks; which ensure the synergy between different (unit tested) components. Put in; practice, unit tests verify (member) function behavior whereas integration tests; check classes and their cooperation. The boundary between both kinds of testing; is blurred. ROOT has support for both kinds of tests in the [roottest repository](https://github.com/root-project/roottest); and supports ""inline"" unit tests in each component's `test` folder. Unit testing; uses the [GTest and GMock](https://github.com/google/googletest) infrastructure; along with small ROOT-specific extensions located in; [TestSupport](../core/test_support/). The documentation of GTest; and GMock is rather extensive and we will describe some of the features of; ROOT::TestSupport. In order to write an inline unit test, add a new file in the; nearest to the tested component's `test` folder and call `ROOT_ADD_GTEST` in the; `CMakeLists.txt` file. In many cases using standard GTest facility is sufficient to write a good test.; However, we disallow error messages in gtests, or sometimes we want to test the; error conditions of an interface and its diagnostics. For example,. ```cpp. void MyROOTFunc(unsigned x); {; if (x == 0) {; Error(""MyROOTFunc"", ""x should be greater than 0!"");; return;; }; /* some work */; }. ```.

Just convert each function to a number, and gather; all of them in a special hash-table. Functions with equal hashes are equal.; Good hashing means, that every function part must be taken into account. That; means we have to convert every function part into some number, and then add it; into the hash. The lookup-up time would be small, but such an approach adds some; delay due to the hashing routine. Logarithmical search; """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""; We could introduce total ordering among the functions set, once ordered we; could then implement a logarithmical search.

What was most; surprising is that logarithmical search was faster; sometimes by up to 15%. The; hashing method needs some extra CPU time, which is the main reason why it works; slower; in most cases, total ""hashing"" time is greater than total; ""logarithmical-search"" time. So, preference has been granted to the ""logarithmical search"". Though in the case of need, *logarithmical-search* (read ""total-ordering"") could; be used as a milestone on our way to the *random-access* implementation. Every comparison is based either on the numbers or on the flags comparison. In; the *random-access* approach, we could use the same comparison algorithm.; During comparison, we exit once we find the difference, but here we might have; to scan the whole function body every time (note, it could be slower). Like in; ""total-ordering"", we will track every number and flag, but instead of; comparison, we should get the numbers sequence and then create the hash number.; So, once again, *total-ordering* could be considered as a milestone for even; faster (i",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MergeFunctions.rst:6527,log,logarithmical,6527,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MergeFunctions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MergeFunctions.rst,1,['log'],['logarithmical']

We intentionally do not support public; libraries in the side repository, as we want to carefully review and; find good APIs for libraries as they are lifted out of a few tools and; into the core Clang library set.

When you add a popup menu to the menu; bar, a **`TGMenuTitle`** object is created by the menu bar. It is the; name of the popup menu. A menu title should have a one-word name that; reflects the purpose of all items within the corresponding popup menu.; It should also have a defined character as its unique access key.

Currently, C++ standard library functions are considered for inlining by; default. The standard library functions and the STL in particular are used ubiquitously; enough that our tolerance for false positives is even lower here.

Testability,"r6, [r5, r4]. The ``--enable-var-scope`` option has the same effect on numeric variables as; on string variables. Important note: In its current implementation, an expression cannot use a; numeric variable defined earlier in the same CHECK directive. FileCheck Pseudo Numeric Variables; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Sometimes there's a need to verify output that contains line numbers of the; match file, e.g. when testing compiler diagnostics. This introduces a certain; fragility of the match file structure, as ""``CHECK:``"" lines contain absolute; line numbers in the same file, which have to be updated whenever line numbers; change due to text addition or deletion. To support this case, FileCheck expressions understand the ``@LINE`` pseudo; numeric variable which evaluates to the line number of the CHECK pattern where; it is found. This way match patterns can be put near the relevant test lines and include; relative line number references, for example:. .. code-block:: c++. // CHECK: test.cpp:[[# @LINE + 4]]:6: error: expected ';' after top level declarator; // CHECK-NEXT: {{^int a}}; // CHECK-NEXT: {{^ \^}}; // CHECK-NEXT: {{^ ;}}; int a. To support legacy uses of ``@LINE`` as a special string variable,; :program:`FileCheck` also accepts the following uses of ``@LINE`` with string; substitution block syntax: ``[[@LINE]]``, ``[[@LINE+<offset>]]`` and; ``[[@LINE-<offset>]]`` without any spaces inside the brackets and where; ``offset`` is an integer. Matching Newline Characters; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. To match newline characters in regular expressions the character class; ``[[:space:]]`` can be used. For example, the following pattern:. .. code-block:: c++. // CHECK: DW_AT_location [DW_FORM_sec_offset] ([[DLOC:0x[0-9a-f]+]]){{[[:space:]].*}}""intd"". matches output of the form (from llvm-dwarfdump):. .. code-block:: text. DW_AT_location [DW_FORM_sec_offset] (0x00000233); DW_AT_name [DW_FORM_strp] ( .debug_str[0x000000c9] = ""intd""). letting us set the :program:",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:34313,test,test,34313,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"rV(""Unknown unary operator"");. return Builder->CreateCall(F, OperandV, ""unop"");; }. This code is similar to, but simpler than, the code for binary; operators. It is simpler primarily because it doesn't need to handle any; predefined operators. Kicking the Tires; =================. It is somewhat hard to believe, but with a few simple extensions we've; covered in the last chapters, we have grown a real-ish language. With; this, we can do a lot of interesting things, including I/O, math, and a; bunch of other things. For example, we can now add a nice sequencing; operator (printd is defined to print out the specified value and a; newline):. ::. ready> extern printd(x);; Read extern:; declare double @printd(double). ready> def binary : 1 (x y) 0; # Low-precedence operator that ignores operands.; ...; ready> printd(123) : printd(456) : printd(789);; 123.000000; 456.000000; 789.000000; Evaluated to 0.000000. We can also define a bunch of other ""primitive"" operations, such as:. ::. # Logical unary not.; def unary!(v); if v then; 0; else; 1;. # Unary negate.; def unary-(v); 0-v;. # Define > with the same precedence as <.; def binary> 10 (LHS RHS); RHS < LHS;. # Binary logical or, which does not short circuit.; def binary| 5 (LHS RHS); if LHS then; 1; else if RHS then; 1; else; 0;. # Binary logical and, which does not short circuit.; def binary& 6 (LHS RHS); if !LHS then; 0; else; !!RHS;. # Define = with slightly lower precedence than relationals.; def binary = 9 (LHS RHS); !(LHS < RHS | LHS > RHS);. # Define ':' for sequencing: as a low-precedence operator that ignores operands; # and just returns the RHS.; def binary : 1 (x y) y;.

Testability,"rage (MC/DC) is the percentage of individual; branch conditions that have been shown to independently affect the decision; outcome of the boolean expression they comprise.

MC/DC builds on top of branch coverage and; requires that all code blocks and all execution paths have been tested. This; statistic is hidden by default in reports, but it can be enabled via the; ``-show-mcdc-summary`` option as long as code was also compiled using the; clang option ``-fcoverage-mcdc``. * Boolean expressions that are only comprised of one condition (and therefore; have no logical operators) are not included in MC/DC analysis and are; trivially deducible using branch coverage. Of these six statistics, function coverage is usually the least granular while; branch coverage (with MC/DC) is the most granular. 100% branch coverage for a; function implies 100% region coverage for a function.

Testability,"ral notes on semantic analysis before we get into construction; of the AST:. * Your expression probably involves some types and some subexpressions.; Make sure to fully check that those types, and the types of those; subexpressions, meet your expectations. Add implicit conversions where; necessary to make sure that all of the types line up exactly the way you; want them. Write extensive tests to check that you're getting good; diagnostics for mistakes and that you can use various forms of; subexpressions with your expression.; * When type-checking a type or subexpression, make sure to first check; whether the type is ""dependent"" (``Type::isDependentType()``) or whether a; subexpression is type-dependent (``Expr::isTypeDependent()``). If any of; these return ``true``, then you're inside a template and you can't do much; type-checking now. That's normal, and your AST node (when you get there); will have to deal with this case. At this point, you can write tests that; use your expression within templates, but don't try to instantiate the; templates.; * For each subexpression, be sure to call ``Sema::CheckPlaceholderExpr()``; to deal with ""weird"" expressions that don't behave well as subexpressions.; Then, determine whether you need to perform lvalue-to-rvalue conversions; (``Sema::DefaultLvalueConversions``) or the usual unary conversions; (``Sema::UsualUnaryConversions``), for places where the subexpression is; producing a value you intend to use.; * Your ``BuildXXX`` function will probably just return ``ExprError()`` at; this point, since you don't have an AST. That's perfectly fine, and; shouldn't impact your testing. #. Introduce an AST node for your new expression. This starts with declaring; the node in ``include/Basic/StmtNodes.td`` and creating a new class for your; expression in the appropriate ``include/AST/Expr*.h`` header.

Testability,"ransformLayer, from; ``llvm/include/llvm/ExecutionEngine/Orc/IRTransformLayer.h`` and; ``llvm/lib/ExecutionEngine/Orc/IRTransformLayer.cpp``. This class is concerned; with two very simple jobs: (1) Running every IR Module that is emitted via this; layer through the transform function object, and (2) implementing the ORC; ``IRLayer`` interface (which itself conforms to the general ORC Layer concept,; more on that below). Most of the class is straightforward: a typedef for the; transform function, a constructor to initialize the members, a setter for the; transform function value, and a default no-op transform. The most important; method is ``emit`` as this is half of our IRLayer interface. The emit method; applies our transform to each module that it is called on and, if the transform; succeeds, passes the transformed module to the base layer. If the transform; fails, our emit function calls; ``MaterializationResponsibility::failMaterialization`` (this JIT clients who; may be waiting on other threads know that the code they were waiting for has; failed to compile) and logs the error with the execution session before bailing; out. The other half of the IRLayer interface we inherit unmodified from the IRLayer; class:. .. code-block:: c++.

This code, from ``llvm/lib/ExecutionEngine/Orc/Layer.cpp``, adds a; ThreadSafeModule to a given JITDylib by wrapping it up in a; ``MaterializationUnit`` (in this case a ``BasicIRLayerMaterializationUnit``).; Most layers that derived from IRLayer can rely on this default implementation; of the ``add`` method.

It's also heavily oriented towards processing; command line argument strings which is hard to do correctly, hence the large; amount of logic dedicated to that task in the Clang driver. While compatibility; with GNU would bring benefits, the cost in this case is deemed too high. Avoid re-inventing feature detection in the configuration; ---------------------------------------------------------. A large amount of logic in the Clang driver is dedicated to inferring which; architectural features are available based on the given command line options.; It is neither desirable nor practical to repeat such logic in each multilib; configuration. Instead the configuration should be able to benefit from the; heavy lifting Clang already does to detect features. Low maintenance; ---------------. Multilib is a relatively small feature in the scheme of things so supporting it; should accordingly take little time. Where possible this should be achieved by; implementing it in terms of existing features in the LLVM codebase. Minimal additional API surface; ------------------------------. The greater the API surface, the greater the difficulty of keeping it stable.; Where possible the additional API surface should be kept small by defining it; in relation to existing APIs. An example of this is keeping a simple; relationship between flag names and command line options where possible.; Since the command line options are part of a stable API they are unlikely; to change,",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Multilib.rst:12163,log,logic,12163,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Multilib.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Multilib.rst,1,['log'],['logic']

The next graphs show the two columns on the right which represent the split and; non-split **`TClonesArray`**, are significantly lower than the vectors. The most; significant difference is in reading a file without compression. The file size with compression, write times with and without compression; and the read times with and without compression all favor the; **`TClonesArray`**. ## Impact of Compression on I/O. This benchmark illustrates the pros and cons of the compression option.; We recommend using compression when the time spent in I/O is small; compared to the total processing time. In this case, if the I/O; operation is increased by a factor of 5 it is still a small percentage; of the total time and it may very well save a factor of 10 on disk; space. On the other hand if the time spend on I/O is large, compression; may slow down the program's performance. The standard test program; `$ROOTSYS/test/Event` was used in various configurations with 400; events. The data file contains a **`TTree`**. The program was invoked; with:. ``` {.cpp}; Event 400 comp split; ```. - comp = 0 means: no compression at all.; - comp = 1 means: compress everything if split = 0.; - comp = 1 means: compress only the tree branches with integers if; split = 1.; - comp = 2 means: compress everything if split=1.; - split = 0 : the full event is serialized into one single buffer.; - split = 1 : the event is split into branches. One branch for each; data member of the Event class. The list of tracks (a; **`TClonesArray`**) has the data members of the Track class also; split into individual buffers.

Since the release 5.10, SMatrix supports symmetric matrices using; a storage class (ROOT::Math::MatRepSym) which contains only the N*(N+1)/2 independent element; of a NxN symmetric matrix.; It is not in the mandate of this package to provide a complete linear algebra functionality; for these classes. What is provided are basic \ref MatrixFunctions and \ref VectFunction,; such as the matrix-matrix, matrix-vector, vector-vector operations, plus some extra; functionality for square matrices, like inversion, which is based on the optimized Cramer; method for squared matrices of size up to 6x6, and determinant calculation.; For a more detailed descriptions and usage examples see:. * \ref SVectorDoc; * \ref SMatrixDoc; * \ref MatVecFunctions. The SMatrix package contains only header files. Normally one does not need to build any library.; In the %ROOT distribution a library, _libSmatrix_ is produced with the C++ dictionary information; for vectors, symmetric and squared matrices for double, float types up to dimension 7.; The current version of SMatrix can be downloaded from [here](../SMatrix.tar.gz). If you want; to install the header files or run the test _configure_ script and then _make install_ or; _make check_ to build the tests. No dictionary library is built in this case. ## References. 1.

This is used for tests which; were specified as expected to fail, but are now succeeding (generally because; the feature they test was broken and has been fixed). **FAIL**. The test failed. **UNRESOLVED**. The test result could not be determined.

The test-suite contains benchmark and test programs. The programs come with; reference outputs so that their correctness can be checked. The suite comes; with tools to collect metrics such as benchmark runtime, compilation time and; code size. The test-suite is divided into several directories:. - `SingleSource/`. Contains test programs that are only a single source file in size. A; subdirectory may contain several programs. - `MultiSource/`. Contains subdirectories which entire programs with multiple source files.; Large benchmarks and whole applications go here. - `MicroBenchmarks/`. Programs using the [google-benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark); library. The programs define functions that are run multiple times until the; measurement results are statistically significant. - `External/`. Contains descriptions and test data for code that cannot be directly; distributed with the test-suite. The most prominent members of this; directory are the SPEC CPU benchmark suites.; See [External Suites](#external-suites). - `Bitcode/`. These tests are mostly written in LLVM bitcode. - `CTMark/`. Contains symbolic links to other benchmarks forming a representative sample; for compilation performance measurements. ### Benchmarks. Every program can work as a correctness test. Some programs are unsuitable for; performance measurements. Setting the `TEST_SUITE_BENCHMARKING_ONLY` CMake; option to `ON` will disable them. Configuration; -------------. The test-suite has configuration options to customize building and running the; benchmarks.

Testability,"re; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler. For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where the assertion condition; failed. This can lead to false positives, as the assertion condition usually; implies a safety condition (e.g., a pointer is not null) prior to performing; some action that depends on that condition (e.g., dereferencing a pointer).; The analyzer knows about several well-known assertion handlers, but can; automatically infer if a function should be treated as an assertion handler if; it is annotated with the 'noreturn' attribute or the (Clang-specific); 'analyzer_noreturn' attribute. Note that, currently, clang does not support; these attributes on Objective-C methods and C++ methods.; Attribute 'noreturn'; The 'noreturn' attribute is a GCC-attribute that can be placed on the; declarations of functions. It means exactly what its name implies: a function; with a 'noreturn' attribute should never return.; Specific details of the syntax of using the 'noreturn' attribute can be found; in GCC's; documentation.; Not only does the analyzer exploit this information when pruning false paths,; but the compiler also takes it seriously and will generate d",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html:21299,assert,assertion,21299,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/annotations.html,1,['assert'],['assertion']

Testability,"read before the referenced; object, it is null and may cause a run time system error. To address; these limitations, ROOT offers the **`TRef`** class. **`TRef`** allows referencing an object in a different branch and/or in; a different file. **`TRef`** also supports the complex situation where a; **`TFile`** is updated multiple times on the same machine or a different; machine. When a **`TRef`** is read before its referenced object, it is; null. As soon as the referenced object is read, the **`TRef`** points to; it. In addition, one can specify an action to be taken by **`TRef`** in; the case it is read before its reference object (see""Action on Demand""; below). ### Using TRef. A **`TRef`** is a lightweight object pointing to any **`TObject`**. This; object can be used instead of normal C++ pointers in case:. - The referenced object R and the pointer P are not written to the; same file. - P is read before R. - R and P are written to different Tree branches. Below is a line from the example in `$ROOTSYS/test/Event.cxx.`. ``` {.cpp}; TRef fLastTrack; //pointer to last track; ...; Track *track = (Track*)fTracks->ConstructedAt(fNtrack++);; track->Set(random);; // Save reference to last Track in the collection of Tracks; fLastTrack = track;; ```. The `track` and its reference `fLastTrack` can be written with two; separate I/O calls in the same or in different files, in the same or in; different branches of a **`TTree`**. If the **`TRef`** is read and the; referenced object has not yet been read, **`TRef`** will return a null; pointer. As soon as the referenced object will be read, **`TRef`** will; point to it. ### How Does It Work?. A **`TRef`** is itself a **`TObject`** with an additional transient; pointer `fPID`. When a **`TRef`** is used to point to a; **`TObject`**` *R`, for example in a class with. ``` {.cpp}; TRef P;; ```. one can do:. ``` {.cpp}; P = R; //to set the pointer; ```. When the statement `P = R `is executed, the following happens:. - The pointer `fPID`",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md:58254,test,test,58254,documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/InputOutput.md,1,['test'],['test']

This function implements a very simple parser for the kinds of strings we are; interested in. Although it has some holes (it allows ""``123KKK``"" for example),; it is good enough for this example. Note that we use the option itself to print; out the error message (the ``error`` method always returns true) in order to get; a nice error message (shown below). Now that we have our parser class, we can; use it like this:. .. code-block:: c++. static cl::opt<unsigned, false, FileSizeParser>; MFS(""max-file-size"", cl::desc(""Maximum file size to accept""),; cl::value_desc(""size""));. Which adds this to the output of our program:. ::. OPTIONS:; -help - display available options (-help-hidden for more); ...; -max-file-size=<size> - Maximum file size to accept. And we can test that our parse works correctly now (the test program just prints; out the max-file-size argument value):. ::. $ ./test; MFS: 0; $ ./test -max-file-size=123MB; MFS: 128974848; $ ./test -max-file-size=3G; MFS: 3221225472; $ ./test -max-file-size=dog; -max-file-size option: 'dog' value invalid for file size argument!. It looks like it works. The error message that we get is nice and helpful, and; we seem to accept reasonable file sizes. This wraps up the ""custom parser""; tutorial. Exploiting external storage; ---------------------------. Several of the LLVM libraries define static ``cl::opt`` instances that will; automatically be included in any program that links with that library. This is; a feature. However, sometimes it is necessary to know the value of the command; line option outside of the library. In these cases the library does or should; provide an external storage location that is accessible to users of the; library. Examples of this include the ``llvm::DebugFlag`` exported by the; ``lib/Support/Debug.cpp`` file and the ``llvm::TimePassesIsEnabled`` flag; exported by the ``lib/IR/PassManager.cpp``",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst:66065,test,test,66065,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandLine.rst,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"recommend using ASan over GWP-ASan in testing, as well as anywhere; else that guaranteed error detection is more valuable than the 2x execution; slowdown/binary size bloat. For the majority of production environments, this; impact is too high, and GWP-ASan proves extremely useful. Design; ======. **Please note:** The implementation of GWP-ASan is largely in-flux, and these; details are subject to change. There are currently other implementations of; GWP-ASan, such as the implementation featured in; `Chromium <https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/gwp_asan/>`_. The; long-term support goal is to ensure feature-parity where reasonable, and to; support compiler-rt as the reference implementation. Allocator Support; -----------------. GWP-ASan is not a replacement for a traditional allocator. Instead, it works by; inserting stubs into a supporting allocator to redirect allocations to GWP-ASan; when they're chosen to be sampled. These stubs are generally implemented in the; implementation of ``malloc()``, ``free()`` and ``realloc()``. The stubs are; extremely small, which makes using GWP-ASan in most allocators fairly trivial.; The stubs follow the same general pattern (example ``malloc()`` pseudocode; below):. .. code:: cpp. #ifdef INSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS; gwp_asan::GuardedPoolAllocator GWPASanAllocator;; #endif. void* YourAllocator::malloc(..) {; #ifdef INSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS; if (GWPASanAllocator.shouldSample(..)); return GWPASanAllocator.allocate(..);; #endif. // ... the rest of your allocator code here.; }. Then, all the supporting allocator needs to do is compile with; ``-DINSTALL_GWP_ASAN_STUBS`` and link against the GWP-ASan library! For; performance reasons, we strongly recommend static linkage of the GWP-ASan; library. Guarded Allocation Pool; -----------------------. The core of GWP-ASan is the guarded allocation pool. Each sampled allocation is; backed using its own *guarded* slot, which may consist of one or more accessible; pages. Each guarded slot ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GwpAsan.rst:2328,stub,stubs,2328,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GwpAsan.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GwpAsan.rst,1,['stub'],['stubs']
Testability,"recursion and error handling. One interesting aspect of this is; that it uses *look-ahead* to determine if the current identifier is a; stand alone variable reference or if it is a function call expression.; It handles this by checking to see if the token after the identifier is; a '(' token, constructing either a ``VariableExprAST`` or; ``CallExprAST`` node as appropriate. Now that we have all of our simple expression-parsing logic in place, we; can define a helper function to wrap it together into one entry point.; We call this class of expressions ""primary"" expressions, for reasons; that will become more clear `later in the; tutorial <LangImpl06.html#user-defined-unary-operators>`_. In order to parse an arbitrary; primary expression, we need to determine what sort of expression it is:. .. code-block:: c++. /// primary; /// ::= identifierexpr; /// ::= numberexpr; /// ::= parenexpr; static std::unique_ptr<ExprAST> ParsePrimary() {; switch (CurTok) {; default:; return LogError(""unknown token when expecting an expression"");; case tok_identifier:; return ParseIdentifierExpr();; case tok_number:; return ParseNumberExpr();; case '(':; return ParseParenExpr();; }; }. Now that you see the definition of this function, it is more obvious why; we can assume the state of CurTok in the various functions. This uses; look-ahead to determine which sort of expression is being inspected, and; then parses it with a function call. Now that basic expressions are handled, we need to handle binary; expressions. They are a bit more complex. Binary Expression Parsing; =========================. Binary expressions are significantly harder to parse because they are; often ambiguous. For example, when given the string ""x+y\*z"", the parser; can choose to parse it as either ""(x+y)\*z"" or ""x+(y\*z)"". With common; definitions from mathematics, we expect the later parse, because ""\*""; (multiplication) has higher *precedence* than ""+"" (addition). There are many ways to handle this, but an elegant ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst:11488,Log,LogError,11488,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst,1,['Log'],['LogError']

Extract logic into a separate file** Implement what your class is; supposed to do as a free function in [MathFuncs].; This implementation must be compatible with the syntax supported by Clad. **2. Refactor evaluate():** Refactor the existing `RooAbsReal::evaluate()`; function to use the `MathFuncs.h` implementation. This is optional, but; can reduce code duplication and potential for bugs. This may require some; effort if an extensive caching infrastructure is used in your model. **3. Add translate():** RooFit classes are extended using a (typically) simple; `translate()` function that extracts the mathematically differentiable; properties out of the RooFit classes that make up the statistical model. The `translate()` function helps implement the Code Squashing logic that is; used to optimize numerical evaluations. It accomplishes this by using a small; subset of helper functions that are available in the; `RooFit::Detail::CodeSquashContext` and `RooFuncWrapper` classes; (see Appendix B). It converts a RooFit expression into a form that can be; efficiently evaluated by Clad. The `translate()` function returns an `std::string` representing the; underlying mathematical notation of the class as code, that can later be; concatenated into a single string representing the entire model. This string; of code is then just-in-time compiled by Cling (a C++ interpreter for Root). **4. analyticalIntegral() Use Case:** If your class includes (or should; include) the `analyticalIntegral()` function, then a simple; `buildCallToAnalyticIntegral()` function needs to be created to help call the; `analyticalIntegral()` function. # Example for adding Code Generation support to RooFit classes.

""More Canonical"" Loops; ======================. .. _loop-terminology-loop-rotate:. Rotated Loops; -------------. Loops are rotated by the LoopRotate (:ref:`loop-rotate <passes-loop-rotate>`); pass, which converts loops into do/while style loops and is; implemented in; `LoopRotation.h <https://llvm.org/doxygen/LoopRotation_8h_source.html>`_. Example:. .. code-block:: C. void test(int n) {; for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 1); // Loop body; }. is transformed to:. .. code-block:: C. void test(int n) {; int i = 0;; do {; // Loop body; i += 1;; } while (i < n);; }. **Warning**: This transformation is valid only if the compiler; can prove that the loop body will be executed at least once. Otherwise,; it has to insert a guard which will test it at runtime. In the example; above, that would be:. .. code-block:: C. void test(int n) {; int i = 0;; if (n > 0) {; do {; // Loop body; i += 1;; } while (i < n);; }; }. It's important to understand the effect of loop rotation; at the LLVM IR level. We follow with the previous examples; in LLVM IR while also providing a graphical representation; of the control-flow graphs (CFG). You can get the same graphical; results by utilizing the :ref:`view-cfg <passes-view-cfg>` pass.

Somewhat better is running ``gmake TEST=sometest test``, which runs the; specified test and usually adds per-program summaries to the output; (depending on which sometest you use). For example, the ``nightly`` test; explicitly outputs TEST-PASS or TEST-FAIL for every test after each; program. Though these lines are still drowned in the output, it's easy; to grep the output logs in the Output directories. Even better are the ``report`` and ``report.format`` targets (where; ``format`` is one of ``html``, ``csv``, ``text`` or ``graphs``).

At; base, this is how the nightly tester works, it's just one example of a; general framework. Lets say that you have an LLVM optimization pass, and you want to see; how many times it triggers.

Following this, you can set up a test and a report that collects these; and formats them for easy viewing.

In this example, the `RooNLLVarNew::translate()` function generates code to; compute the Negative Log likelihood (NLL). We can see that the intermediate; result variable `resName` is added to the context so that it can be accessed; and used in the generated code. This variable is made available globally; (using `addToGlobalScope()`). If a weight sum is needed, then it creates a loop, and `weightSumName` is; accumulated with the weight variable. Otherwise, if there are multiple; simultaneous PDFs, then it adds a term to the result that scales with the; logarithm of the count of simultaneous PDFs. The rest of the function body; (including the loop scope with NLL computation) has omitted from this example; to keep it brief.

Testability,"ression tests; ----------------------------. The regression test structure is very simple, but does require some; information to be set. This information is gathered via ``cmake``; and is written to a file, ``test/lit.site.cfg.py`` in the build directory.; The ``llvm/test`` Makefile does this work for you. In order for the regression tests to work, each directory of tests must; have a ``lit.local.cfg`` file. :program:`lit` looks for this file to determine; how to run the tests. This file is just Python code and thus is very; flexible, but we've standardized it for the LLVM regression tests. If; you're adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from; another directory to get running. The standard ``lit.local.cfg`` simply; specifies which files to look in for tests. Any directory that contains; only directories does not need the ``lit.local.cfg`` file. Read the :doc:`Lit; documentation <CommandGuide/lit>` for more information. Each test file must contain lines starting with ""RUN:"" that tell :program:`lit`; how to run it. If there are no RUN lines, :program:`lit` will issue an error; while running a test. RUN lines are specified in the comments of the test program using the; keyword ``RUN`` followed by a colon, and lastly the command (pipeline); to execute. Together, these lines form the ""script"" that :program:`lit`; executes to run the test case. The syntax of the RUN lines is similar to a; shell's syntax for pipelines including I/O redirection and variable; substitution. However, even though these lines may *look* like a shell; script, they are not. RUN lines are interpreted by :program:`lit`.; Consequently, the syntax differs from shell in a few ways. You can specify; as many RUN lines as needed. :program:`lit` performs substitution on each RUN line to replace LLVM tool names; with the full paths to the executable built for each tool (in; ``$(LLVM_OBJ_ROOT)/bin``).

These files serve as both a marker of test suites; and as configuration files which :program:`lit` loads in order to understand; how to find and run the tests inside the test suite. Once :program:`lit` has mapped the inputs into test suites it traverses the; list of inputs adding tests for individual files and recursively searching for; tests in directories. This behavior makes it easy to specify a subset of tests to run, while still; allowing the test suite configuration to control exactly how tests are; interpreted. In addition, :program:`lit` always identifies tests by the test; suite they are in, and their relative path inside the test suite. For; appropriately configured projects, this allows :program:`lit` to provide; convenient and flexible support for out-",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst:11295,test,test,11295,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/lit.rst,2,['test'],['test']

Currently the MIR format has several limitations in terms of which state it; can serialize:. - The target-specific state in the target-specific ``MachineFunctionInfo``; subclasses isn't serialized at the moment. - The target-specific ``MachineConstantPoolValue`` subclasses (in the ARM and; SystemZ backends) aren't serialized at the moment. - The ``MCSymbol`` machine operands don't support temporary or local symbols. - A lot of the state in ``MachineModuleInfo`` isn't serialized - only the CFI; instructions and the variable debug information from MMI is serialized right; now. These limitations impose restrictions on what you can test with the MIR format.; For now, tests that would like to test some behaviour that depends on the state; of temporary or local ``MCSymbol`` operands or the exception handling state in; MMI, can't use the MIR format. As well as that, tests that test some behaviour; that depends on the state of the target specific ``MachineFunctionInfo`` or; ``MachineConstantPoolValue`` subclasses can't use the MIR format at the moment.

Hence you should not try to make any; assumptions about what the viewer did with the object. The viewer may; decide to force the client to rebuild (republish) the scene, obtaining a; different collection of objects, if the internal viewer state changes; .e.g. significant camera move. It does this presently by forcing a; repaint on the attached **`TPad`** object - hence you should attach you; master geometry object to the pad (via `TObject::Draw()`), and perform; the publishing to the viewer in response to **`TObject::Paint()`**. #### Physical IDs. TVirtualViewer3D provides for two methods of object addition:. ``` {.cpp}; virtual Int_t AddObject(const TBuffer3D &buffer,; Bool_t * addChildren = 0); virtual Int_t AddObject(UInt_t physicalID,; const TBuffer3D & buffer,; Bool_t *addChildren = 0); ```.

Default values for these options are auto.; `freetype` finds `libpng` and `libbzip2` on the system and builds extra; modules. Then attempting to link against `freetype` one would need to link; `-lpng -lbzip2` explicitly otherwise linking will returns in undefined; references. Otherwise we would need to check for `libpng` and `libbzip2` on the system; and adjust `FREETYPE_LIBRARIES` to include `-lpng` and `-lbzip2`.; The current solution goes for the minimal configuration.

Code reviewers are encouraged to request a release note if they think one is; warranted when performing a code review. Quality; -------. The minimum quality standards that any change must satisfy before being; committed to the main development branch are:. #. Code must adhere to the `LLVM Coding Standards <CodingStandards.html>`_. #. Code must compile cleanly (no errors, no warnings) on at least one platform. #. Bug fixes and new features should `include a testcase`_ so we know if the; fix/feature ever regresses in the future. #. Code must pass the ``llvm/test`` test suite. #. The code must not cause regressions on a reasonable subset of llvm-test,; where ""reasonable"" depends on the contributor's judgement and the scope of; the change (more invasive changes require more testing). A reasonable subset; might be something like ""``llvm-test/MultiSource/Benchmarks``"". #. Ensure that links in source code and test files point to publicly available; resources and are used primarily to add additional information rather than; to supply critical context. The surrounding comments should be sufficient; to provide the context behind such links. Additionally, the committer is responsible for addressing any problems found in; the future that the change is responsible for.

Others always require a; tessellation description based on **`TBuffer3D`**'s `kRaw` /; `kRawSizes` points/lines/segments sections. - Some need the 3D object positions in the master (world) frame,; others can cope with local frames and a translation matrix to place; the object. - Some require bounding boxes for objects - others do not. Similarly some viewer clients are only capable of providing positions in; master frame, cannot provide bounding boxes etc. Additionally we do not; want to incur the cost of expensive tessellation operations if the; viewer does not require them. To cope with these variations the; **`TBuffer3D`** objects are filled by negotiation with the viewer. ![TBuffer3D class hierarchy](pictures/030000E0.png). **`TBuffer3D`** classes are conceptually divided into enumerated; sections: `kCore`, `kBoundingBox`, `kRaw` - see the class diagram and; the file `TBuffer3D.h` for more details. The **`TBuffer3D`** methods; `SectionsValid()`, `SetSectionsValid()`, `ClearSectionsValid()` are used; to test, set, clear these section validity flags e.g. ``` {.cpp}; buffer.SetSectionsValid(TBuffer3D::kShapeSpecific);; ...; if (buffer.SectionsValid(TBuffer3D:: kShapeSpecific)) {; ...; }; ```.

This enables a viewer, which knows how to draw (tessellate) the; shape itself to do so, while providing a generic fallback suitable for; all viewers. The rules for client negotiation with the viewer are:. - If suitable specialized **`TBuffer3D`** class exists, use it,; otherwise use **`TBuffer3D`**. - Complete the mandatory `kCore` section. - Complete the `kShapeSpecific` section if applicable. - Complete the `kBoundingBox` if you can. - Pa",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md:127482,test,test,127482,documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"riting; your RUN lines. In general nothing needs to be quoted. :program:`lit` won't; strip off any quote characters so they will get passed to the invoked program.; To avoid this use curly braces to tell :program:`lit` that it should treat; everything enclosed as one value. In general, you should strive to keep your RUN lines as simple as possible,; using them only to run tools that generate textual output you can then examine.; The recommended way to examine output to figure out if the test passes is using; the :doc:`FileCheck tool <CommandGuide/FileCheck>`. *[The usage of grep in RUN; lines is deprecated - please do not send or commit patches that use it.]*. Put related tests into a single file rather than having a separate file per; test. Check if there are files already covering your feature and consider; adding your code there instead of creating a new file. Generating assertions in regression tests; -----------------------------------------. Some regression test cases are very large and complex to write/update by hand.; In that case to reduce the human work we can use the scripts available in; llvm/utils/ to generate the assertions. For example to generate assertions in an :program:`llc`-based test, after; adding one or more RUN lines use:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc test.ll. This will generate FileCheck assertions, and insert a ``NOTE:`` line at the; top to indicate that assertions were automatically generated. If you want to update assertions in an existing test case, pass the `-u` option; which first checks the ``NOTE:`` line exists and matches the script name.

Throughput speeds are provided as compressed and uncompressed - ROOT files are usually; saved in compressed format, so these will often differ. Compressed bytes is the total; number of bytes read from TFiles during the readspeed test (possibly including meta-data).; Uncompressed bytes is the number of bytes processed by reading the branch values in the TTree.; Throughput is calculated as the total number of bytes over the total runtime (including; decompression time) in the uncompressed and compressed cases. ## Interpreting results:. ### There are three possible scenarios when using rootreadspeed, namely:. - The 'Real Time' is significantly lower than your own analysis runtime.; This would imply your actual application code is dominating the runtime of your analysis,; ie. your analysis logic or framework is taking up the time.; The best way to decrease the runtime would be to optimize your code (or the framework's),; parallelize it onto multiple threads if possible (for example with; [RDataFrame](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html); and [EnableImplicitMT](https://root.cern/doc/master/namespaceROOT.html#a06f2b8b216b615e5abbc872c9feff40f)); or switch to a machine with a more performant CPU.; - The 'Real Time' is significantly higher than 'CPU Time / number of threads'*.; If the real time is higher than the CPU time per core it implies the reading of data is the; bottleneck, as the CPU cores are wasting time waiting for data to arrive from your disk/drive; or network connection in order to decompress it.; The best way to decrease your runtime would be transferring the data you need onto a faster; storage medium (ie. a faster disk/drive such as an SSD, or connecting to a faster network; for remote file access), or to use a compression algorithm with a higher co",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/readspeed/README.md:1228,log,logic,1228,tree/readspeed/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/readspeed/README.md,1,['log'],['logic']

Additionally, the committer is responsible for addressing any problems found in; the future that the change is responsible for. For example:. * The code should compile cleanly on all supported platforms. * The changes should not cause any correctness regressions in the ``llvm-test``; suite and must not cause any major performance regressions. * The change set should not cause performance or correctness regressions for the; LLVM tools. * The changes should not cause performance or correctness regressions in code; compiled by LLVM on all applicable targets. * You are expected to address any `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues>`_ that; result from your change.

Error handling; --------------. Proper error handling helps us identify bugs in our code, and helps end-users; understand errors in their tool usage. Errors fall into two broad categories:; *programmatic* and *recoverable*, with different strategies for handling and; reporting. Programmatic Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Programmatic errors are violations of program invariants or API contracts, and; represent bugs within the program itself. Our aim is to document invariants, and; to abort quickly at the point of failure (providing some basic diagnostic) when; invariants are broken at runtime. The fundamental tools for handling programmatic errors are assertions and the; llvm_unreachable function. Assertions are used to express invariant conditions,; and should include a message describing the invariant:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(isPhysReg(R) && ""All virt regs should have been allocated already."");. The llvm_unreachable function can be used to document areas of control flow; that should never be entered if the program invariants hold:. .. code-block:: c++. enum { Foo, Bar, Baz } X = foo();. switch (X) {; case Foo: /* Handle Foo */; break;; case Bar: /* Handle Bar */; break;; default:; llvm_unreachable(""X should be Foo or Bar here"");; }. Recoverable Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Recoverable errors represent an error in the program's environment, for example; a resource failure (a missing file, a dropped network connection, etc.), or; malformed input. These errors should be detected and communicated to a level of; the program where they can be handled appropriately. Handling the error may be; as simple as reporting the issue t",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:16972,assert,assertions,16972,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['assert'],['assertions']

For example, according to the C standard the behavior of function; ``int isalnum(int ch)`` is undefined if the value of ``ch`` is not representable; as ``unsigned char`` and is not equal to ``EOF``. You can think of this checker as defining restrictions (pre- and postconditions); on standard library functions. Preconditions are checked, and when they are; violated, a warning is emitted. Postconditions are added to the analysis, e.g.; that the return value of a function is not greater than 255. Preconditions are; added to the analysis too, in the case when the affected values are not known; before the call. For example, if an argument to a function must be in between 0 and 255, but the; value of the argument is unknown, the analyzer will assume that it is in this; interval.

This has a few issues, the main one being that some compilers might not; understand the assertion, or warn about a missing return in builds where; assertions are compiled out. Today, we have something much better: ``llvm_unreachable``:. .. code-block:: c++. llvm_unreachable(""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. When assertions are enabled, this will print the message if it's ever reached; and then exit the program. When assertions are disabled (i.e. in release; builds), ``llvm_unreachable`` becomes a hint to compilers to skip generating; code for this branch. If the compiler does not support this, it will fall back; to the ""abort"" implementation. Use ``llvm_unreachable`` to mark a specific point in code that should never be; reached. This is especially desirable for addressing warnings about unreachable; branches, etc., but can be used whenever reaching a particular code path is; unconditionally a bug (not originating from user input; see below) of some kind.; Use of ``assert`` should always include a testable predicate (as opposed to; ``assert(false)``). If the error condition can be triggered by user input then the; recoverable error mechanism described in :doc:`ProgrammersManual` should be; used instead. In cases where this is not practical, ``report_fatal_error`` may; be used. Another issue is that values used only by assertions will produ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst:46733,assert,assertions,46733,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodingStandards.rst,1,['assert'],['assertions']

If parsing and codegen succeed, the next step is to add the module containing; the top-level expression to the JIT. We do this by calling addModule, which; triggers code generation for all the functions in the module, and accepts a; ``ResourceTracker`` which can be used to remove the module from the JIT later. Once the module; has been added to the JIT it can no longer be modified, so we also open a new; module to hold subsequent code by calling ``InitializeModuleAndPassManager()``. Once we've added the module to the JIT we need to get a pointer to the final; generated code. We do this by calling the JIT's ``lookup`` method, and passing; the name of the top-level expression function: ``__anon_expr``. Since we just; added this function, we assert that ``lookup`` returned a result. Next, we get the in-memory address of the ``__anon_expr`` function by calling; ``getAddress()`` on the symbol. Recall that we compile top-level expressions; into a self-contained LLVM function that takes no arguments and returns the; computed double. Because the LLVM JIT compiler matches the native platform ABI,; this means that you can just cast the result pointer to a function pointer of; that type and call it directly. This means, there is no difference between JIT; compiled code and native machine code that is statically linked into your; application. Finally, since we don't support re-evaluation of top-level expressions, we; remove the module from the JIT when we're done to free the associated memory.; Recall, however, that the module we created a few lines earlier (via; ``InitializeModuleAndPassManager``) is still open and waiting for new code to be; added.

We collected; data both with an `lfence`-based mitigation and load hardening as presented; here. The summary is that mitigating with load hardening is 1.77x faster than; mitigating with `lfence`, and the overhead of load hardening compared to a; normal program is likely between a 10% overhead and a 50% overhead with most; large applications seeing a 30% overhead or less. | Benchmark | `lfence` | Load Hardening | Mitigated Speedup |; | -------------------------------------- | -------: | -------------: | ----------------: |; | Google microbenchmark suite | -74.8% | -36.4% | **2.5x** |; | Large server QPS (using ThinLTO & PGO) | -62% | -29% | **1.8x** |.

Discard value names when generating LLVM IR. .. option:: -fno-discard-value-names. Do not discard value names when generating LLVM IR. This option can be used; to re-enable names for release builds of Clang. Comment Parsing Options; -----------------------. Clang parses Doxygen and non-Doxygen style documentation comments and attaches; them to the appropriate declaration nodes. By default, it only parses; Doxygen-style comments and ignores ordinary comments starting with ``//`` and; ``/*``. .. option:: -Wdocumentation. Emit warnings about use of documentation comments. This warning group is off; by default. This includes checking that ``\param`` commands name parameters that actually; present in the function signature, checking that ``\returns`` is used only on; functions that actually return a value etc",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:127867,assert,assertion-enabled,127867,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['assert'],['assertion-enabled']

SYNOPSIS; ^^^^^^^^. :program:`llvm-profdata overlap` [*options*] [*base profile file*] [*test profile file*]. DESCRIPTION; ^^^^^^^^^^^. :program:`llvm-profdata overlap` takes two profile data files and displays the; *overlap* of counter distribution between the whole files and between any of the; specified functions. In this command, *overlap* is defined as follows:; Suppose *base profile file* has the following counts:; {c1_1, c1_2, ..., c1_n, c1_u_1, c2_u_2, ..., c2_u_s},; and *test profile file* has; {c2_1, c2_2, ..., c2_n, c2_v_1, c2_v_2, ..., c2_v_t}.; Here c{1|2}_i (i = 1 .. n) are matched counters and c1_u_i (i = 1 .. s) and; c2_v_i (i = 1 .. v) are unmatched counters (or counters only existing in); *base profile file* and *test profile file*, respectively.; Let sum_1 = c1_1 + c1_2 + ... + c1_n + c1_u_1 + c2_u_2 + ... + c2_u_s, and; sum_2 = c2_1 + c2_2 + ... + c2_n + c2_v_1 + c2_v_2 + ... + c2_v_t.; *overlap* = min(c1_1/sum_1, c2_1/sum_2) + min(c1_2/sum_1, c2_2/sum_2) + ...; + min(c1_n/sum_1, c2_n/sum_2). The result overlap distribution is a percentage number, ranging from 0.0% to; 100.0%, where 0.0% means there is no overlap and 100.0% means a perfect; overlap. Here is an example, if *base profile file* has counts of {400, 600}, and; *test profile file* has matched counts of {60000, 40000}. The *overlap* is 80%.

Testability,"rogram tests; serve as a way of benchmarking LLVM performance, both in terms of the; efficiency of the programs generated as well as the speed with which; LLVM compiles, optimizes, and generates code. The test-suite is located in the ``test-suite``; `repository on GitHub <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git>`_. See the :doc:`TestSuiteGuide` for details. Debugging Information tests; ---------------------------. The test suite contains tests to check quality of debugging information.; The test are written in C based languages or in LLVM assembly language. These tests are compiled and run under a debugger. The debugger output; is checked to validate of debugging information. See README.txt in the; test suite for more information. This test suite is located in the; ``cross-project-tests/debuginfo-tests`` directory. Quick start; ===========. The tests are located in two separate repositories. The unit and; regression tests are in the main ""llvm""/ directory under the directories; ``llvm/unittests`` and ``llvm/test`` (so you get these tests for free with the; main LLVM tree). Use ``make check-all`` to run the unit and regression tests; after building LLVM. The ``test-suite`` module contains more comprehensive tests including whole C; and C++ programs. See the :doc:`TestSuiteGuide` for details. Unit and Regression tests; -------------------------. To run all of the LLVM unit tests use the check-llvm-unit target:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-llvm-unit. To run all of the LLVM regression tests use the check-llvm target:. .. code-block:: bash. % make check-llvm. In order to get reasonable testing performance, build LLVM and subprojects; in release mode, i.e. .. code-block:: bash. % cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=""Release"" -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=On.

Testability,"rogram. This document specifies how to correctly update debug info in various kinds of; code transformations, and offers suggestions for how to create targeted debug; info tests for arbitrary transformations. For more on the philosophy behind LLVM debugging information, see; :doc:`SourceLevelDebugging`. Rules for updating debug locations; ==================================. .. _WhenToPreserveLocation:. When to preserve an instruction location; ----------------------------------------. A transformation should preserve the debug location of an instruction if the; instruction either remains in its basic block, or if its basic block is folded; into a predecessor that branches unconditionally. The APIs to use are; ``IRBuilder``, or ``Instruction::setDebugLoc``. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that common block-local optimizations; preserve the ability to set breakpoints on source locations corresponding to; the instructions they touch. Debugging, crash logs, and SamplePGO accuracy; would be severely impacted if that ability were lost. Examples of transformations that should follow this rule include:. * Instruction scheduling. Block-local instruction reordering should not drop; source locations, even though this may lead to jumpy single-stepping; behavior. * Simple jump threading. For example, if block ``B1`` unconditionally jumps to; ``B2``, *and* is its unique predecessor, instructions from ``B2`` can be; hoisted into ``B1``. Source locations from ``B2`` should be preserved. * Peephole optimizations that replace or expand an instruction, like ``(add X; X) => (shl X 1)``. The location of the ``shl`` instruction should be the same; as the location of the ``add`` instruction. * Tail duplication. For example, if blocks ``B1`` and ``B2`` both; unconditionally branch to ``B3`` and ``B3`` can be folded into its; predecessors, source locations from ``B3`` should be preserved. Examples of transformations for which this rule *does not* apply include:. * LICM.

Release Qualification Criteria; ------------------------------. There are no official release qualification criteria. It is up to the; the release manager to determine when a release is ready. The release manager; should pay attention to the results of community testing, the number of outstanding; bugs, and then number of regressions when determining whether or not to make a; release. The community values time based releases, so releases should not be delayed for; too long unless there are critical issues remaining. In most cases, the only; kind of bugs that are critical enough to block a release would be a major regression; from a previous release. Official Testing; ----------------. A few developers in the community have dedicated time to validate the release; candidates and volunteered to be the official release testers for each; architecture. These will be the ones testing, generating and uploading the official binaries; to the server, and will be the minimum tests *necessary* for the release to; proceed. This will obviously not cover all OSs and distributions, so additional community; validation is important.

There is one other key difference between regular reexports and lazy reexports; that some clients must be aware of: The address of a lazy reexport will be; *different* from the address of the reexported symbol (whereas a regular; reexport is guaranteed to have the same address as the reexported symbol).; Clients who care about pointer equality will generally want to use the address; of the reexport as the canonical address of the reexported symbol. This will; allow the address to be taken without forcing materialization of the reexport. Usage example:.

Testability,"rses a line, then invokes a method on MCStreamer. In; the code generator, the `Code Emission`_ phase of the code generator lowers; higher level LLVM IR and Machine* constructs down to the MC layer, emitting; directives through MCStreamer. On the implementation side of MCStreamer, there are two major implementations:; one for writing out a .s file (MCAsmStreamer), and one for writing out a .o; file (MCObjectStreamer). MCAsmStreamer is a straightforward implementation; that prints out a directive for each method (e.g. ``EmitValue -> .byte``), but; MCObjectStreamer implements a full assembler. For target specific directives, the MCStreamer has a MCTargetStreamer instance.; Each target that needs it defines a class that inherits from it and is a lot; like MCStreamer itself: It has one method per directive and two classes that; inherit from it, a target object streamer and a target asm streamer. The target; asm streamer just prints it (``emitFnStart -> .fnstart``), and the object; streamer implement the assembler logic for it. To make llvm use these classes, the target initialization must call; TargetRegistry::RegisterAsmStreamer and TargetRegistry::RegisterMCObjectStreamer; passing callbacks that allocate the corresponding target streamer and pass it; to createAsmStreamer or to the appropriate object streamer constructor. The ``MCContext`` class; -----------------------. The MCContext class is the owner of a variety of uniqued data structures at the; MC layer, including symbols, sections, etc. As such, this is the class that you; interact with to create symbols and sections. This class can not be subclassed. The ``MCSymbol`` class; ----------------------. The MCSymbol class represents a symbol (aka label) in the assembly file. There; are two interesting kinds of symbols: assembler temporary symbols, and normal; symbols. Assembler temporary symbols are used and processed by the assembler; but are discarded when the object file is produced.

Writing Custom Tests for the test-suite; =======================================. Assuming you can run the test suite, (e.g.; ""``gmake TEST=nightly report``"" should work), it is really easy to run; optimizations or code generator components against every program in the; tree, collecting statistics or running custom checks for correctness. At; base, this is how the nightly tester works, it's just one example of a; general framework. Lets say that you have an LLVM optimization pass, and you want to see; how many times it triggers. First thing you should do is add an LLVM; `statistic <ProgrammersManual.html#Statistic>`_ to your pass, which will; tally counts of things you care about. Following this, you can set up a test and a report that collects these; and formats them for easy viewing. This consists of two files, a; ""``test-suite/TEST.XXX.Makefile``"" fragment (where XXX is the name of; your test) and a ""``test-suite/TEST.XXX.report``"" file that indicates; how to format the output into a table. There are many example reports of; various levels of sophistication included with the test suite, and the; framework is very general. If you are interested in testing an optimization pass, check out the; ""libcalls"" test as an example. It can be run like this:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd llvm/projects/test-suite/MultiSource/Benchmarks # or some other level; % make TEST=libcalls report.

In above example, `gamma_cdf()` falls back to Numeric; Differentiation but other functions in `MathFuncs.h` will still be; able to use AD. This is because Clad is going to assume that you have a; derivative for this `gamma_cdf()` function, and the remaining functions will; use AD as expected. In the end, the remaining functions (including; `gamma_cdf()`) will try to fall back to Numeric Differentiation. However, if you want to add pure AD support, you need to make sure that all; your external functions are supported by Clad (meaning there is a custom; derivative defined for each of them). ### How do I test my new class while adding AD support?. Please look at the test classes that test the derivatives, evaluates,; fixtures, etc. (defined in 'roofit/roofitcore/test'). You can clone and adapt; these tests to your class as needed. For example:. > [roofit/roofitcore/test/testRooFuncWrapper.cxx](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/test/testRooFuncWrapper.cxx). > Tip: Tests like above can be referenced to see which parts of RooFit already; support AD. ### How do I control my compile time?. This is an area of research that still needs some work. In most cases, the; compile times are reasonable, but with an increase in the level of complexity,; higher compile times may be encountered. ## Appendix B - Where does AD Logic Implementation reside?.

Fixed (preassigned) registers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. One important issue that the code generator needs to be aware of is the presence; of fixed registers. In particular, there are often places in the instruction; stream where the register allocator *must* arrange for a particular value to be; in a particular register. This can occur due to limitations of the instruction; set (e.g., the X86 can only do a 32-bit divide with the ``EAX``/``EDX``; registers), or external factors like calling conventions. In any case, the; instruction selector should emit code that copies a virtual register into or out; of a physical register when needed. For example, consider this simple LLVM example:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @test(i32 %X, i32 %Y) {; %Z = sdiv i32 %X, %Y; ret i32 %Z; }. The X86 instruction selector might produce this machine code for the ``div`` and; ``ret``:. .. code-block:: text. ;; Start of div; %EAX = mov %reg1024 ;; Copy X (in reg1024) into EAX; %reg1027 = sar %reg1024, 31; %EDX = mov %reg1027 ;; Sign extend X into EDX; idiv %reg1025 ;; Divide by Y (in reg1025); %reg1026 = mov %EAX ;; Read the result (Z) out of EAX. ;; Start of ret; %EAX = mov %reg1026 ;; 32-bit return value goes in EAX; ret. By the end of code generation, the register allocator would coalesce the; registers and delete the resultant identity moves producing the following; code:. .. code-block:: text. ;; X is in EAX, Y is in ECX; mov %EAX, %EDX; sar %EDX, 31; idiv %ECX; ret.

You; need to decide which is more appropriate in each case. **Using ``target=...``**. Checking the target triple can be tricky; it's easy to mis-specify. For; example, ``target=mips{{.*}}`` will match not only mips, but also mipsel,; mips64, and mips64el. ``target={{.*}}-linux-gnu`` will match; x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, but not armv8l-unknown-linux-gnueabihf.; Prefer to use hyphens to delimit triple components (``target=mips-{{.*}}``); and it's generally a good idea to use a trailing wildcard to allow for; unexpected suffixes. Also, it's generally better to write regular expressions that use entire; triple components, than to do something clever to shorten them. For; example, to match both freebsd and netbsd in an expression, you could write; ``target={{.*(free|net)bsd.*}}`` and that would work. However, it would; prevent a ``grep freebsd`` from finding this test. Better to use:; ``target={{.+-freebsd.*}} || target={{.+-netbsd.*}}``. Substitutions; -------------.

This tool, provided a binary or DSO, should infer whether; indirect control flow operations are protected by CFI, and should output these; results in a human-readable form. This tool should also be added as part of Clang's continuous integration testing; framework, where modifications to the compiler ensure that CFI protection; schemes are still present in the final binary. Location; ========. This tool will be present as a part of the LLVM toolchain, and will reside in; the ""/llvm/tools/llvm-cfi-verify"" directory, relative to the LLVM trunk. It will; be tested in two methods:. - Unit tests to validate code sections, present in; ""/llvm/unittests/tools/llvm-cfi-verify"".; - Integration tests, present in ""/llvm/tools/clang/test/LLVMCFIVerify"". These; integration tests are part of clang as part of a continuous integration; framework, ensuring updates to the compiler that reduce CFI coverage on; indirect control flow instructions are identified. Background; ==========. This tool will continuously validate that CFI directives are properly; implemented around all indirect control flows by analysing the output machine; code. The analysis of machine code is important as it ensures that any bugs; present in linker or compiler do not subvert CFI protections in the final; shipped binary. Unprotected indirect control flow instructions will be flagged for manual; review. These unexpected control flows may simply have not been accounted for in; the compiler implementation of CFI (e.g. indirect jumps to facilitate switch; statements may not be fully protected). It may be possible in the future to extend this tool to flag unnecessary CFI; directives (e.g. CFI directives around a static call to a non-polymorphic base; type).

Testability,"rview; ========. This document is the reference manual for the LLVM testing; infrastructure. It documents the structure of the LLVM testing; infrastructure, the tools needed to use it, and how to add and run; tests. Requirements; ============. In order to use the LLVM testing infrastructure, you will need all of the; software required to build LLVM, as well as `Python <http://python.org>`_ 3.6 or; later. LLVM Testing Infrastructure Organization; ========================================. The LLVM testing infrastructure contains three major categories of tests:; unit tests, regression tests and whole programs. The unit tests and regression; tests are contained inside the LLVM repository itself under ``llvm/unittests``; and ``llvm/test`` respectively and are expected to always pass -- they should be; run before every commit. The whole programs tests are referred to as the ""LLVM test suite"" (or; ""test-suite"") and are in the ``test-suite``; `repository on GitHub <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git>`_.; For historical reasons, these tests are also referred to as the ""nightly; tests"" in places, which is less ambiguous than ""test-suite"" and remains; in use although we run them much more often than nightly. Unit tests; ----------. Unit tests are written using `Google Test <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/primer.md>`_; and `Google Mock <https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/gmock_for_dummies.md>`_; and are located in the ``llvm/unittests`` directory.; In general unit tests are reserved for targeting the support library and other; generic data structure, we prefer relying on regression tests for testing; transformations and analysis on the IR. Regression tests; ----------------. The regression tests are small pieces of code that test a specific; feature of LLVM or trigger a specific bug in LLVM. The language they are; written in depends on the part of LLVM being tested.

Writing a ROOT **`TTree`** in a Python session is a little convoluted,; if only because you will need a C++ class to make sure that data members; can be mapped, unless you are working with built-in types. Here is an; example for working with the latter only:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import TFile, TTree; from array import array. h = TH1F('h1','test',100,-10.,10.); f = TFile('test.root','recreate'); t = TTree('t1','tree with histos'); maxn = 10; n = array('i',[0]); d = array('f',maxn*[0.]); t.Branch('mynum',n,'mynum/I'); t.Branch('myval',d,'myval[mynum]/F'). for i in range(25):; n[0] = min(i,maxn); for j in range(n[0]):; d[j] = i*0.1+j; t.Fill(). f.Write(); f.Close(); ```. The use of arrays is needed, because the pointer to the address of the; object that is used for filling must be given to the **`TTree::Branch()`**; call, even though the formal argument is declared a '`void*'`. In the; case of ROOT objects, similar pointer manipulation is unnecessary,; because the full type information is available, and `TTree::Branch()`; has been Pythonized to take care of the call details.

By default, XRay does not write out the trace files or patch the application; before main starts. If we run ``llc`` it should work like a normally built; binary. If we want to get a full trace of the application's operations (of the; functions we do end up instrumenting with XRay) then we need to enable XRay; at application start. To do this, XRay checks the ``XRAY_OPTIONS`` environment; variable. ::. # The following doesn't create an XRay trace by default.; $ ./bin/llc input.ll. # We need to set the XRAY_OPTIONS to enable some features.; $ XRAY_OPTIONS=""patch_premain=true xray_mode=xray-basic verbosity=1"" ./bin/llc input.ll; ==69819==XRay: Log file in 'xray-log.llc.m35qPB'.

Having a trace then allows us to do basic accounting of the functions that were; instrumented, and how much time we're spending in parts of the code. To make; sense of this data, we use the ``llvm-xray`` tool which has a few subcommands; to help us understand our trace. One of the things we can do is to get an accounting of the functions that have; been instrumented.

The default rules can change between major; versions of black. In order to avoid unnecessary churn in the formatting rules,; we currently use black version 23.x in LLVM. When contributing a patch unrelated to formatting, you should format only the; Python code that the patch modifies. For this purpose, use the `darker; <https://pypi.org/project/darker/>`_ utility, which runs default black rules; over only the modified Python code. Doing so should ensure the patch will pass; the Python format checks in LLVM's pre-commit CI, which also uses darker. When; contributing a patch specifically for reformatting Python files, use black,; which currently only supports formatting entire files. Here are some quick examples, but see the black and darker documentation for; details:. .. code-block:: bash. $ pip install black=='23.*' darker # install black 23.x and darker; $ darker test.py # format uncommitted changes; $ darker -r HEAD^ test.py # also format changes from last commit; $ black test.py # format entire file. Instead of individual file names, you can specify directories to; darker, and it will find the changed files. However, if a directory is; large, like a clone of the LLVM repository, darker can be painfully; slow.

Testability,"s a global pointer; ***`gGeoManager`*** in order to be fully accessible from external code.; The manager class is the owner of all geometry objects defined in a; session; therefore, users must not try to control their deletion. It; contains lists of media, materials, transformations, shapes and volumes.; A special case is the one of geometrical transformations. When creating; a matrix or a translation, this is by default owned by external objects.; The manager class becomes owner of all transformations used for; positioning volumes. In order to force the ownership for other; transformations, one can use `TGeoMatrix::RegisterYourself()` method. Do; not be therefore surprised that some transformations cannot be found by; name when creating a composite shape for instance if you did not; register them after creation. Logical nodes (positioned volumes) are created and destroyed by the; **`TGeoVolume`** class. Physical nodes and their global transformations; are subjected to a caching mechanism due to the sometimes very large; memory requirements of logical graph expansion. The total number of; physical instances of volumes triggers the caching mechanism and the; cache manager is a client of **`TGeoManager`**. The manager class also; controls the drawing/checking package (**`TGeoPainter`** client).

The linker; generates this automatically based on a hash that includes the complete symbol; table and debugging information, even if this is later stripped from the binary. This specification uses the ELF Build ID as the sole means of identifying; binaries. Each binary relevant to the log must have been linked with a unique; Build ID. The symbolizing filter must have some means of mapping a Build ID back; to the original ELF binary (either the whole unstripped binary, or a stripped; binary paired with a separate debug file). Colorization; ============. The markup format supports a restricted subset of ANSI X3.64 SGR (Select Graphic; Rendition) control sequences. These are unlike other markup elements:. * They specify presentation details (bold or colors) rather than semantic; information. The association of semantic meaning with color (e.g. red for; errors) is chosen by the code doing the logging, rather than by the UI; presentation of the symbolizing filter. This is a concession to existing code; (e.g. LLVM sanitizer runtimes) that use specific colors and would require; substantial changes to generate semantic markup instead. * A single control sequence changes ""the state"", rather than being an; hierarchical structure that surrounds affected text. The filter processes ANSI SGR control sequences only within a single line. If a; control sequence to enter a bold or color state is encountered, it's expected; that the control sequence to reset to default state will be encountered before; the end of that line. If a ""dangling"" state is left at the end of a line, the; filter may reset to default state for the next line.

Testability,"s a; note. The exact behavior of the ``assert`` statement depends on its; placement. * At top level, the assertion is checked immediately. * In a record definition, the statement is saved and all assertions are; checked after the record is completely built. * In a class definition, the assertions are saved and inherited by all; the subclasses and records that inherit from the class. The assertions are; then checked when the records are completely built. * In a multiclass definition, the assertions are saved with the other; components of the multiclass and then checked each time the multiclass; is instantiated with ``defm``. Using assertions in TableGen files can simplify record checking in TableGen; backends. Here is an example of an ``assert`` in two class definitions. .. code-block:: text. class PersonName<string name> {; assert !le(!size(name), 32), ""person name is too long: "" # name;; string Name = name;; }. class Person<string name, int age> : PersonName<name> {; assert !and(!ge(age, 1), !le(age, 120)), ""person age is invalid: "" # age;; int Age = age;; }. def Rec20 : Person<""Donald Knuth"", 60> {; ...; }. Additional Details; ==================. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs); ------------------------------. A directed acyclic graph can be represented directly in TableGen using the; ``dag`` datatype. A DAG node consists of an operator and zero or more; arguments (or operands). Each argument can be of any desired type. By using; another DAG node as an argument, an arbitrary graph of DAG nodes can be; built. The syntax of a ``dag`` instance is:. ``(`` *operator* *argument1*\ ``,`` *argument2*\ ``,`` ... ``)``. The operator must be present and must be a record. There can be zero or more; arguments, separated by commas. The operator and arguments can have three; formats. ====================== =============================================; Format Meaning; ====================== =============================================; *value* argument value; *value*\ ``:``\ *nam",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst:50333,assert,assert,50333,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TableGen/ProgRef.rst,1,['assert'],['assert']
Testability,"s about unreachable; branches, etc., but can be used whenever reaching a particular code path is; unconditionally a bug (not originating from user input; see below) of some kind.; Use of ``assert`` should always include a testable predicate (as opposed to; ``assert(false)``). If the error condition can be triggered by user input then the; recoverable error mechanism described in :doc:`ProgrammersManual` should be; used instead. In cases where this is not practical, ``report_fatal_error`` may; be used. Another issue is that values used only by assertions will produce an ""unused; value"" warning when assertions are disabled. For example, this code will warn:. .. code-block:: c++. unsigned Size = V.size();; assert(Size > 42 && ""Vector smaller than it should be"");. bool NewToSet = Myset.insert(Value);; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");. These are two interesting different cases. In the first case, the call to; ``V.size()`` is only useful for the assert, and we don't want it executed when; assertions are disabled. Code like this should move the call into the assert; itself. In the second case, the side effects of the call must happen whether; the assert is enabled or not. In this case, the value should be cast to void to; disable the warning. To be specific, it is preferred to write the code like; this:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(V.size() > 42 && ""Vector smaller than it should be"");. bool NewToSet = Myset.insert(Value); (void)NewToSet;; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");.

In LLVM, we prefer to explicitly prefix all identifiers from the standard; namespace with an ""``std::``"" prefix, rather than rely on ""``using namespace; std;``"".

Testability,"s added to the position of a declaration attribute, e.g., ``int; *ptr __counted_by(size)``, the attribute appertains to the outermost pointer; type of the declaration (``int *``). New sugar types; ===============. An external bounds annotation creates a type sugar of the underlying pointer; types. We will introduce a new sugar type, ``DynamicBoundsPointerType`` to; represent ``__counted_by`` or ``__sized_by``. Using ``AttributedType`` would not; be sufficient because the type needs to hold the count or size expression as; well as some metadata necessary for analysis, while this type may be implemented; through inheritance from ``AttributedType``. Treating the annotations as type; sugars means two types with incompatible external bounds annotations may be; considered canonically the same types. This is sometimes necessary, for example,; to make the ``__counted_by`` and friends not participate in function; overloading. However, this design requires a separate logic to walk through the; entire type hierarchy to check type compatibility of bounds annotations. Late parsing for C; ==================. A bounds annotation such as ``__counted_by(count)`` can be added to type of a; struct field declaration where count is another field of the same struct; declared later. Similarly, the annotation may apply to type of a function; parameter declaration which precedes the parameter count in the same function.; This means parsing the argument of bounds annotations must be done after the; parser has the whole context of a struct or a function declaration. Clang has; late parsing logic for C++ declaration attributes that require late parsing,; while the C declaration attributes and C/C++ type attributes do not have the; same logic. This requires introducing late parsing logic for C/C++ type; attributes.

The conversion from a lambda to a block pointer is only available in; Objective-C++, and not in C++ with blocks, due to its use of Objective-C memory; management (autorelease).

Clang provides support for :doc:`Object Literals and Subscripting; <ObjectiveCLiterals>` in Objective-C, which simplifies common Objective-C; programming patterns, makes programs more concise, and improves the safety of; container creation.

You actually never return nil.; You do return nil sometimes, and callers are supposed to handle that. This; includes cases where your method is documented to return nil given certain; inputs.; You return nil based on some external condition (such as an out-of-memory; error), but the client can't do anything about it either.; You return nil only when the caller passes input documented to be invalid.; That means it's the client's fault.; You return nil in some totally undocumented case.

For example, to assign the result to a value of type ``BaseClass``, you; could write either of these::. BaseClass b = !getdagop<BaseClass>(someDag);; BaseClass b = !cast<BaseClass>(!getdagop(someDag));.

The ONNX parser supports now several new ONNX operators. The list of the current supported ONNX operator is the following:; - Gemm; - Conv (in 1D,2D and 3D); - RNN, GRU, LSTM; - Relu, Selu, Sigmoid, Softmax, Tanh, LeakyRelu; - BatchNormalization; - MaxPool, AveragePool, GlobalAverage; - ConvTranspose; - Gather; - Expand, Reduce; - Neg, Exp, Sqrt, Reciprocal; - Add, Sum, Mul, Div; - Reshape, Flatten, Transpose; - Squeeze, Unsqueeze, Slice; - Concat, Reduce; - Identity; - Shape. In addition a Custom (user defined) operator is supported. An example of using a Custom operator is the program `tmva/pymva/test/EmitCustomModel.cxx`. The ONNX parser supports also the fusing of the operators MatMul + Add in a Gemm operator and fusing Conv + Add and ConvTranspose + Add. #### SOFIE Keras Parser. The Keras parser supports now model with input batch size not defined (e.g `bathsize=-1`), and by default the model is generated with `batchsize=1`.; The Keras parser supports now in addition to the Dense layer the Conv2D layer, several activation functions (Relu, Selu, Sigmoid, Softmax, Tanh, LeakyRelu) and these other layers: BatchNormalization, Reshape, Convatenate, Add, Subtract, Multiply.; Models with Dropout layers are supported in case the Dropout is used only during training and not inference. For model having operators not yet supported in the Keras parser it is then reccomended to convert the Keras model to `ONNX` using the python `tf2onnx` tool. #### SOFIE PyTorch Parser.

Testability,"s byref, sret, inalloca and preallocated.; * Some intrinsics require an ``elementtype`` attribute, which can be retrieved; using ``getParamElementType()``. This attribute is required in cases where; the intrinsic does not naturally encode a needed element type. This is also; used for inline assembly. Note that some of the methods mentioned above only exist to support both typed; and opaque pointers at the same time, and will be dropped once the migration; has completed. For example, ``isOpaqueOrPointeeTypeEquals()`` becomes; meaningless once all pointers are opaque. While direct usage of pointer element types is immediately apparent in code,; there is a more subtle issue that opaque pointers need to contend with: A lot; of code assumes that pointer equality also implies that the used load/store; type or GEP source element type is the same. Consider the following examples; with typed and opaque pointers:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @test(i32* %p) {; store i32 0, i32* %p; %bc = bitcast i32* %p to i64*; %v = load i64, i64* %bc; ret i64 %v; }. define i32 @test(ptr %p) {; store i32 0, ptr %p; %v = load i64, ptr %p; ret i64 %v; }. Without opaque pointers, a check that the pointer operand of the load and; store are the same also ensures that the accessed type is the same. Using a; different type requires a bitcast, which will result in distinct pointer; operands. With opaque pointers, the bitcast is not present, and this check is no longer; sufficient. In the above example, it could result in store to load forwarding; of an incorrect type. Code making such assumptions needs to be adjusted to; check the accessed type explicitly:; ``LI->getType() == SI->getValueOperand()->getType()``. Frontends; ---------.

Testability,"s called **`TBranch`**.; If two variables are independent, and the designer knows the variables; will not be used together, they should be placed on separate branches.; If, however, the variables are related, such as the coordinates of a; point, it is most efficient to create one branch with both coordinates; on it. A variable on a **`TBranch`** is called a leaf (yes -; **`TLeaf`**). Another point to keep in mind when designing trees is that; branches of the same **`TTree`** can be written to separate files. To; add a **`TBranch`** to a **`TTree`** we call the; method **`TTree::Branch()`**. Note that we DO NOT use the `TBranch`; constructor. The `TTree::Branch` method has several signatures. The branch type; differs by what is stored in it. A branch can hold an entire object, a; list of simple variables, contents of a folder, contents of a; **`TList`**, or an array of objects. Let's see some examples. To follow; along you will need the shared library `libEvent.so`. First, check if it; is in `$ROOTSYS/test`. If it is, copy it to your own area. If it is not; there, you have to build it by typing make in `$ROOTSYS/test`. ## Adding a Branch to Hold a List of Variables. As in the very first example (`cernstaff.root.root`); the data we want to save is a list of simple variables, such as integers; or floats. In this case, we use the following `TTree::Branch` signature:. ``` {.cpp}; tree->Branch(""Ev_Branch"",&event,; ""temp/F:ntrack/I:nseg:nvtex:flag/i"");; ```. The first parameter is the branch name. The second parameter is the address from which the first variable is to; be read. In the code above, ""event"" is a structure with one float and; three integers and one unsigned integer. You should not assume that the; compiler aligns the elements of a structure without gaps. To avoid; alignment problems, you need to use structures with same length members.; If your structure does not qualify, you need to create one branch for; each element of the structure. The leaf name is NOT use",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:19144,test,test,19144,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"s can be object files, archives, or dynamic libraries. The **lib**; directory is just a convenient place for libraries as it places them all in; a directory from which they can be linked later. **include**. This subdirectory should contain any header files that are global to your; project. By global, we mean that they are used by more than one library or; executable of your project. By placing your header files in **include**, they will be found; automatically by the LLVM build system. For example, if you have a file; **include/jazz/note.h**, then your source files can include it simply with; **#include ""jazz/note.h""**. **tools**. This subdirectory should contain all of your source code for executables.; For each program that you build, you will have one directory in **tools**; that will contain that program's source code. **test**. This subdirectory should contain tests that verify that your code works; correctly. Automated tests are especially useful. Currently, the LLVM build system provides basic support for tests. The LLVM; system provides the following:. * LLVM contains regression tests in ``llvm/test``. These tests are run by the; :doc:`Lit <CommandGuide/lit>` testing tool. This test procedure uses ``RUN``; lines in the actual test case to determine how to run the test. See the; :doc:`TestingGuide` for more details. * LLVM contains an optional package called ``llvm-test``, which provides; benchmarks and programs that are known to compile with the Clang front; end. You can use these programs to test your code, gather statistical; information, and compare it to the current LLVM performance statistics. Currently, there is no way to hook your tests directly into the ``llvm/test``; testing harness. You will simply need to find a way to use the source; provided within that directory on your own. Typically, you will want to build your **lib** directory first followed by your; **tools** directory. Writing LLVM Style Makefiles; ============================.

This will create an '``llvm-project``' directory in the current directory and; fully populate it with all of the source code, test directories, and local; copies of documentation files for LLVM and all the related subprojects. Note; that unlike the tarballs, which contain each subproject in a separate file, the; git repository contains all of the projects together. If you want to get a specific release (as opposed to the most recent revision),; you can check out a tag after cloning the repository. E.g., `git checkout; llvmorg-6.0.1` inside the ``llvm-project`` directory created by the above; command. Use `git tag -l` to list all of them. Sending patches; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Testability,"s for OpenCL; ------------------------. There is ongoing work to support C++ standard libraries from `LLVM's libcxx; <https://libcxx.llvm.org/>`_ in OpenCL kernel code using C++ for OpenCL mode. It is currently possible to include `type_traits` from C++17 in the kernel; sources when the following clang extensions are enabled; ``__cl_clang_function_pointers`` and ``__cl_clang_variadic_functions``,; see :doc:`LanguageExtensions` for more details. The use of non-conformant; features enabled by the extensions does not expose non-conformant behavior; beyond the compilation i.e. does not get generated in IR or binary.; The extension only appear in metaprogramming; mechanism to identify or verify the properties of types. This allows to provide; the full C++ functionality without a loss of portability. To avoid unsafe use; of the extensions it is recommended that the extensions are disabled directly; after the header include. **Example of Use**:. The example of kernel code with `type_traits` is illustrated here. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION __cl_clang_function_pointers : enable; #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION __cl_clang_variadic_functions : enable; #include <type_traits>; #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION __cl_clang_function_pointers : disable; #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION __cl_clang_variadic_functions : disable. using sint_type = std::make_signed<unsigned int>::type;. __kernel void foo() {; static_assert(!std::is_same<sint_type, unsigned int>::value);; }. The possible clang invocation to compile the example is as follows:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -I<path to libcxx checkout or installation>/include test.clcpp. Note that `type_traits` is a header only library and therefore no extra; linking step against the standard libraries is required. See full example; in `Compiler Explorer <https://godbolt.org/z/5WbnTfb65>`_.

Testability,"s likely to add support; for newer versions of an architecture and the architecture is known to be; designed for backwards compatibility then it should be possible to express; compatibility for such architecture versions in the multilib configuration. Not GNU spec files; ------------------. The GNU spec files standard is large and complex and there's little desire to; import that complexity to LLVM. It's also heavily oriented towards processing; command line argument strings which is hard to do correctly, hence the large; amount of logic dedicated to that task in the Clang driver. While compatibility; with GNU would bring benefits, the cost in this case is deemed too high. Avoid re-inventing feature detection in the configuration; ---------------------------------------------------------. A large amount of logic in the Clang driver is dedicated to inferring which; architectural features are available based on the given command line options.; It is neither desirable nor practical to repeat such logic in each multilib; configuration. Instead the configuration should be able to benefit from the; heavy lifting Clang already does to detect features. Low maintenance; ---------------. Multilib is a relatively small feature in the scheme of things so supporting it; should accordingly take little time. Where possible this should be achieved by; implementing it in terms of existing features in the LLVM codebase. Minimal additional API surface; ------------------------------. The greater the API surface, the greater the difficulty of keeping it stable.; Where possible the additional API surface should be kept small by defining it; in relation to existing APIs. An example of this is keeping a simple; relationship between flag names and command line options where possible.; Since the command line options are part of a stable API they are unlikely; to change, and therefore the flag names get the same stability.

In order to; have navigation features properly working one has to follow some rules; for building a valid geometry. - The daughter volume(s) must not extrude the mother shape. They are; allowed however to have a common boundaries.; - The volumes positioned in the same container must not overlap with; each other. They may touch on one boundaries or shape vertex. The daughter nodes of a volume can be also removed or replaced with; other nodes:. ~~~{.cpp}; void RemoveNode(TGeoNode* node); TGeoNode*ReplaceNode(TGeoNode* nodeorig, TGeoShape* newshape = 0,; TGeoMatrix* newpos = 0, TGeoMedium* newmed = 0); ~~~. The last method allows replacing an existing daughter of a volume with; another one. Providing only the node to be replaced will just create a; new volume for the node but having exactly the same parameters as the; old one. This helps in case of divisions for decoupling a node from the; logical hierarchy so getting new content/properties. For non-divided; volumes, one can change the shape and/or the position of the daughter. \anchor GP01bd; #### Virtual Containers and Assemblies of Volumes. Virtual containers are volumes that do not represent real objects, but; they are needed for grouping and positioning together other volumes.; Such grouping helps not only geometry creation, but also optimizes; tracking performance; therefore, it is highly recommended. Virtual; volumes need to inherit material/medium properties from the volume they; are placed into in order to be ""invisible"" at tracking time. Let us suppose that we need to group together two volumes `A` and `B`; into a structure and position this into several other volumes `D,E,` and; `F`.

Testability,"s methods. The subsequent divisions are the; methods other parent classes in case of multiple inheritance. For; example, see the `TPaveText::title context; menu.` A **`TPaveText`** inherits from **`TAttLine`**, which has the; method `SetLineAttributes()`. #### Adding Context Menus for a Class. For a method to appear in the context menu of the object it has to be; marked by `// *MENU*` in the header file. Below is the line from; `TAttLine.h` that adds the `SetLineAttribute` method to the context; menu. ``` {.cpp}; virtual void SetLineAttributes(); // *MENU*; ```. Nothing else is needed, since Cling knows the classes and their methods.; It takes advantage of that to create the context menu on the fly when; the object is clicking on. If you click on an axis, ROOT will ask the; interpreter what are the methods of the **`TAxis`** and which ones are; set for being displayed in a context menu. Now, how does the interpreter know this? Remember, when you build a; class that you want to use in the ROOT environment, you use `rootcling`; that builds the so-called stub functions and the dictionary. These; functions and the dictionary contain the knowledge of the used classes.; To do this, `rootcling` parses all the header files. ROOT has defined; some special syntax to inform Cling of certain things, this is done in; the comments so that the code still compiles with a C++ compiler. For example, you have a class with a `Draw()` method, which will display; itself. You would like a context menu to appear when on clicks on the; image of an object of this class. The recipe is the following:. - The class has to contain the `ClassDef/ClassImp` macros. - For each method you want to appear in the context menu, put a; comment after the declaration containing `*MENU*` or `*TOGGLE*`; depending on the behavior you expect. One usually uses Set methods; (setters). The `*TOGGLE*` comment is used to toggle a `boolean` data; field. In that case, it is safe to call the data field `fMyBool`; where `",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md:6736,stub,stub,6736,documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,1,['stub'],['stub']

Loops are rotated by the LoopRotate (:ref:`loop-rotate <passes-loop-rotate>`); pass, which converts loops into do/while style loops and is; implemented in; `LoopRotation.h <https://llvm.org/doxygen/LoopRotation_8h_source.html>`_. Example:. .. code-block:: C. void test(int n) {; for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 1); // Loop body; }. is transformed to:. .. code-block:: C. void test(int n) {; int i = 0;; do {; // Loop body; i += 1;; } while (i < n);; }. **Warning**: This transformation is valid only if the compiler; can prove that the loop body will be executed at least once. Otherwise,; it has to insert a guard which will test it at runtime. In the example; above, that would be:. .. code-block:: C. void test(int n) {; int i = 0;; if (n > 0) {; do {; // Loop body; i += 1;; } while (i < n);; }; }.

Once :program:`lit` has mapped the inputs into test suites it traverses the; list of inputs adding tests for individual files and recursively searching for; tests in directories. This behavior makes it easy to specify a subset of tests to run, while still; allowing the test suite configuration to control exactly how tests are; interpreted.

Testability,"s they are needed. Types have a couple of non-obvious; features: 1) they do not capture type qualifiers like ``const`` or ``volatile``; (see :ref:`QualType <QualType>`), and 2) they implicitly capture typedef; information. Once created, types are immutable (unlike decls). Typedefs in C make semantic analysis a bit more complex than it would be without; them. The issue is that we want to capture typedef information and represent it; in the AST perfectly, but the semantics of operations need to ""see through""; typedefs. For example, consider this code:. .. code-block:: c++. void func() {; typedef int foo;; foo X, *Y;; typedef foo *bar;; bar Z;; *X; // error; **Y; // error; **Z; // error; }. The code above is illegal, and thus we expect there to be diagnostics emitted; on the annotated lines.

While this example is somewhat silly, it illustrates the point: we want to; retain typedef information where possible, so that we can emit errors about; ""``std::string``"" instead of ""``std::basic_string<char, std:...``"". Doing this; requires properly keeping typedef information (for example, the type of ``X``; is ""``foo``"", not ""``int``""), and requires properly propagating it through the; various operators (for example, the type of ``*Y`` is ""``foo``"", not; ""``int``""). In order to retain this information, the type of these expressions; is an instance of the ``TypedefType`` class, which indicates that the type of; these expressions is a typedef for ""``foo``"". Representing types like this is great for diagnostics, because the; user-specified type is always immediately available.

If the extra files are large, the idiomatic place to put them is in a subdirectory ``Inputs``.; You can then refer to the extra files as ``%S/Inputs/foo.bar``. For example, consider ``test/Linker/ident.ll``. The directory structure is; as follows::. test/; Linker/; ident.ll; Inputs/; ident.a.ll; ident.b.ll. For convenience, these are the contents:. .. code-block:: llvm. ;;;;; ident.ll:. ; RUN: llvm-link %S/Inputs/ident.a.ll %S/Inputs/ident.b.ll -S | FileCheck %s. ; Verify that multiple input llvm.ident metadata are linked together. ; CHECK-DAG: !llvm.ident = !{!0, !1, !2}; ; CHECK-DAG: ""Compiler V1""; ; CHECK-DAG: ""Compiler V2""; ; CHECK-DAG: ""Compiler V3"". ;;;;; Inputs/ident.a.ll:. !llvm.ident = !{!0, !1}; !0 = metadata !{metadata !""Compiler V1""}; !1 = metadata !{metadata !""Compiler V2""}. ;;;;; Inputs/ident.b.ll:. !llvm.ident = !{!0}; !0 = metadata !{metadata !""Compiler V3""}. For symmetry reasons, ``ident.ll`` is just a dummy file that doesn't; actually participate in the test besides holding the ``RUN:`` lines. .. note::. Some existing tests use ``RUN: true`` in extra files instead of just; putting the extra files in an ``Inputs/`` directory. This pattern is; deprecated. Fragile tests; -------------. It is easy to write a fragile test that would fail spuriously if the tool being; tested outputs a full path to the input file.

For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: opt -S %s | FileCheck. define i32 @main() nounwind {; ; CHECK-NOT: load; ret i32 0; }. This test will fail if placed into a ``download`` directory.

You now have a basic; but fully functioning JIT stack that you can use to take LLVM IR and make it; executable within the context of your JIT process. In the next chapter we'll; look at how to extend this JIT to produce better quality code, and in the; process take a deeper look at the ORC layer concept. `Next: Extending the KaleidoscopeJIT <BuildingAJIT2.html>`_. Full Code Listing; =================. Here is the complete code listing for our running example. To build this; example, use:. .. code-block:: bash. # Compile; clang++ -g toy.cpp `llvm-config --cxxflags --ldflags --system-libs --libs core orcjit native` -O3 -o toy; # Run; ./toy. Here is the code:. .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/Kaleidoscope/BuildingAJIT/Chapter1/KaleidoscopeJIT.h; :language: c++. ..

Baseline tests (no-functional-change or NFC patch) may be pushed to main; without pre-commit review if you have commit access. Best practices for regression tests; -----------------------------------. - Use auto-generated check lines (produced by the scripts mentioned above); whenever feasible.; - Include comments about what is tested/expected in a particular test. If there; are relevant issues in the bug tracker, add references to those bug reports; (for example, ""See PR999 for more details"").; - Avoid undefined behavior and poison/undef values unless necessary. For; example, do not use patterns like ``br i1 undef``, which are likely to break; as a result of future optimizations.; - Minimize tests by removing unnecessary instructions, metadata, attributes,; etc. Tools like ``llvm-reduce`` can help automate this.; - Outside PhaseOrdering tests, only run a minimal set of passes. For example,; prefer ``opt -S -passes=instcombine`` over ``opt -S -O3``.; - Avoid unnamed instructions/blocks (such as ``%0`` or ``1:``), because they may; require renumbering on future test modifications. These can be removed by; running the test through ``opt -S -passes=instnamer``.; - Try to give values (including variables, blocks and functions) meaningful; names, and avoid retaining complex names generated by the optimization; pipeline (such as ``%foo.0.0.0.0.0.0``).

If your test requires extra files besides the file containing the ``RUN:`` lines; and the extra files are small, consider specifying them in the same file and; using ``split-file`` to extract them.

Testability,"s us use the ``MachineVerifier`` to enforce invariants; that are required beyond certain points of the pipeline. For example, a; function with the ``legalized`` property can have the ``MachineVerifier``; enforce that no illegal instructions occur. Similarly, a; ``regBankSelected`` function may not have virtual registers without a register; bank assigned. .. note::. For layering reasons, ``MachineVerifier`` isn't able to be the sole verifier; in GlobalISel. Currently some of the passes also perform verification while; we find a way to solve this problem. The main issue is that GlobalISel is a separate library, so we can't; directly reference it from CodeGen. Testing; -------. The ability to test GlobalISel is significantly improved over SelectionDAG.; SelectionDAG is something of a black box and there's a lot going on inside it.; This makes it difficult to write a test that reliably tests a particular aspect; of its behaviour. For comparison, see the following diagram:. .. image:: testing-pass-level.png. Each of the grey boxes indicates an opportunity to serialize the current state; and test the behaviour between two points in the pipeline. The current state; can be serialized using ``-stop-before`` or ``-stop-after`` and loaded using; ``-start-before``, ``-start-after``, and ``-run-pass``. We can also go further still, as many of GlobalISel's passes are readily unit; testable:. .. image:: testing-unit-level.png.

Testability,"s used in; your code), it should work for AD support efforts. Please view Clad; documentation for more details. ---. ## Appendix A - What could go wrong (FAQs). ### Will my analyticalIntegral() function support AD?. Both scenarios are possible:. 1 - where `analyticalIntegral()` will be able to support AD. 2 - where `analyticalIntegral()` will *not* be able to support AD. This requires further research. ### What if my evaluate() function cannot support AD?. In some cases. the `evaluate()` function is written in a piece-wise format; (multiple evaluations based on multiple chunks of code). You can review the; `MathFuncs.h` file to find AD support for several piece-wise (`if code==1; {...} else if code==2 {...}` ) code snippets. However, there may still be some cases where AD support may not be possible; due to the way that `evaluate()` function works in that instance. ### What if my evaluate() function depends heavily on caching?. For simple caching, the caching logic can be separated from the; mathematical code that is being moved to `MathFuncs.h`, so that it can; retained in the original file. For more complicated scenarios, the `code` variable can be used to identify; use cases (parts of the mathematical code in `evaluate()`) that should be; supported, while other parts that are explicitly not be supported (e.g., using; `if code==1 {...} else if code==2 {...}`). ### Can classes using Numerical Integration support AD?. So far, no. This needs further exploration. Hint: classes using Numerical; Integration can be identified with the absence of the `analyticalIntegral()`; function. ### Why is my code falling back to Numeric Differentiation?. If you call in to an external Math library, and you use a function that has a; customized variant with an already defined custom derivative, then you may see; a warning like ""falling back to Numeric Differentiation"". In most such cases,; your derivative should still work, since Numeric Differentiation is already; well-tested in Clad",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md:26790,log,logic,26790,roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md,1,['log'],['logic']
Testability,"s visible and no visible directive overrides it.; * A set of macro directives is *consistent* if it consists of only ``#undef`` directives, or if all ``#define`` directives in the set define the macro name to the same sequence of tokens (following the usual rules for macro redefinitions).; * If a macro name is used and the set of active directives is not consistent, the program is ill-formed. Otherwise, the (unique) meaning of the macro name is used. For example, suppose:. * ``<stdio.h>`` defines a macro ``getc`` (and exports its ``#define``); * ``<cstdio>`` imports the ``<stdio.h>`` module and undefines the macro (and exports its ``#undef``). The ``#undef`` overrides the ``#define``, and a source file that imports both modules *in any order* will not see ``getc`` defined as a macro. Module Map Language; ===================. .. warning::. The module map language is not currently guaranteed to be stable between major revisions of Clang. The module map language describes the mapping from header files to the; logical structure of modules. To enable support for using a library as; a module, one must write a ``module.modulemap`` file for that library. The; ``module.modulemap`` file is placed alongside the header files themselves,; and is written in the module map language described below. .. note::; For compatibility with previous releases, if a module map file named; ``module.modulemap`` is not found, Clang will also search for a file named; ``module.map``. This behavior is deprecated and we plan to eventually; remove it. As an example, the module map file for the C standard library might look a bit like this:. .. parsed-literal::. module std [system] [extern_c] {; module assert {; textual header ""assert.h""; header ""bits/assert-decls.h""; export *; }. module complex {; header ""complex.h""; export *; }. module ctype {; header ""ctype.h""; export *; }. module errno {; header ""errno.h""; header ""sys/errno.h""; export *; }. module fenv {; header ""fenv.h""; export *; }. // ...more ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:27400,log,logical,27400,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,1,['log'],['logical']

Just like for conventional; debug intrinsics, unless it is unreachable, it’s almost always incorrect to; delete a `llvm.dbg.assign` intrinsic. ### Lowering `llvm.dbg.assign` to MIR. To begin with only SelectionDAG ISel will be supported. `llvm.dbg.assign`; intrinsics are lowered to MIR `DBG_INSTR_REF` instructions. Before this happens; we need to decide where it is appropriate to use memory locations and where we; must use a non-memory location (or no location) for each variable. In order to; make those decisions we run a standard fixed-point dataflow analysis that makes; the choice at each instruction, iteratively joining the results for each block. ### TODO list. As this is an experimental work in progress so there are some items we still need; to tackle:. * As mentioned in test llvm/test/DebugInfo/assignment-tracking/X86/diamond-3.ll,; the analysis should treat escaping calls like untagged stores. * The system expects locals to be backed by a local alloca. This isn't always; the case - sometimes a pointer to storage is passed into a function; (e.g. sret, byval). We need to be able to handle those cases.

HOW LLVM-MCA WORKS; ------------------. :program:`llvm-mca` takes assembly code as input. The assembly code is parsed; into a sequence of MCInst with the help of the existing LLVM target assembly; parsers. The parsed sequence of MCInst is then analyzed by a ``Pipeline`` module; to generate a performance report. The Pipeline module simulates the execution of the machine code sequence in a; loop of iterations (default is 100). During this process, the pipeline collects; a number of execution related statistics. At the end of this process, the; pipeline generates and prints a report from the collected statistics. Here is an example of a performance report generated by the tool for a; dot-product of two packed float vectors of four elements. The analysis is; conducted for target x86, cpu btver2. The following result can be produced via; the following command using the example located at; ``test/tools/llvm-mca/X86/BtVer2/dot-product.s``:. .. code-block:: bash. $ llvm-mca -mtriple=x86_64-unknown-unknown -mcpu=btver2 -iterations=300 dot-product.s. .. code-block:: none.

'S' is passed via registers r0, r1, r2.

We have a script at ``utils/collect_and_build_with_pgo.py``. This script is; tested on a few Linux flavors, and requires a checkout of LLVM, Clang, and; compiler-rt. Despite the name, it performs four clean builds of Clang, so it; can take a while to run to completion. Please see the script's ``--help`` for; more information on how to run it, and the different options available to you.; If you want to get the most out of PGO for a particular use-case (e.g. compiling; a specific large piece of software), please do read the section below on; 'benchmark' selection. Please note that this script is only tested on a few Linux distros. Patches to; add support for other platforms, as always, are highly appreciated. :). This script also supports a ``--dry-run`` option, which causes it to print; important commands instead of running them. Selecting 'benchmarks'; ======================. PGO does best when the profiles gathered represent how the user plans to use the; compiler. Notably, highly accurate profiles of llc building x86_64 code aren't; incredibly helpful if you're going to be targeting ARM. By default, the script above does two things to get solid coverage. It:. - runs all of Clang and LLVM's lit tests, and; - uses the instrumented Clang to build Clang, LLVM, and all of the other; LLVM subprojects available to it. Together, these should give you:. - solid coverage of building C++,; - good coverage of building C,; - great coverage of running optimizations,; - great coverage of the backend for your host's architecture, and; - some coverage of other architectures (if other arches are supported backends).

Such a symbolic link hides the complexity of the path to the align; object and replaces it with a more meaningful name. In addition,; **`TGeoPNEntry`** objects are faster to search by name and they may; optionally store an additional user matrix. ``` {.cpp}; // Creating a symlink object.; TGeoPNEntry *TGeoManager::SetAlignableEntry(const char *unique_n,; const char*path); // Retrieving an existing alignable object.; TGeoPNEntry *TGeoManager::GetAlignableEntry(const char *name); // Retrieving an existing alignable object at a given index.; TGeoPNEntry *GetAlignableEntry(Int_t index); ```.

This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch. Using a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A PCH file can then be used as a prefix header when a ``-include-pch``; option is passed to ``clang``:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test. The ``clang`` driver will check if the PCH file ``test.h.pch`` is; available; if so, the contents of ``test.h`` (and the files it includes); will be processed from the PCH file. Otherwise, Clang will report an error. .. note::. Clang does *not* automatically use PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``. Relocatable PCH Files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. It is sometimes necessary to build a precompiled header from headers; that are not yet in their final, installed locations. For example, one; might build a precompiled header within the build tree that is then; meant to be i",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:47096,test,test,47096,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['test'],['test']

LLVM currently encodes variable fragment information; in `DIExpression`s, so as an implementation quirk the `FragmentInfo` for; `Variable` is contained within `ValueExpression` only. The formal LLVM-IR signature is:; ```; void @llvm.dbg.assign(metadata, metadata, metadata, metadata, metadata, metadata); ```. ### Instruction link: `DIAssignID`. `DIAssignID` metadata is the mechanism that is currently used to encode the; store<->marker link. The metadata node has no operands and all instances are; `distinct`; equality is checked for by comparing addresses. `llvm.dbg.assign` intrinsics use a `DIAssignID` metadata node instance as an; operand. This way it refers to any store-like instruction that has the same; `DIAssignID` attachment. E.g. For this test.cpp,. ```; int fun(int a) {; return a;; }; ```; compiled without optimisations:; ```; $ clang++ test.cpp -o test.ll -emit-llvm -S -g -O0 -Xclang -fexperimental-assignment-tracking; ```; we get:; ```; define dso_local noundef i32 @_Z3funi(i32 noundef %a) #0 !dbg !8 {; entry:; %a.addr = alloca i32, align 4, !DIAssignID !13; call void @llvm.dbg.assign(metadata i1 undef, metadata !14, metadata !DIExpression(), metadata !13, metadata i32* %a.addr, metadata !DIExpression()), !dbg !15; store i32 %a, i32* %a.addr, align 4, !DIAssignID !16; call void @llvm.dbg.assign(metadata i32 %a, metadata !14, metadata !DIExpression(), metadata !16, metadata i32* %a.addr, metadata !DIExpression()), !dbg !15; %0 = load i32, i32* %a.addr, align 4, !dbg !17; ret i32 %0, !dbg !18; }. ...; !13 = distinct !DIAssignID(); !14 = !DILocalVariable(name: ""a"", ...); ...; !16 = distinct !DIAssignID(); ```. The first `llvm.dbg.assign` refers to the `alloca` through `!DIAssignID !13`,; and the second refers to the `store` through `!DIAssignID !16`. ### Store-like instruction",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md:4264,test,test,4264,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AssignmentTracking.md,1,['test'],['test']

This was a whirlwind tour of this code,; and it is somewhat subtle. I recommend running through it with a few; tough examples to see how it works. This wraps up handling of expressions. At this point, we can point the; parser at an arbitrary token stream and build an expression from it,; stopping at the first token that is not part of the expression. Next up; we need to handle function definitions, etc. Parsing the Rest; ================. The next thing missing is handling of function prototypes. In; Kaleidoscope, these are used both for 'extern' function declarations as; well as function body definitions. The code to do this is; straight-forward and not very interesting (once you've survived; expressions):. .. code-block:: c++. /// prototype; /// ::= id '(' id* ')'; static std::unique_ptr<PrototypeAST> ParsePrototype() {; if (CurTok != tok_identifier); return LogErrorP(""Expected function name in prototype"");. std::string FnName = IdentifierStr;; getNextToken();. if (CurTok != '('); return LogErrorP(""Expected '(' in prototype"");. // Read the list of argument names.; std::vector<std::string> ArgNames;; while (getNextToken() == tok_identifier); ArgNames.push_back(IdentifierStr);; if (CurTok != ')'); return LogErrorP(""Expected ')' in prototype"");. // success.; getNextToken(); // eat ')'. return std::make_unique<PrototypeAST>(FnName, std::move(ArgNames));; }. Given this, a function definition is very simple, just a prototype plus; an expression to implement the body:. .. code-block:: c++. /// definition ::= 'def' prototype expression; static std::unique_ptr<FunctionAST> ParseDefinition() {; getNextToken(); // eat def.; auto Proto = ParsePrototype();; if (!Proto) return nullptr;. if (auto E = ParseExpression()); return std::make_unique<FunctionAST>(std::move(Proto), std::move(E));; return nullptr;; }.

It cannot be; used directly as a piece of the geometry, but just as a temporary; structure helping temporary assembling and positioning volumes. If we define now `C` as an assembly containing `A` and `B`, positioning; the assembly into `D,E` and `F` will actually position only `A` and; `B `directly into these volumes, taking into account their combined; transformations `A/B` to `C` and `C` to `D/E/F`. This looks much nicer,; is it? In fact, it is and it is not. Of course, we managed to get rid of; the ‘unnecessary' volume `C` in our geometry, but we end-up with a more; flat structure for `D,E` and `F` (more daughters inside). This can get; much worse when extensively used, as in the case: assemblies of; assemblies. For deciding what to choose between using virtual containers or; assemblies for a specific case, one can use for both cases, after the; geometry was closed:. ``` {.cpp}; gGeoManager->SetTopVolume(ptr_D);; gGeoManager->Test();; gGeoManager->RestoreMasterVolume();; ```. The `ptr_D` is a pointer to volume `D` containing the interesting; structure. The test will provide the timing for classifying 1 million; random points inside `D`. #### Examples of Volume Positioning. Now let us make a simple volume representing a copper wire. We suppose; that a medium is already created (see **`TGeoMedium`** class on how to; create media). We will create a `TUBE` shape for our wire, having `Rmin=0cm`,; `Rmax=0.01cm` and a half-length `dZ=1cm`:. ``` {.cpp}; TGeoTube *tube = new TGeoTube(""wire_tube"",0,0.01,1);; ```. One may omit the name for the shape `wire_tube,` if no retrieving by; name is further needed during geometry building. Different volumes; having different names and materials can share the same shape. Now let's make the volume for our wire:. ``` {.cpp}; TGeoVolume *wire_co = new TGeoVolume(""WIRE_CO"",tube,; ptrCOPPER); //(*); ```. **(\*)** Do not bother to delete the media, shapes or volumes that you; have ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md:72708,Test,Test,72708,documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Geometry.md,1,['Test'],['Test']

Corpus; ------. Coverage-guided fuzzers like libFuzzer rely on a corpus of sample inputs for the; code under test. This corpus should ideally be seeded with a varied collection; of valid and invalid inputs for the code under test; for example, for a graphics; library the initial corpus might hold a variety of different small PNG/JPG/GIF; files. The fuzzer generates random mutations based around the sample inputs in; the current corpus. If a mutation triggers execution of a previously-uncovered; path in the code under test, then that mutation is saved to the corpus for; future variations. LibFuzzer will work without any initial seeds, but will be less; efficient if the library under test accepts complex,; structured inputs. The corpus can also act as a sanity/regression check, to confirm that the; fuzzing entrypoint still works and that all of the sample inputs run through; the code under test without problems. If you have a large corpus (either generated by fuzzing or acquired by other means); you may want to minimize it while still preserving the full coverage. One way to do that; is to use the `-merge=1` flag:. .. code-block:: console. mkdir NEW_CORPUS_DIR # Store minimized corpus here.; ./my_fuzzer -merge=1 NEW_CORPUS_DIR FULL_CORPUS_DIR. You may use the same flag to add more interesting items to an existing corpus.; Only the inputs that trigger new coverage will be added to the first corpus. .. code-block:: console. ./my_fuzzer -merge=1 CURRENT_CORPUS_DIR NEW_POTENTIALLY_INTERESTING_INPUTS_DIR. Running; -------. To run the fuzzer, first create a Corpus_ directory that holds the; initial ""seed"" sample inputs:. .. code-block:: console. mkdir CORPUS_DIR; cp /some/input/samples/* CORPUS_DIR.

The summary is that mitigating with load hardening is 1.77x faster than; mitigating with `lfence`, and the overhead of load hardening compared to a; normal program is likely between a 10% overhead and a 50% overhead with most; large applications seeing a 30% overhead or less. | Benchmark | `lfence` | Load Hardening | Mitigated Speedup |; | -------------------------------------- | -------: | -------------: | ----------------: |; | Google microbenchmark suite | -74.8% | -36.4% | **2.5x** |; | Large server QPS (using ThinLTO & PGO) | -62% | -29% | **1.8x** |.

Testability,"script>; // getting json string from somewhere; let obj = JSROOT.parse(root_json);; JSROOT.draw('plain', obj, 'colz');; </script>; ```. ### Use of JSON. It is strongly recommended to use JSON when communicating with ROOT application.; THttpServer provides a JSON representation for every registered object with an url address like:. http://your_root_server:8080/Canvases/c1/root.json. Such JSON representation generated using the [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTBufferJSON.html) class. One could create JSON file for any ROOT object directly, just writing in the code:. ```cpp; obj->SaveAs(""file.json"");; ```. To access data from a remote web server, it is recommended to use the `httpRequest` method.; For instance to receive object from a THttpServer server one could do:. ```javascript; import { httpRequest } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let obj = await httpRequest(""http://your_root_server:8080/Canvases/c1/root.json"", ""object""); console.log('Read object of type', obj._typename);; ```. Function returns Promise, which provides parsed object (or Error in case of failure). If JSON string was obtained by different method, it could be parsed with `parse` function:. ```javascript; import { parse } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; let obj = parse(json_string);; ```. ### Objects drawing. After an object has been created, one can directly draw it. If HTML page has `<div>` element:. ```html; <div id=""drawing""></div>; ```. One could use the `draw` function:. ```javascript; import { draw } from 'https://root.cern/js/latest/modules/main.mjs';; draw(""drawing"", obj, ""colz"");; ```. The first argument is the id of the HTML div element, where drawing will be performed. The second argument is the object to draw and the third one is the drawing option.

Better to use:; ``target={{.+-freebsd.*}} || target={{.+-netbsd.*}}``. Substitutions; -------------. Besides replacing LLVM tool names the following substitutions are performed in; RUN lines:. ``%%``; Replaced by a single ``%``. This allows escaping other substitutions. ``%s``; File path to the test case's source. This is suitable for passing on the; command line as the input to an LLVM tool. Example: ``/home/user/llvm/test/MC/ELF/foo_test.s``. ``%S``; Directory path to the test case's source. Example: ``/home/user/llvm/test/MC/ELF``. ``%t``; File path to a temporary file name that could be used for this test case.; The file name won't conflict with other test cases. You can append to it; if you need multiple temporaries. This is useful as the destination of; some redirected output. Example: ``/home/user/llvm.build/test/MC/ELF/Output/foo_test.s.tmp``. ``%T``; Directory of ``%t``. Deprecated. Shouldn't be used, because it can be easily; misused and cause race conditions between tests. Use ``rm -rf %t && mkdir %t`` instead if a temporary directory is necessary. Example: ``/home/user/llvm.build/test/MC/ELF/Output``. ``%{pathsep}``. Expands to the path separator, i.e. ``:`` (or ``;`` on Windows). ``${fs-src-root}``; Expands to the root component of file system paths for the source directory,; i.e. ``/`` on Unix systems or ``C:\`` (or another drive) on Windows. ``${fs-tmp-root}``; Expands to the root component of file system paths for the test's temporary; directory, i.e. ``/`` on Unix systems or ``C:\`` (or another drive) on; Windows. ``${fs-sep}``; Expands to the file system separator, i.e. ``/`` or ``\`` on Windows. ``%/s, %/S, %/t, %/T``.

Testability,"se AFL on your target function ``LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput``:; see an example `here <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/afl>`__. How good is my fuzzer?; ----------------------. Once you implement your target function ``LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`` and fuzz it to death,; you will want to know whether the function or the corpus can be improved further.; One easy to use metric is, of course, code coverage. We recommend to use; `Clang Coverage <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html>`_,; to visualize and study your code coverage; (`example <https://github.com/google/fuzzer-test-suite/blob/master/tutorial/libFuzzerTutorial.md#visualizing-coverage>`_). User-supplied mutators; ----------------------. LibFuzzer allows to use custom (user-supplied) mutators, see; `Structure-Aware Fuzzing <https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/docs/structure-aware-fuzzing.md>`_; for more details. Startup initialization; ----------------------; If the library being tested needs to be initialized, there are several options. The simplest way is to have a statically initialized global object inside; `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` (or in global scope if that works for you):. .. code-block:: c++. extern ""C"" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) {; static bool Initialized = DoInitialization();; ... Alternatively, you may define an optional init function and it will receive; the program arguments that you can read and modify. Do this **only** if you; really need to access ``argv``/``argc``. .. code-block:: c++. extern ""C"" int LLVMFuzzerInitialize(int *argc, char ***argv) {; ReadAndMaybeModify(argc, argv);; return 0;; }.

Usually it is able to reduce a test program to a single function, when; debugging intraprocedural optimizations. Once the number of functions has been; reduced, it attempts to delete various edges in the control flow graph, to; reduce the size of the function as much as possible. Finally, ``bugpoint``; deletes any individual LLVM instructions whose absence does not eliminate the; failure. At the end, ``bugpoint`` should tell you what passes crash, give you a; bitcode file, and give you instructions on how to reproduce the failure with; ``opt`` or ``llc``. .. _code generator debugger:.

To do this, it takes the test; program and partitions it into two pieces: one piece which it compiles with the; ""safe"" backend (into a shared object), and one piece which it runs with either; the JIT or the static LLC compiler. It uses several techniques to reduce the; amount of code pushed through the LLVM code generator, to reduce the potential; scope of the problem. After it is finished, it emits two bitcode files (called; ""test"" [to be compiled with the code generator] and ""safe"" [to be compiled with; the ""safe"" backend], respectively), and instructions for reproducing the; problem. The code generator debugger assumes that the ""safe"" backend produces; good code. .. _miscompilation debugger:. Miscompilation debugger; -----------------------. The miscompilation debugger works similarly to the code generator debugger. It; works by splitting the test program into two pieces, running the optimizations; specified on one piece, linking the two pieces back together, and then executing; the result.

Testability,"se of the; use of the ``%free`` anchor intrinsic. In practice, they almost certainly have to be non-converged dynamic; instances. Consider that if an implementation strictly follows the order of; instructions given in the program, the executions of the threads can be; ""aligned"" as follows:. .. code-block:: text. Thread 1: A B C D F B D E F G; Thread 2: A B D E F B C D F G. So then ``@op.2(1)`` physically executes later than ``@op.2(2)`` and there; can be no communication between the threads, which means they execute; non-converged dynamic instances. That said, it is conceivable that there aren't actually any data or other; dependencies that would enforce this execution order. In that case, a highly; out-of-order implementation could potentially allow communication. That's; why the rules defined in this document are silent about whether; ``@op.2(1) == @op.2(2)`` or not. This type of convergence control seems relatively unlikely to appear in real; programs. Its possibility is simply a logical consequence of the model. An equivalent issue arises if the convergent operations are replaced by nested; loops with loop heart intrinsics that directly refer to ``%anchor``, hence; the variants of the static rules about cycles that apply to them:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; WARNING: Example of incorrect convergence control!. %anchor = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.anchor(); for (;;) {; if (condition1) {; for (;;) {; %loop1 = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.loop() [ ""convergencectrl""(token %anchor) ]; }; }; if (condition2) {; for (;;) {; %loop2 = call token @llvm.experimental.convergence.loop() [ ""convergencectrl""(token %anchor) ]; }; }; }.

In this case, all of the following tests are treated as ``XFAIL``:. .. code-block:: none. libomp :: affinity/kmp-hw-subset.c; libomptarget :: nvptx64-nvidia-cuda :: offloading/memory_manager.cpp; libomptarget :: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu :: offloading/memory_manager.cpp. Alternatively, a test name can be specified as the full test name; reported in LIT output. For example, we can adjust the previous; example not to treat the ``nvptx64-nvidia-cuda`` version of; ``offloading/memory_manager.cpp`` as XFAIL:. .. code-block:: none. LIT_XFAIL=""affinity/kmp-hw-subset.c;libomptarget :: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu :: offloading/memory_manager.cpp"". .. option:: --xfail-not=LIST. Do not treat the specified tests as ``XFAIL``. The environment variable; ``LIT_XFAIL_NOT`` can also be used in place of this option. The syntax is the; same as for :option:`--xfail` and ``LIT_XFAIL``. :option:`--xfail-not` and; ``LIT_XFAIL_NOT`` always override all other ``XFAIL`` specifications,; including an :option:`--xfail` appearing later on the command line.

Testability,"sense. Doing so makes it; basically impossible to support C like languages. Besides that,; certifying a register based language as safe at run time would be a; pretty expensive operation to have to do. Additionally, we would like; to be able to statically eliminate many bounds checks in Java; programs... for example. 2. Instead, we can do the following (eventually): ; * Java bytecode is used as our ""safe"" representation (to avoid; reinventing something that we don't add much value to). When the; user chooses to execute Java bytecodes directly (ie, not; precompiled) the runtime compiler can do some very simple; transformations (JIT style) to convert it into valid input for our; VM. Performance is not wonderful, but it works right.; * The file is scheduled to be compiled (rigorously) at a later; time. This could be done by some background process or by a second; processor in the system during idle time or something...; * To keep things ""safe"" ie to enforce a sandbox on Java/foreign code,; we could sign the generated VM code with a host specific private; key. Then before the code is executed/loaded, we can check to see if; the trusted compiler generated the code. This would be much quicker; than having to validate consistency (especially if bounds checks have; been removed, for example). > This is important because the audiences for these two goals are very; > different. Architects and many compiler people care much more about; > the second question. The Java compiler and OS community care much more; > about the first one. 3. By focusing on a more low level virtual machine, we have much more room; for value add. The nice safe ""sandbox"" VM can be provided as a layer; on top of it. It also lets us focus on the more interesting compilers; related projects. > 2. Design issues to consider (an initial list that we should continue; > to modify).

Testability,"ses the question:; if the returned value is smaller than the register, what do the high bits hold?. There are three (interesting) possible answers: undefined, zero extended, or; sign extended. The number of bits in question depends on the data-type that; the front-end is referencing (typically i1/i8/i16/i32). Knowing the answer to this is important for two reasons: 1) we want to be able; to implement the ABI correctly. If we need to sign extend the result according; to the ABI, we really really do need to do this to preserve correctness. 2); this information is often useful for optimization purposes, and we want the; mid-level optimizers to be able to process this (e.g. eliminate redundant; extensions). For example, lets pretend that X86 requires the caller to properly extend the; result of a return (I'm not sure this is the case, but the argument doesn't; depend on this). Given this, we should compile this:. int a();; short b() { return a(); }. into:. _b:; 	subl	$12, %esp; 	call	L_a$stub; 	addl	$12, %esp; 	cwtl; 	ret. An optimization example is that we should be able to eliminate the explicit; sign extension in this example:. short y();; int z() {; return ((int)y() << 16) >> 16;; }. _z:; 	subl	$12, %esp; 	call	_y; 	;; movswl %ax, %eax -> not needed because eax is already sext'd; 	addl	$12, %esp; 	ret. //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//; // What we have right now.; //===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//. Currently, these sorts of things are modelled by compiling a function to return; the small type and a signext/zeroext marker is used. For example, we compile; Z into:. define i32 @z() nounwind {; entry:; 	%0 = tail call signext i16 (...)* @y() nounwind; 	%1 = sext i16 %0 to i32; 	ret i32 %1; }. and b into:. define signext i16 @b() nounwind {; entry:; 	%0 = tail call i32 (...)* @a() nounwind		; <i32> [#uses=1]; 	%retval12 = trunc i32 %0 to i16		; <i16> [#uses=1]; 	ret i16 %retval1",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExtendedIntegerResults.txt:1387,stub,stub,1387,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExtendedIntegerResults.txt,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExtendedIntegerResults.txt,1,['stub'],['stub']

Testability,"sets corresponding to addresses within a given set of globals. LLVM's; `control flow integrity`_ implementation uses this metadata to efficiently; check (at each call site) that a given address corresponds to either a; valid vtable or function pointer for a given class or function type, and its; whole-program devirtualization pass uses the metadata to identify potential; callees for a given virtual call. To use the mechanism, a client creates metadata nodes with two elements:. 1. a byte offset into the global (generally zero for functions); 2. a metadata object representing an identifier for the type. These metadata nodes are associated with globals by using global object; metadata attachments with the ``!type`` metadata kind. Each type identifier must exclusively identify either global variables; or functions. .. admonition:: Limitation. The current implementation only supports attaching metadata to functions on; the x86-32 and x86-64 architectures.

The same applies to the; main development branch. It is therefore important to ensure the ``llvm-spirv``; version is in alignment with the Clang version. For troubleshooting purposes; ``llvm-spirv`` can be `tested in isolation; <https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator#test-instructions>`_. Example usage for OpenCL kernel compilation:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=spirv32 -c test.cl; $ clang --target=spirv64 -c test.cl. Both invocations of Clang will result in the generation of a SPIR-V binary file; `test.o` for 32 bit and 64 bit respectively. This file can be imported; by an OpenCL driver that support SPIR-V consumption or it can be compiled; further by offline SPIR-V consumer tools. Converting to SPIR-V produced with the optimization levels other than `-O0` is; currently available as an experimental feature and it is not guaranteed to work; in all cases. Clang also supports integrated generation of SPIR-V without use of ``llvm-spirv``; tool as an experimental feature when ``-fintegrated-objemitter`` flag is passed in; the command line. .. code-block:: console. $ clang --target=spirv32 -fintegrated-objemitter -c test.cl.

Testability,"sions as the JIT'd code no longer changes, only the; absolute symbol definition does. For process and library symbols the DynamicLibrarySearchGenerator utility (See; :ref:`How to Add Process and Library Symbols to JITDylibs; <ProcessAndLibrarySymbols>`) can be used to automatically build absolute; symbol mappings for you. However the absoluteSymbols function is still useful; for making non-global objects in your JIT visible to JIT'd code. For example,; imagine that your JIT standard library needs access to your JIT object to make; some calls. We could bake the address of your object into the library, but then; it would need to be recompiled for each session:. .. code-block:: c++. // From standard library for JIT'd code:. class MyJIT {; public:; void log(const char *Msg);; };. void log(const char *Msg) { ((MyJIT*)0x1234)->log(Msg); }. We can turn this into a symbolic reference in the JIT standard library:. .. code-block:: c++. extern MyJIT *__MyJITInstance;. void log(const char *Msg) { __MyJITInstance->log(Msg); }. And then make our JIT object visible to the JIT standard library with an; absolute symbol definition when the JIT is started:. .. code-block:: c++. MyJIT J = ...;. auto &JITStdLibJD = ... ;. JITStdLibJD.define(absoluteSymbols(SymbolMap({; { Mangle(""__MyJITInstance""),; { ExecutorAddr::fromPtr(&J), JITSymbolFlags() } }; });. Aliases and Reexports; ---------------------. Aliases and reexports allow you to define new symbols that map to existing; symbols. This can be useful for changing linkage relationships between symbols; across sessions without having to recompile code. For example, imagine that; JIT'd code has access to a log function, ``void log(const char*)`` for which; there are two implementations in the JIT standard library: ``log_fast`` and; ``log_detailed``. Your JIT can choose which one of these definitions will be; used when the ``log`` symbol is referenced by setting up an alias at JIT startup; time:. .. code-block:: c++. auto &JITStdLibJD = ...",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst:14724,log,log,14724,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ORCv2.rst,2,['log'],['log']

Once the PassManager is set up, we need to make use of it. We do this by; running it after our newly created function is constructed (in; ``FunctionAST::codegen()``), but before it is returned to the client:. .. code-block:: c++. if (Value *RetVal = Body->codegen()) {; // Finish off the function.; Builder.CreateRet(RetVal);. // Validate the generated code, checking for consistency.; verifyFunction(*TheFunction);. // Optimize the function.; TheFPM->run(*TheFunction, *TheFAM);. return TheFunction;; }. As you can see, this is pretty straightforward. The; ``FunctionPassManager`` optimizes and updates the LLVM Function\* in; place, improving (hopefully) its body.

Some `documentation about the various; passes <../../Passes.html>`_ is available, but it isn't very complete.; Another good source of ideas can come from looking at the passes that; ``Clang`` runs to get started.

Testability,"sitives by pruning off; false paths.; In order to exploit assertions, however, the analyzer must understand when it; encounters an ""assertion handler."" Typically assertions are; implemented with a macro, with the macro performing a check for the assertion; condition and, when the check fails, calling an assertion handler. For example, consider the following code; fragment:. void foo(int *p) {; assert(p != NULL);; }. When this code is preprocessed on Mac OS X it expands to the following:. void foo(int *p) {; (__builtin_expect(!(p != NULL), 0) ? __assert_rtn(__func__, ""t.c"", 4, ""p != NULL"") : (void)0);; }. In this example, the assertion handler is __assert_rtn. When called,; most assertion handlers typically print an error and terminate the program. The; analyzer can exploit such semantics by ending the analysis of a path once it; hits a call to an assertion handler.; The trick, however, is that the analyzer needs to know that a called function; is an assertion handler; otherwise the analyzer might assume the function call; returns and it will continue analyzing the path where the assertion condition; failed. This can lead to false positives, as the assertion condition usually; implies a safety condition (e.g., a pointer is not null) prior to performing; some action that depends on that condition (e.g., dereferencing a pointer).; The analyzer knows about several well-known assertion handlers, but can; automatically infer if a function should be treated as an assertion handler if; it is annotated with the 'noreturn' attribute or the (Clang-specific); 'analyzer_noreturn' attribute. Note that, currently, clang does not support; these attributes on Objective-C methods and C++ methods.; Attribute 'noreturn'; The 'noreturn' attribute is a GCC-attribute that can be placed on the; declarations of functions.
