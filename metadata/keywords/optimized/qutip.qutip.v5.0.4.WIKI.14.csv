You should re-run this any time you make changes, and it should only update files that have been changed. Important; The documentation build includes running almost all the optional features of QuTiP.; If you get failure messages in red, make sure you have installed all of the optional dependencies for the main library. The HTML files will be placed in the _build/html directory.; You can open the file _build/html/index.html in your web browser to check the output. Code Style¶; All user guide pages and docstrings are parsed by Sphinx using reStructuredText.; There is a general Sphinx usage guide, which has a lot of information that can sometimes be a little tricky to follow.; It may be easier just to look at other .rst files already in the documentation to copy the different styles. Note; reStructuredText is a very different language to the Markdown that you might be familiar with.; It’s always worth checking your work in a web browser to make sure it’s appeared the way you intended. Testing¶; There are unfortunately no automated tests for the documentation.; You should ensure that no errors appeared in red when you ran make html.; Try not to introduce any new warnings during the build process.; The main test is to open the HTML pages you have built (open _build/html/index.html in your web browser), and click through to the relevant pages to make sure everything has rendered the way you expected it to.

Testability," by using these optimized tools. As these libraries are multi-threaded, you can change the number of threads used in these packages by adding:; >>> import os; >>> os.environ['OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS'] = '4'; >>> os.environ['MKL_NUM_THREADS'] = '4'. at the top of your Python script files, or iPython notebooks, and then loading the QuTiP framework. If these commands are not present, then QuTiP automatically sets the number of threads to one. Verifying the Installation¶; QuTiP includes a collection of built-in test scripts to verify that an installation was successful. To run the suite of tests scripts you must have the nose testing library. After installing QuTiP, leave the installation directory, run Python (or iPython), and call:; >>> import qutip.testing as qt; >>> qt.run(). If successful, these tests indicate that all of the QuTiP functions are working properly. If any errors occur, please check that you have installed all of the required modules. See the next section on how to check the installed versions of the QuTiP dependencies. If these tests still fail, then head on over to the QuTiP Discussion Board and post a message detailing your particular issue.

Testability," directives while making a user guide. Doctest¶; The doctest directive enables tests on interactive code examples.; The simplest way to do this is by specifying a prompt along with its respective output:; .. doctest::. >>> a = 2; >>> a; 2. This is rendered in the documentation as follows:; >>> a = 2; >>> a; 2. While specifying code examples under the .. doctest:: directive, either all statements must be specified by the >>> prompt or without it.; For every prompt, any potential corresponding output must be specified immediately after it.; This directive is ideally used when there are a number of examples that need to be checked in quick succession.; A different way to specify code examples (and test them) is using the associated .. testcode:: directive which is effectively a code block:; .. testcode::. a = 2; print(a). followed by its results.; The result can be specified with the .. testoutput:: block:; .. testoutput::. 2. The advantage of the testcode directive is that it is a lot simpler to; specify and amenable to copying the code to clipboard. Usually, tests are; more easily specified with this directive as the input and output are; specified in different blocks. The rendering is neater too. Note; The doctest and testcode directives should not be assumed to; have the same namespace. Output:; a = 2; print(a). 2. A few notes on using the doctest extension:. By default, each testcode and doctest block is run in a fresh namespace.; To share a common namespace, we can specify a common group across the blocks; (within a single .rst file). For example,; .. doctest:: [group_name]. >>> a = 2. can be followed by some explanation followed by another code block; sharing the same namespace; .. doctest:: [group_name]. >>> print(a); 2. To only print the code blocks (or the output), use the option +SKIP to; specify the block without the code being tested when running make doctest.; To check the result of a Qobj output, it is useful to make sure that; spacing irregularities betw",MatchSource.WIKI,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org/docs/4.6/development/docs.html:2337,test,testcode,2337,docs/4.6/development/docs.html,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.6/development/docs.html,2,['test'],['testcode']

Installation on Mac OS X (10.8+)¶. Setup Using Homebrew¶; The latest version of QuTiP can be quickly installed on OS X using Homebrew and the automated installation shell scripts. Python 2.7 installation script; Python 3.4 installation script. Having downloaded the script corresponding to the version of Python you want to use, the installation script can be run from the terminal using (replacing X with 2 or 3); sh install_qutip_pyX.sh. The script will then install Homebrew and the required QuTiP dependencies before installing QuTiP itself and running the built in test suite. Any errors in the homebrew configuration will be displayed at the end. Using Python 2.7 or 3.4, the python commend-line and IPython interpreter can be run by calling python and ipython or python3 and ipython3, respectively.; If you have installed other packages in the /usr/local/ directory, or have changed the permissions of any of its sub-directories, then this script may fail to install all the necessary tools automatically. Setup Using Macports¶; If you have not done so already, install the Apple Xcode developer tools from the Apple App Store. After installation, open Xcode and go to: Preferences -> Downloads, and install the ‘Command Line Tools’.; On the Mac OS, you can install the required libraries via MacPorts. After installation, the necessary “ports” for QuTiP may be installed via (Replace ‘34’ with ‘27’ if you want Python 2.7); sudo port install py34-scipy; sudo port install py34-matplotlib +latex; sudo p",MatchSource.WIKI,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/installation.html:7129,test,test,7129,docs/3.1.0/installation.html,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/installation.html,1,['test'],['test']

We hope that by using TensorFlow we might enable QuTiP to scale; to bigger quantum systems (e.g. more qubits) and decrease the time taken to; simulate them.; There is particular interest in trying the new backend with the; BoFiN HEOM (Hierarchical Equations of Motion) solver 2. Challenges¶; TensorFlow is a very different kind of computational framework to the existing; dense and sparse matrix backends. It uses flow graphs to describe operations,; and to work efficiently. Ideally large graphs of operations need to be; executed together in order to efficiently compute results.; The QuTiP data layer might need to be adjusted to accommodate these; differences, and it is possible that this will prove challenging or even; that we will not find a reasonable way to achieve the desired performance. Expected outcomes¶. Add a qutip.core.data.tensorflow data type.; Implement specialisations for some important operations (e.g. add,; mul, matmul, eigen, etc).; Write a small benchmark to show how Qobj operations scale on the new; backend in comparison to the existing backends. Run the benchmark both; with and without using a GPU.; Implement enough for a solver to run on top of the new TensorFlow data; backend and benchmark that (stretch goal). Skills¶. Git, Python and familiarity with the Python scientific computing stack; Familiarity with TensorFlow (beneficial, but not required); Familiarity with Cython (beneficial, but not required).

Testability," in the conf.py file. Directives¶; There are two Sphinx directives that can be used to write code examples in the user guide:. Doctest; Plot. For a more comprehensive account of the usage of each directive, please refer to their individual pages. Here we outline some general guidelines on how to these directives while making a user guide. Doctest¶; The doctest directive enables tests on interactive code examples.; The simplest way to do this is by specifying a prompt along with its respective output:; .. doctest::. >>> a = 2; >>> a; 2. This is rendered in the documentation as follows:; >>> a = 2; >>> a; 2. While specifying code examples under the .. doctest:: directive, either all statements must be specified by the >>> prompt or without it.; For every prompt, any potential corresponding output must be specified immediately after it.; This directive is ideally used when there are a number of examples that need to be checked in quick succession.; A different way to specify code examples (and test them) is using the associated .. testcode:: directive which is effectively a code block:; .. testcode::. a = 2; print(a). followed by its results.; The result can be specified with the .. testoutput:: block:; .. testoutput::. 2. The advantage of the testcode directive is that it is a lot simpler to; specify and amenable to copying the code to clipboard. Usually, tests are; more easily specified with this directive as the input and output are; specified in different blocks. The rendering is neater too. Note; The doctest and testcode directives should not be assumed to; have the same namespace. Output:; a = 2; print(a). 2. A few notes on using the doctest extension:. By default, each testcode and doctest block is run in a fresh namespace.; To share a common namespace, we can specify a common group across the blocks; (within a single .rst file). For example,; .. doctest:: [group_name]. >>> a = 2. can be followed by some explanation followed by another code block; sharing the sa",MatchSource.WIKI,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org/docs/4.6/development/docs.html:2082,test,test,2082,docs/4.6/development/docs.html,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.6/development/docs.html,2,['test'],['test']

Installing from Source¶; Official releases of QuTiP are available from the download section on the project’s web pages. http://www.qutip.org/download.html; and the latest source code is available in our Github repository. http://github.com/qutip; In general we recommend users to use the latest stable release of QuTiP, but if you are interested in helping us out with development or wish to submit bug fixes, then use the latest development version from the Github repository.; Installing QuTiP from source requires that all the dependencies are satisfied. To install QuTiP from the source code run:; sudo python setup.py install. To also include the optional Fortran Monte Carlo solver, run:; sudo python setup.py install --with-f90mc. On Windows, omit sudo from the commands given above. Verifying the Installation¶; QuTiP includes a collection of built-in test scripts to verify that an installation was successful. To run the suite of tests scripts you must have the nose testing library. After installing QuTiP, leave the installation directory, run Python (or iPython), and call:; import qutip.testing as qt; qt.run(). If successful, these tests indicate that all of the QuTiP functions are working properly. If any errors occur, please check that you have installed all of the required modules. See the next section on how to check the installed versions of the QuTiP dependencies. If these tests still fail, then head on over to the QuTiP Discussion Board and post a message detailing your particular issue. Checking Version Information using the About Function¶; QuTiP includes an “about” function for viewing information about QuTiP and the important dependencies installed on your system.

Testability," method does not support all time-dependent coefficients that one can think of, it does support essentially all problems that one would typically encounter. Time-dependent coefficients using any of the following functions, or combinations thereof (including constants) can be compiled directly into C-code:; 'abs', 'acos', 'acosh', 'arg', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atan2', 'atanh', 'conj',; 'cos', 'cosh','exp', 'imag', 'log', 'pow', 'proj, 'real', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt',; 'tan', 'tanh'. If you require mathematical functions other than those listed above, than it is possible to call any of the functions in the numpy math library using the prefix np. before the function name in the string, i.e 'np.sin(t)'. The available functions can be found using; In [1]: import numpy as np. In [2]: np.array(dir(np.math)[6:]); Out[2]: ; array(['asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atan2', 'atanh', 'ceil', 'copysign',; 'cos', 'cosh', 'degrees', 'e', 'erf', 'erfc', 'exp', 'expm1',; 'fabs', 'factorial', 'floor', 'fmod', 'frexp', 'fsum', 'gamma',; 'hypot', 'isinf', 'isnan', 'ldexp', 'lgamma', 'log', 'log10',; 'log1p', 'modf', 'pi', 'pow', 'radians', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt',; 'tan', 'tanh', 'trunc'], ; dtype='|S9'). Finally option #3, expressing the Hamiltonian as a Python function, is the original method for time dependence in QuTiP 1.x. However, this method is somewhat less efficient then the previously mentioned methods, and does not allow for time-dependent collapse operators. However, in contrast to options #1 and #2, this method can be used in implementing time-dependent Hamiltonians that cannot be expressed as a function of constant operators with time-dependent coefficients.; A collection of examples demonstrating the simulation of time-dependent problems can be found on the tutorials web page.

Testability," scratch, then we would probably chose another; name for the main qutip library, such as qutip-quantdyn. However, qutip is; famous, and the name will stay. Library package structure¶; With a name as general as Quantum Toolkit in Python, the scope for new code; modules to be added to qutip is very wide. The library was becoming increasingly; difficult to maintain, and in c. 2020 the QuTiP Admim Team decided to limit the; scope of the ‘main’ (for want of a better name) qutip package. This scope is; restricted to components for the simulation (solving) of the dynamics of quantum; systems. The scope includes utilities to support this, including analysis and; visualisation of output.; At the same time, again with the intention of easing maintence, a decision to; limit dependences was agreed upon. Main qutip runtime code components should; depend only upon Numpy and Scipy. Installation (from source) requires Cython,; and some optional components also require Cython at runtime. Unit testing; requires Pytest. Visualisation (optional) components require Matplotlib.; Due to the all encompassing nature of the plan to abstract the linear algebra; data layer, this enhancement (developed as part of a GSoC project) was allowed; the freedom (potential for non-backward compatibility) of requiring a major; release. The timing of such allows for a restructuring of the qutip compoments,; such that some that could be deemed out of scope could be packaged in a; different way – that is, not installed as part of the main qutip package. Hence; the proposal for different types of package described next. With reference to; the discussion above on the name QuTiP/qutip, the planned; restructuring suffers from confusing naming, which seems unavoidable without; remaining either the organisation or the main package (neither of which are; desirable).

Testability," source code is available in our Github repository. http://github.com/qutip; In general we recommend users to use the latest stable release of QuTiP, but if you are interested in helping us out with development or wish to submit bug fixes, then use the latest development version from the Github repository.; Installing QuTiP from source requires that all the dependencies are satisfied. To install QuTiP from the source code run:; sudo python setup.py install. To also include the optional Fortran Monte Carlo solver, run:; sudo python setup.py install --with-f90mc. On Windows, omit sudo from the commands given above. Verifying the Installation¶; QuTiP includes a collection of built-in test scripts to verify that an installation was successful. To run the suite of tests scripts you must have the nose testing library. After installing QuTiP, leave the installation directory, run Python (or iPython), and call:; import qutip.testing as qt; qt.run(). If successful, these tests indicate that all of the QuTiP functions are working properly. If any errors occur, please check that you have installed all of the required modules. See the next section on how to check the installed versions of the QuTiP dependencies. If these tests still fail, then head on over to the QuTiP Discussion Board and post a message detailing your particular issue. Checking Version Information using the About Function¶; QuTiP includes an “about” function for viewing information about QuTiP and the important dependencies installed on your system. To view this information:; In [1]: from qutip import *. In [2]: about(). Installation on MS Windows¶; We are recommending and supporting installation of QuTiP into a Conda environment. Other scientific Python implementations such as Python-xy may also work.; QuTiP uses dynamic compilation of C for some of its time-dependant dynamics solvers.

Testability," the user guide:. Doctest; Plot. For a more comprehensive account of the usage of each directive, please refer to their individual pages. Here we outline some general guidelines on how to these directives while making a user guide. Doctest¶; The doctest directive enables tests on interactive code examples.; The simplest way to do this is by specifying a prompt along with its respective output:; .. doctest::. >>> a = 2; >>> a; 2. This is rendered in the documentation as follows:; >>> a = 2; >>> a; 2. While specifying code examples under the .. doctest:: directive, either all statements must be specified by the >>> prompt or without it.; For every prompt, any potential corresponding output must be specified immediately after it.; This directive is ideally used when there are a number of examples that need to be checked in quick succession.; A different way to specify code examples (and test them) is using the associated .. testcode:: directive which is effectively a code block:; .. testcode::. a = 2; print(a). followed by its results.; The result can be specified with the .. testoutput:: block:; .. testoutput::. 2. The advantage of the testcode directive is that it is a lot simpler to; specify and amenable to copying the code to clipboard. Usually, tests are; more easily specified with this directive as the input and output are; specified in different blocks. The rendering is neater too. Note; The doctest and testcode directives should not be assumed to; have the same namespace. Output:; a = 2; print(a). 2. A few notes on using the doctest extension:. By default, each testcode and doctest block is run in a fresh namespace.; To share a common namespace, we can specify a common group across the blocks; (within a single .rst file). For example,; .. doctest:: [group_name]. >>> a = 2. can be followed by some explanation followed by another code block; sharing the same namespace; .. doctest:: [group_name]. >>> print(a); 2.

Optimized BLAS Libraries¶; QuTiP is designed to take advantage of some of the optimized BLAS libraries that are available for NumPy. At present, this includes the OPENBLAS and MKL libraries. If NumPy is built against these libraries, then QuTiP will take advantage of the performance gained by using these optimized tools. As these libraries are multi-threaded, you can change the number of threads used in these packages by adding:; >>> import os; >>> os.environ['OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS'] = '4'; >>> os.environ['MKL_NUM_THREADS'] = '4'. at the top of your Python script files, or iPython notebooks, and then loading the QuTiP framework. If these commands are not present, then QuTiP automatically sets the number of threads to one. Verifying the Installation¶; QuTiP includes a collection of built-in test scripts to verify that an installation was successful. To run the suite of tests scripts you must have the nose testing library. After installing QuTiP, leave the installation directory, run Python (or iPython), and call:; >>> import qutip.testing as qt; >>> qt.run(). If successful, these tests indicate that all of the QuTiP functions are working properly. If any errors occur, please check that you have installed all of the required modules. See the next section on how to check the installed versions of the QuTiP dependencies. If these tests still fail, then head on over to the QuTiP Discussion Board and post a message detailing your particular issue.

To run the suite of tests scripts you must have the nose testing library. After installing QuTiP, leave the installation directory, run Python (or iPython), and call:; >>> import qutip.testing as qt; >>> qt.run(). If successful, these tests indicate that all of the QuTiP functions are working properly. If any errors occur, please check that your have installed all of the required modules. See the next section on how to check the installed versions of the QuTiP dependencies. If these tests still fail, then head on over to the QuTiP Discussion Board and post a message detailing your particular issue. Checking Version Information using the About Function¶; QuTiP includes an “about” function for viewing information about QuTiP and the important dependencies installed on your system.

Testability," with time-dependence. Collapse operators must be time independent using this input format. Give the multiple choices of input style, the first question that arrises is which option to choose? In short, the function based method (option #1) is the most general, allowing for essentially arbitrary coefficients expressed via user defined functions. However, by automatically compiling your system into C code, the second option (string based) tends to be more efficient and will run faster. Of course, for small system sizes and evolution times, the difference will be minor. Although this method does not support all time-dependent coefficients that one can think of, it does support essentially all problems that one would typically encounter. If you can write you time-dependent coefficients using any of the following functions, or combinations thereof (including constants) then you may use this method:; 'acos', 'acosh', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atan2', 'atanh', 'ceil',; 'copysign', 'cos', 'cosh', 'degrees', 'erf', 'erfc', 'exp', 'expm1',; 'fabs', 'factorial', 'floor', 'fmod', 'frexp', 'fsum', 'gamma',; 'hypot', 'isinf', 'isnan', 'ldexp', 'lgamma', 'log', 'log10', 'log1p',; 'modf', 'pow', 'radians', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh', 'trunc'. Finally option #3, expressing the Hamiltonian as a Python function, is the original method for time dependence in QuTiP 1.x. However, this method is somewhat less efficient then the previously mentioned methods, and does not allow for time-dependent collapse operators. However, in contrast to options #1 and #2, this method can be used in implementing time-dependent Hamiltonians that cannot be expressed as a function of constant operators with time-dependent coefficients.; A collection of examples demonstrating the simulation of time-dependent problems can be found on the tutorials web page. Function Based Time Dependence¶; A very general way to write a time-dependent Hamiltonian or collapse operator is by using Python functions as th",MatchSource.WIKI,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html:4307,log,log,4307,docs/3.0.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html,2,['log'],['log']

Homodyne detection¶; Homodyne detection is an extension of the photocurrent method where the output; is mixed with a strong external source allowing to get information about the; phase of the system. With this method, the resulting detection rate depends is. \[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}:label: jump_rate\\\tau = tr \left((\gamma^2 + \gamma (C+C^\dag) + C^\dag C)\rho \right)\end{aligned}\end{align} \]; With \(\gamma\), the strength of the external beam and \(C\) the collapse; operator. When the beam is very strong \((\gamma >> C^\dag C)\),; the rate becomes a constant term plus a term proportional to the quadrature of; the system. Closed system¶; In closed systems, the resulting stochastic differential equation is.

Testability,"). followed by its results.; The result can be specified with the .. testoutput:: block:; .. testoutput::. 2. The advantage of the testcode directive is that it is a lot simpler to; specify and amenable to copying the code to clipboard. Usually, tests are; more easily specified with this directive as the input and output are; specified in different blocks. The rendering is neater too. Note; The doctest and testcode directives should not be assumed to; have the same namespace. Output:; a = 2; print(a). 2. A few notes on using the doctest extension:. By default, each testcode and doctest block is run in a fresh namespace.; To share a common namespace, we can specify a common group across the blocks; (within a single .rst file). For example,; .. doctest:: [group_name]. >>> a = 2. can be followed by some explanation followed by another code block; sharing the same namespace; .. doctest:: [group_name]. >>> print(a); 2.

Finally, the last superoperator representation supported by QuTiP is; the \(\chi\)-matrix representation,. \[\Lambda(\rho) = \sum_{\alpha,\beta} \chi_{\alpha,\beta} B_{\alpha} \rho B_{\beta}^\dagger,\]; where \(\{B_\alpha\}\) is a basis for the space of matrices acting; on \(\mathcal{H}\). In QuTiP, this basis is taken to be the Pauli; basis \(B_\alpha = \sigma_\alpha / \sqrt{2}\). Conversion to the; \(\chi\) formalism is handled by the to_chi; function.; chi = to_chi(S); print(chi). Output:; Quantum object: dims = [[[2], [2]], [[2], [2]]], shape = (4, 4), type = super, isherm = True, superrep = chi; Qobj data =; [[3.7+0.j 0. +0.j 0. +0.j 0.1+0.j ]; [0. +0.j 0.1+0.j 0. +0.1j 0. +0.j ]; [0. +0.j 0. -0.1j 0.1+0.j 0. +0.j ]; [0.1+0.j 0. +0.j 0. +0.j 0.1+0.j ]].

Output:; (0.925+0j). Here, the factor of 4 comes from the dimension of the underlying; Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\). As with the superoperator; and Choi representations, the \(\chi\) representation is; denoted by the superrep, such that to_super,; to_choi, to_kraus,; to_stinespring and to_chi; all convert from the \(\chi\) representation appropriately. Properties of Quantum Maps¶; In addition to converting between the different representations of quantum maps,; QuTiP also provides attributes to make it easy to check if a map is completely; positive, trace preserving and/or hermicity preserving. Each of these attributes; uses superrep to automatically perform any needed conversions.; In particular, a quantum map is said to be positive (but not necessarily completely; positive) if it maps all positive operators to positive operators.

Change Log¶. Version 4.6.3 (February ?, 2022)¶; This minor release adds support for numpy 1.22 and Python 3.10 and removes some blockers for running QuTiP on the Apple M1.; The performance of the enr_destroy, state_number_enumerate and hadamard_transform functions was drastically improved (up to 70x or 200x faster in some common cases), and support for the drift Hamiltonian was added to the qutip.qip Processor.; The qutip.hardware_info module was removed as part of adding support for the Apple M1. We hope the removal of this little-used module does not adversely affect many users – it was largely unrelated to QuTiP’s core functionality and its presence was a continual source of blockers to importing qutip on new or changed platforms.; A new check on the dimensions of Qobj’s were added to prevent segmentation faults when invalid shape and dimension combinations were passed to Cython code.; In addition, there were many small bugfixes, documentation improvements, and improvements to our buildin",MatchSource.WIKI,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org/docs/4.6/changelog.html:1975,Log,Log,1975,docs/4.6/changelog.html,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.6/changelog.html,1,['Log'],['Log']

Dynamics Simulation Results¶. Important; In QuTiP 2, the results from all of the dynamics solvers are returned as Odedata objects. This unified and significantly simplified postprocessing of simulation results from different solvers, compared to QuTiP 1. However, this change also results in the loss of backward compatibility with QuTiP version 1.x. In QuTiP 3, the Odedata class has been renamed to Result, but for backwards compatibility an alias between Result and Odedata is provided.

Parallel map and parallel for-loop¶; Often one is interested in the output of a given function as a single-parameter is varied. For instance, we can calculate the steady-state response of our system as the driving frequency is varied. In cases such as this, where each iteration is independent of the others, we can speedup the calculation by performing the iterations in parallel. In QuTiP, parallel computations may be performed using the qutip.parallel.parallel_map function or the qutip.parallel.parfor (parallel-for-loop) function.; To use the these functions we need to define a function of one or more variables, and the range over which one of these variables are to be evaluated.

Important; Updated in QuTiP version 3.0. Introduction¶; When studying the dynamics of a two-level system, it is often convent to visualize the state of the system by plotting the state-vector or density matrix on the Bloch sphere. In QuTiP, we have created two different classes to allow for easy creation and manipulation of data sets, both vectors and data points, on the Bloch sphere. The qutip.Bloch class, uses Matplotlib to render the Bloch sphere, where as qutip.Bloch3d uses the Mayavi rendering engine to generate a more faithful 3D reconstruction of the Bloch sphere.

Quantum Information Processing¶. Introduction¶; The Quantum Information Processing (QIP) module aims at providing basic tools for quantum computing simulation both for simple quantum algorithm design and for experimental realization. It offers two different approaches, one with qutip.qip.QubitCircuit calculating unitary evolution under quantum gates by matrix product, another called qutip.qip.device.Processor using open system solver in QuTiP to simulate noisy quantum device. Quantum Circuit¶; The most common model for quantum computing is the quantum circuit model. In QuTiP, we use qutip.qip.QubitCircuit to represent a quantum circuit. Each quantum gate is saved as a class object qutip.qip.operations.Gate with information such as gate name, target qubits and arguments. To get the matrix representation of each gate, we can call the class method qutip.qip.QubitCircuit.propagators. Carrying out the matrices product, one gets the matrix representation of the whole evolution.

Important; Updated in QuTiP 3.2. Introduction¶; For time-independent open quantum systems with decay rates larger than the corresponding excitation rates, the system will tend toward a steady state as \(t\rightarrow\infty\) that satisfies the equation. \[\frac{d\hat{\rho}_{ss}}{dt}=\mathcal{L}\hat{\rho}_{ss}=0.\]; Although the requirement for time-independence seems quite resitrictive, one can often employ a transformation to the interaction picture that yields a time-independent Hamiltonian. For many these systems, solving for the asymptotic density matrix \(\hat{\rho}_{ss}\) can be achieved using direct or iterative solution methods faster than using master equation or Monte Carlo simulations. Although the steady state equation has a simple mathematical form, the properties of the Liouvillian operator are such that the solutions to this equation are anything but straightforward to find. Steady State solvers in QuTiP¶; In QuTiP, the steady-state solution for a system Hamiltonian",MatchSource.WIKI,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org/docs/4.0.2/guide/guide-steady.html:846,Log,Log,846,docs/4.0.2/guide/guide-steady.html,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.0.2/guide/guide-steady.html,1,['Log'],['Log']

Two-time correlation functions¶; With the QuTiP time-evolution functions (for example qutip.mesolve and qutip.mcsolve), a state vector or density matrix can be evolved from an initial state at \(t_0\) to an arbitrary time \(t\), \(\rho(t)=V(t, t_0)\left\{\rho(t_0)\right\}\), where \(V(t, t_0)\) is the propagator defined by the equation of motion. The resulting density matrix can then be used to evaluate the expectation values of arbitrary combinations of same-time operators.; To calculate two-time correlation functions on the form \(\left<A(t+\tau)B(t)\right>\), we can use the quantum regression theorem (see, e.g., [Gar03]) to write. \[\left<A(t+\tau)B(t)\right> = {\rm Tr}\left[A V(t+\tau, t)\left\{B\rho(t)\right\}\right]; = {\rm Tr}\left[A V(t+\tau, t)\left\{BV(t, 0)\left\{\rho(0)\right\}\right\}\right]\]; We therefore first calculate \(\rho(t)=V(t, 0)\left\{\rho(0)\right\}\) using one of the QuTiP evolution solvers with \(\rho(0)\) as initial state, and then again use the same solve",MatchSource.WIKI,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org/docs/4.0.2/guide/guide-correlation.html:882,Log,Log,882,docs/4.0.2/guide/guide-correlation.html,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.0.2/guide/guide-correlation.html,1,['Log'],['Log']

Quick Start¶; QuTiP is developed through wide collaboration using the git version-control system, with the main repositories hosted in the qutip organisation on GitHub.; You will need to be familiar with git as a tool, and the GitHub Flow workflow for branching and making pull requests.; The exact details of environment set-up, build process and testing vary by repository and are discussed below, however in overview, the steps to contribute are:.

Stochastic Solver¶; When a quantum system is subjected to continuous measurement, through homodyne detection for example, it is possible to simulate the conditional quantum state using stochastic Schrodinger and master equations. The solution of these stochastic equations are quantum trajectories, which represent the conditioned evolution of the system given a specific measurement record.; In general, the stochastic evolution of a quantum state is calculated in; QuTiP by solving the general equation. (1)¶\[d \rho (t) = d_1 \rho dt + \sum_n d_{2,n} \rho dW_n,\]; where \(dW_n\) is a Wiener increment, which has the expectation values \(E[dW] = 0\) and \(E[dW^2] = dt\). Stochastic evolution is implemented with the qutip.stochastic.general_stochastic function.

Unitary evolution¶; The dynamics of a closed (pure) quantum system is governed by the Schrödinger equation. (1)¶\[ i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi = \hat H \Psi,\]; where \(\Psi\) is the wave function, \(\hat H\) the Hamiltonian, and \(\hbar\) is Planck’s constant. In general, the Schrödinger equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) where both \(\Psi\) and \(\hat H\) are functions of space and time. For computational purposes it is useful to expand the PDE in a set of basis functions that span the Hilbert space of the Hamiltonian, and to write the equation in matrix and vector form. \[i\hbar\frac{d}{dt}\left|\psi\right> = H \left|\psi\right>\]; where \(\left|\psi\right>\) is the state vector and \(H\) is the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian.

Plotting on the Bloch Sphere¶. Introduction¶; When studying the dynamics of a two-level system, it is often convenient to visualize the state of the system by plotting the state-vector or density matrix on the Bloch sphere. In QuTiP, we have created two different classes to allow for easy creation and manipulation of data sets, both vectors and data points, on the Bloch sphere. The qutip.bloch.Bloch class, uses Matplotlib to render the Bloch sphere, where as qutip.bloch3d.Bloch3d uses the Mayavi rendering engine to generate a more faithful 3D reconstruction of the Bloch sphere. The Bloch and Bloch3d Classes¶; In QuTiP, creating a Bloch sphere is accomplished by calling either:; b = qutip.Bloch(). which will load an instance of the qutip.bloch.Bloch class, or using; >>> b3d = qutip.Bloch3d(). that loads the qutip.bloch3d.Bloch3d version.

BoFiN-HEOM¶; BoFiN-HEOM (the bosonic and fermionic HEOM solver) was a much more; flexible re-write of the original QuTiP HSolverDL that added support for; both bosonic and fermionic baths and for baths to be specified directly via; their correlation function expansion coefficients.

Introduction¶; In quantum control we look to prepare some specific state, effect some state-to-state transfer, or effect some transformation (or gate) on a quantum system. For a given quantum system there will always be factors that effect the dynamics that are outside of our control.

Quantum Optimal Control¶. Introduction¶; In quantum control we look to prepare some specific state, effect some state-to-state transfer, or effect some transformation (or gate) on a quantum system. For a given quantum system there will always be factors that effect the dynamics that are outside of our control. As examples, the interactions between elements of the system or a magnetic field required to trap the system. However, there may be methods of affecting the dynamics in a controlled way, such as the time varying amplitude of the electric component of an interacting laser field.

Saving QuTiP Objects and Data Sets¶; With time-consuming calculations it is often necessary to store the results to files on disk, so it can be post-processed and archived. In QuTiP there are two facilities for storing data: Quantum objects can be stored to files and later read back as python pickles, and numerical data (vectors and matrices) can be exported as plain text files in for example CSV (comma-separated values), TSV (tab-separated values), etc. The former method is preferred when further calculations will be performed with the data, and the latter when the calculations are completed and data is to be imported into a post-processing tool (e.g. for generating figures). Storing and loading QuTiP objects¶; To store and load arbitrary QuTiP related objects (qutip.Qobj, qutip.solver.Result, etc.) there are two functions: qutip.fileio.qsave and qutip.fileio.qload. The function qutip.fileio.qsave takes an arbitrary object as first parameter and an optional filename as second parame",MatchSource.WIKI,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org/docs/4.7/guide/guide-saving.html:832,Log,Log,832,docs/4.7/guide/guide-saving.html,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.7/guide/guide-saving.html,1,['Log'],['Log']

Introduction¶; For time-independent open quantum systems with decay rates larger than the corresponding excitation rates, the system will tend toward a steady state as \(t\rightarrow\infty\) that satisfies the equation. \[\frac{d\hat{\rho}_{ss}}{dt}=\mathcal{L}\hat{\rho}_{ss}=0.\]; Although the requirement for time-independence seems quite resitrictive, one can often employ a transformation to the interaction picture that yields a time-independent Hamiltonian. For many these systems, solving for the asymptotic density matrix \(\hat{\rho}_{ss}\) can be achieved using direct or iterative solution methods faster than using master equation or Monte Carlo simulations. Although the steady state equation has a simple mathematical form, the properties of the Liouvillian operator are such that the solutions to this equation are anything but straightforward to find.

Two-time correlation functions¶; With the QuTiP time-evolution functions (for example qutip.mesolve and qutip.mcsolve), a state vector or density matrix can be evolved from an initial state at \(t_0\) to an arbitrary time \(t\), \(\rho(t)=V(t, t_0)\left\{\rho(t_0)\right\}\), where \(V(t, t_0)\) is the propagator defined by the equation of motion. The resulting density matrix can then be used to evaluate the expectation values of arbitrary combinations of same-time operators.; To calculate two-time correlation functions on the form \(\left<A(t+\tau)B(t)\right>\), we can use the quantum regression theorem (see, e.g., [Gar03]) to write. \[\left<A(t+\tau)B(t)\right> = {\rm Tr}\left[A V(t+\tau, t)\left\{B\rho(t)\right\}\right]; = {\rm Tr}\left[A V(t+\tau, t)\left\{BV(t, 0)\left\{\rho(0)\right\}\right\}\right]\]; We therefore first calculate \(\rho(t)=V(t, 0)\left\{\rho(0)\r",MatchSource.WIKI,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org/docs/4.7/guide/guide-correlation.html:953,Log,Log,953,docs/4.7/guide/guide-correlation.html,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.7/guide/guide-correlation.html,1,['Log'],['Log']

Using Tensor Products and Partial Traces¶. Tensor products¶; To describe the states of multipartite quantum systems - such as two coupled qubits, a qubit coupled to an oscillator, etc. - we need to expand the Hilbert space by taking the tensor product of the state vectors for each of the system components. Similarly, the operators acting on the state vectors in the combined Hilbert space (describing the coupled system) are formed by taking the tensor product of the individual operators.; In QuTiP the function qutip.tensor.tensor is used to accomplish this task. This function takes as argument a collection:; >>> tensor(op1, op2, op3) . or a list:; >>> tensor([op1, op2, op3]) . of state vectors or operators and returns a composite quantum object for the combined Hilbert space. The function accepts an arbitray number of states or operators as argument. The type returned qu",MatchSource.WIKI,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org/docs/4.6/guide/guide-tensor.html:967,Log,Log,967,docs/4.6/guide/guide-tensor.html,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.6/guide/guide-tensor.html,1,['Log'],['Log']

Working with the QuTiP Documentation¶; The user guide provides an overview of QuTiP’s functionality.; The guide is composed of individual reStructuredText (.rst) files which each get rendered as a webpage.; Each page typically tackles one area of functionality.; To learn more about how to write .rst files, it is useful to follow the sphinx guide.; The documentation build also utilizes a number of; Sphinx Extensions; including but not limited to; doctest,; autodoc,; sphinx gallery and; plot.; Additional extensions can be configured in the conf.py file. Directives¶; There are two Sphinx directives that can be used to write code examples in the user guide:. Doctest; Plot. For a more comprehensive account of the usage of each directive, please refer to their individual pages. Here we outline some general guidelines on how to these directives while making a user guide. Doctest¶; The doctest directive enables tests on interactive code examples.; The simplest way to do this is by specifying a prompt along with its respective output:; .. doctest::. >>> a = 2; >>> a; 2. This is rendered in the documentation as follows:; >>> a = 2; >>> a; 2. While specifying code examples under the .. doctest:: directive, either all statements must be specified by the >>> prompt or without it.; For every prompt, any potential corresponding output must be specified immediately after it.; This directive is ideally used when there are a number",MatchSource.WIKI,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org/docs/4.7/development/docs.html:188,Log,Log,188,docs/4.7/development/docs.html,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.7/development/docs.html,1,['Log'],['Log']

Included are the trace distance qutip.metrics.tracedist, fidelity qutip.metrics.fidelity, Hilbert-Schmidt distance qutip.metrics.hilbert_dist, Bures distance qutip.metrics.bures_dist, Bures angle qutip.metrics.bures_angle, and quantum Hellinger distance qutip.metrics.hellinger_dist.; x = coherent_dm(5, 1.25). y = coherent_dm(5, np.complex(0, 1.25)) # <-- note the 'j'. z = thermal_dm(5, 0.125). np.testing.assert_almost_equal(fidelity(x, x), 1). np.testing.assert_almost_equal(hellinger_dist(x, y), 1.3819080728932833). We also know that for two pure states, the trace distance (T) and the fidelity (F) are related by \(T = \sqrt{1 - F^{2}}\), while the quantum Hellinger distance (QHE) between two pure states \(\left|\psi\right>\) and \(\left|\phi\right>\) is given by \(QHE = \sqrt{2 - 2\left|\left<\psi | \phi\right>\right|^2}\).; np.testing.assert_almost_equal(tracedist(y, x), np.sqrt(1 - fidelity(y, x) ** 2)).

Qubit (two-level) systems¶; Having spent a fair amount of time on basis states that represent harmonic oscillator states, we now move on to qubit, or two-level quantum systems (for example a spin-1/2). To create a state vector corresponding to a qubit system, we use the same qutip.states.basis, or qutip.states.fock, function with only two levels:; spin = basis(2, 0). Now at this point one may ask how this state is different than that of a harmonic oscillator in the vacuum state truncated to two energy levels?; vac = basis(2, 0). At this stage, there is no difference. This should not be surprising as we called the exact same function twice. The difference between the two comes from the action of the spin operators qutip.operators.sigmax, qutip.operators.sigmay, qutip.operators.si",MatchSource.WIKI,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org/docs/4.6/guide/guide-states.html:10765,test,testing,10765,docs/4.6/guide/guide-states.html,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.6/guide/guide-states.html,2,['test'],['testing']

""""""; Classes here are expected to implement a run_optimization function; that will use some method for optimising the control pulse, as defined; by the control amplitudes. The system that the pulse acts upon are defined; by the Dynamics object that must be passed in the instantiation. The methods are typically N dimensional function optimisers that; find the minima of a fidelity error function. Note the number of variables; for the fidelity function is the number of control timeslots,; i.e. n_ctrls x Ntimeslots; The methods will call functions on the Dynamics.fid_computer object,; one or many times per interation,; to get the fidelity error and gradient wrt to the amplitudes.; The optimisation will stop when one of the termination conditions are met,; for example: the fidelity aim has be reached, a local minima has been found,; the maximum time allowed has been exceeded. These function optimisation methods are so far from SciPy.optimize; The two methods implemented are:. BFGS - Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm. This a quasi second order Newton method. It uses successive calls to; the gradient function to make an estimation of the curvature (Hessian); and hence direct its search for the function minima; The SciPy implementation is pure Python and hance is execution speed is; not high; use subclass: OptimizerBFGS.

""""""; Timeslot Computer; These classes determine which dynamics generators, propagators and evolutions; are recalculated when there is a control amplitude update.; The timeslot computer processes the lists held by the dynamics object. The default (UpdateAll) updates all of these each amp update, on the; assumption that all amplitudes are changed each iteration. This is typical; when using optimisation methods like BFGS in the GRAPE algorithm. The alternative (DynUpdate) assumes that only a subset of amplitudes; are updated each iteration and attempts to minimise the number of expensive; calculations accordingly. This would be the appropriate class for Krotov type; methods. Note that the Stats_DynTsUpdate class must be used for stats; in conjunction with this class.; NOTE: AJGP 2011-10-2014: This _DynUpdate class currently has some bug,; no pressing need to fix it presently. If all amplitudes change at each update, then the behavior of the classes is; equivalent. _UpdateAll is easier to understand and potentially slightly faster; in this situation.

If you need to create a Python 2.7 conda environment see building-conda-environment, including adding-conda-forge; Then run:; conda install mingwpy. To specify the use of the mingw compiler you will need to create the following file:; <path to my Python env>/Lib/distutils/distutils.cfg. with the following contents:; [build]; compiler=mingw32; [build_ext]; compiler=mingw32. <path to my Python env> will be something like C:\Ananconda2\ or C:\Ananconda2\envs\qutip-env\ depending on where you installed Anaconda or Miniconda, and whether you created a specific environment.; You can then install QuTiP using either the install-via_pip or install-get-it method. Verifying the Installation¶; QuTiP includes a collection of built-in test scripts to verify that an installation was successful. To run the suite of tests scripts you must have the pytest testing library. After installing QuTiP, leave the installation directory, run Python (or iPython), and call:; import qutip.testing as qt; qt.run(). If successful, these tests indicate that all of the QuTiP functions are working properly. If any errors occur, please check that you have installed all of the required modules. See the next section on how to check the installed versions of the QuTiP dependencies. If these tests still fail, then head on over to the QuTiP Discussion Board and post a message detailing your particular issue. Checking Version Information using the About Function¶; QuTiP includes an “about” function for viewing information about QuTiP and the important dependencies installed on your system.

Optimized BLAS Libraries¶; QuTiP is designed to take advantage of some of the optimized BLAS libraries that are available for NumPy. At present, this includes the OPENBLAS and MKL libraries. If NumPy is built against these libraries, then QuTiP will take advantage of the performance gained by using these optimized tools. As these libraries are multi-threaded, you can change the number of threads used in these packages by adding:; >>> import os; >>> os.environ['OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS'] = '4'; >>> os.environ['MKL_NUM_THREADS'] = '4'. at the top of your Python script files, or iPython notebooks, and then loading the QuTiP framework. If these commands are not present, then QuTiP automatically sets the number of threads to one. Verifying the Installation¶; QuTiP includes a collection of built-in test scripts to verify that an installation was successful. To run the suite of tests scripts you must have the nose testing library. After installing QuTiP, leave the installation directory, run Python (or iPython), and call:; >>> import qutip.testing as qt; >>> qt.run().

(png, hires.png, pdf). A few notes on using the plot directive:. A useful argument to specify in plot blocks is that of context which ensures; that the code is being run in the namespace of the previous plot block within the; same file.; By default, each rendered figure in one plot block (when using :context:); is carried over to the next block.; When the context argument is specified with the reset option; as :context: reset, the namespace is reset to a new one and all figures are; erased.; When the context argument is specified with the close-figs option; as :context: reset, the namespace is reset to a new one and all figures are; erased. The Plot directive cannot be used in conjunction with Doctest because they do not; share the same namespace when used in the same file.; Since Plot can also be used in doctest mode, in; the case where code examples require both testing and rendering figures, it is; easier to use the Plot directive. To learn more about each directive, it is useful; to refer to their individual pages. Next ; Previous. © Copyright 2011 and later, P.D. Nation, J.R. Johansson, A.J.G. Pitchford, C. Granade, A.L.

Therefore, the qutip.expect function will return an array of complex values for non-Hermitian operators when the input is a list/array of states or density matrices.; Of course, the qutip.expect function works for spin states and operators:; up = basis(2, 0). down = basis(2, 1). np.testing.assert_almost_equal(expect(sigmaz(), up), 1). np.testing.assert_almost_equal(expect(sigmaz(), down), -1). as well as the composite objects discussed in the next section Using Tensor Products and Partial Traces:; spin1 = basis(2, 0). spin2 = basis(2, 1). two_spins = tensor(spin1, spin2). sz1 = tensor(sigmaz(), qeye(2)). sz2 = tensor(qeye(2), sigmaz()). np.testing.assert_almost_equal(expect(sz1, two_spins), 1). np.testing.assert_almost_equal(expect(sz2, two_spins), -1). Superoperators and Vectorized Operators¶; In addition to state vectors and density operators, QuTiP allows for; representing maps that act linearly on density operators using the Kraus,; Liouville supermatrix and Choi matrix formalisms. This support is based on the; correspondence between linear operators acting on a Hilbert space, and vectors; in two copies of that Hilbert space,; \(\mathrm{vec} : \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H}) \to \mathcal{H} \otimes \mathcal{H}\); [Hav03], [Wat13].; This isomorphism is implemented in QuT",MatchSource.WIKI,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org/docs/4.7/guide/guide-states.html:16535,test,testing,16535,docs/4.7/guide/guide-states.html,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.7/guide/guide-states.html,1,['test'],['testing']

Bloch-Redfield master equation¶. Introduction¶; The Lindblad master equation introduced earlier is constructed so that it describes a physical evolution of the density matrix (i.e., trace and positivity preserving), but it does not provide a connection to any underlaying microscopic physical model. The Lindblad operators (collapse operators) describe phenomenological processes, such as for example dephasing and spin flips, and the rates of these processes are arbitrary parameters in the model. In many situations the collapse operators and their corresponding rates have clear physical interpretation, such as dephasing and relaxation rates, and in those cases the Lindblad master equation is usually the method of choice.; However, in some cases, for example systems with varying energy biases and eigenstates and that couple to a",MatchSource.WIKI,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html:1142,Log,Log,1142,docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/4.4/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html,1,['Log'],['Log']

Generating Random Quantum States & Operators¶; QuTiP includes a collection of random state generators for simulations, theorem evaluation, and code testing:. Function; Description. rand_ket; Random ket-vector. rand_dm; Random density matrix. rand_herm; Random Hermitian matrix. rand_unitary; Random Unitary matrix. See the API documentation: Random Operators and States for details.; In all cases, these functions can be called with a single parameter \(N\) that indicates a \(NxN\) matrix (rand_dm, rand_herm, rand_unitary), or a \(Nx1\) vector (rand_ket), should be generated. For example:; In [2]: rand_ket(5); Out[2]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [1]], shape = [5, 1], type = ket; Qobj data =; [[-0.39285336+0.27024047j]; [-0.51803588+0.10328369j]; [-0.58850701-0.16960316j]; [-0.20872011+0.08251858j]; [-0.23355115+0.11654335j]]. or; In [3]: rand_herm(5); Out[3]: ; Quantum object: dims = [[5], [5]], shape = [5, 5], type = oper, isherm = True; Qobj data =; [[-0.78906375+0.j -0.49042711+0.01532022j -0.20366873+0.17308185j; -0.33542127-0.1744431j 0.00000000+0.j ]; [-0.4",MatchSource.WIKI,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-random.html:1774,test,testing,1774,docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-random.html,https://qutip.org,https://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/guide/guide-random.html,1,['test'],['testing']
