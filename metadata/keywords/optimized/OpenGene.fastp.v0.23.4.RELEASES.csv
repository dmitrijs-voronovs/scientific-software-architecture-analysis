Performance,"The threading and I/O modules have been completely rewritten to generate reproducible outputs and improve performance greatly. New libraries `libisal` and `libdeflate` were introduced to replace the slow `zlib`. Although this may bring some difficulties to compilation, it is all worthwhile for performance improvement. In many cases, fastp v0.23.0 can be 2x as faster as previous versions. Especially, when the compression level is set to 6 or higher, the performance gain is very obvious. Threading randomness issue has been addressed, so the output files are MD5 consistent when you run it twice, which means the results are completely reproducible.",MatchSource.RELEASES,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/releases/tag/v0.23.0:106,perform,performance,106,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/releases/tag/v0.23.0,3,['perform'],['performance']

Safety,"For Illumina NextSeq/NovaSeq data, polyG can happen in read tails since G means no signal in the Illumina two-color systems. fastp can detect the polyG in read tails and trim them. This feature is enabled for NextSeq/NovaSeq data by default, and you can specify -g or --trim_poly_g to enable it for any data, or specify -G or --disable_trim_poly_g to disable it. NextSeq/NovaSeq data is detected by the machine ID in the FASTQ records.",MatchSource.RELEASES,OpenGene,fastp,v0.23.4,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/releases/tag/v0.10.0:135,detect,detect,135,,https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/releases/tag/v0.10.0,2,['detect'],"['detect', 'detected']"
