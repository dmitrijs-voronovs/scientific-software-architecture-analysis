Testability,"My thoughts on the questions:; > How much validation do we want?. I would think that input would need to be validated always as the source is unknown, and output should be validated as part of the test suite, but then does not need to be validated at run-time before they are returned since (ideally) the test-suite ensures that our output jsons always adhere to the schema. Is there a best practice followed by applications using JSON APIs? For example does the JSON ""consumer"" always hold responsibility for checking that the object received is valid, or is it up to the JSON ""producer"" to ensure that objects are valid before sending them? . >A full test suite should like come from the schema itself?. Not sure what you mean here. Should the schema project provide functionality to validate objects that can be used by applications adhering to the schema to test that their JSON generating functions are generating valid objects? That would be great, and would reduce the amount of work that needs to be done by devs of individual QC packages to adopt the interface. > How we will we handle extra psi vars?

Testability,"Not quite. The testing is just a guide that helps us to determine whether to accept a PR or not; the outcome of the tests does not affect GitHub's handling of the merge at all. So in your example above, all 5 commits would be pulled in. I was trying to make the following point, but didn't explain well at all:. Say you open a pull request with three commits, but discover that the tests don't pass. If you were to continue pushing commits to your GitHub repo branch (the same one you based the PR on), those commits would continue to be added real-time to the original PR automatically. Therefore there's no need to close the PR when you find that it's broken, and re-open a new one when it's fixed. In fact I think it's better to just leave the original one open, because it allows a discussion to take place, amongst the commits, and the team can hopefully jump in with solutions to whatever problems were created. It's up to you, or whomever actually accepts the PR, to make sure that the final commit in the PR passes the tests before accepting it. The Travis CI testing helps us to quickly make that determination, and GitHub helpfully tells us whether the merge can happen without conflicts.

Testability,"Ok, I have a [fix](https://github.com/raimis/psi4/pull/4) that works. The problem is that a new(ish) constructor was added [here](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/psi4/src/psi4/libtrans/integraltransform.cc#L112-L193), which expects the frozen occ, active occ, active vir, and frozen vir orbitals to be passed in that order. The DETCI code passes spaces (constructed [here](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/psi4/src/psi4/detci/ints.cc#L84-L87)) that are not consistent with this; the second space holds all the active orbitals in the `cisd-h2o+-0` test, while the third is empty:; ```; Irrep: 0 Space1: 1 Space2: 11 Space3: 0 Space4: 0; Irrep: 1 Space1: 0 Space2: 2 Space3: 0 Space4: 0; Irrep: 2 Space1: 0 Space2: 4 Space3: 0 Space4: 0; Irrep: 3 Space1: 0 Space2: 7 Space3: 0 Space4: 0; ```; The number of occupied per irrep is computed from the dimensions of these things, leading to an incorrect distribution of electrons. I tried to pass in different spaces from [here](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/psi4/src/psi4/detci/ciwave.cc#L171-L257) but couldn't find a set of spaces that didn't break at least one DETCI test. The occupation info is used to build the density matrix (from which the Fock matrix is built) during presorting of the integrals, which is where the seg fault happens. This Fock build is really vestigial code that was only ever there to make sure libtrans did the same thing as the Psi3 code it replaced at the time, so I decided to simply make the Fock build optional. It's clear that DETCI doesn't use the Fock matrix from Libtrans because it gets the right answer despite having bad occupation info. The frozen core density is correct; this seems to be all that DETCI uses, so I think this fix is good.

There's a new test case, extern1, that confirms the correctness of the gradients by finite differences. The PBE results don't seem to match the Gaussian results that you posted; I don't have access to Gaussian so I can't investigate that any further, I'm afraid. A good place to start would be an SCF calculation, because DFT grids are not uniform between packages. It's also a good idea to manually specify the basis set (Psi4 uses the G94 standard) to ensure that both packages are using the exact same functions. With these changes, the energies and gradients should match exactly; if not it's probably confusion between A/Bohr in the Gaussian input for the TIP3P fragment. Until these fixes, Psi4 assumed that the external potential was always in Bohr, but now the code will assume the same units as those used to specify the QM molecule. Good luck!.

If we end up adding a new JK object that uses symmetry, the above steps will be worth it. Just to get `OUT_OF_CORE` working, not so much unless anybody already knows why it doesn't work and can easily fix it.

Testability,"On the `clean` issue, I don't see a change in behavior from your PR. The below (on master) also requires the intervening `clean()` to avoid a PSIO error.

Testability,"On the test suite error, it's a good idea to turn convergences way down (e.g., 10 or 12) to compute the reference values, then remove conv settings for the final test case and do the compare_values check to the number or fewer decimals than the default for the calc type (energy, gradient, etc.).

Testability,"Oops, I missed your comment. The old `addBasis` still works the same way, and the normalization associated with it is appropriate for external basis functions derived from density fitting. In QM/MM we normally want some Gaussians at different points in space, and in this case we want unit normalization so that the charges, dipoles, etc. specified don't need to be adjusted. Essentially there are two use cases, and I just added a new one here. Not really a bug fix, but also harmless if we want it in 1.4 - entirely up to you.

The DYNAMIC_ARCH is optional, it enables runtime CPU arch detection. ; This could rule out both bugs in older versions of OpenBLAS and the chance that the Intel compilers are messing up OpenBLAS.; IIRC OpenBLAS is rarely used/tested with Intel compilers, since most people who have Intel compilers end up using MKL instead.

Given AppVeyor's tendency to timeout, I opted to just exclude that test, rather than compile with higher angular momentum and make the timeout problem worse.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/933#issuecomment-433666463:41,test,test,41,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/933#issuecomment-433666463,3,['test'],['test']
Testability,"PR #922 should address the `DSD-xxx`-class of functionals. I have also modified the `dashparams.py` in that PR, however I plan to expand the dashparams even further (to include references as well and to automatically generate the functionals listed). . It would be really good to get these tests merged.

Testability,"PRs psi-rking/optking#24 and psi4/psi4#1335 are a pair. Together, they get most optimizations working for Psi. In particular have working:. - [x] ordinary, opt-is-full job optimizations; - [x] collecting all the psivars so psi can read them in. basically, collecting enough to generate a skeleton (mol, basis, psivars) that can be passed back from `psi4.optimize(..., return_wfn=True)`; - [x] inlining optking's logging output into the psi4 output file; - [x] resetting psi4's options on either side of the `optking.run_json_dict()` call. The trouble was that the psi4-s imported by optking were clearing and setting options (as is proper for indep json runs) such that the calling psi4 didn't have its original options in globals upon optking termination; - [x] starting to catch optking errors (str in json) and re-raising them as psi4 errors. Yes, that AlgError vs OptError for exceeding geom_maxiter really stumped me for a while b/c I only got the final error (""dynamic level exceeded"") and I thought it was behaving differently btwn direct optking and psi4 initiated runs. To me it seems clear that if geom_maxiter is exceeded, then optimizer quits directly (though perhaps that's clearer when geom_maxiter=2 than =200). @psi-rking @AlexHeide",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/1335#issuecomment-436437450:412,log,logging,412,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/1335#issuecomment-436437450,1,['log'],['logging']

But for now, OpenBLAS is going to go the way of Accelerate (on Mac) and just get a nice Use At Your Own Risk warning.

There might be a further technical choice why the conda openblas package isn't building the Fortran/LAPACK code with optimizations (https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1009#issuecomment-387075271), but an immediate technical reason is that conda gfortran 7.2.0 isn't distributing `omp_lib.[h|mod]`, so threading isn't avail.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1009#issuecomment-391015669:70,test,testing,70,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1009#issuecomment-391015669,1,['test'],['testing']

Testability,"So I cross-checked this with the CompositeJK methods, and; as I somewhat suspected might happen, the CompositeJK methods do not work with `screening none`. `SCF_TYPE DFDIRJ+LINK` segfaults, while `SCF_TYPE DFDIRJ+COSX` gives the wrong answer, from my testing. . The composite methods partially implement the screening machinery within themselves instead of relying entirely on the `TwoBodyAOInt::shell_significant()` function for sieving. Some `TwoBodyAOInt` member functions, such as `TwoBodyAOInt::shell_pair_values` (used in DF-DirJ), and `TwoBodyAOInt::shell_pair_significant` (used in LinK) are used to assist with this. However, these functions rely on values that (specifically, `shell_pair_values_`, `screening_threshold_squared_`, and `max_integral_`) are initialized during the call to `TwoBodyAOInt::create_sieve_pair_info`, which is never called when `screening_type` is set to `none` due to the `return` upon registering `ScreeningType::None` for the sieve during `TwoBodyAOInt::setup_sieve`. That's where I suspect these problems are coming from.

Testability,"So I was thinking about getting rid of `""component""` too. The difference between something like ""MP2"" and ""B2PLYP"" is that while there's a name for the SCF component of MP2 (it's HF), there's no such thing for the SCF part of B2PLYP. Also, before components were introduced, the keys in the `VARH` dict had to be valid methods, having a check against component gets around this issue. I think a much cleaner interface may be to rework how the extrapolation functions (`corl_xtpl_helgaker_2` etc.) work. Rather than passing in an energy/gradient/Hessian, we could pass in the `wfn` + the variable to extrapolate, and instead of trying to shoehorn the dft extrapolation into the existing interface, it could be neatly contained in a single extrapolation function. The only issue I see with this is that the printing of the CBS stages would have to move from `cbs()` into the extrapolation function itself. This is perhaps better discussed once DDD is in?. ------. I have made changes to the duplication detection, merging the two loops. Instead of a simple counter, it's now an array of job-indices, with the first element being the highest priority (ie the one with the matching wfn). Also, @hokru your ""requested"" syntax now works, see the added test which combines components arbitrarily. `ctest -L cbs` passes.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/2132#issuecomment-973871657:1246,test,test,1246,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/2132#issuecomment-973871657,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"So I've added the option to be able to run frequency calculations via the cbs interface, both using the `""method/basis""` and `frequency(cbs, ...)` syntax.

Testability,"So after some digging, it seems that different CI runs on different hardware/compilers provide *slightly* different density/exchange matrix elements. I can only presume this is because `-march=native` is generally used in Psi4 builds. Since I set the `test_gauxc_writer.py` test tolerances to be pretty tight (literally no difference between the reference and actual density matrix), this slight deviation led the tests to fail.

Testability,"Sorry for taking such a long time on this. @loriab the `input.dat` in `pcmsolver/scf` now shows how to recover files from scratch:; ```python; pid = str(os.getpid()); scratch_dir = os.path.join(core.IOManager.shared_object().get_default_path(), 'psi.' + pid + '.pcmsolver'); pcm_save = reduce(lambda l1, l2 : l1 + l2, (glob.glob(t) for t in [scratch_dir + '*/' + x for x in ['cavity.off__' + pid, 'PEDRA.OUT__' + pid, 'cavity.npz']])); filter(lambda x : shutil.copy(x, psi4.extras.get_input_directory()), pcm_save); ```; Maybe it's an interesting bit for `p4util/util.py`.; The `input.dat` for the `pcmsolver/dipole` test now uses the `perturb_h`, `perturb_with` and `perturb_dipole` parameters.

Testability,"Sorry for the confusion. What you're doing with PCMSolver is working just fine. What broke down was me not realizing that the `1.1.2` tag had what I needed, and I didn't need `HEAD`. Below is what I wrote to someone recently. External projects for psi4 can choose one of the below (or propose a new scheme), and PCMSolver is doing (2). If the below seems clear, I'll explicitly add it to the wiki. ## External Project Versioning (choose one); 1. Tag a release “0.2”, “v0.2”, or whatever. Let me know and I’ll (i) build the conda package and (ii) bump the `Add_ExternalProject` tag (for non-plugins). Repeat in a few months with “0.3”, etc. This way is handy if you want to settle on stable commits while possibly breaking the repo in interim commits. You may be asked to bump the tag after resolving psi4+externalproj interface or build issues. If you move the tag to a later commit, you'll have to let me know so I rebuild the conda package with the same version but a later build number. This is what CheMPS2 and PCMSolver do.; 2. Tag a release “0.2”, and I’ll (i) tell psinet to do nightly builds that increment micro on each git commit so versions will be ""tag.micro"" (e.g., 0.2.43) and (ii) remove git tag from `Add_ExternalProject` )for non-plugins). When you’re ready for 0.3, just make the new tag, no communication with me necessary. Strongly recommended not to mix light and annotated tags; the latter are always preferred; the former are what you get if you go through the github website tag-making interface. If the repo breaks such that “make” or any “make tests” you devise break, then no package will get uploaded, but otherwise the most recent will always be available. This is what Psi4 itself does.; 3. hybrid– do 2. but have the version that ships with the psi4 binary be pinned to a certain stable build unless user deliberately installs another.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/409#issuecomment-225993854:1570,test,tests,1570,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/409#issuecomment-225993854,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"Status update for those who are watching this: my original attempt at the four-index TPDM elements using pre-existing `libdpd` capabilities proved slower than the existing `libiwl` algorithm, so I've had to write new `libdpd` algorithms. The new algorithm working on just the `VVVV` block is beating the `libiwl` algorithm for speed. I'll need to modify the algorithm to handle more general blocks, make sure the speed is still good, and then I can commit the next step. The current plan is to replace the libiwl and presorting steps, but leave the rest of the TPDM logic as-is. This may change.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/1745#issuecomment-561305402:566,log,logic,566,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/1745#issuecomment-561305402,1,['log'],['logic']
Testability,"Status update on this, including developments from half an hour ago. Numerical tests indicate the difference in reaction energies between the current DF scheme and the new one are negligible. The Excel file is attached if anybody wants to look over the numbers themselves. @ssh2 and I are agreed that between that and some additional theoretical points, we'll just switch the density fitting scheme to fix Point 2. In the new scheme, the cumulant gets contracted against RIFIT integrals as before, and the _entire_ rest of the 2RDM gets contracted against JKFIT integrals. [df_dcft_comparison.xlsx](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/files/3023032/df_dcft_comparison.xlsx). Point 1 is trickier. I've spoken with @jturney about DF gradients in Psi. Although `deriv.cc` does a check to see if the wavefunction is density fitted in the gradient code, it isn't for density fitted gradients but to check whether necessary tensors exist on disk or as member variables. As far as I know, every DF gradient in Psi runs through its own module. DF-MP2 gradients have `dfmp2`, DF-SCF has `scfgrad`, and Bozkaya has `dfocc`. This will require some attention, but likely won't get it until after ACS Orlando.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1579#issuecomment-478019331:79,test,tests,79,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1579#issuecomment-478019331,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"Thank you for the additional BLAS distro tests and timing, @PeterKraus. I'm glad to see there are a couple more options. Continuing the Slack discussion, I agree Psi + threaded BLAS is something to keep an eye on. Points of concern:; * Matt used to see certain functionals failing the ionization test, presumably _with_ MKL (though I didn't explicitly check `ldd`). I couldn't reproduce this, so it might be a blip or it might be associated with various KMP_AFFINITY settings.; * @hokru, @PeterKraus, and I each had different OpenBLAS conclusions after trying several variations. In past Psi, there was a case of nested threading where MKL knew how to handle itself and others didn't. Perhaps there's a new case of that now (though why should single-thread fail?). I wouldn't be surprised if the final determination of guilt was Psi's, OpenBLAS's, or even both, but Psi is working with enough BLAS distros that I think it's reasonable to keep the situation under observation and collect any new sightings (esp. of flakiness in the presence of MKL).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1009#issuecomment-395090099:41,test,tests,41,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1009#issuecomment-395090099,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"Thank you very much for looking into this, @raimis - especially the detailed benchmarks. If my memories from way back (circa 2010) are correct, @robparrish and I were trying to write a prototype DF gradient code and hit a very strange error. The finite difference tests we did for hybrids all looked good, but for range-separated functionals we were getting quite large noise. The direct range-separated code worked fine, confirming that the derivative integrals were correct, and pointing the fact that we somehow messed up the chain rule in our haste. Since then Rob did a complete rewrite of the entire SCF machinery and made it infinitely better so, inspired by your detailed comments, I decided to revisit.

Testability,"Thanks @loriab for your detailed answer. In fact, I would like to do focal-point analyses for small molecules (including HF, MP2, CC, DBOC, and relativistic corrections) in a somewhat automated form. Psi4, which is able to execute MRCC and CFOUR, seems to me an optimal frame for this purpose (I saw that certain FPA schemes are already implemented in it). . The Psi4/Cfour route looks simpler for me. Basically I will use Cartesian coordinates, but in some cases it would be useful to do CCSD(T) optimizations via CFOUR (requiring internal coordinates). How to execute the solution you posted with Psi4?

I initially intended to swap the storage in `Vector` and `Matrix` to use xtensor, but that turned out to be quite hard (due to the extensive use of `pointer` basically everywhere in the code) The strategy now is to rewrite the storage object (I think that's largely done, though copy CTORs, assignment etc are missing) and the symmetry-aware operations (multiplies, diagonalization, etc) unit testing them on the way.

Testability,"Thanks for confirming, @jgonthier. In this case, I'm quite certain that the second-order SAPT(ROHF) results so far have been incorrect (except for maybe doublets?). @PhillCli's semicanonicalization fix does make the ROHF and UHF-based results match for two triplet helium atoms, and we should soon have a confirmation, on a few more test cases, that semicanonicalization is the way to go. When the fix is merged into Psi4, I will introduce a similar fix into the Psi4NumPy SAPT(ROHF) example (right now the Psi4NumPy and Psi results match because they are wrong in the same way).

Testability,"Thanks for making this into a written issue. This was discussed on Slack over a week ago, but not everyone may have seen it. All those test failures trace back to a ""delicate"" part of the OCC module. It has very slow orbital convergence. I [updated the default orbital convergence criteria in OCC to be the same as in DFOCC](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/1772/commits/896a7c22be5c72542b8773ca2a1b9164dee1fc2a), and for all the failing test cases, OCC simply can't converge the orbitals that tightly. You can see the issue about the OCC problem [here](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/1777). It traces back to OCC not coupling orbital and T2 amplitude DIIS, when in my experience, coupling them is crucial for good convergence. I'm in the process of fixing that, but it's slow. A lot of junk in the OCC module needed to be cleaned out to make the code less confusing before I can start making the actual fix. If you want to move that along, you can help by reviewing [the current cleanup PR](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/1789). I wanted to wait to write the next and final PR in the series until that one was accepted, but I may need to start on that now. Until that final PR gets in, we don't have conda builds and certainly can't have the next release. As you're probably wondering about this, these changes are also necessary for a paper I want submitted before I leave CCQC.

Testability,"Thanks for the reply - I have suspected the existence of an error in DFT gradients for more than a year because I have previously seen unexpected behavior in geomeTRIC / Psi4 geometry optimizations of organic molecules using DFT (B3LYP-D3/DZVP) in which the optimization fails to converge and the structure from the optimization trajectory appears to be tumbling (see attached movie). The behavior is more common when running optimizations with constraints. I suspected the DFT contribution because there is some literature on the lack of rotational invariance in DFT energies due to the grid, but I had not tested a constrained optimization on the same system using HF. I haven't made an issue report for this problem because I felt I lacked a test case that was compelling enough. . I thought the current issue had the same root cause as the organic molecule constrained optimizations, but I might be wrong about that. If you are seeing the gradient error in HF then I agree the current issue is not likely due to the DFT contribution to the energy. . https://github.com/psi4/psi4/assets/1441560/80f2b42d-fed2-4667-809d-f3a2550603fb",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/3066#issuecomment-1783717909:608,test,tested,608,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/3066#issuecomment-1783717909,2,['test'],"['test', 'tested']"

Testability,"Thanks for the update. I second what Susi said. In certain cases it is necessary to decontract the primary basis. Then the DF basis needs to be decontracted as well. We have not done extensive tests on this procedure and there is always the risk that linear dependency problems may arise, for which we do not yet have a good solution.

Burns <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>> wrote:. @WDerricottehttps://github.com/WDerricotte , @fevangelistahttps://github.com/fevangelista. I'm reworking the decontract functionality since that only existed c-side, but all basis sets are now built py-side. Basically, BASIS_X2C (formerly REL_BASIS) will always default to the decontracted orbital basis, if not set outright (set basis_x2c my_gigantic_uncontracted_basis). Is there ever a reason, then, to set the primary/orbital basis to a decontracted one (set basis cc-pvdz-decon)? If so, what fitting basis should a cc-pvdz-decon use: cc-pvdz-jkfit, cc-pvdz-jkfit-decon, unknown so give up? All the X2C test cases are with scf_type pk, none with DF.

As far as linear bends go, I bet the problem is the code is hardwired to expect no more than 6 interfragment coordinates, and with linear bends there could be more than 6.

What you're doing (Mac + GCC + indep numpy) should be perfectly do-able, but Psi needs MKL for best performance (and it's easy to get _wrong_ performance from other libs) and that means numpy needs to be MKL (whichever symbols of numpy or psi loaded first are what the other one has to use, so it's best if they're identical) so we encourage the conda groove for numpy.

Testability,"The large number of digits was introduced to eliminate round-off errors completely. There are a few reasons:. - When testing software that post-processes the wavefunction, it is desirable to be able to validate the numerical algorithms in such codes. For example, this can be done by checking the total number of electrons on very fine integration grids in such post-processing codes. When doing so, all other sources of errors should be eliminated to avoid confusion. We noticed that this was especially problematic before #1510 with fractionally occupied natural orbitals.; - When deriving approximate electrostatic models from a wavefunction, satisfying charge neutrality is quite important for long-range interactions. I know you can always ""fix"" this *a posteriori* (e.g. by shifting partial charges to match the net charge), but avoiding the need for a fix is still preferable, just to rule out sources of error. So why 17? The number of significant digits from a double precision number varies between 15 and 17.

Strictly, all external fields (including a field from a environment) should also be transformed. Currently, our PE-X2C-DFT implementation involves transformation only of the vacuum terms.

Testability,"The test that is currently failing is a test in `gcp/pbeh3c/`. This is due to an optking side issue where the `CustomHelper` class being used by optking is not accepting a `psi4.core.Molecule` the type checking was looking for `qcdb.Molecule`. As a backup optking defaulted to psi4's active molecule. This is the call.; `E = optimize('pbeh3c/def2-msvp', molecule=unopethene)`. optking takes the molecule here in the driver and uses a default fallback instead: ; ` opt_object = optking.opt_helper.CustomHelper(molecule, params=optimizer_params)`. The type check will get changed in optking to include `core.Molecule`. An alternative question this raises for me is whether the active_molecule should get updated at some point in the optimization.

Especially test threaded (but be aware of #2941 expected failures (also cc44, but that's behaving correctly to fail)).; * Be aware that c-f encourages packages to be built against a generic blas/lapack, so the user can select the blas implementation at runtime.

But Intel MKL isn't available for `osx-arm64` (quelle suprise). So I did the generic blas/lapack setup for this arch. You can choose `libblas=*=*openblas` or `libblas=*=*accelerate` for this arch. I'd be curious to hear about both. You'll get openblas if you don't specify.; * I've tested openblas on linux-64, and as long as you choose the openmp openblas variant, not the pthreads one, it works correctly (only the openmp variant is available for `osx-arm64`, so all's well).

Testability,"This bug is surprisingly straightforward, but figuring out the correct fix requires a lot of deep Psi knowledge. The `psio_` object of `occ` is set by a call to [the shallow_copy function](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/psi4/src/psi4/occ/occwave.cc#L50). This works fine when the reference wavefunction has a PSIO object. No part of the [`from_file` function](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/psi4/driver/p4util/python_helpers.py#L145-L221) gives the reference wavefunction a PSIO object. Unsurprisingly, you get a memory error when you try to use an uninitialized object. The other modules Holger tested don't have a problem because they don't use the reference wavefunction's PSIO. `fnocc` and `dfmp2`, for instance, make their own. Can anybody explain why we require the Wavefunction base class to have a PSIO object?

Otherwise, I agree with Lori about turning this off by default.

Testability,"This looks good to me - great work figuring this stuff out. I think the long-term plan will be to get all of the external perturbations into `MintsHelper` to avoid this kind of problem. However that's beyond the scope of this pull request. It would be nice to have a test case to prevent any regressions of this behavior: could you add a small molecule test (like the details you put on the forum post), by doing the following, please?. 1) Make a copy of an existing test folder, such as [this](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/master/tests/fsapt1) and call it something like `fisapt-ext`. 2) In the CMakeLists.txt in the newly created `fisapt-ext`, edit the name `fsapt1` to read `fsapt-ext` in the two locations where it is present. 3) Modify the `input.dat` to represent a small system with a small basis set and populate the `Eref` dictionary with values from running that system with your updated, working psi4 version: these will be checked against the computed values when the test is run. 4) If the test takes less that about 30 seconds (I doubt it will, but that depends on the size of system) then please add `quicktests` to the list of labels on the third line of `CMakeLists.txt` and remove the `PROPERTIES COST 400` from the following line: this will allow the test to be run every pull request. If not, it's too expensive to run every time so it'll just be run during our nightly tests instead. 5) When you have a working test case, please run it and generate the output file as `output.ref`, so that we have something to look at if any changes break this feature in the future. 6) Add the new `fsapt-ext` test name [here](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/tests/CMakeLists.txt#L60) so that our testing framework knows about it. I don't think you need the README or the `fsapt-ref` folder that are in that test directory, but I'm happy to be correct by other devs who know more about SAPT than I do.

Testability,"To summarise, it seems that running DF-MP2/3-21G is a bad idea for these small systems. The value of the interaction energy one gets, even with `E_CONVERGENCE` and `D_CONVERGENCE` at 1.0e-12, differs in the 4th DP based on which `DF_FITTING_CONDITION` is used. This caused the change in the energy during this PR (`df_fitting_condition 1.0e-10 -> 1.0e-12`). The def2-svp basis set is not affected nearly as much, as its fitting basis is better suited for the purpose. Switching the basis set in the test and tightening the energy/density convergence criteria to 1e-10 passes agreement with 1e-12 reference to 8DP's.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/1350#issuecomment-452840875:499,test,test,499,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/1350#issuecomment-452840875,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"We are _finally_ passing on Windows. The problem was quite subtle and involved treacherous raw pointers. The old code used `trans_one` and would pass in a pointer to position N in a `*double`, where N was the number of orbitals from previous irreps. The relevant test cases had a final irrep with no orbitals, so the old code would pass in a pointer to one position _after_ the last value. Which was fine, because it was never used. That stopped being fine, according to the Windows compiler, when I switched from `*double` to `std::array`. To be fair, trying to access a non-existent index should never have worked in the first place. The fix I adopted was to eliminate those `trans_one` calls with `libmints::Matrix` operations, with the result that we're using less specialized `libtrans` tech and fewer LoC.

Testability,We have a bit of a chicken and egg problem here with regard to getting this. This is likely waiting on EFP/PCM Python side stuff which is waiting on getting this in as some of the issues overlap. We can either merge the EFP/PCM/Python SCF iterations into this single PR or merge in the SCF iterations in *now* and patch up EFP/PCM later. Waiting on this however is likely a bad idea however as SCF is so fundamental to Psi and frequently is changed. While we have stated that psi4/psi4:master is only required to pass quick tests and only full releases require the full test suite to pass we have often stayed in the realm of having the full test suite pass all of the time. This has led users to pick up the current HEAD and using that as their main to get up to date features. This goes a bit into a larger discussion that we likely should mint more frequent minor updates so that we can feel free to break psi4/psi4:master as needed.

Testability,"While setting up a test I have noticed a couple of things. ; - None of the `CCxx` tests are actually checking `DIPOLE [x|y|z]` against a reference value.; - When doing an EOM calculation `psi4.core.ccdensity` is (internally c++ side) calling `psi4::ccdensity::dipole()` once per state. Inside `psi4::ccdensity::dipole()` the OPDM is sent into OEProp with the title set to ""CC"". That means at the end of this calculation if you try to grab one of the dipole components via `psi4.get_variable(""CC DIPOLE X"")` you are really getting what you would expect should be listed as `psi4.get_variable(""EOM-CC ROOT {last_root} DIPOLE X"")`. In addition to that you can't get the ground state dipole components at all since they were overwritten in the psivars dict with subsequent calls to the `psi4.core.ccdensity->psi::ccdensity::dipole->OEprop` chain.; - see [psi::ccdensity::dipole](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/psi4/src/psi4/ccdensity/dipole.cc#L61) code and follow into [OEProp](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/psi4/src/psi4/libmints/oeprop.cc#L1184) to see what I mean if you didn't follow the explanation above. . I think this very confusing when you look at how the dipole components for different roots can be grabbed with `psi4.get_variable` in the [ci-property tests](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/psi4/src/psi4/libmints/oeprop.cc#L1184) for example. . I propose ( and volunteer to make) the following changes in order to implement the test here, and avoid confusion in the future:; - For the 0th root (only one for non EOM-CC calculations) ccdensity will behave as is. ; - For any root after that it will pass `EOM-CC ROOT {root #}` into `oe->set_title()` [here](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/psi4/src/psi4/ccdensity/dipole.cc#L107) so that the confusing behavior with the variables dict is no longer as strange. ; - To test the original modification that this PR introduced I will: ; 1. extend `tests/cc54` to return the wfn which should now have Da/Db set",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/506#issuecomment-259597050:19,test,test,19,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/506#issuecomment-259597050,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

But some fail during the first SCF, some complete a few optimization cycles and a few complete. I have seen this behavior with the wB97x and the B3LYP functionals.; I have seen this with the conda installed 1.3rc2 and with a hand compiled version of 1.3rc2.; I have attached my input file and one of the smallest failed output files. I hope this helps pinning this down.; Thanks for working on Psi4, I love it!.

With regard to Daniel's suggested breakdown, we might try that but with; different names that might be even clearer:; - mintests - Minimal checking of psi; small number of tests, all of which; are short; - shorttests - Best coverage possible in a 20 minute envelope; - normaltests - Tests that would run automatically each night (could also; be nightlytests); - longtests - Any extra-long tests that were useful in debugging or; performance evaluation, but that are too long to reasonably run every night; (my understanding is that's what we mean now by this label).

Testability,"You're right, the handling of simint vec type is unsophisticated.

In that way, something like the below should do what you want. (The second is a standard CMake variable that means don't-look-for-prebuilt.). ```; -D SIMINT_VECTOR=avx; -D CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_simint=ON; ```. simint itself doesn't offer any handles for choosing an installation of a particular vectorization, nor does it provide any is-this-installation-compatible-with-given-vec handles. also, it's hard to know what the user wants: on an AVX computer (cmake can't quickly say that a computer is AVX, btw), a user getting a sse simint might be quite content b/c it'll run or discontent b/c it's unoptimized. Between the uncertainty and lack of tools, I went with the dumb handling you observed. For background, the conda package is sse so that it runs everywhere. And the cmake vector variable default is AVX since that's a likely minimum, and a wrong choice produces only local trouble.

Testability,"You're right, the inconsistency could be fixed the other way around by ""fixing"" the Z values instead. Though even if a new `molecular_weight` fn were implemented in `molecule` that lets me circumvent the mass issue when necessary, the problem is that there may be places other than `optrot.cc` that are returning incorrect masses without even knowing it. I suppose these codes could be tracked down and updated with some hunting. I'd be more than happy to make a PR and add such a function, and keep my eyes out for codes calculating molecular weight. However, I'm still not sure I understand the utility of retaining masses for ghosted atoms. With some testing, it looks like real -> ghost -> real is still possible using `extract_subsets` even if I set the mass of ghost atoms to zero. I tested this just by editing `Molecule::mass` in the way described above. What doesn't seem to be possible, on the other hand, is ghost -> real (where the atoms are read in originally as ghosts `Gh(C)`), but that doesn't seem to work right now anyway (not really sure why that is, may look into this if I have time).

Testability,"Your analysis of inconsistency and proposed fix are totally reasonable. But I disagree and rather have the opposite complaint about the Molecule class – that Z returns 0 instead of atomic number for ghost atoms so that function is actually conflating two independent quantities. mass is doing the right thing. The reason nonzero quantities are stored for ghost atoms in a CoordEntry is because the atoms can change their ghostedness upon `extract_subsets`, `activate_all_fragments`, etc. This leads to two tiers of ghostedness. The first are those that are read in as ghosts `@C` and get 0 Z and charge from the start. The others are those that are read in as real, then have their ghostedness changed on the fly. Note that Molecule internal fns sometimes have to check both `Molecule.fragment_types_` and `CoordEntry.ghost_` to get the full state of the Molecule. I've taken the back-away-slowly approach to ghosts in Molecule. And I have some memory of full-real-mol --> ghost-fragment-mol --> full-real-mol not actually being able to accomplish that last step. We tend to clone-manipulate-discard Mols these days rather than transform them internally, so our tests may not have noticed. In the [molrec dictionary repr](https://github.com/loriab/psi4/blob/pyvib2/psi4/driver/qcdb/molparse/tofrom.py#L78-L113) of a molecule, I've dropped fragment_types and consolidated the ghostedness. I've tried to keep the fields either totally independent (Z from real) or tied together (Z and symbol; to a lesser extent A, Z, symbol, mass). As far as getting things working for you, i'm inclined to suggest letting sleeping ghosts lie as far as internal Molecule structure. But go ahead and write a `molecular_weight` fn that accounts for both types of ghostedness internally and has a required bool argument as to whether or not mass of ghosts should be accounted for.

Testability,"Yup - adding the missing ```reset_occ = True``` fixes the issue -- however, the guess energy becomes very bad. (I'm not sure this can be solved; you'd just want to use a basis guess from a smaller one with the same ECP!). Anyway, the fix is in the ```sad_rohf``` branch, which will be merged for #1429. Unfortunately, the merge doesn't appear to be going anywhere until the ECPs are fixed, since the ```dfmp2-ecp``` test is producing junk if you change the guess, see #1433 . And this is exactly what happens with your example as well - once the occupations have been changed, the calculation gives the nonsensical result; ```; @DF-RHF iter 100: -259.15000393594977 5.10693e-09 3.69243e-01 DIIS.

Testability,"ace, if that makes the git operations easier.; > * edit sapt-dft1 test to be something like the below. This adds an extra section without the deltaHF correction. The analogous value in test sapt-dft2 is `DHF = -1.42620815`. This passes on master for me, so having the dHF=False pass on your PR will help verify the separate routing logic you added.

Testability,"all kinds of weirdness going on, let's see if this checks all of the boxes. . `test_psi4_scfproperty` was failing because the `properties` list was being overwritten, because `run_qcschema` was looking for properties in `model`. normally the calculation would have failed, but `_can_do_properties` was acting as a default list of properties (since it found none) and the test was only looking for a couple of things that happened to be in that list. . to fix it, `run_qcschema` now correctly checks the kwargs for the property list. `_can_do_properties` was renamed to `_default_properties`, and the function no longer filters the properties through it (if the property is not available, psi4 should fail gracefully). once that was fixed, the ""GRID_FIELD"" and ""GRID_ESP"" properties needed to be removed from that test since they failed (could not find some `grid.dat`, I'll let someone else chime in on that one). . also, added an additional test to hit the qc and wfn response vars (floats and arrays), both present in the `extras` return. I think this is the only test which checks the `extras` dictionary.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/2126#issuecomment-818163875:371,test,test,371,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/2126#issuecomment-818163875,4,['test'],['test']

Testability,"als are doubly occupied.; (""docc"" = ""doubly occupied""). Also, if you're doing a RAS, you need to tell the code the max number of; holes in RAS I, and the max number of particles in RAS III. I forget the; keywords off the top of my head. Additionally, if it's high-spin open-shell, at least to keep the SCF; straight (can't remember if DETCI needs this or not), you probably should; be specifying the symmetries of the singly occupied orbitals with the SOCC; keyword. There may or may not be some additional problems.

Testability,"ance `psi::outfile` is an instance that always redirects output to where the user asked. To use `psi::outfile` in your code, ensure `#include ""psi4-dec.h""` is at the top of your file and then proceed in one of two manners: :. ``` c++; #include ""psi4-dec.h""; //Option 1 (takes the same format strings as C's printf function); psi::outfile->Printf(<format_string>,<Message>);. //Option 2 (the C++ way); (*psi::outfile)<<""My Message in C++ form""<<std::endl;; ```. The choice of which of these two options to use is largely a matter of preference as internally the class does the same thing. It's also worth mentioning that there no longer is any reason to worry about flushing the buffer. In designing a library, that may be potentially used by various codes, the above code is not ideal as it breaks encapsulation by propagating the target program's code throughout the library. An integral part of library design is establishing an API that allows the library to respect the resource management paradigms of the target codes, but also doesn't lead to a mess of logic statements anytime a resource is needed within the library. This is best handled by a ""wrapper"" of some kind. Within an object-oriented coding paradigm, a (or a series of) resource allocating class(es) would be created. Then each time your library needs a resource it asks for it from an instance of this/these class(es). Alternatively, a C-like solution is to create a series of wrapper functions; your library then always obtains its resources from these functions. Regardless of which path is taken, the important point is that the specifics of how a target program allocates resources is now encapsulated within some interface, keeping your library clean and agnostic to the details. For concreteness I provide a C-like solution that provides an interface to Psi4's new outfile instance:. ``` c++; void MyPrinter(const std::string& Message){; (*psi::outfile)<<Message;; }. void FxnInMyCodeThatPrints(const int i, const int j){; std",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/77#issuecomment-83041867:2577,log,logic,2577,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/issues/77#issuecomment-83041867,1,['log'],['logic']
Testability,"ance where the value is slightly off and wonder why?. General guidance to for ref values to be from a tightly converged/optimized calc, then loosen the comparison check to accommodate the default/existing conv crit (https://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/add_tests.html#test-contents). Tests checking opt status at a certain cycle exempt of course. That's the principle, but do feel free to change as you see fit --- the reference values (agreed, preferred thing to change if the ref is the culprit) or the comparison crit (if it's the optimizer behavior that's the instigator). > Explanation:; I've expanded the number of tests I'm running since I started cleaning up core.cc. In the opt specific tests the convergence is usually tight enough that the nuclear repulsion energies match the reference values just fine for both optimizers. There are some tests like cc1-3 that are failing due to being just above threshold. atol = 0.001 the difference is ~ 0.0017. These tests are using the default qchem convergence criteria ~ 3e-4 max_force. Both optimizers finish well below the criteria and geometries match to 1e-4 Angstroms and 0.001 degrees. Geometries are the same. There are around 5 or 6 tests failing like this. Thanks for the explanation. I'd view reference NRE values as less venerable. For one thing, only those that caused trouble were even updated when physical constants changed, iirc. > Would y'all like this PR to include updated output.ref files for the tests or would a separate test updating PR be better? I don't see anything in the"" adding tests documentation"" about reference log files. I can include those as well if desired. It will just greatly increase the number of lines changed in this PR. Separate, please. Like updating `samples/`, better to keep the not-for-visual-inspection changes aside. Update: I see Jonathon thinks differently. Including is ok with me, now that GH allows files to be folded up rather than scrolled through.

Testability,"arify all the scaling factor and testing aspects of the PR, so we can move on to the I/O optimization and routing logic parts. Please let me know of any concerns.; > ; > * accept the various GH suggestions clarifying the scaling scheme changes (only if you agree with them, of course). Feel free to make the changes locally, rather than through the GH interface, if that makes the git operations easier.; > * edit sapt-dft1 test to be something like the below. This adds an extra section without the deltaHF correction. The analogous value in test sapt-dft2 is `DHF = -1.42620815`. This passes on master for me, so having the dHF=False pass on your PR will help verify the separate routing logic you added.
