This is because in broadcast assignment operations, such as `u[1][1:Nc, 1, k] .= u[5][2:Nc+1, 2, k]`, the data of the `WindowedField` is assigned. So, where's the issue? It's when we try any of the following operations:. 1. `u[1][1, 1:Nc, k] .= u[5][2:Nc+1, 2, k]`; 2. `view(u[1], 1, 1:Nc, k) .= u[5][2:Nc+1, 2, k]`; 3. `u[1][1, 1:Nc, k] .= u[5][2, 2:Nc+1, k]`; 4. `view(u[1], 1, 1:Nc, k) .= u[5][2, 2:Nc+1, k]`. Here the data extracted from the `WindowedField` on the RHS is always in the form of a column vector resulting in a dimension mismatch error. As a potential solution, we can consider assigning a `view` of the `WindowedField` as. 1. `u[1][1, 1:Nc, k] .= view(u[5], 2:Nc+1, 2, k)`; 2. `view(u[1], 1, 1:Nc, k) .= view(u[5], 2:Nc+1, 2, k)`; 3. `u[1][1, 1:Nc, k] .= view(u[5], 2, 2:Nc+1, k)`; 4. `view(u[1], 1, 1:Nc, k) .= view(u[5], 2, 2:Nc+1, k)`. or the transpose of the `WindowedField` as. 1. `u[1][1, 1:Nc, k] .= u[5][2:Nc+1, 2, k]'`; 2. `view(u[1], 1, 1:Nc, k) .= u[5][2:Nc+1, 2, k]'`; 3. `u[1][1, 1:Nc, k] .= u[5][2, 2:Nc+1, k]'`; 4. `view(u[1], 1, 1:Nc, k) .= u[5][2, 2:Nc+1, k]'`. It turns out only the second approach results in the correct solution. ```julia; julia> u[1][:, :, 1]; 12×12 OffsetArray(::Matrix{Float64}, -3:8, -3:8) with eltype Float64 with indices -3:8×-3:8:; 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3361#issuecomment-2035885538:9459,error,error,9459,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3361#issuecomment-2035885538,1,['error'],['error']

Availability," errors are present even in the initial velocities and the diagnosed initial vorticity. The vorticity error is significantly pronounced near the cubed sphere corners due to the deviation from orthogonality. For instance, in the domain's interior, the vorticity error norm is three orders of magnitude less than the vorticity norm, whereas at the corners, it is nearly the same order of magnitude.; - As the simulation progresses, the amplified error from the corners propagates into the interior as expected. After 500 time steps, the vorticity error in the interior increases from three orders of magnitude less to one order of magnitude less than the vorticity norm. I have attached panel-wise plots of the exact vorticity and the error of its numerical counterpart on the cubed sphere for the initial condition and after 500 time steps for reference. Given these circumstances, @navidcy and I are contemplating whether we should continue using the exact solution for verification in the test script or consider alternative verification methods, such as ensuring that the norm of the numerical solution of the Rossby-Haurwitz wave remains bounded within a specified range (as mentioned in the introduction to this PR). @glwagner, @simone-silvestri and @jm-c, let us know your thoughts. **Exact initial vorticity**. ![cubed_sphere_rossby_haurwitz_wave_ζ₀_exact](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/12926768/ec936d28-49e5-4da2-9f49-783e517b6f0c). **Error in initial vorticity**. ![cubed_sphere_rossby_haurwitz_wave_ζ₀_error](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/12926768/59374933-eeab-417b-adfe-56eb1e2e5673). **Exact vorticity after 500 time steps**. ![cubed_sphere_rossby_haurwitz_wave_ζ_exact](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/12926768/15c81d0c-239e-42ad-a740-8505bd3a4a35). **Error in vorticity after 500 time steps**. ![cubed_sphere_rossby_haurwitz_wave_ζ_error](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/assets/12926768/9209cb44-860b-4a88-8d4a-946d1143da7c)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3570#issuecomment-2134152684:2210,Error,Error,2210,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3570#issuecomment-2134152684,2,['Error'],['Error']

Availability," if we consider for now just a 1D problem with boundary point $\phi_b$ and interior points at $\phi_{b-1}$ etc. When we go to update the boundary point we have $\phi_b^n$ and $\phi_{b-1}^{n+1}$ and we want $\phi_b^{n+1}$. As per previous work we assume that the bulk speed is the same at both $b$ and $b-1$ but we don't have both the spatial and time derivatives of the $\phi$ interior at the same step so we first need to approximate the previous step as:. $\phi_{b-i}^n = \phi_{b-i}^{n+1}-\Delta t G^n_{b+1}$. We can then find the bulk velocity at timestep n as:. $U_b^n = -\frac{2\Delta x_{b-1}G^n_{b-1}}{\phi^n_b - \phi^{n+1}_{b-2} - \Delta t G^n _{b-2}}$. We then have all the information to step $\phi_b$ to:. $\phi_b^{n+1}=\phi_b^n-\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x_b}U_b(\phi_b^n-\phi_{b-1}^{n+1} - \Delta t G^n_{b-1})$. This will require us to give the boundary condition both the tendencies and $\Delta t$, but this seems to be the easiest thing to change. I also think this is the only way we can get a physically sensible bulk speed where all of the components are calculated at the same timestep. I have also realised that we need to have an exterior value for every open boundary for when the flow spontaneously becomes an inflow so I think it would make sense to have every open boundary be the same and just be `OpenBoundaryCondition(external_value)`, and then put the tendencies etc in as arguments to `_fill_X_halo!`. Then when `U_b` is negative we either set the value or do nudging like in ROMS to prevent shocks (but I think this is a question for further down the line). We might also want to consider oblique waves but that shouldn't be too hard to extend to we might just have to calculate a lot of surrounding points which might motivate some other way to do it. Does this make sense to everyone? I also can't see an obvious way to get $\Delta t$ to the halo fill since it doesn't even make it into the `update_state!` so any suggestions would be appreciated.

Availability," makes some significant source code changes for what I think is a rather narrow application, which is disproportional compared to most of the other features we have I think. > If for some reason we cannot use a forcing function approach, we'll have to think carefully about how to design a flexible user API for ""particle-induced tracer forcing"". I think if we are going to add this then it should be more general than just a source/sink calculation --- ie, we should attempt to have a small source code addition that makes a wide range of new behavior possible, if we can. I've reconsidered this now and think we may not even need any source code change to properly implement this behaviour and integrate some particle induced tracer forcing. If we have a model with some tracers `(:A, :B)` which we want to force with some particles, we can define an auxiliary field `G\_p=TracerFields((:A, :B), grid)`. We can then have a particle dynamics function that modifies `model.auxiliary_fields.G\_p`, for example sets the points surrounding the particles to `-A[i, j, k]` for `A`, and `+A[i, j, k]` for `B` like in my example above. You can then define a discrete forcing function for each of the tracers like `a_forcing(i, j, k, grid, clock, model_fields) = model_fields.G\_p.A[i, j, k]` etc. (this would only work with my other PR #2733 added so that the `auxiliary_fields` are available). > It seems the memory requirement of the forcing function approach is proportional to the number of tracers, not the number of particles --- right? We would nee an ""auxiliary tendency"" for every tracer; the memory requirement doesn't change based on the number of particles. My reservation with this was that if there's e.g. 1 particle effecting loads of tracers you have to store lots more fields, but I see now that this is much less of an issue. Sorry about making this much more complicated than it should have been!.

Availability," one of its locations is `Nothing`, rather than `Face` or `Center`. I think the issue here is that there are a few flavors of ""reduced fields"":. * ""Sliced fields"", which have reduced dimensionality, but still have a ""position"" in 3D space. These may be fields that exist only on boundaries, like the free surface, ice concentration, boundary conditions, etc. It should also be valid to define ""sliced fields"" at other positions / indices, inside the domain. If one of the ranges has a length 1, then the field is ""2.5 dimensional""... ?; * _Truly_ two-dimensional fields derived from a reduction operation, like `Average` or `Integral`. These fields have no position in the reduced dimension. To express the above in code, we might introduce a new location, perhaps `Level` (`Slice`, `Layer`, `Plane`...), which maybe stores both an integer `index` and the ""underlying location"". The free surface might have the location `Level{Face}(grid.Nz+1)` in the vertical (for example). I'm unsure the best solution to the masking issue. For 2.5D fields, the answer is clear: we need to evaluate `solid_interface` at the actual ""location"" of the field. Right now `Nothing` in the vertical means `k -> 1`. But this is _wrong_, as this issue identifies. If we have a new location `Level`, we can evaluate `solid_interface` at `Level.index` (for example). For truly 2D fields, it's murkier. I think in _general_ if one wants to identify whether an _entire_ dimension is masked, there's little choice but to evaluate the masking function at every index in that dimension. But there are special cases for which the job is a bit easier, because we encode assumptions about the shape of the immersed boundary. For example, `GridFittedBottom` assumes that masking occurs at every location _below_ a specified depth. Thus, a column can be identified as masked by evaluating `solid_interface` at the upper grid point, eg `k = grid.Nz`. So, we have a design problem on our hands to figure out how to represent these ideas i",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2177#issuecomment-1021328044:1086,mask,masking,1086,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2177#issuecomment-1021328044,2,['mask'],['masking']

Here's what we have:. * All `Field`s have `indices`. We can define fields that are essentialy _views_ into other fields, but ""sliced"" at particular indices. We can also define abstract operations that slice a portion of the domain.; * We have output writers that can compute and output sliced fields. ; * We have an `indices` kwarg for output writers that _automagically_ will _slice every output_ along the provided indices. This is convenient, but fails to cover the case that we want to slice all 3D fields, but leave fields that are _already sliced_ untouched. A few solutions:. * Throw a `BoundsError` when we attempt to ""re-slice"" a field in a way that's invalid. For example, we cannot slice a field with `k=Nz+1` at the index `k=Nz`. This is how Base julia works:. ```julia; julia> a = rand(2, 3); 2×3 Matrix{Float64}:; 0.493349 0.161279 0.244427; 0.288415 0.0111998 0.543645. julia> b = view(a, :, 4:4); ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2×3 Matrix{Float64} at index [1:2, 4:4]; Stacktrace:; [1] throw_boundserror(A::Matrix{Float64}, I::Tuple{Base.Slice{Base.OneTo{Int64}}, UnitRange{Int64}}); @ Base ./abstractarray.jl:651; [2] checkbounds; @ ./abstractarray.jl:616 [inlined]; [3] view(::Matrix{Float64}, ::Function, ::UnitRange{Int64}); @ Base ./subarray.jl:177; [4] top-level scope; @ REPL[36]:1; ```. * Add new features that help us build output in a sensible way. One idea is a macro that looks something like. ```julia; us, vs, ws, Ts = @indices (:, :, Nz) u v w T; ```. This would be equivalent to writing something like. ```julia; us = Field(u, indices=(:, :, Nz)); vs = Field(v, indices=(:, :, Nz)); ws = Field(w, indices=(:, :, Nz)); Ts = Field(T, indices=(:, :, Nz)); ```. Then, if users want to output surface fields _and_ the free surface, they should use this method rather than the `indices` kwarg.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2770#issuecomment-1268590520:1579,ERROR,ERROR,1579,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2770#issuecomment-1268590520,1,['ERROR'],['ERROR']

Availability,". But now I realize that because of the status of the immersed Poisson solver, the velocity along the boundary is divergent, strongly so. So, `div(u')` is large along the boundary. And when we divide by `Δt` we get something huge. The magnitude of `div(u')` also somehow seems to depend on the time step (as does the magnitude of the spurious circulation). The correct solution to this case remains at rest of course. (An aside is that this problem _could_ be avoided by separately computing the hydrostatic pressure, and then using a special horizontal gradient operators that avoid computing a hydrostatic pressure gradient across an immersed boundary. However, this would only be correct for no-flux boundary conditions on buoyancy on side walls). Anyways, apparently because of this issue with the immersed pressure solver, it seems that `div(u')` is large (because `div(u)` is large) even when `Δt = O(1e-14)`... - As a result of all of this I am confused about whether this MWE is actually reliable for debugging the issue. I guess we should expect to see problems simply when `Δt = O(eps)` because this is when `div(u') / Δt` cannot be reliably computed, I think. This leads to a fairly simple criteria for the time step that's compatible with the pressure correction. But as noted in this PR, this is not enough to fix issues with the immersed boundary MWE... but whether or not that is because of problems with the setup itself, I'm not sure... - All of that said, taking @tomchor suggestion to be more careful in updating the clock for RK3 actually does solve the MWE here. Obviously, this is again addressing the (in principle not entirely solvable) issue of error accumulation in `clock.time`, rather than addressing the other issue with very small time-steps producing an ill-posed pressure correction. I think we should fix RK3 separately, basically because we cannot completely avoid accumulating error in `clock.time`, every little thing we do to make it more accurate is a good idea.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3606#issuecomment-2153020136:1894,reliab,reliably,1894,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3606#issuecomment-2153020136,6,"['error', 'reliab']","['error', 'reliably']"

I observed that QAB2 then starts to differ at the next time step. I suppose the differences in the `RK3` method appear sooner because it is a multistep method, so three steps in one?. I know that the pressure solve is what differs significantly between the `CPU` and `GPU` approaches but are these reasonable errors or do these seem too big?. I can say that the errors at the boundary happen with both time stepping methods. So I cannot run this example on a GPU because of this numerical instability that develops.

It actually looks like some, but not all of the issue there have been solved. A minimal example is:. ```julia; julia> U = AveragedField(u, dims=(1, 2)); AveragedField over dims=(1, 2) located at (⋅, ⋅, Center) of Field located at (Face, Center, Center); ├── data: OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64,3,CUDA.CuArray{Float64,3}}, size: (1, 1, 3); ├── grid: RegularRectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded}(Nx=1, Ny=1, Nz=1); ├── dims: (1, 2); ├── operand: Field located at (Face, Center, Center); └── status: time=0.0. julia> compute!(ComputedField(u - U)). julia> compute!(ComputedField((u - U)^2)). julia> V = AveragedField(v, dims=(1, 2)); AveragedField over dims=(1, 2) located at (⋅, ⋅, Center) of Field located at (Center, Face, Center); ├── data: OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64,3,CUDA.CuArray{Float64,3}}, ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1241#issuecomment-821872338:4150,error,errors,4150,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1241#issuecomment-821872338,1,['error'],['errors']

It's easier for the compiler to optimize code that involves `ifelse`, especially on the GPU. The reason is that it's allowed to execute all code on both branches. If we use short-circuiting logic, then I guess many optimizations are not possible, because execution on one branch or another must be completely excluded.

Availability,"> 1. Modify the CG method to make it numerically stably for positive semi-definite matrices. Right, although I am not sure that this is done correctly in this PR.

I create a new matrix. > $$\tilde{A} = A + cv_0v_0^\dagger$$. > where $c$ is a positive real number and $v_0$ is the basis of the null space of $A$. I was a bit confused about the motivation for defining a new matrix, but with some help from @amontoison I feel I understand this better. The basic idea applies to any semi-definite system; the idea is to ""shift"" an operator by the identity:. $$ \tilde A = A + \epsilon I $$. Where $\epsilon$ is a constant. The key to this method is the smallness of $\epsilon$. Note that we are solving a different system: if the original system is $A x = b$, then the new system is. $$ \left (A + \epsilon I \right ) y = b $$. We do not automatically have $y=x$ or even $y \approx x$. However, we may have $y \approx x$ when $\epsilon$ is smaller than the tolerance of the underlying CG algorithm, for example. In addition to making $\epsilon$ small, another strategy to recover $x$ from $y$ is to solve a new system:. $$ A z = b - A y $$. which, we can show, allows us to recover $x$ via $x = y + z$. For the purpose of implementing shifted operators, some methods in Krylov.jl support provision of a ""shift"" as an argument to the solver, eg the argument `λ` here: https://jso.dev/Krylov.jl/dev/solvers/sid/#Krylov.symmlq. It'd be easy to support a shift of the Poisson operator, the caveat being that the problem being solved is no longer exact.

Availability,"> 1. Should we change the flux convention in Oceananigans so that `FluxBoundaryCondition` specifies the flux along the _inward pointing normal_? This reverses the convention we use on ""right"" boundaries (west, north, top). For example, a negative buoyancy flux would cause cooling at the surface with this convention. This is a huge change, but I think is necessary to do things like specifying a drag boundary condition on vertical velocity (I can discuss further why this is the case if needed.). I quite like the current convention for specifying fluxes since (imho) it's more mathematically intuitive, so my vote goes to maintaining that convention if we can (although I agree that it makes it harder to apply it generally for immersed solids...). One way to do it would be to leave most of the heavy work for the user, which would have to specify fluxes in each of the immersed solid's interfaces separately. The user's script would look like what I did here:; https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/faed0c4ac85409cb94811b0bdba2bbb7becf330a/sandbox/drag_test.jl#L25-L41. The downside is that this won't work for non-grid-fitted boundaries and requires more user-written code. The upside is that could (I think) re-use much of the inner-workings of the current BC implementation. > We can do 2. without 1. In that case we'll be able to support a lot of common cases, including ordinary oceanic cases (where boundaries do not overhang, and we only specify drag on tangential components). It's really LES cases that become tricky because we can't specify drag on vertical velocity components, or on tangential components when the boundary overhangs. Not sure I understand this point. Do you mind clarifying @glwagner? By ""overhang"" do you mean that there's no fluid-to-the-bottom-immersed-boundary-to-the-top interface?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-1086345975:1087,down,downside,1087,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-1086345975,2,['down'],['downside']
Availability,"> 2\. It would be a good idea in my opinion to support either options of passing the prefix or the filename (as many softwares do) so that we always preservw the extension which I believe is our priority. (Just implement a check on the last relevant characters, if there is a correct extension leave it as is otherwise append it). I think this is an excellent suggestion!. We can do. ```julia; dotindex = findlast('.', filename); possible_ext = isnothing(dotindex) ? """" : filename[dotindex+1:end]; possible_ext == "".nc"" || filename *= "".nc""; ```. We can put similar logic into `FieldTimeSeries`. I was stuck on trying to throw an error if the ext is wrong, which has the major downside that we can't use `.` in filenames anymore. But this is a pretty nice solution I think. The main downside is that if you accidentally call your file `.jld2` for netcdf then you'll end up with a file `.jld2.nc`. But I think we can just _recommend_ that `filename` has no extension and we figure it out. And we also support explicit extensions for users that want that interface, with the caveat that if they screw up they'll have funny filenames.

What you propose is what I should have written down before. That would be how to specify the stretched grid using an array. Otherwise, you could pass a function. Okay, thanks for the clarification! So you're proposing something like. ```julia; VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid(FT, size=(1, 1, Nz), x=(0, 1), y=(0, 1), z=(0, Lz), z_stretch=collect(0:Δz:Lz)); ```.

One can envision a general form of this where the following alternatives are all valid and the rest is inferred from the constructor:. ```julia; z_grid = ArbitrarilyStretchedRectilinearGrid(FT, size=(1, 1, Nz), x=(0, 1), y=(0, 1), z_stretch=collect(0:Δz:Lz)); y_grid = ArbitrarilyStretchedRectilinearGrid(FT, size=(1, 1, Nz), x=(0, 1), z=(0, 1), y_stretch=collect(0:Δz:Lz)); x_grid = ArbitrarilyStretchedRectilinearGrid(FT, size=(1, 1, Nz), y=(0, 1), z=(0, 1), x_stretch=collect(0:Δz:Lz)); ```. In my opinion this is better since it's a little cleaner (although it may require some more programming on the background). Also, I think `z_stretch` is less clear than `zF`, no?

Availability,"> > Does it have to do with output? Do you know what the time-step is when this happens?I'm wondering if it has to do with using a very small time-step, leading to a round-off error issue. That would also explain why it doesn't affect dynamics, because huge pressure gradient integrated over a machine epsilon duration may not have an impact.; > ; > Are you referring to the fact that sometimes `model` has to use a very tiny time-step to bridge the gap between the current time and the output time? If so, that's an interesting possibility that I hadn't considered. Although in the example above I'm fixing the time-step at `25`, while the output time interval is `200`, so I wouldn't expect any issues there. Can you check just to be sure? Because having an output interval that's some multiple of the time step is exactly when we expect to see miniscule time-steps due to round off error. The pressure source term is the divergence of the predictor velocity divided by time-step. As the time-step vanishes, the divergence of the predictor velocity also vanishes (because the flow has not evolved from its previous, non-divergent solution). We get a situation tending to 0/0. I think there's a few things we could do to solve this. First of all if we take a very small time-step, I think we can actually just re-set the model time rather than taking a time-step. Second I am wondering if we want to implement a time type that has finite resolution (ie there is a smallest time increment one can take). For example, datetimes have a smallest unit (micro or nanoseconds). A non-dimensional or dimensional-agnostic time type could also be designed analogously (eg every time is the multiple of an integer by the fundamental unit). This would eliminate round off error but it's a bit of work and also we have to put some thought into how best to accomplish it.

After all the diffusive cfl is as much of a necessary condition for convergence as the advective cfl, it just is a limiting-factor less often for oceanic simulations. But I'm okay with keeping the current behavior as well. I certainly don't disagree that it's convenient; the question is more whether the benefit justifies the cost. Users also want a code that's easy to maintain and extend because then they get more features! For constant diffusivities, the CFL constraint can be pre-calculated. For some common closures the calculation is simple, but this is not _generically_ the case for all turbulence closures. It's really only for variable diffusivities that we _need_ a feature for on-the-fly calculation. We could also use something like `diffusive_cfl=nothing` which completely avoids the calculation. Then we can justify supporting a diffusive CFL calculation for selected turbulence closures. That might be a good route (discussion for another issue).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2205#issuecomment-1025985247:219,mainten,maintenance,219,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2205#issuecomment-1025985247,2,['mainten'],['maintenance']

If the precomputation is storing values in an `Array` or `CuArray` (which is already mutable) then no. If you need to precompute a number for every boundary, then yes you need something mutable. But it looks like this would not involve the `BoundaryCondition` itself but rather a component of the boundary condition (eg the `condition` or the `classification`). None of this is hard though.

I think for sophisticated research Checkpointing is common, but for simpler classroom and LES applications the checkpointer is used less. After all, probably the most simulations are actually run in our examples on CI -- and there are no examples with a checkpointer! (It would be nice to change that). I can't speak for others, but for boundary layer parameterization work the LES typically run in less than 24 hours of wall time. We also only utilize very simple diagnostics, like the horizontally-averaged solution at the final time step. So in those rare cases that we need a checkpointer (I have used a handful of times) barebones checkpointing is sufficient.

If there are ways to make it shorter or better, we should definitely do that in this PR rather than later!. I can elaborate. What I meant is that this example, although it's Literate-ready, it does not provide any explanation to the reader about what's coming. All other examples come with remarks of the sort ""we now build the grid""... ""Next, let's form a model with two tracers..."", ""now all what's left to do is to run the simulation""... On the other hand, this example just list down the commands without any explanation. I'm not saying that's bad. It's just different from the rest of the examples. I think it's perfect for the README file but. in my opinion, you don't wanna see this as your first example if you are reading the docs because it doesn't really take you from the hand and guide you to feel welcome in all this new Oceananigans.jl terminology. To conclude: I think we should add it to the Literate examples list, e.g., in `docs/make.jl`. ```julia; examples = [; ""hello_ocean.jl"",; ""one_dimensional_diffusion.jl"",; ""two_dimensional_turbulence.jl"",; ""internal_wave.jl"",; ""convecting_plankton.jl"",; ""ocean_wind_mixing_and_convection.jl"",; ""langmuir_turbulence.jl"",; ""eady_turbulence.jl"",; ""kelvin_helmholtz_instability.jl""; ]. for example in examples; example_filepath = joinpath(EXAMPLES_DIR, example); Literate.markdown(example_filepath, OUTPUT_DIR, documenter=true); end; ```. This way, docs will fail if the code cannot run the `hello_ocean.jl`. But we shouldn't add it in th e; but don't in the `example_pages` list. Rather, we should include this as part of the README.

Availability,"> > We would need CUDA 3.8.0 to develop multiGPU architectures without having to use MPI.; > > You mind if I revamp this PR and try to see what we need to do to update CUDA?

Do you know of any scaling results that people have done using this multiGPU approach? I'd be keen to try this with Oceananigans when it's working. I know that we tried using MPI and GPU last summer and had some problems. One, getting it to work was a pain. Two, the effiicency dropped down to 60% when going fro 1 to 2 GPUs. I now we can do better, and maybe this is a way of doing that. One key problem to solve is that we cannot pass non-contiguous data between GPUs without scalar operations. This affects both ""direct"" communication via the CUDA.jl API and cuda-aware MPI. As a result passing non-continuous data is _extremely_ slow and is probably the primary reason for the abysmal multi-GPU scaling we saw. I believe @simone-silvestri is going to use a single layer buffer to pass halo data (copy halo to buffer, pass to buffer on remote device, then copy from remote buffer to remote halo).

(copy-pasting from #2618). One possibility is that there is a type promotion occurring within `align_time_step`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/e16cdc6cfb67703df9e29368017868331f68b1c0/src/Simulations/run.jl#L24-L33. and. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/e16cdc6cfb67703df9e29368017868331f68b1c0/src/Simulations/run.jl#L133-L134. This would cause widespread issues in switching to single precision, so @simone-silvestri may want to take note. The quick fix is to convert after calculating the aligned time-step:. ```julia; Δt = aligned_time_step(sim, sim.Δt); Δt = convert(eltype(sim.model), Δt); ```. I think we need a more defined interface for this in the long run though. We really need both `eltype` (the floating point type used by state variables, grid metrics, etc) and a `timetype` (the type of `model.clock.time`). .

I tried setting up a simulation with `closure = (AnisotropicMinimumDissipation(), ScalarDiffusivity(ν=κ,κ=κ))` but am getting errors with `no method matching south_ib_flux`. Could this be specific to immersed boundary or has the turbulence closure definition of the molecular values of kinematic viscosity and diffusivity changed since #1277?. Here's a question. Doing wall-resolved LES is a bit tricky here. In the way the code is written, the diffusivity for wall fluxes with value or gradient boundary condition is derived from the model closure. For closure tuples, the logical thing to do is to add all the diffusivities together to come up with the immersed flux. However, this means that to do wall resolved LES we have to solve a tricky problem which is how to specify that the LES diffusivity has a value of 0 on the boundary. The interface implemented here doesn't support that; when we write `ValueBoundaryCondition(0)` what that means is that we add fluxes to a tendency consistent with `ValueBoundaryCondition(0)`. (The alternative, which would essentially mean ""return `0` when the field is reconstructed on boundary faces"" requires feeding boundary conditions into the reconstruction operator used by the closure. Doing that would substantially complicate the code.) This means effectively that there's no way to set the LES diffusivity to 0 on an immersed boundary. Even if there were a way to ensure this, it's also inconvenient to have to specify boundary conditions on the LES diffusivities... An alternative approach might attach a diffusivity / viscosity to the immersed boundary condition. Then the closure is ignored when calculating the immersed flux and the ""boundary diffusivity"" is used instead. This has some convenience downsides (ie diffusivity values have to be passed both to the closure _and_ the boundary condition), but would a",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2437#issuecomment-1107321166:265,error,errors,265,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2437#issuecomment-1107321166,1,['error'],['errors']

Availability,"> @tomchor @whitleyv what's the ultimate vision for this PR. I think we just want to add a more ""precise"" drag option to IB by using the `conditional_flux` functions, so that a drag can be added at the exact locations that need it for the grid fitted version, while also avoiding the user having to call the correct conditional for each location. (For context, when adding drag to IB I have been just adding drag as a forcing over a cell-width above the boundary. So I'd prefer something a little more exact.) Hard coding this option in is mostly a test to see how it would go while using the available framework, before creating a full method that users would be able to implement nicely. . Implementing immersed boundary conditions as a separate term would work, I believe! A `value` immersed option wouldn't involve as much effort (as we've previously worked out for no slip), besides getting the direction correct. I think, one of our concerns was the interpolating of field dependencies within a functional form of a boundary condition, and how they would interact with the IB, could it be generalized to any input.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2275#issuecomment-1075635953:593,avail,available,593,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2275#issuecomment-1075635953,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"> @tomchor can you clarify what you mean when you say you expected the ""gaussian function to be set-up with a sharp cut-off""? Do you mean you expected the width of the Gaussian to be narrower?. No, I mean I expected the sponge layer to be confined to a finite part of the domain. That is, I expected the sponge layer to be _identically_ zero for most of the domain. Us not ""being on the same page"" here (for the lack of a better description! haha) may be due to different philosophies of what a sponge layer should be. So, due to my background, a sponge layer should be a function that _only_ acts in a _finite_ part of the domain. So, for example, in my code I set-up the sponge layer mask as. ```; mask = H(-(z-z₀)) ⋅ (z - z₀)² / (z₁ - z₀)²; ```; with H(z) being the Heaviside function. Comparing this to the Gaussian mask, this has a disadvantage of not being as smooth (although it should be smooth enough because of the (z - z₀)² / (z₁ - z₀)² term, and we can always increase the order of the exponents). However it has a very important advantage: I know _exactly_ when it stops influencing my solution. So I know that in the range `(z₀, max(z)]` my solver is solving the NS equations (plus or minus some approximations) without any added nonphysical term. I was always taught (and I still agree) that setting up a sponge layer mask as something that only reaches zero at infinity (like a Gaussian) is not recommended since you don't know when do start believing your solution. In practice if you're 4σs away from the center of the Gaussian you're pretty sure that the sponge layer influences are minimal (but they're not exactly zero!). But a harder question is: how far away is far enough?. A note here should be that if my mask was simply `mask = H(-(z-z₀))` it would probably fail as a sponge layer because, as @navidcy and @glwagner have pointed out, it would reflect a ton of waves. So the transition should be done with care.

Availability,"> @tomchor since you're the main person using the tilted gravity feature, I'm wondering if you can help provide some insight into this ""stratified fluid at rest"" test. The main issue is that the dynamics can be ""correct"" but the test can fail. I feel its a bad test for this reason. I don't have much to add to the discussion. I agree with you that a balanced state in a continuous system doesn't necessarily translate exactly to a discrete one. When I (or Ali?) came up with this test I figured this translation error would be small enough to be acceptable, and when the test actually passed I was happy enough with that. So if this translation error is indeed large enough with the new solver that the tests don't pass I'm very much okay with changing the test. I can't, for the moment, think of another simple test to replace it though. My best guess is to do something similar to what I did for the rotated Coriolis: solve a system with gravity pointing upwards and then the same system with gravity pointing to the `x` or `y` direction and see if they match after the proper rotation.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1910#issuecomment-890043769:513,error,error,513,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1910#issuecomment-890043769,4,['error'],['error']

Availability,"> A short summary of the physics of this example and what we expect to see would be useful for helping debug issues with the setup. @wenegrat Feel free to correct / chime-in here. But here's a short summary from what I understand:. This script simulates a bottom boundary layer developing over a sloping bottom. This is simulated in a horizontally-periodic set-up (horizontally meaning parallel to the bathymetry) starting from rest with a uniform flow in the y-direction that is immediately subject to bottom drag. The interaction between flow and topography creates a bottom Ekman layer with downslope Ekman transport that crosses isobaths and advects lighter fluid under dense fluid, creating convective mixing. Furthermore, when this BBL reaches thermal wind balance (or possibly even earlier than that I guess) it also creates a region of negative potential vorticity, which is unstable to symmetric/centrifugal instabilities. So basically we expect turbulence at the bottom due to gravitational and symmetric/centrifugal instabilities (in addition to the some shear instabilities I guess).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1498#issuecomment-885211037:594,down,downslope,594,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1498#issuecomment-885211037,1,['down'],['downslope']

Would this not be an issue if users have to explicitly declare the list of tracers?. Working on some biogeochemistry stuff with @seamanticscience, I came to the conclusion that the ""auto-adding"" of tracers has some definite downsides, like you easily forget what the tracer names are. The fact is that you have to know what the tracer names are anyways to set initial conditions. So I'm leaning towards requiring that users add tracers explicitly.

Availability,"> Another option is to pass FT=Float32 to the model and then let the constructor convert related components to Float32 (or Float64 if FT=Float64 is passed). I feel it might be the most user-friendly interface. But obviously it will lots of efforts to implement. This could work but I'm wary of converting in general. When we convert, then identity is lost between whatever the `component` in the user script and `model.component`. This is an especially major problem for `grid`. But even if we implement this feature via the grid, there would be many other types like `FPlane(f=1)` for example which have the incorrect type. We can tell users that this is possible so they always need to use `model.coriolis`. But broadly I think this kind of design is a bit brittle; too easy for things to go wrong. > Actually, I think it would be better to define a function Oceananigans.set_default_number_type(FT) for users to access the ""setting"" dictionary.

The CUDA.jl docs recommend using artifacts (https://cuda.juliagpu.org/dev/installation/overview/#CUDA-toolkit) but this may be because new users are less likely to encounter issues if they use the artifacts (which usually work out of the box) instead of fidgeting with local installs especially on servers without root access.

Luckily, I found a reliable way to get NaNs immediately is to set both `reltol` and `abstol` to zero and `maxiter` to more than a thousand. The purpose is to test the numerical stability of the iteration method. My theory is that the current CG iteration solver is numerically unstable.

Do you know what the time-step is when this happens?I'm wondering if it has to do with using a very small time-step, leading to a round-off error issue. That would also explain why it doesn't affect dynamics, because huge pressure gradient integrated over a machine epsilon duration may not have an impact. Are you referring to the fact that sometimes `model` has to use a very tiny time-step to bridge the gap between the current time and the output time? If so, that's an interesting possibility that I hadn't considered. Although in the example above I'm fixing the time-step at `25`, while the output time interval is `200`, so I wouldn't expect any issues there.

Availability,"> Edit: Possibly could just remove a lot of the information from the fields using the `adapt_structure` method from [PR #1057](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1057)?. We already do ""unwrap"" data from fields on the GPU:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/ea6826fd2ffaed3f0df330cc952667ec878deb6a/src/Fields/field.jl#L368. > I realised it would be much harder to reduce the parameter size of the tracer tendency function if the tracers depend on lots of other tracers. Okay, this makes sense. Solving the problem for `calculate_Gu` just bumps the error down to `calculate_tracer_tendency`, and the issue isn't tractable in that case, since it's clearly important to support tracer forcing functions that depend on other tracers (eg for biogeochemical models). Can you provide a minimum script that reproduces the error? I do think many tracers is an important use case so solving this could warrant reducing the kinds of forcing functions we support --- if that's necessary. I think there also may be solutions that don't change what we support while still solving this problem; eg we provide some features that extend model capabilities specifically for the case of large numbers of tracers. For example, we could avoid passing the tracers explicitly into the kernels. Instead, we can attach references _only_ to the relevant / used fields directly in `Forcing` (we'd have to change the user API to `DiscreteForcing` to support this, but the changes need not be major). This way one might be able to support systems of reacting tracers, as well as many ""additional"" passive tracers that are not involved in a forcing function.

For tracer advection, all that matters are the definition of the left-biased and right-biased functions for interpolating cell-averaged tracer values to cell faces.

Availability,"> I believe for your implementation, since the tracer values are not corrected for pressure, any leakage will be due to the advection of tracer by momentum that _is_ impacted by the pressure correction. This advection should be less with a smaller spacial step if I remember correctly. Well, I agree that less leakage implies that less tracer is advected across the boundary. But why is less tracer advected across the boundary?. It occurs to me that we are not converging to a particular solution as we refine the grid in this case, because this problem has no viscosity. Perhaps we should do a convergence test for a case with finite viscosity. We do introduce grid-scale gradients in the predictor velocity field via masking, so it does seem possible to me that the leakage / pressure gradient error might scale with resolution. It'd be nice to have a solid mathematical explanation for this behavior. Another question might be whether the leakage / error depends on the extent of the masked region (holding resolution constant).

Availability,"> I don't have enough knowledge to comment on the logistics of the test I think, but what I can assess looks pretty good!. Perhaps I should expand on the original post. Before this PR, we had an ""internal wave dynamics"" test which tested that the vertical propagation of an internal wave was simulated ""accurately"" (according to a more or less arbitrary tolerance). The domain is horizontally periodic and vertically bounded with one point in the y-direction; therefore the grid could be made `Flat` in the y-direction. Also, the wave has a vertical wavenumber of 16 and a horizontal wavenumber of 1, so it has a thin aspect ratio and is nearly hydrostatic. After this PR we conduct 8 tests, rather than 1 --- 4 tests for `IncompressibleModel` and 4 tests for `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`. For each model we run the tests on 4 different grids:. * y-periodic `RegularRectilinearGrid` (the original grid used in the test); * y-`Flat` `RegularRectilinearGrid`; * y-periodic `VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid` with regular spacing in `z`; * y-`Flat` `VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid` with regular spacing in `z`.

To clarify, the statement ""when U_b is negative"" means more generally ""when U_b implies inflow into the domain"". It makes sense to me that inflow is prescribed, whereas outflow is a little tricker, requiring us to smoothly advect information out of the domain. Having the boundary condition depend on the previous time-step does seem to break assumptions we have made about how information flows. For example, we call `update_state!` during model construction. How does the first time-step / initialization work with this kind of outflow model? It might help to consider that. Practically speaking it would not be hard to pass the time-step to update state. But it might be nice to understand the implications before committing, because a different design / redesign could make sense.

Availability,"> I have only used overwrite_existing=false without a checkpoint for short tests within the same Julia instance to extend the model output. Thank you for pointing out this use case. I think this is another situation that could be solved by waiting until `run!` for initialization.

Another idea by the way would be to move the concept of ""overwriting"" to `run!`, as well.

Availability,"> I hope this description of the workflow is clearer. It's clear!. > I thought the optimal implementation is to append to the previous existing file when using checkpoints. Of course I agree with this. I think our basic principle should be that there is no difference in workflow, either for running or analysis, between scripts for checkpointing or not. Also, I think that `overwrite_existing` should not delete your files if you are picking up from a checkpoint (regardless of what it is set to). Do you agree?. > If I don't change the name each time I pickup, with the overwrite_existing=false it crashes, and with overwrite_existing=true it rewrites all the files. If we have a system that does not overwrite files when picking up from a checkpoint, do you think that it will be necessary to have `overwrite_existing=false` by default? In this case, the only time we risk overwriting files is when we _re-run_ a simulation from the beginning. Assume for the following discussion that the ""overwriting issue"" is solved for checkpointing:. In my experience, I typically set up a script with `overwrite_existing=true` from the very beginning. This is because when we first write a script, we are prototyping. I have never then gone back and changed `overwrite_existing=false` because of some concern about overwriting data. It's inconvenient, in fact, to set `overwrite_existing=false`. My thought is that it makes more sense to ask people to intentionally request `overwrite_existing=false` in the _rare_ case that this is desired. The key insight is that we spend the vast majority of time prototyping. I would even argue from an economic standpoint that the productivity saved from this setting outweights any rare instances of lost data, if they actually would ever occur due to changing the default. Also, even for this purpose I don't really want a ""non-overwriting guarantee"" as a feature. I would prefer something like ""unique_filenames = true"" or something, which I could then ""turn on"" if I",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3818#issuecomment-2392162201:160,checkpoint,checkpoints,160,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3818#issuecomment-2392162201,10,['checkpoint'],"['checkpoint', 'checkpointing', 'checkpoints']"

Availability,"> I like @glwagner 's suggestions.; > ; > One question: if we remove examples can they still reside in tests of somewhere else where people can dig them up if they want to see them or will they disappear?. That's a great question, since there are really two points at stake here and there's more than one way to provide ""examples"" to users. In any case, providing ""assured"" examples required testing. That's perhaps why we're hesitant to advertise the huge amount of code in `validation` as a resource for users. It is a resource, but only if you know what you're doing, because the scripts often go stale and we don't have the mojo to test them all in CI right now. ""Examples"" are scripts that we'd like to offer to users as guaranteed-to-work pieces of code to get them started. Right now, we build all of our examples with `Documenter.jl`. This both tests that the examples work correctly, and also allows users to browse the examples in html (pretty sweet). But currently (and just because we haven't devoted time to cracking the problem) this means we have limited computational resources for examples. But another possible solution is to test examples in CI _without_ piping them through documenter. Those scripts would then be available for viewing on github (and we can link to them in the docs); it's just that we wouldn't get the pretty markdown / images / movies. If we don't use Documenter then we can run these tests like any others, and also test examples for GPU.

Availability,"> I think it would be good to have the Stokes drift profile available somewhere. So even though only the Stokes shear is used in Oceananigans, I think it is still useful to get the Stokes drift at every level and then differentiate that to get the Stokes shear. I agree! Just to makes sure we're on the same page, it seems we need two separate functions to calculate both the Stokes velocity and Stokes shear averaged over a finite volume cell:. 1. The finite-volume-averaged Stokes _shear_ is the difference between a continuous expression for the Stokes velocity evaluated at the top and bottom of a cell; 2. The finite-volume-averaged Stokes velocity is the difference between a continuous expression for the total-depth-averaged Stokes velocity at the top and bottom of a cell. > In terms of implementation the ""theory wave"" is easier -- it's essentially a function of wind speed (the integration over the empirical wave spectrum is done analytically). We just need to apply it multiple time to different depths and then differentiate that to get the layer averaged Stokes drift. For the model used in Harcourt and D'Asaro (2008) we need to do the integration over the empirical wave spectrum numerically. And in addition to wind speed, it also depends on wave age.

Availability,"> I think the e could be ""effective"" rather than ""eddy"". I'm not sure it makes sense to refer to the molecular diffusivity as ""sub-grid scale"". Shouldn't we refer to the molecular contribution to the flux as ""resolved"" physics?. I come from an engineering background, so my views might be different, but I don't remember ever seeing something called ""effective"" diffusivity. Also, to me at least it's kind of ambiguous what process go into some ""effective"" diffusivity, which I think can confuse users (I certainly would be confused). . Plus, one could argue that molecular diffusivity itself isn't technically ""resolved physics"", since we're not resolving the molecules! It's just the same down-gradient closure as the eddy diffusivity. It works really well in this case because there's a huge scale separation between the molecule size and the smallest motion size, which is the Kolmogorov scale. While this scale separation is natural for molecular diffusivity, it's completely artificial (non-existent really) for the eddies, which is why it doesn't work nearly as well. (Corrsin published a really nice paper about this in 1976.). So I still think that `ν_sgs = ν_eddy + ν_molec` makes sense and is unambiguous.

Availability,"> I think we should distinguish between output we need when we run the model, and output we may eventually provide to the broader community. Ideally, formats for both would be the same, but this may not be the best solution. E.g., netCDF has obvious disadvantages but is still widely used. That does not mean it should be the output format we use by default (although we may want to provide model statistics in netCDF in the end, if a few years from now this is still what everyone uses). So: separate the discussion of what is best for us now from what we should provide (e.g., in any CMIPx archive down the line). Zarr and HDF both seem worth discussing.; > ; > Also important to keep in mind in this discussion: Our workflow will be different from most standard models, which write out instantaneous output that then is post-processed to get statistics etc. We will have to accumulate statistics on the fly, and we can (and should) forgo most instantaneous output, at least for the atmosphere. The model will learn from the accumulated statistics. Otherwise, with instantaneous output, the data volume, especially with embedded LES, will create an I/O and data transfer bottleneck that will limit us, and, e.g., will limit our ability to use distributed computing platforms. I agree. Ideally we'd support different formats (e.g. NetCDF, JLD2, HDF, Zarr, etc.) and have the option to use the best format for your application.

Availability,"> I thought this was answered quite clearly, albeit for a very idealized case, here: https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/945#issuecomment-692706814 Is AB2 still technically only first-order accurate?. True, that PR does demonstrate convergence with time step! However we seem to rarely concern ourselves with time-stepping errors (apart from catastrophic instability), which I think is justified since spatial errors dominate in our simulations that are typically marginally-resolved in space by design. The stickier and harder question regards _time to solution_, which is what we really care about. It's stickier because it is fundamentally heuristic. For example since RK3 is a 3-stage time-stepper and AB2 is 1-stage, we need to be able to take time-steps that are 3 times longer with RK3. Theoretically, [AB2 is stable up to CFL=0.5](https://mitgcm.org/public/r2_manual/final/online_documents/node310.html) while RK3 is stable up to CFL=sqrt(3)=1.7 --- just barely achieving the ""3x"" needed for RK3 to be superior. But that's just in theory. In practice we find that solutions become unstable at lower CFL, and caution warrants a bit of buffer. It seems like we usually use CFL=0.1-0.2 for AB2 but CFL=0.5-1 for RK3. So at the lower end for AB2, RK3 is indeed providing a decent speed up for time to solution. And I agree with you @ali-ramadhan that I have found in practice that I prefer RK3 for LES. There is more to the story --- RK3 also has superior stability properties for diffusion. Where there is some interesting room for further research is also to understand how much more stable RK3 might make a turbulence closure scheme like CATKE or k-epsilon. We do find that these can impose stricter time-step restrictions than advection, especially on grids with very fine vertical resolution near the surface. RK3 also has the crucial advantage that it is self-starting. This means we can change the time-step at will (without resolving this issue I guess) and we don't need tendenc",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3738#issuecomment-2418061394:333,error,errors,333,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3738#issuecomment-2418061394,4,['error'],['errors']

This seems much better. Aren't there plenty of applications for tracking fields that aren't in `fields(model)`? For example, density, buoyancy, vorticity, speed, light availability.

It's pretty primitive and hasn't seen a whole lot of love since it was first hastily thrown together many years ago.

MITgcm did this to facilitate easy switching between a hydrostatic mode and a non-hydrostatic mode: to turn a non-hydrostatic model into a hydrostatic one, just don't compute the non-hydrostatic pressure and recompute w from the continuity equation. But we feel we can use multiple dispatch to implement a hydrostatic model in Julia. This algorithm also requires extra memory (2 pressure fields instead of just 1). So we're hoping to change the algorithm to only use 1 pressure field and get rid of this pressure decomposition. The algorithm also makes it difficult to implement tilted gravity because the hydrostatic pressure anomaly is computed as. ```; pHY′ = ∫ buoyancy_perturbation dz from z=0 down to z=-Lz; ```. where `buoyancy_perturbation = g * (αT - βS)` if you're using a linear equation of state. So now if gravity is tilted it's not just a vertical integral. I'm actually not sure how to modify the vertical integral if gravity is tilted... Seemed easier to move away from this vertical integral by not decomposing pressure then we should be able to easily add in support for tilted gravity via a `bg⃗` term in the momentum equation where `g⃗ = g⃗(x, y, z)` can be whatever the user wants.

Do you guys have any idea why that could influence the `fill_halo_bottom`?. If there's a function that can return two possible types (which is inferred to a type `Union` I think) then this might propagate downstream in the compiled code (ie two possible scenarios must be maintained; one when the returned value is `Float64`, and another with different intrinsics for when the returned value is `Int`).

If you're mostly interested in the oceanic boundary layer and don't need topography or a free surface, then Oceananigans probably has most of what you need. (See #443 if you're interested in surface physics.). 8192×3072×256 ~ 10¹⁰ grid points is out of our reach for the moment although our plan is to be able to run these super large simulations one day!. We're still limited to 1 GPU (with 16 or 32GB RAM) which lets us go up to ~5×10⁷ grid point. We could probably extend that to ~10⁸ grid points if we implement #98 but even then it would take 50-100 GPUs to reach 10¹⁰ grid points. We've mostly been running oceanic mixed layer simulations with a focus on vertical mixing so no need for a ton of horizontal resolution, but we do have horizontal mixing problems in mind at which point we'll need to start running on multiple GPUs with MPI. This is something we're starting to get serious about as we do need it ourselves. Not sure how coarse you can go but if you can go down to ~10⁸ grid points then maybe Oceananigans can be useful. If the factor of ~2 reduction in memory usage from #98 would be useful for you, let us know and we can look into implementing it. In general, I think we're happy to work together on features that you might need.

Availability,"> So it seems that our model has an extra degree of freedom that neither Lilly nor Pressel propose. Quite! Though Lilly admits that his model amounts to ""little more than a scaling argument"" and that both `Pr_t` and the model ""constant"" are themselves unknown functions. So I actually think there is room to interpret Lilly as proposing a whole family of models. Since time is finite only one has been tested I guess (and also the structure of the model is questionable, so people have moved on to other formulations...). > I propose we either get rid of `C_b` and just use `1/Pr_t` or make it clear in the docs and docstring that we offer an extra degree of freedom, but that the model as proposed has `C_b=1/Pr_t`. I'm not sure which one is best since I do like the idea of Oceananigans allowing for easy (customization), but also that favors mistakes by un-attentive users (such as myself haha). Does the default `Cb = 1/Pr` both retain flexibility and also reduce the chances of unexpected behavior / mistakes?. If we get rid of `Cb` then we may want to introduce an alternative way to eliminate the buoyancy correction entirely (currently achievable with `Cb=0`). A further caveat is that using `1/Pr` only applies if `Pr` is the same for all tracers and if a linear equation of state links tracers to buoyancy. With nonlinear equations of state it's unclear what to use for `Cb`. I believe we also allow a different `Pr` for every tracer. In this case the default `Cb=1/Pr` will throw an error (probably a good thing, since you'd have to decide what to use for `Cb` in this case).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1908#issuecomment-889333799:1494,error,error,1494,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1908#issuecomment-889333799,2,['error'],['error']

Availability,"> Sorry I meant that we can now initialize field tuples (VelocityFields, TracerFields, etc.) with non-zero data. I updated the title. This change was important because it's required for checkpointing/restoring large model (implemented in #628). The field tuple constructors are further generalized in #631. Sounds good. Just for the record, `model.velocities` is just a named tuple, so if individual fields can be manually built with pre-allocated data, then so can the named tuples that hold velocity field data and tracer data. I suppose the change here is a function that achieves the same. If the current changes make the checkpointer code clearer, than I am for it. > fill_halo_regions! assumes field.data has a certain size consistent with the size of the grid. Let's be specific here. `fill_halo_regions!` does not assume anything about the ""size"" of data. Specifically, it invokes `getindex` on the property `parent` of `.data` at certain indices. Therefore such a method call must work for `.data`. In the case that `.data` is either a plain `Array` or a `CuArray`, we *know* from the properties of those types when such a `getindex` call for certain indicies will fail. Therefore, we should feel free to intercept such an error during `Field` construction. In other cases we cannot be sure that such a method will fail because we don't know how `getindex` works on `.parent` for arbitrary types.

We are trying to do simulations, not have uber fancy flexible field abstractions (this is just an auxiliary feature that's very nice).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3628#issuecomment-2179186646:152,error,error,152,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3628#issuecomment-2179186646,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"> Sounds like the plan is to switch to SolutionBoundaryConditions but that might involve more refactoring so maybe best left for another PR?. This is already done, because the model constructor calls the function `ModelBoundaryConditions` here:. https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/e41711f6b5db492d3aa5344d2e3bc9c2fe65dd70/src/models.jl#L64. which then dispatches based on whether the argument `boundary_conditions` is a `SolutionBoundaryConditions` or a `ModelBoundaryConditions`:. https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/e41711f6b5db492d3aa5344d2e3bc9c2fe65dd70/src/boundary_conditions.jl#L254. Thus in either case the model is constructed with a `ModelBoundaryConditions`. Edit: note that this is required for correct checkpointing, because the checkpointer passes a `ModelBoundaryConditions` to the model constructor, while we expect users to pass a `SolutionBoundaryConditions`. . The downside to this pattern is that the type of `model.boundary_conditions` will often be different than the keyword argument `boundary_conditions`. Hopefully this is not confusing or surprising... :-/ An alternative is perhaps to specifically delineate between them; ie change the keyword argument in the `Model` constructor to `solution_boundary_conditions`. However, something to consider is that the `tendency` and `pressure` fields of `ModelBoundaryConditions` should be uniquely determined by `SolutionBoundaryConditions`. Another factor to consider is that the pattern that keyword arguments correspond to fields is not a guaranteed julia pattern, it is simply an organizational principle that we feel is helpful. Thus I think we can break it occasionally if it improves the readability and simplicity of code. We should note the difference in the documentation to the `Model` constructor.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/405#issuecomment-531491747:757,checkpoint,checkpointing,757,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/405#issuecomment-531491747,3,"['checkpoint', 'down']","['checkpointer', 'checkpointing', 'downside']"

If we need `(4:8, 4:8, 1:1)`, then we are looking for the indices of the underlying _view_ --- but not the indices of the Field. Because, the indices of `eta` are definitely `(4:8, 4:8, 4:5)`. That's the whole point of the windowed fields abstraction is to be able to properly locate a field in the 3D index space. `eta` is the free surface, so it's indices are at the top of the domain. That's likely the case, since it seems that we are accessing the indexes of the __view__. For example, doing `eta.indices` I get `(Colon(), Colon(), 5:5)`. However, the only way I manage to make work `Field(eta, indices = indices)` is using `indices = (4:8,4:8,-2)`. I think the reason it only works by pass a `-2` (`z` index) results from the fact that the view uses `-2+3`, where 3 is the size of the halo.

I agree with this point, but I feel like I'm also missing something here. Let's say we change the pressure correction so that it works for machine epsilon. Won't the pressure gradient force still depend on `Δt`? That is, won't it be larger for small `Δt`s and vice-versa? If so, this implies the pressure gradient doesn't converge with `Δt` and if so, how do we close a budget where the pressure term is important? (Maybe that's a question for another place also...

Availability,"> Update: I used the formulas in the paper to approximate the gradient of pressure. In a test case that is pressure dominated, I found that the accuracy imporoved by more than what the theory predicted (> 16), but that is very encouraging that we are doing something right. Note that ""4th-order"" refers to the rate of convergence of the scheme as the grid spacing is reduced. For a particular resolution (and assuming that you are in the ""asymptotic regime of convergence""), the improvement gained from higher-order scheme involves both the rate of convergence / slope of the error estimate as well as a constant (the intercept) that's specific to the problem. As a result, you usually don't have a theoretical prediction for improvement at fixed resolution, I don't think (though I suppose you might be able to generate an estimate if you are differentiating a function with easily knowable properties). Empirically we usually find that higher-order schemes reduce the constant by quite a bit! Which is good --- since we often run marginally resolved problems, improving the constant (rather than the slope/rate of convergence) turns out to be the most important benefit of a high-order scheme. The plot is super busy, but the point is hopefully illustrated: higher-order advection schemes not only converge _more quickly_ to the exact solution as resolution is increased (eg, the slopes of the lines are steeper) but _also_ have reduced error at a _fixed_ resolution (eg, the error is less for WENO5 than CenteredSecondOrder at the fixed resolution 2^7):. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/101667154-fba01600-3a1c-11eb-824e-f3ec82367229.png)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1266#issuecomment-741942088:576,error,error,576,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1266#issuecomment-741942088,3,['error'],['error']
Availability,"> Using a discretized version of the thermal wind balance is a sound suggestion, but it does not explain why the error only appears when evolving the total fields. Why not? When evolving the total fields, the condition of geostrophic balance is computed during the prognostic evolution of the total variables. When evolving just the perturbation, the algorithm for mean-perturbaiton decomposition _assumes_ that the mean fields are balanced. There is no need to worry about the tiny difference between discrete and continuous balance in the case that you only evolve perturbations. But if you want to evolve the geostrophically balanced state, you must ensure that it is perfectly balanced to within machine precision, or you will have an adjustment.

Availability,"> We could procede in a couple of ways from here:. Let me provide a few other options:. * Compute the 2D boolean masks for reduced operations in `x`, `y`, and `z` when forming `ImmersedBoundaryGrid`. Then, use those masks for conditional differencing of reduced fields, rather than calling `immersed_inactive_node`. * For `GridFittedBottom` and `PartialCellBottom`, as a stop gap, define these methods:. ```julia; @inline conditional_δx_f(ℓy, ℓz, i, j, k, ibg::GFBIBG, δx, r::ZIRF, args...) = ifelse(immersed_inactive_node(i, j, ibg.Nz, ibg, c, ℓy, ℓz) |; immersed_inactive_node(i-1, j, ibg.Nz, ibg, c, ℓy, ℓz),; zero(ibg),; δx(i, j, k, ibg.underlying_grid, r, args...)). ```. That use a condition based on whether `k == Nz` is immersed. This will fix fields that are reduced in `z` without increasing memory storage or doing a computation in the immersed boundary grid constructor. And that's the most common case anyways. * When building a `ReducedField`, compute the mask that has to be applied to abstract operations. Then, extend the `_derivative` constructor for the combination of a `ReducedField` argument + `ImmersedBoundaryGrid` using conditional operation. This has the advantage of avoiding the mask computation in `ImmersedBoundaryGrid` (since its only needed to do operations on reduced fields). The disadvantage is that different reduced fields have to redo the computation. Also, this only fixes abstract operations and does not fix the internal operators. We also have to update the conditional operators to throw away the immersed boundary grid for reduced fields, or throw away the immersed boundary grid inside the abstract operation. * A variant on the above approach is to compute the mask when forming `Derivative`. But then a new mask is computed for every operation. There's probably a lot of other options.

I thought the problem was with `Bounded`, not `Periodic`. The issue is when the velocity field + time-step is so high that multiple reflections across the entirety of a bounded direction occur in a single time-step. We don't model that situation. We can only handle a single reflection. The particles should not move in `Bounded` directions as there is no v-velocity (and no way to produce one because of no Coriolis, no viscosity, and no friction at the boundaries). Particles should move only along the x-direction where they move out-of-bounds because `CFL=10` and the particle shoots out of the domain. Shear instability should not happen because there is no viscosity/coriolis/buoyancy. In my opinion the unexpected behavior (to be corrected) is to find a NaN or a reflection. @Yixiao-Zhang can you try running on CPU with `--check-bounds=yes` or on GPU with `-g2 --check-bounds=yes` you should get more information about the issue.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3320#issuecomment-1772995167:59,error,error,59,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3320#issuecomment-1772995167,1,['error'],['error']

I guess with this default, `closure=IsotropicDiffusivity()` is equivalent to `closure = nothing`. Note we _can_ run ""inviscid"" simulations. They don't always blow up if the time-step is small enough (even when the advection scheme conserved variances...) For example some of the work over at https://github.com/CliMA/GeophysicalDissipation.jl. We could just use 0 default for kappa and require nu. This is convenient for simulations with no tracers that don't need kappa.

Availability,"> note that our input is the Stokes shear, so I think the most convenient thing to have is the Stokes drift at every level. We can difference that between the top and bottom of a cell to get the ""finite volume averaged Stokes shear"". What do you think about that?. I think it would be good to have the Stokes drift profile available somewhere. So even though only the Stokes shear is used in Oceananigans, I think it is still useful to get the Stokes drift at every level and then differentiate that to get the Stokes shear. >Perhaps it makes sense to start with the Harcourt and D'Asaro 2008 model then? I'll look into that and document what I find here... In terms of implementation the ""theory wave"" is easier -- it's essentially a function of wind speed (the integration over the empirical wave spectrum is done analytically). We just need to apply it multiple time to different depths and then differentiate that to get the layer averaged Stokes drift. For the model used in Harcourt and D'Asaro (2008) we need to do the integration over the empirical wave spectrum numerically. And in addition to wind speed, it also depends on wave age. So I would probably start from the ""theory wave"". I guess it should be straightforward to convert [the Fortran function in GOTM](https://github.com/gotm-model/code/blob/master/src/stokes_drift/stokes_drift_theory.F90) to Julia? . In terms of the resulting Stokes drift profile, ""theory wave"" usually gives a weaker Stokes shear under the same wind. The Donelan et al. (1985) spectrum used in Harcourt and D'Asaro (2008) is for pure wind-wave and gives a strong Stokes shear especially very close to the surface. . I have never used ""theory wave"" to drive an LES. But if we want to approximate the Stokes drift under a wide range of wave conditions with both wind waves and swell, I guess it might not be a bad option at least in an averaged sense?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2290#issuecomment-1055347882:323,avail,available,323,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2290#issuecomment-1055347882,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"@ali-ramadhan @christophernhill it looks like the incompressible-in-time tests are failing for a hyperbolically `VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid`. However, a curious aspect of the test is that we compare `maximum(|δ|)` to 0, where `δ` is the divergence. Models that use `VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid` fail this test because `maximum(|δ|)` is greater than 5e-8 (its around 1e-4 for AdamsBashforth, and 3e-5 for RK3). . However, it looks like `sum(δ)` is smaller than machine precision; thus mass does not accumulate in time. . The larger-than-normal error only shows up when the grid is stretched; when the coordinate spacing in `VerticallyStretchedRectilinearGrid` is constant, the tests pass. Should we modify this test?

Availability,"@francispoulin I do not know but I think it would be good to find out. `VerticallyImplicitTimeDiscretization`, despite being verbose, is actually too terse --- what we are really implementing is a _backwards_ vertically implicit time discretization. Our implementation in `QuasiAdamsBashforth2` is a first-order backwards approximation. Note that `QuasiAdamsBashforth2` is also first-order for explicit stepping, so this implementation should not change the accuracy of the scheme, I don't think. In `RungeKutta3` we implement a scheme that is backwards ""within stages"". This corresponds to some particular choice of Butcher tableau and I am not sure if it is formally 3rd order still. We might be able to develop a convergence test to an analytical solution to investigate this problem. It needs to be relatively high spatial resolution so that time-stepping errors are larger than spatial discretization errors.

Availability,"@francispoulin sounds like a good plan! Then we can see how to proceed. Concerning the way forward with `WENOVectorInvariant`, it seems that it is very diffusive when compared to standard WENO. an example on a 256^2 periodic Bickley jet below, contours are of vertical vorticity (left) and zonal velocity (right).

These weights are 3 constant parameters, which are quite empirical and ""free-to-choose"" (in our case just `1/10` for the downstream, `6/10` for the central and `3/10` for the upstream stencil). Dissipation can be reduced by increasing the ""central stencil weight"". The idea with @sandreza was to perform an easy calibration to try to ""reasonably"" preserve enstrophy in the Bickley jet (then maybe calibrate it also against the spherical bicklet jet or R-H waves where also Coriolis is involved). The objective is to completely eliminate explicit viscous dissipation in the horizontal direction (harmonic and/or biharmonic) for the global simulation",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2317#issuecomment-1063249741:1138,down,downstream,1138,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2317#issuecomment-1063249741,1,['down'],['downstream']
Availability,"@francispoulin, sure, I'd like to discuss the implementation of advection in the `ShallowWaterModel`. We can also zoom if you want, send me an email and we can see when we both have time. @christophernhill I'll take a look at that! It will be nice when implementing the cubed sphere. @pvthinker thanks for the comment! In this case vorticity is still the quantity being upwinded. I agree that upwinding the velocity would lead to errors since you have to ensure consistency in `div(U)` which you break by using an upwinding stencil for U (at least on a C-grid). ; Here I just relied on U to assess the ""smoothness"" of the vorticity stencils for upwinding. (if we look it in an ENO fashion, the choice of wether to upwind strongly or use a (less dissipative) centered stencil for vorticity relies on the velocity field rather than the vorticity field). . This might also be consistent with how you choose the stencils in the advection of tracers, where the choice is based on the evolved quantity (I have no mathematical proof in this case). I agree though, that maybe some more quantitative study is required to ensure that this method plays nicely. Just to share, these are the spectra (KE and enstrophy) at the final time step of the _immersed_ simulation shown above compared with a 2nd oder vector invariant (ensthrophy conserving) scheme with additional biharmonic viscosity (at a resolution of 1024^2) ; ![vel_x_spec-bih](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33547697/160655542-18b59170-a928-44ac-85f4-60b22b8e8dce.png)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2317#issuecomment-1082056720:430,error,errors,430,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2317#issuecomment-1082056720,1,['error'],['errors']

If I understand correctly, the WENO5 scheme calculates the advection with different advection schemes (all of which are correct regardless of the grid) and then does a weighted sum of these solutions according so some criterion. So the issue with WENO5 and StretchedGrids is not that the advection calculated is ""wrong"", it's just that the weighting of the solutions is done in a non-optimal manner, and therefore introduces errors that could be avoided, right?.

Availability,@glwagner The goal of shifting the system is to recover a positive definite matrix by adding \lambda to all eigenvalue of the problem.; The proposition of @Yixiao-Zhang is to do that by adding v_0 * v_0^T. `v_0 * v_0^T` is ONLY semi-positive definite so not all eigenvalues will be modified. But it should lead to a positive definite A + c * v_0 * v_0^T (rank-one updating) by only updating one eigenvalue (the 0 eigenvalue).

Availability,"@glwagner and I talked yesterday and here are some points that emerged (@glwagner feel free to chime in if I'm forgetting/misrepresenting something). We agreed that the important points in this PR are two. (1) We should export all directions/formulations (`ZDirection`, `XYDirections`, `ThreeDimensional` or whatever we end up calling them) at the top level, and (2) we shouldn't reintroduce a `Vertical` direction in `TurbulenceClosures` when there already exists a `ZDirection` defined in `Grids` that's used for buoyancy purposes. However, we need to agree on a notation. A few main options emerged from our talk:. ### Option 1. First option is we keep calling the directions `Vertical` and `Horizontal`, since those names are pretty intuitive and play well with already-defined terms like `VerticallyImplicit` (which are also intuitive and widely used in the literature). The downside to this option, if we were to follow (2), appears as an inconsistency whenever we tilt the domain and need to use `buoyancy = Buoyancy(model=BuoyancyTracer(), vertical_unit_vector=ĝ)` (`ĝ` being a unit vector). So we could end up with a case where the vertical direction is implicitly defined as being tilted 45 degrees (by means of `Buoyancy`), but for `ScalarDiffusivity` `Vertical` will still mean the `z` direction, which is confusing. Furthermore, the default option for buoyancy would be called `buoyancy = Buoyancy(model=BuoyancyTracer(), vertical_unit_vector=Vertical())`, which is not helpful. ### Option 2. Second option is to change the notation to what I proposed here: `XYDirection` etc., which avoids this inconsistency. The downside is that it doesn't play well with terms like `VerticallyImplicit` anymore.

Availability,"@glwagner yes, that was more along the lines of what I was saying. From the docs it seemed to me using a Gaussian mask in the relaxation should be equivalent to a sponge layer, which is why I expected the gaussian function to be set-up with a sharp cut-off. But I think we're on the same page about what a sponge layer should be. . So I think it may be a matter of maybe making the docs clearer? Maybe also, like you said, constructing an example that uses sponge layers (I think there's an issue about there somewhere, right?). The Langmuir example might a good one.

Availability,"@hennyg888 thanks posting this. a few thoughts - . I assume what @hennyg888 is running is based on this https://github.com/christophernhill/onan-jcon2021-bits/blob/main/run/satori/run-on-bench-on-rhel7-satori-with-mpi ? . There are quite a few things to double (triple) check. 1. **are you running on multiple GPUs?** ; There is some obscure foo for that here ( https://github.com/christophernhill/ImplicitGlobalGrid.jl/blob/5e4fd0698b7087467d9314bfa253d6bc9a09a40a/diffusion3D_multigpu_CuArrays_novis.jl#L21 ) that is not in Oceananigans or ImplicitGlobal as downloaded. Its not really particularly documented anywhere either (except in a blog post for this https://github.com/NVIDIA-developer-blog/code-samples/blob/master/posts/cuda-aware-mpi-example/src/CUDA_Aware_MPI.c as far as I can tell)! Without this bit you may end up running all ranks on the same GPU. The blog post here https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/benchmarking-cuda-aware-mpi/ gives a bit of background. . 2. **is there anything else running on the node when you test?** ; When I looked earlier in the week satori had become annoyingly busy. You need to request an exclusive node - and then wait unfortunately because of every else using. If you skip asking for exclusive you may end up sharing node - which is OK for getting work done, but confusing for benchmarking. . 3. **as @vchuravy mentions you may or may not be using messaging that goes direct GPU to GPU?** ; There is an issue with recent CUDA.jl that makes that hard (possibly not even possible). We are working to resolve that. @vchuravy has a suggested fix, but I found that caused other problems. The ImplicitGlobal team found @vchuravy fix to work, but with a very recent version of CUDA.jl where I think it isn't supposed to work - so they may have been mistaken. I was planning to look at this a bit more after having coffee with a Nvidia colleague who is involved in all this tomorrow. .

I'm not the best person to talk on how we should implement it in Oceananigans in terms of using z-coordinate as different levels, but it seems like a great and innovative idea. . Perhaps I'm asking a silly question but it's not clear to me that the equations I've written up (and I'll double check this with someone else too) seems to consider varying bathymetry, and I'm not sure if Oceananigans explicitly models bathymetry by adding a pressure gradient, and whether we would be double counting the effects of bathymetry using the equations I shared above.

Availability,"@johncmarshall54 agreed, that's a challenge we have to confront. If we implement immersed boundaries using the ""continuous forcing technique"", then a boundary may be defined essentially by a masking function of `(x, y, z)` (it is also possible for it to be a function of time). In this case, we might be able to ""label"" each boundary / masking function with a name or number. The boundary condition objects we then give to fields would have to define a condition to be applied both at the boundaries of the numerical grid (which we currently support), as well as any immersed boundaries, where immersed boundaries are referenced by name or number. By the way, if we use a continuous forcing technique, we do not have to change the pressure solver. This is a major simplification. Recent work suggests there is no disadvantage in terms of accuracy in using the continuous forcing technique over discrete forcing techniques (which I think is the category the MITgcm solver falls under). I'm not sure if this is too good to believe or not --- we should discuss and take a deeper look at the literature.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/721#issuecomment-605461456:191,mask,masking,191,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/721#issuecomment-605461456,2,['mask'],['masking']

Availability,"@miguelraz my two cents are that I think this is certainly feasible. I think the first step is to write up some kind of document (can you use latex?) that outlines the problem(s) you would like to solve. This is the biggest barrier. The spin-down problem is probably the simplest. I think thermal wind should also be possible, but I would use a simpler profile than in #179 with sines and cosines rather than Gaussians. . Another fun problem would be the propagation of an internal wave (or some shape), which is simpler than baroclinic instability (which requires you to solve an eigenvalue problem for some assumed initial condition --- because our domain is periodic, this may be slightly non-trivial). The most difficult problem suggested in this post is probably the saturated Rayleigh-Benard solutions.

Availability,"@navidcy Thanks for the feedback. I added a docstring for `aligned_time_step` that explains its purpose:. ```; aligned_time_step(sim). Returns a time step Δt that is aligned with the output writer schedules and stop time of the simulation `sim`.; The purpose of aligning the time step is to ensure simulations do not time step beyond the `sim.stop_time` and; to ensure that output is written at the exact time specified by the output writer schedules.; ```. ---. > 1. Why does `aligned_time_step(sim)` return a negative time-step? Is this a bug? ; > 2. Why is this fix temporary? What would a more permanent fix look like?; > ; > It seems that aligning the time-step is causing a host of issues. Is this the real problem? Should we stop aligning time-steps until we are sure that we can do it safely?. @glwagner Sorry I thought I explained the issue in #1280 but looks like I didn't. The problem has to do with checkpointing and pickup when output writers are using `TimeInterval` schedules. Output writer schedules are not checkpointed so when you pickup a simulations that includes output writers with `TimeInterval` schedules, the `model.clock` is restored but the `schedule.previous_actuation_time` is 0 for all `TimeInterval` schedules. So `aligned_time_step` thinks it needs to take a negative time step as it needs to write output at t = `schedule.time_interval`. The permanent fix is to checkpoint and pickup schedules (properly fixing #1280) which would prevent `aligned_time_step` from returning negative time steps. I see this as more of a checkpointing issue than a time step alignment issue.

Availability,"@navidcy if halos are too small then the code often NaNs or seg faults. The issue here is that we auto adjust halos in the model constructor:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/ebd7858000c78f7b1754112a68c587e6195e620b/src/Models/IncompressibleModels/incompressible_model.jl#L111-L112. this means that with a higher-order advection scheme, `model.grid` ends up being different from what the user passes into the constructor. This is a usability issue, because it means that `VelocityFields(arch, grid)` built before the `model` is wrong for the default grid in common scenarios with high-order advection. Thus if users want to build `VelocityFields(arch, grid)` before building a `model`, they need to know about halos. We think this is undesirable. Neatly summed the issue is mainly that we probably can't rely exclusively on the model constructor to infer halo sizes, because the grid is a crucial object that often needs to have correct halo sizes before the model is constructed. Thus we need another solution to this usability issue.

Availability,"@navidcy it shouldn't impact developer workflow too much. When going over the test structure with @glwagner on Tues. I suggested the following restructuring:. * Break-out ""quick"" unit-tests to be run by github actions under a single configuration (ex: linux, julia 1.6) and be able to run them in parallel. We have a ""Team"" account donated by Github so we can have tons of concurrent GitHub actions so this is beneficial if you can take advantage (might be limited by compilation costs). These tests will be run for every PR push and fast fail on error.; * `bors try` trigger a more expensive CI job to be submitted to the cluster, allowing for GPU / MPI tests. The logic here is that if the cpu tests are not working then the GPU tests almost certainly won't so you can get away with executing them less often. We have a daemon running on the cluster that synchronizes the jobs from buildkite with the local slurm controller, so every step in the buildkite config is submitted as a separate slurm job and canceling buildkite jobs kills them with slum. What is nice about that setup is you can tailor the resources used for each buildkite step just as you would slurm (ex. ""gres:1"" for 1 gpu). You can run jobs on multiple ranks, multiple GPU's, different resource limits, timeouts, etc. basically anything you can pass through to as a cli argument to a slurm batch job is supported. Also it's running on a cluster so obviously your job parallelism is very good.; * `bors r+` trigger merging the PR into `main` branch. This serializes the commits to `main` (and roll-up concurrent PR's to be submitted) so that all merge commits will pass the tests. This is an opportunity to also maybe run more expensive tests (it's easy in buildkite to conditionally run steps if running on `staging` branch) because you'll probably only run the staging CI step one or at most a few times at the very end,. the general strategy is to tier the tests so that they get progressively more expensive and to maximize ci-p",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906541778:547,error,error,547,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1962#issuecomment-906541778,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"@simone-silvestri discussed the pros and cons of implementing this ""single process version"" of `MultiRegion`. ### Cons. The main con is the difficulty in maintaining code for `MultiRegionGrid` and `MultiRegionObject`, plus `apply_regionally!`. The difficulties we face here are identical to the issues that have plagued our maintenance of `CubedSphereGrid`: the need to redispatch and `apply_regionally!` a huge number of methods on `MultiRegionGrid` creates extensive cross dependencies between ""local"" implementations and their multi-region versions. This is unbelievably annoying to maintain when refactoring or adding features to existing local implementations. We can mitigate the above issue with (i) clever and careful code design and (ii) potentially a bit of metaprogramming, similar to how `@kernel` and `adapt(to, obj)` achieve CPU/GPU polymorphism. ### Pros. We identified 3 main pros:. 1. We can run problems distributed across many GPUs, or cubed sphere problems on GPU or CPU, on a single process without an MPI dependency. This is a huge win for user experience, interactivity, and ease-of-use (users don't need to invoke `mpiexec`). 2. Related to 1, we can debug complex multiregion applications (like the cubed sphere) without MPI. This is important, given the complexity of the cubed sphere (and extensions / generalizations of the quasi-unstructured cubed sphere algorithm). 3. CUDA provides functionality that works on multi-GPU nodes: CUDA FFT, matrix algebra, etc. Being able to launch these utilities from a single Julia process may greatly simplify the implementation of GPU-distributed elliptic solvers.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2253#issuecomment-1050206426:324,mainten,maintenance,324,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2253#issuecomment-1050206426,2,['mainten'],['maintenance']

Availability,"@tomchor `ConditionalOperation` is used ""under-the-hood"" to reduce a field with a condition. A reduction on a field can now be called with two additional keyword arguments: `condition` and `mask`. Where `condition` evaluates to `false` the field to be reduced will be masked with `mask` which (if not specified) is `-Inf, Inf, 1, 0` for `maximum, minimum, prod` and `sum`, respectively, such that region where `condition = false` can be excluded from the reduction. . (probably not the right place to say it but I see now that we might have a problem with specific functions, for example `maximum(abs, field, condition = something) = Inf`. We probably should mask after the function is applied).

Availability,"@tomchor just wanted to echo @ali-ramadhan's thank you for finding that bug!. Right now Oceananigans shines for medium-size LES problems around 256^3, perhaps up to 384^3. For that application I think you may find it is as fast or faster than other codes. On that note, it'd be great to compare performance with other codes for this problem size. . For utterly massive problems like the one reported in the Sullivan paper you've posted, Oceananigans is probably not the right tool right now. We haven't experimented with multi-node parallelism yet, but as @ali-ramadhan suggests, its possible we will start working on either multi-CPU parallelism or multi-GPU parallelism soon. For reproducing the Sullivan paper, you may want multi-CPU parallelism simply because of the sheer number of nodes you'll need. It's worth noting that our AMD turbulence closure *may* be less resolution-dependent than the TKE-based closure used by NCAR LES / Sullivan (and yourself?) and thus it may be possible to run at lower resolution (potentially saving factors of 10-100 in resolution.

Availability,"@tomchor there was an interface location at which high order methods were looking ""into"" the immersed boundary. This is because the boundary treatment was the same as for regular boundaries where we always fill at least one halo. Since the value inside the immersed region is zero because of the masking, this was producing an effectively higher (lower) and lower (higher) tracer source in two consecutive cells (i.e. a spurious maximum and minimum). . This problem was difficult to find because in some way it is ""masked"" by the WENO weighting procedure:; WENO evaluates three different stencils and weights them based on their individual smoothness. Most of the times, the stencil containing the invalid cell has a very low smoothness which means that it is removed by the calculation. This might seem like a fix but it can lead to stability problems because the only stencils remaining might be the ""centered"" and ""downwind"" stencil which are inherently more unstable than the upwind stencil. The issue is immediately visible if you try to advect a constant tracer field `c=1` with high order reconstruction such as Upwind 5 or Upwind 3 (it is not immediately visible in WENO because of the above reason). . If you run this code you'll notice that the advective fluxes (which should be only 0 and 1) actually have a different value (0.96666667) at one specified location near the immersed boundary; ```; using Oceananigans; using Oceananigans.BoundaryConditions; using Oceananigans.ImmersedBoundaries; using Oceananigans.ImmersedBoundaries: mask_immersed_field!. grid = RectilinearGrid(size = (10, 10, 10), extent = (10, 10, 10), topology = (Bounded, Bounded, Bounded)).

Perhaps there are tricks we might use to help the compiler parse this kind of operation, like putting some type annotations / hints into `getindex(b::BinaryOperation, ...)`. Not sure.

Availability,"A few comments:. 1. Let's call this `materialize_biogeochemistry`. We would like to change the names of the functions to ""materialize"" as well.; 2. This should be avoided unless strictly necessary. Generally, this step introduces complexity and fragility to model setup. One source of insidious bugs is when the user-build `biogeochemistry` is different from `model.biogeochemistry`.

Availability,"After discussing with @ali-ramadhan, it seems more clear that a simple solution is just to use a default halo size of 3. For most models that use the highest order advection scheme we offer this has no effect. For models that use a lower-order advection scheme but don't change the halo size, the memory foot print of the model is ever-so-slightly larger than it needs to be. But this slightly-larger footprint probably isn't noticeable for most problems. So in summary, minimal halo sizes are a minor optimization that has little effect on most problems.

Availability,After the considerations yesterday I made the following changes:. 1. Mask the product / operation `Lϕ` so that it is 0 in immersed regions.; 2. Change the sign of `regularization` so that `regularization > 0` implies that $\tilde L$ is negative-definite. I'm no longer convinced that this PR actually makes progress on #3831. But it could be the basis for further investigation. I also think that `RegularizedPreconditioner` needs some improvement; it has a property `preconditioner` (the non-regularized preconditioner) which leads to silly constructs like `pressure_solver.conjugate_gradient_solver.preconditioner.preconditioner`.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3848#issuecomment-2422530544:69,Mask,Mask,69,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3848#issuecomment-2422530544,1,['Mask'],['Mask']

Availability,"Ah, it's true that in the continuous equations a Dirichlet condition can be specified without invoking the boundary normal. I'm not sure that holds for us though because we use the weak form of the equations. This means that all the boundary conditions boil down to specification of a `Flux`. In a sense `Value` and `Gradient` are really convenience features that _infer_ what the flux needs to be (assuming second order evaluation of the gradient across the boundary). So I think we need to know about the boundary normal for all boundary conditions... The name ""vector invariant"" is confusing but only refers to the advection of momentum, so I don't think it helps. After thinking about it a little bit I think we can implement a hack that will allow us to proceed for most cases. I think we can prescribe a priori a zero component of the boundary normal component of the viscous momentum flux. This will allow users to specify drag conditions. For example, a drag condition specifies only boundary-tangential viscous fluxes, and has the form `flux = C * u | u |` for boundaries with both `y` and `z` normal vectors (where `| u |` can be correctly evaluated due to masking). To specify a no-slip condition we would also have a normal component of the viscous flux, so we'll have to get a little smarter for that case.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-849952733:258,down,down,258,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1720#issuecomment-849952733,2,"['down', 'mask']","['down', 'masking']"
Availability,"Ah, thanks for clarifying as clearly I was mistaken. I thought I needed to impose the boundary conditions on the total field, background + deviation. If that's not the case then the boundary conditions are set up correctly. I believe the next thing to try is the same set up but without `BackgroundField` and imposing the Neumann boundary conditions associated with the buoyancy frequency. If that behaves correctly, then the problem would appear to be in `BackgroundField`, as you suspect. . **Update:** ; I made the following changes,. - Removed the background field from model,; - Added `N^2 * (z + D)` into the initial conditiosn of the buoyancy,; - Imposed `buoyancy_gradient_bc` at the top and bottom of the domain. Unfortunately, the same problems occur at the boundary. . This does not seem to be imposing the correct boundary conditions on a tracer field at the top and bottom. **Periodic condition:**; I did try setting the vertical direction to periodic and unfortunately that gave an error, copied below. .

Availability,"Another possibility is to get rid of `diffusivity_fields` altogether and put fields inside the closures. Then users have to write things like `AnisotropicMinimumDissipation(grid)`, and we probably also need to stop ""auto halo inflation"" (instead throwing an error). Might be worth it though. Also if we have `halo = (3, 3, 3)` by default then users will basically never have issues with grid construction / halo sizes. Putting fields inside the closures also makes `OceanLearning.jl` more complicated. For example, if we want to change the parameters of a model closure, we ""only"" have to build a new closure with the same type but different parameters. If we put fields inside the closures, we have to work a little harder to combine the existing closure fields with new closure parameters.

Availability,"Anyways, I don't quite see it but that could be the issue.

And we could set `collecting=false` and reset `wta_schedule.previous_interval_stop_time` there. The only downside is that bad things might happen if for some reason the `WindowedTimeAverage` is called in a callback (for logging or something) apart from when output is being asked for (since that would restart time averaging when not desired...).

Availability,"As @glwagner pointed out, the code is not set up to support this feature. . `ContinuousBoundaryFunction`s and `DiscreteBoundaryFunction`s are supported only for `Flux` boundary conditions at the moment, where the boundary contribution is added as an additional tendency rather than filling the halo regions. . If we want to support these more complicated BC for `Open`, `Value` and `Gradient`, we have to make sure that in all places where we use the `fill_halo_regions!` we also pass as arguments the `clock` and all the `model_fields`, which might be doable. In this case you are hitting this problem in the hydrostatic model because in the `ImplicitFreeSurfaceSolver` there is a `fill_halo_regions!` for velocities that does not pass `clock` and `model_fields`, making julia complain. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/d4bcc095be66c7b5c98a462106285a6f6d341fe1/src/Models/HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModels/implicit_free_surface.jl#L137.

Availability,"Below is a link to a paper that compares the scalability of multi-threading in Python, Julia and Chapel. . Brief Summary: They find that none of them do as well as OpenMP but give some reasons as to why. But they do find some improvements going up to 64 threads, but the effiicency in some cases go down to 20%. It seems that Python might do better on low numbers of threads but Julia does better on more. This was last year so I am sure this should probably redone. Also, I should mention I don't believe their problem is like ours but it's an example and has some pictures, so that's nice to see. https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02879767/document",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1861#issuecomment-886076610:299,down,down,299,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1861#issuecomment-886076610,1,['down'],['down']
Availability,"Below you will see two plots of the rates of convergence rusing schemes that exist in Oceananigans. . This plot uses the solution obtained from Oceananigans directly. The lower order methods produce the correct slopes but the high order methods flatten out because of truncation error. The error I is consistent with single precision accuracy. ; (The slopes in the legend are taken from the plot shown below and are not the slopes of the curves from Oceananigans.) . ![convergence_rates_oceananigans](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8239041/103024246-79841700-451d-11eb-8321-454171fa2381.png). This plot is similar but computed using my own time-stepping code but it does use `advective_tracer_flux_x`. In developing this code I was able to ensure that everything is double precision and they give the correct slopes. ![convergence_rates](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8239041/103024241-7721bd00-451d-11eb-8717-6437c7c2c577.png). **Good news:** The advection schemes in Oceananigans can produce the correct slopes, as predicted by theory. **Bad news:** Some part of Oceananigans (maybe times-stepping?) must use single precision accuracy, and that truncates the error of the method as a whole. Question: where is the bottleneck that reduces the global spatial accuracy from double to single precision?. This third figure shows the result for increased spatial resolution and we observe that the higher order methods saturate near `1e-16`, as you would expect from double precision. ![convergence_rates](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8239041/103028959-c7514d00-4526-11eb-94c6-81fb3d429882.png).

Availability,"But `Δt = clock.time - wta.previous_collection_time ` is not the simulation time-step. It's the time increment between collections. We can change the symbol to `T = clock.time - wta.previous_collection_time` to help clarify this. Moreover, do you think that a small error in `T` would cause the kind of issue that @liuchihl is seeing? It looks to me like the average is not calculated at all --- rather than having a small round-off error. . PS I updated your comment to show more of the code so that we could see explicitly the part of the code you were referring to.

For example, certain ways of writing arithmetic lead to larger round-off error than others. This doesn't mean the ""worse"" ways are a ""bug"". It's just that their error properties can be improved.

I'm worried if we don't explicitly check the topology that we might run into some edge cases where the nodes / spacings are the same but the topologies are different (these would possibly be pathological with 0 halo in a periodic / flat direction, but still good to explicitly check I think...). When comparing numeric equality for nodes, we should add `@allowscalar` as needed there. I think we should add a test that equality works as expected, as well. We should also add a test for checkpointing on stretched grids. I think its ok if we don't support a numeric equality for other grids --- we can build them up one at a time. They are specific to each grid. The main downside here is that we need to refactor our grid implementation to have a single `RectilinearGrid` (there's no reason to have different rectilinear grid types, since we can dispatch on the case that certain directions have constant spacing easily). So this code will go away when we make that change. But I think it's a useful incremental improvement for now while we still have two rectilinear grids, so I'm fine to have it go in once it's cleaned up. Because of this:. ```julia; julia> using CUDA. julia> a = rand(2); 2-element Vector{Float64}:; 0.8207604162394306; 0.3815099688071648. julia> b = CuArray(a); 2-element CuArray{Float64, 1}:; 0.8207604162394306; 0.3815099688071648. julia> CUDA.@allowscalar a == b; true; ```. I think that this will work if the checkpointed grid is deserialized onto the CPU, even though `model.grid` is on the GPU.

Furthermore, the few tests failures that we have are all something like. ```; JLD2 output writer [CPU]: Test Failed at /var/lib/buildkite-agent/builds/tartarus-1/clima/oceananigans/test/test_jld2_output_writer.jl:131; --;   | Expression: wu == zero(FT);   | Evaluated: -3.009265538105056e-35 == 0.0; ```. i.e. very small approximation errors that aren't indicative of any significant errors in the model. In other words, I think this is working well! I vote we simplify the model and get rid of the hydrostatic separation. @glwagner as you mentioned, this isn't a trivial change. If you wanna move forward with it, feel free to push to this PR or close this one and open another. I can also help if you want, just lmk what I should focus on.

Availability,"EDIT: This has nothing to do with Oceananigans.jl per se. Better pursued on LambertW.jl. I agree with https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3438#issuecomment-1904990127 . This part of the stack trace suggests that it is the `@warn` that is causing the problem. It should be possible to remove that somehow. Better would be to remove the `@warn` entirely and instead return the result along with info on the convergence. And maybe convenience interface for people who want to ignore it. That's a more robust interface for other reasons as well. I don't know anything about running on GPUs. Does `@warn` cause failure if it is anywhere in the package being compiled? or anywhere in the function being called? Or does execution have to hit the `@warn` so that io is attempted at run time?. EDIT: I missed this above:; >> Do you get a warning during CPU execution ?. > Nope. Everything seems to run pretty smoothly:. So it seems that execution does not have to hit the `@warn` for the reported failure. Also the stack trace indicates that the error happens when the macro is expanded. EDIT: so the following comment may be relevant, but perhaps not. It would be nice if there were a way to redirect io or send it to dev null or otherwise disable everywhere when running on a GPU. ```; Reason: unsupported call to an unknown function (call to jl_f__call_latest); Stacktrace:; [1] #invokelatest#2; @ ./essentials.jl:816; [2] invokelatest; @ ./essentials.jl:813; [3] macro expansion; @ ./logging.jl:381; [4] lambertw_root_finding; @ /glade/work/tomasc/.julia/packages/LambertW/tom9a/src/LambertW.jl:188; [5] lambertw_branch_zero; @ /glade/work/tomasc/.julia/packages/LambertW/tom9a/src/LambertW.jl:117; [6] _lambertw; @ /glade/work/tomasc/.julia/packages/LambertW/tom9a/src/LambertW.jl:93; [7] lambertw (repeats 2 times); @ /glade/work/tomasc/.julia/packages/LambertW/tom9a/src/LambertW.jl:73; [8] W; @ /glade/derecho/scratch/tomasc/twake4/headland_simulations/mwe.jl:9; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3438#issuecomment-1910836945:510,robust,robust,510,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3438#issuecomment-1910836945,4,"['error', 'failure', 'robust']","['error', 'failure', 'robust']"

Availability,"First, I think it would be great to have multi-order `WENO` advection, if it's not too difficult. Second, you can see an older version of the plot [here](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1648). Since then we've added first order upwinding. I haven't tried running this for a while and hope it works but I guess I should try it and find out. I should point out that this script uses `ShallowWaterModel`. It is easy enough to change it for another of the two models, but I did see some odd behaviour. For `ShallowWaterModel` we have that the error goes down to 1e-14, basically machine precision and the slopes are what we should expect. When I tried this for `NonhydrostaticModel`, I found that the error didn't get any better than 1e-11 or so. I looked into this but never figured out why. The major difference between the two models is that `ShallowWater` does no thave a pressure solve, so I suspect that might be part of the problem. In the end I decided that the latter was probably the best way to test pure advection.

Availability,"For simple cases, like @francispoulin mentioned, changing the architecture from `CPU()` to `GPU()` are often enough. Although if you wanna run simulations that are a bit more complicated, there are a few other things you might need to worry about. You can see a recent discussion about it [here](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1509). Mostly you have to define everything that is being used in the model calculations as a constant, otherwise the GPU won't know what to do with it. So for example you probably will need to change some of your lines to. ```julia; const Qo = sqrt(spl_taux(0)^2 + spl_tauy(0)^2). ## Random noise damped at top and bottom; const Hz = grid.Lz; Ξ(z) = randn() * z / Hz * (1 + z / Hz); # noise. ## Velocity initial condition: random noise scaled by the initial stress.; uᵢ(x, y, z) = abs(Qo) * 1e-3 * Ξ(z);; wᵢ(x, y, z) = abs(Qo) * 1e-6 * Ξ(z); # This was added to reduce the scale of the w profile; ```; (probably the same goes in other places too.). I recommend you first run the very simple examples that appear in the `README` document of this repo on a GPU to make sure that Oceananigans+GPU is working correctly. And then only after that you should try to change your example to a GPU one.

I still don't fully understand why this seems to affect the simulations that I pointed out but not others, but it's hard to argue against that correlation. @glwagner to prevent these round-off errors all we need to to is to ensure that `first_stage_Δt`, `second_stage_Δt` and `third_stage_Δt` add up to `Δt` in ; https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/fb2c670626e38e3bffe298c485f95625fb1d83be/src/TimeSteppers/runge_kutta_3.jl#L94-L96. correct?. If so, would it be a good idea to work backwards in the last statement and set `third_stage_Δt = Δt - first_stage_Δt - second_stage_Δt` and use locally defined `γ³` (or `ζ³`) from it? The difference would be either zero or very small by construction. ---. On a side note, while plotting this I realized that I was confused about `model.clock.last_Δt`, since I assumed it was the last Δt of the simulation (so in my MWE it would be `25` at all time steps except for maybe eventual round-off errors), but it's the Δt of the time-stepper substeps, which makes more sense but now I'm thinking maybe the name is a bit misleading and should be changed to `last_substep_Δt` or something.

Availability,"Ha, @rabernat beat me to it. I just wanted to mention that I am also available for questions and maybe clarify one more point of confusion that seems to stem from our current docs (working on improving that with @tomchor s input). . There are two parts in the NetCDF output that would make the integration with xgcm smooth: ; - Proper metadata for the dimensions (as mentioned by @rabernat above); - Output of grid metrics, which are distances, areas and cell volume of the grid. An important detail there is that each of the metrics should describe properties of the *surrounding cell*. So if you have a tracer value on the point `xT` and the cell bounds are given by a staggered coordinate `xC`, the distance (lets call it `dx`) for each `xT` point should describe the distance between the two surrounding `xC` points (and have `xC` as coordinate, so it can be matched correctly by xgcm). Currently the user has to input these manually but it might be convenient to add the [cf-attribute `cell_measures`](http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#cell-measures), which we might support in the future with a more complete support for cf-metadata (see e.g. https://github.com/xgcm/xgcm/issues/127)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1334#issuecomment-777081849:69,avail,available,69,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1334#issuecomment-777081849,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"Here are a couple of comments that come to mind when looking at your code. 1. You're using a call to `znodes(Center,grid)`, which indicates that you're using an out-of-date version of the code. I suggest you update the code to the latest version and then try again. It's good to always keep your code up-to-date (especially when posting here) because the code is always being improved upon (and in some instances some bugs get fixed which may be important to your example!). 2. That said, about this:. > Finally, in this case the z-axis is range from -15 to 0, so I can't use `const z₁ = -1*znodes(Center,grid)[1]` because if I do that, the value of z1 will change to 14.88. My code `const z₁ = -1*znodes(Center,grid)[grid.Nz]` will keep z1 equals to Closest grid center to the bottom (0.12). This isn't the best way to define $z_1$. The current statement will break if you, for example, decide to stretch the grid vertically. The more robust way to define $z_1$ is. ```julia; julia> grid = RectilinearGrid(CPU(), size=(64,64,64), extent=(π*H, π*H, H)); 64×64×64 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on CPU with 3×3×3 halo; ├── Periodic x ∈ [1.54466e-16, 47.1239) regularly spaced with Δx=0.736311; ├── Periodic y ∈ [1.54466e-16, 47.1239) regularly spaced with Δy=0.736311; └── Bounded z ∈ [-15.0, 0.0] regularly spaced with Δz=0.234375. julia> using Oceananigans.Grids: zspacing. julia> zspacing(1, 1, 1, grid, Center(), Center(), Center())/2 # Half the distance around a center point; 0.1171875; ```. This is clearer, and will give you the correct value even if you change the grid in the future. Note that in the call to `zspacing()` above, we need to specify the x, y and z positions to get the spacing, but in a `RectilinearGrid` Δz is constant in x and y so those arguments don't really matter. Also note that the code above is written for the most recent Oceananigans version (for which you'll need Julia 1.9). 3.

Availability,"Here's another concept for an API. As I understand this, the basic operations we want to support divide a 2D plane into a rectilinear grid. Based on this principle, we can support only a dimension-by-dimension specification (ie x and y are specified independently). Example use cases are:. * equal partitioning of one or both dimensions among `R` ranks; * non-uniform partitioning based on the number of grid points carried by each rank; * non-uniform partitioning based on the relative size (necessarily approximate) associated with each rank. Is there anything else we want to support?. Here's a syntax that achieves those:. ```julia; p = Partition(x=Equal()) # computation equally partitioned among available ranks, however many are available.; p = Partition(x=4) # computation equally partitioned between 4 ranks. There must be 4 available ranks; p = Partition(x=2, y=Equal()) # computational divided among 2 ranks in x, and the remaining distributed equally in y. There must be at least 2 ranks.; p = Partition(x=Equal(), y=Equal()) # somehow ""almost evenly"" divided among xy?; p = Partition(x=Relative(0.1, 0.3, 0.6)) # computational unevenly distributed among 3 ranks in x each given grids that contain 10%, 30%, 60% of the total grid points. There must be 3 ranks.; p = Partition(x=Relative(1, 3, 6)) # same as above (eg we normalize by the total amount, not requiring =1); p = Partition(x=Equal(), y=Relative(1, 3, 6)) # computation unevenly distributed in y among 3 ranks, but evenly distributed in x amoung remaining ranks. There must be at least 3 ranks.; p = Partition(x=[16, 32, 64]) # computational distributed among 3 ranks each with 16, 32, and 64 grid points total.

Regarding the state of NetCDF.jl , yes I would say I mostly stopped developing the package due to time constraints and currently shift my focus towards Zarr since this is what we are using in our current project. . My last attempt at improving the NetCDF solved many of the issues with the package https://github.com/JuliaGeo/NetCDF.jl/pull/61 but was not merged because of conflicts with other bugfix PRs. However, might be source of inspiration if someone wants to do a rewrite. . Regarding write performance, I would be very interested to see examples where NetCDF.jl performs worse than e.g. python-netcdf4, since most of the time should be spent in the same NetCDF C library. I have been using the package extensively and did not experience it to be slower than comparable packages. . I you are worried about the robustness of NetCDF.jl, you should not even look at ZarrNative.jl, since it is still very young and rather a prototype. .

Availability,"Hi @EavenW hope it wasn't too hard to get started (the documentation needs some more work, sorry about that). Not totally sure what you mean by a flux boundary condition with two components (sounds like the u and v velocity fields might be further coupled via this boundary condition?). Sounds like you're trying to impose a (time-dependent?) surface flux boundary condition which can be done a few different ways.; * If it's independent of time then [imposing a flux BC with a 2D array](https://climate-machine.github.io/Oceananigans.jl/stable/model_setup/boundary_conditions/#Creating-individual-boundary-conditions-1) is one option.; * If it's time-dependent then [imposing the flux BC as a function](https://climate-machine.github.io/Oceananigans.jl/stable/model_setup/boundary_conditions/#Specifying-boundary-conditions-with-functions-1) is probably the way to go. The function signature for boundary conditions is `f(i, j, grid, t, U, C, params)` so the boundary condition can depend on time `t`, the velocity fields `U = (u, v, w)` and any tracer quantity in `C`.; * If you can write your surface flux BC as a function of only (x, y, t) then a [`BoundaryFunction`](https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl/blob/master/src/BoundaryConditions/boundary_function.jl) can simplify the setup a little. I just realized this isn't showing up in the documentation but the docstring in the file I linked to has an example of how to use it.

Availability,"Hi @c42f thank you for chiming in! Will definitely ping you as we work on logging. I think we probably should have tackled logging much earlier. We still use `@printf` and vanilla `@info` for logging, which has been quite counter-productive haha. Definitely hoping we can reach a useful logger that can; * help developers by providing info and debug messages. Also nice in test logs.; * help users understand what the model is doing and provide a better and more responsive user experience by logging what the model is doing. This is where `@setup` and `@diagnostic` logging messages might be really nice. Although `@setup` and `@diagnostic` might be bad names as they don't imply logging? Not sure of the best solution but maybe your kwarg suggestion would help here, e.g. `@info source=""diagnostic"" msg`?. @arcavaliere seems to be developing a pretty general-purpose `ModelLogger` which hopefully we can adapt for all these uses! @arcavaliere I'm more than happy to help if you need anything.

Availability,"Hi folks. I just saw this issue. We are very glad that you're working to support interoperability btw oceananigans and xgcm! 🎉 We'd love to help however we can. Ideally you would not have to really do much here other than use CF conventions in your netCDF output and things would ""just work."" That's the beauty of standards. Unfortunately, CF conventions don't quite provide the right vocabulary to describe the curvilinear geometry of staggered grid models compactly (see https://github.com/cf-convention/discuss/issues/5). In the meantime, every modeling center seems to have their own preference for how to encode this (e.g. [comodo conventions](https://web.archive.org/web/20160417032300/http://pycomodo.forge.imag.fr/norm.html) [now offline] used by ROMS and NEMO, [S-grid](https://github.com/sgrid/sgrid), [mosaics](https://extranet.gfdl.noaa.gov/~vb/talks/grids-short.pdf) from GFDL). . With xgcm, we decided to use the Comodo conventions (rather than invent yet another new convention). In retrospect, this was maybe the wrong choice, since the pycomodo project seems to have totally disappeared. 🤦 However, if you put the [right metadata](https://xgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/grids.html#detecting-axes-from-dataset-attributes) in your attributes, xgcm should be able to figure out your grid. Whatever you do, please try your best to squeeze your data into existing standard file formats and metadata conventions. ; Don't invent something new.

Availability,"Hi, PencilArrays / PencilFFTs author here. I'd be happy to help solving this issue, and I'd also welcome any ideas that would help improve the PencilArrays interface and docs. I am not familiar with how you define your domain partition. However, from the point of view of PencilFFTs, there is one restriction, which is that the first dimension (`x`) must *not* be decomposed in physical space. This is because FFTs are first performed along this dimension (along which data is contiguous, as usual for Julia arrays). Also, to avoid potential issues, your eigenvalues should be `PencilArray` wrappers. For now, PencilArrays allows broadcasting together `PencilArray`s and regular `Array`s, but I'm thinking this is not a good idea since the behaviour is non-intuitive and can lead to precisely this kind of issue. So I'm thinking about changing the current behaviour in the future -- and improving documentation on this. Finally, when you write:. ```julia; xc = b = solver.storage[2]; ```. you probably mean `xc = solver.storage[3]` (or, equivalently, `last(solver.storage)`, as in [this example](https://jipolanco.github.io/PencilFFTs.jl/dev/generated/in-place/#Applying-plans)). `storage[2]` holds an intermediate state that has no ""physical"" meaning, since it has been overwritten by the end of a transform.

Availability,"Hmm. I believe that scalar operations are (or were) _specifically_ allowed globally in our `runtests.jl`, overriding any default. Thus `@disallowscalar` was used to disallow scalar operations for certain testing code without disallowing them globally for all subsequent tests. I don't think it matters whether or not scalar iteration is allowed by default since we are manually controlling that setting. Furthermore, I don't think removing `@disallowscalar` would cause tests to fail; rather, it means that those tests _will_ pass even if they have scalar operations (where previously they would not have passed or would have thrown an error). Instead of using `@disallowscalar` we can flip the global state; eg we can replace. ```julia; @disallowscalar statement; ```. with. ```julia; CUDA.allowscalar(false); statement; CUDA.allowscalar(true); ```.

Availability,"Hmm... I guess reductions in the time-dimension should actually return a `Field` rather than a `FieldTimeSeries`. That's different than how reductions for `Field` work, which also return `Field` but with a ""reduced location"", eg called here. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/3c95e7ee6772a2597e206ae35202500be1ef5b32/src/Fields/field.jl#L710. and defined simply as. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/3c95e7ee6772a2597e206ae35202500be1ef5b32/src/Fields/field.jl#L629-L635. So maybe there is no special challenge except writing code similar to what we have for `Field` that's specialized for the time-dimension. . Reductions over time + other dimensions might work then, if the further reduction is done over the additional dimensions after the special case is handled that converts from `FieldTimeSeries` to `Field`. `Field`s also support ""conditioning"" the operation (which mostly would probably be used to mask immersed areas). But we won't have a ""time mask"", so I think possibly that doesn't pose any particular problems. . Ok, then if we want to support reductions of `FieldTimeSeries` that _dont_ act on the time dimension, that's where we basically have to replicate everything we have for `Field` I guess. For example if you average a `FieldTimeSeries` in `x` then you get a `FieldTimeSeries` back.

Availability,"Hmm... we don't support `Flat` z right now with `ExplicitFreeSurface` because we require two grid points in the vertical velocity (one grid point at the ""bottom"", one at the ""top"" coincident with the location of the free surface). I'm not sure about `ImplicitFreeSurface`. Can you check?. We might be able to refactor the algorithm to generally support hydrostatic free surface simulations with `Flat` z. Maybe we just need to generalize the free surface tendency for `ExplicitFreeSurface`?. On a regular `RectilinearGrid`, `NonhydrostaticModel` with `Flat` z is hydrostatic and has equivalent physics (because the free surface physics are linearized in `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel`). Before generalizing anything we could add an error message to the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` constructor to point this out (and maybe link to this issue). `ShallowWaterModel` has a nonlinear free surface and thus finite ""Mach number"" (ratio between gravity wave speed and flow speed).

Availability,"Huh --- on my GPU I was getting 2x speed up for `Float32`. I'll have to check that again. The slow down has to do with the abstractions I have introduced. 30% is a huge slow down for one function, indicative of a major problem --- probably a type inference issue? . I think that once this problem is solved the code may become faster because of the disambiguation this PR lends to the innermost kernels. This problem becomes catastrophic for the closures, which make heavy use of the abstraction. So solving this problem is imperative. We can restore the performance of the default closure by simply pasting the old operators into `constant_diffusivity_closures.jl`. However, I believe the issue with type inference is solvable. .

My suggestion would be something like:. ```julia; julia> grid = RectilinearGrid(size=3, z=[0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0], topology=(Flat, Flat, Bounded)); RectilinearGrid{Float64, Flat, Flat, Bounded} on the CPU(); domain: x ∈ [1.0, 1.0], y ∈ [1.0, 1.0], z ∈ [0.0, 1.0]; topology: (Flat, Flat, Bounded); size (Nx, Ny, Nz): (1, 1, 3); halo (Hx, Hy, Hz): (0, 0, 1); z spacing: Stretched, with min=0.2, max=0.5; ```. In other words, I'd remove the flat dimensions (since that's unnecessary), and clean and align the `z` spacing statement. I'd also keep the ` topology: (Flat, Flat, Bounded)` because the line `RectilinearGrid{Float64, Flat, Flat, Bounded}` might not be very intuitive to everyone. If a shorter show is necessary in some places maybe we could create something like `short_show`?

Availability,"I add a bit of context here:. @Yixiao-Zhang is doing a non-hydrostatic simulation with an immersed boundary and he finds that the code crashes with the PCG solver. That is not necessarily connected with the PCG solver but it might be caused by simulation setup or other issues. Since the pressure solver used is experimental (from [this branch](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/glw-xk/divergence-free-immersed-velocity-field)), as a way to assess where the crashing comes from, I suggested using another method to see if the crash would also happen, which would validate or not the experimental pressure solver. @Yixiao-Zhang, optimizing GPU preconditioners is a quite difficult task as demonstrated by the preconditioners slowing down the simulation, and probably not a good use of time of trying to figure out a way to speed up these solvers that we are not sure we want to use. ; Since this simple attempt to have a simulation that runs (with another _correct_ solver) up to the crashing point does not work, I would suggest to just trying to use a (slightly non-correct) FFT pressure solver to see if the simulation still crashes.; If not, then we can assume the crashing occurs due to the PCG solver and try to catch the bug. ; This will probably be a better way to ""optimize"" the solver since we know that the PCG preconditioned with FFT is faster than these other methods.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3552#issuecomment-2052606749:744,down,down,744,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3552#issuecomment-2052606749,2,['down'],['down']

Availability,"I agree and I think that's also an issue with the ""fix"" in #3142. Eg previously the kwargs referred to immersed cells, ie `bottom=flux` means the `flux` is applied at the bottom of an immersed cell. But apparently, this was confused with the ""bottom"" of the domain... `upward` could be a good alternative. I'm worried about deciding on these conventions before we have cut cells though, which would probably become the preferred default. Whatever API we have should make sense for cut cells. . All of this is one reason why I feel it might better to remove documentation for `ImmersedBoundaryCondition` altogether and recommend using ordinary boundary conditions on immersed boundaries. I think it's straightforward to apply ordinary boundary conditions on either full cells, partial cells, or cut cells. While we do lose some convenience, that downside is balanced against requiring users to have a more detailed understanding of the problem they are trying to model, which is arguably a good thing... Confusing behavior for immersed boundaries seems to arise only when users try to exert more granular control over the boundary condition through `ImmersedBoundaryCondition`.

Availability,"I agree that `z_faces` is clearer! I just wanted to be sure we were talking about the same changes. I believe that specifying the grid with `z_faces` does indeed require knowledge of the number of grid points, because the user specification depends on the vertical _index_. The case of a uniform grid illustrates this point: `z_faces = k -> (k - 1) * Lz / (Nz + 1)` for `z = (0, Lz)`. Note that the keyword argument `z` is redundant, since it can be inferred from `z_faces` (by evaluating `z_faces(1)` and `z_faces(Nz+1)`. Thus I am not sure I agree that we should require the `z` keyword argument when `z_faces` is supplied. I think it'd be nice to have both a ""discrete"" interface that uses the `z_faces` or `z_cell_interfaces` keyword argument, as well as a ""continuous"" interface that accepts a ""mapping"" or ""stretching"" function as I described above. With a ""continuous"" interface, the interval kwarg `z` is required because it cannot be inferred from `z_stretching` or `z_map` (whichever we prefer).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1551#issuecomment-815159490:423,redundant,redundant,423,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1551#issuecomment-815159490,2,['redundant'],['redundant']
Availability,"I agree with @ali-ramadhan, keeping a `overwrite_existing` seems quite important to me too, potentially with a default value of `overwrite_existing = false`. . Another issue to add into this discussion is the fact of how to handle output (e.g. `file.nc`) with checkpoints and `file_splitting`. Currently, when a simulation is pickup from a checkpoint having the flag `overwrite_existing = true` rewrites to empty all the pre-existing files (i.e. file_part1.nc, file_partN.nc). With `overwrite_existing = false`, the simulation crashes because it doesn't find the file `file.nc`.

Availability,"I also think that we should consider also another example problem like a flow around a cylinder because the internal wave problem seems to be hard to tolerate without large damping regions which makes it quite hard to tell how well the boundary condition is doing.

Availability,"I also want to drop another optimization that can be used here --- using a `Float32` grid with the preconditioner. This will speed things up a bit.

I also suggest plotting the divergence to get a handle on how the solver is working. A well-converged solution seems to have isotropically-distributed divergence errors. With looser tolerances, the divergence may be concentrated around the bathymetry (and of course with the naive FFT solver it has a thin layer adjacent to the bathymetry). I also think it would be nice if setting `maxiter=0` had a similar effect as simply using the FFT-based preconditioner. It's not the case right now, I think because we do not apply the preconditioner to the pressure initially before doing the CG iteration.

When we do a reduction over an immersed field, we wrap the field in a `ConditionalOperation`, in this case with condition `NotImmersed((i, j, k, grid) -> true)`.; a conditional operation has a `getindex` which is defined as; ```; @inline function Base.getindex(c::ConditionalOperation, i, j, k) ; return ifelse(get_condition(c.condition, i, j, k, c.grid, c), ; c.func(getindex(c.operand, i, j, k)),; c.mask); end; ```; and in this particular case, the `mask` in `-Inf` and `get_condition` is defined as; ```; @inline function get_condition(condition::NotImmersed, i, j, k, ibg, co::ConditionalOperation, args...); LX, LY, LZ = location(co); return get_condition(condition.func, i, j, k, ibg, args...) & !(immersed_peripheral_node(i, j, k, ibg, LX(), LY(), LZ())); end ; ```; (where `condition.func` always evaluates to `true`); In practice, what is happening is that where `get_condition` evaluates to `false`, the `getindex` returns `-Inf` instead of the value. ; What worries me here, is that there is an evaluation of `immersed_peripheral_node`. This is the only difference I can notice with a non-immersed field. The fact that the error appears only with specific locations makes me believe that the evaluation of `immersed_peripheral_node` might be the source of the problem.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2744#issuecomment-1262535906:98,error,error,98,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2744#issuecomment-1262535906,5,"['error', 'mask']","['error', 'mask']"

Availability,"I decided to program the different advection schemes in Julia, without using Oceananigans. I can share the code if anyone is interested but it's nothing fancy, and needs some cleaning up. I found that the 5th order upwinding stencil, as used in Oceananigans, should have fifth order convergence. See the results below. So the good news is the stencil formula is correct. The bad news is that I don't know why we are not getting the correct values in Oceananigans, even though I am using the exact same tests. I admit that I don't understand the symmetric interpolant stuff that is done, which is perhaps why I can't see the error. Also, doing 6th order would be easy enough to do if there was interest. ```; For UpwindingFirstOrder: Rate of convergence = -0.9661593569685473 expected = 1.

Availability,"I did a few tests with some criteria for timestep-skipping with a couple of my own simulations in addition to the MWE included here. In summary:. 1. Criterion `sim.Δt / 1e10`: successfully gets rids of the problem in both the MWE and in my simulations; 2. Criterion `10 * eps(sim.Δt) * sim.Δt`: doesn't get rid of the problem in any simulation; 3. `100 * eps(sim.Δt) * sim.Δt`: fixes the problem in the MWE but not in my simulations, although it does decrease its frequency of occurrence a good amount.; 4. `1000 * eps(sim.Δt) * sim.Δt`: fixes everything in all simulations I've tried. So only options 1 and 4 fully fix the problem (at least in the simulations I've tried so far). For me both those options rely on pretty arbitrary numbers though, so I'm not very happy with neither. From the point of view seeing the timestep-skipping as an approximation ($u^{n+1} \approx u^n$), then maybe criterion 1 makes more sense, although I'm not sure how it'd behave for Float32 simulations. I see three possible ways to go about it right now:. 1. Do what this PR is doing, and manually set the criterion to either option 1 or 4 above. If it turns out that some simulations still have issues, we revisit.; 2. We add `min_Δt` as a property of `NonhydrostaticModel` (or maybe `Simulation`?). I think the minimum `Δt` for which time skipping will be necessary will vary significantly between simulations, so this solution deals with that by leaving the decision up to the user if they are interested in the pressure output.; 3. We try something that actually prevents these round-off errors instead of dealing with them. @glwagner suggested an `Integer`-based model clock, but there might be other options.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3606#issuecomment-2134109698:1574,error,errors,1574,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3606#issuecomment-2134109698,1,['error'],['errors']

Availability,"I guess `partition` would take the place of `ranks`. I think it makes sense to delay building `connectivity` (ie we only build connectivity when we build fields and their boundary conditions) --- because we can construct connectivities if we have 1) grid and 2) the partition. But we still have to store the partition in either `grid` or `grid.architecture`, correct?. One approach could produce code like. ```julia; arch = MPIArchitecture() # note no arguments; grid = RectilinearGrid(arch, grid_kw..., partition=XPartition()); ```. internally, the constructors maybe take the form. ```julia; function RectilinearGrid(arch, size, other_grid_kw, architecture_kwargs...); arch = rebuild_arch(arch; architecture_kwargs...); # etc; end; ```. That's possibility (1). Possibility (2) is to use a wrapper for MPI jobs, perhaps completely eliminating `MPIArchitecture` altogether:. ```julia; arch = CPU(); grid = RectilinearGrid(arch, kw...); grid = MultiProcessGrid(grid, partition=XPartition()); ```. Possibilty (3) is to change all the `struct` definitions for grids so they have additional information pertinent to multi-process stuff, which is set to `nothing` when unused. The downside to (2) is that it introduces yet another level of indirection, on top of both `ImmersedBoundaryGrid` and `MultiRegionGrid`.

Availability,"I see it like this: Tartarus is a shared system with very small limitations so it is quite difficult to prevent people from running on GPU 0 (I do not think we have the ability to implement a scheduler), so there is more possibility to incur in downtime due to users running on GPU 0. The Caltech cluster might be slower but is much more reliable because it has a professionally maintained slurm scheduler that prevents these types of problems. I tend to prefer having reliability over a modest speedup for these cases, but I am ok with other solutions. One solution would be to routinely kill the jobs on tartarus running on GPU 0 without warning, that would be possible only for people with access on tartarus though. I am ok following that route (I just killed a couple of jobs now 😅).

Availability,"I see the interest of creating a handler of all the outputs of the model. Is the idea to make a wrapper depending on parsing a preexisting writers i.e. `NetCDFOutputWriter`, `JLD2OutputWriter`, and `Checkpointer`. Or do you plan to make a new structure that handles all of them? . I agree that keeping a simple way to create `Checkpointer`s and `OutputWriter`s should be a priority, particularly in the case when the user needs to restart the simulation multiple times in an HPC, keeping in mind manageable file sizes, wall times, and chunks. Currently, this can be handle by the user creating unique output folders or changing the name of the output file for each resubmission of the simulation. Unfortunately, this makes more complex the processing of the output. I think the best solution with outputs and checkpoints will be to automatically append to the last output file from the previous simulation resubmission (currently not supported). I agree that the initialisation of the writer should not create a file, I find that quite confusing. I believe it will be simple to change by only executting the `initialize_nc_file!` and `initialize_jld2_file!` once the model is running, instead of two times, once the writers are initialised and in run time (`write_output!`). . Despite the implementation of this, I still see value in having a flag `overwrite_existing`, likely set up to `false` as default (I will comment in the discussion about this), and ensure that we do not change this flag on run time, since it may result in issues and data loss. . Regarding my changes in this PR, the function `is_output_splitted!` may still be useful, since it returns the last file to then append the output, necessary to handle file splitting in a general output function.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3818#issuecomment-2391694283:199,Checkpoint,Checkpointer,199,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3818#issuecomment-2391694283,4,"['Checkpoint', 'checkpoint']","['Checkpointer', 'checkpoints']"

Availability,I suspect that the problem is the grid inflation which happens in the nonhydrostatic model. You need 4 halos because it's an immersed boundary so the model inflates the grid automatically and apparently that gives out of boundaries with the advection. If you build the model from correct sized halos thus bypassing inflation the problem disappears. . I ll put a little more effort in the inflation.

Availability,"I think @tomchor is hitting on the right solution: we should separate ""output for analysis"" from ""output for checkpointing"", if possible. Typically we need output for analysis more frequently than output for checkpointing, and we don't require things like the tendency fields for analysis. This motivates creating multiple output writers that are dedicated to their specific tasks. . On the possibility of a NetCDF checkpointer: the first checkpointer design that utilized `restore_from_checkpoint` attempted to serialize as much of a model's data structures as possible. This requirement prevented us from using NetCDF and motivated using JLD2 (there are a few other data formats that can serialize, but JLD2 is fast, simple, and HDF5 compatible, which means it can be loaded from python with `h5py`). However, we now support a simpler paradigm whereby the original run script needs to be modified with `run!(simulation, pickup=true)` in order to ""pick up"" a simulation from a checkpoint. With this simpler design we require only all the prognostic fields and tendencies (for AB2) in the checkpointer file and we could in principle support NetCDF. This has the downside that it would require us to maintain more code.

There may also be a julia function for this, but I didn't find one after a cursory search. We have (unfortunately) introduced what appears to be a needless alternative to `summary` in the source code; we call this `short_show`. So we already have sizeable technical debt...

Availability,"I think that's a decent idea and also might help de-complexify some of the code associated with buoyancy models. We would have to refactor our equations of state a bit but that's not hard. The main question is what to do about `gravitational_acceleration`. Right now, `gravitational_acceleration` is a parameter of `SeawaterBuoyancy`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/da9c53ddd9e28d123b40726cfac2fad835284879/src/BuoyancyModels/seawater_buoyancy.jl#L10-L15. because if you're using `BuoyancyTracer()`, there's no gravitational acceleration parameter (since its absorbed into the definition of buoyancy). However, we could move `gravitational_acceleration` into `Buoyancy`, and then set it to `nothing` when we are using `BuoyancyTracer`. The downside of this approach is that people can then change this parameter when using `BuoyancyTracer`, even though such changes would have no dynamical effect on the model (we've tried to limit such possibility for confusion otherwise...). It could be reasonable to move `constant_temperature` and `constant_salinity` into `equation_of_state`. `SeawaterBuoyancy` is then a type union of buoyancies with either `LinearEquationOfState` or something else from `SeawaterPolynomials.jl`.

Availability,"I think that's right --- it's essentially a matter of applying the transformation `h -> h + b` (where `b` is bathymetry` in the governing equations here:. https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/physics/shallow_water_model/. ?. I think this might be achieved two ways:. 1. Add new terms to the tendencies; or; 2. Define the `AbstractOperation`. ```julia; total_depth = solution.h + bathymetry; ```. in the model constructor and add this property to `ShallowWaterModel`. Then, where appropriate in the tendency kernel functions, use `total_depth` rather than `solution.h`. I think the two appropriate places are the pressure gradient term and the mass flux term in the continuity equation. Method 2 might actually be numerically different than method 1 when using WENO advection for the mass flux (eg, we are interpolating a different function with different smoothness properties)... I'm not sure which is better (but something tells me that method 2 might be better?.

The code is already modular with few circular dependencies so I don't think splitting up the repo would be difficult from a purely typing standpoint. I think it's fine if the solvers are specific to `Field` and `AbstractGrid`.

I think we also sometimes want free-slip rather than no-slip boundary conditions on momentum. The algorithm I am thinking of would have the following components:. 1. Implement a ""mask"" that replaces `correct_immersed_tendencies!` that forcibly overwrites immersed regions to specified values in `update_state!` (this is effectively what `correct_immersed_tendencies!` does now); 2. Extend `calculate_boundary_tendency_terms!` to adjust tendencies in cells adjacent to immersed boundaries.

Availability,"I think the problem comes from the fact that you build the advection scheme _outside_ the model with `WENO(grid)` but the grid changes inside the model and this change is not recorded in the advection scheme. . What do you think about just spitting out an error then? In that way the user is forced to rebuild the grid and any error which derives from inconsistencies between model grid and preliminary grid is solved. . We can always regularize the advection scheme _inside_ the model (as I am already planning to do, and will do in #2642) and that will clear the error with advection. . The downside of inflating the grid inside the model is that we always have to make sure that _anything_ that we build outside the model is regularized when inflating the halos (functions, auxiliary fields, viscosity functions, etc). This might be a little bit unsustainable. . For this reason, I am in favour of just spitting out an error, which might be a little bit inconvenient for the user (not extremely though) but is much safer. .

A few ideas that I had for the docs example which might be controversial are. - Use Oceanostics.jl for the progress messenger and a couple of diagnostics (basically this would teach users that we can use external tools).

Availability,"I think there's still a use for `KernelComputedField`! It's more expensive to construct a calculation by nesting `ComputedField`s inside it. The difference is in the number of kernel launches: when expressing a calculation with a single kernel, the computation is computed with a single loop over all grid points. When expressing a calculation using intermediate `ComputedField`, then first we launch kernels to calculate the intermediate `ComputedField`s, and launch a final kernel to compute the quantity of interest. It can also be more memory intensive since the intermediate `ComputedField`s need to be stored. For some applications, the ""optimization"" of avoiding intermediate kernel launches / calculations may be unimportant (for example, if plenty of memory is available and computations are made very rarely). I think nesting `ComputedField`s is a nice solution that avoids having to hand-write kernels for those cases. But sometimes I do think that users want to optimize diagnostics calculations. There are also some other nice applications of `KernelComputedField`; for example I think it would be nice to make the LES eddy diffusivities into `KernelComputedField` (which are computed every tendency evaluation so performance is crucial), and perhaps some other auxiliary variables. I think it would be fun to try the compiler hack-around that I suggested in my comment above (defining multiple `identity` functions and using an internal counter to scroll through them during compilation).

I used `truth` to refer to the data that is read from a file, done [here.](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/3676a718be1160f3ea70c3cce5dd21c5f06f144a/test/regression_tests/shallow_water_bickley_jet_regression.jl#L82) . I agree that only `v` fails but that means that `v` has larger differences compared to `u` and `h`. They all have differences. . I compared the initial data that we used in this regression test with the initial data read from the regression test. I saw that we had the 0th and 20th step saved. If there are differences at the beginning, then they are not solving exactly the same problem. In both we have that v is set to 0 and u and h are set to the Bickley jet with a random perturbation on `u`. The randomness will not be the same (unless we use a seed, which we don't, but we could) however the amplitude of the perturbations are different. This suggests to me that the initial conditions are not the same, and maybe the soruce of why the regression test fails. This is why I would like to know how the initial data was generated, using what script. I do suggest we regenerate it as that might solve a lot of the problems we are having with the regression tests. Do you want me to generate a script that load the inital data and compare it? You can see the results above. The fact that h has differences of `1e-7` is due to single precison, which means they are the same. However, u is different with errors much larger then `1e-7`, so the initial data is different. Unless there is something that I'm missing here?. I saw that the data files were dated June 1st 2022.

Availability,"I would first of all do _nothing_ that's intended to support `AnisotropicBiharmonicDiffusivity`. Instead we should delete this closure in favor of `HorizontallyCurvilinearAnisotropicBiharmonicDiffusivity` (or more appropriately, simply replace the existing `AnisotropicBiharmonicDiffusivity` with `HorizontallyCurvilinearAnisotropicBiharmonicDiffusivity`). See #2113 and a few other issues referenced there. Since `HorizontallyCurvilinearAnisotropicBiharmonicDiffusivity` uses `diffusive_flux_x` (unlike `AnisotropicBiharmonicDiffusivity` --- one of its many problems), there are no spurious _fluxes_ across immersed boundaries:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/80c7064b42a47e68c90690d7ab32db187bbdf26a/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/horizontally_curvilinear_anisotropic_biharmonic_diffusivity.jl#L67. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/80c7064b42a47e68c90690d7ab32db187bbdf26a/src/ImmersedBoundaries/conditional_fluxes.jl#L48. But I think the point here is that the fluxes are calculated using ""wrong gradients"". Note that `conditional_flux_fcc` doesn't shut down fluxes within ""X"" cells of a boundary. It shuts down fluxes _across_ an immersed boundary. I think this issue is proposing to use `conditional_flux_fcc` for a _different_ purpose than what it's used for now --- to nullify fluxes for biharmonic diffusion in a buffer region around the boundary. The reason is that biharmonic fluxes are not correct on interfaces within one cell width of an immersed boundary, because they involve second order operators?.

Availability,"I would like to start working on this. Note that in terms of maintenance burden, the docs already depend extensively on plotting. So I'm not sure a plotting extension will increase CI significantly. On the contrary we can start with a minimalist approach that simply uses the examples to test the functionality in the extension. I'd like to discuss design before starting. I think the basic functionality we need is to support automatically plotting of 2D fields. Basically we want to be able to write `heatmap!(ax, c)` and have it work automatically, eg if `c` is two-dimensional, then the non-trivial dimensions are automatically detected and appropriate node values inserted. I think this should work even if the dimensions are not `Flat`, so basically we just want to take a look at `size(c)`. We can also support `lines!` and `scatter!` and `scatterlines!` for 1D fields. Is there a streamlined way to do this for all situations, or do we need to add support for each method like `heatmap!`, `contour!`, `contourf!`, etc, individually?.

Availability,"I'll wait till it's ready to review in detail, but my main high-level comment is that we need to ensure that, at the end of a time-step, both the prognostic state (horizontal velocities and tracers) and auxiliary state (pressure, vertical velocity, eddy diffusivities) are all consistent and available for output at the current model time. If we intertwine communication with the computation of the auxiliary state and tendencies, then we should _define_ the tendencies as part of the auxiliary state. This will change the semantics and logic of the time stepping loop. But I think it at least as rational as our previous organization of events. The main change is that tendencies will now be computed one ""extra"" time in a simulation (at the very last time-step, the tendencies are not needed if no further time-steps will be taken). In the vast majority of cases this extra cost is negligible because simulations run for hundreds or hundreds of thousands of time-steps. There is the slightly possibility of pessimizing the edge case of a simulation that takes one time step, which may be useful for parameter estimation. For that purpose we may want to avoid computing the ""extra"" tendency.

Availability,"I'm not sure I grasp the issue. @jagoosw it might help if you include a simple example (eg some code, and the error that gets produced) that illustrates the issue. > With indices=(:, :, :) we should be able to output any field. I agree with this. Is the problem associated with trying to ""remove halos"" from output? Does it go away when we write `with_halos=true`?. In addition to problems with `parent_index_range`, it looks like there is potentially a problem with the user API (in addition to other bugs). The `indices` keyword in the output writers is a useful convenience but doesn't generalize well to being able to slice both 3D and reduced or sliced fields. Here's what we have:. * All `Field`s have `indices`. We can define fields that are essentialy _views_ into other fields, but ""sliced"" at particular indices. We can also define abstract operations that slice a portion of the domain.; * We have output writers that can compute and output sliced fields. ; * We have an `indices` kwarg for output writers that _automagically_ will _slice every output_ along the provided indices. This is convenient, but fails to cover the case that we want to slice all 3D fields, but leave fields that are _already sliced_ untouched.

This is the basic way to implement a quadratic drag from the interface in this PR. In this case what happens under the hood is that we create 4 `ContinuousBoundaryFunction` for the relevant faces of boundary-adjacent cells (the other 2 faces are normal to the given velocity component, so receive a no-penetration boundary condition). So there could be a type instability compiling all of those (which have been notoriously fickle to compile in the past). We clearly need to hard code quadratic drag though, because for stretched grids and partial cells (and other types of immersed boundaries in the future) we have to do precompute the logarithm of the grid metrics (to use in a Monin-Obukhov-type model) in each direction independently, as well as the logarithm of the roughness. It's too much for this PR though, so I think we should just document how to specify no-slip on immersed boundaries (which appears to be performant), and add a few tests. Then in a future PR we can add a `QuadraticDrag` utility (I have a prototype for this object; others are welcome to collaborate on implementing the necessary functions to support it).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2437#issuecomment-1104673081:33,down,down,33,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2437#issuecomment-1104673081,2,['down'],['down']
Availability,"I'm sort of glad to see @glwagner is verifying the issues we first discussed last year. My 2 cents: . - Small errors in the BC eventually propagating to the whole simulation is unavoidable; this is a well mixed flow. Checking on integrated quantities, such as maintaining conserved properties or matching the expected global dissipation rate, is a more achievable and important goal. ; - Using a test case with some stronger pressure gradients along the boundary would be good as well since this induces much of the error. The circle @wenegrat suggests is the classic, but you might be able to find a more subtle case which is more relevant to your application. Perhaps turbulent flow in a wavy-wall channel?

The problem is if we try to integrate something like a radiation condition there then we actually end up with $u(1, j, k) = \int (G_u + B_u) dt$ where $B_u$ is whatever integration we're trying to do at the boundary. On bounded topology I don't think we ever want to integrate the tendency right?

Availability,"If tracer masking changes the pressure solver, it is likely a bug. The pressure solver finds the solution to the Poisson pressure equation, which is a Poisson equation with a RHS proportional to the divergence of the predictor velocity. Tracer masking should have no effect on dynamics and is purely a convenience for output (so we should probably move the masking step to output writers to avoid the unnecessary computational expense). However, there is a bug with immersed boundaries and high-order advection schemes (solved by #2603) that means the value of tracer fields in the immersed boundaries _does_ (spuriously and incorrectly) influence the outcome of a simulation. In addition to that, interpolation / reconstruction across immersed boundaries can in principle touch tracer values within immersed boundaries. However, as far as I know we do not ever reconstruct across immersed boundaries in any core routines except the experimental `IsopycnalSkewSymmetricDiffusivity`. #2477 solves this problem by implementing ""homogeneous"" operators that do not touch tracer values within the immersed boundaries (ie differences return 0, reconstruction returns values from ""active"" cells only). This PR could move tracer masking to output writing to save the computation. However, if the tracer masking affects the outcome of a simulation, then there is a deeper issue at hand (perhaps the issue that's solved by #2603?). Perhaps a more specific question is: why does removing the tracer masking step improve simulation outcomes?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2616#issuecomment-1165721683:10,mask,masking,10,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2616#issuecomment-1165721683,6,['mask'],['masking']

For example, someone might introduce a biogeochemistry model with tracer `e`, not realizing that this would prevent them from using the biogeochemistry model with CATKE.

Availability,"Instructions to adapt the code to `MultiRegion` from a Slack conversation with @simone-silvestri:. If you want to adapt your script to multiregion you have to:; - define a multiregion grid with: `grid = MultiRegionGrid(grid, partition = XPartition(n_gpus_you_want_to_use), devices = n_gpus_you_want_to_use)` . The multiregion grid supersedes the immersed boundary grid, i.e. if you are using an immersed boundary grid then `grid = MultiRegionGrid(ibg; kwargs...)` , not the other way around.; - if you are using any array for forcing or boundary condition, you have to adapt it to the multiregion paradigm as follows: `using Oceananigans.MultiRegion: multi_region_object_from_array; my_adapted_array = multi_region_object_from_array(my_array, grid)`. MultiRegion works only on single node multi GPU, so all the GPUs should be accessible from a single process in the node. You can check the number of GPUs available by logging in a node and typing nvidia-smi , if you want to split your grid on specific devices (let’s say GPU 0 and 3), you can pass `devices = (0, 3)` to the `MultiRegionGrid` constructor. There is another thing that you have to take care of: the pressure solve is performed on one GPU only so both the storage and source term (a field of complex values of the size of the full grid) reside on 1 GPU only (usually the one corresponding to the last region). This means that if your grid is 100M points, 2.98 GB will have to be reserved for the solver’s auxiliary fields; ```julia; julia> sizeof(complex(zeros(Int(100e6)))) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 * 2; 2.9802322387695312; ```; So make sure you have that space available. (When I have time I ll try to find a solution to run truly parallel pressure solvers, for both nonhydrostatic and hydrostatic models). In terms of outputs, we make use of `reconstruct_global_field` , a function used to reconstruct a global field from a `MultiRegionField` on the CPU. It is used by the output writers to spit out the full field.

Availability,"Interesting! Good find. This not the only thing to worry about regarding the entrainment diffusivity. It's effect also seems to depend on vertical resolution, and it only seems useful at low resolutions. In general, I recommend switching to CATKEVerticalDiffusivity, where we have put a lot of effort into solving those problems. I'm going to suggest a different solution that setting some maximum capping diffusivity. I think setting a maximum diffusivity could work, but that there are better solutions that more directly address the underlying issue. I think the issue here is that ""entrainment"" should not occur across low stratification regions. Thus this model for ""entrainment"" assumes the stratification is ""strong"". More generally, we are dividing the boundary layer into a convecting region and an entraining region. We identify the convecting region by `N² < 0`. However, in reality the convecting region should extend further down into regions of stable, but still weak stratification below the unstable region. The ""entraining"" layer is more properly where stratification significantly increases over the weakly stratified lower part of the convecting region. (This analysis is based on LES.) `RiBasedVerticalDiffusivity`'s formulation --- apart from being overly simple --- simply cannot cope with the complexity of real boundary layer structure because it is not truly non-local. Really addressing this issue (eg implementing a more physically accurate model of boundary layer structure) might require using a vertical integral instead of a 3D kernel. (We decided that because CATKE seems like a decent parameterization, it's not worth it to pursue those accuracy improvements). One way to fix the issue but retaining a 3D kernel is to change the way we estimate ""convecting"" and ""entraining"" regions. Those criteria are. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/94e99e1d5fb3d121a6d801a931987bb6ff59f20e/src/TurbulenceClosures/turbulence_closure_implementations/ri_based_vertical_d",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3283#issuecomment-1731439718:938,down,down,938,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/3283#issuecomment-1731439718,2,['down'],['down']

Availability,"It's because on an immersed boundary grid, reduced operations are wrapped in `ConditionalOperation` in order to mask the reduction --- and `ConditionalOperation` had a bug; namely it was missing a definition of `compute_at!` (which all the other abstract operations have, eg `BinaryOperation`). For `compute!` on a reduction to be correct, we first have to compute all of the fields that are involved in the reduction. To make this work, we call `compute_at!` on `reduction.operand`. This in turn has to trigger the computation of _any_ fields that are in the expression tree associated with `reduction.operand`. Thus all `AbstractOperations` with field operands must define `compute_at!`. The difference between `compute_at!` and `compute!` is that `compute_at!` has a ""time"" associated with it. This allows us to avoid ""recomputing"" fields --- if possible (eg, if a field is not sharing its data with another field). PS I think a better descriptor than ""Odd behavior"" would be ""Wrong behavior"". ""Odd"" is a bit too general... by the title, it's not clear that something is actually amiss!

I suspect that it won't have an effect, but it needs to be tested.; * It should be feasible to use homogeneous / boundary-aware operators _only_ for fluxes. ; * Finally, I'm going to implement an ""enforce_impenetrability!"" operator that does 3D masking and works for both non-immersed and immersed boundaries. After that, we can use `nothing` as a default boundary condition for velocities rather than `ImpenetrableBoundaryCondition` and avoid `mask_immersed_field!` during time-stepping. It seems that impenetrable is still useful for users though for ""user-defined, additional"" velocity components so we may want to keep it...; * An even further step would eliminate the need for masking boundary regions by never updating the tendency there.

Availability,"Latest thinking incorporating some of the suggestions above:. Rename `Buoyancy` to `BuoyancyTerm` (as in, the buoyancy term in the Navier-Stokes equations) with. ```julia; struct BuoyancyTerm; equation_of_state; gravitational_acceleration; vertical_unit_vector; end; ```. Then we move `constant_temperature` and `constant_salinity` to the equations of state; and as @jm-c suggested, the equation of state determines the active tracers. Additionally, we'll define a convenience function. ```julia; BuoyancyTracer(vertical_unit_vector=ZDirection()) = BuoyancyTerm(BuoyancyTracer(), nothing, vertical_unit_vector); ```. so we then have `equation_of_state=BuoyancyTracer()` when buoyancy itself is one of the tracers. If we want to be very friendly, we can also throw an error when `!isnothing(gravitational_acceleration)` but `equation_of_state isa BuoyancyTracer` to help users avoid confusion. I think this is a good change because it allows us to define a function `buoyancy(model)` that returns an `AbstractField` (potentially `ZeroField`, `AbstractOperation`, or `Field`) representing buoyancy for use in diagnostics. It reduces the number of types we need (since we won't have `SeawaterBuoyancy` anymore), and it's a bit more parsimonious with semantics (since it avoids using the word ""model"").",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2022#issuecomment-1016840612:767,error,error,767,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2022#issuecomment-1016840612,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"Let me try to reframe the problem and tell me if you agree. I think its a real issue that the output files are created when the output writers are instantiated. Because of this, we find ourselves having to write `overwrite_existing=false` when we pickup from a checkpoint, but `overwrite_existing=true` otherwise. This is a hack for sure. It's a failure of the checkpointer design --- the whole point of the design is to make checkpointing easy. We should be able to change just one line. I even think we should be able to pick up from a checkpoint with an environment variable so we don't have to change the run script at all. That would be more robust. What you're describing sounds like an additional problem of this deficiency. The fix seems straightforward. We just need to introduce the concept of output ""initialization"". Then we can delay creating the output file to `run!`. At that point we know if we are picking up from a checkpoint or not, obviously if we are picking from a checkpoint we don't want to delete any existing files. It seems like if we introduce initialization we can also handle file splitting. What do you think? If you want to help we can get started on it. I was putting it off myself because I don't have immediate needs for checkpointing but that will probably change pretty soon. Separately I don't like I also don't like `overwrite_existing` more broadly because I feel its boilerplate, which we are discussing a bit over on #3793 .",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3818#issuecomment-2391318167:261,checkpoint,checkpoint,261,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3818#issuecomment-2391318167,9,"['checkpoint', 'failure', 'robust']","['checkpoint', 'checkpointer', 'checkpointing', 'failure', 'robust']"

Availability,"Let's review what we want to support here:. 1. `user_output` is an AbstractOperation or a Reduction. Therefore it has no indices, and we can allocate only the data we need for output. Easy and supported prior to this PR.; 2. `user_output` is pre-allocated `Field` with full indices. We compute the output indices given `user_indices` and `with_halo` (this is what we supported previously), and then construct a `view(field, indices...)`. Supported prior to this PR.; 3. `user_output` is a pre-allocated `Field` with _non-default indices_. This case is tricker, because there are several possible scenarios:; - `user_output` is a view over a full field (aka `WindowedField`). In this case, we can in principle re-index at will, since we have access to the full underlying data.; - `user_output` is a ""partial field"" with data that covers only part of the grid. In this case, not all indices are valid. We don't have any infrastructure for constructing views into ""partial fields"" in the code right now. This is probably the source of the error we are seeing. I guess the simplest solution is just to ignore ""output writer indices"" for fields that have non-default indices. And this is the first solution discussed on this PR... but then we can't respect the argument `with_halos`. To respect `with_halos` it looks to me like we need more infrastructure for calculating index intersections. For example, we have to be able to deduce that a field with already-chopped halos should not have their indices ""re-chopped"". `parent_index_range` as written knows nothing about ""partial fields"" with non-standard parent indices.; It's certainly possible to support this and probably just a little careful arithmetic to get it right.

Availability,"Looks good to me. My only question is about the derivation of ``wˢ``, which results from a vertical integration of the analytical functions. Currently this integral is performed under the assumption that ``wˢ`` is zero at large depths, which I clarified in the code:; https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/06f6ac746742d08c78b3cfed0bd40f7df4392819/src/StokesDrifts.jl#L213-L215. **Is this the correct assumption here?** It effectively means that ``wˢ`` and its gradients are a maximum at the surface under a depth-decaying Stokes drift, so any horizontal convergence/divergence of Stokes drift manifests a local change in sea surface height:; https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/06f6ac746742d08c78b3cfed0bd40f7df4392819/src/StokesDrifts.jl#L248-L250. An alternative would be to set ``wˢ`` to zero at the surface, which would cause ``wˢ`` and its horizontal gradients to reach a maximum at large depths, as the occurrences of ``ûˢ(z)`` above would become ``( ûˢ(z) - ûˢ(0) )``. Essentially, horizontal convergence/divergence would manifest as downwelling/upwelling (rather than SSH changes in the current case). I feel like this approach makes sense for LES setups, but it could cause problems for simulations of the full water column where you don't want direct Stokes drift effects deep in the ocean interior.

We want to do this anyways for more convenient checkpointing so that's a good change... - We might have to think a bit about whether the `dir` for output writers should become a relative path vs absolute path (as it is now) if we do something like this.

Availability,"Mostly I am worried about scalability and sustainability in this design, or future designs. . Currently our models are fairly simple, but its challenging to place bounds on potential future complexity. For example, models in the future may require additional fields associated with closures or parameterizations, such as boundary layer depth fields, in-plume tracer concentrations and vertical momentum, precomputed mixing length fields, and perhaps other auxiliary fields associated with various prognostic / diagnostic LES models. We probably can't plan to support setting boundary conditions on every possible field via the model constructor. With our current design we have essentially special-cased turbulent diffusivities because our focus is LES, turbulent diffusivities are relatively common, and it convenient for us.

Availability,"OK, let me put my 2 cents. If we have the validations in the docs just because of the animations then we should just put the animations on YouTube or somewhere and point people there. Having the non-working versions of, e.g., `lid_cavity.jl` script in the repo and in the docs has lead many new users in the rabbit hole of figure it out. Then users feel that scripts are not working, sometimes they post an issue or ask in Slack. But who know how many other users are simply discouraged. Personally, if I download a code that includes non-working pieces of code I am very discouraged. Thus, bottom-line: I see @glwagner's point that the functionality or pipeline for maintaining healthy validations scripts (even a subset of them) then *only those* should be included in the Docs. `Sandbox`: I'm so against a `sandbox` directory! It's like keeping your trash bin in your house for ever in case there is something useful there. I used to to it all the time: I'd keep commented out code in my scripts... But I think it's a bad practice. We need to let go. The repository and the tagged versions should not include half-bake scripts and what not. I'm happy with a sandbox repository `Oceananigans.jl-sandbox` where we keep things. Or a `sandbox` branch even. Regarding this PR and what's should be kept in the Docs: I vote we keep the convergence tests in the docs and nuke the validations. I agree with the git history size issue and probably the method of including the `.png` files that @ali-ramadhan suggests would work -- I've never done it though.

Availability,"Ok I think I figured it out. The `Float64` values are coming in from functions like `depthᶜᶜᶠ` and `height_above_bottomᶜᶜᶠ`. The main issue is actually the grid coordinates not being fully `Float32`. In particular, when coordinates like `grid.zᵃᵃᶜ` are ranges the reference and step size are `Float64`:. ```julia; julia> r = range(0.0f0, 1.0f0, 16); 0.0f0:0.06666667f0:1.0f0. julia> typeof(r); StepRangeLen{Float32, Float64, Float64, Int64}; ```. You can force it to be `Float32` via:. ```julia; julia> rr = StepRangeLen{Float32, Float32, Float32, Int}(r); 0.0f0:0.06666667f0:1.0f0. julia> typeof(rr); StepRangeLen{Float32, Float32, Float32, Int64}; ```. Doing this in `grid_coordinates.jl` fixes the MWE. Curiously this behavior of `range` is not mentioned in the docs for `range` or `StepRangeLen` but is discussed on the [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/the-type-of-a-range-step-defined-as-float32-changes-to-float64/27411). Well looks like it was briefly mentioned in the `StepRangeLen` docstring in 2019. The step size being twice the precision is supposed to help with rounding errors. But maybe on the GPU it can do more harm than good?. I can see how this leads to type promotion to `Float64` but I'm not totally sure how having a `Float64` reference and step size leads to illegal memory accesses. I'm also surprised that this issue never cropped up before. On another note, I wonder if this had any impact on performance.

Availability,"Ok getting closer maybe... I think this problem is generic and cannot be solved in general for arbitrary time steps. Here's a few thoughts:. - Reading about [Kahan summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm) makes it clear that we simply cannot avoid errors if we would like to add a small floating point number (the time step) to a very large number (the model time). . - I think the issue with the time-step is whether or not we can compute the RHS of the pressure Poisson equation accurately --- which is `div(u') / Δt`, where `u' = u + Δt * Gu` is the predictor velocity and `div` is the divergence. This is interesting, because I could not figure out why we would ever find large `div(u')` with small `Δt` even in this MWE. But now I realize that because of the status of the immersed Poisson solver, the velocity along the boundary is divergent, strongly so. So, `div(u')` is large along the boundary. And when we divide by `Δt` we get something huge. The magnitude of `div(u')` also somehow seems to depend on the time step (as does the magnitude of the spurious circulation). The correct solution to this case remains at rest of course. (An aside is that this problem _could_ be avoided by separately computing the hydrostatic pressure, and then using a special horizontal gradient operators that avoid computing a hydrostatic pressure gradient across an immersed boundary. However, this would only be correct for no-flux boundary conditions on buoyancy on side walls). Anyways, apparently because of this issue with the immersed pressure solver, it seems that `div(u')` is large (because `div(u)` is large) even when `Δt = O(1e-14)`... - As a result of all of this I am confused about whether this MWE is actually reliable for debugging the issue. I guess we should expect to see problems simply when `Δt = O(eps)` because this is when `div(u') / Δt` cannot be reliably computed, I think.

Availability,"Ok, a bit better now!. The following uses some lower-level Oceananigans functions and `KernelFunctionOperation`. I suspect this is a bit more performant, but I'm not sure. The main reason is that I think our broadcasting machinery has some overhead right now, so writing `field .= op` is not all that cheap (we can fix this, but it might take some work). @iuryt if you have the chance to benchmark different solutions, it'd be interesting to hear what works best!. The main downside of this solution is that we need to understand the staggered grid to implement it. Maybe not too onerous (@simone-silvestri thinks I should give users more credit), but part of me feels like we should be able to auto-magic our way around this. The main barrier to using abstract operations here is figuring out how to implement this function with a `ConditionalOperation` (and also having `<` as a valid `BinaryOperation`, eg figuring out #2169). I also like the following because it's the first known example of `auxiliary_fields` being used. Hooray for that! Also I realized that we can just use a linear stratification which is nice.

Availability,"Ok, here's a multi-pronged strategy to address this:. 1. Rather than computing the next time step directly based on the schedules, compute the nearest _action time_ (either output or callback or the simulation is stopping). Then compute the time-step like we have been and as suggested by @tomchor for RK3, by taking the differences between the next action time and the current time.; 2. Change `TimeInterval` so that, rather than accumulating `previous_actuation_time`, we instead compute something like the `initialization_time` and `actuation_index`. Then we can compute the next actuation time with `t0 + T * (i + 1)` --- will this reduce round off error when computing the actuation time?; 3. Fix RK3 so it also uses differences to accumulate the substep times as suggested by @tomchor. We can also manually ensure that after the subtseps are complete the the clock time is in fact the current time plus the time-step.; 4. Should we also add a feature to the nonhydrostaticmodel, something like the minimum time step? If the time-step is below that minimum, then rather than doing a time-step + pressure correction, we simply advance the model clock.

Availability,"Okay, apologies. I just didn't quite understand what you meant when you said they _seem_ identical. Typically we would just write something like `T1 == T2`, which will return `true` or `false`, or equivalently something like `all(T1 .== T2)`. Another test is to use `isapprox` (also written `≈`) as in `all(T1 .≈ T2)`. Here's a bit more background on the reproducibility tests we currently have:. We have [""regression tests""](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/tree/main/test/regression_tests) that test to ensure that output from a certain simulation remains identical across PRs, including tests that involve LES closures. These tests involve ~10 time steps. We conclude that results are ""identical"" when every grid point is within `sqrt(eps(T))`, where `T` is the floating point type (eg `Float64` or `Float32`), for example:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/fc84215f76661e9f1cfb103dc18f86442cec9d89/test/regression_tests/hydrostatic_free_turbulence_regression_test.jl#L112. Many of our other tests also implicitly rely on reproducibility. I think, therefore, that we do have reproduciblity in many cases. However, it is quite possible that your case exposes some particular feature that leads to a loss of reprodicibility. I think perhaps the next step in order to make progress is to code up a ""minimal working example"" (often called an MWE), which involves relentlessly simplifying the examle until we isolate the essential complication that leads to a failure of the test. With that knowledge in hand, we can dig deeper to find the underlying cause (and hopefully fix it). Often, the process of simplying a script in order to isolate the MWE also produces some insight about the issue (and potentially about the test).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2766#issuecomment-1273675416:1479,failure,failure,1479,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2766#issuecomment-1273675416,2,['failure'],['failure']

Availability,"Our earlier [tests](https://github.com/liuchihl/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1#issuecomment-2295354459) with a simple sine function indicate that when the checkpoint interval is an integer multiple of the `AveragedTimeInterval`, the results after the checkpoint seem reasonable. However, I’ve noticed this isn't the case with the following parameter settings, for instance:. ```julia; Δt = .01 # timestep; T1 = 6Δt # first simulation stop time; T2 = 2T1 # second simulation stop time; window_nΔt = 2 # window interval: 2Δt; interval_nΔt = 2 # time average saving interval: 2Δt; stride = 1; ```; The averaged values are clearly off after the checkpoint (t>6Δt):; <img width=""587"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24c0238d-3723-435d-bca2-4b4a2be83e71"">.

Availability,"Rather than working in the complicated setting of a multiregion grid, it might be better to have a simpler context to look at the issue. Here's an MWE:. ```julia; julia> grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(3, 3, 3), x=(0, 1), y=(0, 1), z=(0, 1));. julia> c = CenterField(grid); set!(c, (x, y, z) -> randn()); 3×3×3 Field{Center, Center, Center} on RectilinearGrid on CPU; ├── grid: 3×3×3 RectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Periodic, Bounded} on CPU with 3×3×3 halo; ├── boundary conditions: FieldBoundaryConditions; │ └── west: Periodic, east: Periodic, south: Periodic, north: Periodic, bottom: ZeroFlux, top: ZeroFlux, immersed: ZeroFlux; └── data: 9×9×9 OffsetArray(::Array{Float64, 3}, -2:6, -2:6, -2:6) with eltype Float64 with indices -2:6×-2:6×-2:6; └── max=2.47269, min=-2.49748, mean=-0.0773234. julia> a = rand(3, 3, 3); b = rand(3, 3, 3);; ```. Now we can illustrate how `Field` does not behave like `Array`. This works:. ```julia; julia> view(a, :, 1, 1) .= view(b, 1, :, 1); 3-element view(::Array{Float64, 3}, :, 1, 1) with eltype Float64:; 0.23703924592859704; 0.02820508483630202; 0.7546236569353038; ```. but this does not:. ```julia; julia> view(a, :, 1, 1) .= view(c, 1, :, 1); ```. and instead throws `DimensionMismatch`. Does that boil down the issue @siddharthabishnu ?. Actually, it is curious that for some reason things do work out correctly if setting to a `Field`:. ```julia; julia> d = CenterField(grid);. julia> view(d, :, 1, 1) .= view(c, 1, :, 1);. julia> interior(d, :, 1, 1); 3-element view(::Array{Float64, 3}, 4:6, 4, 4) with eltype Float64:; 0.06779701769558852; -1.1932513091536738; -1.1239966299690682. julia> interior(c, 1, :, 1); 3-element view(::Array{Float64, 3}, 4, 4:6, 4) with eltype Float64:; 0.06779701769558852; -0.5935171905074843; 1.399692772040493; ```.

Availability,"Right. The masking is ""only"" for things like visualization / inspection of field values. We have implemented (or have tried to implement) a fully featured system for reducing fields in the presence of immersed boundaries; furthermore the tendency functions are ""boundary aware"", so the values of the fields inside the immersed boundaries _should_ be irrelevant. They could be NaN (maybe...). So we don't _need_ the mask for calculations. In fact I think we may want to use `NaN` as the mask value for output, because lots of visualization software (like Makie) will put blanks in for NaN, which is convenient... ?.

I think what would help the most is a simple benchmarking script that compares identical forcing function implementations with `ContinuousForcing` and `DiscreteForcing` to no forcing.

Availability,So the likely answer here is that CPU execution is no longer running through my custom Cassette infrastructure that inlined everything even on the CPU. So you are hitting the normal case of Julia deciding that it isn't worth inclining complicated functions.

Personally, I'm not sure whether this can be a dynamics test; something for which the error is just an order of magnitude less than the solution itself seems a bit loose for me... isn't there anything else we can use for a dynamics test? feels like we've been stuck on this for ages... we need a dynamics test to merge the cubed sphere code and move on I think. Perhaps there is no dynamics test we can have?. The solution @siddharthabishnu uses above **is not** an exact solution of the HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel equations... thus the big error. (It's an exact solution of the barotropic vorticity equation...)

Availability,"Some pretty promising Lagrangian particle tracking benchmarks!. Couple of takeaways (all assuming a model with 128^3 grid points and QAB2 time stepping):; 1. **Low overhead**: You can advect up to ~100,000 particles on the CPU and up to ~10,000,000 particles on a (Titan V) GPU before the model slows down by more than 30%.; 2. **Great on GPUs**: Seems that the GPU is great for advecting millions of particles. You can advect ~100,000,000 particles and your model only slows down by a factor of 4x. In this scenario, the GPU is ~620x faster than a single CPU core.; 3. Calculated using `(t_100000000 - t_0) / 100000000`, advecting a single particle on the CPU takes ~110 ns while on the GPU it only takes ~0.127 ns. This seems a little too good to be true but I'll double check this. I'll start refactoring this PR using @glwagner's and @zhenwu0728's feedback, but I think it would be really great if we can keep this performance. # Benchmarks. ```; Oceananigans v0.44.1; Julia Version 1.5.2; Commit 539f3ce943 (2020-09-23 23:17 UTC); Platform Info:; OS: Linux (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu); CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214 CPU @ 2.20GHz; WORD_SIZE: 64; LIBM: libopenlibm; LLVM: libLLVM-9.0.1 (ORCJIT, cascadelake); GPU: TITAN V; ```. ```; Lagrangian particle tracking benchmarks; ┌───────────────┬─────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────┐; │ Architectures │ N_particles │ min │ median │ mean │ max │ memory │ allocs │; ├───────────────┼─────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────┤; │ CPU │ 0 │ 361.749 ms │ 364.041 ms │ 364.293 ms │ 368.854 ms │ 293.44 KiB │ 1876 │; │ CPU │ 1 │ 375.030 ms │ 376.591 ms │ 377.959 ms │ 385.248 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 10 │ 377.251 ms │ 380.792 ms │ 387.560 ms │ 443.325 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 100 │ 378.867 ms │ 381.194 ms │ 381.328 ms │ 383.461 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │ CPU │ 1000 │ 378.076 ms │ 384.114 ms │ 383.611 ms │ 388.507 ms │ 297.16 KiB │ 1906 │; │",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1091#issuecomment-732529975:301,down,down,301,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1091#issuecomment-732529975,2,['down'],['down']
Availability,"Some progress:. The type infererence issue seems to be fixed. For `flow_over_hills.jl` the cost per time-step is approximately the same on my CPU for the ""reference case"" (no immersed boundary), and either free-slip or no-slip immersed boundary. I updated `flow_over_hills.jl` to introduce an initial perturbation that goes turbulent immediately. Here's a visualization of vorticity alongside total momentum loss for a 64x64 resolution:. https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15271942/163830810-8f15244b-27e2-4bf0-a7b2-e35d73bd8c79.mp4. The ""reference"" case has a no-slip boundary but no bathymetry. The momentum loss between reference and free-slip case are similar. No-slip and immersed boundary has the most momentum loss. The effect of the pressure errors can be seen plainly that there is transient _injection_ of momentum into the system, which isn't physically possible. However over long periods of time the momentum goes in the right direction. I'm wondering if anyone has experience with PALM, which I believe uses a very similar immersed boundary method (with no pressure solver correction)... ? They must have similar ""leakage"" errors.

Availability,"Sorry about the GPU errors, they're much scarier than they look! Looks like a pretty involved setup so I'll let @glwagner comment on the setup. In this case it looks like Julia is complaining about an `unsupported dynamic function invocation (call to overdub)` in `Fxn_scale` at line 93. ```julia; @inline Fxn_scale(t) = spl_scale(t); ```. which itself is calling some kind of spline. ```julia; spl_scale = Spline1D(secs, df.scale, k=1) ; ```. Since these functions are going to be called in GPU kernels, I think everything used by these functions should be made locally available to the functions and any arrays need to be `CuArray`s. Just looking around your script it looks like `secs` is just a regular array when it should be a `CuArray` if you want to use it in a GPU kernel, e.g. as part of `UniformStokesDrift`. I think the `df` dataframe object might not be GPU-compatible (i.e. it's not `isbits` and has no Adapt.jl function) so you might not want to use the `df` variable inside GPU kernels. It looks like you mostly use numbers from `df` (?) so you could instead pull out what you need. ```julia; const secs = CuArray(...); const scale = CuArray(...); const spl_scale = Spline1D(secs, scale, k=1); @inline Fxn_scale(t) = spl_scale(t); ```. You might also need to make variables `const`, e.g. `const secs = ...` so that they can be accessed from the GPU kernels. There's also the question of whether these splines are GPU-compatible, i.e. do they do the right thing on the GPU when given `CuArray`s instead of regular `Array`s. Unfortunately not every Julia package is GPU-compatible and not always efficient if it falls back on CPU methods to deal with `CuArray`s. I notice you're using Dierckx.jl for splines, which looks like a wrapper around a Fortran library so that's not going to work inside a GPU kernel. The Julia GPU/CUDA compiler can only compile pure Julia code to run on GPUs. We can look around a bit to see if there's a better package unless Dierckx splines are essential to ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1317#issuecomment-767551660:20,error,errors,20,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1317#issuecomment-767551660,4,"['avail', 'error']","['available', 'errors']"

Availability,"TODO list (some we might want to address before merging, some we probably should open issues about):. 1. We need a new `Connected` topology with N `Bounded` `Face`s instead of N+1. For MPI we might also need `LeftConnected` and `RightConnected`. . 2. For cubed sphere fields, re-use existing fields but with new types: `CubedSphereData` and `CubedSphereBoundaryConditions`. 3. Figure out a clean way of integrating `fill_horizontal_velocity_halos!` with the existing time-stepping. Perhaps we just need a `maybe_fill_horizontal_velocity_halos!` function that only does something on a connected cubed sphere. 4. We need values for the grid coordinates `λᶜᶠᵃ`, `λᶠᶜᵃ`, `φᶜᶠᵃ`, and `φᶠᶜᵃ` so that we can use `set!` for velocities on the cubed sphere. They are not provided by the file but we should be able to convert the available coordinates back to the cubed sphere face in (ξ, η) coordinates where -1 ≤ ξ, η ≤ 1 which forms a regular grid then interpolate in between and back to the sphere to get the other staggered grid coordinates. 5. We need to use the sine and cosine of the local angle between the grid orientation (e.g., u-velocity) and zonal west-east direction at the grid-cell centers to `set!` velocity fields. Right now we're limited to setting velocity fields from a streamfunction... 6. Should we be filling the halos of the grid metrics? Seems like they should be filled like velocity halos but without any sign changes. 7. Make sure that calling `fill_halo_regions!` on a horizontal velocity field only fills the halos with non-`CubedSphereExchange` boundary conditions. 8. Add the cubed sphere passive tracer advection and surface gravity waves validation experiments to validation CI pipeline. 9. Figure out a way to abstract and clean up `fill_horizontal_velocity_halos!` and `fill_*_halo!`... 10. Merge utils from `src/CubedSpheres/cubed_sphere_utils.jl` and `src/Distributed/distributed_utils.jl` into `Oceananigans.Grids`. 11.

Availability,"Thanks @glwagner and @francispoulin, I will give this a try and ping you both along the way. @francispoulin, I feel that having the free surface elevation rather than total height would be preferable too. About option 2, I am missing how introducing the h -> h + b transformation would work for the pressure gradient term. The governing equations only apply for flat-bottom cases the way they are currently set up, right? I ask this because the total thickness h = H + 𝜂 - b is used instead of the free surface 𝜂 in the pressure gradient terms and -g∂ₓ𝜂 = -g∂ₓ(h + b - H) = -g∂ₓh only if b = 0. Here H, 𝜂 and b are the mean thickness, the free surface and the bathymetry, respectively. So with bathymetry we would have -g∂ₓ(h + b - H) = -g∂ₓh -g∂ₓb, and in conservative form, -g∂ₓ(h²/2) **-gh∂ₓb**, right? so we would end up with this extra term proportional to the local bottom slope (as in _e.g._, https://github.com/FourierFlows/GeophysicalFlows.jl/pull/163#discussion_r554667472).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1712#issuecomment-1115149445:64,ping,ping,64,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1712#issuecomment-1115149445,1,['ping'],['ping']
Availability,"Thanks @glwagner for the help. Much appreciated. I tried to adapt it and the good news is that I don't get an error. The bad news is that I don't think the boundary conditions are being set correctly. . Below are a few ideas of things I think I need to do. Maybe you can confirm whether I understand this correctly?. - You had it set up for the sponge to depend on x but if I want the inflow and outflow to be in the south and north, respectively, then it should depend on `y`, right?; - `smoothed_step_mask` is currently only acting on the south. I pressume I need to add a similar function for the north?; - Do I need to have a sponge on `h` as well? I thought imposing this on `vh` might be enough in the case when the flow doesn't vary in the zonal direction. I imagine if I want inflow from the west only, which I do want, and the meridonal velocity depends on the zonal coordiante, then I should pick the sponge to relax to a geostrophically balanced state.; - Even though I am trying to set the inflow/outflow boundary conditions to `vh -> h` so that `v -> 1`, when I look at the final matrix, I have that `vh` is zero everywhere. This tells me that the boundary conditions are not being set. It does seem to say that `vh` does have `NormalFlow` boundary conditions so that seems like something is right. ```; using Oceananigans; using Oceananigans.Grids; using Oceananigans.Models; using Oceananigans.ImmersedBoundaries: ImmersedBoundaryGrid, GridFittedBoundary. using Oceananigans.BoundaryConditions: NormalFlow. grid = RegularRectilinearGrid(size=(64, 64),; x=(-10, 10), y=(0, 5),; topology=(Periodic, Bounded, Flat)). bump(x, y, z) = y < exp(-x^2); grid_with_bump = ImmersedBoundaryGrid(grid, GridFittedBoundary(bump)). damping_rate = 1/100 # relax fields on a 100 second time-scale; const y0 = 0 # center point of sponge; const dy = 1.0 # sponge width; smoothed_step_mask(x, y, z) = 1/2 * (1 + tanh((y - y0) / dy)). vh_sponge = Relaxation(rate=damping_rate, mask=smoothed_step_mask, target",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1730#issuecomment-852653935:110,error,error,110,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1730#issuecomment-852653935,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"Thanks @glwagner. I certainly don't want to make any changes that would either slow down code or make things harder to maintain. I can't say that I know this is the right direction to go but let me try and articulate what I want to do and maybe you can suggest a direction to proceed?. The basic idea can be found by looking at `shallow_water_Bickley_jet.jl`. In this example we define a `perturbation_norm` in line 134 that computes the norm of `v`. Then in line 158 we define an output_writer to output this norm. There is nothing special about v and I might want to use use `u` as well. To do this requires two steps:. 1. Defining a new analogous function for the perturbation norm of `u`. I'm hoping we can avoid these functions completely with `using Statistics: norm` but I don't know if that's the case.; 2. In line 161 we need to list these two norms. When I tried that there was an error message, and hence what inspired this PR.

Availability,"Thanks @tomchor for your feedback. It is greatly apprecaited. For the first point, I completely appreciate that we need to be clear. This can be done in the docstrings but it is certainly nice to pick variable names that are intuitive and make the code easier to read. I think Oceananigans does this very well and I very much want to continue in this direction. . I wonder if something like `zF_stretch` might do the trick? The `zF` suggests the result will be at faces and `stretch` suggests that this is a stretching of some kind. Or maybe `z_Faces_stretched`?. I am sorry if I mispoke. I did not mean to say that users do not care about what kind of stretched grid we use. This is clearly not the case. What I wanted to say is that a beginning user probably would be more concerned about having a stretched grid and probably not so much of the details. Some users would of course care a great deal about the kind of grid, and we definitely want to help both kinds of users. I agree with @glwagner 's suggestion of us supply a few basic examples for people to use, as a starting point. Users should certainly be able to take these examples, build on them, and build whatever kind of stretched grid they want. This is currently available and this should always be the case. When defining our examples we should not only define the region (or regions where we want it stretched, as it shouldn't only have to be one spot), but also the degree to which it decays. I don't necessarily have the language to describe this accurately now, but when putting together a sample function/array, I think a lot of this will beome clearer (to me at least).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1544#issuecomment-813565145:1229,avail,available,1229,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1544#issuecomment-813565145,2,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"Thanks for all the context! . Good points about the time step being more restricted by Coriolis for coarse global simulations and error being dominated by spatial discretization.

Availability,"Thanks for clarifying the situation @glwagner . I agree that it's easiest to first try comparing shallow water and hydrostatic model with no explicit dissiaption. The tools are all currently available and no new code needs to be written. Subsequently, we can try doing comparisions with explicit dissipations. One thing to mention is that the theory of western intensification says we will get western boundary currents as long as we have some kind of dissipation. This could be bottom drag (Stommel), lateral viscosity (Munk), hyperviscosity or anything else for that matter. Without having any explicit form of viscosity then the dissipation is slight and will yield western boundary currents of different widths, as the resolution changes and the implicit dissipation changes in magntiude with different resolutions. . Eventually it would be nice to have some explicit dissiaption since then we can show convergence with increasing resolution, but that is a longer term goal.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2522#issuecomment-1119964872:191,avail,available,191,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2522#issuecomment-1119964872,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"Thanks for the comments! I've rerun the simulation with Ri = 0.04 so that the viscous boundary layer is resolved. Horizontal resolution may still be an issue but I can roughly double it. We may also have to figure out which `C` to use, but might be more useful to do when we know we have a run that looks reasonable?. Just posting vertical profiles from that run. They look better but non-linear diffusivity profiles are still off. The shape of the profiles looks different from the figure I posted above. The magnitudes also seem very low (they're barely above the background values). Magnitude could be a plotting error (if it is I can't see it...). Discrepency could be because I'm doing the Pr = 0.7 case while the profiles posted in V&T figure 7 are for the Pr = 7 case.

Availability,"That could work --- though I'd point out that listing the model components that can be inconsistent with one another might be more explicit. I would advocate for a ""blacklisting"" method whereby blacklisted combinations of components are listed local to the implementation of the component. For example, in `beta_plane.jl` we could add. ```julia; validate_coriolis(::BetaPlane, ::AbstractGrid{FT, TX, <:Periodic}) where {FT, TX} = # error; ```. we also need, in `hydrostatic_spherical_coriolis.jl`,. ```julia; validate_coriolis(::HydrostaticSphericalCoriolis, ::AbstractRectilinearGrid) = # error; ```. I think a warning is better than an error for `WENO5` on a curvilinear grid. That'd be a fun scheme to experiment with and we don't know ""how wrong"" it is. If the curvilinear grid is almost regular, we have reason to think it might work. In cases like these where we aren't completely, rock-solid positive that a certain model configuration is invalid I think we should also err conservative and allow such models to be constructed. . We do need to strike a balance between being helicopter parents to users, and catching common mistakes.

Availability,"That was my doubt...; I am not sure wether bathymetry should be added to the momentum equations (as an additional pressure term) or to the continuity equation following ; https://capture.dropbox.com/LxsRg26SQzFKu4lb. I think it depends on how you define `h`. If `h = η + Const` then you add bathymetry to the continuity. If you want to add it to the momentum then `h = η + Const + hB` (and then you add the bathymetry to the momentum because you have to subtract it from the pressure term as bathymetry does not directly influence momentum, but it is directly included in the continuity in this way). The difference is between (if `h = η + Const + hB`); <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={\partial_tu-(\zeta%2Bf)v%2B\partial_x(gh%2Bk)=\partial_x g h_B}"">; <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={\partial_tv%2B(\zeta%2Bf)u%2B\partial_y(gh%2Bk)=\partial_y g h_B}"">; <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={\partial_th%2B\partial_x(hu)%2B\partial_y(hv)=0}"">. and (if `h = η + Const`); <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={\partial_tu-(\zeta%2Bf)v%2B\partial_x(gh%2Bk)=0}"">; <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={\partial_tv%2B(\zeta%2Bf)u%2B\partial_y(gh%2Bk)=0}"">; <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={\partial_th%2B\partial_x((h%2Bh_B)u)%2B\partial_y((h%2Bh_B)v)=0}"">. the two formulations should be equivalent. I don't know specifically which method is better, I though including it in the continuity would avoid cancellation errors, What do you think?. for the bathymetry, it is the same one I use for the hydrostatic model, but it has a ton of grid noise in it.

Availability,"That's a decent minimal example! Are you sure that the error requires `advection=WENO()` and `timestepper=:RungeKutta3`? The latter cannot be necessary since its the default (so omitting it has the same effect as including it). I find I can reproduce the error without `ImmersedBoundaryGrid` at all. About the error. The top of the message says. ```; ERROR: MethodError: no method matching cpu_fourier_tridiagonal_preconditioner_rhs!; ```. This means that the kernel function `fourier_tridiagonal_preconditioner_rhs!` is being called with the wrong arguments. For example:. ```julia; julia> f(x, y) = x + y; f (generic function with 1 method). julia> f(1); ERROR: MethodError: no method matching f(::Int64). Closest candidates are:; f(::Any, ::Any); @ Main REPL[1]:1. Stacktrace:; [1] top-level scope; @ REPL[2]:1; ```. The stacktrace shows. ```; [8] compute_preconditioner_rhs!(solver::Oceananigans.Solvers.FourierTridiagonalPoissonSolver{…}, rhs::Field{…}); @ Oceananigans.Solvers ~/.julia/packages/Oceananigans/HPOLD/src/Solvers/conjugate_gradient_poisson_solver.jl:109; ```. let's look at that line:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/6c40d7e225c2127051b2703b9c62a8b18260e3a5/src/Solvers/conjugate_gradient_poisson_solver.jl#L109-L110. This uses the Oceananigans utility `launch!` which launches the kernel `fourier_tridiagonal_preconditioner_rhs!` with the arguments `solver.storage, tridiagonal_dir, rhs`. However, looking at the function `fourier_tridiagonal_preconditioner_rhs` a few lines above. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/6c40d7e225c2127051b2703b9c62a8b18260e3a5/src/Solvers/conjugate_gradient_poisson_solver.jl#L93. we see that the function has 4 arguments, not 3. Hence the error. To summarize the analysis method, the key is to find the function that causes the error in the source code (`fourier_tridiagonal_preconditioner_rhs`) and then identify where it is called, and how it should be called.

Availability,"That's right. Purely for simplicity we launch all the tendency kernels from 1:N, though for Face-fields in Bounded directions, we only require 2:N. In fact using tendencies only from 2:N could allow an optimization where we don't need to ""enforce"" no-penetration boundary conditions. It'd be hard to achieve this optimization though because users can write things like `parent(u) .= 1` so I'm not sure we can get away with this being guaranteed correct. This has never been a problem because we simply overwrite the boundary velocity and therefore simply discard the tendency at index 1. > The problem is if we try to integrate something like a radiation condition. Can you point me to where in the code this goes down?. > On bounded topology I don't think we ever want to integrate the tendency right? But it might be more complicated to do that. I think that's right that we don't need the tendency. This has been part of the algorithm since time immemorial and back in the mists of time it was indeed more complicated than worthwhile. The complication is that KernelAbstractions assumes indices start at 1... However, we now have a way of offsetting indices in kernels via our `KernelParameters`. So it's not very hard to do this anymore. I can give it a start. If we make this change, we also want to take a step back and look at all the kernels we are launching currently to make sure everything makes sense. For example, here is a question: while we don't want to integrate the velocity tendencies on boundaries, what do we do about diagnostics?

In this case it is giving an error because it is trying to evaluate `GridFittedBottom` as a function of `(x, y)` while `seamount2` is a function of `(x, y, z)`. .

Availability,"The intended user experience is that only one line should need to be changed: `pickup=false` to `pickup=true` in `run!`. Therefore, users should not have to manually specify the ""part"" that they want to pick up from. I don't like option 2 above. I think that fixing this problem may become much easier if we can ""delay"" the creation of the output file. Right now, the output file is created when we build the output writer. But at that point, we have no way of knowing whether we are going to pick up or not. I've long wanted to implement this ""delay"" but more pressing matters have intervened... The basic thing we need to do is to add an `initialize!(output_writer, sim)` utility, which will create the output file. That function then will know whether the simulation is starting fresh (because `iteration(sim) == 0`, or whether it is ""continuing""). One huge feature this will enable is the ability to avoid overwriting an existing file when it represents the output from the current continuing run. That's a huge problem with the current interface, is that you have to be really careful about `overwrite_existing` if you are trying to pickup from a checkpoint. And I think that's a big problem. With that feature I think we can also figure out how to handle output that is split into multiple files --- because we know if a simulation is continuing that we will have to figure out which `part` to use (if any). > continues writing into the most recent output file once it catches up to the latest unsaved iteration. This is a separate feature from what I was talking about, but I think it's also a great idea! There also may be a clue how to solve a roundoff error issue, where two outputs are written one iteration separate from one another, but at virtually identical times (eg distinguished only by machine epsilon).

Availability,"There is a fair amount of scalar iteration right now, largely I think because we have array-like objects (Fields, and friends) that lack fully-featured broadcasting capabilities. This means writing something like `a .== 2` triggers scalar iteration on the GPU because it hits Base broadcasting. We _can_ fix the problem by fleshing out broadcasting a bit so `a .== 2` works ""correctly"" / sensibly, but we haven't prioritized it (we also didn't have broadcasting at all for Field until a month or two ago). Possibly, if changing a global via `allowscalar(true)` were not available we would have been forced to address this deficiency in our Field abstraction sooner. So that could have been a good thing depending on your perspective. It did allow us to sweep some things under the hood.

Availability,"There's been some developments since we discussed this last. I think these developments argue for two separately maintained models for the near future and possibly forever. Mostly this regards #1679 and the implementation of general vertical coordinates. While its true that we _could_ implement nonhydrostatic physics in a sigma-coordinate model, I don't personally plan on attempting this any time soon. And I think such an attempt would be a major effort. It's also just turning out to be not all that difficult to maintain two model constructors. The two models share tons of code under the hood. So I propose maintaining a split between hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic models for the near future. With that I think it does make sense to rename `IncompressibleModel` to `NonhydrostaticModel`. `IncompressibleModel` is downright confusing given that both the `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` and, technically, the `ShallowWaterModel` are all incompressible. At first I was hesitant to propose this because a blind search and replace might mutilate formatting everywhere in the code. But then I realized that `Incompressible` and `Nonhydrostatic` have the same number of characters:. ```; IncompressibleModel; NonhydrostaticModel; ```. wow! :-O So we can actually just blindly search-replace to eternal glory.

Availability,"This is a great question, though more of a Julia issue than something specific to Oceananigans! However, there is an off-chance that there is some feature we could implement to make this easier for people. Note that terminals also have line limits and its a problem for people working in the terminal too. I use the silly but practical solution of reducing my font size and re-executing code until l can see the top of the error message. However, there are probably other solutions. I wrote up a little example to experiment:. ```julia; using Oceananigans; grid = RectilinearGrid(size=(1, 1, 1), extent=(1, 1, 1)); model = HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel(; grid); simulation = Simulation(model, Δt=1.0); bad_callback(sim) = error(""Why did you write such a bad callback?""); simulation.callbacks[:error] = Callback(bad_callback); run!(simulation); ```. Some hunting on google returned this thread: https://discourse.julialang.org/t/redirect-output-and-error-to-a-file/58908/3. One option is to pipe to a file with the terminal utility `tee`:. ```julia; $ julia --project | tee out.txt; ```. All output generated thereafter is written to `out.txt`. I can't really see myself using this solution though. Changing the text size is easier... It looks it may also be possible to use the Julia module `StackTraces`:. https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/stacktraces/.

Then users could implement this kind of optimization in their script by using an array to represent the forcing, and then by precomputing the forcing into that array using a kernel that only evaluates some subset of all the cells in a callback.

Availability,"This seems to work out-of-the box with our simple example, but I'm encountering errors when applying to one of my complex scripts. I'm getting errors of the kind `ERROR: LoadError: Custom output b_tot needs dimensions!`. And when I do specify the dimensions manually I get `Trying to write (1, 1, 16) elements while [17, 1] are expected`. So clearly we're missing something. Looking at the behavior of `AveragedField` I think we should not `dropdim` when doing the average anymore since `AveragedField` always returns a 3D array:. ```julia; julia> bmean = AveragedField(b, dims=(1, 2)); AveragedField over dims=(1, 2) located at (⋅, ⋅, Center) of Field located at (Center, Center, Center); ├── data: OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64,3,Array{Float64,3}}, size: (1, 1, 20); ├── grid: RegularRectilinearGrid{Float64, Periodic, Bounded, Bounded}(Nx=1, Ny=1024, Nz=16); ├── dims: (1, 2); ├── operand: Field located at (Center, Center, Center); └── status: time=0.0. julia> bmean.data; 1×1×20 OffsetArray(::Array{Float64,3}, 1:1, 1:1, -1:18) with eltype Float64 with indices 1:1×1:1×-1:18:; [:, :, -1] =; 0.0.

I think maybe the issue is because `WindowedSpatialAverage` is returning an Array, and not an OffsetArray. Any thoughts?. ```julia; julia> bwind = WindowedSpatialAverage(b, dims=(1, 2), field_slicer=FieldSlicer(j=3:7)); WindowedSpatialAverage{Field{Center,Center,Center,OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64,3,Array{Float64,3}},RegularRectilinearGrid{Float64,Periodic,Bounded,Bounded,OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64,1,StepRangeLen{Float64,Base.TwicePrecision{Float64},Base.TwicePrecision{Float64}}}},NamedTuple{(:x, :y, :z),Tuple{CoordinateBoundaryConditions{BoundaryCondition{Oceananigans.BoundaryConditions.Periodic,Nothing},BoundaryCondition{Oceananigans.BoundaryConditions.Periodic,Nothing}},CoordinateBoundaryConditions{BoundaryCondition{F",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1397#issuecomment-783777559:80,error,errors,80,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1397#issuecomment-783777559,5,"['ERROR', 'error']","['ERROR', 'errors']"

Availability,"Those are all possible developments. To put fields in `closure` we have to implement a pattern (implemented for things like boundary conditions, though it's taken a lot of work to get it right) whereby users instantiate a ""template"" `closure`, to which fields / data are added later given knowledge of the grid in the model constructor. Otherwise, users have to provide `grid` as an argument when constructing both a closure and a model. Either pattern is possible --- but implementing a ""template + materialization"" design is complicated, whereas requiring users to provide `grid` when constructing a closure changes the API. When a complicated algorithm endows the code with more features, I feel it could be justified if the feature is good enough. But if its only purpose is to rearrange where array references are bound, it feels less worth the trade off of code maintenance and the work to implement it. Another solution is documentation. Storing constant values in `diffusivities` is possible, but could be interpreted as boilerplate. The coefficients need to be stored in `closure`, because that's where users specify them. So copying the constants or functions into `diffusivities` (this would have to be done individually for all closures) requires additional code. I think of all the changes to `diffusivities`, the one that makes the most sense is to eliminate that field and change the API so that `grid` is a required argument for closures that have fields associated with them. This is a substantial internal refactor, but perhaps someone wants to take it up?.

Availability,"To compare the numerical solution of the Rossby-Haurwitz wave on the cubed sphere against an established benchmark, I chose the exact solution of the non-linear barotropic vorticity equation on the sphere (not the solution of the non-linear shallow water equations). This was achieved by replacing the initial phase Rλ with the time-dependent phase Rλ−νt in Equations (143)–(146) of [Williamson et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999105800166), using the angular velocity ν given by Equation (142). The results at a resolution of 128x128 cells per panel are as follows:. - Since we prescribe the initial stream function and numerically take its derivatives to specify the initial velocities on the cubed sphere, numerical errors are present even in the initial velocities and the diagnosed initial vorticity. The vorticity error is significantly pronounced near the cubed sphere corners due to the deviation from orthogonality. For instance, in the domain's interior, the vorticity error norm is three orders of magnitude less than the vorticity norm, whereas at the corners, it is nearly the same order of magnitude.; - As the simulation progresses, the amplified error from the corners propagates into the interior as expected. After 500 time steps, the vorticity error in the interior increases from three orders of magnitude less to one order of magnitude less than the vorticity norm. I have attached panel-wise plots of the exact vorticity and the error of its numerical counterpart on the cubed sphere for the initial condition and after 500 time steps for reference. Given these circumstances, @navidcy and I are contemplating whether we should continue using the exact solution for verification in the test script or consider alternative verification methods, such as ensuring that the norm of the numerical solution of the Rossby-Haurwitz wave remains bounded within a specified range (as mentioned in the introduction to this PR). @glwagner, @simone-silvestri an",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3570#issuecomment-2134152684:750,error,errors,750,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/3570#issuecomment-2134152684,2,['error'],"['error', 'errors']"

Availability,"To summarize what I think is happening: the immersed boundary is working essentially as expected in that the immersed boundary ""appears"" like a solid wall in visualization and qualitative inspection of the solution. However, small errors in both the pressure gradient and the boundary condition accumulate over the course of the simulation. The result is a realistic looking simulation with an immersed boundaries whose nonlinear trajectory gradually but persistently deviates _point-by-point_ from the ""true"" solution. We should also check the tracer budget. I expect that the tracer is not conserved due to leakage through the boundary. There is some subtlety in the implementation of the masking. Here, we only mask the _predictor velocity field_, prior to the pressure correction step. This ensures that the velocity field which is used to calculate tendency terms is divergence-free to machine precision. However, this also means that the impenetrable boundary condition is not satisfied exactly, because there is an unbalanced pressure gradient across the boundary. As a result, tracer ""leaks"" across the boundary. An alternative implementation might mask the velocity field both prior to the correction step, and when the auxiliary state is updated (as is done for `HydrostaticFreeSurfaceModel` and `ShallowWaterModel`). But this is not a cure for tracer conservation because the flux form advection schemes we use assume that the velocity field is divergence free. The upshot is that we cannot achieve tracer conservation (or momentum conservation) with immersed boundaries unless we modify the pressure solver. An easy thing to try is to use the `PreconditionedConjugateGradientSolver` to ""polish off"" the pressure field obtained from the FFT based solver such that a correct pressure field + divergence free velocity field is obtained.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1733#issuecomment-855109309:231,error,errors,231,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/1733#issuecomment-855109309,4,"['error', 'mask']","['errors', 'mask', 'masking']"

Availability,"Very good point. The background buoyancy does not satisfy the boundary conditions that are imposed. I will check it out later.

The second time-step is when QuasiAdamsBashforth2 uses tendency information saved from the previous time-step. On the first time-step it's equivalent to a forward Euler scheme. I know the differences are small, 8th decimal place or so, but on such a coarse grid should we be expecting the same answers?. Hardware differences can produce results that differ by something like sqrt(eps(Float64)) I think. This is the tolerance we use for regression tests (but even those sometimes fail to pass on the GPU for some reason).

Availability,"Very good questions. I don't have very good answers, but happy to share my thoughts. I don't know how things will change for velocity but it should be clearer after we figure out how to deal with the tracers. As for how the velocity is set, we always set the normal velocity to be zero at the interface. The only difference is the `ParitalCell` has a bottom that can be higher and we need to take this into account when computing the fluxes in and out of this region. We haven't gotten there yet but it's part of the plan. There aren't any essential differences between the current method, what we call `GridFitted` and Adcroft et al. call a `FullCell` method, and the `PartialCell` method. The former is the limit when we choose the height of the topography in a cell interface to be zero, whereas the latter can pick it to be between a tolerance (currently 0.2) and 1 of the full depth. So the `GridFitted` boundary must have the boundary between fluid and solid at a face, whereas `PartialCell` can have it anywhere in the interior. That means that the interface is really at i + alpha where 0 \le alpha < 1, or something like that. I can imagine that sometime in the future they are part of the same function, but much testing must happen before. I don't believe we need to change how `solid_interface` works but I need to look over how it's defined to make sure.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2251#issuecomment-1042491748:838,toler,tolerance,838,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2251#issuecomment-1042491748,2,['toler'],['tolerance']
Availability,"Very nice @simone-silvestri . I think we have to regenerate the ocean LES regression test data. Unfortunately this regression test doesn't use `DataDeps` yet so regenerating it will increase the size of the repo by a little bit. Another option is to refactor the regression tests to use DataDeps but this might be best saved for a future PR. I think this fix may actually resolve some ancient issues that we didn't understand until now, for example:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/1179. To summarize:. When running a model that has both `Periodic` and `Bounded` directions, _and_ when using a stencil that touches corner points (such as with `coriolis isa FPlane`, the order in which halos are filled matters. In particular, we must fill periodic directions _last_, because the corners then depend on a halo point which is just outside the boundary in the `Bounded` direction(s). The ocean large eddy simulation regression test is one such case (horizontally-periodic, bounded in z). There is a no-flux surface velocity boundary condition that creates a dependency between the bounded and periodic halo fills. The previous algorithm assumed that all halos could be filled simultaneously with no dependencies on one another. However, because the CPU is serial the halos were nevertheless filled in the ordering prescribed by `fill_halo_regions!`:. https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/blob/2d6ccfe94ce2c68857f70b2f8839020049932e00/src/BoundaryConditions/fill_halo_regions.jl#L32-L42. In other words, the vertical halos (the bounded direction) are filled last on the CPU. On the GPU the ordering may change because on the GPU KernelAbstractions is no longer serial. Thus on occasion the periodic halos might have been filled _after_ the bounded halos, leading to a failure of the regression test. This PR fixes that issue so that periodic directions are always filled last. So I think we should expect that regression tests fail on both the CPU and GPU.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2035#issuecomment-958102800:1785,failure,failure,1785,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/pull/2035#issuecomment-958102800,1,['failure'],['failure']

Availability,"We could certainly add a field `error` to `NaNChecker` and throw an error if `error=true`, too. Another possibility though is to design a new `schedule` that doesn't actuate if NaNs are detected. This could be used generically for output writing and checkpointing. Maybe a wrapper like. ```julia; schedule = Skip(hasnan, TimeInterval(100)); ```. Then when the scheduled is queried, if `hasnan(model)` is true, the actuator returns false; otherwise the ""child schedule"" (`TimeInterval(100)` in this case) is queried. Other ""skip conditions"" could be provided to `Skip` as well. I think the nice thing about this solution is that it's more robust than hoping the NaNChecker wil throw an error.

Availability,"We have fully implemented a hard coded drag into all of the momentum viscous fluxes. Since this implementation of the drag has different values for ""symmetric"" fluxes such as `viscous_flux_uy` and `viscous_flux_vx` that are located at the same point, the `conditional_flux_fcc` location-separated fluxes were not enough. We split these into functions such as `conditional_flux_fcc_uy` and `conditional_flux_fcc_vx`. It'll be easier to address these issues directly in the immersed `viscous_flux` once we have a separate term in the tendency equations with its own functions. . These functions then check whether the interface between solid and fluid is at the top of a cell or the bottom of a cell, applying the correctly directioned drag for that side. The way these conditionals work, the fully immersed cells that aren't on a boundary would be calculating fluxes as usual, except that all those terms are masked. So the fluxes inside the solid will remain zero. When the solid-fluid interface is at the top or right hand side of a cell, the velocities for that `(i,j,k)` location will all be within the solid. If you use them in your drag functions, it would just be zero flux. So, the drag at a top flux interface, for instance, located at `(i,j,k)` will use the velocities at `(i,j,k-1)`, and so on for the other directions. This makes them match the usual non-immersed drag BC for the 1D case as seen below. . https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67593861/160839128-37ab95fa-f28b-43c0-8bbf-3c850ae754f2.mp4. https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67593861/160839127-912ee3d0-75e9-4536-a494-2ec3c6c2b006.mp4. https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67593861/160839125-bef17105-d8ac-4999-a3f0-fbbb55e8498a.mp4. @tomchor has also tested them with 3D setups, which worked as well!

Availability,"We need an MPI tips / wiki section... been working on getting distributed simulations running on Engaging since yesterday (we need people to be able to start running distributed simulations immediately with minimal start up time). Here are a few things I learned:. * Remember to load a system MPI on your HPC, eg `module load openmpi`; * MPI may have to be installed / configured carefully --- after loading a system MPI. `MPIPreferences` can help:. ```julia; using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary(); ```. https://juliaparallel.org/MPI.jl/stable/configuration/. * Configuring SLURM correctly may also require some trial and error, because the documentation is unclear and there are a huge number of options. I can't figure out if the documentation is wrong, in fact, or if instead the engaging cluster does not support some options. Either way, a small test script like. ```julia; using MPI. MPI.Init(); @show MPI.Comm_rank(MPI.COMM_WORLD); @show MPI.Comm_size(MPI.COMM_WORLD); ```. Is helpful for debugging. Also, I recommend first trying to start jobs interactively before using `sbatch`. Interactive jobs launch faster, so we get a faster trial-error iteration. I'm still working on things, but it seems like another point may be salient:. * Initialize / precompile outside of a parallel job before trying to launch a parallel job via `mpiexec`. Here are some notes that may be specific to engaging:. I'm using `srun` to get a 4-GPU node to use interactively:. ```; srun -p my_partition --tasks-per-node=4 --cpus-per-task=32 --gres=gpu:4 --gpus-per-node=4 --mem=0 -t 01:00:00 -N 1; ```. it seems we have to use the option `gpus-per-node`, rather than setting the total number of GPUs. Also we redundantly also have to specify `gres=gpu:4` (`gres` stands for ""generalized resource""). Why `gres` can't tell what `gpus-per-node` is, I don't know. `-N 1` means 1 node.

Availability,"We should have a way to mask the tracers for sure. On the other hand, in our current algorithm we do not ""use"" immersed ""halo"" nodes because we impose a no-flux condition by just setting to zero the fluxes on the immersed boundaries - opposed to actual boundaries where the ""no-flux"" condition is imposed by mirroring the values outside the boundary and explicitly calculating a flux.

So, it is not necessary, but It is definitely a function we want to allow...; I see the confusion, what I meant is we need to remove it if it is done within the time stepping, but we leave the functionality there",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2249#issuecomment-1042502180:24,mask,mask,24,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2249#issuecomment-1042502180,2,['mask'],['mask']
Availability,"We use that function to initialize a correct array before performing global reductions (i.e. all zeros for sums, all 1s for prods and so on...) which are called when showing a field (if you put a semicolon after `myfield = CenterField(grid)` the error will disappear) Apparently they have changed the signature of the function in julia-1.8. Adapting Oceananigans to the new `initarray!` was on the table, I guess it's a good time to fix it",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,CliMA,Oceananigans.jl,v0.93.2,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2663#issuecomment-1185068632:246,error,error,246,https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable,https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl/issues/2663#issuecomment-1185068632,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"We're getting errors when running the tests on buildkite that I'm not getting when running on a GPU locally. For example this:. ```julia; Field boundary conditions [GPU, RectilinearGrid]: Test Failed at /net/ocean/home/data44/data5/glwagner/.buildkite-agent/builds/sverdrup-7/clima/oceananigans/test/test_computed_field.jl:475; --;   | Expression: #= /net/ocean/home/data44/data5/glwagner/.buildkite-agent/builds/sverdrup-7/clima/oceananigans/test/test_computed_field.jl:475 =# CUDA.@allowscalar all(ST.data[1:Nx, 1:Ny, 0] .== ST.data[1:Nx, 1:Ny, 1]); ```. The above line works for me on GPU when doing `include(""test_computed_field.jl"")`, but for some reason fails on buildkite. @glwagner @simone-silvestri any ideas as to why?
