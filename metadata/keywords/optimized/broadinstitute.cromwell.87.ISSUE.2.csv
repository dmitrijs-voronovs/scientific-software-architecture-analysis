Here is a snippet of my configuration:. ```; backend {; default = ""JES""; providers {; JES {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.impl.jes.JesBackendLifecycleActorFactory""; 	 .... snip...; 	 genomics {; 			....snip.... 			 # Specifies the zone(s) to use for JES jobs unless overridden by a task's runtime attributes; 			 default-zones = [""us-central1-f"", ""us-central1-c""]; 		....snip....; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2527:405,configurat,configuration,405,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2527,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

My expectation is that when run, the first ls will print out the current directory contents (which will not include anything matching `this_file_should_only_exist_for_second_ls.*` ) and then the second ls will have the same directory contents except also with a `this_file_should_only_exist_for_second_ls.{current_date_and_time}` included, and then the workflow will fail due to the non existent output file. This is indeed the behavior when run with PAPIv2 backend, based on looking at the stdout in the execution bucket. However, if I run with GCPBATCH backend, at first the stdout in the execution bucket will show the expected behavior. However, the workflow will keep running, and the stdout will soon change. In the updated stdout, the first ls will include a single file matching `this_file_should_only_exist_for_second_ls.*` as well as an unexpected `rc` file, along with two (instead of one) `tmp.*` files. The second ls will then include a second file matching `this_file_should_only_exist_for_second_ls.*` , along with the other unexpected files. My interpretation of this is that the task is being reattempted with the same filesystem, without any cleaning of the filesystem between runs. I have also found that if the task is not run with preemptible, or if there aren't any missing output files, then the behavior will be as expected (even if the task still fails due to a non-zero exit code). There's a few different combinations of settings I tried in `test.wdl`.

Do you have any ideia why this is happening? ; Thanks in advance",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6106:15182,pipeline,pipeline,15182,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6106,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Just to clarify, I did not submit multiple identical jobs. Everything on my end was kosher. . In any case, theres the issue - its not the first I've had with Cromwell (you can see previous discussions related to this at e.g. https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/wdl/discussion/comment/50624#Comment_50624) . I had to make lots of modifications to my configuration file before I got it to work as well as it does now. So if you have any idea what is causing this or any changes to my configuration file you'd recommend id greatly appreciate your help. Thanks a lot,. Alon.

I understand that the issue is that the Google bucket where the docker is located is requester pays and Cromwell does not know what to do in this case, but it is not immediately clear what I should do to fix it. It would be a great improvement if Cromwell could interpret this response and provide a more informative error message so that the user could immediately know what needs to be addressed. In particular, I am not fully sure what I should be doing. These are excerpts from my configuration file:; ```; ...; engine {; filesystems {; gcs {; auth = ""service-account""; project = ""xxx""; }; }; }; ...; services {; MetadataService {; ...; config {; carbonite-metadata-service {; filesystems {; gcs {; auth = ""service-account""; }; }; ...; }; }; }; }; ...; backend {; default = PAPIv2. providers {; PAPIv2 {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.google.pipelines.v2beta.PipelinesApiLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; project = ""xxx""; ...; filesystems {; gcs {; auth = ""service-account""; project = ""xxx""; ...; }; }; ...; }; }; }; }; ...; ```; Where should the configuration for telling Cromwell which project to use when pulling dockers be?. I also do not understand why this issue arises at all as the Google bucket with the dockers is a us multi-region bucket and the computation is in us-central1, so there should be no egress costs when pulling the docker and therefore no need for a billing project. Clearly I am not understanding this problem entirely.

Excluding `calls` would make a huge difference for us, because for large workflows it takes a long time for Cromwell to aggregate all calls, the response becomes large, and sometimes it even timeouts. <!-- Paste your configuration if possible, MAKE SURE TO OMIT PASSWORDS, TOKENS AND OTHER SENSITIVE MATERIAL: -->",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4362:1152,configurat,configuration,1152,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4362,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

When running a workflow with `google_project` and/or `google_compute_service_account` workflow options defined, those two options don't take/have any effect on the workflow. The workflow executes in the project defined in the Batch backend config, using the service account defined in the Batch backend config. This breaks the ability to run workflows cross-project from a single cromwell instance with a single gcp backend (which was supported in PAPI). Workarounds like defining multiple backends (each for a separate project/compute sa) are not ideal. Looking through the Batch [backend code](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/4cddc6163b0b1d73e02f3723a82634df852b754b/supportedBackends/google/batch/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/google/batch/api/GcpBatchRequestFactoryImpl.scala#L168-L169), it seems the issue is the `parent` and `gcpSa` are populated from `batchAttributes` and `gcpBatchParameters` rather than `createParameters` where the workflow options would override the values defined in the backend config.

Deployability,"@curoli commented on [Wed Oct 04 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl4s/issues/248). Currently, subclasses of WOM GraphNodes are case classes which auto-generate equals and hashCode based on components. This doesn't work well for two reasons.; First, WOM Graph assumes object identity and will fail if a node is replaced by one that is equal based on components. The code is already in several places using eq instead of == to account for this.; Second, since graph nodes contain all upstream nodes, component-based hashCode or equals are unworkable for real-life pipelines, because hashCode/equals will be called for every upstream node through every possible upstream path, which grows exponentially with graph size for workflows that contain branches that rejoin (and most do). . ---. @danbills commented on [Thu Oct 05 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl4s/issues/248#issuecomment-334536133). I think this comment is more appropriate here:. Equals is supposed to be bitwise/value-based equality, whereas `eq` indicates reference equality. I don't recall the exact motivation behind using `eq` in the test, maybe @cjllanwarne can comment when he returns on Tuesday. ---. @curoli commented on [Thu Oct 05 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl4s/issues/248#issuecomment-334555964). If you don't like this fix, what do you suggest we do instead? How about we accept this fix now and you can rework the whole thing later, if you want?. This is a show-stopper once you want to create larger (aka real-life) workflows. . For example: if node a has two outputs, which are inputs of b, then b.hashCode calls a.hasCode twice. If b produces two outputs which are inputsof c, then c.hashCode calls b.hashCode twice, and a.hashCode is called four times. If c produces two outputs which are inputs of d, d.hashCode calls c.hashCode twice, b.hashCode four times and a.hashCode eight times, etc. . ---. @curoli commented on [Thu Oct 05 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl4s/issues/248",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2694:571,pipeline,pipelines,571,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/2694,2,['pipeline'],['pipelines']

PR creates a GHA (currently runs on dispatch, can be updated to run on schedule of choice) that creates a billing project and BEE, attaches the BEE to a static landing zone, creates a workspace and provisions an app within the BEE, submits a workflow (basic hello world) to Cromwell, and performs app/workspace/billing project cleanup afterwards. BEE template is flagged by Janitor for post workflow cleanup to ensure no lingering resources. Workspace deletion and billing project deletion are finicky due to invariable timing of the deletion itself (can be either extremely short or longer than 12 minutes), so those two steps are handled by either an exception block (workspace deletion) or `continue-on-error` (billing project) to ensure that failures there do not reflect a failure on the test against Cromwell. Workspace provisioning and app creation are necessary for running tests against Cromwell, so a failure there will be reported as a failure on the Cromwell test. (As an aside, this could be rectified by having a static testing app that's always running in a dedicated testing environment. Test could be updated to run submissions against it so as long as that app is kept up to date.

Deployability,"As a pipeline author, I don't enjoy having to spin up a VM, with docker in order to do string substitutions on my parameters. In the GOTC pipeline, we do this in order to strip off the extension of the input file in order to get a base-name, which happens ~40 times in a 20-plex workflow. . This causes a real problem because by requiring so many VMs to spun up, we spend more money (although that cost is quite small) but also eat into our quotas and QPS limits, which actually does hurt our scalability. The proposal is to add a new expression language function which allows for regex substitutions:. sub(string, pattern, replacement). For example,. to strip off an extension from a file you could use `sub(filename, "".bam$"","""")`; to swap an extension, you could use `sub(filename, "".bam$"", "".metrics"")`. By being constrained to a regex (unlike an arbitrary code block) we don't have concerns about security or evaluating these in the cromwell engine. This does not eliminate the need for a generally more expressive expression language or user defined functions, but does solve a large class of common usages that impact ease of use and performance",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/597:5,pipeline,pipeline,5,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/597,2,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"As a pipeline author, sometimes I have pipelines which require lots of input files. For example, the joint calling pipeline at one point has a step where I need to combine genotypes from all the samples. This can be in the 10,000s range and growing. Currently, this causes lots of problems. In Cromwell having that many inputs causes memory and database problems because parameters are first class citizens and there are so many of them. In addition they are file paths which can be very long. This can lead to GBs of footprint. Similarly this causes problem for the underlying backend (e.g. JES) because of the volume. Recently our requests to JES were truncated because a load-balancer in front of the service had a maximum request size. I would like to be able to instead specify a file, which is full of file names. My task will know what to do with this. I need a way to indicate this in wdl (perhaps a new type, like FOFN instead of File?). With this information, the Cromwell backend can do the correct thing during localization. For example in JES, we would tell the JES Api this is a FOFN. . Each backend would then need to handle this type. When receiving a FOFN input type the backend would first localize the FOFN and then iterate through the contents to localize each file. A new FOFN would then be rewritten to reference the local paths, and that FOFN would be used in place of the original FOFN as parameters to the tasks. . First, we should conduct a feasibility effort on this with a thought experiment on the joint calling workflow to see if FOFNs would solve the parameter space problem ( #1059 )",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1058:5,pipeline,pipeline,5,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1058,3,['pipeline'],"['pipeline', 'pipelines']"

There currently does not seem to be a satisfactory way to guard against this:. - We can't make our image repositories private because we want to make the workflows available to the public via Terra.; - We can't make the repositories requester-pays because the pipelines API does not support pulling images from requester-pays repositories.; - We can mirror our repositories to different regions, but we are still dependent on our users to configure their workflows to point to the right region and take good-faith extra steps to help us avoid these charges. Some possible ideas were suggested by @freeseek in https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6235:. - Convince Google to support requester-pays buckets for container pulls in PAPI.; - Modify some combination of Cromwell/PAPI to cache images rather than pulling them for each task that is run.; - Develop infrastructure within Cromwell to know what region the workflow is running in and automatically select the right GCR mirror to pull from.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6442:593,pipeline,pipelines,593,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/6442,1,['pipeline'],['pipelines']

This is a transient failure that should already be retried -- and a part of the problem here is the inability to confirm if the operation was retried as expected. So there were two discussed solutions:; 1. Log the number of attempts to read a file as a part of the failure message for a job.; 2. There is a Cromwell configuration for the number of times an IO operation should be retried -- raise that number as a way to retry cloud hiccups.,MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4069:37,integrat,integration,37,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/4069,2,"['configurat', 'integrat']","['configuration', 'integration']"

Deployability,By default all cromwell task containers submitted by Google Cloud backend doesn't allow user to mount any filesystems within a container. It happens because containers are launched without specific linux capabilities being enabled. . Nevertheless filesystem mounts can be of help in some workflows because it doesn't require all the task resources to be localized or to be embedded in docker images. Google pipelines api allows to set `ENABLE_FUSE` flag for all submitted action. Once specified it forces Google pipelines engine to launch action containers with additional linux capabilities such as `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` being enabled. The pull request adds support for launching cromwell task containers with an enabled support for fuses in Google Cloud. Fuses support can be enabled via a workflow option `enable_fuse` or via a Google Cloud backend configuration attribute `backend.providers.Papiv2.config.genomics.enable-fuse`.,MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/5343:407,pipeline,pipelines,407,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/5343,3,"['configurat', 'pipeline']","['configuration', 'pipelines']"

To allow for dynamic access to GPUs, I propose to extend `gpuCount` type to allow for a null value, and to check for a non-null value for resource allocation. https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/bfef756ca35b46570dff3fda57f77dd4b2b0d25c/supportedBackends/google/pipelines/common/src/main/scala/cromwell/backend/google/pipelines/common/PipelinesApiRuntimeAttributes.scala#L193.

It would be way easy to manually delete given `call` folder from cromwell working directory `cromwell-execution/piplene/wfID/call-xxx` and resubmit the workflow to server with something like that: `submit --resubmit wfID newimport.zip`. 2) my workflow failes on some task due to bug in the code – I’m editing the code and resubmitting it so workflow just continue where it stops. 3) I'd like to change parameters of some of the later steps of the pipeline but do not want to waste time on re-running the beginning of the pipeline (which usually has a computationally heavy tasks like mapping, calling, etc).

Deployability,"Debugging or profiling a running Cromwell has always been extremely painful due to the need to `apt install` all the tools manually.

All of the image changes are in limited in scope to `installDebugFacilities` function. The rest of the diff is rationalizing our build system. Previously, we had `isSnapshot`, `isRelease`, and ""neither of those"". The logic was confusing around which took precedence. I replaced the bag o' booleans with a type system representing the types. The ""neither of those"" now has a name `Standard`. And finally I augmented it with `Debug`.

Deployability,"During the testing hackathon, we discovered a number of problems caused by the eventual consistency of the metadata service. One specific case of this is the granularity of the events. . On one side, we have a publisher who has a whole collection of events that they would like to push. They push them one event at a time to the MD service. Because even things like array elements are pushed one update at a time because of MD format, we run into the situation where a consumer can see half of an array. Taken to the extreme, we could push every char of a string as a separate event. The fundamental problem with these partial updates is that a downstream consumer can not tell if an update is complete. Do they wait? How long? Can they check if the data is done?. While this touches on a larger problem in distributed computing, I think we are shooting ourselves in the foot by making every piece of a single update an async, isolated event. Taken to the extreme, we could push every char of a string as a separate event. The proposal is to extend the PutMetadataAction to take in a Seq/Varargs of MetadataEvents with the contract that these will be made available atomically (e.g. in a single Slick transaction for our implementation). Then in places where we basically unrolling a bundle of events to publish, we should use this API (e.g. WorkflowExecutionActor) to do that atomically. .

Deployability,"EDIT: Changed A/C to use default sentry style configuration, instead of wiring custom HOCON configs. **Issue:**; Whenever Cromwell generates a warning or error message an additional message is emitted from `raven-logback` about a ""suitable DSN"". ```; [2018-05-18 21:17:10,79] [warn] SingleWorkflowRunnerActor: received unexpected message: Done in state RunningSwraData; [2018-05-18 21:17:10,80] [warn] Couldn't find a suitable DSN, defaulting to a Noop one.; ```. This appears to be because `raven-logback` is activated in logback.xml but is not configured by default in Cromwell. **Background:**; [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) describes itself as:. > Open-source error tracking that helps developers monitor and fix crashes in real time. Cromwell is using an deprecated version of the Sentry java bindings for logback called `raven-logback`. The current bindings are called `sentry-logback`. Additionally, the cromwell docs currently mention that sentry can be setup via the ""configuration value"" `sentry.dsn`. https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/b8d3d2fd4a583d3e46394efb104005c12cdf182d/docs/Logging.md#L48. https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/b8d3d2fd4a583d3e46394efb104005c12cdf182d/docs/Configuring.md#L345-L355. This is not correct as `raven-logback` nor its underlying library `raven` use Typesafe Config. Instead for `raven` the value must be set as a system property, or alternatively as a different environment variable. However the latest `sentry` library (and transitively `sentry-logback`) do allow code configuration via `Sentry.init`. **A/C:**; - Replace `raven-logback` dependency with `sentry-logback`; - ~Allow setting a `cromwell.sentry.*` stanza with Cromwell specific sentry configuration. Alternative namespaces could be `sentry.*` or `system.sentry.*`, but both namespaces may collide with other library/application configurations in the future!~; - ~Wire the `cromwell.sentry.*` HOCON fields into `Sentry.init`~; - ~Default the sentry DSN in `reference.c",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/3657:46,configurat,configuration,46,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/3657,2,['configurat'],['configuration']

The framing of the approach here, which is a bit broader than originally noted in CROM-6718, is:; Make call caching location-aware, prioritizing copies that minimize egress charges.; Add a workflow option enabling control of what egress charges can be incurred for call cache copying.; The new workflow option would be:. call_cache_egress: [none, continental, global]. where the values affect whether call cache copies can incur egress charges:; none: only within-region copies are allowed, which generate no egress charges; continental: within content copies are allowed; within-content copies have reduced costs, such as $0.01 / GB in the US; global: copies across all regions are allowed. Cross-content egress charges can be much higher (ranging from $0.08 / GB up to $0.23 / GB). ### CURRENT STATUS OF PR:; With the changes in this PR, Cromwell successfully checks the location of the source and destination file to be copied, compares the location, and makes a decision of whether or not it should be copied based on the call_cache_egress option.

Deployability,"From Henry --. My comment is a little different than the commenter above. So I will try to provide some context in order to differentiate. If one looks at Cromwell as being part of a larger application infrastructure/service such as a Genomics Pipeline where sequenced data is constantly being processed through the system or providing a service where users on the Internet can launch workflows ""as a Service"" - whenever they way. In these systems, uptime and availability are critical - at all times. Below are several scenarios where I could see running multiple Cromwells would be very beneficial. High availability:; Having multiple Cromwells running where jobs are ""load balanced"" between them would allow us to continue operate when there are systems issues or failures with one of the Cromwell instances. Zero-downtime deployments:; Supporting multiple Cromwells running different versions of the code, could provide the ability to upgrade Cromwell with little or no user impact. Essentially the new version is deployed to a new server, it is started up and at an appropriate time traffic (via a load balancer or proxy maybe) is directed away from the ""old version"" Cromwell to the new. Similar to item 2: being able to introduce infrastructure changes (host OS, security patches, host resizing,..) more seamlessly:; If I can support multiple instances of Cromwell, I can build a new instance of the host with all the updates and changes I require - deploy cromwell to the new node and cut over. A corollary to this request is also the ability to ""move"" workflows from one Cromwell instance to another. Maybe this is just workflows not in flight or active - but waiting to run. This capability could make it easier to retire older cromwell instances (once multiple cromwell instances support is in place). Some workflows may take days to run, being able to ""relocate"" these workflows to the ""new"" cromwell - allows us to decommission ""old"" cromwells faster.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/691:244,Pipeline,Pipeline,244,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/691,7,"['Pipeline', 'deploy', 'patch', 'update', 'upgrade']","['Pipeline', 'deploy', 'deployed', 'deployments', 'patches', 'updates', 'upgrade']"

Deployability,"Hello, I am running Cromwell 36 configured with the GCS/JES backend to run jobs on GCP. When running massive batches of workflows, I frequently encounter the IP-address quota from Google. To avoid this, I've reconfigured my default VPC to allow private google access (see #1325). I've added the following to my Cromwell configuration (other unrelated configuration entries removed):; ```; backend {; default = ""JES""; providers {; JES {; actor-factory = ""cromwell.backend.google.pipelines.v2alpha1.PipelinesApiLifecycleActorFactory""; config {; default-runtime-attributes {; noAddress: true; }; }; }; }; }; ```. This appears to have the desired effect, as my instances are now launching without an external IP, however, the jobs end up failing because docker cannot fetch the image `stedolan/jq` (as it resides on docker hub). Is there a way to configure Cromwell to use a different image for that pipeline action?. I could reconfigure the VPC to allow access to docker(hub), but that would require connecting a NAT instance which would increase the cost of using Cromwell. ---. Edit: Cromwell 36.

Deployability,"Hi Guys,. This is more of a question/request than a bug report. Apologies if this is not the place to ask. Im trying to run Cromwell with an AWS backend. A number of our workflows make extensive use of very large reference files. To avoid localising the same huge file over and over (wasting time and space) I want to copy these reference files to an additional volume during batch node initialisation and mount to each container (rather than using File arguments I would use a simple String argument to prevent localisation - I appreciate this is a hack). I am already doing this with a different pipeline framework with some success, however it requires the JobDefinition to specify the mount locations between the node(host) and job container. Is it possible to provide additional mount/volume instructions to the aws batch backend in the cromwell.conf?. If this is possible, I cannot see any specific examples in the Cromwell docs. If this is not currently possible, could I request adding the ability to define additional mount points as a feature request??.

Deployability,"Hi Guys. We are running pipelines through Cromwell on AWS Batch using S3 and have noticed some behaviour we didn't initially expect. We have a task that has quite a significant setup cost. As such we want to process a number of samples through this task rather than instantiating the task for every sample. We can then parallelise this task to process batches of samples. The task takes an Array of structs:. ```; struct Sample {; String id; File file1; File file2; }; ```. The struct is serialised to the task using write_json() and the tool consumes the resulting json before processing the samples one after the other. It is important that the output files can be matched back to their original inputs via the supplied id. The tool outputs a single file per sample to a directory and produces a reports.json that looks like:. ```; [; {; ""id"": ""1""; ""file"": ""outputs/report.txt""; },; ...; ]; ```. I was hoping we could use the read_json() function to parse the output.json into an array of the following struct:. ```; struct Report {; String id; File file; }; ```. and pass this to the next task (or drive a scatter) in the pipeline. However, the File objects parsed in this manner are not resolved to actual task outputs and neither have their address updated or delocalised at the end of the task. Conceptually, it seems like resolving Files within read_* generated structs would be handled the same way as raw File outputs. However, looking at how the delocalisation occurs in the Cromwell task script I understand why this would be difficult to implement. The wdl spec dose not specifically state that File outputs generated this way will be respected but then again it does not say that they won't. a) Could I put forward a feature request for the spec to detect File outputs generated from read_* functions and delocalise them?; b) Or put a note in the wdl/Cromwell spec that File objects generated from read_*() functions may not be detected in the output?.

Deployability,"Hi all,. As discussed with @TimothyTickle, @ruchim, @benjamincarlin, @gsaksena, @abaumann, @kshakir, @geoffjentry, and others at the Broad retreat and DSP holiday hackathon, we're putting a proposal for a new feature that reports task call resource utilization metrics to Stackdriver Monitoring API. This serves 2 important goals:. 1) Users can easily plot real-time resource usage statistics across all tasks in a workflow, or for a single task call across many workflow runs, etc. This can be very powerful to quickly determine outlier tasks that could use optimization, without the need for any configuration or code (or any changes to the workflow). It's also much easier than the current state-of-the-art, i.e. parsing task-level monitoring logs. 2) Scripts can easily get aggregate statistics on resource utilization and could produce suggestions based on those. This could provide a path towards automatic runtime configuration based on the models trained with historical data. One could also detect situations like out-of-memory calls and automatically adjust resources according to those. It would also be pretty easy to add logic for estimation of task call-level cost based on the pricing of associated resources. This could provide a long-sought feature of real-time cost monitoring/control (thanks to @TimothyTickle for the suggestion). Monitoring is done using the new ""monitoring action"" for PAPIv2, which currently uses the hard-coded [quay.io/broadinstitute/cromwell-monitor](https://quay.io/repository/broadinstitute/cromwell-monitor) image, built from https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell-monitor (I wasn't sure if that code belonged here or in a separate repo). This is advantageous to just using it as a _monitoring_script_, because it removes all assumptions on the ""user"" Docker image (for the task itself). For example, we don't have to assume a particular distribution or presence of Python and its libraries. So it should work exactly the same for any task.

So, if I submit a CWL with; ```; - class: ResourceRequirement; coresMin: 1; coresMax: 1; ramMin: 2000; ramMax: 2000; ```; The cromwell will send the command to SLURM with a ridiculously high value of memory; ```; executing: sbatch --nodes 1 --ntasks 1 \; --cpus-per-task=1 --mem-per-cpu=2097152000 \; ```; And most likely it will fail because we do not have such a beefy flavor node, since SLURM reads the memory in MB.; ```; sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested node configuration is not available; ```; More tests like using different units or numbers will lead to similar errors:; Submit; ```; - class: ResourceRequirement; coresMin: 1; coresMax: 1; ramMin: 2GB; ramMax: 2GB; ```; will give me; ```; executing: sbatch --nodes 1 --ntasks 1 \; --cpus-per-task=1 --mem-per-cpu=2000000000 \; ```; and; ```; - class: ResourceRequirement; coresMin: 1; coresMax: 1; ramMin: 2; ramMax: 2; ```; gives me; ```; executing: sbatch --nodes 1 --ntasks 1 \; --cpus-per-task=1 --mem-per-cpu=2097152 \; ```; more for; ``` - class: ResourceRequirement; coresMin: 1; coresMax: 1; ramMin: 2000MB; ramMax: 2000MB; ```; it will give; ```; executing: sbatch --nodes 1 --ntasks 1 \; --cpus-per-task=1 --mem-per-cpu=2000000000 \; ```. So, it seems cromwell will read the numbers in MB and transfer it in bytes to SLURM. However, SLURM probably needs memory in MB as well. (I assume it is a bug when mapping CWL resource key to WDL). Currently, I manage to use an expression in the config `memoryMin/1000000` to circumvent the issue.; I don't think it is a very major issue nor a complex one, so feel free to fix it whenever. The cromwell version is the latest release, cromwell-34, and please find my working config if necessary.

Deployability,"Hi all;; I'm running into a database write error on some systems. Similar to #3584, this does not cause the pipeline to stop, but is quite noisy and presumably affecting the ability to re-run and query run status.

Deployability,"Hi everyone, . When I use cromwell + PBS backend I found the way that jobs are scheduled has some differences from using PBS alone. For example, I have a pipeline of 2 steps, A-B, where B depends on A. Now I want to submit this pipeline for 2 times which will generate 4 jobs A1 B1 A2 B2. Let's assume the cluster only have resource to run one of the jobs at a time. . When I use PBS alone all of the 4 jobs will be in the queue, at the beginning A1 gets to run and the others waiting. When A1 is done B1, A2 both have a chance to run depending on the priority PBS assigns to them. So the order of the four jobs might be A1-B1-A2-B2 or A1-A2-B1-B2. When I use cromwell + PBS backend cromwell will first send A1 and A2 to the queue without B1 and B2 since they won't be ready to run until A1 and A2 are done. When A1 is done A2 gets to run because it's the only job in the queue while B1 is on its way to the queue. So in this case the order of these jobs can only be A1-A2-B1-B2. This is not big issue when there are only a few pipelines to run. However, when I have, say 100 such pipelines, B1 has to wait until A100 to finish since when A1 finishes A2-A99 are already in the queue waiting and B1 has just set off. This means the finishing time of pipeline1(A1-B1) will be affected a lot by the total number of pipelines submitted to cromwell engine. . Is there any way for cromwell to change this situation (like sending all jobs to the backend without blocking any of them)? I really don't want to wait until all ""A""s to finish to get the first result of submitted pipelines. Hope I have made this problem clear. I have read the documents of cromwell and googled quit a bit but didn't find any solution. . Any help would be appreciated!.

Using the newest version causes dependency clashes in the jar.; - Liquibase does not support a way for defining unique constraints when creating tables. Currently all tables get their contstaints added with addUniqueConstraint, however in SQLite constraints have to be defined at table creation. Foreign key constraints can be applied at table creation, so luckily there are no problems here.; - To solve the above problem I have a PR open at liquibase https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/1059. It may take some time before this is reviewed. Even after liquibase has the necessary support, it will take some time to make sure everything in cromwell works with this newest version of liquibase. So this will take some time.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/5490:257,install,installed,257,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/5490,1,['install'],['installed']
Deployability,"Hi!. First of all, thanks for merging the PR on the cached-copy localization strategy. We have been using at as a patch for about a month now in the LUMC on our SGE cluster. Since our cluster filesystem also interacts with Windows PC's which have a hard-link limit of 1024, the maximum hardlink limit on our cluster is set to 1000. Unfortunately we run into this limit fairly often when using the `cached-copy` strategy. When this happens cromwell will fallback to copying. This is good design, but unfortunately it uses a lot of disk space and takes a lot of time. This PR addresses that issue. When the hard-link limit is reached the hard-link in the cache will be removed. This hard-link will have pointed for example to inode 13820. Because there are plenty of hard-links still pointing to 13820, this inode is not removed, and all the jobs dependent on these files will still function.; Cromwell will copy the required file to the same path in the cache. This means the same path will now point to a different inode (for example: 13835). This inode has only 1 hardlink, so the hardlinking from this file in the cache can start with renewed vigor. Because the same path in the cache can be used, complex additional code in cromwell is not needed. Ideally I could get the maximum hard-link limit that Cromwell uses from the filesystem itself. But I could not find a way to do that. The limit is made to be configurable with a default of 950. Take the example case of having 9000 jobs that require the 3.8 GB reference genome, using a hard-link limit of 1000. Before this PR:. strategy | result; --- | ---; hard-link | fails when cromwell-executions is on a different disk. Allows up to 1000 hardlinks if on the same disk.; cached-copy | Allows up to 1000 hard-links regardless of which disk the original file is stored on.; soft-link | does not work with containers and is excluded.; copy | since hard-link or cached-copy can only handle a 1000 links, copy will be used 8000 times.

Deployability,"Hi,; ### TL;DR. **Cromwell should allow for the configuration of Docker resource / environment flags at run-time.**. ---. I have a use-case where I'd like to run Cromwell jobs in a cluster environment via Docker Swarm. Since Swarm doesn't require any additional configuration outside of standard `docker run` commands, it's trivial to distribute Cromwell jobs across Swarm nodes. However, Swarm provides a series of [filters](https://github.com/docker/swarm/tree/master/scheduler/filter) and constrains that control how the scheduler distributes containers to nodes. For example, I might be interested in limiting the execution of a Cromwell job to a specific region / datacenter. This requires you to specify filters in the `docker run` command with the environment flag, `-e`. For example, to run a container on Swarm nodes that run in the `us-east` region:. ```; › docker run -d --name my_image -e constraint:region!=us-east* my_container; ```. Obviously, this configuration should _not_ be managed in the WDL document. Instead, it would be great for the Cromwell command-line tool and REST API to support additional runtime options for specifying Docker environment variables. For example:. ```; › cromwell run --docker-env ""constraint:region!=us-east*"" my_workflow.wdl -; ```. > Hint: Docker supports daemon labels. In the above case, the workflow would; > execute on a Swarm node whose Docker daemon that was started with:; > ; > ```; > docker daemon --label region=us-east; > ```. As for the API, the POST action to `/api/workflows/:version` would allow for multiple Docker env strings. The other feature I would like to request is translating `memory` and `cpu` configuration options (at the task level) to Docker via `--memory` and `--cpuset-cpus` `docker run` flags, respectively. These options are currently only used for the JES backend, but it seems as though they can also be used for the Local backend if Docker is specified. So, to summarize:; 1.

Deployability,"Hi; We are trying to setup the cromwell + wdl for genomic analyses at the [National Computational Infrastructure HPC facility](https://nci.org.au/systems-services/peak-system/raijin/) in Australia. This HPC runs bespoke configured PBSPro. I have successfully managed to run ""hello world"" example workflow using the following configuration for the backend. However, I am unable to modify certain parameters as errors are thrown. . My current configuration is as follows:. ```; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int cpu = 1; Int memory = 1; String raijin_queue = ""express""; String walltime = ""01:00:00""; String jobfs = ""1GB""; String raijin_project_id = ""myproject""; """"""; #Submit string when there is no ""docker"" runtime attribute.; submit = """"""; qsub \; -V \; -N ${job_name} \; -o ${out}.qsub \; -e ${err}.qsub \; -l ncpus=${cpu} \; -l mem=${memory}""GB"" \; -l walltime=${walltime} \; -l jobfs=${jobfs} \; ${""-q "" + raijin_queue} \; -P ${raijin_project_id} \; ${script}; """"""; ```. My specific questions:. 1. I have tried `Float memory_gb = 1.0` as the runtime attribute and `${""-l mem="" + memory_gb + ""GB""}` as the submit string but this fails with `qsub: Illegal attribute or resource value Resource_List.mem` error. Could you please help me with the correct formatting of this attribute?

I would like to use `$PROJECT` environment variable as the default value for `raijin_project_id` runtime attribute so that each user can run the same workflow without modification within their allocated project. Is there a way to use environment variable in the config file? I tried ${?PROJECT} and ${PROJECT} as per the recommendations for HOCON but to no avail.

There is no additional configuration; required for the HTTP filesystem itself so adding HTTP filesystem support to a backend is a simple as; adding a reference to this filesystem within the backend's `filesystems` stanza. e.g. Cromwell's default `Local` shared filesystem; backend is configured like this (a PAPI version 2 backend would be configured in a similar way):_. ```; backend {; default = ""Local""; providers {; Local {; ...; config {; filesystems {; local {; ...; }; http { }; }; }; ...; }; ...; }; }; ```.

I realize I might be using Cromwell for things it was not supposed to do, but since it is so very slow I thought I might ask anyway. Just so you understand my application, I'm not running bioinformatics pipelines: I'm rather interested in using WDL instead of Makefiles to do various scientific calculations. It's often a bunch of relatively simple Python or R scripts that I want to connect in a chain, and then sweep some parameters, etc. While developing and debugging the workflows (the majority of the time) I have a need for running and re-running single tasks or small sub-workflows many times.

This works fine when using a custom runtime attribute to define the container and using the `submit` configuration. However, if the `docker` attribute and `submit-docker` configuration are used I run into a problem:; Cromwell will use `docker_cwd` (instead of `cwd`) in the call's script. `docker_cwd` however does not exist in the container and can therefore not be mounted (due to a lack of sudo rights), like you would normally do when using Docker. The result is that the job will fail because it can't find a folder that is referenced in the script. Is there some way for me to override the `docker_cwd` value in my backend configuration? I would prefer not to use the `submit` configuration, as not all tasks currently list a container, so I need the `submit` configuration for those tasks. <!--; Hi!

Deployability,"In DSDE methods, there are four backend configurations we would like to support.; - local w/ docker; - local w/o docker; - SGE (req: no docker); - JES (req: docker). But we would like to support these without having to change the WDL file itself. Currently, this is done with complex scripts that choose default options and application configurations. But perhaps there is an easier way... by parameterizing runtime attributes. I hear cromwell already supports that, except for the case where we do not want to run in docker at all (e.g. local w/o docker backends). Assuming that you can specify runtime parameters as part of a workflow. In other words, assuming that the following is valid:. ```wdl. workflow yo {; String msg; String docker_image. call task1 {; input:; msg=msg,; docker_image=docker_image; }; }. # Run a message in an arbitrary docker container (e.g. ""broadinstitute/eval-gatk-protected:crsp_validation_latest""); task task1 {; String msg; String docker_image; ; command {; echo ${msg}; } ; ; runtime {; docker: ""${docker_image}""; memory: ""1GB""; }; }; ```; ```; {; ""yo.msg"": ""foo""; ""yo.docker_image"": ""broadinstitute/eval-gatk-protected:crsp_validation_latest""; }; ```; The above WDL+json should work for JES and ""local w/ docker"" backends. However, to support local w/o docker, we need to be able to specify a ""null"" value, which cromwell will interpret as, ""do not use docker"" or ""docker was never specified"". For example:; ```; {; ""yo.msg"": ""foo""; ""yo.docker_image"": """"; }; ```; My understanding of cromwell is that this json + WDL above will cause a failure in cromwell. If this functionality already exists, please close this issue. This would make our WDLs more complicated, but it would increase flexibility and move runtime specification into the json file (which is easier than juggling default options).",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1804:40,configurat,configurations,40,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1804,2,['configurat'],['configurations']

This was preventing the `ExecutionStore` from detecting the `i = hello.out` expression as being runnable because it was looking for a `hello.out` node in `Done` state at index `n`, which doesn't exist since `call hello` is outside the scatter.; This PR changes that to use the `preserveIndexForOuterLookups ` value of the conditional / scatter instead, which in this case will be `false`, because the scatter node does set `preserveScatterIndex = false` to build its inner graph (in this case the if).",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/3158:5,configurat,configuration,5,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/3158,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

In a cluster environment, we have observed that this limits how quickly a task can execute when using a shared file system (NFS/Lustre/etc.) because these filesystems perform poorly with small reads and writes. In earlier versions of Cromwell, we worked around this by setting tmpDir within each task of the WDL to a path mounted on a local disk, but now the tmpDir variable seems to be set globally resulting in the local tmpDir variable getting overwritten. . We can modify the tmpDir path in StandardAsyncExecutionActor, but this requires recompiling Cromwell for each environment where Cromwell is deployed. Would it be possible to make the tmpDir variable configurable within reference.conf?

Deployability,"It would be nice if cromwell would have the option to incrementally increase the memory attribute for a job, based on the retries. This is related to #1991, but the conclusion there (if I'm understanding it correctly) seems to be adding a feature to the WDL specs. I feel that these types of features might be more appropriate as a backend configuration, since whether this is something you want to do or not will depend on the infrastucture your workflow is running on. One potential way to configure this, might be to add multipliers for certain runtime attributes in the backend configuration:; ```; [...]; config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int? cpu = 1; Int? memory = 4; """"""; runtime-attribute-retry-multipliers = {; memory: 1.5; }; [...]; }; [...]; ```. This would, for example, cause the memory attribute to be multiplied by `1.5` with each retry. For the first attempt it would be `4`, for the the second `6`, the third `9` etc. Another option might be that the values here indicate a fraction of the original attribute which it should be increased it by each retry, so in the above example it would be: `4` -> `10` -> `16` etc. You would probably want set a lower value in that case, though. Another option would be to supply a list of numbers with each indicating a multiplier for a certain attempt. A value of `[1.5, 2]` (or maybe `[1, 1.5, 2]`) would cause the value to be multiplied by `1.5` on the second attempt and `2` on the third, repeating the last multiplier if neccesary.

Deployability,"My group has been running Cromwell with AWS Batch as part of our pipeline development process and we've observed several cases of workflows ""silently"" failing where no Batch jobs have failed but the workflow log points to missing RC files. From our testing, this issue seems to affect ~10% of the samples that we try to process, although the issue appears ""randomly"" as there is no single set of samples that reproduces the error time after time. After digging through several logs, I believe I've traced the error to an issue where a batch job is being submitted, but it the service finds a previously run job that uses a completely different set of input files and runs that job instead. This incorrect job runs to completion, but the outputs are written to the location specified in the original job, hence that failure to read the RC file.

Deployability,"NOTE: I haven't 100% confirmed that the application.conf isn't auto-included, but since we now have separated cromwell into artifacts, based on the HOCON docs it does not appear that we're using an ""application.conf"" as intended: https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md#conventional-configuration-files-for-jvm-apps. If someone needs to specify a backend via a new application.conf, they shouldn't need to do one of the two current workarounds:. 1) Know to include the _original_ application.conf.; 2) Copy/paste all of the previous application.conf, including things like akka dispatcher executors. The fix is to rename the core/src/main/resources/{application.conf => reference.conf}. When one then adjusts settings while running the fat-jar, one definitely doesn't need to re-include a reference.conf. The ticket says ""most of?"" because there may be some elements of the current core/.../application.conf that would be more appropriate for a fat-jar _only_, such as having the main.hsqldb and an included Local backend.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1389:302,configurat,configuration-files-for-jvm-apps,302,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1389,1,['configurat'],['configuration-files-for-jvm-apps']
Deployability,"NOTE: This ticket refinement will require work with Google/Verily. Currently at the start of a call a PAPI-client must register a path to be delocalized via [`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/reference/rest/v1alpha2/pipelines#pipelineparameter). The PAPI `gsutil cp` does not use [`-r`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/cp#description), so it does not work for nested directories. For POSIX-globs the cromwell ~~JES~~ PAPI backend is able to delocalize by creating a new folder containing matches of each of the outputs. We could try to flatten a directory in the same way to delocalize all the files nested inside the top level directory, but ideally we would maintain the paths to the directories. For example if a WDL command were to create a structure like:; ```; out/normal/sample.bam; out/tumor/sample.bam; ```. Even using our globs with `Array[File] bams = glob(""out/*/sample.bam"")` would cause problems right now with the way we flatten globs into a single directory. Cromwell creates a directory (sort-of) named `out/cromwell-glob-1/`, and then hard links in each of the `sample.bam` files. This won't work with the aforementioned glob as >1 file match the same name and will collide in the links. A/C: Delocalize globs and nested-directories with paths-in-the-cloud similar to the path-generated-by-the-command. A test should be created to ensure that a collision like the above delocalizes correctly. This will like require updates to the PAPI API, possibly even an implementation of a custom (de-)localizer in cromwell.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/3173:226,pipeline,pipelines,226,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/3173,3,"['pipeline', 'update']","['pipelineparameter', 'pipelines', 'updates']"

Deployability,"OS: **Centos 7**; Cromwell version: **cromwell 86** installed from conda-forge; Backend: **SFS**. Hello,. I'm configuring Cromwell to run on my group's SLURM cluster, and struggling to make `cpu`/`memory` runtime attributes optional. I believe this is supported because the ""Getting started on HPC Clusters"" documentation shows `memory_gb` as an optional `runtime-attribute`: https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/tutorials/HPCIntro/. ```; backend.providers.SGE.config {; runtime-attributes = """"""; Int cpu = 1; Float? memory_gb; String? sge_queue; String? sge_project; """"""; }; ```. My intent is for the user to only provide arguments for `cpu`, `memory`, `runtime_minutes`, and `partition` if they intend to override the SLURM cluster's defaults. I do not want to have cromwell supply defaults, because if these arguments are omitted from the call to `sbatch` then the cluster's defaults will be used. My understanding is that making them optional like `String? memory_mb` and then using syntax like `${""--mem "" + round(memory_mb) + ""m""} \` in the submit script means that argument will only be added if `memory` is defined, and will be omitted if `memory` is not defined. I've followed the documentation as closely as I can. However, when I try to submit a test job without `cpu` and `memory` set as a runtime attribute, I get a failure with these exceptions:; ```; cromwell.core.CromwellAggregatedException: Initialization Failure:; Runtime validation failed:; 	Task myTask has an invalid runtime attribute cpu = !!

There was a bug in the v2alph1 backend where it was ignoring the disk type requested. I fixed it and pushed it out. The diskType in v2alpha1 is the standard GCE names (so in this case, pd-ssd) - in v1 they were a custom enumeration. This will probably require a cromwell change depending on where that value is coming from (eg, maybe it's in the WDL file itself?); I think we're translating it from WDL-speak. Where can I find the ""standard GCE names"" (e.g. ""pd-ssd""). ""gcloud compute disk-types list"" shows the full per-zone list, but in practice it's really just one of ""pd-ssd, pd-standard or local-ssd"".; ; and would it become ""zones/us-central1-b/diskTypes/pd-ssd"" or just ""pd-ssd"" ?.

Also, tagging you because I suspect you might be the resident expert here :) ), and the previous fix (using the ecs proxy image) was supposedly obsoleted.; > ; > I also see that the s3fs library appears to be vendored into cromwell, and after digging around, it appears that one might be able to set retries via an environment variable(?). But even then, I feel like if that were to work, it would be much nicer if it was configurable through cromwell's config file somehow.; >; > So that brings me to my final question. Is there some configuration that allows me to retry failed downloads some number of times before failing the whole job?

Deployability,"Our Green friends are regularly seeing cases where Cromwell reports a workflow's `status` as `On Hold` but follow-on calls to `releaseHold` return a 403 HTTP status. This appears to be happen because `status` queries go to the potentially laggy workflow summary table but `releaseHold` goes straight to the workflow store. Cromwell [returns 403](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/engine/src/main/scala/cromwell/webservice/routes/CromwellApiService.scala#L148) if the workflow for which `releaseHold` is invoked is [in the workflow store but not in `On Hold` or `Submitted`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/blob/develop/engine/src/main/scala/cromwell/engine/workflow/workflowstore/SqlWorkflowStore.scala#L140) status. . 403 seems like a strange HTTP status to return in this case. If the thought was ""the workflow has to be on hold to be able to release the hold"" then we would also return 403 for workflows found in `Submitted`, but we don't; those get a 200.

Deployability,"PR Documentation describing the SparkBackend added to Cromwell. This PR adds support for execution of spark jobs as task in a workflow using the existing wdl format, with restrictions on the environment like having a local file system, a shared file system or a network file system when running a spark job in the spark standalone cluster mode. This implementation takes a wdl with the backend configuration specified as ""Spark"" and then generates the appropriate spark commands and monitoring process to ensure the job runs to completion. Meaning, details of the spark internals are completely abstracted from the user provided backends with different configurations containing different flavours of { master and deployMode } combinations are already set. Internally, we create a bash script containing a spark-submit (depending on the backend flavour selected at runtime) command using all the specified wdl runtime attributes which is then executed by Spark.  .

Note: This is only the case when the spark job writes the output to an hdfs location. Then cromwell cannot find the output file for evaluation.   In the near **Future**, we plan to provide an hdfs client similar to that of the gcs to add support for the hdfs, primarily bec",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/1339:394,configurat,configuration,394,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/1339,3,"['configurat', 'deploy']","['configuration', 'configurations', 'deployMode']"

Deployability,"Path+modtime should guarantee that files are the same. . I have expanded the SFS test scala file so it properly tests the new `cached-inputs` strategy. I have added information on how to use the strategy in the docs, and added this PR to the changelog. ### Help still needed. There are two things that I could not figure out without cromwell developer help:. ~~* Checking whether a file exists and copying it to the cache should never be done by multiple threads simeltaneously. I have used the `synchronized` method to prevent this. I used an object for this, because I am sure it is unique within the JVM at cromwell runtime. This works fine, but I can imagine this can be solved in a nicer way using akka? However the akka documentation is an extensive jungle on its own, and requires quite some expertise to navigate. I could not find very quickly what I needed, and the `synchronization` primitive works fine. It is also **just 2 lines of extra code**. So if the akka solution is quite elegant as well I would like to learn about that. If not, well, it is not too bad having 2 lines of understandable commented code that is not ""the proper way of doing things(TM)"".~~. * I used the SFS scalatests to make sure everything worked correctly. However this did not test whether the thread safety was working correctly. I have added a test wdl in centaur: `standardTestCases/cached_copy/cached_copy.wdl`. This workflow creates 10 jobs that read the same input file. This workflow will crash if the `cached-inputs` cache is not used in a thread-safe way. I tested this manually with `java -Dbackend.providers.Local.config.filesystems.local.localization.0=""cached-copy"" -jar server/target/scala-2.12/cromwell-41-*-SNAP.jar run centaur/src/main/resources/standardTestCases/cached_copy/cached_copy.wdl` . Is there a way to integrate such a test in scalatest file? I have tried the `.par` method, but that did not quite work. I hope you will consider this PR as it solves an important issue for us.

Deployability,"Per discussion in https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/4039, it would be nice and clean to have different backend providers defined in an examples folder. The user:. - should more easily be able to inspect one backend, as it's not lost in a huge commented file; - from each backend example, a link to the docs (if they exist) should be provided; - per the files being separate, we don't ask the user to uncomment a million lines to use a backend (copy pasta, done). But given separation from the examples configuration file, we need to compensate by having really good instructions for doing this (I will write a nice README). I think this is the right way to go because it will more cleanly show the various backends that Cromwell provides, and how to use.

Sources of noise:. 1. `Traversable` and the whole `Traversable` family are gone.; 2. Stronger opinions about the presence of absence of parens in function invocations.; 3. `scala.collection.JavaConverters` moved to `scala.jdk.CollectionConverters`; 4. `MapView` introduced with some breaking changes to the usage of maps; 5. Conversion of `Array` to `IndexedSeq` now has to be explicit; 6. Instances of `case` matches being incomplete are now detected where previously they were not; 7. Right-biasing of `Either`s makes for a lot of annoying `toOption` / `swap` instead of `right` / `left`; 8. Type ascriptions required for some anonymous functions; 9. Explicit `.` now required for some method invocations; 10. `Stream` is no more, long live `LazyList`; 11. `Symbol` literal `'` syntax no longer supported; 12. etc etc",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6724:11,upgrade,upgrade,11,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/6724,1,['upgrade'],['upgrade']

Deployability,"So far cromwell is working great on our cluster. Thanks a lot for this splendid effort. However there is one issue we run into that other people might run into as well. Our cluster uses NFS as its filesystem backend. This means that if one node completes a job, it might take a while before the files that were created. In other workflows we can set an I/O timeout option: if the file did not appear within 3 minutes, the job failed. How do we do this in cromwell. All the settings I have available is `number-of-requests`, `per` and `number-of-attempts`. Currently we have; ```HOCON; io {; number-of-requests = 10; per = 10 seconds; number-of-attempts = 180; }; ```; This should make sure that failing files are attempted for 180 seconds, but this is not very elegant. There is a `timeout` option in I/O. But this is the timeout for the I/O operation to respond. If the file is not ""visible"" then the I/O operation will respond immediately, and the job will have failed. Is there a fix to this option in the current cromwell configuration?",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/3648:1026,configurat,configuration,1026,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/3648,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

There was one line of code that actively prohibited namespaced inputs. Removing this line allows namespaced inputs again.

Deployability,"The `DrsCloudNioFileSystemProvider` was wrapping the retries of the `DrsPathResolver` with another set of `CloudNioRetry` retries. The product of these two retries at the previous configuration values would wait around 35 minutes (~:20 + 10 x ~3:30) to fail for each doomed attempt. That combined with a fairly wide scatter and a typo'd DRS path for `file` in code like . ```; task size {; input {; File file; }.

They look like this:. ```; dockerAccount = ""my.docker@account.com""; dockerToken = ""mydockertoken""; ```. If they are specified a ""docker"" value will be added to gcloudauth.json containing those values.; This will allow using a private docker image that would not be accessible otherwise.; This functionality was mostly already there from Kristian PR, I just moved the credential location from gcs to conf.; - User credentials: These need to be added as workflow options : . ```; {; ""account_name"": ""myaccount@broadinstitute.org"",; ""refresh_token"": ""refresh_token""; }; ```. Again if in RefreshToken mode, they need to be there for every workflow call or an exception will be thrown at initialization time.; If they are there they will be added to the gcloudauth.json in the same way docker crednetials are, under a ""gcloud"" value. You should then get permission to localize input files that are only accessible to this user.

This is not so good as `==` in Scala does a deep equals, and the `Scope` implementations are case classes with compiler-generated `equals` and `hashCode` implementations. These implementations invoke `equals`/`hashCode` on their constructor fields, including `Task` which contains a lot of hairy stuff including ASTs. This is extra bad in `WorkflowExecutionActor` since these `==`s are invoked synchronously with message processing to update the execution store, and all this computation is effectively single-threaded within a workflow.

But this seriously needs refactoring:; 1. Proper concurrency handling for store updates. The current code is awful, the mutable stores are just passed around the various concurrently executing actors. Probably the stores should be behind an actor which the CallActor and WorkflowActor would `ask` for queries or updates, and then compose a `pipeTo` with the `Future` response.; 2. While the potential parallelism of the cgrep and wc calls does appear to work as intended, the current test does not assert this.; 3. The call dependency determination only works for member access expressions and is kind of gross.; 4.

Deployability,"This proposal should give us more flexibility regarding docker tags while keeping the call caching safety on false positive / negative. Docker runtime attributes with docker hashes do not need any additional processing. All logic in this ticket applies to docker runtime attributes with a ""floating"" tag, which will be referred as ""tag"" in this issue. In all cases, if Cromwell fails to retrieve the docker hash for a task, for any reason, the corresponding call(s) will NOT be eligible for call caching, neither read nor write, regardless of the call caching configuration in effect. **When to get the hashes and what to do with them:**. 1. Cromwell will lookup the hashes corresponding to docker tags, for all docker attributes in all tasks in a workflow and its subworkflows, at Materialization time.; If the runtime attribute value can't be determined, the task in question will be ineligible for call caching. The only case when that should be true is if the attribute is an expression with variables depending on previous tasks being run. 2. If the hash lookup succeed, Cromwell will use that hash to perform any call cache read / write according to the call caching configuration in effect. It will also provide that hash, along with the original floating tag, to the backend when the job gets dispatched. 3. Backends will choose wether to use the hash or the floating tag. They will report to the engine which one they used, so that the engine can send this information to the metadata. **How to get the hash:**. 1. How to get the hash depends on the backend. Which means, at this time, that only workflows for which the backend is known statically at workflow submission time will be supported. 2. If the task is expected to run on the **Local Backend**, Cromwell will attempt to find the hash corresponding to the tag on the machine where it's being run.

Deployability,"This pull request will trigger CI to run for the newly added configuration. . ## What does it do?; Specifically, this test builds and deploys a docker development container with sbt and scala to build cromwell. . ## How is it tested?; The user is instructed to bind the source code with ""sbt assembly"" in the `/code` directory in the container after binding the root of this repository to `/code`. Since we cannot have volumes in circle, we instead just test the added code to the container, also located at `/code`. Since the purpose of this container is to be a clean slate with sbt, scala to build cromwell, the primary test that is important is ensuring that `sbt assembly` runs successfully without a hitch. Any other ""docker"" tests for the actual cromwell (not building it) would not belong here, but with Docker containers meant to deploy cromwell proper. # Where does it deploy?; The container will deploy to the `CONTAINER_NAME` defined in the circle environment settings (or in the circle config at `.circleci/config.yml`. By default, it will be tagged with the commit first 10 characters, and then latest, and you can change this behavior by defining `DOCKER_TAG` either in the config or circle environment (I don't see a reason to do this).

Deployability,This reworks the JES Authentication schema in such a way that:; - All JES calls (launching a VM) are requested using the Cromwell Service Account (CSA) passed in through the configuration.; - The upload / delete of the authentication file to GCS is also done using CSA.; - All other GCS interactions are done using the user's credentials (with refresh token coming from WF options + clientID/secrets in the conf).; - a `billing_bucket` workflow option has been added that sets the gcs path where cromwell will write the auth.json file,MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/295:174,configurat,configuration,174,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/pull/295,1,['configurat'],['configuration']
Deployability,"This sets up a mechanism to:; 1) Collect information about ""load"" from various part of the system; 2) Summarize this information and calculate a global load; 3) Notify parts of the system of changes in the global load. Current implementation is simple:; Only 2 load levels: `NormalLoad` and `HighLoad`; Actors reporting their load are:; - WriteMetadataActor; - JobStoreReadActor; - JobStoreWriteActor; - CallCacheWriteActor; - CallCacheReadActor; - KeyValueReadActor; - KeyValueWriteActor; - IoActor; - JesAPIQueryManagerActor. Additionally free memory is also being monitored and will go to `HighLoad` if going below a certain threshold. Global load == max(all load levels). So if one actor or more say their load is high, the global load will be high, otherwise normal.; The only actor listening to changes on the global load is the job token dispenser. It will stop dispensing tokens when load is high and start again when load is back to normal. At the exception of the IoActor, all the above mentioned actors have a queue in which they store work to be done. Their load is determined by comparing the size of this queue to a threshold.; The IoActor's queue is not easily accessible because hidden in the stream implementation and its size cannot easily be known. However we know when its full because we can't add to it anymore (this is when backpressure messages are sent). When that happens the IO actor reports its load to be `High`. When it hasn't had to backpressure for 10 seconds, the load returns to normal. There are many ways this could be made smarter but it already yields improvements in terms of stability and robustness.

Deployability,"This ticket is a reminder to discuss what @cjllanwarne was saying Friday afternoon. I don't believe this is a release blocker, but noting it for future consideration:. The interplay between restart and caching is possibly not ideal. When restarting with cache read turned on, Cromwell will begin potentially expensive hash calculations on jobs that may have previously been running. However, Cromwell currently does this calculation before checking if jobs were actually running and recoverable, which if they were would make hash calculation unnecessary. . On the other hand, perhaps determining whether a job is running in the backend is more expensive than calculating hashes. Shrug. . Anyway, the current scheme is likely more accidental than intentional and would benefit from some discussion.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,cromwell,87,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1441:110,release,release,110,https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/,https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues/1441,1,['release'],['release']
