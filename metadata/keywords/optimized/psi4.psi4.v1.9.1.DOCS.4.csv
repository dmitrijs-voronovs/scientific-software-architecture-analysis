The above example also shows the total memory for the computation being; set in |PSIfour| format. See :ref:`sec:memory` for details. When; specified, the memory value is passed on to Cfour by setting keywords; |cfour__cfour_memory_size| and |cfour__cfour_mem_unit|\ =MB. |PSIfour| has an extensive :ref:`basis set library <apdx:basisElement>` in; Gaussian94 format. See :ref:`sec:basisSets` for details. Contrasts to; Cfour basis handling include identifying basis sets by standard name; (aug-cc-pVDZ instead of AUG-PVDZ), direct handles for; diffuse-function-pruned sets (*e.g.*, jun-cc-pVDZ), case insensitivity,; appropriate setting of spherical/Cartesian depending on basis set design,; and syntax to set different basis sets to different classes of atoms; without listing each atom. All of these features are available to Cfour by; using the |mints__basis| keyword instead of |cfour__cfour_basis|; (accompanied, of course, by specifying the molecule |PSIfour|-style).; Internally, |PSIfour| processes the basis set as usual, then translates; the basis set format and writes out a ``GENBAS`` file with an entry for; each atom. The P4C4 interface sets keyword |cfour__cfour_basis|\ =SPECIAL; and |cfour__cfour_spherical| as appropriate, then writes the basis section; necessary for SPECIAL below the ``*CFOUR(...)`` block. (I'm sorry that the; name of the basis doesn't appear in ``ZMAT``, but the combination of the; ~14 character basis name limit and the absence of a comment line marker; rather precludes that helpful label.).

Python Wrappers; ===============. The Python foundations of the |PSIfour| driver and Psithon syntax permit; many commonly performed post-processing procedures to be integrated into; the |PSIfour| suite. . As seen in the neon dimer example from the :ref:`tutorial <sec:tutorial>` section,; the :py:func:`~psi4.driver.driver_nbody.nbody` wrapper provides automatic computation of; counterpoise-corrected interaction energies between two molecules. For; example, ::. energy('mp2', bsse_type='cp'). will compute the counterpoise-corrected density-fitted MP2 interaction energy; between two molecules. |PSIfour| also provides the :py:func:`~psi4.driver.cbs` wrapper,; which automatically computes a complete-basis-set extrapolation (and; automatically sets up the computations with different basis sets required to; do the extrapolation). For example,::. # all equivalent. energy('mp2', corl_basis='cc-pv[dt]z', corl_scheme=corl_xtpl_helgaker_2). energy('mp2/cc-pv[dt]z'). will compute a 2-point Helgaker extrapolation of the correlation energy; using the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets (with method MP2) and add this; extrapolated correlation energy to the Hartree--Fock energy in the; largest basis (cc-pVTZ). :py:func:`~psi4.driver.cbs` can; be configured behind-the-scenes with explicit arguments, as in the; first example, or the convenience syntax of the equivalent second; example can be used. Another very useful and powerful feature of |PSIfour| is the ability; to compute results on entire databases of molecules at a time,; as provided by the :py:func:`~psi4.driver.wrapper_database.database` wrapper. For example,::. database('mp2', 'S22', cp=1, benchmark='S22B'). will perform DF-MP2 counterpoise-corrected interaction energies; (``c",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/psithoninput.rst:15706,wrap,wrapper,15706,doc/sphinxman/source/psithoninput.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/psithoninput.rst,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']

Integrability,"=. To simplify parsing of options and handling of defaults, the Options class; was created. It functions in the following way:. - Each module (or plugin) declares which options it will look for in the; input: their name, type (string, int, double, array, etc.), and any; default value they take. - The input is parsed for these options, and defaults are assigned for; those keywords not specified by the user. - The c-side module or plugin can then query the Options object for the; values associated with each keyword. - The options will also be accessible py-side to the procedures that drive; the modules. Array-type options are not available in python. Declaring Options; -----------------. Each module needs to make itself known to the Options object, via a; read_options section.

Integrability,"One of the most significant changes introduced in version 4 was the use of; Python. The input file is actually a Python script, which interacts with a Psi; Python module to perform computations. In order for this to happen, the C++; binding must be known to Python; this is all done in the ; {\tt \$PSI4/src/bin/psi4/python.cc} file. For example, we have an SCF module, with; the C++ signature; {\tt PsiReturnType cscf::cscf(Options \&options);}; To allow Python to use this, we first define a little wrapper function; \begin{verbatim}; double py_psi_scf(); {; if (scf::scf(Process::environment.options) == Success); return Process::environment.globals[""CURRENT ENERGY""];; else; return 0.0;; }; \end{verbatim}; This does a couple of things to automate things a) it passes the default; options object into SCF automatically, so that the user doesn't have to, and b); checks the return value, and will return the energy, which is posted to the; globals map, back to Python. Note that this is C++ code, within \PSIfour\ so; it is aware of all global objects, such as PSIO, Chkpt and Options. Now we; have this simple function call, we can tell Python about it:; \begin{verbatim}; def(""scf"", py_psi_scf);; \end{verbatim}; This binds the keyword ``scf'' to the newly created wrapper function, allowing; the user to type ``scf()'' in their Python input file to fire up the SCF; module. Similarly, the user might want to be able to call {\tt Molecule}'s; member functions directly from Python.

Managed Methods; ---------------. There are several conditions when a method and derivative combination should be *managed*:. * when functionality overlaps between modules, a pattern is needed to; access each route through the code;. * when functionality doesn't overlap completely, a pattern is needed to apportion defaulting among; the modules, taking into account reference (RHF/UHF/ROHF), calc type (CONV/DF/CD), and possibly; |globals__freeze_core| state (AE/FC). * for higher-level derivatives, when, say, gradient functionality for mtd+ref+type+fcae doesn't; exactly match energy functionality, a pattern is needed to decide analytic vs. finite difference. * when default type is not available for a method (e.g., CCD governed by |globals__cc_type| that; defaults to ``CONV`` but only ``DF`` and ``CD`` CCD is available), an informative error message is needed. Managed methods handle these cases through the addition of a new; keyword |globals__qc_module| and a set of type keywords analogous to; |globals__mp2_type|: |globals__mp_type|,; |globals__ci_type|, |globals__cc_type|, which can have values ``CONV``,; ``DF``, and ``CD``. These are all *global* keywords, as their values are; shared among modules rather than (or in addition to) being used internally; by the module).

Integrability,"^^^^^^^^^. All standard LAPACK 3.2 double precision routines are provided. LAPACK commands remain in Fortran's ""column-major"" indexing, so all the; results will be transposed, and leading dimensions may have to be fiddled; with (using ``lda = n`` in both directions for square matrices is highly; recommended). An example of the former problem is a Cholesky; Decomposition: you expect to get back a lower triangular matrix L such; that ``L L^T = A``, but this is returned in column-major order, so the actual; recovery of the matrix A with the row-major BLAS wrappers effectively; involves ``L^T L = A``. On of the biggest consequences is in linear equations:; The input/output forcing/solution vector must be explicitly formed in; column-major indexing (each vector is placed in a C++ row, with its; entries along the C++ column). This is visualized in C++ as the transpose; of the forcing/solution vector. All routines are declared in qt.h. Each; routine is prefixed with a ``C_``, followed by the standard Fortran name of; the routine, in capital letters. Input parameters of single primitives; (int, double, unsigned long int, char, ...) are passed by value. Arrays,; including multidimensional arrays, are required to be in contiguous memory; (as provided by block_matrix, for example), and are passed by providing a; pointer to the first double or int element of the data (this is array[0]; if array is ``double**``). All routines return an int INFO with error and; calculation information specific to the routine, In Fortran, this is the; last argument in all LAPACK calls, but should not be provided as an; argument here. For char arguments, case is insensitive. A Cholesky; transform example is shown::. // BLAS/LAPACK; #include ""psi4/libqt/qt.h""; // block_matrix, init_array; #include ""psi4/libciomr/libciomr.h""; ; using namespace psi;; ...; int n = 100;; ; // Allocate A matrix;; double** A = block_matrix(n,n);; ; // Call the LAPACK DPOTRF to get the Cholesky factor; // Note this works i",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/prog_blas.rst:6341,rout,routine,6341,doc/sphinxman/source/prog_blas.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/prog_blas.rst,2,['rout'],['routine']

Now we; have this simple function call, we can tell Python about it:; \begin{verbatim}; def(""scf"", py_psi_scf);; \end{verbatim}; This binds the keyword ``scf'' to the newly created wrapper function, allowing; the user to type ``scf()'' in their Python input file to fire up the SCF; module. Similarly, the user might want to be able to call {\tt Molecule}'s; member functions directly from Python. This can also be done easily:. \begin{verbatim}; class_<Molecule, shared_ptr<Molecule> >(""Molecule"").; def(""print_to_output"", &Molecule::print).; def(""nuclear_repulsion_energy"", &Molecule::nuclear_repulsion_energy);; \end{verbatim}. This first defines the keyword {\tt Molecule} to refer to the C++ {\tt; Molecule}; the {\tt shared\_ptr<Molecule>} keyword tells Python to store it as; a shared pointer, which ensures that the object will not be deleted until both; C++ and Python have no more references to it. The member functions to be bound; are then specified by a chained sequence of {\tt def} calls (note the periods),; terminated by a semicolon. Then, if the user had defined a molecule called; ``water'', they could print its geometry simp",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/attic/progpycppconnect.rst:1270,wrap,wrapper,1270,doc/sphinxman/source/attic/progpycppconnect.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/attic/progpycppconnect.rst,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']

Unfortunately, no; simple set of necessary and sufficient N-representability conditions are known,; and some of the known conditions are not easily imposed.

The crossover; point between DF-MP2 and DLPNO-MP2 depends on details of both the calculation and; the hardware, but can be as low as 2,000 basis functions. * The accuracy of DLPNO-MP2 (relative to DF-MP2) can be controlled with the; |dlpno__pno_convergence| keyword according to recommendation by Liakos et al.; [Liakos:2015:1525]_. For non-covalent interactions ``TIGHT`` is highly recommended. ; ; * The greater the spatial sparsity of a molecular system, the smaller the pair; domains and consequently the faster the calculation. DLPNO-MP2 is much faster; for linear alkanes than for globular proteins, all else constant. * Similar to molecular sparsity, the sparsity of the orbital basis affects runtime.; Diffuse functions increase the size of the pair domains and therefore lead to ; longer calculations. * All aspects of DLPNO-MP2 run in core; no disk is required. As a result, the; code exhibits very good intra-node parallelism, and benefits from many threads.; The amount of memory needed scales linearly with system size. * DLPNO-MP2 is not symmetry aware.

Some authors advocate a static range-separation parameter; determined by optimization over a test set of chemical systems. However, a more; physically-motivated and often more accurate approach is the idea of ""gap; fitting"" or ""optimal tuning"" or simply ""tuning."" The most popular tuned-LRC; approach is IP-fitting, in which the :math:`\omega` is varied until the; Koopman's IP (the opposite of the HOMO energy) matches the true IP (the; difference between :math:`N-1`\ -electron and :math:`N`\ -electron total; energies), within the LRC functional ansatz.

IP-tuned LRC functionals effectively pin the chemical potential at :math:`N`; electrons to the correct value determined by the ionization potential. This; often cleans up the MSIE problem for a surprisingly large number of high-lying; occupied orbitals, as determined by fractional particle curves.

Because of the limitations on geometry specification for; optimizations in Cfour, optking-driven optimizations are the *only*; optimizations allowed in the P4C4 interface. (The exception is sandwich; mode, which, of course, permits optimizations with the Cfour optimizer.); Below is an example of a geometry optimization::. memory 200 mb; ; molecule {; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; ; R=0.958; A=104.5; }; ; set {; ; cfour_CALC_level CCSD(T); cfour_BASIS DZP; cfour_CC_CONV 12; cfour_LINEQ_CONV 12; cfour_SCF_CONV 12; g_convergence cfour; }. optimize('cfour').

Setting; |optking__g_convergence|\ =CFOUR provides a good imitation of Cfour; default convergence criteria. Although Cfour produces gradients only in; its standard orientation and atom ordering, these are transformed back to; input orientation by the P4C4 interface.

BLAS commands involving matrices are wrapped so as to be conventional; C-style ""row-major"" indexing, meaning that the column is the fast index; like normal. * The calls to BLAS1 routines are wrapped so as to allow for operations on; vectors with more than 2^{31} elements (~16 GB, getting to be a problem).; So passing a signed or unsigned long works, though the stride arguments; must be integers. * All routines are declared in ``qt.h``. Each routine is prefixed with a; ``C_``, followed by the standard Fortran name of the routine, in capital; letters. Input parameters of single primitives (``int``, ``double``,; ``unsigned long int``, ``char``, ...) are passed by value. Arrays,; including multidimensional arrays, are required to be in contiguous; memory (as provided by block_matrix, for example), and are passed by; providing a pointer to the first double or int element of the data (this; is array[0] if array is ``double**``).

In COSX, numerical integration is performed on standard; DFT quadrature grids, which are described in :ref:`sec:dft`.; Both the accuracy of the COSX algorithm and also the computational; cost are directly determined by the size of the integration grid, so selection; of the grid is important. This COSX implementation uses two separate grids.; By default, the SCF algorithm is first converged on a smaller grid, followed by a; number of SCF iterations up to a maximum value (controlled by the |scf__cosx_maxiter_final| keyword); on a larger grid. By default, |scf__cosx_maxiter_final| is set to 1, a single; SCF iteration, which results in numerical errors comparable to; performing the entire SCF on the expensive larger grid at a computational cost; much closer to the smaller grid. Setting |scf__cosx_maxiter_final| to 0 disables the; larger grid entirely. Setting |scf__cosx_maxiter_final| to -1 allows; for the SCF to fully converge on the larger grid, useful for the study of wavefunction; properties such as gradients.

This bottleneck no longer exists, so these; extra transformation steps have been removed as part of the switch to Libint2,; and the affected codes (PCM and CPPE interfaces) now compute the potential and; field integrals in the representation required by the basis set. Also, note that the way external point charges are specified has changed.; Previously, a set of N external point charges would be specified by passing a; matrix with dimensions N rows and 4 columns -- corresponding to charge, x, y, z; -- to the ``set_charge_field()`` member of the potential integral class. The; same information is now passed using the more verbose; ``std::vector<std::pair<double, std::array<double, 3>>>`` type instead, to be; consistent with Libint2's convention.

The following examples demonstrate some of the ways; that global keywords can be specified::. # all equivalent. set globals basis cc-pVDZ. set basis cc-pVDZ. set globals basis = cc-pVDZ. set basis = cc-pVDZ. set globals{; basis cc-pVDZ; }; ; set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }; ; set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; }. Note the lack of quotes around ``cc-pVDZ``, even though it is a string. The; Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in ``set`` commands in; strings. The last three examples provide a more convenient way for specifying; multiple keywords::. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; print = 1; reference = rhf; }.

An example of the former problem is a Cholesky; Decomposition: you expect to get back a lower triangular matrix L such; that ``L L^T = A``, but this is returned in column-major order, so the actual; recovery of the matrix A with the row-major BLAS wrappers effectively; involves ``L^T L = A``. On of the biggest consequences is in linear equations:; The input/output forcing/solution vector must be explicitly formed in; column-major indexing (each vector is placed in a C++ row, with its; entries along the C++ column). This is visualized in C++ as the transpose; of the forcing/solution vector. All routines are declared in qt.h. Each; routine is prefixed with a ``C_``, followed by the standard Fortran name of; the routine, in capital letters. Input parameters of single primitives; (int, double, unsigned long int, char, ...) are passed by value. Arrays,; including multidimensional arrays, are required to be in contiguous memory; (as provided by block_matrix, for example), and are passed by providing a; pointer to the first double or int element of the data (this is array[0]; if array is ``double**``).

BLAS commands involving matrices are wrapped so as to be conventional; C-style ""row-major"" indexing, meaning that the column is the fast index; like normal. * The calls to BLAS1 routines are wrapped so as to allow for operations on; vectors with more than 2^{31} elements (~16 GB, getting to be a problem).; So passing a signed or unsigned long works, though the stride arguments; must be integers. * All routines are declared in ``qt.h``. Each routine is prefixed with a; ``C_``, followed by the standard Fortran name of the routine, in capital; letters. Input parameters of single primitives (``int``, ``double``,; ``unsigned long int``, ``char``, ...) are passed by value. Arrays,; including multidimensional arrays, are required to be in contiguous; memory (as provided by block_matrix, for example), and are passed by; providing a pointer to the first double or int element of the data (this; is array[0] if array is ``double**``). BLAS1 routines occasionally; return values (DDOT for instance), BLAS2 and BLAS3 always return void.; For char arguments, case is insensitive.",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/prog_blas.rst:2355,wrap,wrapped,2355,doc/sphinxman/source/prog_blas.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/prog_blas.rst,1,['wrap'],['wrapped']

Integrability,"fying some of the example input files supplied with |PSIfour|; in the :source:`samples` directory. Suppose you want to do a limited potential energy surface scan, such as; computing the interaction energy between two neon atoms at various; interatomic distances. One simple but unappealing way to do this is to; create separate input files for each distance to be studied. Most of; these input files are identical, except that the interatomic distance is; different. Psithon lets you specify all this in a single input file,; looping over the different distances with an array like this:; ``Rvals=[2.5, 3.0, 4.0]``. Let's also suppose you want to do counterpoise (CP) correction to compute interaction energies.; Counterpoise correction involves computing the dimer energy and then; subtracting out the energies of the two monomers, each evaluated in the; dimer basis. Again, each of these computations could be run in a separate; input file, but because counterpoise correction is a fairly standard; procedure for intermolecular interactions, |PSIfour| knows about it and has; a built-in routine to perform counterpoise correction. It only needs to; know what method you want to do the counterpoise correction on (here, let's; consider CCSD(T)), and it needs to know what's monomer A and what's monomer; B. This last issue of specifying the monomers separately was already dealt; with in the previous SAPT example, where we saw that two dashes in the; ``molecule`` block can be used to separate monomers. So, we're going to do counterpoise-corrected CCSD(T) energies for Ne\ :sub:`2` at; a series of different interatomic distances. And let's print out a table; of the interatomic distances we've considered, and the CP-corrected CCSD(T); interaction energies (in |kcalpermol|) at each geometry. Doing all this; in a single input is surprisingly easy in |PSIfour|. Here's the input; (available as :srcsample:`tu6-cp-ne2`). .. literalinclude:: @SFNX_INCLUDE@samples/tu6-cp-ne2/input.dat.

Integrability,"h:`N` is the size of the basis. * If there is not enough memory to perform the computation in one pass,; the program will do multiple passes through the entire set of integrals,; hence your computation will run that many times longer.; In such case, find the machine with the most memory and processors available. * On SMP machines, set the {\tt NUM\_THREADS} to the number of; processors available for the job, or, if all processors are allocated for; your job, set {\tt NUM\_THREADS} to {\em twice} the number of processors; you have. Modern operating systems schedulers are usually very efficient; at handling multithreaded programs, so the overhead of thread context; switching is not significant, but using more threads may lead to better; load balancing, and lower execution times. For example, on a 32-processor; IBM eServer p690 we found that the optimal number of threads was 128.; For the optimal performance, do a few runs with different number of threads; and see which number works best.; Avoid excessively large; number of threads, as this descreases the net amount of memory available to; the computation and thus may increase the number of passes. . * Set the {\tt MEMORY} keyword to the 90% of the available physical; memory, at most. There is a small amount of overhead associated with the; integral-direct algorithms that is not accounted for by the internal memory; handling routines. * The implementation of the integral-direct MP2-R12 (and MP2) method; in |PSIfour| can run efficiently on SMP, or shared-memory, machines,; by utilizing multiple processors via multithreaded approach.; However, it cannot utilize distributed memory machines,; such as commodity (PC) clusters and massively parallel machines,; to their full potential, since one computation can only take advantage; of one node of such machine at a time.; In such environments, the aformentioned MPQC implementation of; the MP2-R12 method should be preferred; (see \url{http://aros.ca.sandia.gov/~cljanss/mpqc/}).

Integrability,"ich may occur; for large systems or for systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using canonical orthogonalization, in; which an asymmetric inverse square root of the overlap matrix is; formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination of; eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs. When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102]_ and [Lehtola:2020:032504]_. This subset can then; be orthonormalized as usual; the rest of the basis functions are; hidden from the calculation. The Cholesky approach allows reaching; accurate energies even in the presence of significant linear; dependencies [Lehtola:2020:134108]_. In |PSIfour|, symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless; the smallest overlap eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double; option |scf__s_tolerance|, which defaults to 1E-7. If the smallest; eigenvalue is below this cutoff, canonical orthogonalization is; forced, and all eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues below the; cutoff are eliminated. If the eigendecomposition is detected to be numerically unstable - the; reciprocal condition number of the overlap matrix to be smaller than; the machine epsilon - the partial Cholesky decomposition is undertaken; until |scf__s_cholesky_tolerance|, which defaults to 1E-8. Use of symmetric, canonical, and partial Cholesky orthogonalization; can be forced by setting the |scf__s_orthogonalization| option to; ``SYMMETRIC``, ``CANONICAL``, or ``PARTIALCHOLESKY``,; respectively.

Integrability,"ional chemistry is essentially linear algebra on molecular; systems, so using stable, portable, scalable, and efficient numerical; linear algebra methods in |PSIfour| is critical. To that end, we use BLAS1; (vector-vector operations, like dot products), BLAS2 (matrix-vector; operations, like rank-1 update), BLAS3 (matrix-matrix operations, like; matrix multiplication), and LAPACK (advanced matrix decompositions and; solutions). The methods provided by BLAS and LAPACK are standard, but the; performance of actual implementations differ greatly from one version to; another. Moreover, the standard interfaces to the libraries are Fortran,; so |PSIfour| provides a common set of wrappers in :source:`psi4/src/psi4/libqt/qt.h` . .. warning:: Although block_matrix, init_array, and print_mat are still; around, their use is discouraged in favor of operations on; `psi4.core.Matrix` itself. The advice in these docs will catch up; shortly. BLAS Wrappers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. BLAS wrappers are currently fully supported at double precision. BLAS commands involving matrices are wrapped so as to be conventional; C-style ""row-major"" indexing, meaning that the column is the fast index; like normal. * The calls to BLAS1 routines are wrapped so as to allow for operations on; vectors with more than 2^{31} elements (~16 GB, getting to be a problem).; So passing a signed or unsigned long works, though the stride arguments; must be integers. * All routines are declared in ``qt.h``. Each routine is prefixed with a; ``C_``, followed by the standard Fortran name of the routine, in capital; letters. Input parameters of single primitives (``int``, ``double``,; ``unsigned long int``, ``char``, ...) are passed by value. Arrays,; including multidimensional arrays, are required to be in contiguous; memory (as provided by block_matrix, for example), and are passed by; providing a pointer to the first double or int element of the data (this; is array[0] if array is ``double**``).

BLAS commands involving matrices are wrapped so as to be conventional; C-style ""row-major"" indexing, meaning that the column is the fast index; like normal. * The calls to BLAS1 routines are wrapped so as to allow for operations on; vectors with more than 2^{31} elements (~16 GB, getting to be a problem).; So passing a signed or unsigned long works, though the stride arguments; must be integers. * All routines are declared in ``qt.h``. Each routine is prefixed with a; ``C_``, followed by the standard Fortran name of the routine, in capital; letters. Input parameters of single primitives (``int``, ``double``,; ``unsigned long int``, ``char``, ...) are passed by value. Arrays,; including multidimensional arrays, are required to be in contiguous; memory (as provided by block_matrix, for example), and are passed by; providing a pointer to the first double or int element of the data (this; is array[0] if array is ``double**``). BLAS1 routines occasionally; return values (DDOT for instance), BLAS2 and BLAS3 always return void.; For char arguments, case is insensitive.

(The exception is sandwich; mode, which, of course, permits optimizations with the Cfour optimizer.); Below is an example of a geometry optimization::. memory 200 mb; ; molecule {; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; ; R=0.958; A=104.5; }; ; set {; ; cfour_CALC_level CCSD(T); cfour_BASIS DZP; cfour_CC_CONV 12; cfour_LINEQ_CONV 12; cfour_SCF_CONV 12; g_convergence cfour; }. optimize('cfour'). Note that the primary change is the exchange of :py:func:`~psi4.driver.energy`; for :py:func:`~psi4.driver.optimize` to trigger an optimization. Setting; |optking__g_convergence|\ =CFOUR provides a good imitation of Cfour; default convergence criteria. Although Cfour produces gradients only in; its standard orientation and atom ordering, these are transformed back to; input orientation by the P4C4 interface. Several sample inputs in; :source:`tests/cfour/` starting with ``opt-`` show basic geometry; optimizations. :srcsample:`c",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/cfour.rst:9185,interface,interface,9185,doc/sphinxman/source/cfour.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/cfour.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"matrix A with the row-major BLAS wrappers effectively; involves ``L^T L = A``. On of the biggest consequences is in linear equations:; The input/output forcing/solution vector must be explicitly formed in; column-major indexing (each vector is placed in a C++ row, with its; entries along the C++ column). This is visualized in C++ as the transpose; of the forcing/solution vector. All routines are declared in qt.h. Each; routine is prefixed with a ``C_``, followed by the standard Fortran name of; the routine, in capital letters. Input parameters of single primitives; (int, double, unsigned long int, char, ...) are passed by value. Arrays,; including multidimensional arrays, are required to be in contiguous memory; (as provided by block_matrix, for example), and are passed by providing a; pointer to the first double or int element of the data (this is array[0]; if array is ``double**``). All routines return an int INFO with error and; calculation information specific to the routine, In Fortran, this is the; last argument in all LAPACK calls, but should not be provided as an; argument here. For char arguments, case is insensitive. A Cholesky; transform example is shown::. // BLAS/LAPACK; #include ""psi4/libqt/qt.h""; // block_matrix, init_array; #include ""psi4/libciomr/libciomr.h""; ; using namespace psi;; ...; int n = 100;; ; // Allocate A matrix;; double** A = block_matrix(n,n);; ; // Call the LAPACK DPOTRF to get the Cholesky factor; // Note this works in column-major order; // The result fills like:; // * * * *; // * * *; // * *; // *; // instead of the expected:; // *; // * *; // * * *; // * * * *; //; int info = C_DPOTRF('L', n, A[0], n);; ; // A bit painful, see below; fprintf(outfile, ""A:\n"");; print_mat(A,n,n,outfile);. // Block matrix should be free_blocked; free_block(A);.

FAQ <build_faq>; build_obtaining; build_planning; Installing from Binary <conda>. .. index:: scratch files, restart; .. _`sec:Scratch`:. Scratch Files; =============. One very important part of user configuration at the end of the; installation process; is to tell |PSIfour| where to write its temporary; (""scratch"") files. Electronic structure packages like |PSIfour| can; create rather large temporary disk files. It is very important to ; ensure that |PSIfour| is writing its temporary files to a disk drive; physically attached to the computer running the computation. If it; is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; By default, |PSIfour| will write temporary files to ``/tmp``, but this; directory is often not large enough for typical computations. Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB--1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell |PSIfour| the path to this; directory. Scratch file location can be specified through the ; :envvar:`PSI_SCRATCH` environment variable or through the |psirc| file; (see section :ref:`sec:psirc`). Most of the time, :envvar:`PSI_SCRATCH`; is preferred, and it overrides any existing |psirc| setting. You can set up ; :envvar:`PSI_SCRATCH` by issuing the following commands in a terminal,; or including them in the appropriate ``rc`` file. .. code-block:: tcsh. # csh, tcsh: add to shell or ~/.tcshrc file; setenv PSI_SCRATCH /path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/disk/for/scratch/files. .. code-block:: bash. # sh, bash: add to shell or ~/.bashrc (Linux/Windows) or ~/.bash_profile (Mac) file; export PSI_SCRATCH=/path/to/existing/writable/local-not-network/disk/for/scratch/files. |PSIfour| has a number of utilities that manage; input and output (I/O) of quantities to and from the hard disk.

Integrability,"nt of electron correlation for ""free"" was one of; the primary motivations for KS-DFT's adoption by chemists in the late 1980s and; early 1990s. Unfortunately, local KS-DFT exhibits several spectacular failures, most of which; stem from the exponential decay of the local Kohn--Sham potential, which cannot; encapsulate long-range information in the exchange and correlation holes. In the; exchange hole, this manifests as the problem of Many-Electron Self-Interaction; Error (MSIE), which presents as spurious low-lying charge transfer states in; excited-state calculations, eventual metallic breakdown in extended insulators,; poor thermochemistry, and complete lack of a derivative discontinuity in the; chemical potential as integer particle numbers are crossed. On the correlation; side, this is primarily observed in the inability of KS-DFT to treat dispersion; interactions. Generalized Kohn--Sham (GKS) functionals incorporate long-range information into; the functional through orbital-dependent contributions, and are designed to; combat the failures of local KS-DFT, particularly the MSIE on the exchange side.; Note that these functionals are often referred to as ""implicit"" density; functionals, as the orbitals are themselves functionals of the Kohn--Sham; potential. The simplest form of an exchange-side GKS is the global hybrid ansatz, in which; some fraction of the exact Hartree--Fock exchange of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is added to the functional, with the local part of the exchange; functional decreased by the corresponding amount. Note that the term; ""exact-exchange"" refers to the Hartree--Fock being the exact exchange energy of; the noninteracting quasiparticles, not the true electrons. Therefore, adding; 100% exact exchange is not physically reasonable, and will often lead to; extremely poor results. The fraction of exact-exchange, denoted :math:`\alpha`,; is often determined by adiabatic or heuristic arguments and is typically around; 25%.

From 1978-1987, the package was; know as the {\tt BERKELEY} suite, and after the Schaefer group moved to the; Center for Computational Quantum Chemistry at the University of Georgia,; the package was renamed {\tt PSI}. Thanks primarily to the efforts of Curt; Janssen (Sandia Labs, Livermore) and Ed Seidl (LLNL), the package was; ported to UNIX systems, and substantially improved with new input formats; and a C-based I/O system. Beginning in 1999, an extensive effort was begun to develop \PSIthree\; --- a {\tt PSI} suite with a completely new face. As a result of this; effort, all of the legacy Fortran code was removed, and everything was; rewritten in C and C++, including new integral/derivative integral,; coupled cluster, and CI codes. In addition, new I/O libraries have; been added, as well as an improved checkpoint file structure and greater; automation of typical tasks such as geometry optimization and frequency; analysis. The package has the capability to determine wavefunctions,; energies, analytic gradients, and various molecular properties based on; a variety of theories, including spin-restricted, spin-unrestricted, and; restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (RHF, UHF, and ROHF); configuration; interaction (CI) (including a variety of multireference CI's and full; CI); coupled-cluster (CC) including CC with variationaly optimized; orbitals; second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MPPT); including explicitly correlated second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset energy; (MP2-R12); and complete-active-space self-consistent field (CASSCF); theory. By January 2008, all of the C code in \PSIthree\ was ; converted to C++ to enable a path toward more object-oriented design; and a single-excecutable framework that will facilitate code reuse and ; ease efforts at parallelization. At this same time, all of the legacy I/O; routines from {\tt PSI2} were removed, greatly streamlining the; \library{libciomr.a} library.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/attic/history.rst:2615,rout,routines,2615,doc/sphinxman/source/attic/history.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/attic/history.rst,1,['rout'],['routines']

Integrability,"o fully test |PSIfour|.; This has indeed been the case until March 2022.; The difficulty has been that (1) two test suites is unexpected so some developers don't know to run both; and (2) there are important tests in the PSIthon suite that can't be run on a |PSIfour| installation since CTest only works in a build directory.; Now, by adding an extra file to the test directory (:ref:`faq:psithon_through_pytest`), PSIthon tests can also be run through :program:`pytest`.; This hasn't rolled out to all ~500 PSIthon tests (help wanted), but eventually |PSIfour| can be tested with a single command from a build or from an installation.; Therefore, in designing a test, choose its mode based on whether PSIthon or PsiAPI suits it better and whether it's a simple model for users (probably PSIthon) or for expert users (probably PsiAPI).; Both will continue to work in future, and neither have limitations. Test Contents; =============. * Most |PSIfour| tests will be integration tests focusing on non-regression of user input to answers, and we insist on having these.; But if you find unit tests helpful, by all means add them to the test suite. * Most tests should store reference results (from literature or another implementation or a carefully run |PSIfour| calculation),; run quantum chemistry, then apply one or more of the :ref:`faq:comparison_functions` so that the test will fail if the answer is unexpected.; The functions are the same in CTest and pytest, but in the former they are, for example, ``compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...)`` while in the latter it's asserted, like ``assert compare_matrices(refmat, mat, ...)``.; The main advantage of the testing functions is that they provide helpful error printing upon failure. Deep down, they're NumPy functions. * In preparing the test case reference values, aim for the converged value rather than many digits from your computer under default convergence conditions.; This will make the test more robust for different OS, different BLAS li",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/add_tests.rst:4225,integrat,integration,4225,doc/sphinxman/source/add_tests.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/add_tests.rst,1,['integrat'],['integration']

A totally new Python front-end makes |PSIfour| incredibly user-friendly; and automates many common tasks such as basis set extrapolation, composite; methods, running the same computation on every molecule in a test set, etc.; Density-functional theory, absent in Psi3, is quite efficient; in |PSIfour|, with many functionals available. Density fitting is ubiquitous in; |PSIfour|, leading to some of the most efficient MP2 and CCSD(T) code available.; |PSIfour| also introduces extensive,; powerful features for energy component analysis of non-covalent interactions; via symmetry-adapted perturbation theory.

The hand-implemented OS recursion code also took care of the Cartesian->pure; transformation (if required by the basis set). The mechanism for handling this; was to provide a public facing ``compute_shell(int P, int Q)`` method for the; caller; this then looked up the appropriate ``GaussianShell`` objects that were; passed into the corresponding (private) ``compute_pair(GaussianShell &s1,; GaussianShell &s2)`` function that computed the integrals and transformed them; to the spherical harmonic basis, if needed. The switch to Libint2 integrals; preserves this mechanism, but the ``compute_shell(int P, int Q)`` simply looks; up the appropriate Libint2-compatible shells and hands them off to the; re-written, private ``compute_pair()`` routines, which call Libint2 directly.; Therefore, any calls to shell-pair level integral computations should look the; same as before the introduction of Libint2, however access to the integrals has; changed, as described below. Accessing integrals; ................... Before the Libint2 transition, one electron integrals were computed in a flat; array, internally called `buffer_`, which was accessed through the integral; object's ``buffer()`` method.

LAPACK Wrappers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. All standard LAPACK 3.2 double precision routines are provided. LAPACK commands remain in Fortran's ""column-major"" indexing, so all the; results will be transposed, and leading dimensions may have to be fiddled; with (using ``lda = n`` in both directions for square matrices is highly; recommended). An example of the former problem is a Cholesky; Decomposition: you expect to get back a lower triangular matrix L such; that ``L L^T = A``, but this is returned in column-major order, so the actual; recovery of the matrix A with the row-major BLAS wrappers effectively; involves ``L^T L = A``. On of the biggest consequences is in linear equations:; The input/output forcing/solution vector must be explicitly formed in; column-major indexing (each vector is placed in a C++ row, with its; entries along the C++ column).

Higher-Order SAPT; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. For smaller systems (up to the size of a nucleic acid base pair), more; accurate interaction energies can be obtained through higher-order SAPT; computations. The SAPT module can perform density-fitted evaluations; of SAPT2, SAPT2+, SAPT2+(3), and SAPT2+3 energies for closed-shell systems ; only. Publications resulting from the use of the higher-order SAPT code ; should cite the following: ; [Hohenstein:2010:014101]_. For methods SAPT2+ and above, one can replace the many-body treatment of; dispersion by an improved method based on coupled-cluster doubles (CCD).; This approach tends to give good improvements when dispersion effects; are very large, as in the PCCP dimer (see [Hohenstein:2011:2842]_).; As shown in [Parker:2014:094106]_, whether or not CCD dispersion offers; more accurate interaction energies tends to depend on the SAPT truncation; and basis set employed, due to cancellations of errors. Thanks to; natural orbital methods [Parrish:2013:174102]_, the SAPT code; is able to include CCD dispersion with only a modest additional cost.; Computations employing CCD dispersion should cite [Parrish:2013:174102]_. ; To request CCD dispersion treatment in a SAPT computation, simply append; ``(ccd)`` to the name of the method, as in the following examples ::. 	energy('sapt2+(ccd)'); 	energy('sapt2+(3)(ccd)'); 	energy('sapt2+3(ccd)').

From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled |PSIfour| with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL). Control of threading in |PSIfour| can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model.

Integrability,"this point, the code switches on the requested Direct integrals technology, which; requires only four full iterations to reach convergence, starting from the DF; guess. This hybrid DF/Direct procedure can significantly accelerate SCF; computations requiring exact integrals. After the iterations are completed, a number of one-electron properties are; printed, and some bookkeeping is performed to set up possible correlated; computations. Additional one-electron properties are available by increasing the; |globals__print| option.

Integrability,"uffice for :samp:`{symbol}`.; For certain computations, the user might want to specify which particular; subgroup is to be used by appending a unique axis specifier. For example when; running a computation on a molecule with :math:`D_{2h}` symmetry in :math:`C_{2v}`, the; :math:`C_2` axis can be chosen as either the :math:`x`, the :math:`y`, or the :math:`z`; these can; be specified by requesting the symmetry as ``c2vx``, ``c2vy``, or ``c2vz``, respectively.; Likewise the ``c2x``, ``c2y``, ``c2z``, ``c2hx``, ``c2hy``, and ``c2hz``; labels are valid. For :math:`C_s` symmetry the labels ``csx``, ``csy``, and; ``csz`` request the :math:`yz`, :math:`xz`, and :math:`xy` planes be used as the mirror plane,; respectively. If no unique axis is specified, |PSIfour| will choose an appropriate; subgroup. Certain types of finite difference computations, such as numerical vibrational; frequencies, might lower the symmetry of the molecule. When this happens; symmetry-dependent arrays, such as |globals__socc|, are automatically remapped; to the lower symmetry. For example, if we were to investigate the :math:`^2B_1`; state of water cation, we can specify ::. SOCC = [0, 0, 1, 0]. in the input file. If any ensuing computations lower the symmetry, the above; array will be appropriately remapped. For example, reducing the symmetry to; :math:`C_s` (with the molecular plane defining the mirror plane), the above; array will be automatically interpreted as::. SOCC = [0, 1]. Some caution is required, however. The :math:`^2A_1` state can be obtained with; the ::. SOCC = [1, 0, 0, 0]. specification, which would become ::. SOCC = [1, 0]. under the above-mentioned reduction in symmetry. The :math:`^2B_2` state,; whose singly-occupied orbitals are ::. SOCC = [0, 0, 0, 1]. would be mapped to ::. SOCC = [1, 0]. which is the same occupation as the :math:`^2A_1` state. In this case, the; :math:`^2A_1` state is lower in energy, and is not problematic.

Integrability,"ultipole analysis (DMA) technique, developed by Anthony J.; Stone and implemented by him into the `GDMA package; <http://www-stone.ch.cam.ac.uk/programs.html>`_, is available in |PSIfour|.; The current implementation simply embeds Stone's GDMA code into the main; executable, and generates the appropriate input files automatically. The; program takes as input a data file, and a Gaussian formatted checkpoint (see; Section :ref:`FCHK <sec:fchk>`) file. The simplest usage of the GDMA code is; demonstrated below, along with a listing of the options supported; these; options correspond to the options described in the ; :download:`GDMA manual <gdma-2.3.pdf>`. If more advanced usage is desired, which is not is permitted by the options; listed below, the user may provide their own data file containing keywords to; control the GDMA code. Simply place the data file in the directory |PSIfour|; is called from, and provide the file name as the datafile argument to the; :py:func:`~psi4.driver.gdma` routine. For example, if GDMA data file is called; *control.dma*, the GDMA code is called as follows::. grad, wfn = gradient('mp2', return_wfn=True); gdma(wfn, datafile='control.dma').

(I'm sorry that the; name of the basis doesn't appear in ``ZMAT``, but the combination of the; ~14 character basis name limit and the absence of a comment line marker; rather precludes that helpful label.). The input below employs a |PSIfour| library basis set and also introduces; the final stage of conversion toward |PSIfour| format. Instead of the; generic ``'cfour'``, the computational method is specified as the first; argument to the :py:func:`~psi4.driver.optimize` call. In the computational; command below, the string argument ``'c4-ccsd(t)'`` directs that a CCSD(T); computation be run using Cfour (as opposed to ``'ccsd(t)'`` which would; call |PSIfour| CC code). Specifying computational method in this manner; sets |cfour__cfour_calc_level| from the argument and; |cfour__cfour_deriv_level| as appropriate from the function call:; :py:func:`~psi4.driver.energy`, :py:func:`~psi4.dr",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/cfour.rst:13217,interface,interface,13217,doc/sphinxman/source/cfour.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/cfour.rst,1,['interface'],['interface']

On the second line, we define; the name of the executable to be generated, in this example we opt for the; unimaginative title of \module{integrals}. Line 4 provides the list of source files; that the project comprises; these will be detailed below. The top source; directory for the \PSIfour\ installation and the top object directory (where; \PSIfour\ was compiled) should be provided on lines 6 and 8, respectively.; Lines 10 and 11 describe the flags needed to link in the \module{BLAS} and; \module{LAPACK} libraries and might need a combination of ``\file{-L; folder\_name}'' and ``\file{-l library\_name}'', depending on your system's; setup. Finally, the compiler and flags are detailed on lines 12--17. It's a; good idea to use the flags described on line 16 for development; they speed up; code compilation and provide lots of information for standard debugging tools.; As noted in the \file{Makefile} itself, nothing below line 17 should require; modification for any other \PSIfour\ project.

Improving upon CCSD, the CCSD(T) method [Raghavachari:1989]_ includes; a perturbative estimate of the energy contributed by the :math:`{\hat{T}_3}`; operator. The computational cost of this additional term scales as; :math:`{\cal{O}}(o^3 v^4)`, making it rather expensive for molecules with more than; a dozen heavy atoms or so. However, when this method is affordable, it; provides very high quality results in most cases. |PSIfour| is capable of computing energies and analytic gradients for a; number of coupled cluster models. It can also compute linear response; properties (such as static or frequency-dependent polarizability,; or optical rotation angles) for some models. Excited states can; also be computed by the CC2 and CC3 models, or by EOM-CCSD. Table; :ref:`CC Methods <table:ccsummary>` summarizes these capabilities.

To simplify parsing of options and handling of defaults, the Options class; was created. It functions in the following way:. - Each module (or plugin) declares which options it will look for in the; input: their name, type (string, int, double, array, etc.), and any; default value they take. - The input is parsed for these options, and defaults are assigned for; those keywords not specified by the user. - The c-side module or plugin can then query the Options object for the; values associated with each keyword. - The options will also be accessible py-side to the procedures that drive; the modules. Array-type options are not available in python. Declaring Options; -----------------. Each module needs to make itself known to the Options object, via a; read_options section. For plugins, this routine is provided by the user; in the plugin code.

Since quantum chemical methods in |PSIfour| are accessed through Python functions, and; most important quantities are available as PSI variables, it is straightforward; to create aliases to commonly run calculations or to define hybrid methods. The; :source:`psi4/driver/aliases.py` file is intended for editing by the user for; this purpose. As an example, the MP2.5 method; (which admittedly is already built in to |PSIfour|); is the average of MP2 and MP3. The latter is; available through the arbitrary order MPn code and returns all lower energies; along with it in PSI variables. The following is basic code that will compute; and return the MP2.5 energy. ::. def run_mp2_5(name, **kwargs):; ; energy('mp3', **kwargs); e_scf = psi4.get_variable('SCF TOTAL ENERGY'); ce_mp2 = psi4.get_variable('MP2 CORRELATION ENERGY'); ce_mp3 = psi4.get_variable('MP3 CORRELATION ENERGY'); ; ce_mp25 = 0.5 * (ce_mp2 + ce_mp3); e_mp25 = e_scf + ce_mp25; ; print """""" MP2.5 total energy: %16.8f\n"""""" % (e_mp25); print """""" MP2.5 correlation energy: %16.8f\n"""""" % (ce_mp25); ; return e_mp25.

The coupling matrix ( :math:`{X} = C^{S} (C^{L})^{-1}` ) is obtained from the large (:math:`C^{\rm L}`) and small (:math:`C^{\rm S}`) components of the :math:`N` positive energy solutions of the Dirac equation.; The renormalization matrix ; :math:`{R}=S^{-1/2}(S^{-1/2}\tilde{S}S^{-1/2})^{-1/2}S^{1/2}`,; depends on the modified overlap matrix; :math:`\tilde{S}=S+\frac{1}{2c^2}X^{\dagger}TX`. The integrals :math:`W^{\rm SF}_{\mu\nu} = \langle {\chi_\mu} | \hat{p}\cdot (\hat{V}\hat{p}) |{\chi_\nu}\rangle` can be easily computed as derivatives of the nuclear-electron attraction integrals with respect to nuclear coordinates.; Existing nonrelativistic electronic structure code can be extended to include scalar relativistic effects; treated with the X2C method by replacing nonrelativistic kinetic and potential energy with the corresponding; X2C operators :math:`T_{X2C}` and :math:`V_{X2C}`. It is important to note that fully uncontracted basis in needed for the construction of X2C Hamiltonian as Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW [FW:1950]_) transformation is obtained in kinetically balance basis.

Modifiability," created using this procedure. Files in a Plugin Directory; ---------------------------. In addition to the main ``myplugin.cc`` file, a fresh plugin directory contains the following files. * **CMakeLists.txt** |w---w| CMake file governing project *plugin*.; The plugin source and CMakeLists.txt is independent of platform; and |PSIfour| installation. You use CMake (version 3.1 or later); to generate a Makefile for the plugin by pointing it to a specific; |PSIfour| installation. Run ``psi4 --plugin-compile`` to get a command; to execute to generate the Makefile. What that command is doing is; loading the compilers and options used to build the parent |PSIfour|; (the ``-C psi4PluginCache`` part) which in turn can be overridden; by passing ``-Doption=value`` commands to ``cmake`` *and* pointing; toward a particular |PSIfour| (and probably pybind11) library to; link against (the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` part) *and* telling it to; do an in-source build (the ``.`` part). Then just run ``make`` in; your plugin directory. After any change to the plugin C++ code,; ``make`` must be run in the plugin directory to recompile the; ``myplugin.so`` executable, but recompiling the main |PSIfour| code; is not necessary. Should you add additional (non-header) files to; the plugin or need to link to additional external libraries, add that; information here. * **input.dat** |w---w| Sample input file for the plugin.; Since the ``__init__.py`` file makes the plugin directory look like a; Python module, the plugin can be treated as such in an input file. The; location of the plugin directory must be included in :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`,; either externally in the calling shell or defined in the input file.; This is usually done by manipulating :envvar:`PSIPATH`. Then,; the plugin can be loaded as ``import myplugin`` and executed as; ``energy('myplugin')``. Any other Python functions are also available from; the input file, *e.g.* ``myplugin.testfunction()``, note the namespace; protection. * **pymo",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/plugins.rst:8338,plugin,plugin,8338,doc/sphinxman/source/plugins.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/plugins.rst,1,['plugin'],['plugin']

Please file; an issue if found otherwise. Dispersion corrections are built into DFT functionals, so appending an *a; posteriori* correction to a computation is as simple as; ``energy('b2plyp-d')`` *vs.* ``energy('b2plyp')``. For example, the; following input file computes (with much redundant work) for water a; B3LYP, a B3LYP-D2, a B3LYP-D3 (zero-damping), and a B3LYP-D4 (Becke-Johnson damping) energy. ::. molecule h2o {; O; H 1 1.0; H 1 1.0 2 104.5; }; set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }; energy('b3lyp'); energy('b3lyp-d'); energy('b3lyp-d3'); energy('b3lyp-d4').

This ensures success; of the |PSIfour| build, reproducibility of the runtime results, and; freedom for continued upstream development. Sometimes, you're the one; doing that development, and you need the CMake superbuild to pull source; from a local path rather than the approved codeset.

Modifiability," integrals. The factorization of the SAPT energy; expressions, as implemented in |PSIfour|, assumes the use of density-fitted; two-electron integrals, therefore, the closed-shell SAPT module cannot be run with; exact integrals. In practice, we have found that the density-fitting; approximation introduces negligible errors into the SAPT energy ; (often less than 0.01 kcal/mol for small dimers) and greatly; improves efficiency. . The latest addition to the SAPT code is the SAPT0 method for open-shell ; monomers [Gonthier:2016:134106]_. This code is available for both exact and density fitted integrals, ; except for the dispersion terms which implementation relies on a density fitting; factorization. Both ``UHF`` and ``ROHF`` |scf__reference| can be used, but coupled; induction computations are currently not supported with ``ROHF``. This means that orbital; relaxation is not included for ``ROHF`` and the uncoupled induction term is computed instead.; If both monomers are open-shell, their coupling is assumed to be high spin, i.e.; two doublets would interact to form a triplet. The *S*\ :superscript:`2` approximation and scaling; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. All exchange terms in SAPT arise from the antisymmetrization; of the wavefunctions of monomers A and B. Taking into account exchange of all possible; electron pairs between the two monomers yields to complicated formulae.; For this reason, exchange terms are often evaluated in the :math:`S^{2}`; approximation, that can be interpreted as the exchange of a single electron ; pair between monomers. The :math:`S^{2}` approximation is usually pretty good, but may ; break down for short intermolecular distance, particularly in high-order; terms. To compensate for these deviations, in 2014 Parker et al. [Parker:2014:094106]_ ; recommended to scale all :math:`S^{2}` approximated exchange terms by the ratio:. .. math:: p_{EX}(\alpha) = \left( \frac{E_{exch}^{(10)}}{E_{exch}^{(10)}(S^{2})} \right)^{\alp",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/sapt.rst:11117,coupling,coupling,11117,doc/sphinxman/source/sapt.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/sapt.rst,1,['coupling'],['coupling']

The atom lines should not contain any dummy atoms (what's the use in cartesian form). For dimer systems, an algorithm is used to apportion the atoms into two fragments; thus the atoms need not be arranged with all fragmentA atoms before all fragmentB atoms.

The PSI suite of {\em ab initio} quantum chemistry programs is the result; of an ongoing attempt by a cadre of graduate students, postdoctoral; associates, and professors to produce code that is efficient but also; easy to extend to new theoretical methods. Significant effort has been; devoted to the development of libraries which are robust and easy to use.; Some of the earliest contributions to what is now referred to as ``PSI''; include a direct configuration interaction (CI) program (Robert Lucchese,; 1976, now at Texas A\&M), the well-known graphical unitary group CI program; (Bernie Brooks, 1977-78, now at N.I.H.), and the original integrals code; (Russ Pitzer, 1978, now at Ohio State). From 1978-1987, the package was; know as the {\tt BERKELEY} suite, and after the Schaefer group moved to the; Center for Computational Quantum Chemistry at the University of Georgia,; the package was renamed {\tt PSI}. Thanks primarily to the efforts of Curt; Janssen (Sandia Labs, Livermore) and Ed Seidl (LLNL), the package was; ported to UNIX systems, and substantially improved with new input formats; and a C-based I/O system. Beginning in 1999, an extensive effort was begun to develop \PSIthree\; --- a {\tt PSI} suite with a completely new face. As a result of this; effort, all of the legacy Fortran code was removed, and everything was; rewritten in C and C++, including new integral/derivative integral,; coupled cluster, and CI codes. In addition, new I/O libraries have; been added, as well as an improved checkpoint file structure and greater; automation of typical tasks such as geometry optimization and frequency; analysis. The package has the capability to determine wavefunctions,; energies, analytic gradients, and various molecular properties based on; a variety of theories, including spin-restricted, spin-unrestricted, and; restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (RHF, UHF, and ROHF); configuration; interaction (CI",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/attic/history.rst:287,extend,extend,287,doc/sphinxman/source/attic/history.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/attic/history.rst,2,"['config', 'extend']","['configuration', 'extend']"

Modifiability,", and Aa. Jensen [Olsen:1988]_. Excitation-class; selected multi-reference CI wavefunctions, such as second-order CI,; can be formulated as RAS CI's. A RAS CI selects determinants for the; model space as those which have no more than :math:`n` holes in the lowest set; of orbitals (called RAS I) and no more than :math:`m` electrons in the highest; set of orbitals (called RAS III). An intermediate set of orbitals, if; present (RAS II), has no restrictions placed upon it. All determinants; satisfying these rules are included in the RAS CI. The DETCI module is also very efficient at computing full configuration; interaction; wavefunctions, and it is used in this capacity in the complete-active-space; self-consistent-field (CASSCF) code. It can also perform approximate; CASSCF computations in which one uses RAS restrictions on the CI excitations,; rather than doing a full CI in the active space. This is called a ; RASSCF. CASSCF and RASSCF computations are types of multi-configurational; self-consistent-field procedures, and are described in :ref:`sec:mcscf`. As mentioned above, the DETCI module is designed for challenging; chemical systems for which simple CISD is not suitable. Because; CI wavefunctions which go beyond CISD (such as RAS CI) are fairly complex,; typically the DETCI code will be used in cases where the; tradeoffs between computational expense and completeness of the; model space are nontrivial. Hence, the user is advised to develop; a good working knowledge of multi-reference and RAS CI methods before; attempting to use the program for a production-level project. This user's; manual will provide only an elementary introduction to the most; important keywords. Additional information is available in the complete; list of keywords for DETCI provided in Appendix :ref:`apdx:detci`.

CMake does a good job scanning your computer to locate libraries, header; files, and executables needed for compilation. So it's very possible that; from :samp:`{top-level-psi4-dir}` source directory, you can call :samp:`cmake -S.; -B{objdir}` without any further arguments, and it will invoke ``cmake``,; detect some appropriate defaults, configure the build, create a build; directory :samp:`{objdir}`, and complete, leaving you to only invoke; ``make`` or Ninja in the new build directory. Should this happy scenario not come to pass, or if the default build; options are not to your taste, use the links within :ref:`core; dependencies <faq:coredepend>` and :ref:`add-on dependencies; <faq:addondepend>` to plan a set of arguments to ``cmake`` tailored to; your computer. Proceed to :ref:`quick build <faq:buildquick>` or; :ref:`detailed build <faq:builddetailed>`. ..

Modifiability,". To; facilitate this workflow, |PSIfour| exports key quantities such as integrals,; densities and molecular orbitals in NumPy format. From this point, the; programmer can simply call the appropriate |PSIfour| functions to compute the; desired input quantities, retrieve them in NumPy format, and then write the; remaining code using standard Python and/or NumPy syntax. This approach does; not require any recompilation of code, resulting in a particularly facile; development workflow. Detailed examples and tutorials are available in the; `Psi4NumPy <https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy>`_ repository. .. _`sec:prog_plugins`:. Avoiding the need to modify Psi4, using plugins; -----------------------------------------------. In the early days when |PSIfour| was still primarily a C++ code, development; was very cumbersome due to a lengthy build process. To expedite development, a; plugin system was developed. This plugin machinery allows developers to access; the classes defined in the innards of |PSIfour|, with only the small plugin; code requiring recompilation during development. The resulting lightweight; code can be maintained and distributed independently of |PSIfour|, making this; a good strategy for development, especially in cases where tighter integration; of the new code with existing |PSIfour| machinery is required than that; afforded by the Numpy based strategy outlined in the :ref:`sec:prog_psi4numpy`; section. For details about how to write these plugins, see the; :ref:`sec:plugins` section. .. _`sec:prog_fullintegration`:. Incorporating code into |PSIfour|; ---------------------------------. For features to be incorporated fully into the |PSIfour| ecosystem, changes to; the core routines are inevitable. However, the programmer should think very; carefully about the most appropriate language for the task in hand. Let's; consider a new feature that downloads some data from an external source and; then performs some kind of expensive matrix operation on those data",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/prog_ways_to_add.rst:4369,plugin,plugin,4369,doc/sphinxman/source/prog_ways_to_add.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/prog_ways_to_add.rst,2,['plugin'],['plugin']

Order of math libraries; -----------------------. Order is set by MATH_LIB_SEARCH_ORDER in MathLibs.cmake.; You can override this order by setting BLAS_TYPE and/or LAPACK_TYPE; for example to ATLAS or some other library that you prefer. What to edit if your math library is not found although you have set MATH_ROOT?; -------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Normally you only need to edit MathLibs.cmake to add new libraries; or edit existing ones. Since a vendor can provide libraries with different ""fingerprints""; (example MKL), you can define different combinations (up to 9), for instance::. set(MKL_BLAS_LIBS ...); set(MKL_BLAS_LIBS2 ...); set(MKL_BLAS_LIBS3 ...); set(MKL_BLAS_LIBS4 ...); set(MKL_BLAS_LIBS5 ...).

The declaration of ``basis_sets`` is completely standard Python, as is the next; line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that ``basis_set`` is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign. . The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the; angle and bond length in water::. molecule h2o{; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }; ; Rvals = [0.9, 1.0, 1.1]; Avals = range(102, 106, 2); ; set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of ``Rvals`` and ``Avals`` are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule ``h2o`` we can then set the values of ``R`` and ``A`` within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the ``set`` keyword.

Creating New Plugins; ====================. Modular Approach to Development; -------------------------------. It is slightly cumbersome to the development cycle to recompile |PSIfour|; every time a change is made to the C++ code.; It's also daunting to new developers if they're required to; learn the structure of the source tree, executable initialization code,; and makefile systems in the existing code in order to add new features,; which was never a problem with Psi3 due to the independent; nature of the modules. To overcome these problems, |PSIfour| now has a; useful plugin feature. This allows codes to be developed as standalone; entities, which are compiled independently of the Psi source, but can; still link against Psi's vast library. The plugins can be loaded at; run-time from any location. .. _`sec:newplugins`:.

Every energy calculation is performed by a class; that derives from Wavefunction and is accessible as a return value in the; Python layer. The Wavefunction class contains all pertinent calculation; results, such as one-particle densities, molecular orbitals and gradients. Completely new methods; ----------------------. A new method that is not a modification of existing code belongs in its own; folder in :source:`psi4/src/psi4`; see other folders in that exist in that; location for examples of setting up CMake, and make sure that the new folder is; added to :source:`psi4/src/psi4/CMakeLists.txt`. There are also a number of; variables that can be exported to be available to the user, as detailed in; :ref:`sec:psiVariables`. To set these variables, the following member of; Wavefunction should be called::. set_variable(""Variable Name"", variable_value);. The new variable should also be documented in; :source:`doc/sphinxman/source/glossary_psivariables.rst`. There are a; number of different helpers to export various quantities from the wavefunction; to external formats such as FCHK and MOLDEN. Because the Wavefunction makes; its members available to the Python layer, any other similar export functions; should be written in python. Integral consuming technologies; -------------------------------. The general philosophy in |PSIfour| is to try write two-electron integral; driven tasks in methods like Hartree-Fock, CIS and CPHF in terms of generalized; Fock-like matrices. From here, a single class can be used to construct these; generalized Fock matrices, which is what libFock; (:source:`psi4/src/psi4/libfock`) accomplishes. A number of integral; technologies -- such as integral-direct, disk-based and density fitting -- are; supported in libFock, making them generally available to all elements of the; code that use the generalized Fock matrix strategy. .. _`sec:prog_tour-exposing`:.

This kind of analysis gives a lot; of insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions, and |PSIfour|; makes these computations easier than ever.

How to call BLAS & LAPACK in |PSIfour|; --------------------------------------. Computational chemistry is essentially linear algebra on molecular; systems, so using stable, portable, scalable, and efficient numerical; linear algebra methods in |PSIfour| is critical. To that end, we use BLAS1; (vector-vector operations, like dot products), BLAS2 (matrix-vector; operations, like rank-1 update), BLAS3 (matrix-matrix operations, like; matrix multiplication), and LAPACK (advanced matrix decompositions and; solutions). The methods provided by BLAS and LAPACK are standard, but the; performance of actual implementations differ greatly from one version to; another. Moreover, the standard interfaces to the libraries are Fortran,; so |PSIfour| provides a common set of wrappers in :source:`psi4/src/psi4/libqt/qt.h` . .. warning:: Although block_matrix, init_array, and print_mat are still; around, their use is discouraged in favor of operations on; `psi4.core.Matrix` itself.

To harness the power of Python, |PSIfour| makes the most pertinent results; of each computation available to the Python interpreter for; post-processing. To demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of; H\ :sub:`2` and H atom::. molecule h2 {; H; H 1 0.9; }; ; set basis cc-pvdz; set reference rhf; h2_energy = energy('scf'); ; molecule h {; H; }; ; set basis cc-pvdz; set reference uhf; h_energy = energy('scf'); ; D_e = psi_hartree2kcalmol * (2*h_energy - h2_energy); print ""De=%f"" % D_e. The :py:func:`~psi4.driver.energy` function returns the final result of the; computation, the requested total energy in Hartrees, which we assign to a; Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a dissociation; energy and printed to the output file using standard Python notation. Generally, there are multiple quantities of interest. Appendix; :ref:`apdx:psivariables_module` lists PSI variables variables set by each; module, and :ref:`apdx:psivariables_alpha` defines them. These can be; accessed through the :py:func:`~psi4.core.get_variable` function. For example, after; performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component; scaled energy and the unscaled MP2 energy are made available::. e_mp2 = get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2 = get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of a; calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file with; the input file command :py:func:`~psi4.core.print_variables`. Note that PSI variables; are cleared at the start of each :py:func:`~psi4.driver.energy`, etc. in an input; file by :py:func:`~psi4.core.clean_variables()`.; So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI followed by a; aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a :py:func:`~psi4.core.print_variables` command, the; last will include :psivar:`SCF TOTAL ENERGY` but not; :psivar:`FCI TOTAL ENERGY`.; The en",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/psithoninput.rst:9721,variab,variables,9721,doc/sphinxman/source/psithoninput.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/psithoninput.rst,2,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"=========================. To allow arbitrarily complex computations to be performed, |PSIfour| was built; upon the Python interpreter. However, to make the input syntax simpler, some; pre-processing of the input file is performed before it is interpreted,; resulting in Python syntax that is customized for PSI, termed Psithon. In; this section we will describe the essential features of the Psithon language.; |PSIfour| is distributed with an extensive test suite, described in section; :ref:`apdx:testSuite`; the input files for these test cases can be found in the; samples subdirectory of the top-level |PSIfour| source directory and should; serve as useful examples. .. index:: physical constants; .. _`sec:physicalConstants`:. Physical Constants; ==================. For convenience, the Python interpreter will execute the contents of the; |psirc| file in the current user's home area (if present) before performing any; tasks in the input file. This allows frequently used python variables to be; automatically defined in all input files. For example, if we repeatedly make; use of the universal gravitational constant, the following line could be placed; in the |psirc| file ::. UGC = 6.67384E-11 # m^3 / kg^-1 s^-2. which would make the variable ``UGC`` available in all |PSIfour| input files.; For convenience, the physical constants used within the |PSIfour| code (which; are obtained from `NIST CODATA 2014; <https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/archive2014.html>`_; are also automatically loaded as Psithon; variables (before |psirc| is loaded, so that the user's |psirc| values can; override the builtins (in the input file, not in the C++ code).

Modifiability,"=============================. Included in |PSIfour| is functionality to automatically render specified surfaces, including molecular orbitals,; densities, and basis functions, using VMD. The vmd_cube.py script takes the .cube files generated; in a calculation and generates images aligned with user-input specifications. The script is located; in :source:`psi4/share/psi4/scripts/vmd_cube.py`. Script Prerequisites; --------------------. 1. VMD must be installed, and it can be downloaded for free at (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). Additionally,; the script needs to know where to find the VMD executable, and this is defined as :envvar:`VMDPATH`. VMDPATH must be defined as; an environment variable. 2. To generate images with multiple surfaces, ImageMagick must also be installed. ImageMagick is a free program which; can be installed using homebrew/pip or from http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php . 3. With ImageMagick installed, an environment variable called :envvar:`MONTAGE` needs to be created which points to the montage executable.; This executable can be found in the /bin/ sub-directory wherever ImageMagick was installed. .. envvar:: VMDPATH. Filesystem path to the VMD executable. .. envvar:: MONTAGE. Filesystem path to the Montage executable of ImageMagick. Running the Script; ------------------. 1.

Call vmd_cube.py and pass the directory containing; the .cube files as an argument::; 	; 	python vmd_cube.py /path/to/cube/files/. By default the script will search for cube files in the directory in which it is called.; In addition to individual image files for each orbital, vmd_cube will also generate an image containing all surfaces in an array; (very useful for hand-picking orbital spaces). 3.

This plugin machinery allows developers to access; the classes defined in the innards of |PSIfour|, with only the small plugin; code requiring recompilation during development.

Alternatively and preferentially to the above, you can instead build and install the; Add-On library yourself, external to the |PSIfour| repository. This; is especially useful if you want to avoid full recompiles of the; Add-On at each change to the Add-On's source. Build the Add-On; library dynamically (``-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON``) and mind any; ""Psi4 wants"" in the Add-On's top-level CMakeLists.txt.

The new variable should also be documented in; :source:`doc/sphinxman/source/glossary_psivariables.rst`. There are a; number of different helpers to export various quantities from the wavefunction; to external formats such as FCHK and MOLDEN. Because the Wavefunction makes; its members available to the Python layer, any other similar export functions; should be written in python. Integral consuming technologies; -------------------------------. The general philosophy in |PSIfour| is to try write two-electron integral; driven tasks in methods like Hartree-Fock, CIS and CPHF in terms of generalized; Fock-like matrices. From here, a single class can be used to construct these; generalized Fock matrices, which is what libFock; (:source:`psi4/src/psi4/libfock`) accomplishes. A number of integral; technologies -- such as integral-direct, disk-based and density fitting -- are; supported in libFock, making them generally available to all elements of the; code that use the generalized Fock matrix strategy. .. _`sec:prog_tour-exposing`:. Exposing C++ code to Python; ---------------------------. The recent push to move sections of the code that are not a bottleneck into the; Python layer requires that the C++ code is callable from Python and that its; results are accessible. The result accessibility is addressed by populating; the appropriate variables in the Wavefunction object. To make the code; callable from Python, we rely on the excellent `PyBind11 <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ library; to create the bindings.

Also, the basis can be represented in terms of atomic; orbitals (AO) or symmetry-adapted orbitals (SO). Further complications; come from the fact that a nearly linearly-dependent basis set will have; functions removed from it to prevent redundancies.

This plugin is an implementation of the RAS-nSF-IP/EA approach detailed ; in the paper by Houck et. al. [Houck:2019:2278]_. ; This approach handles systems with both spin and spatial degeneracies ; by combining the spin-flip (SF) [Krylov:2001:522]_; and ionization potential/electron affinity (IP/EA) [Nooijen:1995:3629]_ ; approaches. . The Psi4FockCI plugin allows one to perform spin-flip (SF), ionization ; potential (IP), and electron affinity (EA) calculations, as well as ; combined RAS-SF-IP/EA calculations, through the DETCI (:ref:`sec:ci`) module. Installation; ~~~~~~~~~~~~. * Download the plugin from the GitHub repository:. .. code-block:: bash. >>> git clone https://github.com/shannonhouck/psi4fockci.git. * Once downloaded, the plugin can be installed as follows:. .. code-block:: bash. >>> cd {top-level-psi4fockci-directory}; >>> python -m pip install . Sample Input; ~~~~~~~~~~~~. To run a CAS-nSF-IP/EA calculation, start with a molecule with the ; correct charge and multiplicity for the reference state (i.e. some ; state well-represented by a single reference). Then, run an energy ; calculation, passing in the charge and multiplicity of the ; desired state; the number of spin-flips and IP/EA will be automatically ; determined based on this input. If additional excitations outside of the ; RAS II space are desired, one can set the level of external ; excitations using the ``conf_space`` keyword. A sample input file for a RAS(h)-2SF-IP calculation is shown below:. .. code-block:: python. molecule {; 0 7; N 0.0 0.0 0.0; N 0.0 0.0 1.3; symmetry c1; }. set {; basis cc-pVDZ; }. energy('psi4fockci', new_charge=1, new_multiplicity=1, conf_space=""h""); ; Note that for calculations involving IP/EA, inclusion of hole (for IP)",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/plugin_psi4fockci.rst:2316,plugin,plugin,2316,doc/sphinxman/source/plugin_psi4fockci.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/plugin_psi4fockci.rst,1,['plugin'],['plugin']

Next comes a slightly; unusual-looking line, ``ecp = {}``. This is Python's way of initializing; a ""dictionary"". We're going to use this dictionary to store the; counterpoise-corrected energies as they become available. A dictionary is; like an array, but we can index it using strings or floating-point numbers; instead of integers if we want. Here, we will index it using; floating-point numbers, namely, the ``R`` values. This winds up being; slightly more elegant than a regular array in later parts of the input; file. The next section, beginning with ``for R in Rvals:``, loops over the; interatomic distances, ``R``, in our array ``Rvals``. In Python,; loops need to be indented, and each line in the loop has to be indented; by the same amount. The first line in the loop, ``dimer.R = R``,; sets the Z-matrix variable ``R`` of the molecule called ``dimer``; to the ``R`` value extracted from the ``Rvals`` array. The next line,; ``ecp[R] = energy('ccsd(t)', bsse_type='cp')``, computes the counterpoise-corrected; CCSD(T) energy and places it in the ``ecp`` dictionary with ``R`` as; the index. Note we didn't need to specify ghost atoms, and we didn't need; to call the monomer and dimer computations separately. The built-in; Psithon function :py:func:`~psi4.driver.driver_nbody.nbody` does it all for us, automatically. Near the very end of the output file, the counterpoise correction Python; function will print a nice summary of the results of the counterpoise; computation (the energies of the dimer, of monomer 1 with the ghost functions; of monomer 2, of monomer 2 with the ghost functions of monomer 1, and the; overall counterpoise-corrected interaction energy)::.

If tests fail that pass when run alone, you've got a function of the same name changing state or some similar correctable phenomenon. A few notes on test labels:. * For every new test file, add ``pytestmark = [pytest.mark.psi, pytest.mark.api]`` at the top.; This ensures that every test has the ``psi`` mark and every PsiAPI test has the ``api`` mark to contrast with PSIthon tests with ``cli`` mark. * There are individual ""marks"" that can be added to whole tests or parts; of parameterized tests so that they can be run by category (``pytest -m <mark>``; vs. ``ctest -L <mark>``) rather than just by name (``pytest -k <name_fragment>``; vs. ``ctest -R <name_fragment>``). Far more complicated logic is allowed than for; CTest: ``pytest -m ""dftd3 and not api and not long""``. * The most important marks are ""quick"" and ""long"" that opt tests into the quick CI suite or out of; the normal full suite. Mark with a decorator for the full test or the; marks argument in a parameterized test. Search ""mark"" in the test suite; for examples. Use ""quick"" freely for tests that cover functionality and; are under 15s. Use ""long"" sparingly to winnow out the longest examples,; particularly those over a minute.

Modifiability,"files, restart; .. _`sec:Scratch`:. Scratch Files; =============. One very important part of user configuration at the end of the; installation process; is to tell |PSIfour| where to write its temporary; (""scratch"") files. Electronic structure packages like |PSIfour| can; create rather large temporary disk files. It is very important to ; ensure that |PSIfour| is writing its temporary files to a disk drive; physically attached to the computer running the computation. If it; is not, it will significantly slow down the program and the network.; By default, |PSIfour| will write temporary files to ``/tmp``, but this; directory is often not large enough for typical computations. Therefore,; you need to (a) make sure there is a sufficiently large directory on a; locally attached disk drive (100GB--1TB or more, depending on the size of; the molecules to be studied) and (b) tell |PSIfour| the path to this; directory.

Because; `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ provides such a rich set of features for efficient linear; algebra, Fourier transforms, and general tensor manipulations, a massive number; of methods can be easily implemented very easily using that library. To; facilitate this workflow, |PSIfour| exports key quantities such as integrals,; densities and molecular orbitals in NumPy format. From this point, the; programmer can simply call the appropriate |PSIfour| functions to compute the; desired input quantities, retrieve them in NumPy format, and then write the; remaining code using standard Python and/or NumPy syntax. This approach does; not require any recompilation of code, resulting in a particularly facile; development workflow. Detailed examples and tutorials are available in the; `Psi4NumPy <https://github.com/psi4/psi4numpy>`_ repository. .. _`sec:prog_plugins`:. Avoiding the need to modify Psi4, using plugins; -----------------------------------------------. In the early days when |PSIfour| was still primarily a C++ code, development; was very cumbersome due to a lengthy build process. To expedite development, a; plugin system was developed. This plugin machinery allows developers to access; the classes defined in the innards of |PSIfour|, with only the small plugin; code requiring recompilation during development. The resulting lightweight; code can be maintained and distributed independently of |PSIfour|, making this; a good strategy for development, especially in cases where tighter integration; of the new code with existing |PSIfour| machinery is required than that; afforded by the Numpy based strategy outlined in the :ref:`sec:prog_psi4numpy`; section.

Modifiability,"ifting and the code is easy to; implement entirely in the Python layer. In the case where the matrix operation; is non-standard and requires some specialized code to handle disk-based; storage, the decision to write in Python is less clear cut. It is certainly; possible to write these out-of-core routines using Numpy primitives, but there; are a number of tools in |PSIfour| already to perform tasks like these that are; required, *e.g.*, for cluster. In this case, a good design would be to write a; simple piece of code in the C++ layer that performs the matrix operation on a; given input, using the I/O routines available in |PSIfour| and the parallelism; afforded by OpenMP, and to make that code available to the front end as; described in :ref:`sec:prog_tour-exposing`. The Python layer could then be; responsible for obtaining the input data and calling this C++ code to do the; manipulations, allowing each language layer to handle the subset of the work; that caters to their individual strengths. A number of concrete examples of this workflow exist in the code already. For; finite difference computations of energy derivatives, the logic to determine; the type of stencil and which displacements are needed is not going to be rate; limiting for any reasonable quantum mechanical energy function. Therefore,; doing that work in the Python layer is a good idea, as it allows the many; Python tools for farming out *embarrassingly parallel* workloads to be used,; while the C++ layer can be used to implement the energy function to be; differentiated. In SCF, we have a number of sources of external embedding potentials that could; enter the calculation.

It's actually good practice for interacting with other open-source projects, where you don't have the advantage of knowing or working with the contributors. Before venturing into projects on GitHub where you don't know the maintainers, it doesn't hurt to read https://snarky.ca/setting-expectations-for-open-source-participation/ . b) Psi4 is a learning tool for all involved, so partial reviews in areas of confidence and questions and comments on PRs in general are encouraged. c) Approving before CI completes is fine, though it can be mildly personally embarrassing when CI catches something you didn't. d) All main branches (master and `1.N.x` maintenance) are protected by GitHub, including administrators, so even with write access, no one can accidentally push (master) or rewrite the history (master and maintenance). e) PR owners who also have maintainer status can merge their PRs as GitHub enforces two external reviews. f) Unless there's been a lot of discussion on core-dev about merge order, generally the 2nd positive reviewer merges the PR. Also fine to add review and leave merge for later. g) Presently only Azure is set up as a required-to-merge service. Incomplete GHA Ecosystem or Docs won't block merging, but we do usually let it complete before merging unless it's a trivial PR. h) We don't enforce branches to be up to date before merging since that'd be a lot of extra CI time and coordination when merging several PRs in a day. So, if a PR hasn't been updated in a while, and a reviewer is nervous about PR interference, fine to ask submitter to rebase.

This means that a basis set; rather complete in Hartree--Fock (or one-particle) sense; is absolutely mandatory for meaningful computations with the MP2-R12; method. The user is strongly urged to read literature on; linear R12 methods before using |PSIfour| to compute MP2-R12; energies. * More robust, two-basis versions; of the MP2-R12 method, also known as the auxiliary basis; MP2-R12 method, have been implemented; in a publicly available Massively Parallel Quantum Chemistry (MPQC); package (see \url{http://aros.ca.sandia.gov/~cljanss/mpqc/}).; The two-basis version of the MP2-R12 method is a theoretically more; sound approach, and thus should be preferred to the single-basis method.; In some situations, however, it may make sense to use; the single-basis method.

All of these should be doubles- let the input; parser handle the flexible input format. * Diis should have a boolean ``DIIS`` (not do_diis, not use_diis) to turn; on/off diis extrapolation, a ``DIIS_MIN_VECS`` and ``DIIS_MAX_VECS`` for; minimum and maximum number of diis vectors to use, and a ``DIIS_START``; which is the iteration at which to start saving vec",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/manage_addon.rst:7696,sandbox,sandbox,7696,doc/sphinxman/source/manage_addon.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/manage_addon.rst,2,"['plugin', 'sandbox']","['plugins', 'sandbox']"

Creating New Plugins; ====================. Modular Approach to Development; -------------------------------. It is slightly cumbersome to the development cycle to recompile |PSIfour|; every time a change is made to the C++ code.; It's also daunting to new developers if they're required to; learn the structure of the source tree, executable initialization code,; and makefile systems in the existing code in order to add new features,; which was never a problem with Psi3 due to the independent; nature of the modules. To overcome these problems, |PSIfour| now has a; useful plugin feature. This allows codes to be developed as standalone; entities, which are compiled independently of the Psi source, but can; still link against Psi's vast library. The plugins can be loaded at; run-time from any location. .. _`sec:newplugins`:.

These can be; accessed through the :py:func:`~psi4.core.get_variable` function. For example, after; performing a density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component; scaled energy and the unscaled MP2 energy are made available::. e_mp2 = get_variable('MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'); e_scs_mp2 = get_variable('SCS-MP2 TOTAL ENERGY'). Each module and the Python driver set PSI variables over the course of a; calculation. The values for all can be printed in the output file with; the input file command :py:func:`~psi4.core.print_variables`. Note that PSI variables; are cleared at the start of each :py:func:`~psi4.driver.energy`, etc. in an input; file by :py:func:`~psi4.core.clean_variables()`.; So if you run in a single input file a STO-3G FCI followed by a; aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a :py:func:`~psi4.core.print_variables` command, the; last will include :psivar:`SCF TOTAL ENERGY` but not; :psivar:`FCI TOTAL ENERGY`.; The entire dictionary of PSI variables can be obtained through; :py:func:`~psi4.core.get_variables`. .. _`sec:returnvals`:.

Modifiability,"lated CI wavefunctions that can be helpful in more ; challenging cases such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions. The CI; code is based on the fast, determinant-based string formalism; of Handy [Handy:1980]_. It can solve for restricted active space; configuration interaction (RAS CI) wavefunctions as described by Olsen,; Roos, Jorgensen, and Aa. Jensen [Olsen:1988]_. Excitation-class; selected multi-reference CI wavefunctions, such as second-order CI,; can be formulated as RAS CI's. A RAS CI selects determinants for the; model space as those which have no more than :math:`n` holes in the lowest set; of orbitals (called RAS I) and no more than :math:`m` electrons in the highest; set of orbitals (called RAS III). An intermediate set of orbitals, if; present (RAS II), has no restrictions placed upon it. All determinants; satisfying these rules are included in the RAS CI. The DETCI module is also very efficient at computing full configuration; interaction; wavefunctions, and it is used in this capacity in the complete-active-space; self-consistent-field (CASSCF) code. It can also perform approximate; CASSCF computations in which one uses RAS restrictions on the CI excitations,; rather than doing a full CI in the active space. This is called a ; RASSCF. CASSCF and RASSCF computations are types of multi-configurational; self-consistent-field procedures, and are described in :ref:`sec:mcscf`. As mentioned above, the DETCI module is designed for challenging; chemical systems for which simple CISD is not suitable. Because; CI wavefunctions which go beyond CISD (such as RAS CI) are fairly complex,; typically the DETCI code will be used in cases where the; tradeoffs between computational expense and completeness of the; model space are nontrivial.

Modifiability,"ll determinants are connected to each other by no more than two; excitations. In practice, this usually means that the active space can have; at most two particles, or at most two holes. Examples would include ; CAS(2,2), CAS(2,8), CAS(4,3), etc., where CAS(n,m) refers to a; complete-active-space configuration interaction (CASCI) reference with n; electrons in m orbitals. If the user specifies active spaces that do not fit; these limitations, then the code will still run, but some relevant; determinants will be missing, and the answer obtained will be an approximation; to the true Mk-MRCC procedure. The PSIMRCC code itself does not perform orbital optimization. Hence, the; references used might be considered CASCI references, but not CASSCF; references (CASSCF implies that the orbitals have been optimized specifically; to minimize the energy of the CASCI reference). However, if one wishes to; use two-configuration self-consistent-field (TCSCF) orbitals, those can; be obtained using the multi-configuration self-consistent-field (MCSCF); component of PSIMRCC (specifying |mcscf__reference| to be ``twocon``).; This is suitable for describing diradicals. Otherwise, one may use RHF or; ROHF orbitals as input to PSIMRCC. Due to a current limitation in the code,; one must obtain orbitals using PSIMRCC's MCSCF module regardless of what; orbital type is chosen, ``twocon``, ``rhf``, or ``rohf``. An example of the; MCSCF input is given below. PSIMRCC is most commonly used for low-spin cases (singlets or open-shell; singlets). It is capable of performing computations on higher spin states; (*e.g.*, triplets), but in general, not all the required matrix elements have; been coded for high-spin cases, meaning that results will correspond to an; approximate Mk-MRCC computation for high-spin cases.

Modifiability,"luate the Kohn--Sham potentials and energies to a high degree of accuracy. The; evaluation of these numerical integrals can be made to be linear scaling with a; reasonable amount of cleverness (mostly related to the fact that the basis; functions decay exponentially), meaning that the Coulomb and diagonalization; steps become rate limiting. This enormous potential speed gain over Hartree--Fock; with potentially exact treatment of electron correlation for ""free"" was one of; the primary motivations for KS-DFT's adoption by chemists in the late 1980s and; early 1990s. Unfortunately, local KS-DFT exhibits several spectacular failures, most of which; stem from the exponential decay of the local Kohn--Sham potential, which cannot; encapsulate long-range information in the exchange and correlation holes. In the; exchange hole, this manifests as the problem of Many-Electron Self-Interaction; Error (MSIE), which presents as spurious low-lying charge transfer states in; excited-state calculations, eventual metallic breakdown in extended insulators,; poor thermochemistry, and complete lack of a derivative discontinuity in the; chemical potential as integer particle numbers are crossed. On the correlation; side, this is primarily observed in the inability of KS-DFT to treat dispersion; interactions. Generalized Kohn--Sham (GKS) functionals incorporate long-range information into; the functional through orbital-dependent contributions, and are designed to; combat the failures of local KS-DFT, particularly the MSIE on the exchange side.; Note that these functionals are often referred to as ""implicit"" density; functionals, as the orbitals are themselves functionals of the Kohn--Sham; potential. The simplest form of an exchange-side GKS is the global hybrid ansatz, in which; some fraction of the exact Hartree--Fock exchange of the noninteracting; quasiparticles is added to the functional, with the local part of the exchange; functional decreased by the corresponding amount.

The correct value of :math:`M_s` is easily enforced; by fixing the number of alpha and beta electrons to be constant across all determinants ; selected for the CI computation. However, determinant-based codes like DETCI do; not necessarily enforce the correct spin :math:`S`.

The de facto standard for |PSIfour|; involves using threaded BLAS/LAPACK (particularly Intel's excellent MKL package); for most tensor-like operations, OpenMP for more general operations, and C++; ``std::thread`` for some special-case operations. Note: Using OpenMP alone is a really; bad idea. The developers make little to no effort to explicitly parallelize; operations which are already easily threaded by MKL or other threaded BLAS. Less; than 20% of the threaded code in |PSIfour| uses OpenMP, the rest is handled by; parallel DGEMM and other library routines. From this point forward, it is; assumed that you have compiled |PSIfour| with OpenMP and MKL (Note that it is; possible to use g++ or another compiler and yet still link against MKL). Control of threading in |PSIfour| can be accomplished at a variety of levels,; ranging from global environment variables to direct control of thread count in; the input file, to even directives specific to each model.

Thanks primarily to the efforts of Curt; Janssen (Sandia Labs, Livermore) and Ed Seidl (LLNL), the package was; ported to UNIX systems, and substantially improved with new input formats; and a C-based I/O system. Beginning in 1999, an extensive effort was begun to develop \PSIthree\; --- a {\tt PSI} suite with a completely new face.

Modifiability,"ogonalization; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. One of the first steps in the SCF procedure is the determination of an; orthogonal basis (known as the OSO basis) from the atomic orbital; basis (known as the AO basis). The Molecular Orbital basis (MO basis); is then built as a particular unitary transformation of the OSO; basis. In |PSIfour|, the determination of the OSO basis is; accomplished via either symmetric, canonical, or partial Cholesky; orthogonalization. Symmetric orthogonalization uses the symmetric inverse square root of; the overlap matrix for the orthogonalization matrix. Use of symmetric; orthogonalization always yields the same number of OSO functions (and; thereby MOs) as AO functions. However, this may lead to numerical; problems if the overlap matrix has small eigenvalues, which may occur; for large systems or for systems where diffuse basis sets are used. This problem may be avoided by using canonical orthogonalization, in; which an asymmetric inverse square root of the overlap matrix is; formed, with numerical stability enhanced by the elimination of; eigenvectors corresponding to very small eigenvalues. As a few; combinations of AO basis functions may be discarded, the number of; canonical-orthogonalized OSOs and MOs may be slightly smaller than the; number of AOs. When the basis set is too overcomplete, the eigendecomposition of the; overlap matrix is no longer numerically stable. In this case the; partial Cholesky decomposition can be used to pick a subset of basis; functions that span a sufficiently complete set, see; [Lehtola:2019:241102]_ and [Lehtola:2020:032504]_. This subset can then; be orthonormalized as usual; the rest of the basis functions are; hidden from the calculation. The Cholesky approach allows reaching; accurate energies even in the presence of significant linear; dependencies [Lehtola:2020:134108]_. In |PSIfour|, symmetric orthogonalization is used by default, unless; the smallest overlap eigenvalue falls below the user-supplied double; ",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/scf.rst:14071,enhance,enhanced,14071,doc/sphinxman/source/scf.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/scf.rst,1,['enhance'],['enhanced']
Modifiability,"olecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results. The CI code in |PSIfour| is described in detail in ; [Sherrill:1999:CI]_. For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; |PSIfour| is not optimized for CISD computations, and it uses data structures; that are particularly inefficient for CISD and may result in the program; running out of memory and crashing for CISD except on very small molecules.; Instead, DETCI was designed to be efficient; in handling more highly correlated CI wavefunctions that can be helpful in more ; challenging cases such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions. The CI; code is based on the fast, determinant-based string formalism; of Handy [Handy:1980]_. It can solve for restricted active space; configuration interaction (RAS CI) wavefunctions as described by Olsen,; Roos, Jorgensen, and Aa. Jensen [Olsen:1988]_. Excitation-class; selected multi-reference CI wavefunctions, such as second-order CI,; can be formulated as RAS CI's. A RAS CI selects determinants for the; model space as those which have no more than :math:`n` holes in the lowest set; of orbitals (called RAS I) and no more than :math:`m` electrons in the highest; set of orbitals (called RAS III). An intermediate set of orbitals, if; present (RAS II), has no restrictions placed upon it. All determinants; satisfying these rules are included in the RAS CI. The DETCI module is also very efficient at computing full configuration; interaction; wavefunctions, and it is used in this capacity in the complete-active-space; self-consistent-field (CASSCF) code. It can also perform approximate; CASSCF computations in which one uses RAS restrictions on the CI excitations,; rather than doing a full CI in the active space. This is called a ; RASSCF.

The resulting lightweight; code can be maintained and distributed independently of |PSIfour|, making this; a good strategy for development, especially in cases where tighter integration; of the new code with existing |PSIfour| machinery is required than that; afforded by the Numpy based strategy outlined in the :ref:`sec:prog_psi4numpy`; section.

However, there is; one disk transpose of the :math:`(Q|ov)` tensor in the RHF-MP2 algorithm; [two for UHF-MP2 and ROHF-MBPT(2)], so more memory will reduce seek times.; If you notice DFMP2 using more memory than allowed, it is possible that; the threaded three-index ERI computers are using too much overhead memory.; Set the |dfmp2__DF_ints_num_threads| to a smaller number to prevent this; in this section (does not affect threaded efficiency in the rest of the; code). * DFMP2 likes disk. At a minimum, :math:`2Qov` doubles are required for; RHF-MP2, and :math:`4Qov` doubles are required for UHF-MP2. * DFMP2 likes threads. Some of the formation of the :math:`(Q|ov)` tensor; relies on threaded BLAS (such as MKL) for efficiency. The main; :math:`{\cal O}(N^5)` step is done via small/medium-sized DGEMMs inside of; OpenMP, so make sure to set the :envvar:`OMP_NESTED` environment variable; to ``FALSE`` to prevent thread thrash (or just as well, do not define; :envvar:`OMP_NESTED` at all). * Freezing core is good for both efficiency and correctness purposes.; Freezing virtuals is not recommended. The DFMP2 module will remind you how; many frozen/active orbitals it is using in a section just below the title. * ROHF-MBPT(2) may be preferred to UHF-MP2, as the latter can suffer from; severe spin contamination in some cases. * MP2 is not suitable for systems with multireference character. The; orbital energies will come together and an explosion will occur. .

David Sherrill. *Module:* :ref:`Keywords <apdx:detci>`, :ref:`PSI Variables <apdx:detci_psivar>`, :source:`DETCI <psi4/src/psi4/detci>`. Configuration interaction (CI) is one of the most general ways to; improve upon Hartree--Fock theory by adding a description of the; correlated motions of electrons. Simply put, a CI wavefunction; is a linear combination of Slater determinants (or spin-adapted; configuration state functions), with the linear coefficients being; determined variationally via diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the; given subspace of determinants. For a ""single-reference"" CI based; on reference function :math:`| \Phi_0 \rangle`, we can write the CI expansion as; follows:. .. math:: | \Psi \rangle = c_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle; + \sum_i^{\rm occ} \sum_a^{\rm vir} c_i^a | \Phi_i^a \rangle; + \sum_{i<j}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b}^{\rm vir} c_{ij}^{ab} ; | \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle; + \sum_{i<j<k}^{\rm occ} \sum_{a<b<c}^{\rm vir} c_{ijk}^{abc}; | \Phi_{ijk}^{abc} \rangle + \cdots; :label: CIexpansion. The simplest standard CI method that improves upon Hartree--Fock is a CI; that adds all singly :math:`| \Phi_i^a \rangle` and doubly ; :math:`| \Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle`; substituted determinants (CISD) to the reference determinant; :math:`| \Phi_0 \rangle`. The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules.

A function in :source:`tests/pytests/conftest.py` does this automatically between every test.; * Especially if using data or functions from outside a test, run a variety of tests at different ``pytest -n <N>`` levels to mix up test ordering. If tests fail that pass when run alone, you've got a function of the same name changing state or some similar correctable phenomenon. A few notes on test labels:. * For every new test file, add ``pytestmark = [pytest.mark.psi, pytest.mark.api]`` at the top.; This ensures that every test has the ``psi`` mark and every PsiAPI test has the ``api`` mark to contrast with PSIthon tests with ``cli`` mark. * There are individual ""marks"" that can be added to whole tests or parts; of parameterized tests so that they can be run by category (``pytest -m <mark>``; vs. ``ctest -L <mark>``) rather than just by name (``pytest -k <name_fragment>``; vs. ``ctest -R <name_fragment>``). Far more complicated logic is allowed than for; CTest: ``pytest -m ""dftd3 and not api and not long""``. * The most important marks are ""quick"" and ""long"" that opt tests into the quick CI suite or out of; the normal full suite. Mark with a decorator for the full test or the; marks argument in a parameterized test. Search ""mark"" in the test suite; for examples. Use ""quick"" freely for tests that cover functionality and; are under 15s. Use ""long"" sparingly to winnow out the longest examples,; particularly those over a minute.

How to name orbital dimensions; ------------------------------. There are a number of different names used to refer to the basis set size.; These may seem redundant, but they have subtly different meanings, as; detailed below. A calculation can use either pure (5D, 7F, 9G, etc.) basis functions or; Cartesian (6D, 10F, 15G, etc.), as dictated by the input file / basis set; specification. Also, the basis can be represented in terms of atomic; orbitals (AO) or symmetry-adapted orbitals (SO). Further complications; come from the fact that a nearly linearly-dependent basis set will have; functions removed from it to prevent redundancies. With all of these; factors in mind, here are the conventions used internally:. * nao |w---w| The number of atomic orbitals in Cartesian representation.; * nso |w---w| The number of atomic orbitals but in the pure representation if the current basis uses pure functions, number of Cartesian AOs otherwise.; * nbf |w---w| The number of basis functions, which is the same as nso.; * nmo |w---w| The number of basis functions, after projecting out redundancies in the basis. When molecular symmetry is utilized, a small array of sizes per irrep is; usually allocated on the stack, and is named by augmenting the name above; with a pi (per-irrep), e.g. nmopi. Note that the number of irreps is; always the singular nirrep, and that the index variable h is always used; in a for-loop traverse of irreps. ..",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/prog_blas.rst:13327,adapt,adapted,13327,doc/sphinxman/source/prog_blas.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/prog_blas.rst,1,['adapt'],['adapted']

In short, the TOC design hides all information about; the global structure of the file from the programmer and; allows him/her to be concerned only with the structure of individual; entries.; II. The structure of libpsio; file. The first element in every libpsio file is a single; integer, toclen, indicating the number of entries in the; file. Each entry is stored together with its TOC ""header"", i.e., the; keyword-string and global-address information for the data. When the; file is opened, the first entry's TOC header is read from the file; into an in-core TOC list. If a second entry exists, the; ending-address data from the first entry is used to lseek(); to the next entry, whose header is read into the in-core TOC, and so; on. If a new entry is added or an existing entry is modified (e.g.,; extended), both the in-core TOC and the corresponding TOC header; on-disk are updated automatically. This prevents most cases of; corruption of the file in case of a program crash. Apart from the toclen integer, the file itself is viewed by; the library as a series of pages, each of which contains an identical; number of bytes. The global address of the beginning of a given entry; is stored on the TOC as a page/offset pair comprised of the starting; page and byte-offset on that page where the data reside.; The entry-relative page/offset addresses which the programmer; must provide work in exactly the same manner, but the 0/0 (PSIO_ZERO); position is taken to be the beginning of the desired entry rather than; the beginning of the file. II. The user interface. All of the functions needed to carry out basic I/O are described in; this subsection. Proper declarations of these routines are provided; by the header file psio.h.

The PSIO_ZERO defined as a global variable provides a; convenient input for the 0/0 page/offset.; III. Manipulating the table of contents.

NB: Do not use this function if you are not a PSI3; expert.

The; immediate solution, however, is to form symlinks between the; library names that exist and the names expected.

The; location of the plugin directory must be included in :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`,; either externally in the calling shell or defined in the input file.; This is usually done by manipulating :envvar:`PSIPATH`. Then,; the plugin can be loaded as ``import myplugin`` and executed as; ``energy('myplugin')``.

Loops; =====. Python provides many control structures, any of which can be used within |PSIfour|; input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can; be used:. .. code-block:: none. basis_sets = [""cc-pVDZ"", ""cc-pVTZ"", ""cc-pVQZ""]; for basis_set in basis_sets:; set basis = $basis_set; energy('scf'). The declaration of ``basis_sets`` is completely standard Python, as is the next; line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor; wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that ``basis_set`` is a; Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign. . The geometry specification supports delayed initialization of variable,; which permits potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the; angle and bond length in water::. molecule h2o{; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; }; ; Rvals = [0.9, 1.0, 1.1]; Avals = range(102, 106, 2); ; set basis cc-pvdz; set scf e_convergence=11; for R in Rvals:; h2o.R = R; for A in Avals:; h2o.A = A; energy('scf'). The declarations of ``Rvals`` and ``Avals`` are both completely standard Python syntax.; Having named our molecule ``h2o`` we can then set the values of ``R`` and ``A`` within; the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python; variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables; with the ``set`` keyword. Cartesian geometries, because of details of the geometry update process,; need to be specified within the loop(s) along with their basis set when; geometry scans are performed. See :srcsample:`scf4` for analogous Z-matrix; and Cartiesian scans. .. _`sec:resultsTables`:.

Even more control is possible in certain circumstances. For instance, the; threaded generation of AO density-fitted integrals involves a memory requirement; proportional to the number of threads. This requirement may exceed the total; memory of a small-memory node if all threads are involved in the generation of; these integrals. For general DF algorithms, the user may specify::. set MODULE_NAME df_ints_num_threads n. to explicitly control the number of threads used for integral formation.

All files are written to the; designated scratch :ref:`numbered by content <apdx:psiFiles>` and labeled; with the process id, then are deleted at the end of the computation,; unless otherwise instructed by the user. A Python callable handle to the |PSIfour| I/O management routines is available,; and is called ``psi4_io``. To instruct the I/O manager to send all files to; another location, say ``/scratch/user``, add the following command to your input; file: ::. psi4_io.set_default_path('/scratch/user'). For batch jobs running through a queue, it might be more convenient to use an; environmental variable (in this case ``$MYSCRATCH``) to set the scratch directory;; the following code will do that::. import os; scratch_dir = os.environ.get('MYSCRATCH'); if scratch_dir:; psi4_io.set_default_path(scratch_dir + '/'). Individual files can be sent to specific locations. For example, file 12; contains information about the internal coordiantes of a geometry optimization.; The user may want to retain this in the working directory; (*i.e.*, where |PSIfour| was launched from) to analyze the optimization. This is; accomplished by the commands below::. psi4_io.set_specific_path(12, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(12, True). # equivalent to above; psi4_io.set_specific_path(PSIF_INTCO, './'); psi4_io.set_specific_retention(PSIF_INTCO, True).

The Z-matrix; coordinate system was designed to provide chemists with an intuitive method for; guessing structures in terms of bond lengths and angles. While Z-matrix input is; intuitive for small molecules with few degrees of freedom, it quickly becomes; laborious as the system size grows. To obtain a reasonable starting guess; geometry, |PSIfour| can take a chemical name as input; this is then used; to attempt to retrieve Cartesian coordinates from the [PubChem]_ database. For example, to run a computation on benzene, we can use the following molecule specification::. molecule benzene {; pubchem:benzene; }. If the computer is connected to the internet, the above code will instruct; |PSIfour| to search PubChem for a starting structure.

By default, |PSIfour| assumes that 500 MiB of memory are available. While this is; enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if; more is available. To specify memory, the ``memory`` keyword should be used. The following; lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 GB of RAM is available; to |PSIfour|::. # all equivalent. memory 2 GB; ; memory 2000 MB; ; memory 2000000 kB. Please note that memory can be specified both in IEC binary units (1 KiB = 1024 bytes) and SI units (1 kB = 1000 bytes). |PSIfour| recognizes and obeys both of them correctly. The units are not case sensitive (Kb and KB are equivalent to kB). By default, |PSIfour| performs a ""sanity check"" when parsing Psithon input files, enforcing a minimum memory requirement of 250 MiB. While it is generally not recomennded to do so, expert users can bypass this check by directly setting the number of bytes availble to |PSIfour|::. # setting available memory to 2 MB; set_memory_bytes(2000000). Please note that this memory setting only governs the maximal memory; usage of the major data structures, and actual total memory usage; is slightly higher. This is usually a negligible amount, except when; setting tiny memory allowances. One convenient way to override the |PSIfour| default memory is to place a; memory command in the |psirc| file (Sec. :ref:`sec:psirc`). For example,; the following makes the default memory 2 GB. ::. set_memory(2000000000).

As the cost of Full CI scales exponentially with respect to the number of; active orbitals it is often advantageous to neglect orbitals that do not; exhibit strong correlation. These orbitals are variationally optimized; simultaneously with the CI coefficients and known as Multi-Configurational; Self-Consistent Field (MCSCF). The most commonly used MCSCF procedure is the; complete-active-space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) approach [Roos:1980]_,; which includes all possible determinants (with the proper symmetry) that can be; formed by distributing a set of active electrons among a set of active; orbitals. The MCSCF module performs CASSCF optimization of molecular orbitals; via a two-step procedure in which the CI coefficients and orbitals are; optimized in an alternating manner. The program uses a fairly simple; approximate orbital Hessian [Chaban:1997:88]_ and a Newton-Raphson update,; accelerated by Pulay's DIIS procedure [Pulay:1980]_.

Larger Calculations; -------------------. Here are a few recommendations for carrying out extended integral-direct MP2 and; MP2-R12 calculations with |PSIfour|: . * While the integral-direct MP2 algorithm doesn't need any; significant disk storage,; the integral-direct algorithm for the MP2-R12 energy; stores the transformed integrals to disk, hence very large; computations will require a lot of disk space. In general; the storage requirement is :math:`16 o^2N^2` bytes, where :math:`o`; is the number of occupied orbitals, and :math:`N` is the size of the basis. * If there is not enough memory to perform the computation in one pass,; the program will do multiple passes through the entire set of integrals,; hence your computation will run that many times longer.; In such case, find the machine with the most memory and processors available. * On SMP machines, set the {\tt NUM\_THREADS} to the number of; processors available for the job, or, if all processors are allocated for; your job, set {\tt NUM\_THREADS} to {\em twice} the number of processors; you have. Modern operating systems schedulers are usually very efficient; at handling multithreaded programs, so the overhead of thread context; switching is not significant, but using more threads may lead to better; load balancing, and lower execution times. For example, on a 32-processor; IBM eServer p690 we found that the optimal number of threads was 128.; For the optimal performance, do a few runs with different number of threads; and see which number works best.; Avoid excessively large; number of threads, as this descreases the net amount of memory available to; the computation and thus may ",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/attic/mp2.rst:6603,perform,perform,6603,doc/sphinxman/source/attic/mp2.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/attic/mp2.rst,1,['perform'],['perform']

Because of the limitations on geometry specification for; optimizations in Cfour, optking-driven optimizations are the *only*; optimizations allowed in the P4C4 interface. (The exception is sandwich; mode, which, of course, permits optimizations with the Cfour optimizer.); Below is an example of a geometry optimization::. memory 200 mb; ; molecule {; O; H 1 R; H 1 R 2 A; ; R=0.958; A=104.5; }; ; set {; ; cfour_CALC_level CCSD(T); cfour_BASIS DZP; cfour_CC_CONV 12; cfour_LINEQ_CONV 12; cfour_SCF_CONV 12; g_convergence cfour; }. optimize('cfour').

The behavior of the electronic energy and HOMO energy across fractional numbers; of electrons is extremely useful for elucidating the MSIE behavior of various; functional technologies. |PSIfour| features an efficient fractional-particle DFT; code, written into the UKS spin specialization. Due to a combination of DIIS and; reuse of integrals/guess orbitals across a range of fractional occupations, this; code is able to perform fractional occupation curves for systems with up to 60; atoms, across a wide range of the particle number :math:`N`. Two python macros exist for this code. The first is :py:func:`~psi4.driver.frac.frac_traverse`, which is; used to investigate the fractional occupation behavior within one electron above; and below the neutral.

Shell blocking; .............. Each underlying integral engine knows whether it will use blocks, and will set up; the metadata automatically. Instead of looping over individual shells, the; user should loop over blocks supplied by the integral object; these blocks will; be just a single shell quartet combination for the case where blocking is not; used. It is simple to loop over pairs within each block using C++11 syntax, as; demonstrated in the code snippet above. Only shell pairs with significant; overlap are included in the shell block information, making this an efficient; way to loop over non-negligible terms. Permutational symmetry; ...................... The pairs within each block are optimized for efficiency. First, they are; screened during the integral object's creation to ensure that only terms with; appreciable overlap are stored. Second, only P,Q combinations that are; permutationally unique are stored, ordered with the higher angular momentum; first. Therefore care must be taken to ensure that the missing permutations; are correctly accounted for when processing the integrals within the loop.

We use an octree; algorithm for this procedure, which produces a good balance between spatial; compactness of each block (which helps achieve linear scaling due to the; exponential decay of the basis functions), and retaining a large number of; points in each block (which helps keep the FLOP rate up by allowing for a; reasonably large amount of BLAS3/BLAS2 work to form the densities and potentials; in each block). For each block, a united set of significant basis functions is; determined by the cutoff radius of each shell of basis functions. The size of; this cutoff radius (and thereby the accuracy of the density/potential; evaluation) can be varied by setting the |scf__dft_basis_tolerance|, which; defaults to 1E-12. We are still exploring optimizations of the octree algorithm; and the basis cutoffs, but it is likely that significant speed gains may be; realized by relaxing the basis cutoff tolerance, with negligible decrease in; accuracy. Small density values can introduce numerical instabilities with some functionals that; can result in trailing SCF convergence issues or even numerical failures (NaNs).; If the default settings of the LibXC library are insufficient, a custom value can be ; request by setting |scf__dft_density_tolerance|.

The LINK algorithm provides ; many of the benefits of integral-direct SCF algorithms, including no disk I/O, ; low memory usage, and effective parallelization. Additionally, the; LINK implementation scales well with system size ; while simultaneously providing a formally-exact computation of the ; Exchange term. See :ref:`sec:scflink` for more information. In some cases the above algorithms have multiple implementations that return; the same result, but are optimal under different molecules sizes and hardware; configurations. Psi4 will automatically detect the correct algorithm to run and; only expert users should manually select the below implementations. The DF; algorithm has the following two implementations. MEM_DF; A DF algorithm optimized around memory layout and is optimal as long as; there is sufficient memory to hold the three-index DF tensors in memory. This; algorithm may be faster for builds that require disk if SSDs are used.; DISK_DF; A DF algorithm (the default DF algorithm before Psi4 1.2) optimized to; minimize Disk IO by sacrificing some performance due to memory layout. Note that these algorithms have both in-memory and on-disk options, but; performance penalties up to a factor of 2.5 can be found if the incorrect; algorithm is chosen. It is therefore highly recommended that the keyword ""DF""; be selected in all cases so that the correct implementation can be selected by; |PSIfours| internal routines. Expert users can manually switch between MEM_DF and; DISK_DF; however, they may find documented exceptions during use as several; post SCF algorithms require a specific implementation.

DIIS [On by Default]; DIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock matrix together; with an error criterion based on the orbital gradient to produce an informed; estimate of the next Fock Matrix. DIIS is almost always necessary to converge; the SCF procedure and is therefore turned on by default. In rare cases, the; DIIS algorithm may need to be modified or turned off altogether, which may be; accomplished via :term:`options <DIIS (SCF)>`.; ADIIS [On by Default]; ADIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock and density matrices to produce an; informed estimate of the next Fock matrix. ADIIS estimates are based on minimizing; an energy estimate rather than zeroing the residual, so this performs best in the early; iterations. By default, Psi will start using ADIIS before blending the ADIIS step with; the DIIS step, eventually using the pure DIIS step. The closely-related EDIIS procedure; may be used instead by setting |scf__scf_initial_accelerator|. This is formally identical; to ADIIS for HF, but the methods will differ for more general DFT.; MOM [Off by Default]; MOM was developed to combat a particular class of convergence failure:; occupation flipping. In some cases, midway though the SCF procedure, a partially; converged orbital which should be occupied in the fully-optimized SCF solution; has a slightly higher orbital eigenvalue than some other orbital which should be; destined to be a virtual orbital. This results in the virtual orbital being; spuriously occupied for one or more iterations.

Performance," observed to lead, in some cases, to I-SAPT energy contributions that do not make ; physical sense, for example, to a strongly repulsive electrostatic energy between two fragments connected by an; intramolecular hydrogen bond. To overcome this issue, Luu and Patkowski proposed a reassignment of the linking electron pairs so that each fragment; (C and A/B) gets one electron [Luu:2023:356]_. This electron is placed on a hybrid orbital of the connecting atom; pointing in the direction of the interfragment bond. Several schemes for determining this link hybrid were proposed ; in [Luu:2023:356]_ and they all are implemented in |PSIfour|. We recommend the so-called *SIAO1* scheme,; ``fisapt_link_assignment siao1``, as it has been observed to provide consistently meaningful I-SAPT terms and a; smooth basis set convergence. The SIAO1 name implies that the projection to construct the link hybrids happens in the; intrinsic atomic orbital space (as opposed to the SAO1 method where the standard atomic orbital space is used), with; one iteration of fragment orbital optimization and link orbital orthogonalization, a process that very quickly ; achieves self-consistency. Altogether, the allowed values for |fisapt__fisapt_link_assignment| are ``c`` (default),; ``ab`` (the opposite of ``c`` where the entire linking pair is assigned to A/B), ``sao0``, ``sao1``, ``sao2``,; ``siao0``, ``siao1`` (recommended for all I-SAPT applications), and ``siao2`` (essentially identical to ``siao1`` but; slightly more expensive).

The general algorithm; for doing this in DETCI is inefficient compared to optimized; lower-order coupled-cluster codes and should not be used for CCSD,; where the CCENERGY module is much more efficient. For higher-order; CC (like CCSDT and beyond), the code is also not as efficient as the; MRCC code by K\ |a_acute|\ llay, to which |PSIfour| can interface (see Section; :ref:`sec:mrcc`); however, it may allow certain truncations of the model; space that might not be available presently in MRCC. For very small; systems, the code can be useful for testing of, for example, CCSDTQ or; its active-space CCSDtq analog [Piecuch:1999:6103]_.

These abnormal eigenvalues may lead to unphysical ; molecular properties such as vibrational frequencies. However, orbital-optimized MP2 (also MP3); will solve this N-representability problem by disregarding orbital response contribution of one-particle; density matrix. . Although the performance of coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) and orbital-optimized ; CCD (OD) is similar, the situation is different in the case of triples corrections, especially at stretched ; geometries [Bozkaya:2012:odtl]_. Bozkaya and Schaefer demonstrated that orbital-optimized coupled cluster based ; triple corrections, especially those of asymmetrics, provide significantly better potential energy curves than ; CCSD based triples corrections. . A lot of the functionality in OCC has been enabled with Density Fitting (DF) and Cholesky ; Decomposition (CD) techniques, which can greatly speed up calculations and reduce memory; requirements for typically negligible losses in accuracy. **NOTE**: As will be discussed later, all methods with orbital-optimization functionality have non-orbital ; optimized counterparts. Consequently, there arise two possible ways to call density-fitted MP2. In most; cases, users should prefer the DF-MP2 code described in the :ref:`DF-MP2 <sec:dfmp2>` section because it is; faster. If gradients are needed (like in a geometry optimization), then the procedures outlined hereafter; should be followed.; In general, choose the desired method, reference, and ERI type (*e.g.*,; ``set reference uhf``, ``set mp2_type df``, ``opt('mp2')``) and the most; efficient module will be selected automaticall",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/occ.rst:4253,optimiz,optimized,4253,doc/sphinxman/source/occ.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/occ.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimized']

For; open-shell molecules, we have a choice of unrestricted orbitals; (unrestricted Hartree--Fock, or UHF), or restricted orbitals (restricted; open-shell Hartree--Fock, or ROHF). Usually, UHF is a little easier to; converge (although it may be more susceptible to spin contamination than; ROHF). Geometry Optimization and Vibrational Frequency Analysis; ========================================================. The above examples were simple single-point energy computations; (as specified by the :py:func:`~psi4.driver.energy` function). Of course there are other; kinds of computations to perform, such as geometry optimizations and; vibrational frequency computations.

Running EFP ; ~~~~~~~~~~~~. EFP can be invoked in similar fashion as other theories provided in |PSIfour|.; For example, if you want to obtain the EFP interaction energy for benzene and two waters,; simply provide the following::. molecule {; efp c6h6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; --; efp h2o 4.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; --; efp h2o -4.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; }; ; energy('efp'). This computation involves purely EFP/EFP fragment interactions and is; performed entirely by the LIBEFP library. |PSIfour| can also handle mixed; systems of quantum mechanical (QM) and EFP fragments through the native; :ref:`SCF <sec:scf>` code augmented by calls to the LIBEFP library. For; example, turning one of the waters in the example above into a QM; fragment is shown below. ::. molecule {; efp c6h6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; --; O 4.0 0.0 0.0; H 4.7 0.7 0.0; H 3.3 -0.7 0.0 ; --; efp h2o -4.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0; }; ; set basis 6-31g; energy('scf').

However,; the |PSIfour| ecosystem provides a path for easier and more rapid development; of new features. The earliest versions of |PSIfour| were written by merging; individual executables that performed specific tasks into a unified C++; executable. By linking this C++ executable against the Python interpreter, the; individual modules could be called in any sequence, enabling a very diverse; range of tasks to be accomplished within a given input. Although Python-driven; model allowed for great flexibility from a user's perspective, programming was; still relatively difficult because it required modifications to be made in C++; code. Since those early days, the code has undergone some important structural; changes that have greatly simplified the development workflow. These changes; were motivated by the realization that only a few bottlenecks exist in a typical; calculation; by focusing on optimized C++ implementations of these bottlenecks; and making these C++ functions available in Python, most of the code to implement; the overall calculation can be written in simpler Python code.

Before the library may be used, it must first be initialized; via the dpd_init() function. This function; requires the following information (see dpd.h for proper syntax):; int dpd_init(int dpd_num, int nirreps, long int memory, int cachetype, ; int *cachefiles, int **cachelist, struct dpd_file4_cache_entry *priority, ; int num_subspaces, int *orbspi, int *orbsym, ...);. dpd_num - An integer identifier for the current DPD; setup. Only two active DPD's are currently allowed, so this value; can be either 0 or 1.; nirreps - The number of irreducible representations in; the point group.; memory - The amount of available memory in bytes.; cachetype - The type of file cacheing desired (see below). If this; is 0, then a priority-based cache is used; if it's 1 then a; ""least-recently-used"" method is applied.; cachefiles - See below.; cachelist - See below.; priority - See below.; num_subspaces - The number of orbital subspaces to be; used. If the programmer uses only occupied and virtual spaces,; for example, this would be set to 2.; For each value of num_subspaces, the following; two arrays must also be provided:; orbspi - An irrep population array,; i.e., the number of orbitals per irrep in the current; subspace.; orbsym - An orbital symmetry array,; i.e., the irrep value for each orbital in the current; subspace. For four-index quantities, the dpd_init() function; pre-computes a number of orbital lookup arrays about all pairwise; combinations of the given orbital subspaces, including information; regarding possible permutational symmetry or antisymmetry among the; orbitals. libdpd then assigns a particular ""pair number"" to; each possible combination of indices from the orbital subspace data; provided to dpd_init().

Performance," two neutral, spin-singlet fragments. It is; possible to further specify that the overall complex is neutral and spin-singlet; by inserting another :samp:`{charge} {multiplicity}` line, separated from the first; molecule block by a `--` line. If any information is missing, |PSIfour| will set the; unprovided charges and multiplicities to be consistent with those that are given.; For example, the overall charge must be simply the sum of all fragment charges.; |PSIfour| further assumes that any unpaired electrons are coupled to yield the highest; possible :math:`M_s` value. Psi will also favor neutral, spin-singlet fragments.; For anything complicated, we strongly suggest explicitly providing the charge; and multiplicity of each fragment as well as the total molecular charge and multiplicity. For details and examples, see https://github.com/MolSSI/QCElemental/blob/master/qcelemental/molparse/chgmult.py#L105-L136 . Having defined a molecule containing fragments like ``eneyne`` above, it; is a simple matter to perform calculations on only a subset of the; fragments. For instance, the commands below run a scf first on the ethene; fragment alone (``extract_subsets(1)`` pulls out fragment 1 as Real atoms; and discards remaining fragments) and next on the ethene fragment with the; ethyne fragment ghosted (``extract_subsets(1,2)`` pulls out fragment 1 as; Real atoms and sets fragment 2 as Ghost atoms). For beyond bimolecular; complexes, arrays can be used, e.g. ``extract_subsets(2,[1,3])``::. mA = eneyne.extract_subsets(1); energy('scf'); ; clean(); ; mAcp = eneyne.extract_subsets(1,2); energy('scf'). If the molecule contains fragments but is not conveniently ordered for the; ``--`` marker, the :py:func:`~psi4.driver.wrapper_autofrag.auto_fragments` function can be applied, as shown in; :srcsample:`pywrap-basis`, to return as active molecule the previous; active molecule, only fragmented.

Performance," uses two separate grids.; By default, the SCF algorithm is first converged on a smaller grid, followed by a; number of SCF iterations up to a maximum value (controlled by the |scf__cosx_maxiter_final| keyword); on a larger grid. By default, |scf__cosx_maxiter_final| is set to 1, a single; SCF iteration, which results in numerical errors comparable to; performing the entire SCF on the expensive larger grid at a computational cost; much closer to the smaller grid. Setting |scf__cosx_maxiter_final| to 0 disables the; larger grid entirely. Setting |scf__cosx_maxiter_final| to -1 allows; for the SCF to fully converge on the larger grid, useful for the study of wavefunction; properties such as gradients. The size of the initial grid is controlled by the keywords; |scf__cosx_radial_points_initial| and |scf__cosx_spherical_points_initial|.; The final grid is controlled by |scf__cosx_radial_points_final| and; |scf__cosx_spherical_points_final|. Currently, the default grids are very crude,; allowing for high performance at the cost of accuracy. If high-accuracy calculations; are desired with COSX, the grid sizes should be increased. Screening thresholds over integrals, densities, and basis extents are set; with the |scf__cosx_ints_tolerance|, |scf__cosx_density_tolerance|, and; |scf__cosx_basis_tolerance| keywords, respectively. |scf__cosx_ints_tolerance|; is the most consequential of the three thresholds in both cost and accuracy.; This keyword determines screening of negligible one-electron integrals.; |scf__cosx_density_tolerance| controls the threshold for significant; shell pairs in the density matrix. Lastly, |scf__cosx_basis_tolerance| is; a cutoff for the value of basis functions at grid points.

The last three examples provide a more convenient way for specifying; multiple keywords::. set {; basis = cc-pVDZ; print = 1; reference = rhf; }. For arguments that require an array input, standard Python list syntax should; be used, *viz.*::. set {; docc = [3, 0, 1, 1]; }. List/matrix inputs may span multiple lines, as long as the opening ``[`` is; on the same line as the name of the keyword. Any of the above keyword specifications can be scoped to individual modules,; by adding the name of the module after the ``set`` keyword. Omitting the module; name, or using the name ``global`` or ``globals`` will result in the keyword being; applied to all modules. For example, in the following input ::. molecule{; o; h 1 roh; h 1 roh 2 ahoh; ; roh = 0.957; ahoh = 104.5; }; ; set basis cc-pVDZ; set ccenergy print 3; set scf print 1; energy('ccsd'). the basis set is set to cc-pVDZ throughout, the SCF code will have a print; level of 1 and the ccenergy code, which performs coupled cluster computations,; will use a print level of 3. In this example a full CCSD computation is; performed by running the SCF code first, then the coupled cluster modules;; the :py:func:`~psi4.driver.energy` Python helper function ensures that this is performed correctly.; Note that the Python interpreter executes commands in the order they appear in; the input file, so if the last four commands in the above example were to read ::. set basis cc-pVDZ; energy('ccsd'); set ccenergy print 3; set scf print 1. the commands that set the print level would be ineffective, as they would be; processed after the CCSD computation completes.

Both ROHF and ; DFT orbitals may provide better initial guesses than UHF orbitals, hence convergence may be significantly speeded up with ROHF or DFT orbitals. ; In order to use ROHF orbitals, simply ``set reference rohf``.

Performance,", gaining the benefits of DF methods without suffering the; I/O bottlenecks that conventional DF methods will eventually run into. One such approach, outlined by Weigend in [Weigend:2002:4285]_,; is available for use in Psi4 for the separate construction of the Coulomb contribution to the Fock matrix. This implementation can be used alongside ; Psi4's separate Exchange construction algorithms for composite Fock matrix construction by using the keyword DFDIRJ as the Coulomb construction ; algorithm when specifying |globals__scf_type| to use a composite algorithm combination (``DFDIRJ+K_alg`` in general, ; or ``DFDIRJ`` for DFT with non-hybrid functionals). . DFDIRJ supports multiple capabilities to improve performance. Specifically, DFDIRJ allows for a combination of density-matrix based ERI ; screening (set |globals__screening| to ``DENSITY``) and incremental Fock matrix construction (set |scf__incfock| to ``TRUE``). These two, when combined,; enable more aggressive screening of ERI contributions to the Coulomb matrix and thus greatly improve performance. .. _`sec:scfcosx`:. COSX Exchange; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~.

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, it's important to keep in mind that; the values of the vibrational frequencies are a function of the molecular; geometry.

We could set up a second input file to perform; the vibrational frequency analysis, being very careful to copy over the; optimized geometry from the *bottom* of the output file for the geometry; optimization. This geometry could be specified in either z-matrix or; Cartesian formats. However, there's a much easier way to do this.

From 1978-1987, the package was; know as the {\tt BERKELEY} suite, and after the Schaefer group moved to the; Center for Computational Quantum Chemistry at the University of Georgia,; the package was renamed {\tt PSI}. Thanks primarily to the efforts of Curt; Janssen (Sandia Labs, Livermore) and Ed Seidl (LLNL), the package was; ported to UNIX systems, and substantially improved with new input formats; and a C-based I/O system.

As a result of this; effort, all of the legacy Fortran code was removed, and everything was; rewritten in C and C++, including new integral/derivative integral,; coupled cluster, and CI codes. In addition, new I/O libraries have; been added, as well as an improved checkpoint file structure and greater; automation of typical tasks such as geometry optimization and frequency; analysis. The package has the capability to determine wavefunctions,; energies, analytic gradients, and various molecular properties based on; a variety of theories, including spin-restricted, spin-unrestricted, and; restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (RHF, UHF, and ROHF); configuration; interaction (CI) (including a variety of multireference CI's and full; CI); coupled-cluster (CC) including CC with variationaly optimized; orbitals; second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MPPT); including explicitly correlated second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset energy; (MP2-R12); and complete-active-space self-consistent field (CASSCF); theory.

[Houck:2019:2278]_. ; This approach handles systems with both spin and spatial degeneracies ; by combining the spin-flip (SF) [Krylov:2001:522]_; and ionization potential/electron affinity (IP/EA) [Nooijen:1995:3629]_ ; approaches. . The Psi4FockCI plugin allows one to perform spin-flip (SF), ionization ; potential (IP), and electron affinity (EA) calculations, as well as ; combined RAS-SF-IP/EA calculations, through the DETCI (:ref:`sec:ci`) module. Installation; ~~~~~~~~~~~~. * Download the plugin from the GitHub repository:. .. code-block:: bash. >>> git clone https://github.com/shannonhouck/psi4fockci.git. * Once downloaded, the plugin can be installed as follows:. .. code-block:: bash. >>> cd {top-level-psi4fockci-directory}; >>> python -m pip install . Sample Input; ~~~~~~~~~~~~. To run a CAS-nSF-IP/EA calculation, start with a molecule with the ; correct charge and multiplicity for the reference state (i.e. some ; state well-represented by a single reference). Then, run an energy ; calculation, passing in the charge and multiplicity of the ; desired state; the number of spin-flips and IP/EA will be automatically ; determined based on this input. If additional excitations outside of the ; RAS II space are desired, one can set the level of external ; excitations using the ``conf_space`` keyword.

Performance,". In rare cases, the; DIIS algorithm may need to be modified or turned off altogether, which may be; accomplished via :term:`options <DIIS (SCF)>`.; ADIIS [On by Default]; ADIIS uses previous iterates of the Fock and density matrices to produce an; informed estimate of the next Fock matrix. ADIIS estimates are based on minimizing; an energy estimate rather than zeroing the residual, so this performs best in the early; iterations. By default, Psi will start using ADIIS before blending the ADIIS step with; the DIIS step, eventually using the pure DIIS step. The closely-related EDIIS procedure; may be used instead by setting |scf__scf_initial_accelerator|. This is formally identical; to ADIIS for HF, but the methods will differ for more general DFT.; MOM [Off by Default]; MOM was developed to combat a particular class of convergence failure:; occupation flipping. In some cases, midway though the SCF procedure, a partially; converged orbital which should be occupied in the fully-optimized SCF solution; has a slightly higher orbital eigenvalue than some other orbital which should be; destined to be a virtual orbital. This results in the virtual orbital being; spuriously occupied for one or more iterations. Sometimes this resolves itself; without help, other times the occupation flips back and forth between two, four,; or more orbitals. This is typically visible in the output as a non-converging; SCF which eventually settles down to steady oscillation between two (or more); different total energies. This behavior can be ameliorated by choosing occupied; orbitals by ""shape"" instead of by orbital eigenvalue, *i.e.*, by choosing the set; of new orbitals which looks most like some previously known ""good"" set. The; ""good"" set is typically the occupied orbitals from one of the oscillating; iterations with the lowest total energy. For an oscillating system where the; lowest total energy occurs on iterations :math:`N,N+2,\ldots`, invoking; |scf__mom_start| ``N`` can often rescue t",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/scf.rst:25349,optimiz,optimized,25349,doc/sphinxman/source/scf.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/scf.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimized']

Herbst; .. sectionauthor:: Michael F. Herbst. For most implemented ADC methods |PSIfour| relies; on an interface to the `adcc <https://adc-connect.org>`_ python package.; The approach of adcc is to directly diagonalise the; ADC matrix :math:`\mathbf{A}` in an iterative diagonalisation; procedure, usually a Jacobi-preconditioned Davidson. Expensive parts; of the ADC matrix-vector product are precomputed and stored; in memory. This approach is general in the sense; that it can be applied to a large range of ADC methods and variants.; So far levels up to ADC(3) and CVS-ADC(3) are available; and additional approximations such as; |globals__freeze_core| and |globals__num_frozen_uocc|; are supported with all ADC methods using the adcc backend. Currently adcc is only capable of performing in-core calculations,; for which, however, permutational symmetry and spin symmetry is taken; into account for both tensor computations and tensor storage.; Inside adcc some heuristic checks for overly excessive memory requirements; are implemented, resulting in a warning in case a; successful execution is unlikely. There are no guarantees for the memory; to be sufficient in case such a warning is not displayed. More detailed documentation about adcc and its features can be found; at `<https://adc-connect.org>`_,; especially the `theory section <https://adc-connect.org/latest/theory.html>`_.; If you are using adcc from |PSIfour| for your calculations,; please cite both |PSIfour| as well as adcc [Herbst2020]_; in your published work. **The ADC wavefunction object.**; After running the ADC calculation in adcc, the interface code sets; a number of variables in the returned :py:class:`~psi4.core.Wavefunction`; in case they are computed.; In the following the ``<method>`` prefix refers to the ADC method (such as ``adc(1)``,; ``adc(3)``, ``cvs-a",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/adc.rst:11022,perform,performing,11022,doc/sphinxman/source/adc.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/adc.rst,1,['perform'],['performing']

To get harmonic vibrational frequencies, it's important to keep in mind that; the values of the vibrational frequencies are a function of the molecular; geometry. Therefore, *it's important to obtain the vibrational frequencies ; at the OPTIMIZED GEOMETRY*. We could set up a second input file to perform; the vibrational frequency analysis, being very careful to copy over the; optimized geometry from the *bottom* of the output file for the geometry; optimization. This geometry could be specified in either z-matrix or; Cartesian formats. However, there's a much easier way to do this. If we; specify a vibrational frequency analysis in the same input file as the; optimization, after the optimization function has been called, then the; optimized geometry will automatically be carried over. So, it's easiset to do the optimization and vibrational frequency analysis; together. This can be specified as follows (see test case; :srcsample:`tu4-h2o-freq`):. .. literalinclude:: @SFNX_INCLUDE@samples/tu4-h2o-freq/input.dat. The program will do the same optimization as in our previous example,; but then it will follow it with some computations to obtain the Hessian; (second derivative matrix) of the electronic energy with respect to; nuclear displacements. From this, it can obtain the harmonic vibrational; frequencies, given below (roundoff errors of around 0.1 cm\ :sup:`-1`; may exist)::.

Performance,"074107]_. A companion perturbation; method (Mk-MRPT2) has been developed based on the Mukherjee formalisim; as shown in [Evangelista:2009:4728]_. The current version of the code is limited to reference active spaces; in which all determinants are connected to each other by no more than two; excitations. In practice, this usually means that the active space can have; at most two particles, or at most two holes. Examples would include ; CAS(2,2), CAS(2,8), CAS(4,3), etc., where CAS(n,m) refers to a; complete-active-space configuration interaction (CASCI) reference with n; electrons in m orbitals. If the user specifies active spaces that do not fit; these limitations, then the code will still run, but some relevant; determinants will be missing, and the answer obtained will be an approximation; to the true Mk-MRCC procedure. The PSIMRCC code itself does not perform orbital optimization. Hence, the; references used might be considered CASCI references, but not CASSCF; references (CASSCF implies that the orbitals have been optimized specifically; to minimize the energy of the CASCI reference). However, if one wishes to; use two-configuration self-consistent-field (TCSCF) orbitals, those can; be obtained using the multi-configuration self-consistent-field (MCSCF); component of PSIMRCC (specifying |mcscf__reference| to be ``twocon``).; This is suitable for describing diradicals. Otherwise, one may use RHF or; ROHF orbitals as input to PSIMRCC. Due to a current limitation in the code,; one must obtain orbitals using PSIMRCC's MCSCF module regardless of what; orbital type is chosen, ``twocon``, ``rhf``, or ``rohf``. An example of the; MCSCF input is given below. PSIMRCC is most commonly used for low-spin cases (singlets or open-shell; singlets). It is capable of performing computations on higher spin states; (*e.g.*, triplets), but in general, not all the required matrix elements have; been coded for high-spin cases, meaning that results will correspond to an; approximate Mk-",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/psimrcc.rst:4447,optimiz,optimized,4447,doc/sphinxman/source/psimrcc.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/psimrcc.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimized']

Performance,"1]_. Since we're using density fitting for the SAPT,; we might as well also use it for the Hartree--Fock computations that are; performed as part of the SAPT. We can specify that with ; ``scf_type DF``. Density fitting procedures require the use of auxiliary basis sets that; pair with the primary basis set. Fortunately, |PSIfour| is usually smart; enough to figure out what auxiliary basis sets are needed for a given; computation. In this case, jun-cc-pVDZ is a standard enough basis set; (just a simple truncation of the very popular aug-cc-pVDZ basis set); that |PSIfour| correctly guesses that we want the jun-cc-pVDZ-JKFIT; auxiliary basis for the Hartree--Fock, and the jun-cc-pVDZ-RI basis set; for the SAPT procedure. To speed up the computation a little, we also tell the SAPT procedure to; freeze the core electrons with ``freeze_core True``. The SAPT; procedure is invoked with the simple call, ``energy('sapt0')``. This; call knows to automatically run two monomer computations and a dimer; computation and then use these results to perform the SAPT analysis.

They further ; discussed that the orbital response equations generally have a singularity problem at the unrestriction point ; where spin-restricted orbitals become unstable to unrestriction. This singularity yields to extremely large or ; small eigenvalues of the one-particle density matrix (OPDM). These abnormal eigenvalues may lead to unphysical ; molecular properties such as vibrational frequencies. However, orbital-optimized MP2 (also MP3); will solve this N-representability problem by disregarding orbital response contribution of one-particle; density matrix. .

The FISAPT module provides two extensions to standard SAPT theory to allow for; (1) an effective two-body partition of the various SAPT terms to localized; chemical functional groups (F-SAPT) and (2) a means to compute the SAPT; interaction between two moieties within the embedding field of a third body; (I-SAPT). F-SAPT is designed to provide additional insight into the chemical; origins of a noncovalent interaction, while I-SAPT allows for one to perform; a SAPT analysis for intramolecular interactions. F-SAPT and I-SAPT can be; deployed together in this module, yielding ""F/I-SAPT."" All F/I-SAPT computations; in |PSIfour| use density-fitted SAPT0 as the underlying SAPT methodology. Interested; users should consult the manual page for Ed Hohenstein's :ref:`SAPT0 <sec:sapt>` code; and the SAPT literature to understand the specifics of SAPT0 before beginning; with F/I-SAPT0.

Introduction; ~~~~~~~~~~~~. Orbital-optimized methods have several advantages over their non-optimized counterparts. ; Once the orbitals are optimized, the wave function will obey the Hellmann--Feynman theorem; for orbital rotation parameters. Therefore, there is no need for orbital response terms ; in the evaluation of analytic gradients. In other words, it is unnecessary to solve the ; first order coupled-perturbed CC and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) equations. ; Further, computation of one-electron properties is easier because there are no response contributions to the particle ; density matrices (PDMs). Moreover, active space approximations can be readily incorporated into the CC methods ; [Krylov:2000:vod]_. Additionally, orbital-optimized coupled-cluster avoids spurious second-order ; poles in its response function, and its transition dipole moments are gauge invariant [Pedersen:1999:od]_. Another advantage is that the orbital-optimized methods do not suffer from artifactual symmetry-breaking ; instabilities [Crawford:1997:instability]_, [Sherrill:1998:od]_, [Bozkaya:2011:omp2]_, and [Bozkaya:2011:omp3]_.; Furthermore, Kurlancheek and Head-Gordon [Kurlancek:2009]_ demonstrated that first order properties such as ; forces or dipole moments are discontinuous along nuclear coordinates when such a symmetry breaking occurs. ; They also observed that although the energy appears well behaved, the MP2 method can have natural occupation ; numbers greater than 2 or less than 0, hence may violate the N-representability condition. They further ; discussed that the orbital response equations generally have a singularity problem at the unrestriction point ; where spin-restricted orbitals become unstable to unrestriction. This singularity yields to extremely large or ; small eigenvalues of the",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/occ.rst:2588,optimiz,optimized,2588,doc/sphinxman/source/occ.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/occ.rst,1,['optimiz'],['optimized']

David Sherrill. *Module:* :ref:`Keywords <apdx:detci>`, :ref:`PSI Variables <apdx:detci_psivar>`, :source:`DETCI <psi4/src/psi4/detci>`. As the cost of Full CI scales exponentially with respect to the number of; active orbitals it is often advantageous to neglect orbitals that do not; exhibit strong correlation. These orbitals are variationally optimized; simultaneously with the CI coefficients and known as Multi-Configurational; Self-Consistent Field (MCSCF). The most commonly used MCSCF procedure is the; complete-active-space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) approach [Roos:1980]_,; which includes all possible determinants (with the proper symmetry) that can be; formed by distributing a set of active electrons among a set of active; orbitals. The MCSCF module performs CASSCF optimization of molecular orbitals; via a two-step procedure in which the CI coefficients and orbitals are; optimized in an alternating manner. The program uses a fairly simple; approximate orbital Hessian [Chaban:1997:88]_ and a Newton-Raphson update,; accelerated by Pulay's DIIS procedure [Pulay:1980]_. We have also implemented; the RASSCF method [Malmqvist:1990:RASSCF]_, which is another kind of MCSCF; which is typically less complete (and less expensive) than CASSCF. Inactive orbitals in the MCSCF may be specified by the; |globals__restricted_docc| and |globals__restricted_uocc| keywords. These; orbitals will remain doubly-occupied or doubly-unoccupied, respectively, in the; MCSCF wavefunction. However, the form of these orbitals will be optimized in; the MCSCF procedure. It is also possible to literally freeze inactive orbitals; in their original (SCF) form using the |globals__frozen_docc| and; |globals__frozen_uocc| keywords. This is not normally what one wishes to do in; an MCSCF computation (*e.g.*, it complicates the computation o",MatchSource.DOCS,psi4,psi4,v1.9.1,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/mcscf.rst:2196,perform,performs,2196,doc/sphinxman/source/mcscf.rst,https://psicode.org,https://github.com/psi4/psi4/tree/v1.9.1/doc/sphinxman/source/mcscf.rst,3,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimization', 'optimized', 'performs']"

If this is initially set to 1, then optking, as poor steps are detected,; will increase the dynamic level through several forms of more robust and cautious algorithms.; The changes will reduce the trust radius, allow backward steps (partial line; searching), add cartesian coordinates, switch to cartesian coordinates, and take; steepest-descent steps. * The developers have found the |optking__opt_coordinates| set to ""BOTH"" which; includes both the redundant internal coordinate set, as well as cartesian coordinates,; works well for systems with long 'arms' or floppy portions of a molecule poorly; described by local internals. * Optking does support the specification of ghost atoms.

In order for this to happen, the C++; binding must be known to Python; this is all done in the ; {\tt \$PSI4/src/bin/psi4/python.cc} file. For example, we have an SCF module, with; the C++ signature; {\tt PsiReturnType cscf::cscf(Options \&options);}; To allow Python to use this, we first define a little wrapper function; \begin{verbatim}; double py_psi_scf(); {; if (scf::scf(Process::environment.options) == Success); return Process::environment.globals[""CURRENT ENERGY""];; else; return 0.0;; }; \end{verbatim}; This does a couple of things to automate things a) it passes the default; options object into SCF automatically, so that the user doesn't have to, and b); checks the return value, and will return the energy, which is posted to the; globals map, back to Python.

The CISD wavefunction has fallen out of favor; because truncated CI wavefunctions are not size-extensive, meaning; that their quality degrades for larger molecules. MP2 is a less; expensive alternative giving results similar to those of CISD for small; molecules, but the quality of MP2 does not degrade for larger molecules.; Coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) is another size-extensive; alternative; it is only slightly more costly computationally than CISD,; but it typically provides significantly more accurate results. The CI code in |PSIfour| is described in detail in ; [Sherrill:1999:CI]_. For the reasons stated above, the CI code in; |PSIfour| is not optimized for CISD computations, and it uses data structures; that are particularly inefficient for CISD and may result in the program; running out of memory and crashing for CISD except on very small molecules.; Instead, DETCI was designed to be efficient; in handling more highly correlated CI wavefunctions that can be helpful in more ; challenging cases such as highly strained molecules or bond breaking reactions.

However, a more; physically-motivated and often more accurate approach is the idea of ""gap; fitting"" or ""optimal tuning"" or simply ""tuning."" The most popular tuned-LRC; approach is IP-fitting, in which the :math:`\omega` is varied until the; Koopman's IP (the opposite of the HOMO energy) matches the true IP (the; difference between :math:`N-1`\ -electron and :math:`N`\ -electron total; energies), within the LRC functional ansatz.

Performance,"ased. Although significantly cheaper than computing; integrals themselves, construction of integral objects can be non-negligible,; especially if many threads are used. For example, this pattern can be found in; old versions of the code:. .. code-block:: cpp. std::vector<std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>> ints;; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(factory->eri()));; for (int thread = 1; thread < num_threads; thread++) {; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(factory->eri()));; }. This builds many objects and the cost can add up. With the new scheme,; integral objects are forced to implement a `clone()` member that can be used as; follows:. .. code-block:: cpp. std::vector<std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>> ints;; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(factory->eri()));; for (int thread = 1; thread < num_threads; thread++) {; ints.push_back(std::shared_ptr<TwoBodyAOInt>(ints[0]->clone()));; }. This method only incurs the cost of creating a single integral object, and; performs much cheaper cloning operations to create the other objects for each; thread. Moreover, if integral objects are created only in the initialization; of each code that uses them, and stored persistently, the cost of integral; object creation is further reduced.

It can solve for restricted active space; configuration interaction (RAS CI) wavefunctions as described by Olsen,; Roos, Jorgensen, and Aa. Jensen [Olsen:1988]_. Excitation-class; selected multi-reference CI wavefunctions, such as second-order CI,; can be formulated as RAS CI's. A RAS CI selects determinants for the; model space as those which have no more than :math:`n` holes in the lowest set; of orbitals (called RAS I) and no more than :math:`m` electrons in the highest; set of orbitals (called RAS III). An intermediate set of orbitals, if; present (RAS II), has no restrictions placed upon it. All determinants; satisfying these rules are included in the RAS CI. The DETCI module is also very efficient at computing full configuration; interaction; wavefunctions, and it is used in this capacity in the complete-active-space; self-consistent-field (CASSCF) code. It can also perform approximate; CASSCF computations in which one uses RAS restrictions on the CI excitations,; rather than doing a full CI in the active space. This is called a ; RASSCF. CASSCF and RASSCF computations are types of multi-configurational; self-consistent-field procedures, and are described in :ref:`sec:mcscf`. As mentioned above, the DETCI module is designed for challenging; chemical systems for which simple CISD is not suitable. Because; CI wavefunctions which go beyond CISD (such as RAS CI) are fairly complex,; typically the DETCI code will be used in cases where the; tradeoffs between computational expense and completeness of the; model space are nontrivial. Hence, the user is advised to develop; a good working knowledge of multi-reference and RAS CI methods before; attempting to use the program for a production-level project.

Performance,"can be; set in a globals section like this. If an option needs to be visible; only to one part of the program (*e.g.*, we only want to increase the; energy convergence in the SCF code, but not the rest of the; code), it can be placed in a section of input visible to that part of the; program (*e.g.*, ``set scf e_convergence 1.0E-8``). Back to our SAPT example, we have found that for basic-level SAPT; computations (*i.e.*, SAPT0), a good error cancellation is found; [Hohenstein:2012:WIREs]_ with the jun-cc-pVDZ basis (this is the; usual aug-cc-pVDZ basis, but without diffuse functions on hydrogen and; without diffuse :math:`d` functions on heavy atoms) [Papajak:2011:10]_. So,; we'll use that as our standard basis set. The SAPT code is designed to; use density fitting techniques, because they introduce minimal errors; while providing much faster computations [Hohenstein:2010:184111]_ ; [Hohenstein:2010:014101]_. Since we're using density fitting for the SAPT,; we might as well also use it for the Hartree--Fock computations that are; performed as part of the SAPT. We can specify that with ; ``scf_type DF``. Density fitting procedures require the use of auxiliary basis sets that; pair with the primary basis set. Fortunately, |PSIfour| is usually smart; enough to figure out what auxiliary basis sets are needed for a given; computation. In this case, jun-cc-pVDZ is a standard enough basis set; (just a simple truncation of the very popular aug-cc-pVDZ basis set); that |PSIfour| correctly guesses that we want the jun-cc-pVDZ-JKFIT; auxiliary basis for the Hartree--Fock, and the jun-cc-pVDZ-RI basis set; for the SAPT procedure. To speed up the computation a little, we also tell the SAPT procedure to; freeze the core electrons with ``freeze_core True``. The SAPT; procedure is invoked with the simple call, ``energy('sapt0')``. This; call knows to automatically run two monomer computations and a dimer; computation and then use these results to perform the SAPT analysis.
