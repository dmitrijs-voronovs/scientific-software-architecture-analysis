Can we avoid heavily (or even moderately) templated code? I'm already nervous long-term about the latency of the C++ compiler overhead and if I'm being honest would prefer to generate LLVM IR directly into memory. We should ship whatever compiler is best on the cloud and in the download package. That already covers a vast majority of our users. If clang is the clear winner, we can make that clear in the documentation and maybe warn about gcc it on startup. > But that becomes a problem in itself if we want the shipped compiler to work on a variety of OS'es.

Availability," for example, a compromised `notebook` from masquerading as `batch`. I agree that additionally verifying that the certificate came from a single root certificate (that we, perhaps, destroy after everything is signed) would additionally prevent a malicious user from inserting their certificates into the trusted certificates list. AFAICT, python's `ssl` module has no support for this verification strategy. We could probably build an SSLContext shim that contained two SSLContexts one with a root cert and one with the trusted certs and require certification verification to pass both. Seems easy to get wrong, so I'm inclined to not take this path. ### trusted cert lists. Yeah, it felt a little silly to duplicate the cert in each secret. However, this seems like the simplest approach if I require each principal to only trust a subset of incoming/outgoing principals. If I had one secret per principal, then I have to modify build.yaml or deployment.yamls if I modify the trust sets. That seemed error prone. If I had one secret with all the certs, then when a service starts up it has to select the trusted ones and only insert those into its certificate store. This seems OK, but a little harder to inspect. Duplicating a cert for each trust list to which it belongs occupies what seems like a good spot to me from a developer ergonomics perspective:; - O(trusts) modifications necessary to update/revoke the cert; - O(1) configuration to load a trust list; - no pod-start-time configuration; - the trust list is on the container's file system, so its easy to inspect. Small point: I don't pin the incoming certs yet due to the mTLS challenges. ### create on each deploy. Only creating certs if they don't exist is an easy change. Seems fine, though leaves unresolved how to rotate the certs. I guess I'm inclined to always recreate because it makes rotation the common case, forcing us to make it work well. I think the only way to do a no-downtime rotation is:; 1. create fresh certs; 2. crea",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8561#issuecomment-617428243:1894,error,error,1894,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8561#issuecomment-617428243,1,['error'],['error']

Availability," recipe continues but it is also passed literally to the shell*. The docs page you linked directly addresses our use case and suggests we put the command inside of a make variable (thus triggering normal backslash-newline rules rather than the special recipe line rules). > Sometimes you want to split a long line inside of single quotes, but you donâ€™t want the backslash/newline to appear in the quoted content. This is often the case when passing scripts to languages such as Perl, where extraneous backslashes inside the script can change its meaning or even be a syntax error. One simple way of handling this is to place the quoted string, or even the entire command, into a make variable then use the variable in the recipe. In this situation the newline quoting rules for makefiles will be used, and the backslash/newline will be removed. If we rewrite our example above using this method:; > ; > ```; > HELLO = 'hello \; > world'; > ; > all : ; @echo $(HELLO); > ```; > ; > we will get output like this:; > ; > ```; > hello world; > ```; >; > If you like, you can also use target-specific variables (see [Target-specific Variable Values](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Target_002dspecific.html)) to obtain a tighter correspondence between the variable and the recipe that uses it. It seems to me like there are not any great choices. Putting the JSON into a Make variable seems too magical and likely to confuse a newbie editing this file.

Notice:; 1. The total memory available on the machine is less than 52 GiB (= 53,248 MiB), indeed it is a full 1025 MiB below the advertised amount.; 2. Once all the components of the Dataproc cluster have started (but before any Hail Query jobs are submitted) the total memory available is already depleted to 42760 MiB. Recall that Hail allocates 41 GiB (= 41,984 MiB) to its JVM. This leaves the Python process and all other daemons on the system only 776 MiB of excess RAM. For reference `python3 -c 'import hail'` needs 206 MiB. ---. We must address this situation. It seems safe to assume that the system daemons will use a constant 9.5 GiB of RAM. Moreover the advertised RAM amount is at least 1 GiB larger than reality. I propose:; 1. The driver memory calculation in `hailctl dataproc` should take the advertised RAM amount, subtract 10.5 GiB, and then use 90% of the remaining value.

Availability,"-beta, --configuration=, --dry-run, --project= and --zone=. These apply to all commands. There is a GcloudRunner object that takes these options, is set to the click context user obj field, and is used by all hailctl dataproc commands to invoke gcloud. Note, not all dataproc subcommands invoke gcloud, but the current design doesn't differentiate. Note, with click, the subcommand options must go on the subcommand, so hailctl dataproc stop --dry-run is an error. Nice. It's great that these are handled at the `hailctl dataproc` level instead of having to remember to account for them in every `hailctl dataproc` subcommand. That's going to resolve a lot of inconsistencies (like #9587). A nitpick though... is there a better name for the click context attribute than ""obj""?. > hailctl no longer takes --region (for gcloud dataproc commands). I compute region in GcloudRunner by checking dataproc/region or falling back to determining the region from the zone. I error if the region and zone are incompatible (gcloud would also do this). If consistency with `gcloud dataproc` is desired, I think the opposite (determining zone from cluster region) would be preferable. `gcloud dataproc` commands take a `--region` argument. [`--zone` is an optional argument for `gcloud dataproc clusters create`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/dataproc/clusters/create#--zone). When a cluster's zone is needed to run `gcloud compute` commands, it can be determined using `gcloud dataproc clusters describe <cluster> --format json`. `hailctl dataproc diagnose` currently does this. I believe the only reason that we currently require a zone be provided either in gcloud configuration or on the command line is to maintain backwards compatibility. `cloudtools` and earlier versions of `hailctl` had a default value for the `--zone` option of `hailctl dataproc start` (I think it was `us-central1-b`). > I stripped all gcloud pass through args from hailctl dataproc modify.

Availability,"00 on error. We could return a BadRequest error code with the message 'invalid spec' and then handle the MJC database call on the driver. I chose instead to have the worker to post job complete so we get the error message with the stack trace showing up in the UI as having the normal job flow seemed cleaner to me last week then special casing `schedule_job` on the driver. `post job complete` needs a job object to get the status to send back to the driver. However, a `Job` has two concrete implementations and we don't know which the bad job is because we can't get the spec. Furthermore, the `Job` class does a lot of work based on the spec right now. So I thought it was clearer to just create a new class that had the status, but nothing else. After writing this out, it's probably better to have the driver MJC upon error rather than from the worker. The code below would be more complicated. We'd have to get the traceback / error message from the response from the worker. ```python3; try:; await client_session.post(; f'http://{instance.ip_address}:5000/api/v1alpha/batches/jobs/create',; json=body,; timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=2),; ); await instance.mark_healthy(); except aiohttp.ClientResponseError as e:; await instance.mark_healthy(); if e.status == 403:; log.info(f'attempt already exists for job {id} on {instance}, aborting'); if e.status == 503:; log.info(f'job {id} cannot be scheduled because {instance} is shutting down, aborting'); raise e; except Exception:; await instance.incr_failed_request_count(); raise; ```. And the error handling would look something like this:. ```python3; try:; body = await job_config(app, record, attempt_id); except Exception:; log.exception('while making job config'); status = {; 'version': STATUS_FORMAT_VERSION,; 'worker': None,; 'batch_id': batch_id,; 'job_id': job_id,; 'attempt_id': attempt_id,; 'user': record['user'],; 'state': 'error',; 'error': traceback.format_exc(),; 'container_statuses': {k: None for k in tasks},; }. ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11391#issuecomment-1048213078:1491,down,down,1491,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11391#issuecomment-1048213078,4,"['down', 'error']","['down', 'error']"
Availability,"1. For runImage steps, you can only copy out-of or copy into `/io` (the reasoning is a bit complicated and somewhat historical).; 2. For buildImage steps, you can copy out-of or copy into `/`; 3. the `to` of an `output` specifies a file path in a ""filesystem"" that another step can access if it `dependsOn` the outputting step; 4. the `from` of an `input` specifies a file path in the aforementioned ""filesystem""; the filesystem contains all `outputs` from steps in the inputting step's `dependsOn` clause. We also have a `docker/Makefile` which is an emergency manual build system. I update that so that `hail_version` appears in the root of the docker context. The `service-base` uses the entire repository as its docker context, so I place hail_version at the root of the repository. I moved the `version` function from `hailtop.hailctl` into `hailtop`. It seems broadly useful and isn't specific to hailctl in anyway. Your concern about loading from pkg_resources repeated seems well-founded, so I went ahead and loaded the hail_version at package import time. This seems likely to ensure we learn about a missing hail_version file as early as possible (presumably at service start-time). This also means all hailtop installs need a hail_version file. I only found two other places that use hailtop. One of them was a completely unused Dockerfile. I deleted that (`Dockerfile.hailtop`). The other was Dockerfile.ci-test, which I updated to copy the hail_version file just like service-base. https://github.com/hail-is/hail/compare/main...danking:add-version-endpoint. Do you want to cherry-pick that change onto your add-version-endpoint branch?. One more change request: can we remove the try-catch? I don't expect any errors in that call and I tend to avoid revealing anything about errors to our users. Aiohttp will log the error and the stack trace if you let it rise all the way.

Availability,"1. Functionally, it's already possible -- should be able to do `vds.annotate_variants_db('va.dann')` and get the `va.dann.score` annotation in your VDS. Taking a step further, you can even do `vds.annotate_variants_db('va')` and get all of the annotations. It's just a matter of designing the query builder to encourage people using the function in whatever way we think is optimal, I suppose. What are the downsides to carrying around a lot of annotations in a VDS? I worry that if we supplied a select-all `va` option, everybody would just use that -- but if there aren't any major drawbacks, maybe that's the way to go and we don't even really need a query builder. Or maybe just allowing top-level selections like `va.dann`, `va.chromHMM`, etc. would be a good intermediate solution. 2. Yes! I'd definitely be interested in working on a Scala implementation, if one of you would be willing to work with a newbie :). Though I think if we can get this Python version working & usable first, that may be best. 3. I'll look into this. I don't have a solution yet. That's why in the method documentation, I used ; `.. code-block:: python` statements to add example code snippets. With the `>>> ...` syntax, the build was trying to run those examples and throwing weird errors like you anticipated.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/1914#issuecomment-308780378:407,down,downsides,407,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/1914#issuecomment-308780378,2,"['down', 'error']","['downsides', 'errors']"
Availability,"1. I really don't understand what this code is trying to do. Can you give me a short explanation in English?. 2. I think you just need single-use Let forwarding to optimize this. It looks like:. Push down the TableCount. (TableCount (Paralellelize ...)) should turn into (ArrayLen (GetField rows ...)). Push the ArrayLen/GetField into the Let. (Is this what your ""MaximizeLets"" is doing? I think that would traditionally be called let lifting.). Now you have (Let __cols_and_globals (ArrayLen (GetField __cols (Ref __cols_and_globals))). Then you forward the single-use Let, and the rest of the code simplifies into (ArrayLen (TableCollect (TableRead ""cols""))), and that should have the static number of rows and be able to be simplified. 3. So how should single-use Let forwarding work? You need two things: to determine there is only one use, and that the single use isn't in a more expensive context, e.g. you don't want to forward a single-use Let into a loop: (Let expensive X (ArrayMap a x <use expensive once>)). Since our control flow is structured, there is a static notion of ""loop nesting depth"", e.g. in the above code, the Let has nesting depth 0, and the use in the ArrayMap body has nesting depth 1. You can only forward into the same nesting depth. 4. Final question is, do you want the let forwarding pass to also delete unused Lets? If you delete a let, that might delete references that make other lets single (or zero) use. In this case, it might be nice to build a ""use-def chain"" data structure, that keeps, for each let, its list of uses (and vice versa). Then, when you delete a Let, you can dynamically delete the references for the right hand side, possibly creating additional optimization opportunities.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5041#issuecomment-452863737:200,down,down,200,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5041#issuecomment-452863737,1,['down'],['down']

I feel like if we can force all batches down the new code path we'll be incentivized to make it really low overhead for batches that only submit jobs once, and that will benefit all batches, as well as simplifying the mental model.

Availability,"> Ah sorry, I forgot to update the original commit message as that's not actually correct. The optimization is that we don't need to iterate through all blobs until we find the exact blob matching our path name. The list operation returns all blobs that start with the prefix of that path. If we see a blob with a different name that is a child of our path f'{path}/foo, then we know it's a directory and don't need to iterate anymore (although it could be a file as well, but in Scala we don't currently throw errors on paths that are both files and directories, so we just choose the first we see). If we see a blob that matches the path exactly, then we know it's a file and stop iterating. The only reason we need to iterate through more than one blob is if there's blobs that are like '{path}zzzzz/foo or '{path}szzzzz. We need to ignore these as they don't provide any information on whether {path} is a file or directory. This is where isChildOf is needed because we need to make sure the blob is actually a child of the path such as '{path}/file and not {path}zzzzz/file. Ah thanks, this makes more sense to me now. > The other option is to do 2 queries. One to check if it's a file and the next to check if there are any child blobs.

Availability,"> I think pretty strongly that if nPreservedFields==0, you've done something very wrong. I don't disagree, but if you're concerned about this, I think an assert here is both in the wrong place and the wrong solution. I think for the design the IR, we should focus on (1) simple operations (this is already more complicated than I'd like), (2) that are composable, and (3) minimize special cases. By composability, I mean each IR should have a (local) contract, and each program composed from that local contract should be valid. Breaking this introduces a lot of potential bugs that can't be reasoned about locally, which is not good. The IR nodes do what they do. If you don't like what they do, we should probably find different ones. > so how could you possibly join this with another table? You'd have to create a single partition, and we'd never want to do that. Yeah, create a single partition. Or reshuffle if the partitioner has too little information. How much is too little? What if nPreservedFields==1 and we're down to 1 partition? Should that be an error? 2 partitions? How many partitions is too few? Any time nPreservedFields is less than the requested keys, you could get down to 1 partition. This is a continuous issue and rejecting the extreme case doesn't actually solve the problem. I guess isSorted isn't user exposed, but this seems dangerously close to reporting a user error with an assertion. When the service comes up, hopefully not too long, we're going to want to document the IR and make it public. So if we want to reject this case, we should do it early on: when the IR is parsed and/or constructed. (In general I think to give a nice experience we're going to have to do more up-front validation.) This is what I mean when I say ""find another IR"".

Availability,"> The hailctl dataproc subcommand now has --beta, --configuration=, --dry-run, --project= and --zone=. These apply to all commands. There is a GcloudRunner object that takes these options, is set to the click context user obj field, and is used by all hailctl dataproc commands to invoke gcloud. Note, not all dataproc subcommands invoke gcloud, but the current design doesn't differentiate. Note, with click, the subcommand options must go on the subcommand, so hailctl dataproc stop --dry-run is an error. Nice. It's great that these are handled at the `hailctl dataproc` level instead of having to remember to account for them in every `hailctl dataproc` subcommand. That's going to resolve a lot of inconsistencies (like #9587).

[`--zone` is an optional argument for `gcloud dataproc clusters create`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/dataproc/clusters/create#--zone). When a cluster's zone is needed to run `gcloud compute` commands, it can be determined using `gcloud dataproc clusters describe <cluster> --format json`. `hailctl dataproc diagnose` currently does this. I believe the only reason that we currently require a zone be provided either in gcloud configuration or on the command line is to maintain backwards compatibility. `cloudtools` and earlier versions of `hailctl` had a default value for the `--zone` option of `hailctl dataproc start` (I think it was `us-central1-b`). > I stripped all gcloud pass through args from hailctl dat",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9842#issuecomment-767168393:501,error,error,501,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9842#issuecomment-767168393,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"> The thinking behind this is that there's a huge amount of re-use of code for an individual from one Hail analysis to the next. So I'm not sure I buy this. Hail is a exploratory data analysis platform, it isn't a SQL engine running nightly billing reports. In particular, as we do whole stage optimization and code generation. It isn't clear to me how you do code-reuse when we're specializing each operation into the global context (happy to hear the plan). For example, tables that have many fields, you will need to load different ones for different queries and in general it is infeasible (exponential) to generate them all. Also, to get sharing you need to break the code up and now you're running the compiler multiple times which also seems bad. Given our focus on large-scale analysis, introducing optimization boundaries for code reuse seems like a bad trade off to me. A significant amount of analysis happens in the cloud where $HOME is ephemeral so you won't get savings between sessions. Finally, there are pipelines that are more standardized but it is my impression they are run on extremely large datasets (hours, overnight) in which case compilation speed isn't important. Finally, there's the complexity around locking that isn't easy and have real technical risk. A compiler cache potentially becomes more appealing in the context of an always-on service. There's no locking issue, and you can start to do things like speculative compilation (e.g. immediately start compiling the decoder (the full decoder? Hmm.) when a user opens the dataset.). I would say getting in a 3x decoder improvement is way more important than this. I would have punted it down the road and instrumented to estimate cache hit rates before building this out.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-410358596:1670,down,down,1670,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-410358596,1,['down'],['down']
Availability,"> Why is writing the hail table first more efficient than just directly exporting from the grouped matrixtable?. We take special care to ensure our system is as efficient as possible when reading or writing to this native format. So, it's partly a sociological thing. On the practical end of things, Hail's native formats (for Tables and Matrix Tables) are a partitioned binary format. The partitioned part means Hail can use many cores in parallel to process and write the dataset. The binary part means that Hail need not use unnecessarily large (in terms of bytes) representations of values. These three things together make writing the native formats use less time, use less memory, and be more reliable. ---. > One thing I noticed is the mt_hwe_vals variable in my code below is a MatrixTable and not a GroupedMatrixTable.

Availability,"> all options that are also gcloud options (such as --project)? [That] could be difficult. Yes, this is what I was thinking. `hailctl` could parse (as much as is needed) the `gcloud` options to find options (like `--project`) and modify others (like `--initialization-actions`). The latter is somewhat surprising since one expects everything after the `--` to pass through unchanged. OK, summarizing our options so far:. - hailctl has no options that are also gcloud options. gcloud options go after the `--`, and get modified as needed by hailctl (with a message).; - hailctl has no gcloud options that are simply pass through. gcloud options that are needed by hailctl commands are hailctl options (like `--project`). When a gcloud option is needed by some hailctl command, all hailctl commands take that option (when it makes sense), even if in some cases that makes them simply pass through. This fixes the inconsistency issues, but the user still needs to keep track of which gcloud options needs to be passed to hailctl and which are passed to gcloud directly. If you specify an option twice, once to hailctl and once to gcloud, we invoke gcloud with the option duplicated. Pros and cons:; - The first option has the most consistent interface.; - The first option modifies options after the --, which is surprising.; - The first option involves replication (some of) the gcloud option parsing semantics, which is annoying.; - The second option requires the user to know which gcloud options need to be passed to hailctl instead (but globally, not per-command).; - With the second option, if we want to warn (or error) on duplicate options, we're back to duplicating the gcloud option parsing logic.

Availability,"@cseed As I briefly mentioned in an email on Saturday, I moved notebook loading to a prefetched model. Data and page loading are decoupled: When one clicks on the Notebook link, routing to the page happens without waiting for data to come in from notebook-api.hail.is. If data is available, it is shown, else a loading indicator. To avoid loading screens, I call notebook-api.hail.is asynchronously immediately after a user hits app.hail.is, whether they're on the Notebook page or not. Therefore, typically a user will never see a Notebook page loading indicator, when they click from one page to Notebook (say they land on the home page: by the time they click on Notebook, the data is fetched, so no loading screen). Furthermore, web sockets keep that Notebook data up to date, again regardless of whether a user is on the Notebook page. So in all instances except when a user lands on Notebook directly, the time it takes to reach the Notebook page is << 16ms (seemingly ~3ms). A similar approach is now used for scorecard, except Scorecard will render data in the SSR phase (because I consider scorecard less important, and because most users of the web app won't need it), and will not prefetch data when on another page. However, clicking on ""Scorecard"" from another page will not cause routing to block while waiting for the https://scorecard.hail.is/json response; instead a loading indicator will be shown. In practice I find this preferable, because the GUI feels more responsive, and users get more feedback.

So, `gsutil` only supports `python2`, but it's happy to search through your path for a variety of binaries with suggestive names until it finds a valid python 2.x binary. `cloudtools` itself works with any version of python (there was a recent breaking change in the release of python 3.7, which broke cloud tools [but that's been resolved in an open PR](https://github.com/Nealelab/cloudtools/pull/91/files#diff-7decff7c08c5270a32982ea34483b8cbR11)). Now, wrt PYPI, @catoverdrive discovered that the version of python you use to run `setup.py bdist_wheel` determines which version of python is deployed. This is rather confusing and, since none (or many?) of us did not know this, we accidentally uploaded a variety of [cloud tools versions on pypi, as you've noted](https://pypi.org/simple/cloudtools/). There was some earlier confusion wherein I thought we should only support `python2`, but that was a mistake on my end. We should support both versions, and when the user tries to start a cluster, `gsutil` will provide an error message guiding them to install `python2`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4240#issuecomment-419912588:1625,error,error,1625,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4240#issuecomment-419912588,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"@jjfarrell Thanks for sharing that! This is really interesting information. I'm quite surprised, but the evidence is pointing to there being a PC that largely separates those 8 replicates from the entire remaining dataset (!!!). I'm personally quite surprised that 8 samples out of thousands could pull this off, but that definitely seems to be the issue, given that the PCs from PC-AiR avoid the issue. Thank you so much for hunting this down! It's very valuable information for us. ### Next Steps . So, clearly we need a solution for users that have substantial numbers of related individuals in their source dataset (especially if the pedigrees are unknown). For your _particular_ use case, I can add a blurb to the docs that recommends removing known replicates _before_ PCA and then projecting them using the loadings from PCA. A longer term solution is to simply implement PC-AiR in hail. I skimmed the implementation section of the paper earlier this week and it looks very straightforward. It seems to boil down to using the KING estimator to estimate relatedness, compute PCA on unrelated individuals, project related individuals into unrelated PC space. Finally, we can use pc_relate to improve on our original estimates of relatedness from KING. The timeline for the latter thing is kind of unclear and a bit further out given some other work I need to finish. I'll get the documentation improvement in this week.

I was a bit tired at the time and probably shouldn't have been responding to GitHub issues ðŸ˜…. Hail's version of pc-relate does not identify an initial set of related and unrelated individuals. The R `pcrelate` implementation (the official / reference implementation by the authors of the paper) does this to identify a set of individuals on which to run the principal components analysis. It is not entirely clear to me why this is necessary, and we don't currently have a mechanism for doing so (since pc_relate _is_ our mechanism for determining related and unrelated individuals when there is population structure in the data set). If you have prior knowledge about related samples, you might try filtering to an known unrelated set and computing the scores from that set. I'm curious if that makes any difference in the results. Your invocations look very reasonable. I'll get in touch with the gnomAD team here at the broad to learn more about their experiences with pc_relate and see if I can better understand what's happening with the replicate samples.

Availability,"Because that won't work at all, because the input file name expected by `gatk IndexFeatureFile` won't exist. But perhaps you meant to connect the unrelated filenames via something like. ```; â€¦; bgzip -c {j.tsv_counts} > {j.counts['tsv.gz']}; â€¦; ```. Reasons for not doing that would include:. 1. Filename extensions are significant to GATK, so I would not trust `SubCommand` to write the output file in the right format if the filename did not have the expected extension. (This could be ameliorated via `j.tsv_counts.set_extension`.). 2. Using bgzip with `-c â€¦ >` is not its natural mode of operation, so is more likely to encounter bugs than the more typical `bgzip filename` invocation. (For example, plain gzip burns the input filename into the compressed file's header, so the redirection version produces different results from the typical invocation for gzip; bgzip does not embed the filename but the change may have other effects. For example, bgzip's error checking (e.g. in disk full situations) may well be more complete in the typical invocation than when writing to standard output.). It is also less clear than the straightforward invocation, so using this would be a hack. 4. The resulting code is IMHO overall less clear than the original version in which the resource group models the relationship between all three filenames.

Availability,"EDIT2:. OK, so, I'm not sure when this behavior changed but Make 4.0 wants a `\` to indicate that the recipe continues on the next line *but also* passes that backslash and newline to the shell. In Make 3.81, the `\` was also required but the newline and backslash *are not passed* to the shell. In other words: in 3.81, backslash-newline is always replaced with a space and in 4.0, backslash-newline is replaced with a space *except on recipe lines in which case it is necessary to indicate the recipe continues but it is also passed literally to the shell*. The docs page you linked directly addresses our use case and suggests we put the command inside of a make variable (thus triggering normal backslash-newline rules rather than the special recipe line rules). > Sometimes you want to split a long line inside of single quotes, but you donâ€™t want the backslash/newline to appear in the quoted content. This is often the case when passing scripts to languages such as Perl, where extraneous backslashes inside the script can change its meaning or even be a syntax error. One simple way of handling this is to place the quoted string, or even the entire command, into a make variable then use the variable in the recipe. In this situation the newline quoting rules for makefiles will be used, and the backslash/newline will be removed. If we rewrite our example above using this method:; > ; > ```; > HELLO = 'hello \; > world'; > ; > all : ; @echo $(HELLO); > ```; > ; > we will get output like this:; > ; > ```; > hello world; > ```; >; > If you like, you can also use target-specific variables (see [Target-specific Variable Values](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Target_002dspecific.html)) to obtain a tighter correspondence between the variable and the recipe that uses it. It seems to me like there are not any great choices. Putting the JSON into a Make variable seems too magical and likely to confuse a newbie editing this file.

Availability,"For your considerationâ€¦ We often have a `pathlib.Path` or `cloudpathlib.CloudPath` that we've built up by parts, which is then the path to be used as an input resource:. ```python; res = mybatch.read_input(str(mycloudpath)); ```. Periodically we accidentally omit the `str(â€¦)`, which leads to a semi-obscure error message and an extra editing round-trip. There is a point of view that `read_input()` and `read_input_group()` could also accept `os.PathLike` objects directly, and have Hail convert them to `str` itself, e.g. in `_new_input_resource_file()` which underlies both methods, as per this PR. The difficulty is how to do that conversion: `str(â€¦)` does the trick for [`pathlib.Path`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/pathlib.html#operators) and [`cloudpathlib.CloudPath`](https://cloudpathlib.drivendata.org/stable/api-reference/cloudpath/), returning the path and URL, respectively, as a string. But it looks like in theory there might be [`os.PathLike`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.PathLike) subclasses that don't define `__str__()` to produce a usable path/URL. The official conversion method appears to be [`os.fspath()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fspath), but that does not do the right thing for `cloudpath.CloudPath` â€” there it downloads the remote file and returns a local path â€” which is not at all what Hail needs.

Availability,"Further pruned. Removed all GraphQL libraries, besides graphql-tag, which I like, because 1) simple hash-based cache: no need to walk complex graph to normalize cache, because in most cases I'm perfectly fine with not re-using cache across different queries (that may have some shared fields). Apollo does something ""smarter"", but much slower: walks a query, checks that the requested fields for a node are the same, and that the node's id is the same, as some other query. 2) no runtime validation of query shape via graphql-tag...uses simple template strings, which are free. We don't care about schema validation in the client...because the server will error when schema is invalid. This should be compile time validated instead, in this case via integration tests. Also removed react-icons... I was going to use this in place of material-design-icons, because I thought loading the full font, when I needed only a few icons, would be unnecessarily expensive. It turns out that I cannot find a library where a single icon import (react-icons or MaterialUI) is smaller than Google's entire material design font: a single font (there are several needed to cover all icons) is ~500B. A single react-icons icon is ~2KB on dev (production may be smaller due to tree shaking). Also, am opposed to CSS-in-JS: slower, worse tooling, larger.

Availability,"Hey @natestockham,. I'm glad you resolved the breeze issue. I imagine you were encountering a situation where the native libraries were not extant / not where expected / not the correct architecture. Three of the newly failing tests are related to plink. The output included in `tests.zip` indicates that you're using a fairly old version of plink,; ```; PLINK v1.90b1b 64-bit (20 May 2014); ```; Our testing server uses versions of plink from 2016. It's possible these tests are over constrained and need to be relaxed. I will investigate the precision required to pass the two tests in `IBDSuite`. However, part of one failure in the `IBDSuite` and the failure in the `ImputeSexSuite` are both caused by plink failing to produce output on certain input files. I strongly suspect these are bugs in plink version `1.90b1b` because plink `1.90b3.38` (from 2016, the version used on our test server) does not err on such files. This leaves one final test: `LinearMixedRegressionSuite.genAndFitLMM`. This is the test I have been writing about above and I can confirm that this is a bug (or, perhaps, overly precise test) **on our end** that we are actively investigating. Hail is usable even though the tests do not pass (you can run `./gradlew shadowJar` to produce a working jar), but I will advise you against relying on the results of `lmmreg` until we can confirm why this test is failing.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/1419#issuecomment-281861771:621,failure,failure,621,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/1419#issuecomment-281861771,2,['failure'],['failure']
Availability,"Hi @danking, thanks for this. On the topic of asserts, there are really two interacting issues:. 1. Asserts are intended to ensure invariants, i.e. conditions that should always be true. In correct code, assertions should never raise so disabling them should have no consequences at runtime. In practice, however, they are often casually used to catch value errors, which can be expected to occur if a user-facing method receives bad/nonsensical inputs (e.g. here: https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/1940547d35ddddb084ad52684e36153c1e03a331/hail/python/hailtop/hailctl/dataproc/diagnose.py#L62); 2. Python's language design allows anyone calling your code to disable asserts for optimization purposes, because disabling asserts should never change the semantics of the program. Putting these two features together, you can arrive at a situation where a user thinks they're turning off asserts (which should never raise anyway) and instead stops catching value errors (whose absence can never be guaranteed). All that said, if the final answer is: ""if you invoke `-O` you deserve what's coming"", I'm happy to drop it :). Thanks for taking a look at the example. If I understand you correctly, it sounds like I passed the wrong inputs to the function, in which case it might be clearer to raise a ValueError instead of an AssertionError in the end. On a closer look, it seems like most of the instances of `assert(x, y)` are actually in scala code-- my mistake.

Availability,"I wanted to chime in on this briefly because I think it a good example use case and its design will influence many future methods, so it is important to get the design right. Thoughts:. - the underscore stuff is a non-starter in my opinion, and too clever by half. A lot of my feedback on your stuff is guided by the general heuristic that you should start by writing down the code you want, and then decide how to implement. You'd never want to write this _ stuff if you didn't have to. - I'm still not quite sure what tablify does (in part because the name is too clever by half and in part because it doesn't appear to always return tables). - But I think the idea of tablify is something we want, which is to convert (possibly indexed expressions) back into relational objects (Table, MatrixTable) because the latter support a wider set of operations and don't have the ""source mismatch problem"". Tim and I discussed this yesterday and we suggest the following interface:. ```; t = build_table(); .set_globals(x = 5, batch = batch); .set_rows(locus = locus, aaf = aaf); .build(); ```. and. ```; mt = build_table_matix(); .set_globals(dataset = dataset); .set_rows(locus = locus, aaf = aaf); .set_entries(GT = GT); .build(); ```. where the input expressions for each part must all come from the same source (or be compatible, e.g., constants) and the resulting (matrix) table inherits the keys from the original table.

Availability,"I'm fairly certain I know understand this and the AoU VDS creation issue. In Dataproc versions 1.5.74, 2.0.48, and 2.1.0, Dataproc introduced ""memory protection"" which is a euphemism for a newly aggressive OOMKiller. When the OOMKiller kills the JVM driver process, there is no hs_err_pid...log file, no exceptional log statements, and no clean shutdown of any sockets. The process is simply SIGTERM'ed and then SIGKILL'ed. From Hail 0.2.83 through Hail 0.2.109 (released February 2023), Hail was pinned to Dataproc 2.0.44. From Hail 0.2.15 onwards, `hailctl dataproc`, by default, reserves 80% of the advertised memory of the driver node for the use of the Hail Query Driver JVM process. For example, Google advertises that an n1-highmem-8 has 52 GiB of RAM, so Hail sets the `spark:spark.driver.memory` property to `41g` (we always round down). Before aggressive memory protection, this setting was sufficient to protect the driver from starving itself of memory. Unfortunately, Hail 0.2.110 upgraded to Dataproc 2.1.2 which enabled ""memory protection"". Moreover, in the years since Hail 0.2.15, the memory in use by system processes on Dataproc driver nodes appears to have increased. Due to these two circumstances, the driver VM's memory usage can grow high enough to trigger the OOMKiller before the JVM triggers a GC. Consider, for example, these slices of the syslog of the n1-highmem-8 driver VM of a Dataproc cluster:. ```; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: earlyoom v1.6.2; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: mem total: 52223 MiB, swap total: 0 MiB; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: sending SIGTERM when mem <= 0.12% and swap <= 1.00%,; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: SIGKILL when mem <= 0.06% and swap <= 0.50%; ...; Nov 22 14:30:05 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m post-hdfs-startup-script[7747]: + echo 'All done'; Nov 22 14:30:05 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m post-hdfs-startup-script[7",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1836844790:840,down,down,840,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1836844790,1,['down'],['down']

It mainly adds light route-matching capabilities, to avoid repeating boilerplate when writing the Node server. Easy to follow. It's also the fastest ""framework"" available, outside of C/Go/Rust.

My guess is that Kubernetes takes too long to generate the response, either due to garbage collection, or simply because the requested information takes N > 120 seconds to return.

Availability,"OK, I've made most of the changes and I'd appreciate some feedback before I finalize the PR. Notable changes:; - The `hailctl dataproc` subcommand now has `--beta`, `--configuration=`, `--dry-run`, `--project=` and `--zone=`. These apply to all commands. There is a `GcloudRunner` object that takes these options, is set to the click context user `obj` field, and is used by all hailctl dataproc commands to invoke gcloud. Note, not all dataproc subcommands invoke gcloud, but the current design doesn't differentiate. Note, with `click`, the subcommand options must go on the subcommand, so `hailctl dataproc stop --dry-run` is an error.; - hailctl no longer takes `--region` (for gcloud dataproc commands). I compute region in `GcloudRunner` by checking dataproc/region or falling back to determining the region from the zone. I error if the region and zone are incompatible (gcloud would also do this).; - I stripped all gcloud pass through args from `hailctl dataproc modify`. There aren't any left. Invoking `modify` now looks like:. ```; hailctl dataproc modify my-cluster \; --extra-glcoud-update-args='---num-workers=2 --num-secondary-workers=100'; ```. The `extra` in the option name sounds a little weird since they are the only options (and the command isn't run if they aren't specified), but I'm leaving it for consistency for now. I moved the help text from the removed options into the help for the modify command itself. The output of `modify --help` is included below.; - I plan to leave the `--async` option to stop, although it is pass through.; - Then there is `--files` for submit. This is passed through, but `--py-files` is needed (it is not passed through, but modified). Do I leave `--files`? I'm currently inclined to.; - Finally, I need to strip out the pass through arguments for start like I did with update. ```; $ hailctl dataproc modify --help; Usage: hailctl dataproc modify [OPTIONS] CLUSTER_NAME.

Availability,"Thanks @danking for helping with this, and for the nudge to finally get it implemented!. Some more next steps:; * Make a benchmarking setup to collect data on performance and accuracy. I want to use the same metrics for measuring error as [here](http://quantiles.github.io/) (Kolmogorov-Smirnov divergence and total variation distance between the true and estimated CDFs, which are both simple to compute). As a first sanity check, we should get numbers in the same ballpark as they did (worse at first, because we started with a very naive algorithm).; * Make improvements to the algorithm, evaluating the gains in the benchmarks.; * When we feel we understand the behavior of the accuracy measures, we can pick a conservative upper error bound and turn that into an automated test.; * Also once we understand the behavior of the accuracy measures, figure out how to communicate that to users. One thought is to offer a few default choices of parameters, and for each document memory usage, empirical error from our benchmarks, and a theoretical upper bound on the error (of the form ""with probability > .99 the estimated q quantile element will have true quantile q Â± .001"").

Availability,"The doc wasn't very clear about where information lived. I had imagined that the pools and the JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM) owned the information. Nit: the doc doesn't say the instance monitor monitors instances, it just monitors and handles *events*. Let me be explicit: I think the doc is wrong about the monitor doing health checking because that requires it to track the instances, which I just said should be owned by the pools and the JPIM. That didn't occur to me when we were writing the doc, my apologies. I still think the monitor should:; - route events to the right pool or to the JPIM, and; - aggregate summaries up for the web UI. ---. Let me try to be more specific in my critique:. I think of the system as three layers: the top most is the driver, the middle layer is the monitor, and the bottom layer is the pool or JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM). I don't want control flow to go down, up, and back down again. If that happens, then we can't reason about our system as separate layers, we necessarily have to think about the middle and bottom layer together. Very specifically, this flow worries me: (instance pool) create_instance -> (instance monitor) add_instance -> adjust_for_add_instance -> (instance pool) adjust_for_add_instance. We move from low to mid *back to low*. I want information to flow in one direction: either its downward information or its upward information. ---. I'm guessing you're also concerned about code organization / code duplication. I'm not that worried about this. The JPIM and the Pool are similar things and we might inevitably produce some duplication. That's OK with me. To be honest, I think a few stand-alone functions that both of them use will eliminate any code duplication. Both pools and the JPIM will have a `name_instances` and `instance_by_last_updated`. If the duplication gets hard to manage, we might pack that up into another class like InstanceCollection. I realize this means we have several monitoring loops.

Availability,"This PR implements the beginning of the EmitCode and CodeBuilder change discussed here: https://dev.hail.is/t/on-the-subject-of-emittriplet/183/7. The codegen rule for ArrayRef is now the delightfully clear and concise:. ```; EmitCode.fromI(mb) { cb =>; emit(a).toI(cb).flatMap(cb) { (ac) =>; emit(i).toI(cb).flatMap(cb) { (ic) =>; val av = ac.asIndexable.memoize(cb, ""aref_a""); val iv = cb.memoize(ic.tcode[Int], ""aref_i""). cb.ifx(iv < 0 || iv >= av.loadLength(), {; cb._fatal(errorTransformer(; const(""array index out of bounds: index=""); .concat(iv.toS); .concat("", length=""); .concat(av.loadLength().toS))); }); av.loadElement(cb, iv); }; }; }; ```. Summary of changes:. Introduce CodeBuilder. CodeBuilder allows for the imperative, sequential construction of code. The idea is that it is the imperative analog of Code[Unit]. In this analogy, a function returning Code[Unit] becomes a function that takes a CodeBuilder, alternatively, a Code[Unit] can become a CodeLabel: the place to jump to run a given computation. In addition to CodeBuilder, I have a imperative implementation of EmitCode that is similar to the proposal in the dev post: IEmitCode. Under the above analog, the proposal in the dev post would become:. ```; trait IEmitCode {; def apply(missing: (CodeBuilder) => Unit, present: (CodeBuilder, PValue) => Unit): Unit; }; ```. However, I took the additional step of ""defunctionalizing"" this picture by using labels instead of functions of code, giving:. ```; case class IEmitCode(Lmissing: CodeLabel, Lpresent: CodeLabel, pc: PCode) {; ...; }; ```. In this model, the emit function will become: `Emit.emit(cb: CodeBuilder, ...): IEmitCode`. The discipline is after calling `emit`, the contents of the code builder, when executed, will jump to one of `Lmissing` or `Lpresent` (labels which are not defined yet) and the consumer can define those labels, and use the expression `pc` in the code after the `Lpresent` label only.

The problem is that in our generated code, every literal is decoded *each time any literal is referenced*. This is **extremely** expensive! . In this change, we instead decode the literals once with the function is constructed from the partition index (used with randomness), by adding a new region argument which the literals are decoded into. This region must live as long as the RegionValues returned by any invocation of the function. The primary error mode I might expect is that we use the wrong region to generate the function, causing use-after-free errors. These are well-covered by tests, since I had a few of these bugs and fixed them due to test failures.

Availability,"This is caused by domain-by-domain CSRF tokens introduced in [#14180](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14180). An unfortunate side effect is that the tokens available on non-auth pages are no longer able to validate requests to the auth/logout API. Given the lack of apparent noise about this bug in our issues and zulip I suspect that this is not a common path for users, and that a fix along the lines of ""require add one button click to go to the User page first before logging out is acceptable"". On the other hand, the risk of a user clicking on the broken Logout button and believing themselves to be logged out when seeing a `401: Unauthorized` page (but actually still having logged-in state in their browser) raises this in my mind to a security bug rather than just a UX bug or an unfortunate user experience. Therefore my proposal is:; 1. To fix the bug as soon as possible; 2. Accept an additional redirect in a user flow which is rarely exercised; 3. To make the smallest number of potentially risky changes to the underlying security architecture; 4. Therefore: Remove the broken ""log out"" link in page headers and replace with a Log out button on the auth[...]/users page which is guaranteed to have the correct CSRF token in state.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14635#issuecomment-2253086187:163,avail,available,163,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14635#issuecomment-2253086187,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"Working backwards, we need to not return a 500 on error. We could return a BadRequest error code with the message 'invalid spec' and then handle the MJC database call on the driver. I chose instead to have the worker to post job complete so we get the error message with the stack trace showing up in the UI as having the normal job flow seemed cleaner to me last week then special casing `schedule_job` on the driver. `post job complete` needs a job object to get the status to send back to the driver. However, a `Job` has two concrete implementations and we don't know which the bad job is because we can't get the spec. Furthermore, the `Job` class does a lot of work based on the spec right now. So I thought it was clearer to just create a new class that had the status, but nothing else. After writing this out, it's probably better to have the driver MJC upon error rather than from the worker. The code below would be more complicated. We'd have to get the traceback / error message from the response from the worker. ```python3; try:; await client_session.post(; f'http://{instance.ip_address}:5000/api/v1alpha/batches/jobs/create',; json=body,; timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=2),; ); await instance.mark_healthy(); except aiohttp.ClientResponseError as e:; await instance.mark_healthy(); if e.status == 403:; log.info(f'attempt already exists for job {id} on {instance}, aborting'); if e.status == 503:; log.info(f'job {id} cannot be scheduled because {instance} is shutting down, aborting'); raise e; except Exception:; await instance.incr_failed_request_count(); raise; ```.

Notice:; 1. The total memory available on the machine is less than 52 GiB (= 53,248 MiB), indeed it is a full 1025 MiB below the advertised amount.; 2. Once all the components of the Dataproc cluster have started (but before any Hail Query jobs are submitted) the total memory available is already depleted to 42760 MiB. Recall that Hail allocates 41 GiB (= 41,984 MiB) to its JVM. This leaves the Python process and all other daemons on the system only 776 MiB of excess RAM. For reference `python3 -c 'import hail'` needs 206 MiB. ---. We must address this situation. It seems safe to assume that the system daemons will use a constant 9.5 GiB of RAM. Moreover the advertised RAM amount is at least 1 GiB larger than reality. I propose:; 1. The driver memory calculation in `hailctl dataproc` should take the advertised RAM amount, subtract 10.5 GiB, and then use 90% of the remaining value. For an n1-highmem-8, that reduces our allocation from 41 GiB to 37 GiB yielding an additional 4GiB to Python and deamon memory fluctuations.; 2. AoU RWB needs to review its memory settings for Spark driver nodes to ensure that the JVM is set to an appropriate maximum heap size. For what it's worth, I think the reason we didn't get an outcry from our local scientific community is that many of them have transitioned to Query-on-Batch where we have exact and total control over the memory available to the driver and the workers.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1836844790:3538,avail,available,3538,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1836844790,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"crossposting from a message I sent to the variants team. ---. #### executive summary. Excess JVM memory use is almost certainly not the issue. I've taken a close look at the import_gvs.py loop and the related Hail Python code. No obvious accumulation of RAM use. AFAICT, the oomkiller keeps killing the pipelines. We need to stop this because the oomkiller (a) acts before the JVM GC can free things and (b) prevents us from getting JVM diagnostics on failure. We control the JVM's max heap with hailctl's --master-memory-fraction (default is 0.8 for 80% of the master machine type's advertised RAM). I suggest we set this down to 0.6 and continue using an n1-highmem-16 driver.; If Hail is (incorrectly) accumulating garbage memory per-group, we'll have a better chance diagnosing that with a running JVM instead of one that's been SIGKILL'ed. To understand what's going on, we gotta see what is using RAM in the n1-highmem-16 case. If I could SSH to the cluster, a simple solution is a screen with top -s 300 -n 100 >memory.log (I'd guess no more than 500KiB per hour of logs) and retrieve that file if the cluster fails. If we could get Google Monitoring set up to retrieve process-level memory statistics from the driver node that should also work. Just to be clear, I don't anticipate any changes to Hail in the next week that would change the memory use of this pipeline. There could be a memory leak, but I have no clews that lead to it. I realize this is an unsatisfying answer. I'm pretty perplexed as to what could be the issue here. #### technical details. We'll call the second to most recent run Run A and the most recent run Run B. Run A (like all runs before it) only manages two sample groups before failing. Run B made it through 50 groups before failing on 51. Why did they fail? The syslog for Run A is clear: the oomkiller killed Run A. We lack syslogs for Run B, so we cannot be certain but the lack of a JVM stack trace suggests to me that (a) the driver failed and (b) the drive",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1832666449:452,failure,failure,452,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1832666449,2,"['down', 'failure']","['down', 'failure']"

If I had one secret with all the certs, then when a service starts up it has to select the trusted ones and only insert those into its certificate store. This seems OK, but a little harder to inspect. Duplicating a cert for each trust list to which it belongs occupies what seems like a good spot to me from a developer ergonomics perspective:; - O(trusts) modifications necessary to update/revoke the cert; - O(1) configuration to load a trust list; - no pod-start-time configuration; - the trust list is on the container's file system, so its easy to inspect. Small point: I don't pin the incoming certs yet due to the mTLS challenges. ### create on each deploy. Only creating certs if they don't exist is an easy change. Seems fine, though leaves unresolved how to rotate the certs. I guess I'm inclined to always recreate because it makes rotation the common case, forcing us to make it work well. I think the only way to do a no-downtime rotation is:; 1. create fresh certs; 2. create the trust lists including a principal's fresh cert and previous generation cert; 3. update all the secrets; 4. somehow ensure everyone has the latest secrets?; 5. notify all servers to refresh their certificates (nginx: send SIGHUP, aiohttp: we have to write something). We could stick a generation uuid in the secrets and keep refreshing services until the certificate uuid they read is the one our deploy expects. ### mTLS. This PR will land. Things will break because the unmanaged services (router-resolver, gateway, internal-gateway) do not speak TLS. I'll manually deploy them. The default namespace and new PR namespaces should now function properly. Developers will need to redeploy from master.

Availability,"his pull request, linked above, I chose Starlette, and it is a thin abstraction, nearly identical performance, over Uvicorn + httptools, which were both written by Yury Selivanov, the asyncio person I mention above. Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 . Starlette is something like base Go performance (though 1/5-1/10th the performance of Go's fasthttp library for simple responses, and much closer for anything involving database calls). Sanic also uses httptools and uvloop, but has more stuff.. so yeah maybe a bit slower than Starlette, or not, but the diff will probably be small. Regarding the benchmark you linked, it is benchmarking the power of sleep. There is something deeply wrong with their results. Sanic has 1800 timeouts, vs 200 for aiohttp, and 3x the connection errors. Fine, so Sanic is super slow. But look at their non-db tests. Sanic is >2x as fast, 0 timeouts. They aren't using anything Sanic specific to query the database, and both use the same event loop. Adding asyncio Postgres to two programs that fundamentally differ mainly in how the handle http requests and responses, shows the one that is faster at http requests/responses (Sanic) becoming much slower, and in fact reversing its relationship to Aiohttp. This is strange to say the least. I was really curious about this, so I ran the bench. First, I upgraded Sanic to a recent version. Then I ran their test. In short, their results were not what I found. Sanic is 50% faster, and the timeouts are what you'd expect. 26 timeouts for Sanic, 45 for aiohttp.

I haven't investigated this. I agree, there exists an inflection point where the size of data overcomes GCS latency and GCS-throughput / tar-decompress is the bottleneck. There's something to be said for tar'ing everything except for `.git`, but I didn't carefully check which steps need it and which steps do not. ---. In conclusion, I'd say this PR is necessary for #7534, and #7534 is a big quality of life improvement for those of us with large repos running tests on images that are deep on the critical path (the shuffler test is behind 3 images and build hail, which also clones the repo, so for my repo I wait at least 2 minutes before I even have a chance to get feedback; with this PR and #7534 I should wait like 45 seconds?).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7626#issuecomment-560442927:1442,down,downstream,1442,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7626#issuecomment-560442927,1,['down'],['downstream']

Availability,"it is the imperative analog of Code[Unit]. In this analogy, a function returning Code[Unit] becomes a function that takes a CodeBuilder, alternatively, a Code[Unit] can become a CodeLabel: the place to jump to run a given computation. In addition to CodeBuilder, I have a imperative implementation of EmitCode that is similar to the proposal in the dev post: IEmitCode. Under the above analog, the proposal in the dev post would become:. ```; trait IEmitCode {; def apply(missing: (CodeBuilder) => Unit, present: (CodeBuilder, PValue) => Unit): Unit; }; ```. However, I took the additional step of ""defunctionalizing"" this picture by using labels instead of functions of code, giving:. ```; case class IEmitCode(Lmissing: CodeLabel, Lpresent: CodeLabel, pc: PCode) {; ...; }; ```. In this model, the emit function will become: `Emit.emit(cb: CodeBuilder, ...): IEmitCode`. The discipline is after calling `emit`, the contents of the code builder, when executed, will jump to one of `Lmissing` or `Lpresent` (labels which are not defined yet) and the consumer can define those labels, and use the expression `pc` in the code after the `Lpresent` label only. Because obviously I haven't converted everything to the imperative style (yet), I wrote routines to convert them back and forth: `EmitCode.fromI { cb => ... }` provides a CodeBuilder and converts a resulting IEmitCode back to an EmitCode, and EmitCode.toI(cb) does the opposite. There is also `(Emit)CodeBuilder.scoped` that will run a code builder function and collect the code as a Code[Unit]. A second idea introduced in this PR is that some PType operations may only be available on a PSettable/PValue, rather than on PCode. The motivation is the canonical array ref implementation, which involves a lot of duplicate code generation. In the current setup, we can have a compound PValue, and this introduces a PCanonicalIndexableValue that has three fields: the base array address, the length and the elements addresss.

Notice:; 1. The total memory available on the machine is less than 52 GiB (= 53,248 MiB), indeed it is a full 1025 MiB below the advertised amount.; 2. Once all the components of the Dataproc cluster have started (but before any Hail Query jobs are submitted) the total memory available is already depleted to 42760 MiB. Recall that Hail allocates 41 GiB (= 41,984 MiB) to its JVM. This leaves the Python process and all other daemons on the system only 776 MiB of excess RAM. For reference `python3 -c 'import hail'` needs 206 MiB. ---. We must address this situation. It seems safe to assume that the system daemons will use a constant 9.5 GiB of RAM. Moreover the advertised RAM amount is at least 1 GiB larger than reality. I propose:; 1. The driver memory calculation in `hailctl dataproc` should take the advertised RAM amount, subtract 10.5 GiB, and then use 90% of the remaining value. For an n1-highmem-8, that reduces our allocation from 41 GiB to 37 GiB yielding an additional 4GiB to Python and deamon memory fluctuations.; 2. AoU RWB needs to review its memory settings for Spark driver nodes to ensure that the JVM is set to an appropriate maximum heap size.

Availability,"nformation. Nit: the doc doesn't say the instance monitor monitors instances, it just monitors and handles *events*. Let me be explicit: I think the doc is wrong about the monitor doing health checking because that requires it to track the instances, which I just said should be owned by the pools and the JPIM. That didn't occur to me when we were writing the doc, my apologies. I still think the monitor should:; - route events to the right pool or to the JPIM, and; - aggregate summaries up for the web UI. ---. Let me try to be more specific in my critique:. I think of the system as three layers: the top most is the driver, the middle layer is the monitor, and the bottom layer is the pool or JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM). I don't want control flow to go down, up, and back down again. If that happens, then we can't reason about our system as separate layers, we necessarily have to think about the middle and bottom layer together. Very specifically, this flow worries me: (instance pool) create_instance -> (instance monitor) add_instance -> adjust_for_add_instance -> (instance pool) adjust_for_add_instance. We move from low to mid *back to low*. I want information to flow in one direction: either its downward information or its upward information. ---. I'm guessing you're also concerned about code organization / code duplication. I'm not that worried about this. The JPIM and the Pool are similar things and we might inevitably produce some duplication. That's OK with me. To be honest, I think a few stand-alone functions that both of them use will eliminate any code duplication. Both pools and the JPIM will have a `name_instances` and `instance_by_last_updated`. If the duplication gets hard to manage, we might pack that up into another class like InstanceCollection. I realize this means we have several monitoring loops. I'm not very worried about that. I think it's fine and it helps simplify the architecture. It avoids entangling the monitor with the pools and the JPIM.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9772#issuecomment-738515358:1357,down,downward,1357,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9772#issuecomment-738515358,1,['down'],['downward']

As written it doesn't appear that it would work because there doesn't exist any regenie source code to COPY in. It's meant to create a Regenie docker image that we could use. It's a copy of the regenie c++ repo's dockerfile, with the removal of the ENTRYPOINT /usr/local/bin/regenie, so that I could issue a command that included an executable, which is convenient to give me the ability to check that intermediate files are actually created (wc, ls) by batch, and because that seems more idiomatic for batch.

Deployability," fairly certain I know understand this and the AoU VDS creation issue. In Dataproc versions 1.5.74, 2.0.48, and 2.1.0, Dataproc introduced ""memory protection"" which is a euphemism for a newly aggressive OOMKiller. When the OOMKiller kills the JVM driver process, there is no hs_err_pid...log file, no exceptional log statements, and no clean shutdown of any sockets. The process is simply SIGTERM'ed and then SIGKILL'ed. From Hail 0.2.83 through Hail 0.2.109 (released February 2023), Hail was pinned to Dataproc 2.0.44. From Hail 0.2.15 onwards, `hailctl dataproc`, by default, reserves 80% of the advertised memory of the driver node for the use of the Hail Query Driver JVM process. For example, Google advertises that an n1-highmem-8 has 52 GiB of RAM, so Hail sets the `spark:spark.driver.memory` property to `41g` (we always round down). Before aggressive memory protection, this setting was sufficient to protect the driver from starving itself of memory. Unfortunately, Hail 0.2.110 upgraded to Dataproc 2.1.2 which enabled ""memory protection"". Moreover, in the years since Hail 0.2.15, the memory in use by system processes on Dataproc driver nodes appears to have increased.

Duplicating a cert for each trust list to which it belongs occupies what seems like a good spot to me from a developer ergonomics perspective:; - O(trusts) modifications necessary to update/revoke the cert; - O(1) configuration to load a trust list; - no pod-start-time configuration; - the trust list is on the container's file system, so its easy to inspect. Small point: I don't pin the incoming certs yet due to the mTLS challenges. ### create on each deploy. Only creating certs if they don't exist is an easy change. Seems fine, though leaves unresolved how to rotate the certs. I guess I'm inclined to always recreate because it makes rotation the common case, forcing us to make it work well. I think the only way to do a no-downtime rotation is:; 1. create fresh certs; 2. create the trust lists including a principal's fresh cert and previous generation cert; 3. update all the secrets; 4. somehow ensure everyone has the latest secrets?; 5. notify all servers to refresh their certificates (nginx: send SIGHUP, aiohttp: we have to write something). We could stick a generation uuid in the secrets and keep refreshing services until the certificate uuid they read is the one our deploy expects. ### mTLS. This PR will land. Things will break because the unmanaged services (router-resolver, gateway, internal-gateway) do not speak TLS. I'll manually deploy them. The default namespace and new PR namespaces should now function properly. Developers will need to redeploy from master. With this in place, I will make another PR with two main changes:; - enable client verification, and; - modify create_certs.py to load the unmanaged certificates from `default` rather than the local namespace.; That PR should pass all the tests (batch pods will speak TLS to internal-gateway; internal-gateway will speak TLS to PR batch using a client certificate PR batch trusts; etc.).

Deployability,"1. For runImage steps, you can only copy out-of or copy into `/io` (the reasoning is a bit complicated and somewhat historical).; 2. For buildImage steps, you can copy out-of or copy into `/`; 3. the `to` of an `output` specifies a file path in a ""filesystem"" that another step can access if it `dependsOn` the outputting step; 4. the `from` of an `input` specifies a file path in the aforementioned ""filesystem""; the filesystem contains all `outputs` from steps in the inputting step's `dependsOn` clause. We also have a `docker/Makefile` which is an emergency manual build system. I update that so that `hail_version` appears in the root of the docker context. The `service-base` uses the entire repository as its docker context, so I place hail_version at the root of the repository. I moved the `version` function from `hailtop.hailctl` into `hailtop`. It seems broadly useful and isn't specific to hailctl in anyway. Your concern about loading from pkg_resources repeated seems well-founded, so I went ahead and loaded the hail_version at package import time. This seems likely to ensure we learn about a missing hail_version file as early as possible (presumably at service start-time). This also means all hailtop installs need a hail_version file. I only found two other places that use hailtop. One of them was a completely unused Dockerfile. I deleted that (`Dockerfile.hailtop`). The other was Dockerfile.ci-test, which I updated to copy the hail_version file just like service-base. https://github.com/hail-is/hail/compare/main...danking:add-version-endpoint. Do you want to cherry-pick that change onto your add-version-endpoint branch?. One more change request: can we remove the try-catch? I don't expect any errors in that call and I tend to avoid revealing anything about errors to our users. Aiohttp will log the error and the stack trace if you let it rise all the way.

It is *not* sufficient for an image to be present in the repository and untagged or with a different tag from `latest`. In particular, every push to the `cache` tag prevents us from using other images even though they are in the registry!

Deployability,"> Ah sorry, I forgot to update the original commit message as that's not actually correct. The optimization is that we don't need to iterate through all blobs until we find the exact blob matching our path name. The list operation returns all blobs that start with the prefix of that path. If we see a blob with a different name that is a child of our path f'{path}/foo, then we know it's a directory and don't need to iterate anymore (although it could be a file as well, but in Scala we don't currently throw errors on paths that are both files and directories, so we just choose the first we see). If we see a blob that matches the path exactly, then we know it's a file and stop iterating. The only reason we need to iterate through more than one blob is if there's blobs that are like '{path}zzzzz/foo or '{path}szzzzz. We need to ignore these as they don't provide any information on whether {path} is a file or directory. This is where isChildOf is needed because we need to make sure the blob is actually a child of the path such as '{path}/file and not {path}zzzzz/file. Ah thanks, this makes more sense to me now. > The other option is to do 2 queries. One to check if it's a file and the next to check if there are any child blobs.

By composability, I mean each IR should have a (local) contract, and each program composed from that local contract should be valid.

A 2nd question: how would a contributor submit write hybrid hail query/batch code that called batch from within a hail query script? So hail transforms data, say generates pc's, writes table, and then issues some batch commands that use a pre-built image, as opposed to requiring them to containerise their hail cod3. This will be useful: containerisation is the stated biggest pain point of batch, from my interviews. And one of the biggest hail issues is shuttling data between hail and other processes, which has led people to ask for tighter integration, or more statistical tools (so that they don't need to go out to those other tools, like plink). Showing Batch working from within hail-query scripts would be useful because it will show a much easier integration, and those examples or contributed modules should live somewhere (and that seems not to be hailtop, because this requires batch to be called from code that is calling hail directly, rather than through an image).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9194#issuecomment-671459432:127,install,installed,127,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9194#issuecomment-671459432,4,"['install', 'integrat']","['installed', 'integration']"
Deployability,"> The end we're taking the max (in our favor). I'm not totally comfortable with that, e.g. a preemption happens after a job is finished, but the preemption event gets recorded first, you'll charge the user up to the preemption (max) even tho the job already finished. That doesn't seem right. So I see two options:. I intended to always take the min (user's favor) for the end time and the start time should never change but if it does I take it to be earlier in our favor. If the trigger isn't doing that then I got it wrong. Basically, the way I understood the trigger is as follows:. ```; IF OLD.end_time IS NOT NULL AND (NEW.end_time IS NULL OR NEW.end_time > OLD.end_time) THEN; SET NEW.end_time = OLD.end_time;; SET NEW.reason = OLD.reason;; END IF;; ```.

Note, not all dataproc subcommands invoke gcloud, but the current design doesn't differentiate. Note, with click, the subcommand options must go on the subcommand, so hailctl dataproc stop --dry-run is an error. Nice.

I believe the only reason that we currently require a zone be provided either in gcloud configuration or on the command line is to maintain backwards compatibility. `cloudtools` and earlier versions of `hailctl` had a default value for the `--zone` option of `hailctl dataproc start` (I think it was `us-central1-b`). > I stripped all gcloud pass through args from hailctl dat",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9842#issuecomment-767168393:52,configurat,configuration,52,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9842#issuecomment-767168393,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"> The thinking behind this is that there's a huge amount of re-use of code for an individual from one Hail analysis to the next. So I'm not sure I buy this. Hail is a exploratory data analysis platform, it isn't a SQL engine running nightly billing reports. In particular, as we do whole stage optimization and code generation. It isn't clear to me how you do code-reuse when we're specializing each operation into the global context (happy to hear the plan). For example, tables that have many fields, you will need to load different ones for different queries and in general it is infeasible (exponential) to generate them all. Also, to get sharing you need to break the code up and now you're running the compiler multiple times which also seems bad. Given our focus on large-scale analysis, introducing optimization boundaries for code reuse seems like a bad trade off to me. A significant amount of analysis happens in the cloud where $HOME is ephemeral so you won't get savings between sessions. Finally, there are pipelines that are more standardized but it is my impression they are run on extremely large datasets (hours, overnight) in which case compilation speed isn't important. Finally, there's the complexity around locking that isn't easy and have real technical risk. A compiler cache potentially becomes more appealing in the context of an always-on service. There's no locking issue, and you can start to do things like speculative compilation (e.g. immediately start compiling the decoder (the full decoder? Hmm.) when a user opens the dataset.).

Deployability,"@cseed, details below, exec summary: a series of confusions and confusing interfaces lead to cloud tools deployment issues. The resolution is to fix the deploy script to always deploy `cloudtools` for python 2 and 3 (because *it* works with both). Users will need `python2` somewhere on their PATH, but `gsutil` will guide them through that, i.e. not our problem. There is no problem except that I cannot approve my own PR. I noticed @catoverdrive wasn't actually assigned, so it wasn't in her scorecard queue. ---. There was a bit of confusion around this recently that @catoverdrive figured out. So, `gsutil` only supports `python2`, but it's happy to search through your path for a variety of binaries with suggestive names until it finds a valid python 2.x binary. `cloudtools` itself works with any version of python (there was a recent breaking change in the release of python 3.7, which broke cloud tools [but that's been resolved in an open PR](https://github.com/Nealelab/cloudtools/pull/91/files#diff-7decff7c08c5270a32982ea34483b8cbR11)). Now, wrt PYPI, @catoverdrive discovered that the version of python you use to run `setup.py bdist_wheel` determines which version of python is deployed. This is rather confusing and, since none (or many?) of us did not know this, we accidentally uploaded a variety of [cloud tools versions on pypi, as you've noted](https://pypi.org/simple/cloudtools/). There was some earlier confusion wherein I thought we should only support `python2`, but that was a mistake on my end. We should support both versions, and when the user tries to start a cluster, `gsutil` will provide an error message guiding them to install `python2`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4240#issuecomment-419912588:105,deploy,deployment,105,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4240#issuecomment-419912588,6,"['deploy', 'install', 'release']","['deploy', 'deployed', 'deployment', 'install', 'release']"

To get a hot-reloading version of the web app (links to your browser, refreshes all changes): `cd packages/public && npm run dev`. To start the gateway: `cd packages/hail-api-gateway && nodemon index.js`. Dev mode routing is slow. To see a production, minified build: `cd packages/public && npm run build && npm run prod-test`.; * Build is a kind of compilation process. Dev dependencies are pruned, the app is split into static bundles, and minified. Some optimizations, like inlining of some React functions also occurs. This is independent of anything V8 does .

Deployability,"Further pruned. Removed all GraphQL libraries, besides graphql-tag, which I like, because 1) simple hash-based cache: no need to walk complex graph to normalize cache, because in most cases I'm perfectly fine with not re-using cache across different queries (that may have some shared fields). Apollo does something ""smarter"", but much slower: walks a query, checks that the requested fields for a node are the same, and that the node's id is the same, as some other query. 2) no runtime validation of query shape via graphql-tag...uses simple template strings, which are free. We don't care about schema validation in the client...because the server will error when schema is invalid. This should be compile time validated instead, in this case via integration tests. Also removed react-icons... I was going to use this in place of material-design-icons, because I thought loading the full font, when I needed only a few icons, would be unnecessarily expensive. It turns out that I cannot find a library where a single icon import (react-icons or MaterialUI) is smaller than Google's entire material design font: a single font (there are several needed to cover all icons) is ~500B. A single react-icons icon is ~2KB on dev (production may be smaller due to tree shaking). Also, am opposed to CSS-in-JS: slower, worse tooling, larger. Benefits are dynamic selectors, which are really no advantage that I can see (without them can still dynamically apply classes, as in the yee ol days of pleb vanilla js).

I feel like if we can force all batches down the new code path we'll be incentivized to make it really low overhead for batches that only submit jobs once, and that will benefit all batches, as well as simplifying the mental model. I may be wrong that we can do this with minimal performance tradeoff, but I'd like to try it first.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12010#issuecomment-1219807488:143,update,updates,143,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12010#issuecomment-1219807488,2,['update'],"['update', 'updates']"

Deployability,"I think tying the reset to the iterator is a mistake. First, iterator is the wrong abstraction here. Whole-stage code generation should use the aggregator/array strategy we're using in Emit to generate nothing, conditionals and loops for map, filter and flatMap, respectively. Ideally read ... do stuff ... write will generate an RDD with no per-element iterators at all. I want to make sure this picture is clear. Second, we want to vectorize in the database sense: we want to process multiple rows together in batches. Then overall structure of a stage is a loop over the batches, and and a loop within batches. Thus, the common case should not be we reset after every element, so I think it's the wrong direction to bake it in. The place where we do this should be interface points with the Spark stack which should be looked at with scorn and derision and as the organizing model. Finally, this points to an ongoing difference in our views about the meaning of context. I see context as serving two purposes (neither of which involve reset):. - First, context is a set of resources needed to process a partition that should be released when the partition is complete. For example, I'm working on GenomicsDB which needs to localize a GenomicsDB shard to a local file that needs to be cleaned up when the partition is complete. - Second, it is a way to tell an iterator where to return its value. (This is the ""current"" region business.). I'd be happy to separate these, but I don't see clean way. In no case do I see generic logic to manage the lifetime of regions (e.g. knowing when to call reset) inside the Context.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3365#issuecomment-381180739:1131,release,released,1131,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3365#issuecomment-381180739,1,['release'],['released']

Deployability,"I think we should find a time to discuss this in person if the following explanation doesn't make sense. . Right now, for small batches, we send one REST request to the server to both create the batch and create the jobs. However, if we want one REST request for an update (ideal for the query service and low latency jobs?), we have to use relative job ids because (1) we don't know the absolute start index of the jobs until we've gotten the start id of the update back from the server and (2) the job dependencies can be a mix of known job ids that have already been previously submitted in a previous creation/update. The negative job IDs are a way to deal with a mix of relative ids within an update and known, submitted job ids. We can simplify things if we require all updates make two requests to the server to (1) get the start id and establish the update and then (2) submit new jobs with all absolute job IDs. I'd have to make sure this will actually simplify things because I also ran into a bifurcation in how the job IDs are handled in `BatchBuilder.create_job()`. We currently populate the spec with a job id before we've made any requests to the server. We need to know how many total jobs there are before we can figure out the job ids because the API for creating a new update requires reserving a block of job IDs which then returns the start id. This complexity is because we allow multiple updates to occur simultaneously to a batch.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12010#issuecomment-1215919856:266,update,update,266,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12010#issuecomment-1215919856,8,['update'],"['update', 'updates']"
Deployability,"I think we should have the following design that runs the benchmarks in k8s because then we are using google's internal network to transmit data (compared to running on my local computer via a cloud proxy):. - Have a `db-benchmark` namespace in k8s specifically for this. 1. create_db.py; a. This will take the parameters needed for `gcloud sql instances create` including database flags, disk space, cores, etc. and create an instance; b. Get the IP address of the instance (hopefully the REST API works for this); c. Create a database; d. Create user and password for the database; e. Create config file; f. Create secret in the db-benchmark namespace from the config file; ; 2. run.py; a. Build the docker image with the benchmark.py code and installs aiomysql, etc.; b. Create pod which mounts the correct secret with the sql config for the instance to use. Environment variables specify the n_replicates, etc. Print out the pod name.; c. Wait for the pod to complete (you have code in CI that does this); d. Download logs; e. Delete the pod. 3. cleanup.py; a. Delete mysql instance; b. Delete kubernetes secret in db-benchmark namespace.

I tried to think about how to use the current build system and what I would do is add a new CreateSQLInstance step, CreateDatabase takes the instance name and IP address as a parameter, and have CI take a path to the build.yaml file to build from.

Otherwise, the batches table should only have static fields that apply to the entire batch. I think we can do callbacks and attributes on a job group. I added a PATCH endpoint to be able to update a job group's cancel_after_n_attributes as the hailtop.batch interface was going to automatically generate job groups without any configuration settings.

Deployability,"I want to respond to some of your objections to unique_ptr. > If you buy into using std::unique_ptr, then everyone who writes or reads the code has to get; their head around the massively confusing and counter-intuitive concept of move semantics (a; form of assignment which modifies the source) and the somewhat bizarre terminology and syntax; used to express that in C++. I agree that move semantics takes getting used to, but I think it is much too integrated into modern C++ to ignore, going far beyond unique_ptr. Writing interfaces that take advantage of move semantics requires understanding rvalue-references in more detail, but for users of those move-enabled interfaces I think the guidelines are easy to teach: a variable will only be modified by moving if it is explicitly tagged with a `std::move`, so all you have to remember is ""after a `std::move(foo)`, the variable `foo` may only be assigned to or deleted."". > And then you get into a whole host of associated design decisions (I'm holding this as a unique_ptr,; but I want to pass it to a function - should I pass it as a raw pointer ? a raw reference ? a reference; to the unique_ptr ?). Keeping in mind the model that letting a function/class `foo` hold a `unique_ptr<Widget>` means explicitly ""`foo` owns this Widget, and is responsible for deleting it or passing ownership somewhere else"", these questions have pretty clear answers. * If a function `bar` takes a `Widget` but isn't concerned with its lifetime management, it should take its argument as a `Widget*` or `Widget&`, with the usual reasoning to choose between them. The caller owns the widget, and the lifetime of `bar` is nested inside that of its caller, so lifetime management isn't an issue.; * If `bar` takes a `Widget` and needs to take ownership, it should take its argument as a `unique_ptr<Widget>`.

Deployability,"I'm fairly certain I know understand this and the AoU VDS creation issue. In Dataproc versions 1.5.74, 2.0.48, and 2.1.0, Dataproc introduced ""memory protection"" which is a euphemism for a newly aggressive OOMKiller. When the OOMKiller kills the JVM driver process, there is no hs_err_pid...log file, no exceptional log statements, and no clean shutdown of any sockets. The process is simply SIGTERM'ed and then SIGKILL'ed. From Hail 0.2.83 through Hail 0.2.109 (released February 2023), Hail was pinned to Dataproc 2.0.44. From Hail 0.2.15 onwards, `hailctl dataproc`, by default, reserves 80% of the advertised memory of the driver node for the use of the Hail Query Driver JVM process. For example, Google advertises that an n1-highmem-8 has 52 GiB of RAM, so Hail sets the `spark:spark.driver.memory` property to `41g` (we always round down). Before aggressive memory protection, this setting was sufficient to protect the driver from starving itself of memory. Unfortunately, Hail 0.2.110 upgraded to Dataproc 2.1.2 which enabled ""memory protection"". Moreover, in the years since Hail 0.2.15, the memory in use by system processes on Dataproc driver nodes appears to have increased. Due to these two circumstances, the driver VM's memory usage can grow high enough to trigger the OOMKiller before the JVM triggers a GC. Consider, for example, these slices of the syslog of the n1-highmem-8 driver VM of a Dataproc cluster:. ```; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: earlyoom v1.6.2; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: mem total: 52223 MiB, swap total: 0 MiB; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: sending SIGTERM when mem <= 0.12% and swap <= 1.00%,; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: SIGKILL when mem <= 0.06% and swap <= 0.50%; ...; Nov 22 14:30:05 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m post-hdfs-startup-script[7747]: + echo 'All done'; Nov 22 14:30:05 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m post-hdfs-startup-script[7",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1836844790:463,release,released,463,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1836844790,1,['release'],['released']

Deployability,"OK, I've made most of the changes and I'd appreciate some feedback before I finalize the PR. Notable changes:; - The `hailctl dataproc` subcommand now has `--beta`, `--configuration=`, `--dry-run`, `--project=` and `--zone=`. These apply to all commands. There is a `GcloudRunner` object that takes these options, is set to the click context user `obj` field, and is used by all hailctl dataproc commands to invoke gcloud. Note, not all dataproc subcommands invoke gcloud, but the current design doesn't differentiate. Note, with `click`, the subcommand options must go on the subcommand, so `hailctl dataproc stop --dry-run` is an error.; - hailctl no longer takes `--region` (for gcloud dataproc commands). I compute region in `GcloudRunner` by checking dataproc/region or falling back to determining the region from the zone. I error if the region and zone are incompatible (gcloud would also do this).; - I stripped all gcloud pass through args from `hailctl dataproc modify`. There aren't any left. Invoking `modify` now looks like:. ```; hailctl dataproc modify my-cluster \; --extra-glcoud-update-args='---num-workers=2 --num-secondary-workers=100'; ```. The `extra` in the option name sounds a little weird since they are the only options (and the command isn't run if they aren't specified), but I'm leaving it for consistency for now. I moved the help text from the removed options into the help for the modify command itself. The output of `modify --help` is included below.; - I plan to leave the `--async` option to stop, although it is pass through.; - Then there is `--files` for submit. This is passed through, but `--py-files` is needed (it is not passed through, but modified). Do I leave `--files`? I'm currently inclined to.; - Finally, I need to strip out the pass through arguments for start like I did with update. ```; $ hailctl dataproc modify --help; Usage: hailctl dataproc modify [OPTIONS] CLUSTER_NAME.

Deployability,"Regarding the `pyspark` issue, it looks like you have to use `--properties-file` and then put that comma-sepearted list as a newline-separated list in a file.

This is assuming we're controlling the compiler in the packaged distribution and on the cloud, we're testing representative user pipelines against gcc and clang, so the scenario you're imagining is either a Hail developer or someone who is sophisticated enough to maintain a Spark cluster (1000x worse configuration nonsense than we're arguing about here, I promise) who is either (1) running old or obscure compiler, or (2) ran into a bug that had test coverage.

Can we avoid heavily (or even moderately) templated code? I'm already nervous long-term about the latency of the C++ compiler overhead and if I'm being honest would prefer to generate LLVM IR directly into memory. We should ship whatever compiler is best on the cloud and in the download package. That already covers a vast majority of our users.

Deployability,"This is super cool! I am a big fan of the idea and the overall approach, particularly when it comes to setting up the tmp bucket and getting the permissions on it correct. Here's my high level thoughts. Sorry for the wall of text but I found these a little hard to articulate. ### Regarding number of prompts. I think this is my primary concern. There's a lot of great automation here, but it's a lot right off the bat. I think what this is aiming to do is make it quick and simple to start running batches and every time someone has to stop and ask someone a question as to how they should respond to some prompt that process gets longer and more complicated. I think it's worth considering what the first batch people should run might be and design for a minimal first experience. IMO, a temp bucket is an absolutely crucial piece of configuration before you can do anything interesting and configuring a temp bucket is something that `hailctl` can easily be very opinionated about. Container registryâ€¦ I feel like there's harder questions there, and you can run a lot of cool batches before having to worry about provisioning your own. It's also not actually a part of the hailctl config (unless something has changed recently) so it feels a little unusual in this flow. I still think that it is helpful to set people up with an AR and keep them from footguns, but maybe that can go in a separate command that the initial init command points to once you're done? Something along the lines of ""if you get to the point where you need to upload custom container images, you can use hailctl to set up a registry""?. Another thing that gives me a little pause is the wording around google projects. I get that you need one to create a bucket, but I think we should just make sure to steer clear of the implication that you are ""selecting a GCP project to use for Hail Batch"", because that implies some link or ownership that isn't there.

Deployability,"We need to stop this because the oomkiller (a) acts before the JVM GC can free things and (b) prevents us from getting JVM diagnostics on failure. We control the JVM's max heap with hailctl's --master-memory-fraction (default is 0.8 for 80% of the master machine type's advertised RAM). I suggest we set this down to 0.6 and continue using an n1-highmem-16 driver.; If Hail is (incorrectly) accumulating garbage memory per-group, we'll have a better chance diagnosing that with a running JVM instead of one that's been SIGKILL'ed. To understand what's going on, we gotta see what is using RAM in the n1-highmem-16 case. If I could SSH to the cluster, a simple solution is a screen with top -s 300 -n 100 >memory.log (I'd guess no more than 500KiB per hour of logs) and retrieve that file if the cluster fails. If we could get Google Monitoring set up to retrieve process-level memory statistics from the driver node that should also work. Just to be clear, I don't anticipate any changes to Hail in the next week that would change the memory use of this pipeline. There could be a memory leak, but I have no clews that lead to it. I realize this is an unsatisfying answer. I'm pretty perplexed as to what could be the issue here. #### technical details.

We lack syslogs for Run B, so we cannot be certain but the lack of a JVM stack trace suggests to me that (a) the driver failed and (b) the driver was killed by the system.; Let's focus on the driver machines.

Deployability,"crossposting from a message I sent to the variants team. ---. #### executive summary. Excess JVM memory use is almost certainly not the issue. I've taken a close look at the import_gvs.py loop and the related Hail Python code. No obvious accumulation of RAM use. AFAICT, the oomkiller keeps killing the pipelines. We need to stop this because the oomkiller (a) acts before the JVM GC can free things and (b) prevents us from getting JVM diagnostics on failure. We control the JVM's max heap with hailctl's --master-memory-fraction (default is 0.8 for 80% of the master machine type's advertised RAM). I suggest we set this down to 0.6 and continue using an n1-highmem-16 driver.; If Hail is (incorrectly) accumulating garbage memory per-group, we'll have a better chance diagnosing that with a running JVM instead of one that's been SIGKILL'ed. To understand what's going on, we gotta see what is using RAM in the n1-highmem-16 case. If I could SSH to the cluster, a simple solution is a screen with top -s 300 -n 100 >memory.log (I'd guess no more than 500KiB per hour of logs) and retrieve that file if the cluster fails. If we could get Google Monitoring set up to retrieve process-level memory statistics from the driver node that should also work. Just to be clear, I don't anticipate any changes to Hail in the next week that would change the memory use of this pipeline. There could be a memory leak, but I have no clews that lead to it. I realize this is an unsatisfying answer. I'm pretty perplexed as to what could be the issue here. #### technical details. We'll call the second to most recent run Run A and the most recent run Run B. Run A (like all runs before it) only manages two sample groups before failing. Run B made it through 50 groups before failing on 51. Why did they fail? The syslog for Run A is clear: the oomkiller killed Run A. We lack syslogs for Run B, so we cannot be certain but the lack of a JVM stack trace suggests to me that (a) the driver failed and (b) the drive",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1832666449:303,pipeline,pipelines,303,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1832666449,1,['pipeline'],['pipelines']

There is a `GcloudRunner` object that takes these options, is set to the click context user `obj` field, and is used by all hailctl dataproc commands to invoke gcloud. Note, not all dataproc subcommands invoke gcloud, but the current design doesn't differentiate. Note, with `click`, the subcommand options must go on the subcommand, so `hailctl dataproc stop --dry-run` is an error.; - hailctl no longer takes `--region` (for gcloud dataproc commands).

Deployability,"ert lists. Yeah, it felt a little silly to duplicate the cert in each secret. However, this seems like the simplest approach if I require each principal to only trust a subset of incoming/outgoing principals. If I had one secret per principal, then I have to modify build.yaml or deployment.yamls if I modify the trust sets. That seemed error prone. If I had one secret with all the certs, then when a service starts up it has to select the trusted ones and only insert those into its certificate store. This seems OK, but a little harder to inspect. Duplicating a cert for each trust list to which it belongs occupies what seems like a good spot to me from a developer ergonomics perspective:; - O(trusts) modifications necessary to update/revoke the cert; - O(1) configuration to load a trust list; - no pod-start-time configuration; - the trust list is on the container's file system, so its easy to inspect. Small point: I don't pin the incoming certs yet due to the mTLS challenges. ### create on each deploy. Only creating certs if they don't exist is an easy change. Seems fine, though leaves unresolved how to rotate the certs. I guess I'm inclined to always recreate because it makes rotation the common case, forcing us to make it work well. I think the only way to do a no-downtime rotation is:; 1. create fresh certs; 2. create the trust lists including a principal's fresh cert and previous generation cert; 3. update all the secrets; 4. somehow ensure everyone has the latest secrets?; 5. notify all servers to refresh their certificates (nginx: send SIGHUP, aiohttp: we have to write something). We could stick a generation uuid in the secrets and keep refreshing services until the certificate uuid they read is the one our deploy expects. ### mTLS. This PR will land. Things will break because the unmanaged services (router-resolver, gateway, internal-gateway) do not speak TLS. I'll manually deploy them.

Sanic also uses httptools and uvloop, but has more stuff.. so yeah maybe a bit slower than Starlette, or not, but the diff will probably be small. Regarding the benchmark you linked, it is benchmarking the power of sleep. There is something deeply wrong with their results. Sanic has 1800 timeouts, vs 200 for aiohttp, and 3x the connection errors. Fine, so Sanic is super slow. But look at their non-db tests. Sanic is >2x as fast, 0 timeouts. They aren't using anything Sanic specific to query the database, and both use the same event loop. Adding asyncio Postgres to two programs that fundamentally differ mainly in how the handle http requests and responses, shows the one that is faster at http requests/responses (Sanic) becoming much slower, and in fact reversing its relationship to Aiohttp. This is strange to say the least. I was really curious about this, so I ran the bench. First, I upgraded Sanic to a recent version. Then I ran their test.

We could probably build an SSLContext shim that contained two SSLContexts one with a root cert and one with the trusted certs and require certification verification to pass both. Seems easy to get wrong, so I'm inclined to not take this path. ### trusted cert lists. Yeah, it felt a little silly to duplicate the cert in each secret. However, this seems like the simplest approach if I require each principal to only trust a subset of incoming/outgoing principals. If I had one secret per principal, then I have to modify build.yaml or deployment.yamls if I modify the trust sets. That seemed error prone. If I had one secret with all the certs, then when a service starts up it has to select the trusted ones and only insert those into its certificate store. This seems OK, but a little harder to inspect. Duplicating a cert for each trust list to which it belongs occupies what seems like a good spot to me from a developer ergonomics perspective:; - O(trusts) modifications necessary to update/revoke the cert; - O(1) configuration to load a trust list; - no pod-start-time configuration; - the trust list is on the container's file system, so its easy to inspect. Small point: I don't pin the incoming certs yet due to the mTLS challenges. ### create on each deploy. Only creating certs if they don't exist is an easy change.

I get that you need one to create a bucket, but I think we should just make sure to steer clear of the implication that you are ""selecting a GCP project to use for Hail Batch"", because that implies some link or ownership that isn't there. But I think there's a quick fix here: for a given resource that we *are* creating for hail use, like the temp bucket, ask for the name first and then ask which project it should be created in, using the projects listed in gcloud as choices with the option to write in your own. ### Regarding number of checks; I think it'd be good to avoid warnings when possible. From looking at this I see a pattern of; 1. Ask a leading question; 2. Emit a warning if the user selects the alternative option instead of the suggested option. I think I would prefer instead to ask a leading question and in the prompt explain why the alternative option might be undesirable. Then when they make a decision just move on. On a broader note, I think we should focus on having good documentation and linking to it over having perfectly thorough ; explanations in the CLI. At some point in an interactive setup if it gets longwinded I start spamming enter, but if it was quick and at the end it said something to the effect of: ""Your current configuration could result in excess cloud cost. See the documentation <here> about common pitfalls and how to avoid them"", I might decide to read through that FAQ with a more discerning eye. This is just my opinion though, I would be curious to see if other folks disagree regarding the UX.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13279#issuecomment-1648633012:2955,configurat,configuration,2955,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13279#issuecomment-1648633012,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"ogle Monitoring set up to retrieve process-level memory statistics from the driver node that should also work. Just to be clear, I don't anticipate any changes to Hail in the next week that would change the memory use of this pipeline. There could be a memory leak, but I have no clews that lead to it. I realize this is an unsatisfying answer. I'm pretty perplexed as to what could be the issue here. #### technical details. We'll call the second to most recent run Run A and the most recent run Run B. Run A (like all runs before it) only manages two sample groups before failing. Run B made it through 50 groups before failing on 51. Why did they fail? The syslog for Run A is clear: the oomkiller killed Run A. We lack syslogs for Run B, so we cannot be certain but the lack of a JVM stack trace suggests to me that (a) the driver failed and (b) the driver was killed by the system.; Let's focus on the driver machines. In Run A, we used an n1-highmem-8 which is advertised to have 52GiB (53248 MiB). In Run B, we used an n1-highmem-16 which is advertised to have 104GiB (106,496 MiB). hailctl sets the JVM max heap size to 80% of the advertised RAM, so 42598 MiB (see hailctl's --master-memory-fraction). In Run A (the only run for which we have syslogs), based on the driver's syslog, before Spark starts, the system has already allocated 8500 MiB to Linux/Google/Dataproc daemons. Moreover, the actual RAM of the system (as reported by the earlyoom daemon) is 52223 MiB (51 GiB, 1GiB less than Google advertises for n1-highmem-8). Assuming these daemons never release their memory, all our user code must fit in 43723 MiB. Since the JVM's max heap is 42598 MiB, Python (and indeed, anything else on the system) is limited to allocating 1125 MiB. I assume that an n1-highmem-16 uses the same amount of memory for system daemons, so I'd expect just over ten GiB that is used neither by system daemons nor the JVM. Assuming that's right, I can't explain why the oomkiller killed the JVM in Run B.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1832666449:2709,release,release,2709,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1832666449,1,['release'],['release']
Deployability,"om the `copy_files` build step. Because I wanted `service_base_image` to depend on `copy_files`, I had to move the whole step after `copy_files`. This is a limitation in build.yaml: a step must appear *after* steps on which it depends. I also had to move `check_services` for the same reason: it depends on `service_base_image`. File dependencies in build.yaml work like this:; 1. For runImage steps, you can only copy out-of or copy into `/io` (the reasoning is a bit complicated and somewhat historical).; 2. For buildImage steps, you can copy out-of or copy into `/`; 3. the `to` of an `output` specifies a file path in a ""filesystem"" that another step can access if it `dependsOn` the outputting step; 4. the `from` of an `input` specifies a file path in the aforementioned ""filesystem""; the filesystem contains all `outputs` from steps in the inputting step's `dependsOn` clause. We also have a `docker/Makefile` which is an emergency manual build system. I update that so that `hail_version` appears in the root of the docker context. The `service-base` uses the entire repository as its docker context, so I place hail_version at the root of the repository. I moved the `version` function from `hailtop.hailctl` into `hailtop`. It seems broadly useful and isn't specific to hailctl in anyway. Your concern about loading from pkg_resources repeated seems well-founded, so I went ahead and loaded the hail_version at package import time. This seems likely to ensure we learn about a missing hail_version file as early as possible (presumably at service start-time). This also means all hailtop installs need a hail_version file. I only found two other places that use hailtop. One of them was a completely unused Dockerfile. I deleted that (`Dockerfile.hailtop`). The other was Dockerfile.ci-test, which I updated to copy the hail_version file just like service-base. https://github.com/hail-is/hail/compare/main...danking:add-version-endpoint.

Deployability,"onsistencies (like #9587). A nitpick though... is there a better name for the click context attribute than ""obj""?. > hailctl no longer takes --region (for gcloud dataproc commands). I compute region in GcloudRunner by checking dataproc/region or falling back to determining the region from the zone. I error if the region and zone are incompatible (gcloud would also do this). If consistency with `gcloud dataproc` is desired, I think the opposite (determining zone from cluster region) would be preferable. `gcloud dataproc` commands take a `--region` argument. [`--zone` is an optional argument for `gcloud dataproc clusters create`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/dataproc/clusters/create#--zone). When a cluster's zone is needed to run `gcloud compute` commands, it can be determined using `gcloud dataproc clusters describe <cluster> --format json`. `hailctl dataproc diagnose` currently does this. I believe the only reason that we currently require a zone be provided either in gcloud configuration or on the command line is to maintain backwards compatibility. `cloudtools` and earlier versions of `hailctl` had a default value for the `--zone` option of `hailctl dataproc start` (I think it was `us-central1-b`). > I stripped all gcloud pass through args from hailctl dataproc modify.

Deployability,"ry code work:; - Add the rest of the core methods from VDS/KT to api2 (#2591 does most for KT, order_by is the only outstanding KT method that's not moved to table there. Same needs to be done for VDS, this isn't too hard); - Add the non-core methods to `hail.methods` / `hail.genetics.methods`; - some stuff here is much harder than the rest, like `filter_alleles`; - This is mostly just labor, but some require more thought than others, like moving TDT to use hail2 expr; - Support intervals in the `index_*` methods. It's possible now to join by locus, but not using the `annotateLociTable` fast path.; - Move to Python 3 so argument order is preserved; - Test the hail2 api much more rigorously than we do now (at the very least, call each parameter branch for each method!; - Typecheck the expression language. This isn't super trivial, and making a nice system to integrate our `typecheck` module and expressions will require some thoughtful design work.; - Some more organization around the package: monkey patching with `import hail.genetics` is an idea I like, but want to think about the edge cases first. ## Documentation; - Document the `index_*` methods / joins; - Translate the _Hail Overview_ tutorial; - Make new tutorials to replace the 2 expr ones we have; - Fill in docs on api2 methods (they're not all there yet); - Fill in docs on expression language (things like __mul__ on NumericExpression haven't been documented); - Write ""integrative docs"" that provide how-tos for common types of workflows. Show the power of annotate / select / group_by/aggregate, etc. ## Longer term QoL:; - Move over tests to Python as much as possible. I looked at the linear regression suite and it can be moved entirely into Python without many problems.; - Write a type parser in Python. The nested calls into the JVM for Type._from_java make the library feel extremely sluggish on teensy data.; - Integrate RV with C/C++, so we can transmit data much more efficiently between Python and Java.; - R",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/2588#issuecomment-352190554:1135,patch,patching,1135,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/2588#issuecomment-352190554,1,['patch'],['patching']

Deployability,"wever, I endeavored in this PR to additionally prevent, for example, a compromised `notebook` from masquerading as `batch`. I agree that additionally verifying that the certificate came from a single root certificate (that we, perhaps, destroy after everything is signed) would additionally prevent a malicious user from inserting their certificates into the trusted certificates list. AFAICT, python's `ssl` module has no support for this verification strategy. We could probably build an SSLContext shim that contained two SSLContexts one with a root cert and one with the trusted certs and require certification verification to pass both. Seems easy to get wrong, so I'm inclined to not take this path. ### trusted cert lists. Yeah, it felt a little silly to duplicate the cert in each secret. However, this seems like the simplest approach if I require each principal to only trust a subset of incoming/outgoing principals. If I had one secret per principal, then I have to modify build.yaml or deployment.yamls if I modify the trust sets. That seemed error prone. If I had one secret with all the certs, then when a service starts up it has to select the trusted ones and only insert those into its certificate store. This seems OK, but a little harder to inspect. Duplicating a cert for each trust list to which it belongs occupies what seems like a good spot to me from a developer ergonomics perspective:; - O(trusts) modifications necessary to update/revoke the cert; - O(1) configuration to load a trust list; - no pod-start-time configuration; - the trust list is on the container's file system, so its easy to inspect. Small point: I don't pin the incoming certs yet due to the mTLS challenges. ### create on each deploy. Only creating certs if they don't exist is an easy change. Seems fine, though leaves unresolved how to rotate the certs. I guess I'm inclined to always recreate because it makes rotation the common case, forcing us to make it work well.

Deployability,"y current rough list of things to be done before hail2 is as usable as hail1. It's still pretty long!. ## Necessary code work:; - Add the rest of the core methods from VDS/KT to api2 (#2591 does most for KT, order_by is the only outstanding KT method that's not moved to table there. Same needs to be done for VDS, this isn't too hard); - Add the non-core methods to `hail.methods` / `hail.genetics.methods`; - some stuff here is much harder than the rest, like `filter_alleles`; - This is mostly just labor, but some require more thought than others, like moving TDT to use hail2 expr; - Support intervals in the `index_*` methods. It's possible now to join by locus, but not using the `annotateLociTable` fast path.; - Move to Python 3 so argument order is preserved; - Test the hail2 api much more rigorously than we do now (at the very least, call each parameter branch for each method!; - Typecheck the expression language. This isn't super trivial, and making a nice system to integrate our `typecheck` module and expressions will require some thoughtful design work.; - Some more organization around the package: monkey patching with `import hail.genetics` is an idea I like, but want to think about the edge cases first. ## Documentation; - Document the `index_*` methods / joins; - Translate the _Hail Overview_ tutorial; - Make new tutorials to replace the 2 expr ones we have; - Fill in docs on api2 methods (they're not all there yet); - Fill in docs on expression language (things like __mul__ on NumericExpression haven't been documented); - Write ""integrative docs"" that provide how-tos for common types of workflows. Show the power of annotate / select / group_by/aggregate, etc. ## Longer term QoL:; - Move over tests to Python as much as possible. I looked at the linear regression suite and it can be moved entirely into Python without many problems.; - Write a type parser in Python.

Energy Efficiency," below needs to be ironed out. Should the number of jobs and state of the job group be recursive or specific to that job group? It's a bit weird for the billing and cancellation to be nested, but the number of jobs etc. are not. More concretely, if a child batch is running, should the parent also be running even if it has no direct child jobs that are running? Thoughts?; > ; > cc: @daniel-goldstein; > ; > ```sql; > UPDATE batches SET; > `state` = 'running',; > time_completed = NULL,; > n_jobs = n_jobs + expected_n_jobs; > WHERE id = in_batch_id;; > ; > ### FIXME FIXME what should the state be of nested job groups?; > UPDATE job_groups; > INNER JOIN (; > SELECT batch_id, job_group_id, CAST(COALESCE(SUM(n_jobs), 0) AS SIGNED) AS staged_n_jobs; > FROM job_groups_inst_coll_staging; > WHERE batch_id = in_batch_id AND update_id = in_update_id; > GROUP BY batch_id, job_group_id; > ) AS t ON job_groups.batch_id = t.batch_id AND job_groups.job_group_id = t.job_group_id; > SET `state` = 'running', time_completed = NULL, n_jobs = n_jobs + t.staged_n_jobs;; > ```. When you say ""billing and cancellation [is] nested"" do you mean that the bill for a group is the sum of the bill for all jobs directly in the group with all jobs in any descendent group?. Since we decided that groups are nested, my inclination is for everything to represent a sum total over the direct jobs and jobs within any descendant groups. From here on out ""sum total"" means exactly that. OK, so:. 1. In the UI (database should do what makes sense and is fast), the number of jobs should be the sum total *but* the pagination should page through the direct jobs.; 2. In the UI (same caveat), the total bill should be the sum total. (Including a sum of direct jobs cost seems fine if it is efficiently computable from the database).; 3. Yes, a group is running if any direct job or job within any descendant group is running (reasoning: if cancelling the group could cancel a running job, the UI needs to indicate that fact).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14170#issuecomment-1940341021:2455,efficient,efficiently,2455,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14170#issuecomment-1940341021,1,['efficient'],['efficiently']

Energy Efficiency,"00 on error. We could return a BadRequest error code with the message 'invalid spec' and then handle the MJC database call on the driver. I chose instead to have the worker to post job complete so we get the error message with the stack trace showing up in the UI as having the normal job flow seemed cleaner to me last week then special casing `schedule_job` on the driver. `post job complete` needs a job object to get the status to send back to the driver. However, a `Job` has two concrete implementations and we don't know which the bad job is because we can't get the spec. Furthermore, the `Job` class does a lot of work based on the spec right now. So I thought it was clearer to just create a new class that had the status, but nothing else. After writing this out, it's probably better to have the driver MJC upon error rather than from the worker. The code below would be more complicated. We'd have to get the traceback / error message from the response from the worker. ```python3; try:; await client_session.post(; f'http://{instance.ip_address}:5000/api/v1alpha/batches/jobs/create',; json=body,; timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=2),; ); await instance.mark_healthy(); except aiohttp.ClientResponseError as e:; await instance.mark_healthy(); if e.status == 403:; log.info(f'attempt already exists for job {id} on {instance}, aborting'); if e.status == 503:; log.info(f'job {id} cannot be scheduled because {instance} is shutting down, aborting'); raise e; except Exception:; await instance.incr_failed_request_count(); raise; ```. And the error handling would look something like this:. ```python3; try:; body = await job_config(app, record, attempt_id); except Exception:; log.exception('while making job config'); status = {; 'version': STATUS_FORMAT_VERSION,; 'worker': None,; 'batch_id': batch_id,; 'job_id': job_id,; 'attempt_id': attempt_id,; 'user': record['user'],; 'state': 'error',; 'error': traceback.format_exc(),; 'container_statuses': {k: None for k in tasks},; }. ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11391#issuecomment-1048213078:1450,schedul,scheduled,1450,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11391#issuecomment-1048213078,1,['schedul'],['scheduled']

Notice:; 1. The total memory available on the machine is less than 52 GiB (= 53,248 MiB), indeed it is a full 1025 MiB below the advertised amount.; 2. Once all the components of the Dataproc cluster have started (but before any Hail Query jobs are submitted) the total memory available is already depleted to 42760 MiB. Recall that Hail allocates 41 GiB (= 41,984 MiB) to its JVM. This leaves the Python process and all other daemons on the system only 776 MiB of excess RAM. For reference `python3 -c 'import hail'` needs 206 MiB. ---. We must address this situation. It seems safe to assume that the system daemons will use a constant 9.5 GiB of RAM. Moreover the advertised RAM amount is at least 1 GiB larger than reality. I propose:; 1. The driver memory calculation in `hailctl dataproc` should take the advertised RAM amount, subtract 10.5 GiB, and then use 90% of the remaining value. For an n1-highmem-8, that reduces our allocation from 41 GiB to 37 GiB yielding an additional 4GiB to Python and deamon memory fluctuations.; 2.

Energy Efficiency,"> I still generally find nginx and rules about trailing slashes confusing, but as far as I can tell this seems fine. What do you find confusing?. edit:; Not sure if this helps (if not, let me know, I should be able to clearly answer any questions you have):. Normal location blocks (meaning `location /path/to` with no modifiers or regex) match on prefix, which means that Nginx checks whether the specified `/path/to` exists entirely as a word in the longer url, starting from the beginning of that url (after the domain). A `location = /path/to` (with `=` modifier), is similar in that it is checked against the beginning of the url, with the change that the matched prefix must match exactly (there cannot be anything after `/path/to`). The proxy_pass rule with regard to slashes: Say I have `location /path/to/foo { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1; }`. Upon matching, Nginx will redirect the request to `127.0.0.1/path/to/foo`, because in the absence of a trailing slash, the entire url (after the domain) is appended. If the proxy_pass directive has a trailing slash, the entire matched prefix is dropped, and only the uri after the prefix is appended. Ex: if the url was `http://domain.com/path/to/foo`, the redirect would be `http://127.0.0.1/`. If the url was `http://domain.com/path/to/foo/bar` the redirect would be to `http://127.0.0.1/bar`. In this PR, when no trailing slash is provided to `https://internal.hail.is/monitoring/service`, the exact location block matches, since the inexact match block has a trailing slash, and therefore doesn't match the slash-less url (moot point anyway: if we made both the inexact and exact location blocks have no slashes, the exact one would take precedence).

Energy Efficiency,"> So I'm going to insist on the classical loop interface I described above, since it is strictly more powerful than the interfaces you've proposed. I agree that the tail-recursion interface seems like the right primitive to expose in python, on top of which we could implement convenience methods for building while/for loops if we decide it's worth it. > Giving each loop a name seems natural. Apart from the wrapping issue (the greatest existential threat our generation faces) I don't see any problem calling an outer loop from an inner loop. Also agree. This will require either adding another context of loops/continuations in the environment (valid places to jump to, and their argument types), or keeping them in the normal value context by adding a new continuation type. > Is Patrick's proposal for extra types written up anywhere?. My proposal has two main differences. In; ```; hl.loop(; lambda i, x:; hl.cond(i < 10, hl.recur(i + 1, x + i), x),; 0, 0); ```; the point that jumps back to the top of the loop is explicit, but the point that jumps out of the loop is not. I suggested making this something like; ```; hl.loop(; lambda i, x:; hl.cond(i < 10, hl.recur(i + 1, x + i), hl.break(x)),; 0, 0); ```; or, if we're giving names to loops, it might be simpler to pass the break and recur functions to the lambda:; ```; hl.loop(; lambda sum, ret, i, x:; hl.cond(i < 10, sum(i + 1, x + i), ret(x)),; 0, 0); ```. The second difference is in the typing. In this PR, the `hl.recur` expression is given the type of the entire loop. I would add a single new type `Bottom`, and give all expressions which jump (both the recur and the break expressions) the type `Bottom`. `Bottom` is the empty type, so there can be no closed expressions of type `Bottom`. In the type checker, `Bottom` is only allowed to appear in tail positions, and for `If`, we keep the rule that both branches must have the same type, so either both branches are `Bottom` or neither are.

Energy Efficiency,"> The end we're taking the max (in our favor). I'm not totally comfortable with that, e.g. a preemption happens after a job is finished, but the preemption event gets recorded first, you'll charge the user up to the preemption (max) even tho the job already finished. That doesn't seem right. So I see two options:. I intended to always take the min (user's favor) for the end time and the start time should never change but if it does I take it to be earlier in our favor. If the trigger isn't doing that then I got it wrong. Basically, the way I understood the trigger is as follows:. ```; IF OLD.end_time IS NOT NULL AND (NEW.end_time IS NULL OR NEW.end_time > OLD.end_time) THEN; SET NEW.end_time = OLD.end_time;; SET NEW.reason = OLD.reason;; END IF;; ```.

To not override the values, then we need to set the new end time and reason to the old end time and reason to avoid updating the record.

Energy Efficiency,"> Why is writing the hail table first more efficient than just directly exporting from the grouped matrixtable?. We take special care to ensure our system is as efficient as possible when reading or writing to this native format. So, it's partly a sociological thing. On the practical end of things, Hail's native formats (for Tables and Matrix Tables) are a partitioned binary format. The partitioned part means Hail can use many cores in parallel to process and write the dataset. The binary part means that Hail need not use unnecessarily large (in terms of bytes) representations of values. These three things together make writing the native formats use less time, use less memory, and be more reliable. ---. > One thing I noticed is the mt_hwe_vals variable in my code below is a MatrixTable and not a GroupedMatrixTable.

Though it is still a bit finicky in certain situations, usually when selecting/unselecting some combination of parent and child nodes (such as in gnomad.exomes).

Energy Efficiency,"Conceptually, if we're not just interested in missingness, then unboxedGT is useful only in route to nNonRefAlleles (and equal to it if we've split). E.g., the simplest way to extend regression to multi-allelic is to use nNonRefAlleles...though thinking about this further, it's upsettingly asymmetric in the case where the ref allele is the minor allele, so perhaps we should just force deliberate choice of splitting, esp if we're moving toward implementing that less painfully under the hood. Or do regression per alternate allele while maintaining multi-allelic form. (edited). We currently compute nNonRefAlleles from unboxedGT through GTPair, which allocates per genotype. For example, PCA currently requires splitting, but uses nNonRefAlleles. And IBD currently requires splitting but allocates per genotype via:; ```; def countRefs(gtIdx: Int): Int = {; val gt = Genotype.gtPair(gtIdx); indicator(gt.j == 0) + indicator(gt.k == 0); ```.

Energy Efficiency,"Currently pruning dependencies, forking NextJS to remove poly fills for older browsers, and focusing on bundle size. Investigated using Inferno.js as a lighter alternative to React. Saves ~20-30KB bundle size, and is somewhat faster. However, main Inferno dev moved to React core team, and React is focusing on the optimizations present in Inferno for 2019 (DOM: move to native events where possible), as well as introducing optimizations not found in Inferno (compile time targets: initially inlining, future maybe web assembly binaries; move rendering work to separate thread / concurrent rendering). Furthermore, React ecosystem is orders of magnitude larger, so we can save a huge amount of dev time by avoiding Inferno (N modules * time to develop bespoke module avg), and have greater likelihood of LTS. Notably, I realized that most of my bundle size was coming from inefficient bundling of Material UI and due to Apollo's insanely large graphQL bundle. Removing these now. Lastly, React is actually very efficient. jQuery is ~31.1KB minified. React is 3KB, while React DOM is 33.8KB. In 2019 React DOM will shrink. In any case, given that React is both faster than jQuery, dramatically simplifies development, and introduces development structure, 4KB cost is imo worth it.

Energy Efficiency,"I made some edits that I think helped to reduce the number of places that are aware of the notion of a default_region. It's really now just isolated to the `InstanceCollectionManager`, since that's the piece of code that's making the decision ""use the default region when the cluster is small"". I didn't quite like the pattern of retrieving a default from a `LocationMonitor` just to give it right back to the location monitor in the next line. I think this way the `LocationMonitor` API is much simpler, and we can actually remove its `default_location` method entirely as I believe it is no longer used. I can do that in a follow-up PR if you like this approach. One other thing is I wanted to articulate the distinction between the ""region CI needs its jobs in"" and the ""default region that batch will spin up workers in for small clusters"". While they are in practice the same, I found that treating them both as the ""default_region"" tied the logic around jobs for CI closely with internal Batch decisions and made it more confusing for me to reason about. I tried to separate out these two concepts so that in the future when jobs support region-specific scheduling it will be easier to excise the CI-specific code from the Batch scheduler. Another thing that I realized during this process is that Azure has regions and zones just like GCP, though they may differ slightly since we don't need to specify a zone for a VM and such. I am fine with using the term ""location"" to mean ""where we scheduled the VM, either zone or region depending on the cloud provider"", but I would also like to follow up with a sweep that makes this language more precise where possible. For example, the `possible_cloud_locations` function is really just `possible_cloud_regions`, and we could even go so far as mandating a `region` field in the global config instead of having `azure_location` and `gcp_region`, which are synonymous even though named differently.

Alternatively, I could also expect that globals now contains a reference to a new table, that contains only the column index, and value (phenotype), which seems fine. Neither of these options happens. Instead, I need to realize the array in memory on my master, which seems like a potentially bad idea.

Energy Efficiency,"Ready for another look. I had to modify the classes some to make it work, particularly for getting the `type` out of the test. Now the type is with the Test rather than the TestResult, perhaps you see a better way?. Related notes, mostly relevant to future PRs once we have some feedback and a sense of performance:. I think LogisticRegressionNullFit should be a separate class, as it plays a conceptually and practically different role. I don't want to attach vectors of length nSamples (like mu) to each LogisticRegressionFit output, even though they would speed up the score test and first iteration of fitting per variant to not recompute them for every variant. I did put some of this efficiency in the score test (only computing the extra coordinate of score and row / column of fisher per variant). df would also then go away for LogisticRegressionFit, but I'd add the diagonal of its inverse for use in Wald (see below). The model fit function would then take a LogisticRegressionNullFit to use in the first iteration. The bigger future gains will come from not computing or inverting the Fisher matrix at all in the iteration, but rather using QR magic. val sqrtW = sqrt(mu :\* (1d - mu)); val QR = qr.reduced(X(::, _) :_ sqrtW); solve QR.R \* deltaB = QR.Q.t \* (y - mu) with R upper triangular (need to wrap lapack function). for Wald: return diagonal of inverse as well, namely diagonal of inv(R)^T \* inv(R), rather than inverting fisher again. for Score, this version of this may be faster:; val sqrtW = sqrt(mu :\* (1d - mu)); val Qty0 = qr.reduced.justQ(X(::, _) :_ sqrtW).t \* ((y - mu) :/ sqrtW); val chi2 = Qty0 dot Qty0. for Firth, modify score using:; val QQ = QR.Q :\* QR.Q; val h = sum(QQ(*, ::))",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/585#issuecomment-241153168:1211,reduce,reduced,1211,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/585#issuecomment-241153168,2,['reduce'],['reduced']

Energy Efficiency,"The doc wasn't very clear about where information lived. I had imagined that the pools and the JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM) owned the information. Nit: the doc doesn't say the instance monitor monitors instances, it just monitors and handles *events*. Let me be explicit: I think the doc is wrong about the monitor doing health checking because that requires it to track the instances, which I just said should be owned by the pools and the JPIM. That didn't occur to me when we were writing the doc, my apologies. I still think the monitor should:; - route events to the right pool or to the JPIM, and; - aggregate summaries up for the web UI. ---. Let me try to be more specific in my critique:. I think of the system as three layers: the top most is the driver, the middle layer is the monitor, and the bottom layer is the pool or JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM). I don't want control flow to go down, up, and back down again. If that happens, then we can't reason about our system as separate layers, we necessarily have to think about the middle and bottom layer together. Very specifically, this flow worries me: (instance pool) create_instance -> (instance monitor) add_instance -> adjust_for_add_instance -> (instance pool) adjust_for_add_instance. We move from low to mid *back to low*. I want information to flow in one direction: either its downward information or its upward information. ---. I'm guessing you're also concerned about code organization / code duplication. I'm not that worried about this. The JPIM and the Pool are similar things and we might inevitably produce some duplication. That's OK with me. To be honest, I think a few stand-alone functions that both of them use will eliminate any code duplication. Both pools and the JPIM will have a `name_instances` and `instance_by_last_updated`. If the duplication gets hard to manage, we might pack that up into another class like InstanceCollection. I realize this means we have several monitoring loops.

Once all the components of the Dataproc cluster have started (but before any Hail Query jobs are submitted) the total memory available is already depleted to 42760 MiB. Recall that Hail allocates 41 GiB (= 41,984 MiB) to its JVM. This leaves the Python process and all other daemons on the system only 776 MiB of excess RAM. For reference `python3 -c 'import hail'` needs 206 MiB. ---. We must address this situation. It seems safe to assume that the system daemons will use a constant 9.5 GiB of RAM. Moreover the advertised RAM amount is at least 1 GiB larger than reality. I propose:; 1. The driver memory calculation in `hailctl dataproc` should take the advertised RAM amount, subtract 10.5 GiB, and then use 90% of the remaining value. For an n1-highmem-8, that reduces our allocation from 41 GiB to 37 GiB yielding an additional 4GiB to Python and deamon memory fluctuations.; 2. AoU RWB needs to review its memory settings for Spark driver nodes to ensure that the JVM is set to an appropriate maximum heap size.

Energy Efficiency,"d about the long-term health of the project. https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2902. In the second branch related to this pull request, linked above, I chose Starlette, and it is a thin abstraction, nearly identical performance, over Uvicorn + httptools, which were both written by Yury Selivanov, the asyncio person I mention above. Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 . Starlette is something like base Go performance (though 1/5-1/10th the performance of Go's fasthttp library for simple responses, and much closer for anything involving database calls). Sanic also uses httptools and uvloop, but has more stuff.. so yeah maybe a bit slower than Starlette, or not, but the diff will probably be small. Regarding the benchmark you linked, it is benchmarking the power of sleep. There is something deeply wrong with their results. Sanic has 1800 timeouts, vs 200 for aiohttp, and 3x the connection errors. Fine, so Sanic is super slow. But look at their non-db tests. Sanic is >2x as fast, 0 timeouts. They aren't using anything Sanic specific to query the database, and both use the same event loop. Adding asyncio Postgres to two programs that fundamentally differ mainly in how the handle http requests and responses, shows the one that is faster at http requests/responses (Sanic) becoming much slower, and in fact reversing its relationship to Aiohttp. This is strange to say the least. I was really curious about this, so I ran the bench. First, I upgraded Sanic to a recent version. Then I ran their test. In short, their results were not what I found. Sanic is 50% faster, and the timeouts are what you'd expect. 26 timeouts for Sanic, 45 for aiohttp. Sanic Run 1:; Running 1m test @ http://localhost:8000/db; 12 threads and 2000 con",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461259030:2934,power,power,2934,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461259030,1,['power'],['power']

Energy Efficiency,"nformation. Nit: the doc doesn't say the instance monitor monitors instances, it just monitors and handles *events*. Let me be explicit: I think the doc is wrong about the monitor doing health checking because that requires it to track the instances, which I just said should be owned by the pools and the JPIM. That didn't occur to me when we were writing the doc, my apologies. I still think the monitor should:; - route events to the right pool or to the JPIM, and; - aggregate summaries up for the web UI. ---. Let me try to be more specific in my critique:. I think of the system as three layers: the top most is the driver, the middle layer is the monitor, and the bottom layer is the pool or JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM). I don't want control flow to go down, up, and back down again. If that happens, then we can't reason about our system as separate layers, we necessarily have to think about the middle and bottom layer together. Very specifically, this flow worries me: (instance pool) create_instance -> (instance monitor) add_instance -> adjust_for_add_instance -> (instance pool) adjust_for_add_instance. We move from low to mid *back to low*. I want information to flow in one direction: either its downward information or its upward information. ---. I'm guessing you're also concerned about code organization / code duplication. I'm not that worried about this. The JPIM and the Pool are similar things and we might inevitably produce some duplication. That's OK with me. To be honest, I think a few stand-alone functions that both of them use will eliminate any code duplication. Both pools and the JPIM will have a `name_instances` and `instance_by_last_updated`. If the duplication gets hard to manage, we might pack that up into another class like InstanceCollection. I realize this means we have several monitoring loops. I'm not very worried about that. I think it's fine and it helps simplify the architecture. It avoids entangling the monitor with the pools and the JPIM.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9772#issuecomment-738515358:1169,monitor,monitor,1169,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9772#issuecomment-738515358,3,['monitor'],"['monitor', 'monitoring']"

It's possible now to join by locus, but not using the `annotateLociTable` fast path.; - Move to Python 3 so argument order is preserved; - Test the hail2 api much more rigorously than we do now (at the very least, call each parameter branch for each method!; - Typecheck the expression language. This isn't super trivial, and making a nice system to integrate our `typecheck` module and expressions will require some thoughtful design work.; - Some more organization around the package: monkey patching with `import hail.genetics` is an idea I like, but want to think about the edge cases first. ## Documentation; - Document the `index_*` methods / joins; - Translate the _Hail Overview_ tutorial; - Make new tutorials to replace the 2 expr ones we have; - Fill in docs on api2 methods (they're not all there yet); - Fill in docs on expression language (things like __mul__ on NumericExpression haven't been documented); - Write ""integrative docs"" that provide how-tos for common types of workflows. Show the power of annotate / select / group_by/aggregate, etc. ## Longer term QoL:; - Move over tests to Python as much as possible. I looked at the linear regression suite and it can be moved entirely into Python without many problems.; - Write a type parser in Python. The nested calls into the JVM for Type._from_java make the library feel extremely sluggish on teensy data.; - Integrate RV with C/C++, so we can transmit data much more efficiently between Python and Java.; - Rethink the expr language function registry, because many functions there can be implemented in terms of others in Python.; - add back in de novo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/2588#issuecomment-352190554:1650,power,power,1650,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/2588#issuecomment-352190554,2,"['efficient', 'power']","['efficiently', 'power']"

Energy Efficiency,"ogle Monitoring set up to retrieve process-level memory statistics from the driver node that should also work. Just to be clear, I don't anticipate any changes to Hail in the next week that would change the memory use of this pipeline. There could be a memory leak, but I have no clews that lead to it. I realize this is an unsatisfying answer. I'm pretty perplexed as to what could be the issue here. #### technical details. We'll call the second to most recent run Run A and the most recent run Run B. Run A (like all runs before it) only manages two sample groups before failing. Run B made it through 50 groups before failing on 51. Why did they fail? The syslog for Run A is clear: the oomkiller killed Run A. We lack syslogs for Run B, so we cannot be certain but the lack of a JVM stack trace suggests to me that (a) the driver failed and (b) the driver was killed by the system.; Let's focus on the driver machines. In Run A, we used an n1-highmem-8 which is advertised to have 52GiB (53248 MiB). In Run B, we used an n1-highmem-16 which is advertised to have 104GiB (106,496 MiB). hailctl sets the JVM max heap size to 80% of the advertised RAM, so 42598 MiB (see hailctl's --master-memory-fraction). In Run A (the only run for which we have syslogs), based on the driver's syslog, before Spark starts, the system has already allocated 8500 MiB to Linux/Google/Dataproc daemons. Moreover, the actual RAM of the system (as reported by the earlyoom daemon) is 52223 MiB (51 GiB, 1GiB less than Google advertises for n1-highmem-8). Assuming these daemons never release their memory, all our user code must fit in 43723 MiB. Since the JVM's max heap is 42598 MiB, Python (and indeed, anything else on the system) is limited to allocating 1125 MiB.

Agreed, too aggressive. > I think we should rely on k8s to pull the 5GB jupyter image in a reasonable time period. No. I'm going to be demanding about making our tools responsive with good feedback (not responsive in the sense of responsive web design, but responsive in the sense of fast). It has to be fast, and when can't be, it has to give clear feedback about what it's doing and how long it will take. We routinely see pulling a 5GB image take 1-2m. That's spin up a VM level nonsense.

Energy Efficiency,"think helped to reduce the number of places that are aware of the notion of a default_region. It's really now just isolated to the `InstanceCollectionManager`, since that's the piece of code that's making the decision ""use the default region when the cluster is small"". I didn't quite like the pattern of retrieving a default from a `LocationMonitor` just to give it right back to the location monitor in the next line. I think this way the `LocationMonitor` API is much simpler, and we can actually remove its `default_location` method entirely as I believe it is no longer used. I can do that in a follow-up PR if you like this approach. One other thing is I wanted to articulate the distinction between the ""region CI needs its jobs in"" and the ""default region that batch will spin up workers in for small clusters"". While they are in practice the same, I found that treating them both as the ""default_region"" tied the logic around jobs for CI closely with internal Batch decisions and made it more confusing for me to reason about. I tried to separate out these two concepts so that in the future when jobs support region-specific scheduling it will be easier to excise the CI-specific code from the Batch scheduler. Another thing that I realized during this process is that Azure has regions and zones just like GCP, though they may differ slightly since we don't need to specify a zone for a VM and such. I am fine with using the term ""location"" to mean ""where we scheduled the VM, either zone or region depending on the cloud provider"", but I would also like to follow up with a sweep that makes this language more precise where possible. For example, the `possible_cloud_locations` function is really just `possible_cloud_regions`, and we could even go so far as mandating a `region` field in the global config instead of having `azure_location` and `gcp_region`, which are synonymous even though named differently. It also leads me to wonder why we only schedule in a single region in Azure?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12078#issuecomment-1207095240:1160,schedul,scheduling,1160,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12078#issuecomment-1207095240,4,['schedul'],"['schedule', 'scheduled', 'scheduler', 'scheduling']"

Agreed, too aggressive. > I think we should rely on k8s to pull the 5GB jupyter image in a reasonable time period. No. I'm going to be demanding about making our tools responsive with good feedback (not responsive in the sense of responsive web design, but responsive in the sense of fast). It has to be fast, and when can't be, it has to give clear feedback about what it's doing and how long it will take. We routinely see pulling a 5GB image take 1-2m. That's spin up a VM level nonsense. Kubernetes 1.6 had an SLO to schedule 99% of pre-pulled containers within 5s on a 5K node cluster (from the plots it looks like they were closer to 2s):. > Pod startup time: 99% of pods and their containers (with pre-pulled images) start within 5s. from http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Soglxt0kAI0J:blog.kubernetes.io/2017/03/scalability-updates-in-kubernetes-1.6.html+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us.

In theory this should work with all systems based on g++5.x and; later. I made some effort to move std::string out of the interfaces between prebuilt; and dynamic code, which gives it some chance of working on systems based on; g++-4.x, but haven't tested that. I'm planning to fire up VM's either in cloud or under VirtualBox, to test this against Ubuntu-14.04,; Ubuntu-18.04, and the latest stable RHEL, which should cover most of the bases. In the interest of getting this committed, I have not made changes relating to logging and; error messages.

[The place where persistent cacheing of compiled files helps most of all is in testing,; where you really are running the exact same queries over and over again on the same; small datasets, and in many cases after making small changes which only affect a few; of the queries]. b) We may actually have some version of the locking problem even if we don't try to reuse the files -; since we have several workers on a node, and possibly a master as well, all needing to put code; into a file (or wait for someone else to populate the file) so that they can load it.

Integrability,"(i) -> O(i, i)` makes a square matrix whose diagonal is T. * `T(i) -> O(i, j)` and `T(i) -> O(j, i)` broadcast T over a matrix in the two possible directions. Now let T be a 2-tensor. * `T(i, j) -> O(i)` is the vector of row-sums of T. * `T(i, i) -> O(i)` is the diagonal of T. * `T(i, i) -> O()` is the trace of T. * `T(i, j) -> O(j, i)` is transposition. How do we represent matrix multiplication? Let T1 and T2 be 2-tensors. Then letting `T = Out(T1, T2, ""and"").map((x, y) => x * y)`, the matrix product is given by. * `T(i, j, j, k) -> O(i, k)`. In general, an index operation on T requires specifying an output tensor O (including its shape, though you can deduce that in non-broadcasting cases), a set of index variables (eg. ""i, j, k""), and an assignment of a variable to each dimension of T and O. . More abstractly, let DT and DO be the sets of dimensions of T and O. An index operation consists of a set I and two functions DT -> I <- DO, a ""cospan"". These operations compose by cospan composition, which involves a pushout (a disjoint union and a quotient). Let i: DT -> I and o: DO -> I be the two maps assigning index variables. It helps to consider some special cases (compare to the examples above):. * If i is surjective, and o is identity, this is extracting a diagonal from T. * If i is injective, and o is identity, this is a broadcast. * If i is identity, and o is surjective, this embeds T as a diagonal of a higher-dimensional output tensor. * If i is identity, and o is injective, this is a pure aggregation, summing out some dimensions of T. To make composition easy to compute, we could represent an index operation using a union-find structure for I.

In other organizations I've worked with, we maintained schema changes in a separate folder, identified by release versions (e.g., semver) and the DLLs are ordered by sequence number. This way, we had a clear history of DDLs and the order they were applied, eliminating the need for files like `estimate-current.sql`.

Maybe to handle large `MakeStream`s, and decomposing other streams into multiple methods, we could compile some streams into iterators.

Integrability,"> Ah sorry, I forgot to update the original commit message as that's not actually correct. The optimization is that we don't need to iterate through all blobs until we find the exact blob matching our path name. The list operation returns all blobs that start with the prefix of that path. If we see a blob with a different name that is a child of our path f'{path}/foo, then we know it's a directory and don't need to iterate anymore (although it could be a file as well, but in Scala we don't currently throw errors on paths that are both files and directories, so we just choose the first we see). If we see a blob that matches the path exactly, then we know it's a file and stop iterating. The only reason we need to iterate through more than one blob is if there's blobs that are like '{path}zzzzz/foo or '{path}szzzzz. We need to ignore these as they don't provide any information on whether {path} is a file or directory. This is where isChildOf is needed because we need to make sure the blob is actually a child of the path such as '{path}/file and not {path}zzzzz/file. Ah thanks, this makes more sense to me now. > The other option is to do 2 queries. One to check if it's a file and the next to check if there are any child blobs.

I don't disagree, but if you're concerned about this, I think an assert here is both in the wrong place and the wrong solution. I think for the design the IR, we should focus on (1) simple operations (this is already more complicated than I'd like), (2) that are composable, and (3) minimize special cases. By composability, I mean each IR should have a (local) contract, and each program composed from that local contract should be valid. Breaking this introduces a lot of potential bugs that can't be reasoned about locally, which is not good. The IR nodes do what they do. If you don't like what they do, we should probably find different ones. > so how could you possibly join this with another table?

Any time nPreservedFields is less than the requested keys, you could get down to 1 partition. This is a continuous issue and rejecting the extreme case doesn't actually solve the problem. I guess isSorted isn't user exposed, but this seems dangerously close to reporting a user error with an assertion. When the service comes up, hopefully not too long, we're going to want to document the IR and make it public.

Integrability,"> So I'm going to insist on the classical loop interface I described above, since it is strictly more powerful than the interfaces you've proposed.

My proposal has two main differences. In; ```; hl.loop(; lambda i, x:; hl.cond(i < 10, hl.recur(i + 1, x + i), x),; 0, 0); ```; the point that jumps back to the top of the loop is explicit, but the point that jumps out of the loop is not. I suggested making this something like; ```; hl.loop(; lambda i, x:; hl.cond(i < 10, hl.recur(i + 1, x + i), hl.break(x)),; 0, 0); ```; or, if we're giving names to loops, it might be simpler to pass the break and recur functions to the lambda:; ```; hl.loop(; lambda sum, ret, i, x:; hl.cond(i < 10, sum(i + 1, x + i), ret(x)),; 0, 0); ```. The second difference is in the typing. In this PR, the `hl.recur` expression is given the type of the entire loop. I would add a single new type `Bottom`, and give all expressions which jump (both the recur and the break expressions) the type `Bottom`. `Bottom` is the empty type, so there can be no closed expressions of type `Bottom`. In the type checker, `Bottom` is only allowed to appear in tail positions, and for `If`, we keep the rule that both branches must have the same type, so either both branches are `Bottom` or neither are.

Integrability,"> all options that are also gcloud options (such as --project)? [That] could be difficult. Yes, this is what I was thinking. `hailctl` could parse (as much as is needed) the `gcloud` options to find options (like `--project`) and modify others (like `--initialization-actions`). The latter is somewhat surprising since one expects everything after the `--` to pass through unchanged. OK, summarizing our options so far:. - hailctl has no options that are also gcloud options. gcloud options go after the `--`, and get modified as needed by hailctl (with a message).; - hailctl has no gcloud options that are simply pass through. gcloud options that are needed by hailctl commands are hailctl options (like `--project`). When a gcloud option is needed by some hailctl command, all hailctl commands take that option (when it makes sense), even if in some cases that makes them simply pass through. This fixes the inconsistency issues, but the user still needs to keep track of which gcloud options needs to be passed to hailctl and which are passed to gcloud directly. If you specify an option twice, once to hailctl and once to gcloud, we invoke gcloud with the option duplicated. Pros and cons:; - The first option has the most consistent interface.; - The first option modifies options after the --, which is surprising.; - The first option involves replication (some of) the gcloud option parsing semantics, which is annoying.; - The second option requires the user to know which gcloud options need to be passed to hailctl instead (but globally, not per-command).; - With the second option, if we want to warn (or error) on duplicate options, we're back to duplicating the gcloud option parsing logic. I think I'm coming around to the second option. > so that hailctl dataproc submit cluster -- --script-options would work. I see, so if there is only one `--` it refers to script options, and if there are two, the first one corresponds to gcloud options?

Integrability,"> validation. Checking the arguments to the `Variant` constructor and generating nice error messages. For CNV work, you want to parallelize over files and not lines within files? You need to process the each file serially?. I'm not against having an additional interface like ParseContext that you can use both for the RDD interface and for the CNV stuff. Another option might be to make `TableReader[C[_]](...): (TStruct, C[Annotation])` but you'll have to do some work to define a `C` that knows how to load itself from a file, for example. It would be useful to be able to write code that can be used with either RDDs or local collections. > For the 'annotation line' are you suggesting a general error-catching wrapper?. Yep! I'll look over your proposed interface. Letting my mind wander a little here. One of the challenges with Spark error handling is propagating errors from the workers back to the master. RDDs are naturally used functionally, so functional error handling might be a better approach. The `Try` monad is the normal way to do functional error handling in Scala. Since we have concurrency, we have multiple errors and we want to preserve them all. In addition, it would be nice if the new generalized `Try` monad tracked warnings (like VCFReport). The main thing it isn't clear how to handle is writing RDDs. You basically want a write to write out the values and return an RDD, but just with the errors and warnings, which you could transfer to the driver at the end with collect.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/462#issuecomment-233041581:92,message,messages,92,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/462#issuecomment-233041581,5,"['interface', 'message', 'wrap']","['interface', 'messages', 'wrapper']"

Integrability,"@cseed As I briefly mentioned in an email on Saturday, I moved notebook loading to a prefetched model. Data and page loading are decoupled: When one clicks on the Notebook link, routing to the page happens without waiting for data to come in from notebook-api.hail.is. If data is available, it is shown, else a loading indicator. To avoid loading screens, I call notebook-api.hail.is asynchronously immediately after a user hits app.hail.is, whether they're on the Notebook page or not. Therefore, typically a user will never see a Notebook page loading indicator, when they click from one page to Notebook (say they land on the home page: by the time they click on Notebook, the data is fetched, so no loading screen). Furthermore, web sockets keep that Notebook data up to date, again regardless of whether a user is on the Notebook page. So in all instances except when a user lands on Notebook directly, the time it takes to reach the Notebook page is << 16ms (seemingly ~3ms). A similar approach is now used for scorecard, except Scorecard will render data in the SSR phase (because I consider scorecard less important, and because most users of the web app won't need it), and will not prefetch data when on another page. However, clicking on ""Scorecard"" from another page will not cause routing to block while waiting for the https://scorecard.hail.is/json response; instead a loading indicator will be shown. In practice I find this preferable, because the GUI feels more responsive, and users get more feedback. This demonstrates the core benefit of universal rendering approaches, and how they can improve page loading times over even the leanest server-side rendered application.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5162#issuecomment-462221996:178,rout,routing,178,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5162#issuecomment-462221996,2,['rout'],['routing']

Integrability,"@cseed, details below, exec summary: a series of confusions and confusing interfaces lead to cloud tools deployment issues. The resolution is to fix the deploy script to always deploy `cloudtools` for python 2 and 3 (because *it* works with both). Users will need `python2` somewhere on their PATH, but `gsutil` will guide them through that, i.e. not our problem. There is no problem except that I cannot approve my own PR. I noticed @catoverdrive wasn't actually assigned, so it wasn't in her scorecard queue. ---. There was a bit of confusion around this recently that @catoverdrive figured out. So, `gsutil` only supports `python2`, but it's happy to search through your path for a variety of binaries with suggestive names until it finds a valid python 2.x binary. `cloudtools` itself works with any version of python (there was a recent breaking change in the release of python 3.7, which broke cloud tools [but that's been resolved in an open PR](https://github.com/Nealelab/cloudtools/pull/91/files#diff-7decff7c08c5270a32982ea34483b8cbR11)). Now, wrt PYPI, @catoverdrive discovered that the version of python you use to run `setup.py bdist_wheel` determines which version of python is deployed. This is rather confusing and, since none (or many?) of us did not know this, we accidentally uploaded a variety of [cloud tools versions on pypi, as you've noted](https://pypi.org/simple/cloudtools/). There was some earlier confusion wherein I thought we should only support `python2`, but that was a mistake on my end.

Saves ~20-30KB bundle size, and is somewhat faster. However, main Inferno dev moved to React core team, and React is focusing on the optimizations present in Inferno for 2019 (DOM: move to native events where possible), as well as introducing optimizations not found in Inferno (compile time targets: initially inlining, future maybe web assembly binaries; move rendering work to separate thread / concurrent rendering). Furthermore, React ecosystem is orders of magnitude larger, so we can save a huge amount of dev time by avoiding Inferno (N modules * time to develop bespoke module avg), and have greater likelihood of LTS. Notably, I realized that most of my bundle size was coming from inefficient bundling of Material UI and due to Apollo's insanely large graphQL bundle. Removing these now. Lastly, React is actually very efficient. jQuery is ~31.1KB minified. React is 3KB, while React DOM is 33.8KB. In 2019 React DOM will shrink.

The difficulty is how to do that conversion: `str(â€¦)` does the trick for [`pathlib.Path`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/pathlib.html#operators) and [`cloudpathlib.CloudPath`](https://cloudpathlib.drivendata.org/stable/api-reference/cloudpath/), returning the path and URL, respectively, as a string. But it looks like in theory there might be [`os.PathLike`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.PathLike) subclasses that don't define `__str__()` to produce a usable path/URL. The official conversion method appears to be [`os.fspath()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fspath), but that does not do the right thing for `cloudpath.CloudPath` â€” there it downloads the remote file and returns a local path â€” which is not at all what Hail needs.

Integrability,"Further pruned. Removed all GraphQL libraries, besides graphql-tag, which I like, because 1) simple hash-based cache: no need to walk complex graph to normalize cache, because in most cases I'm perfectly fine with not re-using cache across different queries (that may have some shared fields). Apollo does something ""smarter"", but much slower: walks a query, checks that the requested fields for a node are the same, and that the node's id is the same, as some other query. 2) no runtime validation of query shape via graphql-tag...uses simple template strings, which are free. We don't care about schema validation in the client...because the server will error when schema is invalid. This should be compile time validated instead, in this case via integration tests. Also removed react-icons... I was going to use this in place of material-design-icons, because I thought loading the full font, when I needed only a few icons, would be unnecessarily expensive. It turns out that I cannot find a library where a single icon import (react-icons or MaterialUI) is smaller than Google's entire material design font: a single font (there are several needed to cover all icons) is ~500B. A single react-icons icon is ~2KB on dev (production may be smaller due to tree shaking). Also, am opposed to CSS-in-JS: slower, worse tooling, larger.

Integrability,"Hey @illusional ! Sorry for the massive latency. OK, so, big apologies are in order, I totally lead you astray by mentioning the makefile. The Makefile *is* the source of hail version truth, but invoking the makefile inside an image build step feels wrong to me. Each step creates a layer which inflates the image sizes. Hail's images are already too big!. I took your commits and added one of my own that snags the version from the `copy_files` build step. Because I wanted `service_base_image` to depend on `copy_files`, I had to move the whole step after `copy_files`. This is a limitation in build.yaml: a step must appear *after* steps on which it depends. I also had to move `check_services` for the same reason: it depends on `service_base_image`. File dependencies in build.yaml work like this:; 1. For runImage steps, you can only copy out-of or copy into `/io` (the reasoning is a bit complicated and somewhat historical).; 2. For buildImage steps, you can copy out-of or copy into `/`; 3. the `to` of an `output` specifies a file path in a ""filesystem"" that another step can access if it `dependsOn` the outputting step; 4. the `from` of an `input` specifies a file path in the aforementioned ""filesystem""; the filesystem contains all `outputs` from steps in the inputting step's `dependsOn` clause. We also have a `docker/Makefile` which is an emergency manual build system. I update that so that `hail_version` appears in the root of the docker context. The `service-base` uses the entire repository as its docker context, so I place hail_version at the root of the repository. I moved the `version` function from `hailtop.hailctl` into `hailtop`. It seems broadly useful and isn't specific to hailctl in anyway. Your concern about loading from pkg_resources repeated seems well-founded, so I went ahead and loaded the hail_version at package import time. This seems likely to ensure we learn about a missing hail_version file as early as possible (presumably at service start-time).

Integrability,"I think tying the reset to the iterator is a mistake. First, iterator is the wrong abstraction here. Whole-stage code generation should use the aggregator/array strategy we're using in Emit to generate nothing, conditionals and loops for map, filter and flatMap, respectively. Ideally read ... do stuff ... write will generate an RDD with no per-element iterators at all. I want to make sure this picture is clear. Second, we want to vectorize in the database sense: we want to process multiple rows together in batches. Then overall structure of a stage is a loop over the batches, and and a loop within batches. Thus, the common case should not be we reset after every element, so I think it's the wrong direction to bake it in. The place where we do this should be interface points with the Spark stack which should be looked at with scorn and derision and as the organizing model. Finally, this points to an ongoing difference in our views about the meaning of context. I see context as serving two purposes (neither of which involve reset):. - First, context is a set of resources needed to process a partition that should be released when the partition is complete. For example, I'm working on GenomicsDB which needs to localize a GenomicsDB shard to a local file that needs to be cleaned up when the partition is complete. - Second, it is a way to tell an iterator where to return its value. (This is the ""current"" region business.). I'd be happy to separate these, but I don't see clean way.

Integrability,"I think we should find a time to discuss this in person if the following explanation doesn't make sense. . Right now, for small batches, we send one REST request to the server to both create the batch and create the jobs. However, if we want one REST request for an update (ideal for the query service and low latency jobs?), we have to use relative job ids because (1) we don't know the absolute start index of the jobs until we've gotten the start id of the update back from the server and (2) the job dependencies can be a mix of known job ids that have already been previously submitted in a previous creation/update. The negative job IDs are a way to deal with a mix of relative ids within an update and known, submitted job ids. We can simplify things if we require all updates make two requests to the server to (1) get the start id and establish the update and then (2) submit new jobs with all absolute job IDs. I'd have to make sure this will actually simplify things because I also ran into a bifurcation in how the job IDs are handled in `BatchBuilder.create_job()`. We currently populate the spec with a job id before we've made any requests to the server. We need to know how many total jobs there are before we can figure out the job ids because the API for creating a new update requires reserving a block of job IDs which then returns the start id.

I agree that move semantics takes getting used to, but I think it is much too integrated into modern C++ to ignore, going far beyond unique_ptr. Writing interfaces that take advantage of move semantics requires understanding rvalue-references in more detail, but for users of those move-enabled interfaces I think the guidelines are easy to teach: a variable will only be modified by moving if it is explicitly tagged with a `std::move`, so all you have to remember is ""after a `std::move(foo)`, the variable `foo` may only be assigned to or deleted."". > And then you get into a whole host of associated design decisions (I'm holding this as a unique_ptr,; but I want to pass it to a function - should I pass it as a raw pointer ? a raw reference ? a reference; to the unique_ptr ?).

Integrability,"Oof, good catch! The thing we're trying to avoid is `e^x` overflowing for large positive `x`. In double precision, the smallest `x` that overflows is 710. So to test that we handle overflow correctly, you can check `sigmoid(710) == 1.0` and `sigmoid(-710) == 0.0` (using approximate equality). Actually, after playing with this, if you just use the simple definition `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))`, then `sigmoid(-710)` does overflow, but it returns the right answer since `np.exp(710)` returns `inf`, and `1 / inf == 0.0`. But `math.exp(710)` throws an exception. `hl.exp` seems to have the numpy behavior, so I think the simple version actually works. But we should add the above test. I think wrapping this in an exposed function is a good idea. I agree it should be called `expit`, both for consistency with scipy, and because as you say, `sigmoid` really just means an S shaped function.

Integrability,"Ready for another look. I had to modify the classes some to make it work, particularly for getting the `type` out of the test. Now the type is with the Test rather than the TestResult, perhaps you see a better way?. Related notes, mostly relevant to future PRs once we have some feedback and a sense of performance:. I think LogisticRegressionNullFit should be a separate class, as it plays a conceptually and practically different role. I don't want to attach vectors of length nSamples (like mu) to each LogisticRegressionFit output, even though they would speed up the score test and first iteration of fitting per variant to not recompute them for every variant. I did put some of this efficiency in the score test (only computing the extra coordinate of score and row / column of fisher per variant). df would also then go away for LogisticRegressionFit, but I'd add the diagonal of its inverse for use in Wald (see below). The model fit function would then take a LogisticRegressionNullFit to use in the first iteration. The bigger future gains will come from not computing or inverting the Fisher matrix at all in the iteration, but rather using QR magic. val sqrtW = sqrt(mu :\* (1d - mu)); val QR = qr.reduced(X(::, _) :_ sqrtW); solve QR.R \* deltaB = QR.Q.t \* (y - mu) with R upper triangular (need to wrap lapack function). for Wald: return diagonal of inverse as well, namely diagonal of inv(R)^T \* inv(R), rather than inverting fisher again. for Score, this version of this may be faster:; val sqrtW = sqrt(mu :\* (1d - mu)); val Qty0 = qr.reduced.justQ(X(::, _) :_ sqrtW).t \* ((y - mu) :/ sqrtW); val chi2 = Qty0 dot Qty0. for Firth, modify score using:; val QQ = QR.Q :\* QR.Q; val h = sum(QQ(*, ::))",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/585#issuecomment-241153168:1314,wrap,wrap,1314,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/585#issuecomment-241153168,1,['wrap'],['wrap']

Integrability,"Some initial thoughts:; * I'm not sure we should have implicitly broadcasting operations in the IR. It seems simpler to make broadcast an explicit operation, which we make sure to deforest. In fact, broadcast is a special case of the generic tensor index operation I'll describe below. Implicitly broadcasting operations could be provided in the Python interface, making broadcasts explicit when constructing the IR.; * I'm also not sure how much special treatment we should give to block matrices in the IR. I now like to think of block matrices as just 4-tensors, with matrix operations like matrix multiplication lowering to operations on 4-tensors. If we allow tensors to have some distributed dimensions and some ""small"" dimensions, then at least in the backend we might not need special handling of block structures. It may still be helpful to have a special block matrix/tensor representation at the top level IR, or maybe that should only live in Pythonâ€”I'm not sure. Here's a proposal for a set of primitive tensor operations. * Outer product: Takes two tensors, T1 and T2, with shapes [n1, ..., ni] and [m1, ..., mj], and entry types t1 and t2, and makes a tensor Out with shape [n1, ..., ni, m1, ..., mj] and entry type (t1, t2). If we want to support sparse tensors, this should take a flag specifying how the sparse structure of the output is determined from those of the inputs. I'll call the possible flags ""and"", ""or"", and ""true"". The ""and"" flag says that Out(n, m) is defined iff T1(n) AND T2(m) are both defined. If we will be multiplying the pairs, or applying any other operation with our default missingness semantics, this is the appropriate setting.; The ""or"" flag says Out(n, m) is defined iff T1(n) OR T2(m) is defined, as is appropriate if we are adding the pairs.; ""true"" just means make Out dense, regardless of the sparsity of the inputs. * Map.

Integrability,"Thanks, @tomwhite! This is great. Is there a Hive CLI equivalent of `LIKE PARQUET <file>`? I can't figure out how to get Hive to infer the schema from the Parquet file rather than specifying it explicitly. It would be awesome to be able to query the genotypes, too. It seems like we could write a SerDe (now I'm thinking ImpEx isn't so bad :)) to unpack the genotypes. Does that sound like the right approach?. On a related note, we've played with storing VDS natively as Parquet as (variant, variant annotations, array(genotype)). Even when I ported over some of the GenotypeStream encoding tricks (OD instead of DP, etc.), it was 2-3x larger (using Snappy compression vs. our internal LZ4 compression). That's disappointing, esp. when we have 30+TB datasets on the way. What's worse, simple operations like counting genotypes (`count -g`) are 5-10x in the native representation. Current master:. ```; $ hail importvcf profile225.vcf.bgz write -o profile225.vds read -i profile225.vds count -g; hail: info: timing:; importvcf: 508.829ms; write: 3m6.7s; read: 1.629s; count: 13.934s; $ du -sh profile225.vds; 2.0G profile225.vds; ```. And with the `jg_dataframe1` experimental branch, which uses native Parquet and computes the count using a UDF that computes the sum per array (fastest Parquet-based implementation we've found so far):. ```; $ hail importvcf profile225.vcf.bgz write -o profile225.vds read2 -i profile225.vds count2; hail: info: timing:; importvcf: 492.354ms; write: 5m57.1s; read2: 1.466s; count2: 1m44.1; $ du -sh profile225.vds; 5.4G profile225.vds; ```. That's 2.7x larger and >7x slower. This includes the fact that the Parquet version is only loading the GT field of the genotypes (!). This might be a non-starter for us. We'd love the flexibility and interoperability of standard Parquet. If you have other ideas about how to get Parquet close to what we currently have, I'd love to talk more.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/480#issuecomment-234027310:1776,interoperab,interoperability,1776,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/480#issuecomment-234027310,1,['interoperab'],['interoperability']

Integrability,"The creeping expansion of the interface is on me as we tried to not break 0.1. I'd appreciate discussing in person what makes the most sense for 0.1. Here are the pieces I think we should separate for devel, though we could consider providing a meta-interface as well that combines some of them for usability. I'm writing (U, S, L) for a local matrix of eigenvectors U, an array of eigenvalues S, and an array of labels L on the rows of U (as with labels for SymmetricMatrix). 1) VDS to a (labeled) symmetric matrix (we have these: GRM, RRM, LD matrix, and Dan is working on a way to read and write them). 2) Symmetric matrix to (U, S, L), which we'll want to write and read. This modularizes the single-core eigen-decomposition bottleneck. 3) Variant-labeled (V, S, L) and VDS with those variants to transport (V, S, L) to sample-labeled (U, S, L). Currently this also requires knowing the number of samples used to make the LDMatrix since that number is used in its normalization. I agree it feels unnatural to need to remember this; to avoid it we'd need an unnormalized version. 4) Sample-labeled (U, S, L) and VDS to global fit of LMM including delta. This is currently a local computation that's been pretty fast in practice but as sample sizes increase we will want to distribute evaluating many values of delta in parallel. Note this step only uses the sample annotations on the VDS, so logically it could also be on KeyTable (which would be the sample KeyTable of the VDS). 5) Sample-labeled (U, S, L), VDS, and delta to per-variant-fit of LMM. This VDS can now contain exactly the variants one wants to fit. (5) should eventually be decomposed as well. The first command should project from Matrix to Matrix (projecting both numeric cells and a list of numeric sample annotations) and some additional small data. Then (6) will do per variant tests starting from after this projection (that is, after what is the BIG computation when you have tens of millions of variants).

Integrability,"The doc wasn't very clear about where information lived. I had imagined that the pools and the JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM) owned the information. Nit: the doc doesn't say the instance monitor monitors instances, it just monitors and handles *events*. Let me be explicit: I think the doc is wrong about the monitor doing health checking because that requires it to track the instances, which I just said should be owned by the pools and the JPIM. That didn't occur to me when we were writing the doc, my apologies. I still think the monitor should:; - route events to the right pool or to the JPIM, and; - aggregate summaries up for the web UI. ---. Let me try to be more specific in my critique:. I think of the system as three layers: the top most is the driver, the middle layer is the monitor, and the bottom layer is the pool or JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM). I don't want control flow to go down, up, and back down again. If that happens, then we can't reason about our system as separate layers, we necessarily have to think about the middle and bottom layer together. Very specifically, this flow worries me: (instance pool) create_instance -> (instance monitor) add_instance -> adjust_for_add_instance -> (instance pool) adjust_for_add_instance. We move from low to mid *back to low*. I want information to flow in one direction: either its downward information or its upward information. ---. I'm guessing you're also concerned about code organization / code duplication. I'm not that worried about this. The JPIM and the Pool are similar things and we might inevitably produce some duplication. That's OK with me. To be honest, I think a few stand-alone functions that both of them use will eliminate any code duplication. Both pools and the JPIM will have a `name_instances` and `instance_by_last_updated`. If the duplication gets hard to manage, we might pack that up into another class like InstanceCollection. I realize this means we have several monitoring loops.

Integrability,"The problem I saw was this:. ToStream's invariant is that its children must be TIterable. Given this invariant, in boundary it is not safe to call ToArray on streamified when streamified.isInstanceOf[TStream] and node.typ.isInstanceOf[TArray], because this will miss cases (potentially) when node is a different TIterable, and likewise it is not safe to call ToArray on streamified when node.typ.isInstanceOf[TIterable], because we may inadvertently cast a non-array TIterable to TArray, and thereby break boundary's type invariance. So everywhere that we add a ToStream, we need to perform a check on the child: if it's a non-TArray TIterable, return it, else wrap in ToArray, unless we can be sure we never perform said wrap on a TIterable when streamify is called from boundary. . In the latest commit, I simplified the toStream code, and improved the type check to check not TContainer, but (TIterable && !TStream). This is more precise that checking TContainer alone. That being said I haven't created a convincing test yet (though it's trivially easy to make *a* test: pass a ToStream wrapping a node with typ TDict to boundary, with the old check on boundary, and a TIterable check-before-wrap-in-ToStream in the base case of streamify).

Integrability,"Working backwards, we need to not return a 500 on error. We could return a BadRequest error code with the message 'invalid spec' and then handle the MJC database call on the driver. I chose instead to have the worker to post job complete so we get the error message with the stack trace showing up in the UI as having the normal job flow seemed cleaner to me last week then special casing `schedule_job` on the driver. `post job complete` needs a job object to get the status to send back to the driver. However, a `Job` has two concrete implementations and we don't know which the bad job is because we can't get the spec. Furthermore, the `Job` class does a lot of work based on the spec right now. So I thought it was clearer to just create a new class that had the status, but nothing else. After writing this out, it's probably better to have the driver MJC upon error rather than from the worker. The code below would be more complicated. We'd have to get the traceback / error message from the response from the worker. ```python3; try:; await client_session.post(; f'http://{instance.ip_address}:5000/api/v1alpha/batches/jobs/create',; json=body,; timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=2),; ); await instance.mark_healthy(); except aiohttp.ClientResponseError as e:; await instance.mark_healthy(); if e.status == 403:; log.info(f'attempt already exists for job {id} on {instance}, aborting'); if e.status == 503:; log.info(f'job {id} cannot be scheduled because {instance} is shutting down, aborting'); raise e; except Exception:; await instance.incr_failed_request_count(); raise; ```.

Integrability,"crossposting from a message I sent to the variants team. ---. #### executive summary. Excess JVM memory use is almost certainly not the issue. I've taken a close look at the import_gvs.py loop and the related Hail Python code. No obvious accumulation of RAM use. AFAICT, the oomkiller keeps killing the pipelines. We need to stop this because the oomkiller (a) acts before the JVM GC can free things and (b) prevents us from getting JVM diagnostics on failure. We control the JVM's max heap with hailctl's --master-memory-fraction (default is 0.8 for 80% of the master machine type's advertised RAM). I suggest we set this down to 0.6 and continue using an n1-highmem-16 driver.; If Hail is (incorrectly) accumulating garbage memory per-group, we'll have a better chance diagnosing that with a running JVM instead of one that's been SIGKILL'ed. To understand what's going on, we gotta see what is using RAM in the n1-highmem-16 case. If I could SSH to the cluster, a simple solution is a screen with top -s 300 -n 100 >memory.log (I'd guess no more than 500KiB per hour of logs) and retrieve that file if the cluster fails. If we could get Google Monitoring set up to retrieve process-level memory statistics from the driver node that should also work. Just to be clear, I don't anticipate any changes to Hail in the next week that would change the memory use of this pipeline. There could be a memory leak, but I have no clews that lead to it. I realize this is an unsatisfying answer. I'm pretty perplexed as to what could be the issue here. #### technical details. We'll call the second to most recent run Run A and the most recent run Run B. Run A (like all runs before it) only manages two sample groups before failing. Run B made it through 50 groups before failing on 51. Why did they fail? The syslog for Run A is clear: the oomkiller killed Run A. We lack syslogs for Run B, so we cannot be certain but the lack of a JVM stack trace suggests to me that (a) the driver failed and (b) the drive",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1832666449:20,message,message,20,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1832666449,1,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"it is the imperative analog of Code[Unit]. In this analogy, a function returning Code[Unit] becomes a function that takes a CodeBuilder, alternatively, a Code[Unit] can become a CodeLabel: the place to jump to run a given computation. In addition to CodeBuilder, I have a imperative implementation of EmitCode that is similar to the proposal in the dev post: IEmitCode. Under the above analog, the proposal in the dev post would become:. ```; trait IEmitCode {; def apply(missing: (CodeBuilder) => Unit, present: (CodeBuilder, PValue) => Unit): Unit; }; ```. However, I took the additional step of ""defunctionalizing"" this picture by using labels instead of functions of code, giving:. ```; case class IEmitCode(Lmissing: CodeLabel, Lpresent: CodeLabel, pc: PCode) {; ...; }; ```. In this model, the emit function will become: `Emit.emit(cb: CodeBuilder, ...): IEmitCode`. The discipline is after calling `emit`, the contents of the code builder, when executed, will jump to one of `Lmissing` or `Lpresent` (labels which are not defined yet) and the consumer can define those labels, and use the expression `pc` in the code after the `Lpresent` label only. Because obviously I haven't converted everything to the imperative style (yet), I wrote routines to convert them back and forth: `EmitCode.fromI { cb => ... }` provides a CodeBuilder and converts a resulting IEmitCode back to an EmitCode, and EmitCode.toI(cb) does the opposite. There is also `(Emit)CodeBuilder.scoped` that will run a code builder function and collect the code as a Code[Unit]. A second idea introduced in this PR is that some PType operations may only be available on a PSettable/PValue, rather than on PCode. The motivation is the canonical array ref implementation, which involves a lot of duplicate code generation. In the current setup, we can have a compound PValue, and this introduces a PCanonicalIndexableValue that has three fields: the base array address, the length and the elements addresss.

Integrability,"think helped to reduce the number of places that are aware of the notion of a default_region. It's really now just isolated to the `InstanceCollectionManager`, since that's the piece of code that's making the decision ""use the default region when the cluster is small"". I didn't quite like the pattern of retrieving a default from a `LocationMonitor` just to give it right back to the location monitor in the next line. I think this way the `LocationMonitor` API is much simpler, and we can actually remove its `default_location` method entirely as I believe it is no longer used. I can do that in a follow-up PR if you like this approach. One other thing is I wanted to articulate the distinction between the ""region CI needs its jobs in"" and the ""default region that batch will spin up workers in for small clusters"". While they are in practice the same, I found that treating them both as the ""default_region"" tied the logic around jobs for CI closely with internal Batch decisions and made it more confusing for me to reason about. I tried to separate out these two concepts so that in the future when jobs support region-specific scheduling it will be easier to excise the CI-specific code from the Batch scheduler. Another thing that I realized during this process is that Azure has regions and zones just like GCP, though they may differ slightly since we don't need to specify a zone for a VM and such. I am fine with using the term ""location"" to mean ""where we scheduled the VM, either zone or region depending on the cloud provider"", but I would also like to follow up with a sweep that makes this language more precise where possible. For example, the `possible_cloud_locations` function is really just `possible_cloud_regions`, and we could even go so far as mandating a `region` field in the global config instead of having `azure_location` and `gcp_region`, which are synonymous even though named differently. It also leads me to wonder why we only schedule in a single region in Azure?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12078#issuecomment-1207095240:1535,depend,depending,1535,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12078#issuecomment-1207095240,1,['depend'],['depending']

Modifiability," add a single new type `Bottom`, and give all expressions which jump (both the recur and the break expressions) the type `Bottom`. `Bottom` is the empty type, so there can be no closed expressions of type `Bottom`. In the type checker, `Bottom` is only allowed to appear in tail positions, and for `If`, we keep the rule that both branches must have the same type, so either both branches are `Bottom` or neither are. This keeps the semantics simple: an if statement either makes a value or it jumps away, there's no confusing mix. One nice property of this setup is that if an expression has a non-bottom type, then it is guaranteed not to jump away from itself (it may jump internally), so it is safe to method-wrap. This also make codegen very simple, and @iitalics has already implemented it! See `JoinPoint` and `JoinPoint.CallCC`. In the IR, I don't think this requires much change. If we're already adding a continuation context (as mentioned above), then `TailLoop` just needs to bind both a recur and a break continuation, where recur takes the loop variable types, and break takes the loop result type. Then `Recur` can be replaced by a `Jump` node which calls (jumps to) a continuation in context. There's also a middle ground where we make break continuations explicit in the IR, but we want to keep the scheme-like interface in python. Then the pass @cseed described for inferring where the loop exits are would just go in python instead of the emitter. > Using the stream interface seems wrong to me also. When I mentioned this, I was thinking we could reuse the region management logic from the stream emitter for loops, but I've since changed my mind. I think loops will have hard region management no matter what. > What's the type of the stream the loop turns into?

Modifiability," recipe continues but it is also passed literally to the shell*. The docs page you linked directly addresses our use case and suggests we put the command inside of a make variable (thus triggering normal backslash-newline rules rather than the special recipe line rules). > Sometimes you want to split a long line inside of single quotes, but you donâ€™t want the backslash/newline to appear in the quoted content. This is often the case when passing scripts to languages such as Perl, where extraneous backslashes inside the script can change its meaning or even be a syntax error. One simple way of handling this is to place the quoted string, or even the entire command, into a make variable then use the variable in the recipe. In this situation the newline quoting rules for makefiles will be used, and the backslash/newline will be removed.

An index operation consists of a set I and two functions DT -> I <- DO, a ""cospan"". These operations compose by cospan composition, which involves a pushout (a disjoint union and a quotient). Let i: DT -> I and o: DO -> I be the two maps assigning index variables. It helps to consider some special cases (compare to the examples above):. * If i is surjective, and o is identity, this is extracting a diagonal from T. * If i is injective, and o is identity, this is a broadcast. * If i is identity, and o is surjective, this embeds T as a diagonal of a higher-dimensional output tensor. * If i is identity, and o is injective, this is a pure aggregation, summing out some dimensions of T. To make composition easy to compute, we could represent an index operation using a union-find structure for I. In other words, an index operation consists of a union-find structure I, and two arrays of points of I, encoding the two functions above.

Modifiability,"00 on error. We could return a BadRequest error code with the message 'invalid spec' and then handle the MJC database call on the driver. I chose instead to have the worker to post job complete so we get the error message with the stack trace showing up in the UI as having the normal job flow seemed cleaner to me last week then special casing `schedule_job` on the driver. `post job complete` needs a job object to get the status to send back to the driver. However, a `Job` has two concrete implementations and we don't know which the bad job is because we can't get the spec. Furthermore, the `Job` class does a lot of work based on the spec right now. So I thought it was clearer to just create a new class that had the status, but nothing else. After writing this out, it's probably better to have the driver MJC upon error rather than from the worker. The code below would be more complicated. We'd have to get the traceback / error message from the response from the worker. ```python3; try:; await client_session.post(; f'http://{instance.ip_address}:5000/api/v1alpha/batches/jobs/create',; json=body,; timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=2),; ); await instance.mark_healthy(); except aiohttp.ClientResponseError as e:; await instance.mark_healthy(); if e.status == 403:; log.info(f'attempt already exists for job {id} on {instance}, aborting'); if e.status == 503:; log.info(f'job {id} cannot be scheduled because {instance} is shutting down, aborting'); raise e; except Exception:; await instance.incr_failed_request_count(); raise; ```.

Modifiability,"> The hailctl dataproc subcommand now has --beta, --configuration=, --dry-run, --project= and --zone=. These apply to all commands. There is a GcloudRunner object that takes these options, is set to the click context user obj field, and is used by all hailctl dataproc commands to invoke gcloud. Note, not all dataproc subcommands invoke gcloud, but the current design doesn't differentiate. Note, with click, the subcommand options must go on the subcommand, so hailctl dataproc stop --dry-run is an error. Nice. It's great that these are handled at the `hailctl dataproc` level instead of having to remember to account for them in every `hailctl dataproc` subcommand. That's going to resolve a lot of inconsistencies (like #9587). A nitpick though... is there a better name for the click context attribute than ""obj""?. > hailctl no longer takes --region (for gcloud dataproc commands). I compute region in GcloudRunner by checking dataproc/region or falling back to determining the region from the zone. I error if the region and zone are incompatible (gcloud would also do this). If consistency with `gcloud dataproc` is desired, I think the opposite (determining zone from cluster region) would be preferable. `gcloud dataproc` commands take a `--region` argument. [`--zone` is an optional argument for `gcloud dataproc clusters create`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/dataproc/clusters/create#--zone). When a cluster's zone is needed to run `gcloud compute` commands, it can be determined using `gcloud dataproc clusters describe <cluster> --format json`. `hailctl dataproc diagnose` currently does this. I believe the only reason that we currently require a zone be provided either in gcloud configuration or on the command line is to maintain backwards compatibility. `cloudtools` and earlier versions of `hailctl` had a default value for the `--zone` option of `hailctl dataproc start` (I think it was `us-central1-b`). > I stripped all gcloud pass through args from hailctl dat",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9842#issuecomment-767168393:52,config,configuration,52,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9842#issuecomment-767168393,1,['config'],['configuration']

Modifiability,"> Why is writing the hail table first more efficient than just directly exporting from the grouped matrixtable?. We take special care to ensure our system is as efficient as possible when reading or writing to this native format. So, it's partly a sociological thing. On the practical end of things, Hail's native formats (for Tables and Matrix Tables) are a partitioned binary format. The partitioned part means Hail can use many cores in parallel to process and write the dataset. The binary part means that Hail need not use unnecessarily large (in terms of bytes) representations of values. These three things together make writing the native formats use less time, use less memory, and be more reliable. ---. > One thing I noticed is the mt_hwe_vals variable in my code below is a MatrixTable and not a GroupedMatrixTable. Is this correct?. Yes, after you aggregate you get back an MT with a different column key. ---. The `entries` method converts your matrix table from a compact and efficient matrix into a ""long"" and inefficient table. I generally recommend avoiding it if you can. However, if you only have a handful of ancestries, I wouldn't expect this to be *that* bad. You can just write the MT itself:. ```python3; ancestry_table = hl.Table.from_pandas(ancestry.astype({""person_id"":str}), key='person_id'); mt = mt.annotate_cols(ancestry = ancestry_table[mt.s].ancestry); mt_hwe_vals = mt.group_cols_by(mt.ancestry).aggregate(hwe = hl.agg.hardy_weinberg_test(mt.GT)); mt_hwe_vals = mt_hwe_vals.select_rows().select_cols() # drop irrelevant row and column fields; mt_hwe_vals.write(bucket + '/hwe.ht'); ```. ---. > I tried modifying the code to what is shown below but I'm still having the same issue.

Modifiability,"After some reading, I am still not sure what exactly the difference is between dummy coding and one-hot encoding. Suppose there is a categorical variable with $n$ categories. The [referenced Stack Exchange question](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/224051/one-hot-vs-dummy-encoding-in-scikit-learn) suggests that a one-hot encoding converts the categorical variable to $n$ indicator variables (one for each category) and that a dummy coding converts the categorical variable to $n-1$ indicator variables. With these definitions, the dummy coding is the one-hot encoding without one of the indicator variables. However, from the prototype implementation in this issue, the [scikit-learn one-hot encoder documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html), and the [dummy variable Wikipedia article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics)), I get the impression that dummy coding and one-hot encoding are synonyms and that there is no real distinction.

Ah, that's a good point. I'll rewrite to use curl and the client's own certificate and I'll make sure clients trust themselves. ### root cert. I don't think it is possible in aiohttp to both verify a certificate has a valid chain from a root cert and, separately, exists in a list of trusted certificates. The effect would be that every client would trust every server because every server certificate is signed by the same root certificate. I think using a root cert is quite secure (a big improvement over our current situation!). However, I endeavored in this PR to additionally prevent, for example, a compromised `notebook` from masquerading as `batch`. I agree that additionally verifying that the certificate came from a single root certificate (that we, perhaps, destroy after everything is signed) would additionally prevent a malicious user from inserting their certificates into the trusted certificates list. AFAICT, python's `ssl` module has no support for this verification strategy. We could probably build an SSLContext shim that contained two SSLContexts one with a root cert and one with the trusted certs and require certification verification to pass both. Seems easy to get wrong, so I'm inclined to not take this path. ### trusted cert lists. Yeah, it felt a little silly to duplicate the cert in each secret. However, this seems like the simplest approach if I require each principal to only trust a subset of incoming/outgoing principals. If I had one secret per principal, then I have to modify build.yaml or deployment.yamls if I modify the trust sets. That seemed error prone.

Or do regression per alternate allele while maintaining multi-allelic form. (edited). We currently compute nNonRefAlleles from unboxedGT through GTPair, which allocates per genotype.

Modifiability,"EDIT2:. OK, so, I'm not sure when this behavior changed but Make 4.0 wants a `\` to indicate that the recipe continues on the next line *but also* passes that backslash and newline to the shell. In Make 3.81, the `\` was also required but the newline and backslash *are not passed* to the shell. In other words: in 3.81, backslash-newline is always replaced with a space and in 4.0, backslash-newline is replaced with a space *except on recipe lines in which case it is necessary to indicate the recipe continues but it is also passed literally to the shell*. The docs page you linked directly addresses our use case and suggests we put the command inside of a make variable (thus triggering normal backslash-newline rules rather than the special recipe line rules). > Sometimes you want to split a long line inside of single quotes, but you donâ€™t want the backslash/newline to appear in the quoted content. This is often the case when passing scripts to languages such as Perl, where extraneous backslashes inside the script can change its meaning or even be a syntax error. One simple way of handling this is to place the quoted string, or even the entire command, into a make variable then use the variable in the recipe. In this situation the newline quoting rules for makefiles will be used, and the backslash/newline will be removed. If we rewrite our example above using this method:; > ; > ```; > HELLO = 'hello \; > world'; > ; > all : ; @echo $(HELLO); > ```; > ; > we will get output like this:; > ; > ```; > hello world; > ```; >; > If you like, you can also use target-specific variables (see [Target-specific Variable Values](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Target_002dspecific.html)) to obtain a tighter correspondence between the variable and the recipe that uses it. It seems to me like there are not any great choices. Putting the JSON into a Make variable seems too magical and likely to confuse a newbie editing this file.

Modifiability,"I want to respond to some of your objections to unique_ptr. > If you buy into using std::unique_ptr, then everyone who writes or reads the code has to get; their head around the massively confusing and counter-intuitive concept of move semantics (a; form of assignment which modifies the source) and the somewhat bizarre terminology and syntax; used to express that in C++. I agree that move semantics takes getting used to, but I think it is much too integrated into modern C++ to ignore, going far beyond unique_ptr. Writing interfaces that take advantage of move semantics requires understanding rvalue-references in more detail, but for users of those move-enabled interfaces I think the guidelines are easy to teach: a variable will only be modified by moving if it is explicitly tagged with a `std::move`, so all you have to remember is ""after a `std::move(foo)`, the variable `foo` may only be assigned to or deleted."". > And then you get into a whole host of associated design decisions (I'm holding this as a unique_ptr,; but I want to pass it to a function - should I pass it as a raw pointer ? a raw reference ? a reference; to the unique_ptr ?). Keeping in mind the model that letting a function/class `foo` hold a `unique_ptr<Widget>` means explicitly ""`foo` owns this Widget, and is responsible for deleting it or passing ownership somewhere else"", these questions have pretty clear answers. * If a function `bar` takes a `Widget` but isn't concerned with its lifetime management, it should take its argument as a `Widget*` or `Widget&`, with the usual reasoning to choose between them. The caller owns the widget, and the lifetime of `bar` is nested inside that of its caller, so lifetime management isn't an issue.; * If `bar` takes a `Widget` and needs to take ownership, it should take its argument as a `unique_ptr<Widget>`. This serves as documentation that the function is taking over responsibility for deleting the Widget, in a way enforced by the compiler.; * A `unique_ptr<Wid",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3718#issuecomment-396669638:724,variab,variable,724,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3718#issuecomment-396669638,2,['variab'],['variable']
Modifiability,"I wanted to chime in on this briefly because I think it a good example use case and its design will influence many future methods, so it is important to get the design right. Thoughts:. - the underscore stuff is a non-starter in my opinion, and too clever by half. A lot of my feedback on your stuff is guided by the general heuristic that you should start by writing down the code you want, and then decide how to implement. You'd never want to write this _ stuff if you didn't have to. - I'm still not quite sure what tablify does (in part because the name is too clever by half and in part because it doesn't appear to always return tables). - But I think the idea of tablify is something we want, which is to convert (possibly indexed expressions) back into relational objects (Table, MatrixTable) because the latter support a wider set of operations and don't have the ""source mismatch problem"". Tim and I discussed this yesterday and we suggest the following interface:. ```; t = build_table(); .set_globals(x = 5, batch = batch); .set_rows(locus = locus, aaf = aaf); .build(); ```. and. ```; mt = build_table_matix(); .set_globals(dataset = dataset); .set_rows(locus = locus, aaf = aaf); .set_entries(GT = GT); .build(); ```. where the input expressions for each part must all come from the same source (or be compatible, e.g., constants) and the resulting (matrix) table inherits the keys from the original table.

Modifiability,"OK, I've made most of the changes and I'd appreciate some feedback before I finalize the PR. Notable changes:; - The `hailctl dataproc` subcommand now has `--beta`, `--configuration=`, `--dry-run`, `--project=` and `--zone=`. These apply to all commands. There is a `GcloudRunner` object that takes these options, is set to the click context user `obj` field, and is used by all hailctl dataproc commands to invoke gcloud. Note, not all dataproc subcommands invoke gcloud, but the current design doesn't differentiate. Note, with `click`, the subcommand options must go on the subcommand, so `hailctl dataproc stop --dry-run` is an error.; - hailctl no longer takes `--region` (for gcloud dataproc commands). I compute region in `GcloudRunner` by checking dataproc/region or falling back to determining the region from the zone. I error if the region and zone are incompatible (gcloud would also do this).; - I stripped all gcloud pass through args from `hailctl dataproc modify`. There aren't any left. Invoking `modify` now looks like:. ```; hailctl dataproc modify my-cluster \; --extra-glcoud-update-args='---num-workers=2 --num-secondary-workers=100'; ```. The `extra` in the option name sounds a little weird since they are the only options (and the command isn't run if they aren't specified), but I'm leaving it for consistency for now. I moved the help text from the removed options into the help for the modify command itself.

There's a lot of great automation here, but it's a lot right off the bat. I think what this is aiming to do is make it quick and simple to start running batches and every time someone has to stop and ask someone a question as to how they should respond to some prompt that process gets longer and more complicated. I think it's worth considering what the first batch people should run might be and design for a minimal first experience. IMO, a temp bucket is an absolutely crucial piece of configuration before you can do anything interesting and configuring a temp bucket is something that `hailctl` can easily be very opinionated about. Container registryâ€¦ I feel like there's harder questions there, and you can run a lot of cool batches before having to worry about provisioning your own. It's also not actually a part of the hailctl config (unless something has changed recently) so it feels a little unusual in this flow. I still think that it is helpful to set people up with an AR and keep them from footguns, but maybe that can go in a separate command that the initial init command points to once you're done? Something along the lines of ""if you get to the point where you need to upload custom container images, you can use hailctl to set up a registry""?. Another thing that gives me a little pause is the wording around google projects.

This is basically to flush out any edge cases that you wouldn't be hitting with a more basic/structured test that wouldn't reach the correct internal state to trigger it. . I've found that creating a simple test structure that mimics the desired end result and using the random generator to generate comparison tests (with the count set pretty high) is generally a pretty good way of sanity checking and flushing these bugs out, rather than writing specific test cases---usually if I've written a test for a specific case, I won't have missed it when coding, and if I've missed an edge case when coding, I won't think to test it.

Modifiability,"ion strategy. We could probably build an SSLContext shim that contained two SSLContexts one with a root cert and one with the trusted certs and require certification verification to pass both. Seems easy to get wrong, so I'm inclined to not take this path. ### trusted cert lists. Yeah, it felt a little silly to duplicate the cert in each secret. However, this seems like the simplest approach if I require each principal to only trust a subset of incoming/outgoing principals. If I had one secret per principal, then I have to modify build.yaml or deployment.yamls if I modify the trust sets. That seemed error prone. If I had one secret with all the certs, then when a service starts up it has to select the trusted ones and only insert those into its certificate store. This seems OK, but a little harder to inspect. Duplicating a cert for each trust list to which it belongs occupies what seems like a good spot to me from a developer ergonomics perspective:; - O(trusts) modifications necessary to update/revoke the cert; - O(1) configuration to load a trust list; - no pod-start-time configuration; - the trust list is on the container's file system, so its easy to inspect. Small point: I don't pin the incoming certs yet due to the mTLS challenges. ### create on each deploy. Only creating certs if they don't exist is an easy change. Seems fine, though leaves unresolved how to rotate the certs. I guess I'm inclined to always recreate because it makes rotation the common case, forcing us to make it work well. I think the only way to do a no-downtime rotation is:; 1. create fresh certs; 2. create the trust lists including a principal's fresh cert and previous generation cert; 3. update all the secrets; 4. somehow ensure everyone has the latest secrets?; 5. notify all servers to refresh their certificates (nginx: send SIGHUP, aiohttp: we have to write something).

From looking at this I see a pattern of; 1. Ask a leading question; 2. Emit a warning if the user selects the alternative option instead of the suggested option.

I compute region in GcloudRunner by checking dataproc/region or falling back to determining the region from the zone. I error if the region and zone are incompatible (gcloud would also do this). If consistency with `gcloud dataproc` is desired, I think the opposite (determining zone from cluster region) would be preferable. `gcloud dataproc` commands take a `--region` argument. [`--zone` is an optional argument for `gcloud dataproc clusters create`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/dataproc/clusters/create#--zone). When a cluster's zone is needed to run `gcloud compute` commands, it can be determined using `gcloud dataproc clusters describe <cluster> --format json`. `hailctl dataproc diagnose` currently does this. I believe the only reason that we currently require a zone be provided either in gcloud configuration or on the command line is to maintain backwards compatibility. `cloudtools` and earlier versions of `hailctl` had a default value for the `--zone` option of `hailctl dataproc start` (I think it was `us-central1-b`). > I stripped all gcloud pass through args from hailctl dataproc modify.

Another thing that gives me a little pause is the wording around google projects. I get that you need one to create a bucket, but I think we should just make sure to steer clear of the implication that you are ""selecting a GCP project to use for Hail Batch"", because that implies some link or ownership that isn't there. But I think there's a quick fix here: for a given resource that we *are* creating for hail use, like the temp bucket, ask for the name first and then ask which project it should be created in, using the projects listed in gcloud as choices with the option to write in you",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13279#issuecomment-1648633012:1184,config,config,1184,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13279#issuecomment-1648633012,1,['config'],['config']

It's meant to create a Regenie docker image that we could use. It's a copy of the regenie c++ repo's dockerfile, with the removal of the ENTRYPOINT /usr/local/bin/regenie, so that I could issue a command that included an executable, which is convenient to give me the ability to check that intermediate files are actually created (wc, ls) by batch, and because that seems more idiomatic for batch.

In other words: in 3.81, backslash-newline is always replaced with a space and in 4.0, backslash-newline is replaced with a space *except on recipe lines in which case it is necessary to indicate the recipe continues but it is also passed literally to the shell*. The docs page you linked directly addresses our use case and suggests we put the command inside of a make variable (thus triggering normal backslash-newline rules rather than the special recipe line rules). > Sometimes you want to split a long line inside of single quotes, but you donâ€™t want the backslash/newline to appear in the quoted content. This is often the case when passing scripts to languages such as Perl, where extraneous backslashes inside the script can change its meaning or even be a syntax error. One simple way of handling this is to place the quoted string, or even the entire command, into a make variable then use the variable in the recipe. In this situation the newline quoting rules for makefiles will be used, and the backslash/newline will be removed.

It seems to me like there are not any great choices. Putting the JSON into a Make variable seems too magical and likely to confuse a newbie editing this file.

Modifiability,"think helped to reduce the number of places that are aware of the notion of a default_region. It's really now just isolated to the `InstanceCollectionManager`, since that's the piece of code that's making the decision ""use the default region when the cluster is small"". I didn't quite like the pattern of retrieving a default from a `LocationMonitor` just to give it right back to the location monitor in the next line. I think this way the `LocationMonitor` API is much simpler, and we can actually remove its `default_location` method entirely as I believe it is no longer used. I can do that in a follow-up PR if you like this approach. One other thing is I wanted to articulate the distinction between the ""region CI needs its jobs in"" and the ""default region that batch will spin up workers in for small clusters"". While they are in practice the same, I found that treating them both as the ""default_region"" tied the logic around jobs for CI closely with internal Batch decisions and made it more confusing for me to reason about. I tried to separate out these two concepts so that in the future when jobs support region-specific scheduling it will be easier to excise the CI-specific code from the Batch scheduler. Another thing that I realized during this process is that Azure has regions and zones just like GCP, though they may differ slightly since we don't need to specify a zone for a VM and such. I am fine with using the term ""location"" to mean ""where we scheduled the VM, either zone or region depending on the cloud provider"", but I would also like to follow up with a sweep that makes this language more precise where possible. For example, the `possible_cloud_locations` function is really just `possible_cloud_regions`, and we could even go so far as mandating a `region` field in the global config instead of having `azure_location` and `gcp_region`, which are synonymous even though named differently. It also leads me to wonder why we only schedule in a single region in Azure?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12078#issuecomment-1207095240:1837,config,config,1837,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12078#issuecomment-1207095240,1,['config'],['config']

Modifiability,"wasn't very clear about where information lived. I had imagined that the pools and the JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM) owned the information. Nit: the doc doesn't say the instance monitor monitors instances, it just monitors and handles *events*. Let me be explicit: I think the doc is wrong about the monitor doing health checking because that requires it to track the instances, which I just said should be owned by the pools and the JPIM. That didn't occur to me when we were writing the doc, my apologies. I still think the monitor should:; - route events to the right pool or to the JPIM, and; - aggregate summaries up for the web UI. ---. Let me try to be more specific in my critique:. I think of the system as three layers: the top most is the driver, the middle layer is the monitor, and the bottom layer is the pool or JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM). I don't want control flow to go down, up, and back down again. If that happens, then we can't reason about our system as separate layers, we necessarily have to think about the middle and bottom layer together. Very specifically, this flow worries me: (instance pool) create_instance -> (instance monitor) add_instance -> adjust_for_add_instance -> (instance pool) adjust_for_add_instance. We move from low to mid *back to low*. I want information to flow in one direction: either its downward information or its upward information. ---. I'm guessing you're also concerned about code organization / code duplication. I'm not that worried about this. The JPIM and the Pool are similar things and we might inevitably produce some duplication. That's OK with me. To be honest, I think a few stand-alone functions that both of them use will eliminate any code duplication. Both pools and the JPIM will have a `name_instances` and `instance_by_last_updated`. If the duplication gets hard to manage, we might pack that up into another class like InstanceCollection. I realize this means we have several monitoring loops.

Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 . Starlette is something like base Go performance (though 1/5-1/10th the performance of Go's fasthttp library for simple responses, and much closer for anything involving database calls). Sanic also uses httptools and uvloop, but has more stuff.. so yeah maybe a bit slower than Starlette, or not, but the diff will probably be small. Regarding the benchmark you linked, it is benchmarking the power of sleep. There is something deeply wrong with their results.

The original motivation for considering aiohttp: ; https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking. In short, one of the creators of asyncio discusses uvloop performance relative to other libraries. They key is:.

""I donâ€™t think performance matter. I think asgi does not matter in 2018 in general. Usability and complexity matters.

Performance," directly to your last comment. > We have a difference of opinion about the risks. I think I'd say we have a difference of opinion about the importance of the risks. I'm well aware of the potential pitfalls you list there, and more. I just don't think they're a very big deal. I'm also aware of a shit ton of things that are vastly more important than what we're arguing about and we're not talking about those. Let's talk about goals for the project and the landscape of technical risk in our next 1:1. This is assuming we're controlling the compiler in the packaged distribution and on the cloud, we're testing representative user pipelines against gcc and clang, so the scenario you're imagining is either a Hail developer or someone who is sophisticated enough to maintain a Spark cluster (1000x worse configuration nonsense than we're arguing about here, I promise) who is either (1) running old or obscure compiler, or (2) ran into a bug that had test coverage. You're worrying about (1)? What's the worst that will happen, seriously? We'll get a bug report? Let's make sure the compiler version is in the log. > A couple of years ago; > g++ take 40-60 seconds to compile; > fairly heavily templated cod. Can we avoid heavily (or even moderately) templated code? I'm already nervous long-term about the latency of the C++ compiler overhead and if I'm being honest would prefer to generate LLVM IR directly into memory. We should ship whatever compiler is best on the cloud and in the download package. That already covers a vast majority of our users. If clang is the clear winner, we can make that clear in the documentation and maybe warn about gcc it on startup. > But that becomes a problem in itself if we want the shipped compiler to work on a variety of OS'es. Variety isn't a requirement. We don't need to make this hard for ourselves. Let's have two versions: OSX and a recent linux.

Performance," image that was previously associated with it. That image is still in the registry though. I thought that was sufficient for the cache to work. (I was wrong, see below!). AFAICT, this change doesn't prevent PR tests from pushing to the `cache` tag. This change just makes the tests run by the CI-in-the-PR not overwrite the cache. Every image build for a PR (which is tested by default namespace CI) will still overwrite the cache tag. AFAICT, this; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo; ```; Will use as a cache source the `latest` tag in the `gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo` repository. It is *not* sufficient for an image to be present in the repository and untagged or with a different tag from `latest`. In particular, every push to the `cache` tag prevents us from using other images even though they are in the registry! For example, I pushed two images to `cache`:. ```; (base) # gcloud container images list-tags gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest; DIGEST TAGS TIMESTAMP; fb551d9bdb94 2022-06-10T14:16:39; afb4c5ad2d7b cache,latest 2022-06-10T14:15:55; ```. If I rebuild [1] the most recently pushed image with; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest:cache; ```; it succeeds in getting the cache. If I rebuild the other image with the same import-cache, it does not see that the (untagged) image is already there! . ---. This all suggests that all our attempts at image caching are failing terribly. Options:; 1. Only deploy builds push to a `:cache` tag, everyone uses that tag.; 2.

Performance," this:; 1. For runImage steps, you can only copy out-of or copy into `/io` (the reasoning is a bit complicated and somewhat historical).; 2. For buildImage steps, you can copy out-of or copy into `/`; 3. the `to` of an `output` specifies a file path in a ""filesystem"" that another step can access if it `dependsOn` the outputting step; 4. the `from` of an `input` specifies a file path in the aforementioned ""filesystem""; the filesystem contains all `outputs` from steps in the inputting step's `dependsOn` clause. We also have a `docker/Makefile` which is an emergency manual build system. I update that so that `hail_version` appears in the root of the docker context. The `service-base` uses the entire repository as its docker context, so I place hail_version at the root of the repository. I moved the `version` function from `hailtop.hailctl` into `hailtop`. It seems broadly useful and isn't specific to hailctl in anyway. Your concern about loading from pkg_resources repeated seems well-founded, so I went ahead and loaded the hail_version at package import time. This seems likely to ensure we learn about a missing hail_version file as early as possible (presumably at service start-time). This also means all hailtop installs need a hail_version file. I only found two other places that use hailtop. One of them was a completely unused Dockerfile. I deleted that (`Dockerfile.hailtop`). The other was Dockerfile.ci-test, which I updated to copy the hail_version file just like service-base. https://github.com/hail-is/hail/compare/main...danking:add-version-endpoint.

Performance,". The original motivation for considering aiohttp: ; https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking. In short, one of the creators of asyncio discusses uvloop performance relative to other libraries. They key is:.

As an aside I've spent some time reading about this over the last ~month, and besides relatively consistent messaging about the messiness of Python's ecosystem, performance and user experience are deeply important to me, so when I read things like:. ""I donâ€™t think performance matter. I think asgi does not matter in 2018 in general. Usability and complexity matters. Python is not very good choice for high performance system in any case...For me high performance python is a fantasy, but i donâ€™t do aiohttp/python anymore. In the end it is up to @asvetlov"". from one of the creators of aiohttp, I'm not encouraged about the long-term health of the project. https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2902. In the second branch related to this pull request, linked above, I chose Starlette, and it is a thin abstraction, nearly identical performance, over Uvicorn + httptools, which were both written by Yury Selivanov, the asyncio person I mention above. Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 .

Performance,"/hail-vdc/foo` repository. It is *not* sufficient for an image to be present in the repository and untagged or with a different tag from `latest`. In particular, every push to the `cache` tag prevents us from using other images even though they are in the registry! For example, I pushed two images to `cache`:. ```; (base) # gcloud container images list-tags gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest; DIGEST TAGS TIMESTAMP; fb551d9bdb94 2022-06-10T14:16:39; afb4c5ad2d7b cache,latest 2022-06-10T14:15:55; ```. If I rebuild [1] the most recently pushed image with; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest:cache; ```; it succeeds in getting the cache. If I rebuild the other image with the same import-cache, it does not see that the (untagged) image is already there! . ---. This all suggests that all our attempts at image caching are failing terribly. Options:; 1. Only deploy builds push to a `:cache` tag, everyone uses that tag.; 2. List all the tags in the repository and include them all as --cache-from's (this doesn't actually work: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34715#issuecomment-425933774); 3. Push a tag for each git SHA and then include as --cache-from's the last ten git SHAs on this branch, the most recent common commit with main (i.e. `git merge-base origin/main this-branch`), maybe the current main, and maybe the PR number?; 4. Write our own OCI image builder so we can write our own OCI image cache that actually works the way it ought to (everything in the registry is considered fair game for the cache). It seems like 3 is actually a decent solution that should enable lots of caching.; 1. The last ten SHAs on the branch should speed up repeated builds when you're fixing little bugs.; 2. The most recent common commit with main should avoid rebuilds unless the packages changed.; 3. I suspect the current main is actually not helpful (either 2 will work or 3 wouldn't help).; 4.

Performance,"1. I really don't understand what this code is trying to do. Can you give me a short explanation in English?. 2. I think you just need single-use Let forwarding to optimize this. It looks like:. Push down the TableCount. (TableCount (Paralellelize ...)) should turn into (ArrayLen (GetField rows ...)). Push the ArrayLen/GetField into the Let. (Is this what your ""MaximizeLets"" is doing? I think that would traditionally be called let lifting.). Now you have (Let __cols_and_globals (ArrayLen (GetField __cols (Ref __cols_and_globals))). Then you forward the single-use Let, and the rest of the code simplifies into (ArrayLen (TableCollect (TableRead ""cols""))), and that should have the static number of rows and be able to be simplified. 3. So how should single-use Let forwarding work? You need two things: to determine there is only one use, and that the single use isn't in a more expensive context, e.g. you don't want to forward a single-use Let into a loop: (Let expensive X (ArrayMap a x <use expensive once>)). Since our control flow is structured, there is a static notion of ""loop nesting depth"", e.g. in the above code, the Let has nesting depth 0, and the use in the ArrayMap body has nesting depth 1. You can only forward into the same nesting depth. 4. Final question is, do you want the let forwarding pass to also delete unused Lets? If you delete a let, that might delete references that make other lets single (or zero) use. In this case, it might be nice to build a ""use-def chain"" data structure, that keeps, for each let, its list of uses (and vice versa). Then, when you delete a Let, you can dynamically delete the references for the right hand side, possibly creating additional optimization opportunities.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5041#issuecomment-452863737:164,optimiz,optimize,164,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5041#issuecomment-452863737,2,['optimiz'],"['optimization', 'optimize']"

Performance,"=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo; ```; Will use as a cache source the `latest` tag in the `gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo` repository. It is *not* sufficient for an image to be present in the repository and untagged or with a different tag from `latest`. In particular, every push to the `cache` tag prevents us from using other images even though they are in the registry! For example, I pushed two images to `cache`:. ```; (base) # gcloud container images list-tags gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest; DIGEST TAGS TIMESTAMP; fb551d9bdb94 2022-06-10T14:16:39; afb4c5ad2d7b cache,latest 2022-06-10T14:15:55; ```. If I rebuild [1] the most recently pushed image with; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest:cache; ```; it succeeds in getting the cache. If I rebuild the other image with the same import-cache, it does not see that the (untagged) image is already there! . ---. This all suggests that all our attempts at image caching are failing terribly. Options:; 1. Only deploy builds push to a `:cache` tag, everyone uses that tag.; 2. List all the tags in the repository and include them all as --cache-from's (this doesn't actually work: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34715#issuecomment-425933774); 3. Push a tag for each git SHA and then include as --cache-from's the last ten git SHAs on this branch, the most recent common commit with main (i.e. `git merge-base origin/main this-branch`), maybe the current main, and maybe the PR number?; 4. Write our own OCI image builder so we can write our own OCI image cache that actually works the way it ought to (everything in the registry is considered fair game for the cache). It seems like 3 is actually a decent solution that should enable lots of caching.; 1. The last ten SHAs on the branch should speed up repeated builds when you're fixing little bugs.; 2. The most recent common commit with main should avoid rebuilds unless the packages changed.; 3.

Performance,"> > I think I'm seeing more where this approach is coming from, specifically we put batches as they exist today in a special category of having no updates and avoid the new code path in that case. An alternative which pairs with my above suggestion of not adding new staging tables is that all batches have at least 1 update. I feel like if we can force all batches down the new code path we'll be incentivized to make it really low overhead for batches that only submit jobs once, and that will benefit all batches, as well as simplifying the mental model. I may be wrong that we can do this with minimal performance tradeoff, but I'd like to try it first.; > ; > Can you elaborate more? I'm not sure which code paths you are referring to.

In general, I don't know how to wrap pieces of a stream in methods, since streams need to be able to jump between labels defined by different stream nodes. Maybe to handle large `MakeStream`s, and decomposing other streams into multiple methods, we could compile some streams into iterators. That shouldn't be hard to do, and would let us experiment with the performance effects. (I've been nervous about stream code never getting jit compiled, and never considered this option. I think I like it.). > Also, ToArray(MakeStream(...)) seems seems like it will be less efficient since it switches of the index while MakeArray inlines the array construction.

Performance,"> Ah sorry, I forgot to update the original commit message as that's not actually correct. The optimization is that we don't need to iterate through all blobs until we find the exact blob matching our path name. The list operation returns all blobs that start with the prefix of that path. If we see a blob with a different name that is a child of our path f'{path}/foo, then we know it's a directory and don't need to iterate anymore (although it could be a file as well, but in Scala we don't currently throw errors on paths that are both files and directories, so we just choose the first we see). If we see a blob that matches the path exactly, then we know it's a file and stop iterating. The only reason we need to iterate through more than one blob is if there's blobs that are like '{path}zzzzz/foo or '{path}szzzzz. We need to ignore these as they don't provide any information on whether {path} is a file or directory. This is where isChildOf is needed because we need to make sure the blob is actually a child of the path such as '{path}/file and not {path}zzzzz/file.

A 2nd question: how would a contributor submit write hybrid hail query/batch code that called batch from within a hail query script? So hail transforms data, say generates pc's, writes table, and then issues some batch commands that use a pre-built image, as opposed to requiring them to containerise their hail cod3. This will be useful: containerisation is the stated biggest pain point of batch, from my interviews. And one of the biggest hail issues is shuttling data between hail and other processes, which has led people to ask for tighter integration, or more statistical tools (so that they don't need to go out to those other tools, like plink). Showing Batch working from within hail-query scripts would be useful because it will show a much easier integration, and those examples or contributed modules should live somewhere (and that seems not to be hailtop, because this requires batch to be called from code that is calling hail directly, rather than through an image).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9194#issuecomment-671459432:235,perform,performs,235,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9194#issuecomment-671459432,1,['perform'],['performs']

Performance,"> The thinking behind this is that there's a huge amount of re-use of code for an individual from one Hail analysis to the next. So I'm not sure I buy this. Hail is a exploratory data analysis platform, it isn't a SQL engine running nightly billing reports. In particular, as we do whole stage optimization and code generation. It isn't clear to me how you do code-reuse when we're specializing each operation into the global context (happy to hear the plan). For example, tables that have many fields, you will need to load different ones for different queries and in general it is infeasible (exponential) to generate them all. Also, to get sharing you need to break the code up and now you're running the compiler multiple times which also seems bad. Given our focus on large-scale analysis, introducing optimization boundaries for code reuse seems like a bad trade off to me. A significant amount of analysis happens in the cloud where $HOME is ephemeral so you won't get savings between sessions. Finally, there are pipelines that are more standardized but it is my impression they are run on extremely large datasets (hours, overnight) in which case compilation speed isn't important. Finally, there's the complexity around locking that isn't easy and have real technical risk. A compiler cache potentially becomes more appealing in the context of an always-on service. There's no locking issue, and you can start to do things like speculative compilation (e.g. immediately start compiling the decoder (the full decoder? Hmm.) when a user opens the dataset.). I would say getting in a 3x decoder improvement is way more important than this.

Performance,"@cseed As I briefly mentioned in an email on Saturday, I moved notebook loading to a prefetched model. Data and page loading are decoupled: When one clicks on the Notebook link, routing to the page happens without waiting for data to come in from notebook-api.hail.is. If data is available, it is shown, else a loading indicator. To avoid loading screens, I call notebook-api.hail.is asynchronously immediately after a user hits app.hail.is, whether they're on the Notebook page or not. Therefore, typically a user will never see a Notebook page loading indicator, when they click from one page to Notebook (say they land on the home page: by the time they click on Notebook, the data is fetched, so no loading screen). Furthermore, web sockets keep that Notebook data up to date, again regardless of whether a user is on the Notebook page. So in all instances except when a user lands on Notebook directly, the time it takes to reach the Notebook page is << 16ms (seemingly ~3ms). A similar approach is now used for scorecard, except Scorecard will render data in the SSR phase (because I consider scorecard less important, and because most users of the web app won't need it), and will not prefetch data when on another page. However, clicking on ""Scorecard"" from another page will not cause routing to block while waiting for the https://scorecard.hail.is/json response; instead a loading indicator will be shown. In practice I find this preferable, because the GUI feels more responsive, and users get more feedback. This demonstrates the core benefit of universal rendering approaches, and how they can improve page loading times over even the leanest server-side rendered application.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5162#issuecomment-462221996:72,load,loading,72,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5162#issuecomment-462221996,8,['load'],['loading']

To start the gateway: `cd packages/hail-api-gateway && nodemon index.js`. Dev mode routing is slow. To see a production, minified build: `cd packages/public && npm run build && npm run prod-test`.; * Build is a kind of compilation process. Dev dependencies are pruned, the app is split into static bundles, and minified. Some optimizations, like inlining of some React functions also occurs. This is independent of anything V8 does . This will also show a neat readout of all bundles:; ```; Browser assets sizes after gzip:. 2.79 kB .next/static/gZEz****/pages/_app.js; 2.42 kB .next/static/gZEz****/pages/_error.js; 502 B .next/static/gZEz****/pages/auth0callback.js; 349 B .next/static/gZEz****/pages/index.js; 745 B .next/static/gZEz****/pages/notebook.js; 856 B .next/static/gZEz****/pages/scorecard.js; 243 B .next/static/gZEz****/pages/tutorial.js; 99.4 kB .next/static/chunks/commons.294f****.js; 101 B .next/static/chunks/styles.9f25****.js; 450 B .next/static/css/commons.b770adbe.chunk.css; 5.74 kB .next/static/css/styles.4f393762.chunk.css; 6.93 kB .next/static/runtime/main-76ed****.js; 737 B .next/static/runtime/webpack-8917****.js; ```.

Performance,"@jjfarrell Thanks for sharing that! This is really interesting information. I'm quite surprised, but the evidence is pointing to there being a PC that largely separates those 8 replicates from the entire remaining dataset (!!!). I'm personally quite surprised that 8 samples out of thousands could pull this off, but that definitely seems to be the issue, given that the PCs from PC-AiR avoid the issue. Thank you so much for hunting this down! It's very valuable information for us. ### Next Steps . So, clearly we need a solution for users that have substantial numbers of related individuals in their source dataset (especially if the pedigrees are unknown). For your _particular_ use case, I can add a blurb to the docs that recommends removing known replicates _before_ PCA and then projecting them using the loadings from PCA. A longer term solution is to simply implement PC-AiR in hail. I skimmed the implementation section of the paper earlier this week and it looks very straightforward. It seems to boil down to using the KING estimator to estimate relatedness, compute PCA on unrelated individuals, project related individuals into unrelated PC space. Finally, we can use pc_relate to improve on our original estimates of relatedness from KING. The timeline for the latter thing is kind of unclear and a bit further out given some other work I need to finish. I'll get the documentation improvement in this week.

Performance,"Ah, I understand. You're correct that pushing to the `cache` tag disassociates that tag with any image that was previously associated with it. That image is still in the registry though. I thought that was sufficient for the cache to work. (I was wrong, see below!). AFAICT, this change doesn't prevent PR tests from pushing to the `cache` tag. This change just makes the tests run by the CI-in-the-PR not overwrite the cache. Every image build for a PR (which is tested by default namespace CI) will still overwrite the cache tag. AFAICT, this; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo; ```; Will use as a cache source the `latest` tag in the `gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo` repository. It is *not* sufficient for an image to be present in the repository and untagged or with a different tag from `latest`. In particular, every push to the `cache` tag prevents us from using other images even though they are in the registry! For example, I pushed two images to `cache`:. ```; (base) # gcloud container images list-tags gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest; DIGEST TAGS TIMESTAMP; fb551d9bdb94 2022-06-10T14:16:39; afb4c5ad2d7b cache,latest 2022-06-10T14:15:55; ```.

If I rebuild the other image with the same import-cache, it does not see that the (untagged) image is already there! . ---.

Performance,"Currently pruning dependencies, forking NextJS to remove poly fills for older browsers, and focusing on bundle size. Investigated using Inferno.js as a lighter alternative to React. Saves ~20-30KB bundle size, and is somewhat faster. However, main Inferno dev moved to React core team, and React is focusing on the optimizations present in Inferno for 2019 (DOM: move to native events where possible), as well as introducing optimizations not found in Inferno (compile time targets: initially inlining, future maybe web assembly binaries; move rendering work to separate thread / concurrent rendering). Furthermore, React ecosystem is orders of magnitude larger, so we can save a huge amount of dev time by avoiding Inferno (N modules * time to develop bespoke module avg), and have greater likelihood of LTS. Notably, I realized that most of my bundle size was coming from inefficient bundling of Material UI and due to Apollo's insanely large graphQL bundle. Removing these now. Lastly, React is actually very efficient. jQuery is ~31.1KB minified. React is 3KB, while React DOM is 33.8KB. In 2019 React DOM will shrink. In any case, given that React is both faster than jQuery, dramatically simplifies development, and introduces development structure, 4KB cost is imo worth it.

Performance,"Further pruned. Removed all GraphQL libraries, besides graphql-tag, which I like, because 1) simple hash-based cache: no need to walk complex graph to normalize cache, because in most cases I'm perfectly fine with not re-using cache across different queries (that may have some shared fields). Apollo does something ""smarter"", but much slower: walks a query, checks that the requested fields for a node are the same, and that the node's id is the same, as some other query. 2) no runtime validation of query shape via graphql-tag...uses simple template strings, which are free. We don't care about schema validation in the client...because the server will error when schema is invalid. This should be compile time validated instead, in this case via integration tests. Also removed react-icons... I was going to use this in place of material-design-icons, because I thought loading the full font, when I needed only a few icons, would be unnecessarily expensive. It turns out that I cannot find a library where a single icon import (react-icons or MaterialUI) is smaller than Google's entire material design font: a single font (there are several needed to cover all icons) is ~500B. A single react-icons icon is ~2KB on dev (production may be smaller due to tree shaking). Also, am opposed to CSS-in-JS: slower, worse tooling, larger. Benefits are dynamic selectors, which are really no advantage that I can see (without them can still dynamically apply classes, as in the yee ol days of pleb vanilla js).

Performance,"Hey @illusional ! Sorry for the massive latency. OK, so, big apologies are in order, I totally lead you astray by mentioning the makefile. The Makefile *is* the source of hail version truth, but invoking the makefile inside an image build step feels wrong to me. Each step creates a layer which inflates the image sizes. Hail's images are already too big!. I took your commits and added one of my own that snags the version from the `copy_files` build step. Because I wanted `service_base_image` to depend on `copy_files`, I had to move the whole step after `copy_files`. This is a limitation in build.yaml: a step must appear *after* steps on which it depends. I also had to move `check_services` for the same reason: it depends on `service_base_image`. File dependencies in build.yaml work like this:; 1. For runImage steps, you can only copy out-of or copy into `/io` (the reasoning is a bit complicated and somewhat historical).; 2. For buildImage steps, you can copy out-of or copy into `/`; 3. the `to` of an `output` specifies a file path in a ""filesystem"" that another step can access if it `dependsOn` the outputting step; 4. the `from` of an `input` specifies a file path in the aforementioned ""filesystem""; the filesystem contains all `outputs` from steps in the inputting step's `dependsOn` clause. We also have a `docker/Makefile` which is an emergency manual build system. I update that so that `hail_version` appears in the root of the docker context. The `service-base` uses the entire repository as its docker context, so I place hail_version at the root of the repository. I moved the `version` function from `hailtop.hailctl` into `hailtop`. It seems broadly useful and isn't specific to hailctl in anyway. Your concern about loading from pkg_resources repeated seems well-founded, so I went ahead and loaded the hail_version at package import time. This seems likely to ensure we learn about a missing hail_version file as early as possible (presumably at service start-time).

Performance,"Hi @danking, thanks for this. On the topic of asserts, there are really two interacting issues:. 1. Asserts are intended to ensure invariants, i.e. conditions that should always be true. In correct code, assertions should never raise so disabling them should have no consequences at runtime. In practice, however, they are often casually used to catch value errors, which can be expected to occur if a user-facing method receives bad/nonsensical inputs (e.g. here: https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/1940547d35ddddb084ad52684e36153c1e03a331/hail/python/hailtop/hailctl/dataproc/diagnose.py#L62); 2. Python's language design allows anyone calling your code to disable asserts for optimization purposes, because disabling asserts should never change the semantics of the program. Putting these two features together, you can arrive at a situation where a user thinks they're turning off asserts (which should never raise anyway) and instead stops catching value errors (whose absence can never be guaranteed). All that said, if the final answer is: ""if you invoke `-O` you deserve what's coming"", I'm happy to drop it :). Thanks for taking a look at the example. If I understand you correctly, it sounds like I passed the wrong inputs to the function, in which case it might be clearer to raise a ValueError instead of an AssertionError in the end. On a closer look, it seems like most of the instances of `assert(x, y)` are actually in scala code-- my mistake.

Performance,I talked to Cotton about it and he said not to. But it's not clear how much of a difference that makes yet anyway. I think this version is pretty good and an improvement.

Performance,"I think I'm seeing more where this approach is coming from, specifically we put batches as they exist today in a special category of having no updates and avoid the new code path in that case. An alternative which pairs with my above suggestion of not adding new staging tables is that all batches have at least 1 update. I feel like if we can force all batches down the new code path we'll be incentivized to make it really low overhead for batches that only submit jobs once, and that will benefit all batches, as well as simplifying the mental model. I may be wrong that we can do this with minimal performance tradeoff, but I'd like to try it first.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12010#issuecomment-1219807488:602,perform,performance,602,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12010#issuecomment-1219807488,1,['perform'],['performance']

Performance,"I think we should find a time to discuss this in person if the following explanation doesn't make sense. . Right now, for small batches, we send one REST request to the server to both create the batch and create the jobs. However, if we want one REST request for an update (ideal for the query service and low latency jobs?), we have to use relative job ids because (1) we don't know the absolute start index of the jobs until we've gotten the start id of the update back from the server and (2) the job dependencies can be a mix of known job ids that have already been previously submitted in a previous creation/update. The negative job IDs are a way to deal with a mix of relative ids within an update and known, submitted job ids. We can simplify things if we require all updates make two requests to the server to (1) get the start id and establish the update and then (2) submit new jobs with all absolute job IDs. I'd have to make sure this will actually simplify things because I also ran into a bifurcation in how the job IDs are handled in `BatchBuilder.create_job()`. We currently populate the spec with a job id before we've made any requests to the server. We need to know how many total jobs there are before we can figure out the job ids because the API for creating a new update requires reserving a block of job IDs which then returns the start id. This complexity is because we allow multiple updates to occur simultaneously to a batch.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12010#issuecomment-1215919856:310,latency,latency,310,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12010#issuecomment-1215919856,1,['latency'],['latency']

Performance,"I've removed the Python `tempfile` approach in favor of adding `new_local_temp_file` to utils and a corresponding function to HailContext in Scala, which currently hardcodes `file:///temp` as the local temp directory. It may be more natural to have a localTmpDir on HailContext like we have tmpDir. ; I see there is a notion of local temp files on TempDir on the Scala side, but it doesn't seem to be used on the Python side. I also don't see if/where we wipe temp files on exit. In any case, I've tested that now it all works nicely on GCP, so ready for feedback/review. I think factoring through `tofile` and `fromfile` is useful for wider interoperability for the same reason that NumPy exposes them, but it's also good if you donâ€™t want to actually load the NumPy array into driver memory but just save it to read/copy later, or to load it multiple time without recomputing the BlockMatrix. And I've provided the simpler interface of `to_numpy` and `from_numpy` for the common case. I suspect that (de)serializing over the network and building the local matrix dominates local read/write, so that using a socket isn't going to do much better. I can profile more closely if/when we feel it's high priority to make this faster still.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3114#issuecomment-372165433:753,load,load,753,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3114#issuecomment-372165433,2,['load'],['load']

Performance,"Keeping in mind Cotton's queries last week, researched and found much lighter alternative to ExprsesJS for the server api. A few years ago, Express had low impact on node performance; it has become bloated. Found a light (~200 LOC) ""framework"" called Polka, that is small enough to maintain ourselves. It mainly adds light route-matching capabilities, to avoid repeating boilerplate when writing the Node server. Easy to follow. It's also the fastest ""framework"" available, outside of C/Go/Rust. Matches Falcon, and allows 1 language for server/web. (Also Node has a far larger ecosystem).; * https://github.com/the-benchmarker/web-frameworks ; * Polka also nearly compatible with Express's middleware api, so many existing packages are either directly usable, or with minor modifications. This was a desire of mine, since nearly everything server-y for node is really written for Express.

Performance,"On std::unique_ptr, I may be a contrarian, but I don't care what the ""C++ community"" thinks about it.; If you buy into using std::unique_ptr<T>, then everyone who writes or reads the code has to get ; their head around the massively confusing and counter-intuitive concept of move semantics (a ; form of assignment which modifies the source) *and* the somewhat bizarre terminology and syntax; used to express that in C++. And then you get into a whole host of associated design decisions (I'm holding this as a unique_ptr,; but I want to pass it to a function - should I pass it as a raw pointer ? a raw reference ? a reference; to the unique_ptr ?). . I would be fine with that extra learning curve and complexity if unique_ptr<T> solved a difficult; problem. But - by definition! - it doesn't. It only works for the easy case where you have one; pointer to each object. And anywhere that you *might* want to use unique_ptr<T>, shared_ptr<T> provides a superset; of the functionality at only a small extra cost in memory and runtime. So my rule is, if you need; a smart pointer, use shared_ptr<T>.

Performance,"One obvious point of optimization that Dan already identified is the way we were keying our data is causing full shuffles, as we were keying the data by a string variant ID in the form `1-32683987-ACTCTT-A` instead of locus-allele. Changing back to keying on locus-allele fixes this issue for our more straightforward searches, but we have a search that looks for pairs of possible compound heterozygous variants in the same gene, and that still is resulting in 2 full shuffles. I'm a little at a loss for how to fix this, because we are grouping by an unsorted field so I'm not sure how to prevent us from working with an unsorted dataset. The offending code right now is as follows (somewhat simplified for readability):. ```; primary_variants = hl.agg.filter(ch_ht[HAS_ALLOWED_ANNOTATION], hl.agg.collect(ch_ht.row)); secondary_variants = hl.agg.filter(ch_ht[HAS_ALLOWED_SECONDARY_ANNOTATION], hl.agg.collect(ch_ht.row)); ch_ht = ch_ht.group_by('gene_ids').aggregate(v1=primary_variants, v2=secondary_variants); ch_ht = ch_ht.explode(ch_ht.v1); ch_ht = ch_ht.explode(ch_ht.v2); ch_ht = ch_ht.annotate(grouped_variants=hl.sorted([ch_ht.v1, ch_ht.v2], key=lambda v: (v.locus, v.alleles))); ch_ht = ch_ht.key_by(; locus=ch_ht.grouped_variants[0].locus, ; alleles=ch_ht.grouped_variants[0].alleles,; locus2=ch_ht.grouped_variants[1].locus, ; alleles2=ch_ht.grouped_variants[1].alleles,; ); ch_ht = ch_ht.distinct(); ...; # more filtering and annotating; ...; return ch_ht._key_by_assert_sorted('locus', 'alleles'); ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13882#issuecomment-1776044401:21,optimiz,optimization,21,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13882#issuecomment-1776044401,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']
Performance,"Ready for another look. I had to modify the classes some to make it work, particularly for getting the `type` out of the test. Now the type is with the Test rather than the TestResult, perhaps you see a better way?. Related notes, mostly relevant to future PRs once we have some feedback and a sense of performance:. I think LogisticRegressionNullFit should be a separate class, as it plays a conceptually and practically different role. I don't want to attach vectors of length nSamples (like mu) to each LogisticRegressionFit output, even though they would speed up the score test and first iteration of fitting per variant to not recompute them for every variant. I did put some of this efficiency in the score test (only computing the extra coordinate of score and row / column of fisher per variant). df would also then go away for LogisticRegressionFit, but I'd add the diagonal of its inverse for use in Wald (see below). The model fit function would then take a LogisticRegressionNullFit to use in the first iteration. The bigger future gains will come from not computing or inverting the Fisher matrix at all in the iteration, but rather using QR magic. val sqrtW = sqrt(mu :\* (1d - mu)); val QR = qr.reduced(X(::, _) :_ sqrtW); solve QR.R \* deltaB = QR.Q.t \* (y - mu) with R upper triangular (need to wrap lapack function). for Wald: return diagonal of inverse as well, namely diagonal of inv(R)^T \* inv(R), rather than inverting fisher again. for Score, this version of this may be faster:; val sqrtW = sqrt(mu :\* (1d - mu)); val Qty0 = qr.reduced.justQ(X(::, _) :_ sqrtW).t \* ((y - mu) :/ sqrtW); val chi2 = Qty0 dot Qty0. for Firth, modify score using:; val QQ = QR.Q :\* QR.Q; val h = sum(QQ(*, ::))",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/585#issuecomment-241153168:303,perform,performance,303,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/585#issuecomment-241153168,1,['perform'],['performance']

Performance,"Replying to cseed on code-reuse and cacheing/locking. a) Even with whole-stage codegen, there's a possibility that during development a user; will be tweaking a query in ways which don't change all the stages. And in that case the re-use; would give hits on some stages. The plan is not really to aim at structuring things to get a; high level of re-use, but just to opportunistically exploit re-use which happens to occur -; e.g. if the early stages of an analysis involve reading an existing file and filtering in various; ways, then that may not be changed at all by changes to what happen in the real analysis; after the filtering. And this is also influenced by the medium-term goal of having a Hail service; which (amongst other things) can do simple analyses on small data in under ten seconds - in; that realm compilation time could become a critical factor as a serial bottleneck. [The place where persistent cacheing of compiled files helps most of all is in testing,; where you really are running the exact same queries over and over again on the same; small datasets, and in many cases after making small changes which only affect a few; of the queries]. b) We may actually have some version of the locking problem even if we don't try to reuse the files -; since we have several workers on a node, and possibly a master as well, all needing to put code; into a file (or wait for someone else to populate the file) so that they can load it. Depending on ; precisely how Spark manages things (which I wouldn't want to depend on too much anyway). In fact it's essential that all the workers share the same DLL file, because otherwise they'd be; trying to load multiple DLL's defining the same symbols. That aspect of it could be handled by; putting the files into a per-process directory and using in-memory (std::mutex) synchronization.; But y'know, given that we have to write the DLL's out, it just seemed natural to let them persist; (and until debugging it on MacOS, I thought I could m",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-412742385:36,cache,cacheing,36,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-412742385,2,"['bottleneck', 'cache']","['bottleneck', 'cacheing']"

Performance,"Sorry, I wasn't clear before. The Batch LD Clumping example does not require Hail Query (and, more importantly, a JVM) to be installed on *the computer that submits the batch*. Hail is imported and used inside of the Batch task that performs GWAS. That task runs inside a Docker container that has Hail installed (its derived from `hailgenetics/hail`).

Performance,"Sounds good Dan, and agreed it's a long term issue. Regarding point 2, I also don't really like the idea of non-preemtible nodes from a resource utilization standpoint. I think we could probably write our own peak load predictor, or use one of the existing tools, outside of the kube ecosystem. There has been some interesting work using some relatively simple learning models to predict load. It would be interesting to use an RNN for this, but linear regression seems to work pretty well.

Performance,"Thanks @danking for helping with this, and for the nudge to finally get it implemented!. Some more next steps:; * Make a benchmarking setup to collect data on performance and accuracy. I want to use the same metrics for measuring error as [here](http://quantiles.github.io/) (Kolmogorov-Smirnov divergence and total variation distance between the true and estimated CDFs, which are both simple to compute). As a first sanity check, we should get numbers in the same ballpark as they did (worse at first, because we started with a very naive algorithm).; * Make improvements to the algorithm, evaluating the gains in the benchmarks.; * When we feel we understand the behavior of the accuracy measures, we can pick a conservative upper error bound and turn that into an automated test.; * Also once we understand the behavior of the accuracy measures, figure out how to communicate that to users. One thought is to offer a few default choices of parameters, and for each document memory usage, empirical error from our benchmarks, and a theoretical upper bound on the error (of the form ""with probability > .99 the estimated q quantile element will have true quantile q Â± .001""). This allows users to make an informed decision based on their use case. That looks like a lot, but I think those are all relatively simple.

Performance,"Thanks, @tomwhite! This is great. Is there a Hive CLI equivalent of `LIKE PARQUET <file>`? I can't figure out how to get Hive to infer the schema from the Parquet file rather than specifying it explicitly. It would be awesome to be able to query the genotypes, too. It seems like we could write a SerDe (now I'm thinking ImpEx isn't so bad :)) to unpack the genotypes. Does that sound like the right approach?. On a related note, we've played with storing VDS natively as Parquet as (variant, variant annotations, array(genotype)). Even when I ported over some of the GenotypeStream encoding tricks (OD instead of DP, etc.), it was 2-3x larger (using Snappy compression vs. our internal LZ4 compression). That's disappointing, esp. when we have 30+TB datasets on the way. What's worse, simple operations like counting genotypes (`count -g`) are 5-10x in the native representation. Current master:. ```; $ hail importvcf profile225.vcf.bgz write -o profile225.vds read -i profile225.vds count -g; hail: info: timing:; importvcf: 508.829ms; write: 3m6.7s; read: 1.629s; count: 13.934s; $ du -sh profile225.vds; 2.0G profile225.vds; ```. And with the `jg_dataframe1` experimental branch, which uses native Parquet and computes the count using a UDF that computes the sum per array (fastest Parquet-based implementation we've found so far):. ```; $ hail importvcf profile225.vcf.bgz write -o profile225.vds read2 -i profile225.vds count2; hail: info: timing:; importvcf: 492.354ms; write: 5m57.1s; read2: 1.466s; count2: 1m44.1; $ du -sh profile225.vds; 5.4G profile225.vds; ```. That's 2.7x larger and >7x slower. This includes the fact that the Parquet version is only loading the GT field of the genotypes (!). This might be a non-starter for us. We'd love the flexibility and interoperability of standard Parquet.

Performance,"The creeping expansion of the interface is on me as we tried to not break 0.1. I'd appreciate discussing in person what makes the most sense for 0.1. Here are the pieces I think we should separate for devel, though we could consider providing a meta-interface as well that combines some of them for usability. I'm writing (U, S, L) for a local matrix of eigenvectors U, an array of eigenvalues S, and an array of labels L on the rows of U (as with labels for SymmetricMatrix). 1) VDS to a (labeled) symmetric matrix (we have these: GRM, RRM, LD matrix, and Dan is working on a way to read and write them). 2) Symmetric matrix to (U, S, L), which we'll want to write and read. This modularizes the single-core eigen-decomposition bottleneck. 3) Variant-labeled (V, S, L) and VDS with those variants to transport (V, S, L) to sample-labeled (U, S, L). Currently this also requires knowing the number of samples used to make the LDMatrix since that number is used in its normalization. I agree it feels unnatural to need to remember this; to avoid it we'd need an unnormalized version. 4) Sample-labeled (U, S, L) and VDS to global fit of LMM including delta. This is currently a local computation that's been pretty fast in practice but as sample sizes increase we will want to distribute evaluating many values of delta in parallel. Note this step only uses the sample annotations on the VDS, so logically it could also be on KeyTable (which would be the sample KeyTable of the VDS). 5) Sample-labeled (U, S, L), VDS, and delta to per-variant-fit of LMM. This VDS can now contain exactly the variants one wants to fit. (5) should eventually be decomposed as well. The first command should project from Matrix to Matrix (projecting both numeric cells and a list of numeric sample annotations) and some additional small data. Then (6) will do per variant tests starting from after this projection (that is, after what is the BIG computation when you have tens of millions of variants).

Performance,"The problem I saw was this:. ToStream's invariant is that its children must be TIterable. Given this invariant, in boundary it is not safe to call ToArray on streamified when streamified.isInstanceOf[TStream] and node.typ.isInstanceOf[TArray], because this will miss cases (potentially) when node is a different TIterable, and likewise it is not safe to call ToArray on streamified when node.typ.isInstanceOf[TIterable], because we may inadvertently cast a non-array TIterable to TArray, and thereby break boundary's type invariance. So everywhere that we add a ToStream, we need to perform a check on the child: if it's a non-TArray TIterable, return it, else wrap in ToArray, unless we can be sure we never perform said wrap on a TIterable when streamify is called from boundary. . In the latest commit, I simplified the toStream code, and improved the type check to check not TContainer, but (TIterable && !TStream). This is more precise that checking TContainer alone. That being said I haven't created a convincing test yet (though it's trivially easy to make *a* test: pass a ToStream wrapping a node with typ TDict to boundary, with the old check on boundary, and a TIterable check-before-wrap-in-ToStream in the base case of streamify).

Performance,"This PR implements the beginning of the EmitCode and CodeBuilder change discussed here: https://dev.hail.is/t/on-the-subject-of-emittriplet/183/7. The codegen rule for ArrayRef is now the delightfully clear and concise:. ```; EmitCode.fromI(mb) { cb =>; emit(a).toI(cb).flatMap(cb) { (ac) =>; emit(i).toI(cb).flatMap(cb) { (ic) =>; val av = ac.asIndexable.memoize(cb, ""aref_a""); val iv = cb.memoize(ic.tcode[Int], ""aref_i""). cb.ifx(iv < 0 || iv >= av.loadLength(), {; cb._fatal(errorTransformer(; const(""array index out of bounds: index=""); .concat(iv.toS); .concat("", length=""); .concat(av.loadLength().toS))); }); av.loadElement(cb, iv); }; }; }; ```. Summary of changes:. Introduce CodeBuilder. CodeBuilder allows for the imperative, sequential construction of code. The idea is that it is the imperative analog of Code[Unit]. In this analogy, a function returning Code[Unit] becomes a function that takes a CodeBuilder, alternatively, a Code[Unit] can become a CodeLabel: the place to jump to run a given computation. In addition to CodeBuilder, I have a imperative implementation of EmitCode that is similar to the proposal in the dev post: IEmitCode. Under the above analog, the proposal in the dev post would become:. ```; trait IEmitCode {; def apply(missing: (CodeBuilder) => Unit, present: (CodeBuilder, PValue) => Unit): Unit; }; ```. However, I took the additional step of ""defunctionalizing"" this picture by using labels instead of functions of code, giving:. ```; case class IEmitCode(Lmissing: CodeLabel, Lpresent: CodeLabel, pc: PCode) {; ...; }; ```. In this model, the emit function will become: `Emit.emit(cb: CodeBuilder, ...): IEmitCode`. The discipline is after calling `emit`, the contents of the code builder, when executed, will jump to one of `Lmissing` or `Lpresent` (labels which are not defined yet) and the consumer can define those labels, and use the expression `pc` in the code after the `Lpresent` label only.

List all the tags in the repository and include them all as --cache-from's (this doesn't actually work: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34715#issuecomment-425933774); 3. Push a tag for each git SHA and then include as --cache-from's the last ten git SHAs on this branch, the most recent common commit with main (i.e. `git merge-base origin/main this-branch`), maybe the current main, and maybe the PR number?; 4. Write our own OCI image builder so we can write our own OCI image cache that actually works the way it ought to (everything in the registry is considered fair game for the cache). It seems like 3 is actually a decent solution that should enable lots of caching.; 1. The last ten SHAs on the branch should speed up repeated builds when you're fixing little bugs.; 2. The most recent common commit with main should avoid rebuilds unless the packages changed.; 3. I suspect the current main is actually not helpful (either 2 will work or 3 wouldn't help).; 4. Pushing to something like `cache-11907` would allow force pushes to still access the last build's images. What do you think of the #3 proposal? . ---.

Performance,"a simpler solution which was attractive because the microservices are looking more and more like services and less like web servers (even more so moving all the rendering to the front end with the web app, the legacy version of scorecard using jinja is not the representative case). Did you look at aiohttp?; > * From the code:; > > Global variables that are modified ...; > ; > ; > I don't want to have to think about shared state and locking. I want a shared-nothing architecture in the microservices where the only globals are true constants and threads communication by sending immutable data through queues.; > * Finally, a meta-comment. I started reviewing this when it was just ujson, I did a bit of research about json packages to understand your choices and when I came back, the PR had expanded with all the async stuff. I would have approved the ujson stuff. The async stuff could have been a separate PR. Nobody wants to review a moving target, so the scope of a change should be roughly frozen when you assign a PR and additional changes should be minimized and restricted to that scope. You're welcome to have an open PR with no reviewer if you're still fleshing out the scope, of course. Thanks!. In response:. 1) aiohttp is an option, but appears to be generally considered slow on a per-response basis (published benchmarks, haven't had a chance to try it), even potentially slower than flask. It seems wrong to choose something slower if there are are reasonable alternatives.; 2) The globals were a feature of the initial implementation (the GitHub cache). It felt outside of the scope of my PR to change that to some queue solution. Meta comment. Ok. I didn't think it had been looked at, and expanded what it did pretty quickly, as I realized that ujson wasn't helping much. I can make a ujson-specific pr, but my goal was to test async library implementations in a simple applications, since we need a long term strategy for python web stuff that isn't Flask (or not just Flask)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461191051:1796,cache,cache,1796,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461191051,2,"['cache', 'queue']","['cache', 'queue']"

Performance,"bility and complexity matters. Python is not very good choice for high performance system in any case...For me high performance python is a fantasy, but i donâ€™t do aiohttp/python anymore. In the end it is up to @asvetlov"". from one of the creators of aiohttp, I'm not encouraged about the long-term health of the project. https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2902. In the second branch related to this pull request, linked above, I chose Starlette, and it is a thin abstraction, nearly identical performance, over Uvicorn + httptools, which were both written by Yury Selivanov, the asyncio person I mention above. Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 . Starlette is something like base Go performance (though 1/5-1/10th the performance of Go's fasthttp library for simple responses, and much closer for anything involving database calls). Sanic also uses httptools and uvloop, but has more stuff.. so yeah maybe a bit slower than Starlette, or not, but the diff will probably be small. Regarding the benchmark you linked, it is benchmarking the power of sleep. There is something deeply wrong with their results. Sanic has 1800 timeouts, vs 200 for aiohttp, and 3x the connection errors. Fine, so Sanic is super slow. But look at their non-db tests. Sanic is >2x as fast, 0 timeouts. They aren't using anything Sanic specific to query the database, and both use the same event loop. Adding asyncio Postgres to two programs that fundamentally differ mainly in how the handle http requests and responses, shows the one that is faster at http requests/responses (Sanic) becoming much slower, and in fact reversing its relationship to Aiohttp. This is strange to say the least. I was really curious about this, so I ran the bench.

Chunks are loaded in parallel, and no chunks are needed to load the page; it's just HTML on initial render. At least some of the chunks could theoretically be served from a CDN (styles of course, some js). Each package expects a .env file, which organizes the environment variables used in that package. This can be used with Kubernetes. `kubectl create secret generic secretesfile --from-file=prod/env.txt`. The .env for the web app, where localhost would be replaced by our sub.domain.

As an aside I've spent some time reading about this over the last ~month, and besides relatively consistent messaging about the messiness of Python's ecosystem, performance and user experience are deeply important to me, so when I read things like:. ""I donâ€™t think performance matter. I think asgi does not matter in 2018 in general. Usability and complexity matters. Python is not very good choice for high performance system in any case...For me high performance python is a fantasy, but i donâ€™t do aiohttp/python anymore. In the end it is up to @asvetlov"". from one of the creators of aiohttp, I'm not encouraged about the long-term health of the project. https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2902. In the second branch related to this pull request, linked above, I chose Starlette, and it is a thin abstraction, nearly identical performance, over Uvicorn + httptools, which were both written by Yury Selivanov, the asyncio person I mention above. Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 .

Performance,"ember of the ""getting things done"" community than the; ""modern C++"" community. I have seen std::unique_ptr used in practice, and it was a bad experience.; And I stand by my contention that it doesn't solve any of the hard problems (whereas shared_ptr; very much does). Now I realize that people writing books about C++ write a good deal about move semantics and; unique_ptr. My interpretation is that there's a lot of writing about it because it involves concepts; which simply don't occur in any other commonly-used languages, and as such it requires a; good deal of explanation and justification because it's peculiar and unfamiliar. I suggest that; other languages haven't invented this concept because it's a) confusing and b) not particularly; useful. There's one really good thing you get from move semantics: the ability to resize a std::vector<T>; or std::unordered_map<T> without constructing deep copies of each T object. In the cases; where that's useful, it's very useful for optimizing performance without totally bypassing all your; abstraction mechanisms. The other ways people attempt to exploit move semantics are IMO; just a bad idea: if you want to pass around a large expensive-to-create object, then do it the; Java way by putting it on the heap and passing around some kind of reference, and *everyone* can understand it, not just experts in modern C++. Another angle on this debate would be to look at some open-source C++ projects and see how; often they actually use unique_ptr and/or std::move. My guess is that it's much less common; in practice than you might think from reading books about C++, because the overlap between; ""object ownership is passed around"" and ""... but we always know precisely who has ownership""; is not a very big part of the design space - compared to a whole lot of ""always owned by the object which created it"" and ""used in several places at once and we don't know who will be the last to drop it"".

Performance,"h the recur and the break expressions) the type `Bottom`. `Bottom` is the empty type, so there can be no closed expressions of type `Bottom`. In the type checker, `Bottom` is only allowed to appear in tail positions, and for `If`, we keep the rule that both branches must have the same type, so either both branches are `Bottom` or neither are. This keeps the semantics simple: an if statement either makes a value or it jumps away, there's no confusing mix. One nice property of this setup is that if an expression has a non-bottom type, then it is guaranteed not to jump away from itself (it may jump internally), so it is safe to method-wrap. This also make codegen very simple, and @iitalics has already implemented it! See `JoinPoint` and `JoinPoint.CallCC`. In the IR, I don't think this requires much change. If we're already adding a continuation context (as mentioned above), then `TailLoop` just needs to bind both a recur and a break continuation, where recur takes the loop variable types, and break takes the loop result type. Then `Recur` can be replaced by a `Jump` node which calls (jumps to) a continuation in context. There's also a middle ground where we make break continuations explicit in the IR, but we want to keep the scheme-like interface in python. Then the pass @cseed described for inferring where the loop exits are would just go in python instead of the emitter. > Using the stream interface seems wrong to me also. When I mentioned this, I was thinking we could reuse the region management logic from the stream emitter for loops, but I've since changed my mind. I think loops will have hard region management no matter what. > What's the type of the stream the loop turns into? Since loops carry multiple values (by design), memory allocating these to create a tuple stream is going to be a performance non-starter. As a side note, @iitalics stream emitter can handle streams of multiple values fine. Effectively, you can make a `Stream[(Code[A], Code[B], Code[C])]`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7614#issuecomment-559072407:3443,perform,performance,3443,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7614#issuecomment-559072407,1,['perform'],['performance']

Performance,"hat seems like a good spot to me from a developer ergonomics perspective:; - O(trusts) modifications necessary to update/revoke the cert; - O(1) configuration to load a trust list; - no pod-start-time configuration; - the trust list is on the container's file system, so its easy to inspect. Small point: I don't pin the incoming certs yet due to the mTLS challenges. ### create on each deploy. Only creating certs if they don't exist is an easy change. Seems fine, though leaves unresolved how to rotate the certs. I guess I'm inclined to always recreate because it makes rotation the common case, forcing us to make it work well. I think the only way to do a no-downtime rotation is:; 1. create fresh certs; 2. create the trust lists including a principal's fresh cert and previous generation cert; 3. update all the secrets; 4. somehow ensure everyone has the latest secrets?; 5. notify all servers to refresh their certificates (nginx: send SIGHUP, aiohttp: we have to write something). We could stick a generation uuid in the secrets and keep refreshing services until the certificate uuid they read is the one our deploy expects. ### mTLS. This PR will land. Things will break because the unmanaged services (router-resolver, gateway, internal-gateway) do not speak TLS. I'll manually deploy them. The default namespace and new PR namespaces should now function properly. Developers will need to redeploy from master. With this in place, I will make another PR with two main changes:; - enable client verification, and; - modify create_certs.py to load the unmanaged certificates from `default` rather than the local namespace.; That PR should pass all the tests (batch pods will speak TLS to internal-gateway; internal-gateway will speak TLS to PR batch using a client certificate PR batch trusts; etc.). Merge that PR. Everything will function correctly; however, the unmanaged services will not verify client certificates.

In the buildImage case (what this PR addressed), I think it's worth it to keep images small. > for downstream steps that only need a small part of the repo, is it better to copy out different pieces (archived or no) rather than copy the whole thing and extra the parts you need?. I haven't investigated this. I agree, there exists an inflection point where the size of data overcomes GCS latency and GCS-throughput / tar-decompress is the bottleneck. There's something to be said for tar'ing everything except for `.git`, but I didn't carefully check which steps need it and which steps do not. ---.

Performance,"ion strategy. We could probably build an SSLContext shim that contained two SSLContexts one with a root cert and one with the trusted certs and require certification verification to pass both. Seems easy to get wrong, so I'm inclined to not take this path. ### trusted cert lists. Yeah, it felt a little silly to duplicate the cert in each secret. However, this seems like the simplest approach if I require each principal to only trust a subset of incoming/outgoing principals. If I had one secret per principal, then I have to modify build.yaml or deployment.yamls if I modify the trust sets. That seemed error prone. If I had one secret with all the certs, then when a service starts up it has to select the trusted ones and only insert those into its certificate store. This seems OK, but a little harder to inspect. Duplicating a cert for each trust list to which it belongs occupies what seems like a good spot to me from a developer ergonomics perspective:; - O(trusts) modifications necessary to update/revoke the cert; - O(1) configuration to load a trust list; - no pod-start-time configuration; - the trust list is on the container's file system, so its easy to inspect. Small point: I don't pin the incoming certs yet due to the mTLS challenges. ### create on each deploy. Only creating certs if they don't exist is an easy change. Seems fine, though leaves unresolved how to rotate the certs. I guess I'm inclined to always recreate because it makes rotation the common case, forcing us to make it work well. I think the only way to do a no-downtime rotation is:; 1. create fresh certs; 2. create the trust lists including a principal's fresh cert and previous generation cert; 3. update all the secrets; 4. somehow ensure everyone has the latest secrets?; 5. notify all servers to refresh their certificates (nginx: send SIGHUP, aiohttp: we have to write something). We could stick a generation uuid in the secrets and keep refreshing services until the certificate uuid they read is the",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8561#issuecomment-617428243:2339,load,load,2339,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8561#issuecomment-617428243,1,['load'],['load']

Performance,"n by the CI-in-the-PR not overwrite the cache. Every image build for a PR (which is tested by default namespace CI) will still overwrite the cache tag. AFAICT, this; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo; ```; Will use as a cache source the `latest` tag in the `gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo` repository. It is *not* sufficient for an image to be present in the repository and untagged or with a different tag from `latest`. In particular, every push to the `cache` tag prevents us from using other images even though they are in the registry! For example, I pushed two images to `cache`:. ```; (base) # gcloud container images list-tags gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest; DIGEST TAGS TIMESTAMP; fb551d9bdb94 2022-06-10T14:16:39; afb4c5ad2d7b cache,latest 2022-06-10T14:15:55; ```. If I rebuild [1] the most recently pushed image with; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest:cache; ```; it succeeds in getting the cache. If I rebuild the other image with the same import-cache, it does not see that the (untagged) image is already there! . ---. This all suggests that all our attempts at image caching are failing terribly. Options:; 1. Only deploy builds push to a `:cache` tag, everyone uses that tag.; 2. List all the tags in the repository and include them all as --cache-from's (this doesn't actually work: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34715#issuecomment-425933774); 3. Push a tag for each git SHA and then include as --cache-from's the last ten git SHAs on this branch, the most recent common commit with main (i.e. `git merge-base origin/main this-branch`), maybe the current main, and maybe the PR number?; 4. Write our own OCI image builder so we can write our own OCI image cache that actually works the way it ought to (everything in the registry is considered fair game for the cache). It seems like 3 is actually a decent solution that should enable lots of caching.; 1. The last ten SHAs on the branch should speed up repeated builds when you're fixing little",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11907#issuecomment-1152646800:1372,cache,cache,1372,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11907#issuecomment-1152646800,1,['cache'],['cache']
Performance,"n's ecosystem, performance and user experience are deeply important to me, so when I read things like:. ""I donâ€™t think performance matter. I think asgi does not matter in 2018 in general. Usability and complexity matters. Python is not very good choice for high performance system in any case...For me high performance python is a fantasy, but i donâ€™t do aiohttp/python anymore. In the end it is up to @asvetlov"". from one of the creators of aiohttp, I'm not encouraged about the long-term health of the project. https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2902. In the second branch related to this pull request, linked above, I chose Starlette, and it is a thin abstraction, nearly identical performance, over Uvicorn + httptools, which were both written by Yury Selivanov, the asyncio person I mention above. Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 . Starlette is something like base Go performance (though 1/5-1/10th the performance of Go's fasthttp library for simple responses, and much closer for anything involving database calls). Sanic also uses httptools and uvloop, but has more stuff.. so yeah maybe a bit slower than Starlette, or not, but the diff will probably be small. Regarding the benchmark you linked, it is benchmarking the power of sleep. There is something deeply wrong with their results. Sanic has 1800 timeouts, vs 200 for aiohttp, and 3x the connection errors. Fine, so Sanic is super slow. But look at their non-db tests. Sanic is >2x as fast, 0 timeouts. They aren't using anything Sanic specific to query the database, and both use the same event loop. Adding asyncio Postgres to two programs that fundamentally differ mainly in how the handle http requests and responses, shows the one that is faster at http requests/respo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461259030:2451,perform,performance,2451,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461259030,1,['perform'],['performance']

Agreed, too aggressive. > I think we should rely on k8s to pull the 5GB jupyter image in a reasonable time period. No. I'm going to be demanding about making our tools responsive with good feedback (not responsive in the sense of responsive web design, but responsive in the sense of fast). It has to be fast, and when can't be, it has to give clear feedback about what it's doing and how long it will take. We routinely see pulling a 5GB image take 1-2m. That's spin up a VM level nonsense. Kubernetes 1.6 had an SLO to schedule 99% of pre-pulled containers within 5s on a 5K node cluster (from the plots it looks like they were closer to 2s):. > Pod startup time: 99% of pods and their containers (with pre-pulled images) start within 5s. from http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Soglxt0kAI0J:blog.kubernetes.io/2017/03/scalability-updates-in-kubernetes-1.6.html+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us.

Performance,"turing things to get a; high level of re-use, but just to opportunistically exploit re-use which happens to occur -; e.g. if the early stages of an analysis involve reading an existing file and filtering in various; ways, then that may not be changed at all by changes to what happen in the real analysis; after the filtering. And this is also influenced by the medium-term goal of having a Hail service; which (amongst other things) can do simple analyses on small data in under ten seconds - in; that realm compilation time could become a critical factor as a serial bottleneck. [The place where persistent cacheing of compiled files helps most of all is in testing,; where you really are running the exact same queries over and over again on the same; small datasets, and in many cases after making small changes which only affect a few; of the queries]. b) We may actually have some version of the locking problem even if we don't try to reuse the files -; since we have several workers on a node, and possibly a master as well, all needing to put code; into a file (or wait for someone else to populate the file) so that they can load it. Depending on ; precisely how Spark manages things (which I wouldn't want to depend on too much anyway). In fact it's essential that all the workers share the same DLL file, because otherwise they'd be; trying to load multiple DLL's defining the same symbols. That aspect of it could be handled by; putting the files into a per-process directory and using in-memory (std::mutex) synchronization.; But y'know, given that we have to write the DLL's out, it just seemed natural to let them persist; (and until debugging it on MacOS, I thought I could manage it with nothing but atomic file-create; and atomic-rename, but that didn't quite pan out). As for writing LLVM IR, it can definitely be done, because that's what Endeca/Oracle did.

I'm well aware of the potential pitfalls you list there, and more. I just don't think they're a very big deal. I'm also aware of a shit ton of things that are vastly more important than what we're arguing about and we're not talking about those. Let's talk about goals for the project and the landscape of technical risk in our next 1:1. This is assuming we're controlling the compiler in the packaged distribution and on the cloud, we're testing representative user pipelines against gcc and clang, so the scenario you're imagining is either a Hail developer or someone who is sophisticated enough to maintain a Spark cluster (1000x worse configuration nonsense than we're arguing about here, I promise) who is either (1) running old or obscure compiler, or (2) ran into a bug that had test coverage. You're worrying about (1)? What's the worst that will happen, seriously? We'll get a bug report? Let's make sure the compiler version is in the log. > A couple of years ago; > g++ take 40-60 seconds to compile; > fairly heavily templated cod. Can we avoid heavily (or even moderately) templated code? I'm already nervous long-term about the latency of the C++ compiler overhead and if I'm being honest would prefer to generate LLVM IR directly into memory. We should ship whatever compiler is best on the cloud and in the download package. That already covers a vast majority of our users. If clang is the clear winner, we can make that clear in the documentation and maybe warn about gcc it on startup. > But that becomes a problem in itself if we want the shipped compiler to work on a variety of OS'es. Variety isn't a requirement. We don't need to make this hard for ourselves. Let's have two versions: OSX and a recent linux.

Safety,". Then the paper computes a $p \times n$ matrix $W$ called the **SNP weight matrix**:. $$W \coloneqq X^T U.$$. Suppose that there are $n_r$ individuals in the related set and let $Y$ be the $n_r \times p$ standardized genotype matrix for the related individuals. The paper computes the principal components associated with the related samples with. $$ \frac{1}{p} Y W (\Sigma^2)^{-1}.$$. ### Simplifications. The first simplification that I noticed is that we can do away with the $\frac{1}{p}$ terms. Because $\Psi$ is scaled by $p^{-1}$, the inverse of the eigenvalues, $(\Sigma^2)^{-1}$ is scaled by $p$, which cancels out the $1/p$ term in the calculation of the principal components for the related individuals. From here on, let us redefine $\Sigma^2$ as the diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of $XX^T$ (not $\frac{1}{p} XX^T$). Next, by examining the relationship between singular value decomposition (SVD) and eigendecomposition ([Wikipedia link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition#Relation_to_eigenvalue_decomposition)), I realized that it is not necessary to compute $\Psi$. Instead, we can get $U$ and $\Sigma$ from the SVD of $X$:. $$X = U\Sigma V^T,$$. where $V$ is a $p \times p$ basis of the new PCA coordinate space. Then while investigating the meaning of $W$, I realized that $W = X^T U = V \Sigma^T U^T U = V \Sigma^T$. Taking these simplifications into account, I realized that the paper is, in essence, computing $Y V$ to get the predicted scores associated with the related individuals.

Safety,"00 on error. We could return a BadRequest error code with the message 'invalid spec' and then handle the MJC database call on the driver. I chose instead to have the worker to post job complete so we get the error message with the stack trace showing up in the UI as having the normal job flow seemed cleaner to me last week then special casing `schedule_job` on the driver. `post job complete` needs a job object to get the status to send back to the driver. However, a `Job` has two concrete implementations and we don't know which the bad job is because we can't get the spec. Furthermore, the `Job` class does a lot of work based on the spec right now. So I thought it was clearer to just create a new class that had the status, but nothing else. After writing this out, it's probably better to have the driver MJC upon error rather than from the worker. The code below would be more complicated. We'd have to get the traceback / error message from the response from the worker. ```python3; try:; await client_session.post(; f'http://{instance.ip_address}:5000/api/v1alpha/batches/jobs/create',; json=body,; timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=2),; ); await instance.mark_healthy(); except aiohttp.ClientResponseError as e:; await instance.mark_healthy(); if e.status == 403:; log.info(f'attempt already exists for job {id} on {instance}, aborting'); if e.status == 503:; log.info(f'job {id} cannot be scheduled because {instance} is shutting down, aborting'); raise e; except Exception:; await instance.incr_failed_request_count(); raise; ```. And the error handling would look something like this:. ```python3; try:; body = await job_config(app, record, attempt_id); except Exception:; log.exception('while making job config'); status = {; 'version': STATUS_FORMAT_VERSION,; 'worker': None,; 'batch_id': batch_id,; 'job_id': job_id,; 'attempt_id': attempt_id,; 'user': record['user'],; 'state': 'error',; 'error': traceback.format_exc(),; 'container_statuses': {k: None for k in tasks},; }. ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11391#issuecomment-1048213078:1156,timeout,timeout,1156,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11391#issuecomment-1048213078,3,"['abort', 'timeout']","['aborting', 'timeout']"
Safety,"1. For runImage steps, you can only copy out-of or copy into `/io` (the reasoning is a bit complicated and somewhat historical).; 2. For buildImage steps, you can copy out-of or copy into `/`; 3. the `to` of an `output` specifies a file path in a ""filesystem"" that another step can access if it `dependsOn` the outputting step; 4. the `from` of an `input` specifies a file path in the aforementioned ""filesystem""; the filesystem contains all `outputs` from steps in the inputting step's `dependsOn` clause. We also have a `docker/Makefile` which is an emergency manual build system. I update that so that `hail_version` appears in the root of the docker context. The `service-base` uses the entire repository as its docker context, so I place hail_version at the root of the repository. I moved the `version` function from `hailtop.hailctl` into `hailtop`. It seems broadly useful and isn't specific to hailctl in anyway. Your concern about loading from pkg_resources repeated seems well-founded, so I went ahead and loaded the hail_version at package import time. This seems likely to ensure we learn about a missing hail_version file as early as possible (presumably at service start-time). This also means all hailtop installs need a hail_version file. I only found two other places that use hailtop. One of them was a completely unused Dockerfile. I deleted that (`Dockerfile.hailtop`). The other was Dockerfile.ci-test, which I updated to copy the hail_version file just like service-base. https://github.com/hail-is/hail/compare/main...danking:add-version-endpoint. Do you want to cherry-pick that change onto your add-version-endpoint branch?. One more change request: can we remove the try-catch? I don't expect any errors in that call and I tend to avoid revealing anything about errors to our users. Aiohttp will log the error and the stack trace if you let it rise all the way.

Safety,"> The end we're taking the max (in our favor). I'm not totally comfortable with that, e.g. a preemption happens after a job is finished, but the preemption event gets recorded first, you'll charge the user up to the preemption (max) even tho the job already finished. That doesn't seem right. So I see two options:. I intended to always take the min (user's favor) for the end time and the start time should never change but if it does I take it to be earlier in our favor. If the trigger isn't doing that then I got it wrong. Basically, the way I understood the trigger is as follows:. ```; IF OLD.end_time IS NOT NULL AND (NEW.end_time IS NULL OR NEW.end_time > OLD.end_time) THEN; SET NEW.end_time = OLD.end_time;; SET NEW.reason = OLD.reason;; END IF;; ```. This will update the record to have the new end time unless the old end time is not NULL and either the new end time is null (don't want to overwrite the existing value with a null value) or new end time > old end time (don't want to update the record with an end time that is greater than the existing end time in the database). To not override the values, then we need to set the new end time and reason to the old end time and reason to avoid updating the record. Does this make sense? . > Use the reason to update the end time.

Hail is a exploratory data analysis platform, it isn't a SQL engine running nightly billing reports. In particular, as we do whole stage optimization and code generation. It isn't clear to me how you do code-reuse when we're specializing each operation into the global context (happy to hear the plan). For example, tables that have many fields, you will need to load different ones for different queries and in general it is infeasible (exponential) to generate them all. Also, to get sharing you need to break the code up and now you're running the compiler multiple times which also seems bad. Given our focus on large-scale analysis, introducing optimization boundaries for code reuse seems like a bad trade off to me. A significant amount of analysis happens in the cloud where $HOME is ephemeral so you won't get savings between sessions. Finally, there are pipelines that are more standardized but it is my impression they are run on extremely large datasets (hours, overnight) in which case compilation speed isn't important. Finally, there's the complexity around locking that isn't easy and have real technical risk. A compiler cache potentially becomes more appealing in the context of an always-on service. There's no locking issue, and you can start to do things like speculative compilation (e.g. immediately start compiling the decoder (the full decoder? Hmm.) when a user opens the dataset.). I would say getting in a 3x decoder improvement is way more important than this. I would have punted it down the road and instrumented to estimate cache hit rates before building this out.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-410358596:1278,risk,risk,1278,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-410358596,1,['risk'],['risk']
Safety,"> Why is writing the hail table first more efficient than just directly exporting from the grouped matrixtable?. We take special care to ensure our system is as efficient as possible when reading or writing to this native format. So, it's partly a sociological thing. On the practical end of things, Hail's native formats (for Tables and Matrix Tables) are a partitioned binary format. The partitioned part means Hail can use many cores in parallel to process and write the dataset. The binary part means that Hail need not use unnecessarily large (in terms of bytes) representations of values. These three things together make writing the native formats use less time, use less memory, and be more reliable. ---. > One thing I noticed is the mt_hwe_vals variable in my code below is a MatrixTable and not a GroupedMatrixTable. Is this correct?. Yes, after you aggregate you get back an MT with a different column key. ---. The `entries` method converts your matrix table from a compact and efficient matrix into a ""long"" and inefficient table. I generally recommend avoiding it if you can. However, if you only have a handful of ancestries, I wouldn't expect this to be *that* bad. You can just write the MT itself:. ```python3; ancestry_table = hl.Table.from_pandas(ancestry.astype({""person_id"":str}), key='person_id'); mt = mt.annotate_cols(ancestry = ancestry_table[mt.s].ancestry); mt_hwe_vals = mt.group_cols_by(mt.ancestry).aggregate(hwe = hl.agg.hardy_weinberg_test(mt.GT)); mt_hwe_vals = mt_hwe_vals.select_rows().select_cols() # drop irrelevant row and column fields; mt_hwe_vals.write(bucket + '/hwe.ht'); ```. ---. > I tried modifying the code to what is shown below but I'm still having the same issue. Just to be clear it's the exact same error ""Container exited with a non-zero exit code 137. ""?

Safety,"@cseed As I briefly mentioned in an email on Saturday, I moved notebook loading to a prefetched model. Data and page loading are decoupled: When one clicks on the Notebook link, routing to the page happens without waiting for data to come in from notebook-api.hail.is. If data is available, it is shown, else a loading indicator. To avoid loading screens, I call notebook-api.hail.is asynchronously immediately after a user hits app.hail.is, whether they're on the Notebook page or not. Therefore, typically a user will never see a Notebook page loading indicator, when they click from one page to Notebook (say they land on the home page: by the time they click on Notebook, the data is fetched, so no loading screen). Furthermore, web sockets keep that Notebook data up to date, again regardless of whether a user is on the Notebook page. So in all instances except when a user lands on Notebook directly, the time it takes to reach the Notebook page is << 16ms (seemingly ~3ms). A similar approach is now used for scorecard, except Scorecard will render data in the SSR phase (because I consider scorecard less important, and because most users of the web app won't need it), and will not prefetch data when on another page. However, clicking on ""Scorecard"" from another page will not cause routing to block while waiting for the https://scorecard.hail.is/json response; instead a loading indicator will be shown. In practice I find this preferable, because the GUI feels more responsive, and users get more feedback. This demonstrates the core benefit of universal rendering approaches, and how they can improve page loading times over even the leanest server-side rendered application.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5162#issuecomment-462221996:333,avoid,avoid,333,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5162#issuecomment-462221996,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

Thank you so much for hunting this down! It's very valuable information for us. ### Next Steps . So, clearly we need a solution for users that have substantial numbers of related individuals in their source dataset (especially if the pedigrees are unknown). For your _particular_ use case, I can add a blurb to the docs that recommends removing known replicates _before_ PCA and then projecting them using the loadings from PCA. A longer term solution is to simply implement PC-AiR in hail. I skimmed the implementation section of the paper earlier this week and it looks very straightforward. It seems to boil down to using the KING estimator to estimate relatedness, compute PCA on unrelated individuals, project related individuals into unrelated PC space. Finally, we can use pc_relate to improve on our original estimates of relatedness from KING. The timeline for the latter thing is kind of unclear and a bit further out given some other work I need to finish. I'll get the documentation improvement in this week.

Saves ~20-30KB bundle size, and is somewhat faster. However, main Inferno dev moved to React core team, and React is focusing on the optimizations present in Inferno for 2019 (DOM: move to native events where possible), as well as introducing optimizations not found in Inferno (compile time targets: initially inlining, future maybe web assembly binaries; move rendering work to separate thread / concurrent rendering). Furthermore, React ecosystem is orders of magnitude larger, so we can save a huge amount of dev time by avoiding Inferno (N modules * time to develop bespoke module avg), and have greater likelihood of LTS.

Safety,"Oof, good catch! The thing we're trying to avoid is `e^x` overflowing for large positive `x`. In double precision, the smallest `x` that overflows is 710. So to test that we handle overflow correctly, you can check `sigmoid(710) == 1.0` and `sigmoid(-710) == 0.0` (using approximate equality). Actually, after playing with this, if you just use the simple definition `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))`, then `sigmoid(-710)` does overflow, but it returns the right answer since `np.exp(710)` returns `inf`, and `1 / inf == 0.0`. But `math.exp(710)` throws an exception. `hl.exp` seems to have the numpy behavior, so I think the simple version actually works. But we should add the above test. I think wrapping this in an exposed function is a good idea. I agree it should be called `expit`, both for consistency with scipy, and because as you say, `sigmoid` really just means an S shaped function.

One thought is to offer a few default choices of parameters, and for each document memory usage, empirical error from our benchmarks, and a theoretical upper bound on the error (of the form ""with probability > .99 the estimated q quantile element will have true quantile q Â± .001"").

Safety,"The problem I saw was this:. ToStream's invariant is that its children must be TIterable. Given this invariant, in boundary it is not safe to call ToArray on streamified when streamified.isInstanceOf[TStream] and node.typ.isInstanceOf[TArray], because this will miss cases (potentially) when node is a different TIterable, and likewise it is not safe to call ToArray on streamified when node.typ.isInstanceOf[TIterable], because we may inadvertently cast a non-array TIterable to TArray, and thereby break boundary's type invariance. So everywhere that we add a ToStream, we need to perform a check on the child: if it's a non-TArray TIterable, return it, else wrap in ToArray, unless we can be sure we never perform said wrap on a TIterable when streamify is called from boundary. . In the latest commit, I simplified the toStream code, and improved the type check to check not TContainer, but (TIterable && !TStream). This is more precise that checking TContainer alone. That being said I haven't created a convincing test yet (though it's trivially easy to make *a* test: pass a ToStream wrapping a node with typ TDict to boundary, with the old check on boundary, and a TIterable check-before-wrap-in-ToStream in the base case of streamify).

Notice:; 1. The total memory available on the machine is less than 52 GiB (= 53,248 MiB), indeed it is a full 1025 MiB below the advertised amount.; 2. Once all the components of the Dataproc cluster have started (but before any Hail Query jobs are submitted) the total memory available is already depleted to 42760 MiB. Recall that Hail allocates 41 GiB (= 41,984 MiB) to its JVM. This leaves the Python process and all other daemons on the system only 776 MiB of excess RAM. For reference `python3 -c 'import hail'` needs 206 MiB. ---. We must address this situation. It seems safe to assume that the system daemons will use a constant 9.5 GiB of RAM. Moreover the advertised RAM amount is at least 1 GiB larger than reality. I propose:; 1. The driver memory calculation in `hailctl dataproc` should take the advertised RAM amount, subtract 10.5 GiB, and then use 90% of the remaining value. For an n1-highmem-8, that reduces our allocation from 41 GiB to 37 GiB yielding an additional 4GiB to Python and deamon memory fluctuations.; 2. AoU RWB needs to review its memory settings for Spark driver nodes to ensure that the JVM is set to an appropriate maximum heap size. For what it's worth, I think the reason we didn't get an outcry from our local scientific community is that many of them have transitioned to Query-on-Batch where we have exact and total control over the memory available to the driver and the workers.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1836844790:2733,safe,safe,2733,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1836844790,1,['safe'],['safe']

This is passed through, but --py-files is needed (it is not passed through, but modified). Do I leave --files? I'm currently inclined to. Agreed. I support having the most frequently used parameters as `hailctl` parameters, even if they are only simple pass throughs. My original comment about minimizing the number of simple pass through parameters was mainly directed toward `hailctl dataproc start`, which has several options than can be specified separately for master node, worker nodes, and secondary worker nodes. I wanted to avoid cases where, for example, `--worker-boot-disk-size` was a `hailctl` option, but `--secondary-worker-boot-disk-size` had to be specified after a `--` or with `--extra-gcloud-start-args`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9842#issuecomment-767168393:3442,avoid,avoid,3442,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9842#issuecomment-767168393,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

The most recent common commit with main should avoid rebuilds unless the packages changed.; 3. I suspect the current main is actually not helpful (either 2 will work or 3 wouldn't help).; 4.

Safety,"ecur(i + 1, x + i), hl.break(x)),; 0, 0); ```; or, if we're giving names to loops, it might be simpler to pass the break and recur functions to the lambda:; ```; hl.loop(; lambda sum, ret, i, x:; hl.cond(i < 10, sum(i + 1, x + i), ret(x)),; 0, 0); ```. The second difference is in the typing. In this PR, the `hl.recur` expression is given the type of the entire loop. I would add a single new type `Bottom`, and give all expressions which jump (both the recur and the break expressions) the type `Bottom`. `Bottom` is the empty type, so there can be no closed expressions of type `Bottom`. In the type checker, `Bottom` is only allowed to appear in tail positions, and for `If`, we keep the rule that both branches must have the same type, so either both branches are `Bottom` or neither are. This keeps the semantics simple: an if statement either makes a value or it jumps away, there's no confusing mix. One nice property of this setup is that if an expression has a non-bottom type, then it is guaranteed not to jump away from itself (it may jump internally), so it is safe to method-wrap. This also make codegen very simple, and @iitalics has already implemented it! See `JoinPoint` and `JoinPoint.CallCC`. In the IR, I don't think this requires much change. If we're already adding a continuation context (as mentioned above), then `TailLoop` just needs to bind both a recur and a break continuation, where recur takes the loop variable types, and break takes the loop result type. Then `Recur` can be replaced by a `Jump` node which calls (jumps to) a continuation in context. There's also a middle ground where we make break continuations explicit in the IR, but we want to keep the scheme-like interface in python. Then the pass @cseed described for inferring where the loop exits are would just go in python instead of the emitter. > Using the stream interface seems wrong to me also.

As for why read takes so long: not 100% sure yet, setting up batch and CI is still incomplete, and I have not triggered this error myself. My guess is that Kubernetes takes too long to generate the response, either due to garbage collection, or simply because the requested information takes N > 120 seconds to return.

Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 . Starlette is something like base Go performance (though 1/5-1/10th the performance of Go's fasthttp library for simple responses, and much closer for anything involving database calls).

Safety,"ittle unusual in this flow. I still think that it is helpful to set people up with an AR and keep them from footguns, but maybe that can go in a separate command that the initial init command points to once you're done? Something along the lines of ""if you get to the point where you need to upload custom container images, you can use hailctl to set up a registry""?. Another thing that gives me a little pause is the wording around google projects. I get that you need one to create a bucket, but I think we should just make sure to steer clear of the implication that you are ""selecting a GCP project to use for Hail Batch"", because that implies some link or ownership that isn't there. But I think there's a quick fix here: for a given resource that we *are* creating for hail use, like the temp bucket, ask for the name first and then ask which project it should be created in, using the projects listed in gcloud as choices with the option to write in your own. ### Regarding number of checks; I think it'd be good to avoid warnings when possible. From looking at this I see a pattern of; 1. Ask a leading question; 2. Emit a warning if the user selects the alternative option instead of the suggested option. I think I would prefer instead to ask a leading question and in the prompt explain why the alternative option might be undesirable. Then when they make a decision just move on. On a broader note, I think we should focus on having good documentation and linking to it over having perfectly thorough ; explanations in the CLI. At some point in an interactive setup if it gets longwinded I start spamming enter, but if it was quick and at the end it said something to the effect of: ""Your current configuration could result in excess cloud cost.

Safety,"nformation. Nit: the doc doesn't say the instance monitor monitors instances, it just monitors and handles *events*. Let me be explicit: I think the doc is wrong about the monitor doing health checking because that requires it to track the instances, which I just said should be owned by the pools and the JPIM. That didn't occur to me when we were writing the doc, my apologies. I still think the monitor should:; - route events to the right pool or to the JPIM, and; - aggregate summaries up for the web UI. ---. Let me try to be more specific in my critique:. I think of the system as three layers: the top most is the driver, the middle layer is the monitor, and the bottom layer is the pool or JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM). I don't want control flow to go down, up, and back down again. If that happens, then we can't reason about our system as separate layers, we necessarily have to think about the middle and bottom layer together. Very specifically, this flow worries me: (instance pool) create_instance -> (instance monitor) add_instance -> adjust_for_add_instance -> (instance pool) adjust_for_add_instance. We move from low to mid *back to low*. I want information to flow in one direction: either its downward information or its upward information. ---. I'm guessing you're also concerned about code organization / code duplication. I'm not that worried about this. The JPIM and the Pool are similar things and we might inevitably produce some duplication. That's OK with me. To be honest, I think a few stand-alone functions that both of them use will eliminate any code duplication. Both pools and the JPIM will have a `name_instances` and `instance_by_last_updated`. If the duplication gets hard to manage, we might pack that up into another class like InstanceCollection. I realize this means we have several monitoring loops. I'm not very worried about that.

Safety,"t look at their non-db tests. Sanic is >2x as fast, 0 timeouts. They aren't using anything Sanic specific to query the database, and both use the same event loop. Adding asyncio Postgres to two programs that fundamentally differ mainly in how the handle http requests and responses, shows the one that is faster at http requests/responses (Sanic) becoming much slower, and in fact reversing its relationship to Aiohttp. This is strange to say the least. I was really curious about this, so I ran the bench. First, I upgraded Sanic to a recent version. Then I ran their test. In short, their results were not what I found. Sanic is 50% faster, and the timeouts are what you'd expect. 26 timeouts for Sanic, 45 for aiohttp.

Safety,"terface is on me as we tried to not break 0.1. I'd appreciate discussing in person what makes the most sense for 0.1. Here are the pieces I think we should separate for devel, though we could consider providing a meta-interface as well that combines some of them for usability. I'm writing (U, S, L) for a local matrix of eigenvectors U, an array of eigenvalues S, and an array of labels L on the rows of U (as with labels for SymmetricMatrix). 1) VDS to a (labeled) symmetric matrix (we have these: GRM, RRM, LD matrix, and Dan is working on a way to read and write them). 2) Symmetric matrix to (U, S, L), which we'll want to write and read. This modularizes the single-core eigen-decomposition bottleneck. 3) Variant-labeled (V, S, L) and VDS with those variants to transport (V, S, L) to sample-labeled (U, S, L). Currently this also requires knowing the number of samples used to make the LDMatrix since that number is used in its normalization. I agree it feels unnatural to need to remember this; to avoid it we'd need an unnormalized version. 4) Sample-labeled (U, S, L) and VDS to global fit of LMM including delta. This is currently a local computation that's been pretty fast in practice but as sample sizes increase we will want to distribute evaluating many values of delta in parallel. Note this step only uses the sample annotations on the VDS, so logically it could also be on KeyTable (which would be the sample KeyTable of the VDS). 5) Sample-labeled (U, S, L), VDS, and delta to per-variant-fit of LMM. This VDS can now contain exactly the variants one wants to fit. (5) should eventually be decomposed as well. The first command should project from Matrix to Matrix (projecting both numeric cells and a list of numeric sample annotations) and some additional small data. Then (6) will do per variant tests starting from after this projection (that is, after what is the BIG computation when you have tens of millions of variants). That way users can quickly iterate on exploration",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/1984#issuecomment-319971210:1039,avoid,avoid,1039,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/1984#issuecomment-319971210,1,['avoid'],['avoid']

Safety,"vicorn + httptools, which were both written by Yury Selivanov, the asyncio person I mention above. Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 . Starlette is something like base Go performance (though 1/5-1/10th the performance of Go's fasthttp library for simple responses, and much closer for anything involving database calls). Sanic also uses httptools and uvloop, but has more stuff.. so yeah maybe a bit slower than Starlette, or not, but the diff will probably be small. Regarding the benchmark you linked, it is benchmarking the power of sleep. There is something deeply wrong with their results. Sanic has 1800 timeouts, vs 200 for aiohttp, and 3x the connection errors. Fine, so Sanic is super slow. But look at their non-db tests. Sanic is >2x as fast, 0 timeouts. They aren't using anything Sanic specific to query the database, and both use the same event loop. Adding asyncio Postgres to two programs that fundamentally differ mainly in how the handle http requests and responses, shows the one that is faster at http requests/responses (Sanic) becoming much slower, and in fact reversing its relationship to Aiohttp. This is strange to say the least. I was really curious about this, so I ran the bench. First, I upgraded Sanic to a recent version. Then I ran their test. In short, their results were not what I found. Sanic is 50% faster, and the timeouts are what you'd expect. 26 timeouts for Sanic, 45 for aiohttp.

Agreed, too aggressive. > I think we should rely on k8s to pull the 5GB jupyter image in a reasonable time period. No. I'm going to be demanding about making our tools responsive with good feedback (not responsive in the sense of responsive web design, but responsive in the sense of fast). It has to be fast, and when can't be, it has to give clear feedback about what it's doing and how long it will take. We routinely see pulling a 5GB image take 1-2m. That's spin up a VM level nonsense. Kubernetes 1.6 had an SLO to schedule 99% of pre-pulled containers within 5s on a 5K node cluster (from the plots it looks like they were closer to 2s):. > Pod startup time: 99% of pods and their containers (with pre-pulled images) start within 5s. from http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Soglxt0kAI0J:blog.kubernetes.io/2017/03/scalability-updates-in-kubernetes-1.6.html+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us.

OK, here's my picture:; - first time, prompt for password,; - if no notebook is running launch one and go straight there,; - if notebook is running, get a page with a link to the notebook and a link to kill it.

Security,"(i) -> O(i, i)` makes a square matrix whose diagonal is T. * `T(i) -> O(i, j)` and `T(i) -> O(j, i)` broadcast T over a matrix in the two possible directions. Now let T be a 2-tensor. * `T(i, j) -> O(i)` is the vector of row-sums of T. * `T(i, i) -> O(i)` is the diagonal of T. * `T(i, i) -> O()` is the trace of T. * `T(i, j) -> O(j, i)` is transposition. How do we represent matrix multiplication? Let T1 and T2 be 2-tensors. Then letting `T = Out(T1, T2, ""and"").map((x, y) => x * y)`, the matrix product is given by. * `T(i, j, j, k) -> O(i, k)`. In general, an index operation on T requires specifying an output tensor O (including its shape, though you can deduce that in non-broadcasting cases), a set of index variables (eg. ""i, j, k""), and an assignment of a variable to each dimension of T and O. . More abstractly, let DT and DO be the sets of dimensions of T and O. An index operation consists of a set I and two functions DT -> I <- DO, a ""cospan"". These operations compose by cospan composition, which involves a pushout (a disjoint union and a quotient). Let i: DT -> I and o: DO -> I be the two maps assigning index variables. It helps to consider some special cases (compare to the examples above):. * If i is surjective, and o is identity, this is extracting a diagonal from T. * If i is injective, and o is identity, this is a broadcast. * If i is identity, and o is surjective, this embeds T as a diagonal of a higher-dimensional output tensor. * If i is identity, and o is injective, this is a pure aggregation, summing out some dimensions of T. To make composition easy to compute, we could represent an index operation using a union-find structure for I. In other words, an index operation consists of a union-find structure I, and two arrays of points of I, encoding the two functions above. Then the composition of (T, I1, M) and (M, I2, O) is (T, I', O), where I' is computed by taking the union I1+I2, then for each dimension of M, unioning the assigned points of I1 and I2.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5190#issuecomment-457598772:3583,inject,injective,3583,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5190#issuecomment-457598772,2,['inject'],['injective']

Security,"> I think pretty strongly that if nPreservedFields==0, you've done something very wrong. I don't disagree, but if you're concerned about this, I think an assert here is both in the wrong place and the wrong solution. I think for the design the IR, we should focus on (1) simple operations (this is already more complicated than I'd like), (2) that are composable, and (3) minimize special cases. By composability, I mean each IR should have a (local) contract, and each program composed from that local contract should be valid. Breaking this introduces a lot of potential bugs that can't be reasoned about locally, which is not good. The IR nodes do what they do. If you don't like what they do, we should probably find different ones. > so how could you possibly join this with another table? You'd have to create a single partition, and we'd never want to do that. Yeah, create a single partition. Or reshuffle if the partitioner has too little information. How much is too little? What if nPreservedFields==1 and we're down to 1 partition? Should that be an error? 2 partitions? How many partitions is too few? Any time nPreservedFields is less than the requested keys, you could get down to 1 partition. This is a continuous issue and rejecting the extreme case doesn't actually solve the problem. I guess isSorted isn't user exposed, but this seems dangerously close to reporting a user error with an assertion. When the service comes up, hopefully not too long, we're going to want to document the IR and make it public. So if we want to reject this case, we should do it early on: when the IR is parsed and/or constructed. (In general I think to give a nice experience we're going to have to do more up-front validation.) This is what I mean when I say ""find another IR"".

Security,"> So I'm going to insist on the classical loop interface I described above, since it is strictly more powerful than the interfaces you've proposed. I agree that the tail-recursion interface seems like the right primitive to expose in python, on top of which we could implement convenience methods for building while/for loops if we decide it's worth it. > Giving each loop a name seems natural. Apart from the wrapping issue (the greatest existential threat our generation faces) I don't see any problem calling an outer loop from an inner loop. Also agree. This will require either adding another context of loops/continuations in the environment (valid places to jump to, and their argument types), or keeping them in the normal value context by adding a new continuation type. > Is Patrick's proposal for extra types written up anywhere?. My proposal has two main differences. In; ```; hl.loop(; lambda i, x:; hl.cond(i < 10, hl.recur(i + 1, x + i), x),; 0, 0); ```; the point that jumps back to the top of the loop is explicit, but the point that jumps out of the loop is not. I suggested making this something like; ```; hl.loop(; lambda i, x:; hl.cond(i < 10, hl.recur(i + 1, x + i), hl.break(x)),; 0, 0); ```; or, if we're giving names to loops, it might be simpler to pass the break and recur functions to the lambda:; ```; hl.loop(; lambda sum, ret, i, x:; hl.cond(i < 10, sum(i + 1, x + i), ret(x)),; 0, 0); ```. The second difference is in the typing. In this PR, the `hl.recur` expression is given the type of the entire loop. I would add a single new type `Bottom`, and give all expressions which jump (both the recur and the break expressions) the type `Bottom`. `Bottom` is the empty type, so there can be no closed expressions of type `Bottom`. In the type checker, `Bottom` is only allowed to appear in tail positions, and for `If`, we keep the rule that both branches must have the same type, so either both branches are `Bottom` or neither are.

Ah, that's a good point. I'll rewrite to use curl and the client's own certificate and I'll make sure clients trust themselves. ### root cert. I don't think it is possible in aiohttp to both verify a certificate has a valid chain from a root cert and, separately, exists in a list of trusted certificates. The effect would be that every client would trust every server because every server certificate is signed by the same root certificate. I think using a root cert is quite secure (a big improvement over our current situation!). However, I endeavored in this PR to additionally prevent, for example, a compromised `notebook` from masquerading as `batch`. I agree that additionally verifying that the certificate came from a single root certificate (that we, perhaps, destroy after everything is signed) would additionally prevent a malicious user from inserting their certificates into the trusted certificates list. AFAICT, python's `ssl` module has no support for this verification strategy. We could probably build an SSLContext shim that contained two SSLContexts one with a root cert and one with the trusted certs and require certification verification to pass both. Seems easy to get wrong, so I'm inclined to not take this path. ### trusted cert lists. Yeah, it felt a little silly to duplicate the cert in each secret. However, this seems like the simplest approach if I require each principal to only trust a subset of incoming/outgoing principals.

Saves ~20-30KB bundle size, and is somewhat faster. However, main Inferno dev moved to React core team, and React is focusing on the optimizations present in Inferno for 2019 (DOM: move to native events where possible), as well as introducing optimizations not found in Inferno (compile time targets: initially inlining, future maybe web assembly binaries; move rendering work to separate thread / concurrent rendering). Furthermore, React ecosystem is orders of magnitude larger, so we can save a huge amount of dev time by avoiding Inferno (N modules * time to develop bespoke module avg), and have greater likelihood of LTS. Notably, I realized that most of my bundle size was coming from inefficient bundling of Material UI and due to Apollo's insanely large graphQL bundle. Removing these now. Lastly, React is actually very efficient. jQuery is ~31.1KB minified. React is 3KB, while React DOM is 33.8KB. In 2019 React DOM will shrink.

Apollo does something ""smarter"", but much slower: walks a query, checks that the requested fields for a node are the same, and that the node's id is the same, as some other query. 2) no runtime validation of query shape via graphql-tag...uses simple template strings, which are free. We don't care about schema validation in the client...because the server will error when schema is invalid. This should be compile time validated instead, in this case via integration tests. Also removed react-icons... I was going to use this in place of material-design-icons, because I thought loading the full font, when I needed only a few icons, would be unnecessarily expensive. It turns out that I cannot find a library where a single icon import (react-icons or MaterialUI) is smaller than Google's entire material design font: a single font (there are several needed to cover all icons) is ~500B. A single react-icons icon is ~2KB on dev (production may be smaller due to tree shaking). Also, am opposed to CSS-in-JS: slower, worse tooling, larger. Benefits are dynamic selectors, which are really no advantage that I can see (without them can still dynamically apply classes, as in the yee ol days of pleb vanilla js).

A simpler approach is to implement one canonical implementation of the Hail types in C++, fork & slightly modify SAIGE to accept these memory representations, compile SAIGE at Java compile time (i.e. in CI or when you run `make` on your laptop) against these mem reps, ship the compiled library with the Hail JAR, and expose it, via JNI, into the Hail Query language.

So to test that we handle overflow correctly, you can check `sigmoid(710) == 1.0` and `sigmoid(-710) == 0.0` (using approximate equality). Actually, after playing with this, if you just use the simple definition `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))`, then `sigmoid(-710)` does overflow, but it returns the right answer since `np.exp(710)` returns `inf`, and `1 / inf == 0.0`. But `math.exp(710)` throws an exception. `hl.exp` seems to have the numpy behavior, so I think the simple version actually works. But we should add the above test.

Security,"This is caused by domain-by-domain CSRF tokens introduced in [#14180](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14180). An unfortunate side effect is that the tokens available on non-auth pages are no longer able to validate requests to the auth/logout API. Given the lack of apparent noise about this bug in our issues and zulip I suspect that this is not a common path for users, and that a fix along the lines of ""require add one button click to go to the User page first before logging out is acceptable"". On the other hand, the risk of a user clicking on the broken Logout button and believing themselves to be logged out when seeing a `401: Unauthorized` page (but actually still having logged-in state in their browser) raises this in my mind to a security bug rather than just a UX bug or an unfortunate user experience. Therefore my proposal is:; 1. To fix the bug as soon as possible; 2. Accept an additional redirect in a user flow which is rarely exercised; 3. To make the smallest number of potentially risky changes to the underlying security architecture; 4. Therefore: Remove the broken ""log out"" link in page headers and replace with a Log out button on the auth[...]/users page which is guaranteed to have the correct CSRF token in state.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14635#issuecomment-2253086187:213,validat,validate,213,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14635#issuecomment-2253086187,3,"['secur', 'validat']","['security', 'validate']"
Security,"This looks like good start. A few comments:; - I prefer using MySQL over auth0 mainly because it simplifies our eventual backup/restore story. If you think that's simpler overall, great. I don't see how integrating our db with their service does anything for us.; - I assume you're planning to pull the user data from MySQL during the login flow and add it to cookie? I think @danking @jigold and I are interested in nailing down the format for the cookie and seeing an example.; - I agree with @danking we should have an internal id field that's an integer. I think we should use that everywhere, and just use the auth0 id to look up the user record during login. So the integer id would be the primary key and the auth0 id would be unique with a secondary index.; - You need to get the GCP service account key and store it in a secret.; - The GCP service account needs permissions on the bucket. It should be bucket writer.; - Name ""user_secrets"" seems overly specific (buckets and service accounts are not secrets). ""user_data""?; - Please don't give the database a public IP.; - From a usability perspective, for user-visible names I have to say I really dislike long uuids and like the k8s-style short random string at the end. For k8s resource, you get this for free with the `generate_name` argument. For other stuff, long-term, this will potentially require retry logic to make it robust.; - I don't like this create table logic (FYI @danking @jigold). Most database users should not have permissions to create databases.

Security,"Various changes:. 1. Locking is now done with a carefully restricted use of flock(), and the makefiles use; perl's rename command to get atomic rename, so they don't need to take locks. 2. The makefile conforms to the customary use-whatever-is-on-$PATH, with the slight wrinkle that; the full pathnames of the commands used will be visible in the build log - so if someone; picks up something weird we'll at least see it. 3. There is a cache of NativeModule objects, so that we won't do enormous numbers of; calls to dlopen/dlclose. This may help in shuffle code, which creates a new PackDecoder; for each RV. 4. The hash function on (options, source) is now beefed up to cope with having only a; few distinct values of options; and is modified with the output of ""$(CXX) --version"",; so that when you upgrade your compiler, you won't get hits on modules compiled with the old; compiler. 5. build.gradle has a new target ""nativeLibPrebuilt"", for updating the prebuilt/lib/linux-x86-64; or prebuilt/lib/darwin. 6.

Ah, that's a good point. I'll rewrite to use curl and the client's own certificate and I'll make sure clients trust themselves. ### root cert. I don't think it is possible in aiohttp to both verify a certificate has a valid chain from a root cert and, separately, exists in a list of trusted certificates. The effect would be that every client would trust every server because every server certificate is signed by the same root certificate. I think using a root cert is quite secure (a big improvement over our current situation!). However, I endeavored in this PR to additionally prevent, for example, a compromised `notebook` from masquerading as `batch`. I agree that additionally verifying that the certificate came from a single root certificate (that we, perhaps, destroy after everything is signed) would additionally prevent a malicious user from inserting their certificates into the trusted certificates list. AFAICT, python's `ssl` module has no support for this verification strategy. We could probably build an SSLContext shim that contained two SSLContexts one with a root cert and one with the trusted certs and require certification verification to pass both. Seems easy to get wrong, so I'm inclined to not take this path. ### trusted cert lists. Yeah, it felt a little silly to duplicate the cert in each secret. However, this seems like the simplest approach if I require each principal to only trust a subset of incoming/outgoing principals. If I had one secret per principal, then I have to modify build.yaml or deployment.yamls if I modify the trust sets. That seemed error prone.

Security,"gies are in order, I totally lead you astray by mentioning the makefile. The Makefile *is* the source of hail version truth, but invoking the makefile inside an image build step feels wrong to me. Each step creates a layer which inflates the image sizes. Hail's images are already too big!. I took your commits and added one of my own that snags the version from the `copy_files` build step. Because I wanted `service_base_image` to depend on `copy_files`, I had to move the whole step after `copy_files`. This is a limitation in build.yaml: a step must appear *after* steps on which it depends. I also had to move `check_services` for the same reason: it depends on `service_base_image`. File dependencies in build.yaml work like this:; 1. For runImage steps, you can only copy out-of or copy into `/io` (the reasoning is a bit complicated and somewhat historical).; 2. For buildImage steps, you can copy out-of or copy into `/`; 3. the `to` of an `output` specifies a file path in a ""filesystem"" that another step can access if it `dependsOn` the outputting step; 4. the `from` of an `input` specifies a file path in the aforementioned ""filesystem""; the filesystem contains all `outputs` from steps in the inputting step's `dependsOn` clause. We also have a `docker/Makefile` which is an emergency manual build system. I update that so that `hail_version` appears in the root of the docker context. The `service-base` uses the entire repository as its docker context, so I place hail_version at the root of the repository. I moved the `version` function from `hailtop.hailctl` into `hailtop`. It seems broadly useful and isn't specific to hailctl in anyway. Your concern about loading from pkg_resources repeated seems well-founded, so I went ahead and loaded the hail_version at package import time. This seems likely to ensure we learn about a missing hail_version file as early as possible (presumably at service start-time). This also means all hailtop installs need a hail_version file.

Security,"r, there is a [GCS connector](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/cloud-amazon-s3-storage-hdf5-connector/). It's not an object store, but there's also support for [Hadoop HDFS](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hadoop-hdfs-hdf5-connector/). There's also [the Virtual Object Layer](https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/develop/_h5_v_l__u_g.html) which appears to be a file system abstraction that would permit storing HDF5 ""files"" in multiple objects which plays well with cloud object store scaling. We should prioritize an importer because no one has asked for HDF5 export nor is it clear that the HDF5 client libraries make it easy to write a single HDF5 ""file"" from a cluster of cores separated by a network. An importer would look something like `MatrixVCFReader`. It will need to use an HDF5 Java client library. An HDF5 client API is described [here](https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/develop/_h_d_f5_l_i_b.html) but they don't link to any JARs or maven repositories. This [support thread from 2022](https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/how-to-get-started-wih-hdf5-java/10346/14) appears to ultimately conclude that [netcdf-java](https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/how-to-get-started-wih-hdf5-java/10346/24) supports reading HDF5 files. Including netcdf-java in a gradle or maven project is described [here](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-java/current/userguide/using_netcdf_java_artifacts.html). It is not entirely clear how to use netcdf-java to access objects in Google Cloud Storage or Azure Blob Storage. There's an [open issue to support S3](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-java/issues/111). ---. OK, so, this is roughly what I'd do:. Driver side:; 1. Get the schema, cook up a corresponding Hail type.; 2. Choose a partitioning of the index space. Worker side:; 1. Read the same slice of each field/column based on the partition information.; 2. Construct a Hail SType/PType. See `GVCFPartitionReader` for an example. That class is misnamed, it's just a VCF partition reader, its not specific to GVCFs.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14311#issuecomment-1955112694:1824,access,access,1824,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14311#issuecomment-1955112694,1,['access'],['access']

LibreSSL introduced a new interface, libtls, that's designed to be easy to use, secure by default, and match the underlying socket semantics as much as possible.

I think we should a have a root certificate for all services in the cluster and verify all certificates are signed by the root certificate. I don't know how to handle creating new certs on every deploy, either. I think we should just create them if they don't already exist. It looks like you're pinning keys for incoming and outgoing, which is awesome. It looks like you're duplicating the keys for each incoming/outgoing list it appears in. Alternatively, you could break the cert secret into two parts: the private key/config needed by the service, and the certs needed by the clients/servers. > In the long run, I want to fix batch to use an entirely different network for callbacks. I agree. Can we get a task for this? Using authorization to control who can talk to whom is great. We should enforce that with network policies. Defense in depth.

Testability," RV. 4. The hash function on (options, source) is now beefed up to cope with having only a; few distinct values of options; and is modified with the output of ""$(CXX) --version"",; so that when you upgrade your compiler, you won't get hits on modules compiled with the old; compiler. 5. build.gradle has a new target ""nativeLibPrebuilt"", for updating the prebuilt/lib/linux-x86-64; or prebuilt/lib/darwin. 6. The committed prebuilt libraries are built thus:. darwin - On my MacOS laptop, with the default (clang-based) compiler, -march=sandybridge; From my reading, I believe this should be compatible withall MacBook Pro's; released since 2011, and all versions of MacOS since 10.9 (the first to use; libc++ rather than libstdc++ as the default C++ library) - we're now at 10.13,; with 10.14 arriving some time in the fall. linux-x86-64 - Built on my home desktop running Ubuntu-16.04 LTS, and g++-5.0.4, with; -fabi-version=9. In theory this should work with all systems based on g++5.x and; later. I made some effort to move std::string out of the interfaces between prebuilt; and dynamic code, which gives it some chance of working on systems based on; g++-4.x, but haven't tested that. I'm planning to fire up VM's either in cloud or under VirtualBox, to test this against Ubuntu-14.04,; Ubuntu-18.04, and the latest stable RHEL, which should cover most of the bases. In the interest of getting this committed, I have not made changes relating to logging and; error messages. The DLL's are still in the jar, and I think it has to stay that way because; all nodes need to see libhail.so. The header files are also in the jar, and have to be; unpacked in a convoluted way, and that could probably be simplified if/when we change; the approach to packaging. Once this goes in, I can follow it with a PR which adds the NativePackDecoder in RowStore.scala,; controlled by whether environment variable ""HAIL_ENABLE_CPP_CODEGEN"" is defined; (so defaulting to using the JVM bytecode CompiledPackDecoder).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-413997863:1782,test,tested,1782,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-413997863,3,"['log', 'test']","['logging', 'test', 'tested']"
Testability," and much closer for anything involving database calls). Sanic also uses httptools and uvloop, but has more stuff.. so yeah maybe a bit slower than Starlette, or not, but the diff will probably be small. Regarding the benchmark you linked, it is benchmarking the power of sleep. There is something deeply wrong with their results. Sanic has 1800 timeouts, vs 200 for aiohttp, and 3x the connection errors. Fine, so Sanic is super slow. But look at their non-db tests. Sanic is >2x as fast, 0 timeouts. They aren't using anything Sanic specific to query the database, and both use the same event loop. Adding asyncio Postgres to two programs that fundamentally differ mainly in how the handle http requests and responses, shows the one that is faster at http requests/responses (Sanic) becoming much slower, and in fact reversing its relationship to Aiohttp. This is strange to say the least. I was really curious about this, so I ran the bench. First, I upgraded Sanic to a recent version. Then I ran their test. In short, their results were not what I found. Sanic is 50% faster, and the timeouts are what you'd expect. 26 timeouts for Sanic, 45 for aiohttp.

Testability," directly to your last comment. > We have a difference of opinion about the risks. I think I'd say we have a difference of opinion about the importance of the risks. I'm well aware of the potential pitfalls you list there, and more. I just don't think they're a very big deal. I'm also aware of a shit ton of things that are vastly more important than what we're arguing about and we're not talking about those. Let's talk about goals for the project and the landscape of technical risk in our next 1:1. This is assuming we're controlling the compiler in the packaged distribution and on the cloud, we're testing representative user pipelines against gcc and clang, so the scenario you're imagining is either a Hail developer or someone who is sophisticated enough to maintain a Spark cluster (1000x worse configuration nonsense than we're arguing about here, I promise) who is either (1) running old or obscure compiler, or (2) ran into a bug that had test coverage. You're worrying about (1)? What's the worst that will happen, seriously? We'll get a bug report? Let's make sure the compiler version is in the log. > A couple of years ago; > g++ take 40-60 seconds to compile; > fairly heavily templated cod. Can we avoid heavily (or even moderately) templated code? I'm already nervous long-term about the latency of the C++ compiler overhead and if I'm being honest would prefer to generate LLVM IR directly into memory. We should ship whatever compiler is best on the cloud and in the download package. That already covers a vast majority of our users. If clang is the clear winner, we can make that clear in the documentation and maybe warn about gcc it on startup. > But that becomes a problem in itself if we want the shipped compiler to work on a variety of OS'es.

Testability," simple hash-based cache: no need to walk complex graph to normalize cache, because in most cases I'm perfectly fine with not re-using cache across different queries (that may have some shared fields). Apollo does something ""smarter"", but much slower: walks a query, checks that the requested fields for a node are the same, and that the node's id is the same, as some other query. 2) no runtime validation of query shape via graphql-tag...uses simple template strings, which are free. We don't care about schema validation in the client...because the server will error when schema is invalid. This should be compile time validated instead, in this case via integration tests. Also removed react-icons... I was going to use this in place of material-design-icons, because I thought loading the full font, when I needed only a few icons, would be unnecessarily expensive. It turns out that I cannot find a library where a single icon import (react-icons or MaterialUI) is smaller than Google's entire material design font: a single font (there are several needed to cover all icons) is ~500B. A single react-icons icon is ~2KB on dev (production may be smaller due to tree shaking). Also, am opposed to CSS-in-JS: slower, worse tooling, larger. Benefits are dynamic selectors, which are really no advantage that I can see (without them can still dynamically apply classes, as in the yee ol days of pleb vanilla js).

Testability," will issue warnings when used, because it doesnâ€™t distinguish between dependencies that impact the public API of a Java library project and those that donâ€™t. You can learn more about the importance of this distinction in [Building Java libraries](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/building_java_projects.html#sec:building_java_libraries). OK, so, we used to just dump everything into our runtime dependencies. I changed it so that we have three kinds of dependencies:; 1. `shadow`: these are provided by Dataproc/QoB at run-time. They are not in any JAR. They are not on the `testRuntimeClasspath` or `runtimeClasspath`. They are on the `testCompileClasspath` because I [explicitly requested](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/main/hail/build.gradle#L98) that `testCompileOnly` bring in our `shadow` dependencies.; 2. `implementation`: these are included in all class paths and in shadow JARs (but not ""thin"" jars generated by `./gradlew jar`).; 3. `testImplementation`: these are included in test class paths and in shadow JARs. Our test code references these third-party classes:; ```; import breeze.linalg.DenseMatrix; import breeze.linalg._; import breeze.linalg.{*, diag, DenseMatrix => BDM, DenseVector => BDV}; import breeze.linalg.{DenseMatrix => BDM, _}; import breeze.linalg.{DenseMatrix => BDM}; import breeze.linalg.{DenseMatrix, DenseVector, eigSym, svd}; import breeze.linalg.{DenseMatrix, DenseVector}; import breeze.linalg.{DenseMatrix, Matrix, Vector}; import breeze.linalg.{Vector => BVector}; import htsjdk.samtools.reference.ReferenceSequenceFileFactory; import htsjdk.samtools.util.BlockCompressedFilePointerUtil; import htsjdk.tribble.readers.{TabixReader => HtsjdkTabixReader}; import org.apache.avro.SchemaBuilder; import org.apache.avro.file.DataFileWriter; import org.apache.avro.generic.{GenericDatumWriter, GenericRecord, GenericRecordBuilder}; import org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils; import org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.ChiSquaredDistribution; import or",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13706#issuecomment-1738232741:1916,test,testImplementation,1916,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13706#issuecomment-1738232741,2,['test'],"['test', 'testImplementation']"

Testability,"00 on error. We could return a BadRequest error code with the message 'invalid spec' and then handle the MJC database call on the driver. I chose instead to have the worker to post job complete so we get the error message with the stack trace showing up in the UI as having the normal job flow seemed cleaner to me last week then special casing `schedule_job` on the driver. `post job complete` needs a job object to get the status to send back to the driver. However, a `Job` has two concrete implementations and we don't know which the bad job is because we can't get the spec. Furthermore, the `Job` class does a lot of work based on the spec right now. So I thought it was clearer to just create a new class that had the status, but nothing else. After writing this out, it's probably better to have the driver MJC upon error rather than from the worker. The code below would be more complicated. We'd have to get the traceback / error message from the response from the worker. ```python3; try:; await client_session.post(; f'http://{instance.ip_address}:5000/api/v1alpha/batches/jobs/create',; json=body,; timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=2),; ); await instance.mark_healthy(); except aiohttp.ClientResponseError as e:; await instance.mark_healthy(); if e.status == 403:; log.info(f'attempt already exists for job {id} on {instance}, aborting'); if e.status == 503:; log.info(f'job {id} cannot be scheduled because {instance} is shutting down, aborting'); raise e; except Exception:; await instance.incr_failed_request_count(); raise; ```. And the error handling would look something like this:. ```python3; try:; body = await job_config(app, record, attempt_id); except Exception:; log.exception('while making job config'); status = {; 'version': STATUS_FORMAT_VERSION,; 'worker': None,; 'batch_id': batch_id,; 'job_id': job_id,; 'attempt_id': attempt_id,; 'user': record['user'],; 'state': 'error',; 'error': traceback.format_exc(),; 'container_statuses': {k: None for k in tasks},; }. ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11391#issuecomment-1048213078:1325,log,log,1325,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11391#issuecomment-1048213078,3,['log'],['log']
Testability,"1. For runImage steps, you can only copy out-of or copy into `/io` (the reasoning is a bit complicated and somewhat historical).; 2. For buildImage steps, you can copy out-of or copy into `/`; 3. the `to` of an `output` specifies a file path in a ""filesystem"" that another step can access if it `dependsOn` the outputting step; 4. the `from` of an `input` specifies a file path in the aforementioned ""filesystem""; the filesystem contains all `outputs` from steps in the inputting step's `dependsOn` clause. We also have a `docker/Makefile` which is an emergency manual build system. I update that so that `hail_version` appears in the root of the docker context. The `service-base` uses the entire repository as its docker context, so I place hail_version at the root of the repository. I moved the `version` function from `hailtop.hailctl` into `hailtop`. It seems broadly useful and isn't specific to hailctl in anyway. Your concern about loading from pkg_resources repeated seems well-founded, so I went ahead and loaded the hail_version at package import time. This seems likely to ensure we learn about a missing hail_version file as early as possible (presumably at service start-time). This also means all hailtop installs need a hail_version file. I only found two other places that use hailtop. One of them was a completely unused Dockerfile. I deleted that (`Dockerfile.hailtop`). The other was Dockerfile.ci-test, which I updated to copy the hail_version file just like service-base. https://github.com/hail-is/hail/compare/main...danking:add-version-endpoint. Do you want to cherry-pick that change onto your add-version-endpoint branch?. One more change request: can we remove the try-catch? I don't expect any errors in that call and I tend to avoid revealing anything about errors to our users. Aiohttp will log the error and the stack trace if you let it rise all the way. Sorry for all the complication! Our build system is the second service we built and is clearly showing its age.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/10085#issuecomment-789279401:2223,test,test,2223,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/10085#issuecomment-789279401,2,"['log', 'test']","['log', 'test']"

Testability,"> I believe you're referencing Chrome Bug 675308 which suggests that lines thicker than 1 are broken in some versions of Chrome. My change uses line width 1. My point was that there are browser inconsistencies. > The screenshots you shared seem to suggest that Brave is making the lines somewhat fainter than Safari. I can't explain that. . I also can't explain it, and haven't found a Safari bug that would suggest why this is the case, and yet it is clear from that screenshot that there is a difference. > It feels brittle to fiddle with device pixel ratio and line width to try and simulate line widths smaller than a pixel. My current mental model is that we're just hitting a resolution issue. Internally threejs I believe sets the webgl buffer to pixelRatio * width/height. With resolution 1, resolution seems too low, and this causes fuzzy lines. I don't know why it doesn't work better. To test this hypothesis, I've tried setting pixelRatio to 1 manually on a hidpi display, and it gave a similar fuzzy/thick result, which of course doesn't make any sense if linewidth actually did what it seems it should, and so I agree that not relying on linewidth would be nicer, but would also be additional work.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8964#issuecomment-646227792:899,test,test,899,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8964#issuecomment-646227792,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"> I think pretty strongly that if nPreservedFields==0, you've done something very wrong. I don't disagree, but if you're concerned about this, I think an assert here is both in the wrong place and the wrong solution. I think for the design the IR, we should focus on (1) simple operations (this is already more complicated than I'd like), (2) that are composable, and (3) minimize special cases. By composability, I mean each IR should have a (local) contract, and each program composed from that local contract should be valid. Breaking this introduces a lot of potential bugs that can't be reasoned about locally, which is not good. The IR nodes do what they do. If you don't like what they do, we should probably find different ones. > so how could you possibly join this with another table? You'd have to create a single partition, and we'd never want to do that. Yeah, create a single partition. Or reshuffle if the partitioner has too little information. How much is too little? What if nPreservedFields==1 and we're down to 1 partition? Should that be an error? 2 partitions? How many partitions is too few? Any time nPreservedFields is less than the requested keys, you could get down to 1 partition. This is a continuous issue and rejecting the extreme case doesn't actually solve the problem. I guess isSorted isn't user exposed, but this seems dangerously close to reporting a user error with an assertion. When the service comes up, hopefully not too long, we're going to want to document the IR and make it public. So if we want to reject this case, we should do it early on: when the IR is parsed and/or constructed. (In general I think to give a nice experience we're going to have to do more up-front validation.) This is what I mean when I say ""find another IR"".

Testability,"> Sorry, I wasn't clear before. The Batch LD Clumping example does not require Hail Query (and, more importantly, a JVM) to be installed on *the computer that submits the batch*. Hail is imported and used inside of the Batch task that performs GWAS. That task runs inside a Docker container that has Hail installed (its derived from `hailgenetics/hail`).; > ; > ; > ; > I'm hesitant to make the *submission* of a batch dependent on the Hail Query library. Particularly when we have relatively low-effort alternative approaches. I'm delighted any time I see batch tasks use Hail Query! Konrad's Pan UKB work also does this. Right I realize this, why I mentioned unit test (to make unit tests work without calling hail, we would need to wrap each function we want to test in a cli interface, and then containerise those functions...this seems not so friendly to contributors). A 2nd question: how would a contributor submit write hybrid hail query/batch code that called batch from within a hail query script? So hail transforms data, say generates pc's, writes table, and then issues some batch commands that use a pre-built image, as opposed to requiring them to containerise their hail cod3. This will be useful: containerisation is the stated biggest pain point of batch, from my interviews. And one of the biggest hail issues is shuttling data between hail and other processes, which has led people to ask for tighter integration, or more statistical tools (so that they don't need to go out to those other tools, like plink). Showing Batch working from within hail-query scripts would be useful because it will show a much easier integration, and those examples or contributed modules should live somewhere (and that seems not to be hailtop, because this requires batch to be called from code that is calling hail directly, rather than through an image).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9194#issuecomment-671459432:666,test,test,666,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9194#issuecomment-671459432,3,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"
Testability,"> Thanks for sharing this detailed plan!; > ; > So, I don't currently have any plan for, I suppose, ""applications"" that use Batch. Since we plan to support, maintain, and test the Hail Batch regenie implementation, I think it doesn't belong in a ""contrib"" directory. The hail python package has a `genetics` module for genetics-specific Hail Query functionality, let's mirror that structure. Let's move REGENIE and any non-Python dependencies of it into `hailtop/batch/genetics/regenie`. Sure. > How is the Dockerfile meant to be used? As written it doesn't appear that it would work because there doesn't exist any regenie source code to COPY in. It's meant to create a Regenie docker image that we could use. It's a copy of the regenie c++ repo's dockerfile, with the removal of the ENTRYPOINT /usr/local/bin/regenie, so that I could issue a command that included an executable, which is convenient to give me the ability to check that intermediate files are actually created (wc, ls) by batch, and because that seems more idiomatic for batch.

Testability,"> Why is writing the hail table first more efficient than just directly exporting from the grouped matrixtable?. We take special care to ensure our system is as efficient as possible when reading or writing to this native format. So, it's partly a sociological thing. On the practical end of things, Hail's native formats (for Tables and Matrix Tables) are a partitioned binary format. The partitioned part means Hail can use many cores in parallel to process and write the dataset. The binary part means that Hail need not use unnecessarily large (in terms of bytes) representations of values. These three things together make writing the native formats use less time, use less memory, and be more reliable. ---. > One thing I noticed is the mt_hwe_vals variable in my code below is a MatrixTable and not a GroupedMatrixTable. Is this correct?. Yes, after you aggregate you get back an MT with a different column key. ---. The `entries` method converts your matrix table from a compact and efficient matrix into a ""long"" and inefficient table. I generally recommend avoiding it if you can. However, if you only have a handful of ancestries, I wouldn't expect this to be *that* bad. You can just write the MT itself:. ```python3; ancestry_table = hl.Table.from_pandas(ancestry.astype({""person_id"":str}), key='person_id'); mt = mt.annotate_cols(ancestry = ancestry_table[mt.s].ancestry); mt_hwe_vals = mt.group_cols_by(mt.ancestry).aggregate(hwe = hl.agg.hardy_weinberg_test(mt.GT)); mt_hwe_vals = mt_hwe_vals.select_rows().select_cols() # drop irrelevant row and column fields; mt_hwe_vals.write(bucket + '/hwe.ht'); ```. ---. > I tried modifying the code to what is shown below but I'm still having the same issue. Just to be clear it's the exact same error ""Container exited with a non-zero exit code 137. ""?

Testability,"> all options that are also gcloud options (such as --project)? [That] could be difficult. Yes, this is what I was thinking. `hailctl` could parse (as much as is needed) the `gcloud` options to find options (like `--project`) and modify others (like `--initialization-actions`). The latter is somewhat surprising since one expects everything after the `--` to pass through unchanged. OK, summarizing our options so far:. - hailctl has no options that are also gcloud options. gcloud options go after the `--`, and get modified as needed by hailctl (with a message).; - hailctl has no gcloud options that are simply pass through. gcloud options that are needed by hailctl commands are hailctl options (like `--project`). When a gcloud option is needed by some hailctl command, all hailctl commands take that option (when it makes sense), even if in some cases that makes them simply pass through. This fixes the inconsistency issues, but the user still needs to keep track of which gcloud options needs to be passed to hailctl and which are passed to gcloud directly. If you specify an option twice, once to hailctl and once to gcloud, we invoke gcloud with the option duplicated. Pros and cons:; - The first option has the most consistent interface.; - The first option modifies options after the --, which is surprising.; - The first option involves replication (some of) the gcloud option parsing semantics, which is annoying.; - The second option requires the user to know which gcloud options need to be passed to hailctl instead (but globally, not per-command).; - With the second option, if we want to warn (or error) on duplicate options, we're back to duplicating the gcloud option parsing logic. I think I'm coming around to the second option. > so that hailctl dataproc submit cluster -- --script-options would work.

Testability,"@jigold OK, so here's the summary of what I learned:. We don't have tabix files for GRCh38 and we only test on small positions. Many large positions without tabix files seems to cause a problem for VEP (and make it slow, unsurprisingly). Fix seems to be to download the *indexed* homo_sapiens cache https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-95/variation/indexed_vep_cache/ and upload that to our QoB VEP bucket. I presume you copied from the data we use in Dataproc? If yes, we should update that to also have tabix files. Also, in Dataproc, we use highmem machines for VEP.

This is a little weird because it gets called in fb.classAsBytes(), and so calling it earlier will basically add the instructions again, and we should never do this. I'm thinking of adding some logic to check that a method isn't ""closed"", or at least clearing out the instruction buffer afterwards.; - I want to implement `<init>` in terms of the method builder, but we don't have a way to deal with Unit return types well yet. Dan's made a crack at this as part of #2555, so I'm going to hold off on that until I can use that.; - We realized that the auto-adding of a return op at the end of the method was causing some extra bytecode to be added at the end of the method if you explicitly called Code._return() to return the last Code object in the method.

Testability,"Ah, I understand. You're correct that pushing to the `cache` tag disassociates that tag with any image that was previously associated with it. That image is still in the registry though. I thought that was sufficient for the cache to work. (I was wrong, see below!). AFAICT, this change doesn't prevent PR tests from pushing to the `cache` tag. This change just makes the tests run by the CI-in-the-PR not overwrite the cache. Every image build for a PR (which is tested by default namespace CI) will still overwrite the cache tag. AFAICT, this; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo; ```; Will use as a cache source the `latest` tag in the `gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo` repository. It is *not* sufficient for an image to be present in the repository and untagged or with a different tag from `latest`. In particular, every push to the `cache` tag prevents us from using other images even though they are in the registry! For example, I pushed two images to `cache`:. ```; (base) # gcloud container images list-tags gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest; DIGEST TAGS TIMESTAMP; fb551d9bdb94 2022-06-10T14:16:39; afb4c5ad2d7b cache,latest 2022-06-10T14:15:55; ```. If I rebuild [1] the most recently pushed image with; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest:cache; ```; it succeeds in getting the cache. If I rebuild the other image with the same import-cache, it does not see that the (untagged) image is already there! . ---. This all suggests that all our attempts at image caching are failing terribly. Options:; 1. Only deploy builds push to a `:cache` tag, everyone uses that tag.; 2. List all the tags in the repository and include them all as --cache-from's (this doesn't actually work: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34715#issuecomment-425933774); 3.

Testability,"All that messy state twiddling is because Scala's `Iterator` is the wrong model for most things we use it for, which is why I made `FlipbookIterator`.

Saves ~20-30KB bundle size, and is somewhat faster. However, main Inferno dev moved to React core team, and React is focusing on the optimizations present in Inferno for 2019 (DOM: move to native events where possible), as well as introducing optimizations not found in Inferno (compile time targets: initially inlining, future maybe web assembly binaries; move rendering work to separate thread / concurrent rendering). Furthermore, React ecosystem is orders of magnitude larger, so we can save a huge amount of dev time by avoiding Inferno (N modules * time to develop bespoke module avg), and have greater likelihood of LTS. Notably, I realized that most of my bundle size was coming from inefficient bundling of Material UI and due to Apollo's insanely large graphQL bundle. Removing these now. Lastly, React is actually very efficient. jQuery is ~31.1KB minified. React is 3KB, while React DOM is 33.8KB. In 2019 React DOM will shrink. In any case, given that React is both faster than jQuery, dramatically simplifies development, and introduces development structure, 4KB cost is imo worth it.

Testability,"Further pruned. Removed all GraphQL libraries, besides graphql-tag, which I like, because 1) simple hash-based cache: no need to walk complex graph to normalize cache, because in most cases I'm perfectly fine with not re-using cache across different queries (that may have some shared fields). Apollo does something ""smarter"", but much slower: walks a query, checks that the requested fields for a node are the same, and that the node's id is the same, as some other query. 2) no runtime validation of query shape via graphql-tag...uses simple template strings, which are free. We don't care about schema validation in the client...because the server will error when schema is invalid. This should be compile time validated instead, in this case via integration tests. Also removed react-icons... I was going to use this in place of material-design-icons, because I thought loading the full font, when I needed only a few icons, would be unnecessarily expensive. It turns out that I cannot find a library where a single icon import (react-icons or MaterialUI) is smaller than Google's entire material design font: a single font (there are several needed to cover all icons) is ~500B. A single react-icons icon is ~2KB on dev (production may be smaller due to tree shaking). Also, am opposed to CSS-in-JS: slower, worse tooling, larger. Benefits are dynamic selectors, which are really no advantage that I can see (without them can still dynamically apply classes, as in the yee ol days of pleb vanilla js).

Testability,"Hey @natestockham,. I'm glad you resolved the breeze issue. I imagine you were encountering a situation where the native libraries were not extant / not where expected / not the correct architecture. Three of the newly failing tests are related to plink. The output included in `tests.zip` indicates that you're using a fairly old version of plink,; ```; PLINK v1.90b1b 64-bit (20 May 2014); ```; Our testing server uses versions of plink from 2016. It's possible these tests are over constrained and need to be relaxed. I will investigate the precision required to pass the two tests in `IBDSuite`. However, part of one failure in the `IBDSuite` and the failure in the `ImputeSexSuite` are both caused by plink failing to produce output on certain input files. I strongly suspect these are bugs in plink version `1.90b1b` because plink `1.90b3.38` (from 2016, the version used on our test server) does not err on such files. This leaves one final test: `LinearMixedRegressionSuite.genAndFitLMM`. This is the test I have been writing about above and I can confirm that this is a bug (or, perhaps, overly precise test) **on our end** that we are actively investigating.

Testability,"Hi @danking, thanks for this. On the topic of asserts, there are really two interacting issues:. 1. Asserts are intended to ensure invariants, i.e. conditions that should always be true. In correct code, assertions should never raise so disabling them should have no consequences at runtime. In practice, however, they are often casually used to catch value errors, which can be expected to occur if a user-facing method receives bad/nonsensical inputs (e.g. here: https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/1940547d35ddddb084ad52684e36153c1e03a331/hail/python/hailtop/hailctl/dataproc/diagnose.py#L62); 2. Python's language design allows anyone calling your code to disable asserts for optimization purposes, because disabling asserts should never change the semantics of the program. Putting these two features together, you can arrive at a situation where a user thinks they're turning off asserts (which should never raise anyway) and instead stops catching value errors (whose absence can never be guaranteed). All that said, if the final answer is: ""if you invoke `-O` you deserve what's coming"", I'm happy to drop it :). Thanks for taking a look at the example. If I understand you correctly, it sounds like I passed the wrong inputs to the function, in which case it might be clearer to raise a ValueError instead of an AssertionError in the end. On a closer look, it seems like most of the instances of `assert(x, y)` are actually in scala code-- my mistake.

Writing the rule for the apply node should fix that.; ```. Right. It's just that I tried to write the rule, and quickly ran across the fact that Seq[IR] would be inferred such that the first IR had a different type from the 2nd or Nth. This is what I had written:. ```scala; case ApplySpecial(name, irs) => {; val it = irs.iterator; val head = it.next(); head.inferSetPType(env). while(it.hasNext) {; val value = it.next(). value.inferSetPType(env); assert(value.pType2 == head.pType2); }. head.pType2; }; ```. With the result in one case that `head.pType2` was bool, `value.pType2` was something else. Without a type union, it wasn't clear to me what to return. One possibility was that I shouldn't handle this node, so I started with that possibility, which I know understand isn't right. The other was that the implementation was wrong, and my first guess there is that one of the IRs dictates the type (say the first), the 2nd is that there is a simple precedence rule, the 3rd is that the type inference procedure has some branching logic over the collection.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6594#issuecomment-513007861:616,assert,assert,616,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6594#issuecomment-513007861,2,"['assert', 'log']","['assert', 'logic']"

Testability,"I made some edits that I think helped to reduce the number of places that are aware of the notion of a default_region. It's really now just isolated to the `InstanceCollectionManager`, since that's the piece of code that's making the decision ""use the default region when the cluster is small"". I didn't quite like the pattern of retrieving a default from a `LocationMonitor` just to give it right back to the location monitor in the next line. I think this way the `LocationMonitor` API is much simpler, and we can actually remove its `default_location` method entirely as I believe it is no longer used. I can do that in a follow-up PR if you like this approach. One other thing is I wanted to articulate the distinction between the ""region CI needs its jobs in"" and the ""default region that batch will spin up workers in for small clusters"". While they are in practice the same, I found that treating them both as the ""default_region"" tied the logic around jobs for CI closely with internal Batch decisions and made it more confusing for me to reason about. I tried to separate out these two concepts so that in the future when jobs support region-specific scheduling it will be easier to excise the CI-specific code from the Batch scheduler. Another thing that I realized during this process is that Azure has regions and zones just like GCP, though they may differ slightly since we don't need to specify a zone for a VM and such. I am fine with using the term ""location"" to mean ""where we scheduled the VM, either zone or region depending on the cloud provider"", but I would also like to follow up with a sweep that makes this language more precise where possible. For example, the `possible_cloud_locations` function is really just `possible_cloud_regions`, and we could even go so far as mandating a `region` field in the global config instead of having `azure_location` and `gcp_region`, which are synonymous even though named differently.

Testability,"I think tying the reset to the iterator is a mistake. First, iterator is the wrong abstraction here. Whole-stage code generation should use the aggregator/array strategy we're using in Emit to generate nothing, conditionals and loops for map, filter and flatMap, respectively. Ideally read ... do stuff ... write will generate an RDD with no per-element iterators at all. I want to make sure this picture is clear. Second, we want to vectorize in the database sense: we want to process multiple rows together in batches. Then overall structure of a stage is a loop over the batches, and and a loop within batches. Thus, the common case should not be we reset after every element, so I think it's the wrong direction to bake it in. The place where we do this should be interface points with the Spark stack which should be looked at with scorn and derision and as the organizing model. Finally, this points to an ongoing difference in our views about the meaning of context. I see context as serving two purposes (neither of which involve reset):. - First, context is a set of resources needed to process a partition that should be released when the partition is complete. For example, I'm working on GenomicsDB which needs to localize a GenomicsDB shard to a local file that needs to be cleaned up when the partition is complete. - Second, it is a way to tell an iterator where to return its value. (This is the ""current"" region business.). I'd be happy to separate these, but I don't see clean way.

Testability,"I'm fairly certain I know understand this and the AoU VDS creation issue. In Dataproc versions 1.5.74, 2.0.48, and 2.1.0, Dataproc introduced ""memory protection"" which is a euphemism for a newly aggressive OOMKiller. When the OOMKiller kills the JVM driver process, there is no hs_err_pid...log file, no exceptional log statements, and no clean shutdown of any sockets. The process is simply SIGTERM'ed and then SIGKILL'ed. From Hail 0.2.83 through Hail 0.2.109 (released February 2023), Hail was pinned to Dataproc 2.0.44. From Hail 0.2.15 onwards, `hailctl dataproc`, by default, reserves 80% of the advertised memory of the driver node for the use of the Hail Query Driver JVM process. For example, Google advertises that an n1-highmem-8 has 52 GiB of RAM, so Hail sets the `spark:spark.driver.memory` property to `41g` (we always round down). Before aggressive memory protection, this setting was sufficient to protect the driver from starving itself of memory. Unfortunately, Hail 0.2.110 upgraded to Dataproc 2.1.2 which enabled ""memory protection"". Moreover, in the years since Hail 0.2.15, the memory in use by system processes on Dataproc driver nodes appears to have increased. Due to these two circumstances, the driver VM's memory usage can grow high enough to trigger the OOMKiller before the JVM triggers a GC. Consider, for example, these slices of the syslog of the n1-highmem-8 driver VM of a Dataproc cluster:. ```; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: earlyoom v1.6.2; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: mem total: 52223 MiB, swap total: 0 MiB; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: sending SIGTERM when mem <= 0.12% and swap <= 1.00%,; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: SIGKILL when mem <= 0.06% and swap <= 0.50%; ...; Nov 22 14:30:05 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m post-hdfs-startup-script[7747]: + echo 'All done'; Nov 22 14:30:05 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m post-hdfs-startup-script[7",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1836844790:291,log,log,291,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1836844790,2,['log'],['log']

Testability,"I've removed the Python `tempfile` approach in favor of adding `new_local_temp_file` to utils and a corresponding function to HailContext in Scala, which currently hardcodes `file:///temp` as the local temp directory. It may be more natural to have a localTmpDir on HailContext like we have tmpDir. ; I see there is a notion of local temp files on TempDir on the Scala side, but it doesn't seem to be used on the Python side. I also don't see if/where we wipe temp files on exit. In any case, I've tested that now it all works nicely on GCP, so ready for feedback/review. I think factoring through `tofile` and `fromfile` is useful for wider interoperability for the same reason that NumPy exposes them, but it's also good if you donâ€™t want to actually load the NumPy array into driver memory but just save it to read/copy later, or to load it multiple time without recomputing the BlockMatrix. And I've provided the simpler interface of `to_numpy` and `from_numpy` for the common case. I suspect that (de)serializing over the network and building the local matrix dominates local read/write, so that using a socket isn't going to do much better.

As for why read takes so long: not 100% sure yet, setting up batch and CI is still incomplete, and I have not triggered this error myself. My guess is that Kubernetes takes too long to generate the response, either due to garbage collection, or simply because the requested information takes N > 120 seconds to return. That would be a very long time for any reasonable response, so either the resource isn't ready and it waits, or there are network connectivity issues. If network issues, not sure what solutions are.

Testability,"Oof, good catch! The thing we're trying to avoid is `e^x` overflowing for large positive `x`. In double precision, the smallest `x` that overflows is 710. So to test that we handle overflow correctly, you can check `sigmoid(710) == 1.0` and `sigmoid(-710) == 0.0` (using approximate equality). Actually, after playing with this, if you just use the simple definition `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))`, then `sigmoid(-710)` does overflow, but it returns the right answer since `np.exp(710)` returns `inf`, and `1 / inf == 0.0`. But `math.exp(710)` throws an exception. `hl.exp` seems to have the numpy behavior, so I think the simple version actually works. But we should add the above test. I think wrapping this in an exposed function is a good idea. I agree it should be called `expit`, both for consistency with scipy, and because as you say, `sigmoid` really just means an S shaped function.

Testability,"Ready for another look. I had to modify the classes some to make it work, particularly for getting the `type` out of the test. Now the type is with the Test rather than the TestResult, perhaps you see a better way?. Related notes, mostly relevant to future PRs once we have some feedback and a sense of performance:. I think LogisticRegressionNullFit should be a separate class, as it plays a conceptually and practically different role. I don't want to attach vectors of length nSamples (like mu) to each LogisticRegressionFit output, even though they would speed up the score test and first iteration of fitting per variant to not recompute them for every variant. I did put some of this efficiency in the score test (only computing the extra coordinate of score and row / column of fisher per variant). df would also then go away for LogisticRegressionFit, but I'd add the diagonal of its inverse for use in Wald (see below). The model fit function would then take a LogisticRegressionNullFit to use in the first iteration. The bigger future gains will come from not computing or inverting the Fisher matrix at all in the iteration, but rather using QR magic. val sqrtW = sqrt(mu :\* (1d - mu)); val QR = qr.reduced(X(::, _) :_ sqrtW); solve QR.R \* deltaB = QR.Q.t \* (y - mu) with R upper triangular (need to wrap lapack function). for Wald: return diagonal of inverse as well, namely diagonal of inv(R)^T \* inv(R), rather than inverting fisher again. for Score, this version of this may be faster:; val sqrtW = sqrt(mu :\* (1d - mu)); val Qty0 = qr.reduced.justQ(X(::, _) :_ sqrtW).t \* ((y - mu) :/ sqrtW); val chi2 = Qty0 dot Qty0. for Firth, modify score using:; val QQ = QR.Q :\* QR.Q; val h = sum(QQ(*, ::))",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/585#issuecomment-241153168:121,test,test,121,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/585#issuecomment-241153168,3,['test'],['test']

Testability,"So I think the root issue here is the unnecessary duplication between `pyRegisterIR` and `pyRegisterIRForServiceBackend`. The only real difference is that one takes and already parsed IR, and the other takes a string and calls the parser. The callers of `pyRegisterIR` in python all call into the parser first, but I don't see any reason it has to make two calls across the python/scala bridge; I think `pyRegisterIR` should just take the IR as a string and call the parser like `pyRegisterIRForServiceBackend` does. With that change, it should be possible to make one a simple wrapper around the other (or maybe even get rid of `pyRegisterIRForServiceBackend` completely).

Testability,"Thanks @danking for helping with this, and for the nudge to finally get it implemented!. Some more next steps:; * Make a benchmarking setup to collect data on performance and accuracy. I want to use the same metrics for measuring error as [here](http://quantiles.github.io/) (Kolmogorov-Smirnov divergence and total variation distance between the true and estimated CDFs, which are both simple to compute). As a first sanity check, we should get numbers in the same ballpark as they did (worse at first, because we started with a very naive algorithm).; * Make improvements to the algorithm, evaluating the gains in the benchmarks.; * When we feel we understand the behavior of the accuracy measures, we can pick a conservative upper error bound and turn that into an automated test.; * Also once we understand the behavior of the accuracy measures, figure out how to communicate that to users. One thought is to offer a few default choices of parameters, and for each document memory usage, empirical error from our benchmarks, and a theoretical upper bound on the error (of the form ""with probability > .99 the estimated q quantile element will have true quantile q Â± .001""). This allows users to make an informed decision based on their use case. That looks like a lot, but I think those are all relatively simple.

It's no longer in the location from which we import it. We must get it from some other dependency. OK. So, before my simplification of build.gradle, we used a configuration called `compile` and another one called `testCompile`. [Neither of those exist in modern gradle, apparently](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_library_plugin.html#sec:java_library_configurations_graph).

For reference, running an IntelliJ test that simply generates the integer matrix of genotypes for 10k samples and 10k variants and 4 populations with the rest default takes about 7 seconds (one core).

Testability,"The problem I saw was this:. ToStream's invariant is that its children must be TIterable. Given this invariant, in boundary it is not safe to call ToArray on streamified when streamified.isInstanceOf[TStream] and node.typ.isInstanceOf[TArray], because this will miss cases (potentially) when node is a different TIterable, and likewise it is not safe to call ToArray on streamified when node.typ.isInstanceOf[TIterable], because we may inadvertently cast a non-array TIterable to TArray, and thereby break boundary's type invariance. So everywhere that we add a ToStream, we need to perform a check on the child: if it's a non-TArray TIterable, return it, else wrap in ToArray, unless we can be sure we never perform said wrap on a TIterable when streamify is called from boundary. . In the latest commit, I simplified the toStream code, and improved the type check to check not TContainer, but (TIterable && !TStream). This is more precise that checking TContainer alone. That being said I haven't created a convincing test yet (though it's trivially easy to make *a* test: pass a ToStream wrapping a node with typ TDict to boundary, with the old check on boundary, and a TIterable check-before-wrap-in-ToStream in the base case of streamify).

Testability,"This is caused by domain-by-domain CSRF tokens introduced in [#14180](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/14180). An unfortunate side effect is that the tokens available on non-auth pages are no longer able to validate requests to the auth/logout API. Given the lack of apparent noise about this bug in our issues and zulip I suspect that this is not a common path for users, and that a fix along the lines of ""require add one button click to go to the User page first before logging out is acceptable"". On the other hand, the risk of a user clicking on the broken Logout button and believing themselves to be logged out when seeing a `401: Unauthorized` page (but actually still having logged-in state in their browser) raises this in my mind to a security bug rather than just a UX bug or an unfortunate user experience.

To make the smallest number of potentially risky changes to the underlying security architecture; 4.

Testability,"a simpler solution which was attractive because the microservices are looking more and more like services and less like web servers (even more so moving all the rendering to the front end with the web app, the legacy version of scorecard using jinja is not the representative case). Did you look at aiohttp?; > * From the code:; > > Global variables that are modified ...; > ; > ; > I don't want to have to think about shared state and locking. I want a shared-nothing architecture in the microservices where the only globals are true constants and threads communication by sending immutable data through queues.; > * Finally, a meta-comment. I started reviewing this when it was just ujson, I did a bit of research about json packages to understand your choices and when I came back, the PR had expanded with all the async stuff. I would have approved the ujson stuff. The async stuff could have been a separate PR. Nobody wants to review a moving target, so the scope of a change should be roughly frozen when you assign a PR and additional changes should be minimized and restricted to that scope. You're welcome to have an open PR with no reviewer if you're still fleshing out the scope, of course. Thanks!. In response:. 1) aiohttp is an option, but appears to be generally considered slow on a per-response basis (published benchmarks, haven't had a chance to try it), even potentially slower than flask. It seems wrong to choose something slower if there are are reasonable alternatives.; 2) The globals were a feature of the initial implementation (the GitHub cache). It felt outside of the scope of my PR to change that to some queue solution. Meta comment. Ok. I didn't think it had been looked at, and expanded what it did pretty quickly, as I realized that ujson wasn't helping much. I can make a ujson-specific pr, but my goal was to test async library implementations in a simple applications, since we need a long term strategy for python web stuff that isn't Flask (or not just Flask)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461191051:1558,benchmark,benchmarks,1558,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461191051,2,"['benchmark', 'test']","['benchmarks', 'test']"

Testability,"d about the long-term health of the project. https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2902. In the second branch related to this pull request, linked above, I chose Starlette, and it is a thin abstraction, nearly identical performance, over Uvicorn + httptools, which were both written by Yury Selivanov, the asyncio person I mention above. Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 . Starlette is something like base Go performance (though 1/5-1/10th the performance of Go's fasthttp library for simple responses, and much closer for anything involving database calls). Sanic also uses httptools and uvloop, but has more stuff.. so yeah maybe a bit slower than Starlette, or not, but the diff will probably be small. Regarding the benchmark you linked, it is benchmarking the power of sleep. There is something deeply wrong with their results. Sanic has 1800 timeouts, vs 200 for aiohttp, and 3x the connection errors. Fine, so Sanic is super slow. But look at their non-db tests. Sanic is >2x as fast, 0 timeouts. They aren't using anything Sanic specific to query the database, and both use the same event loop. Adding asyncio Postgres to two programs that fundamentally differ mainly in how the handle http requests and responses, shows the one that is faster at http requests/responses (Sanic) becoming much slower, and in fact reversing its relationship to Aiohttp. This is strange to say the least. I was really curious about this, so I ran the bench. First, I upgraded Sanic to a recent version. Then I ran their test. In short, their results were not what I found. Sanic is 50% faster, and the timeouts are what you'd expect. 26 timeouts for Sanic, 45 for aiohttp.

Testability,"e any of the hard problems (whereas shared_ptr; very much does). Now I realize that people writing books about C++ write a good deal about move semantics and; unique_ptr. My interpretation is that there's a lot of writing about it because it involves concepts; which simply don't occur in any other commonly-used languages, and as such it requires a; good deal of explanation and justification because it's peculiar and unfamiliar. I suggest that; other languages haven't invented this concept because it's a) confusing and b) not particularly; useful. There's one really good thing you get from move semantics: the ability to resize a std::vector<T>; or std::unordered_map<T> without constructing deep copies of each T object. In the cases; where that's useful, it's very useful for optimizing performance without totally bypassing all your; abstraction mechanisms. The other ways people attempt to exploit move semantics are IMO; just a bad idea: if you want to pass around a large expensive-to-create object, then do it the; Java way by putting it on the heap and passing around some kind of reference, and *everyone* can understand it, not just experts in modern C++. Another angle on this debate would be to look at some open-source C++ projects and see how; often they actually use unique_ptr and/or std::move. My guess is that it's much less common; in practice than you might think from reading books about C++, because the overlap between; ""object ownership is passed around"" and ""... but we always know precisely who has ownership""; is not a very big part of the design space - compared to a whole lot of ""always owned by the object which created it"" and ""used in several places at once and we don't know who will be the last to drop it"". [Update: the LLVM codebase, including tests, is 2.00M lines of C++ (.h and .cpp files), of which; ""unique_ptr"" occurs 4500 times, and ""std::move"" 3558 times. That's a ""unique_ptr"" on average once every 444 lines, and ""std::move"" once every 562 lines.]",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3718#issuecomment-396683489:2030,test,tests,2030,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3718#issuecomment-396683489,1,['test'],['tests']
Testability,"e may be to increase `read_timeout` past 120 seconds, although depending on the causes of this issue, that may not eliminate the problem, and of course leaves a long delay, which may be unacceptable for the use-case. As for why read takes so long: not 100% sure yet, setting up batch and CI is still incomplete, and I have not triggered this error myself. My guess is that Kubernetes takes too long to generate the response, either due to garbage collection, or simply because the requested information takes N > 120 seconds to return. That would be a very long time for any reasonable response, so either the resource isn't ready and it waits, or there are network connectivity issues. If network issues, not sure what solutions are.

As for writing LLVM IR, it can definitely be done, because that's what Endeca/Oracle did. But there; was such a huge learning curve that only 3 people ever did it successfully (I wasn't one of them),; and debugging seemed very unpleasant and slow.

Not claiming that part of it is difficult,; just that it didn't happen at Oracle until long after I left. In contrast, at PhysicsSpeed it was fairly smooth to implement nice abstractions (dense-join-table,; hash-join-table, tuple-with-order) as template classes which could be tested and debugged; in a standalone environment, and then have simpler codegen using those abstractions. At least,; that's a good way to get a lot of functionality with modest effort - and it doesn't preclude migrating; towards a more complex codegen later.

And in that case the re-use; would give hits on some stages. The plan is not really to aim at structuring things to get a; high level of re-use, but just to opportunistically exploit re-use which happens to occur -; e.g. if the early stages of an analysis involve reading an existing file and filtering in various; ways, then that may not be changed at all by changes to what happen in the real analysis; after the filtering. And this is also influenced by the medium-term goal of having a Hail service; which (amongst other things) can do simple analyses on small data in under ten seconds - in; that realm compilation time could become a critical factor as a serial bottleneck. [The place where persistent cacheing of compiled files helps most of all is in testing,; where you really are running the exact same queries over and over again on the same; small datasets, and in many cases after making small changes which only affect a few; of the queries]. b) We may actually have some version of the locking problem even if we don't try to reuse the files -; since we have several workers on a node, and possibly a master as well, all needing to put code; into a file (or wait for someone else to populate the file) so that they can load it.

Testability,"h the recur and the break expressions) the type `Bottom`. `Bottom` is the empty type, so there can be no closed expressions of type `Bottom`. In the type checker, `Bottom` is only allowed to appear in tail positions, and for `If`, we keep the rule that both branches must have the same type, so either both branches are `Bottom` or neither are. This keeps the semantics simple: an if statement either makes a value or it jumps away, there's no confusing mix. One nice property of this setup is that if an expression has a non-bottom type, then it is guaranteed not to jump away from itself (it may jump internally), so it is safe to method-wrap. This also make codegen very simple, and @iitalics has already implemented it! See `JoinPoint` and `JoinPoint.CallCC`. In the IR, I don't think this requires much change. If we're already adding a continuation context (as mentioned above), then `TailLoop` just needs to bind both a recur and a break continuation, where recur takes the loop variable types, and break takes the loop result type. Then `Recur` can be replaced by a `Jump` node which calls (jumps to) a continuation in context. There's also a middle ground where we make break continuations explicit in the IR, but we want to keep the scheme-like interface in python. Then the pass @cseed described for inferring where the loop exits are would just go in python instead of the emitter. > Using the stream interface seems wrong to me also. When I mentioned this, I was thinking we could reuse the region management logic from the stream emitter for loops, but I've since changed my mind. I think loops will have hard region management no matter what. > What's the type of the stream the loop turns into? Since loops carry multiple values (by design), memory allocating these to create a tuple stream is going to be a performance non-starter. As a side note, @iitalics stream emitter can handle streams of multiple values fine. Effectively, you can make a `Stream[(Code[A], Code[B], Code[C])]`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7614#issuecomment-559072407:3141,log,logic,3141,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7614#issuecomment-559072407,1,['log'],['logic']
Testability,"hat seems like a good spot to me from a developer ergonomics perspective:; - O(trusts) modifications necessary to update/revoke the cert; - O(1) configuration to load a trust list; - no pod-start-time configuration; - the trust list is on the container's file system, so its easy to inspect. Small point: I don't pin the incoming certs yet due to the mTLS challenges. ### create on each deploy. Only creating certs if they don't exist is an easy change. Seems fine, though leaves unresolved how to rotate the certs. I guess I'm inclined to always recreate because it makes rotation the common case, forcing us to make it work well. I think the only way to do a no-downtime rotation is:; 1. create fresh certs; 2. create the trust lists including a principal's fresh cert and previous generation cert; 3. update all the secrets; 4. somehow ensure everyone has the latest secrets?; 5. notify all servers to refresh their certificates (nginx: send SIGHUP, aiohttp: we have to write something). We could stick a generation uuid in the secrets and keep refreshing services until the certificate uuid they read is the one our deploy expects. ### mTLS. This PR will land. Things will break because the unmanaged services (router-resolver, gateway, internal-gateway) do not speak TLS. I'll manually deploy them. The default namespace and new PR namespaces should now function properly. Developers will need to redeploy from master. With this in place, I will make another PR with two main changes:; - enable client verification, and; - modify create_certs.py to load the unmanaged certificates from `default` rather than the local namespace.; That PR should pass all the tests (batch pods will speak TLS to internal-gateway; internal-gateway will speak TLS to PR batch using a client certificate PR batch trusts; etc.).

Testability,"ng in person what makes the most sense for 0.1. Here are the pieces I think we should separate for devel, though we could consider providing a meta-interface as well that combines some of them for usability. I'm writing (U, S, L) for a local matrix of eigenvectors U, an array of eigenvalues S, and an array of labels L on the rows of U (as with labels for SymmetricMatrix). 1) VDS to a (labeled) symmetric matrix (we have these: GRM, RRM, LD matrix, and Dan is working on a way to read and write them). 2) Symmetric matrix to (U, S, L), which we'll want to write and read. This modularizes the single-core eigen-decomposition bottleneck. 3) Variant-labeled (V, S, L) and VDS with those variants to transport (V, S, L) to sample-labeled (U, S, L). Currently this also requires knowing the number of samples used to make the LDMatrix since that number is used in its normalization. I agree it feels unnatural to need to remember this; to avoid it we'd need an unnormalized version. 4) Sample-labeled (U, S, L) and VDS to global fit of LMM including delta. This is currently a local computation that's been pretty fast in practice but as sample sizes increase we will want to distribute evaluating many values of delta in parallel. Note this step only uses the sample annotations on the VDS, so logically it could also be on KeyTable (which would be the sample KeyTable of the VDS). 5) Sample-labeled (U, S, L), VDS, and delta to per-variant-fit of LMM. This VDS can now contain exactly the variants one wants to fit. (5) should eventually be decomposed as well. The first command should project from Matrix to Matrix (projecting both numeric cells and a list of numeric sample annotations) and some additional small data. Then (6) will do per variant tests starting from after this projection (that is, after what is the BIG computation when you have tens of millions of variants). That way users can quickly iterate on exploration of covariates, fine mapping, and so on, for any fixed set of samples.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/1984#issuecomment-319971210:1395,log,logically,1395,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/1984#issuecomment-319971210,2,"['log', 'test']","['logically', 'tests']"

Same needs to be done for VDS, this isn't too hard); - Add the non-core methods to `hail.methods` / `hail.genetics.methods`; - some stuff here is much harder than the rest, like `filter_alleles`; - This is mostly just labor, but some require more thought than others, like moving TDT to use hail2 expr; - Support intervals in the `index_*` methods. It's possible now to join by locus, but not using the `annotateLociTable` fast path.; - Move to Python 3 so argument order is preserved; - Test the hail2 api much more rigorously than we do now (at the very least, call each parameter branch for each method!; - Typecheck the expression language. This isn't super trivial, and making a nice system to integrate our `typecheck` module and expressions will require some thoughtful design work.; - Some more organization around the package: monkey patching with `import hail.genetics` is an idea I like, but want to think about the edge cases first. ## Documentation; - Document the `index_*` methods / joins; - Translate the _Hail Overview_ tutorial; - Make new tutorials to replace the 2 expr ones we have; - Fill in docs on api2 methods (they're not all there yet); - Fill in docs on expression language (things like __mul__ on NumericExpression haven't been documented); - Write ""integrative docs"" that provide how-tos for common types of workflows. Show the power of annotate / select / group_by/aggregate, etc. ## Longer term QoL:; - Move over tests to Python as much as possible. I looked at the linear regression suite and it can be moved entirely into Python without many problems.; - Write a type parser in Python. The nested calls into the JVM for Type._from_java make the library feel extremely sluggish on teensy data.; - Integrate RV with C/C++, so we can transmit data much more efficiently between Python and Java.; - Rethink the expr language function registry, because many functions there can be implemented in terms of others in Python.; - add back in de novo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/2588#issuecomment-352190554:1737,test,tests,1737,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/2588#issuecomment-352190554,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"rly identical performance, over Uvicorn + httptools, which were both written by Yury Selivanov, the asyncio person I mention above. Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 . Starlette is something like base Go performance (though 1/5-1/10th the performance of Go's fasthttp library for simple responses, and much closer for anything involving database calls). Sanic also uses httptools and uvloop, but has more stuff.. so yeah maybe a bit slower than Starlette, or not, but the diff will probably be small. Regarding the benchmark you linked, it is benchmarking the power of sleep. There is something deeply wrong with their results. Sanic has 1800 timeouts, vs 200 for aiohttp, and 3x the connection errors. Fine, so Sanic is super slow. But look at their non-db tests. Sanic is >2x as fast, 0 timeouts. They aren't using anything Sanic specific to query the database, and both use the same event loop. Adding asyncio Postgres to two programs that fundamentally differ mainly in how the handle http requests and responses, shows the one that is faster at http requests/responses (Sanic) becoming much slower, and in fact reversing its relationship to Aiohttp. This is strange to say the least. I was really curious about this, so I ran the bench. First, I upgraded Sanic to a recent version. Then I ran their test. In short, their results were not what I found. Sanic is 50% faster, and the timeouts are what you'd expect. 26 timeouts for Sanic, 45 for aiohttp.

Testability,"s would be great. My current thoughts on this:. I only looked at the failure in PCA. I was never able to reproduce. My next step to try to reproduce was to run PCA on Lindo's full dataset on dataproc (can't use batch because the error is in spark PCA). I did look carefully through the stack trace, trying to understand what could possibly be happening. The number 177860 from the error isn't either matrix dimension, which is 210234 by 8893. Everything in `org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.EigenValueDecomposition$.symmetricEigs(EigenValueDecomposition.scala:106)` is independent of the number of rows, so only the number 8893 of cols should be relevent. I wrote a simple test to execute spark PCA with 8893 rows in scala, so I could step through with a debugger:; ```scala; var mt = rangeMatrix(10000, 8893); mt = MatrixMapEntries(mt, InsertFields(Ref(""g"", mt.typ.entryType), Seq(""a"" -> F64(1)))); val t = MatrixToTableApply(mt, PCA(""a"", 10, false)); val n = TableToValueApply(t, ForceCountTable()); assertEvalsTo(n, 8893L); ```; The array `v` in `symmetricEigs` has length 177860 = 8893*20, and I didn't find anything else with that size. The only line I could find that could generate an exception that looks like this is line 555 of `dev.ludovic.netlib.arpack.AbstractARPACK.dsaupd`; ```scala; public void dsaupd(org.netlib.util.intW ido, String bmat, int n, String which, int nev, org.netlib.util.doubleW tol, double[] resid, int offsetresid, int ncv, double[] v, int offsetv, int ldv, int[] iparam, int offsetiparam, int[] ipntr, int offsetipntr, double[] workd, int offsetworkd, double[] workl, int offsetworkl, int lworkl, org.netlib.util.intW info) {; if (debug) System.err.println(""dsaupd"");; checkArgument(""DSAUPD"", 2, lsame(""I"", bmat) || lsame(""G"", bmat));; checkArgument(""DSAUPD"", 3, n >= 0);; checkArgument(""DSAUPD"", 4, lsame(""LA"", which) || lsame(""SA"", which) || lsame(""LM"", which) || lsame(""SM"", which) || lsame(""BE"", which));; checkArgument(""DSAUPD"", 5, 0 < nev && nev < n);; checkArgum",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13688#issuecomment-1760360313:1025,assert,assertEvalsTo,1025,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13688#issuecomment-1760360313,1,['assert'],['assertEvalsTo']

Testability,"specific Hail Query functionality, let's mirror that structure. Let's move REGENIE and any non-Python dependencies of it into `hailtop/batch/genetics/regenie`. Sure. > How is the Dockerfile meant to be used? As written it doesn't appear that it would work because there doesn't exist any regenie source code to COPY in. It's meant to create a Regenie docker image that we could use. It's a copy of the regenie c++ repo's dockerfile, with the removal of the ENTRYPOINT /usr/local/bin/regenie, so that I could issue a command that included an executable, which is convenient to give me the ability to check that intermediate files are actually created (wc, ls) by batch, and because that seems more idiomatic for batch. I don't think there is a published regenie image, but docker hub is down so can't double check. . You're right, I shouldn't have deleted the bulk of the repo, kept as is. Didn't want to deal with submodules. > I've made some other in-line comments in the python file. It's not clear to me how all those other files are related to the python files and I'm a bit uncomfortable adding a whole directory with a LICENSE file, especially when not all the files in the directory fall under that license (e.g. the regenie py file) and moreover the license makes claims about things linking to BGEN, which none of our code here does. The license is only contained within the folder with the licensed files. In a previous conversation with Nate/Cotton, if we use any open-source software, best to keep those files segregated, alongside their license (license must be kept alongside the code, easier to see the demarcation if in a separate folder). > We have some BGEN files for testing in the Hail src/test/resources.

Testability,"te about the `compile` configuration [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/building_java_projects.html#sec:java_dependency_management_overview) (search for ""compile""):. > **Why no compile configuration?**; > The Java Library Plugin has historically used the compile configuration for dependencies that are required to both compile and run a projectâ€™s production code. It is now deprecated, and will issue warnings when used, because it doesnâ€™t distinguish between dependencies that impact the public API of a Java library project and those that donâ€™t. You can learn more about the importance of this distinction in [Building Java libraries](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/building_java_projects.html#sec:building_java_libraries). OK, so, we used to just dump everything into our runtime dependencies. I changed it so that we have three kinds of dependencies:; 1. `shadow`: these are provided by Dataproc/QoB at run-time. They are not in any JAR. They are not on the `testRuntimeClasspath` or `runtimeClasspath`. They are on the `testCompileClasspath` because I [explicitly requested](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/main/hail/build.gradle#L98) that `testCompileOnly` bring in our `shadow` dependencies.; 2. `implementation`: these are included in all class paths and in shadow JARs (but not ""thin"" jars generated by `./gradlew jar`).; 3. `testImplementation`: these are included in test class paths and in shadow JARs.

There's three exceptions there (all the same one). The deepest one came during a write. The next two came during closes. The outermost exception is from the `using` cleaning up. I'm not sure where the middle exception comes from, I can't imagine who would try to `close` the stream other than `using`. Regardless, it appears that the upload fails in some unrecoverable way. We're writing 2GiB in 256 8MiB chunks in this test, so we have more chances for something to go wrong.

Testability,"u linked, it is benchmarking the power of sleep. There is something deeply wrong with their results. Sanic has 1800 timeouts, vs 200 for aiohttp, and 3x the connection errors. Fine, so Sanic is super slow. But look at their non-db tests. Sanic is >2x as fast, 0 timeouts. They aren't using anything Sanic specific to query the database, and both use the same event loop. Adding asyncio Postgres to two programs that fundamentally differ mainly in how the handle http requests and responses, shows the one that is faster at http requests/responses (Sanic) becoming much slower, and in fact reversing its relationship to Aiohttp. This is strange to say the least. I was really curious about this, so I ran the bench. First, I upgraded Sanic to a recent version. Then I ran their test. In short, their results were not what I found. Sanic is 50% faster, and the timeouts are what you'd expect. 26 timeouts for Sanic, 45 for aiohttp.

Testability,"ve summary. Excess JVM memory use is almost certainly not the issue. I've taken a close look at the import_gvs.py loop and the related Hail Python code. No obvious accumulation of RAM use. AFAICT, the oomkiller keeps killing the pipelines. We need to stop this because the oomkiller (a) acts before the JVM GC can free things and (b) prevents us from getting JVM diagnostics on failure. We control the JVM's max heap with hailctl's --master-memory-fraction (default is 0.8 for 80% of the master machine type's advertised RAM). I suggest we set this down to 0.6 and continue using an n1-highmem-16 driver.; If Hail is (incorrectly) accumulating garbage memory per-group, we'll have a better chance diagnosing that with a running JVM instead of one that's been SIGKILL'ed. To understand what's going on, we gotta see what is using RAM in the n1-highmem-16 case. If I could SSH to the cluster, a simple solution is a screen with top -s 300 -n 100 >memory.log (I'd guess no more than 500KiB per hour of logs) and retrieve that file if the cluster fails. If we could get Google Monitoring set up to retrieve process-level memory statistics from the driver node that should also work. Just to be clear, I don't anticipate any changes to Hail in the next week that would change the memory use of this pipeline. There could be a memory leak, but I have no clews that lead to it. I realize this is an unsatisfying answer. I'm pretty perplexed as to what could be the issue here. #### technical details. We'll call the second to most recent run Run A and the most recent run Run B. Run A (like all runs before it) only manages two sample groups before failing. Run B made it through 50 groups before failing on 51. Why did they fail? The syslog for Run A is clear: the oomkiller killed Run A. We lack syslogs for Run B, so we cannot be certain but the lack of a JVM stack trace suggests to me that (a) the driver failed and (b) the driver was killed by the system.; Let's focus on the driver machines.

Usability," between them. The caller owns the widget, and the lifetime of `bar` is nested inside that of its caller, so lifetime management isn't an issue.; * If `bar` takes a `Widget` and needs to take ownership, it should take its argument as a `unique_ptr<Widget>`. This serves as documentation that the function is taking over responsibility for deleting the Widget, in a way enforced by the compiler.; * A `unique_ptr<Widget>*` or `unique_ptr<Widget>&` is an in-out parameter, where the function needs to be able to point the pointer somewhere else.; * A const pointer or reference to a unique_ptr should never be used. Just pass a raw pointer or reference. Essentially the same rubric should be used for shared_ptr, replacing ""take ownership"" with ""share ownership"". If a function is simply using a value and isn't concerned with its lifetime management, it should be taking a raw pointer or reference, not a shared_ptr. It should be completely agnostic what method the caller is using to manage the lifetime of the object. Herb Sutter gives his typical thorough analysis of this question [here](https://herbsutter.com/2013/06/05/gotw-91-solution-smart-pointer-parameters/). > I would be fine with that extra learning curve and complexity if unique_ptr solved a difficult; problem. But - by definition! - it doesn't. It only works for the easy case where you have one; pointer to each object. The invariant that unique_ptr is designed to keep isn't that there is only one pointer to each object. There can be any number of aliases, changing over time, but at any time exactly one must be a unique_ptr, which documents which alias is the ""owner"". The design of and idioms around unique_ptr ensure that all non-owning aliases have lifetimes which are nested inside the lifetime of the owning pointer, and that ownership can be passed around unambiguously.

I'm already nervous long-term about the latency of the C++ compiler overhead and if I'm being honest would prefer to generate LLVM IR directly into memory. We should ship whatever compiler is best on the cloud and in the download package. That already covers a vast majority of our users. If clang is the clear winner, we can make that clear in the documentation and maybe warn about gcc it on startup. > But that becomes a problem in itself if we want the shipped compiler to work on a variety of OS'es.

Usability," simple hash-based cache: no need to walk complex graph to normalize cache, because in most cases I'm perfectly fine with not re-using cache across different queries (that may have some shared fields). Apollo does something ""smarter"", but much slower: walks a query, checks that the requested fields for a node are the same, and that the node's id is the same, as some other query. 2) no runtime validation of query shape via graphql-tag...uses simple template strings, which are free. We don't care about schema validation in the client...because the server will error when schema is invalid. This should be compile time validated instead, in this case via integration tests. Also removed react-icons... I was going to use this in place of material-design-icons, because I thought loading the full font, when I needed only a few icons, would be unnecessarily expensive. It turns out that I cannot find a library where a single icon import (react-icons or MaterialUI) is smaller than Google's entire material design font: a single font (there are several needed to cover all icons) is ~500B. A single react-icons icon is ~2KB on dev (production may be smaller due to tree shaking). Also, am opposed to CSS-in-JS: slower, worse tooling, larger. Benefits are dynamic selectors, which are really no advantage that I can see (without them can still dynamically apply classes, as in the yee ol days of pleb vanilla js).

Usability," simplify the computation of the principal components. First let me summarize how the paper presents PC-AiR. ### Original Presentation. Suppose that there are $n_u$ individuals in the unrelated set and $p$ SNPs. Let $X$ be the $n_u \times p$ standardized genotype matrix for the unrelated individuals. The paper starts by computing. $$\Psi \coloneqq \frac{1}{p}XX^T.$$. Next the paper eigendecomposes $\Psi$:. $$\Psi = U \Sigma^2 U^T,$$. where $U$ are the eigenvectors and $\Sigma^2$ is the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues along the diagonal. Then the paper computes a $p \times n$ matrix $W$ called the **SNP weight matrix**:. $$W \coloneqq X^T U.$$. Suppose that there are $n_r$ individuals in the related set and let $Y$ be the $n_r \times p$ standardized genotype matrix for the related individuals. The paper computes the principal components associated with the related samples with. $$ \frac{1}{p} Y W (\Sigma^2)^{-1}.$$. ### Simplifications. The first simplification that I noticed is that we can do away with the $\frac{1}{p}$ terms. Because $\Psi$ is scaled by $p^{-1}$, the inverse of the eigenvalues, $(\Sigma^2)^{-1}$ is scaled by $p$, which cancels out the $1/p$ term in the calculation of the principal components for the related individuals. From here on, let us redefine $\Sigma^2$ as the diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of $XX^T$ (not $\frac{1}{p} XX^T$). Next, by examining the relationship between singular value decomposition (SVD) and eigendecomposition ([Wikipedia link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition#Relation_to_eigenvalue_decomposition)), I realized that it is not necessary to compute $\Psi$. Instead, we can get $U$ and $\Sigma$ from the SVD of $X$:. $$X = U\Sigma V^T,$$. where $V$ is a $p \times p$ basis of the new PCA coordinate space. Then while investigating the meaning of $W$, I realized that $W = X^T U = V \Sigma^T U^T U = V \Sigma^T$. Taking these simplifications into account, I realized that the paper is, in essen",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14326#issuecomment-1962279184:978,simpl,simplification,978,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14326#issuecomment-1962279184,1,['simpl'],['simplification']

Usability,"""the implementations should rely directly on java.util.Random"" Umm, why? From my outsiders perspective I would have assumed that high quality software worked on by the Broad Institute would use a half decent Random Number Generator (RNG). . If I had time to spend on this I would be pushing to change it to something else, perhaps the Apache Commons RNG: commons.apache.org/proper/commons-rng/userguide/rng.html I'm not a Java programmer though, and don't really aspire to be. . The C++ standard rand() function is also well known to be quite bad, though C++11 distributions use an ok implementation (I think default is Mersenne Twister, but there are also other options http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random). In some C code I was replacing rand() and found this nice library: http://www.pcg-random.org/ no Java implementation though http://www.pcg-random.org/download.html#java-implementation T.T, but the PCG algorithm is actually really simple to implement. The PCG site is worth exploring in general to understand the important differences between RNGs. The GNU Scientific Library also provides C/C++ coders with some RNG implementations https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Random-Number-Generation.html . I realize that it is quite early in development (in terms of versioning, 0.2) so maybe this seems like an insignificant thing, but I also hear that it is actively being used, so.... it also may not matter much, I just would like to bring some attention to it in case it hasn't been considered because I know that the RNG is something that is frequently overlooked.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/2314#issuecomment-384085976:951,simpl,simple,951,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/2314#issuecomment-384085976,1,['simpl'],['simple']

Because $\Psi$ is scaled by $p^{-1}$, the inverse of the eigenvalues, $(\Sigma^2)^{-1}$ is scaled by $p$, which cancels out the $1/p$ term in the calculation of the principal components for the related individuals. From here on, let us redefine $\Sigma^2$ as the diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of $XX^T$ (not $\frac{1}{p} XX^T$). Next, by examining the relationship between singular value decomposition (SVD) and eigendecomposition ([Wikipedia link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition#Relation_to_eigenvalue_decomposition)), I realized that it is not necessary to compute $\Psi$. Instead, we can get $U$ and $\Sigma$ from the SVD of $X$:. $$X = U\Sigma V^T,$$. where $V$ is a $p \times p$ basis of the new PCA coordinate space. Then while investigating the meaning of $W$, I realized that $W = X^T U = V \Sigma^T U^T U = V \Sigma^T$. Taking these simplifications into account, I realized that the paper is, in essence, computing $Y V$ to get the predicted scores associated with the related individuals. (Technically, I think that the paper is computing $Y V \Sigma^{-1}$. I am not sure why they scale the columns by the reciprocal of the eigenvalues here.). ### Simplified Approach. As I understand it, $V$ is a change-of-basis matrix from the original coordinates to the PCA scores. Letting $G$ denote the full standardized genotype matrix of all the individuals, I think we can just return $GV$, where $V$ is defined by the SVD of $X$:. $$X = U\Sigma V^T.$$",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14326#issuecomment-1962279184:1946,simpl,simplifications,1946,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/14326#issuecomment-1962279184,1,['simpl'],['simplifications']

Usability,"1. For runImage steps, you can only copy out-of or copy into `/io` (the reasoning is a bit complicated and somewhat historical).; 2. For buildImage steps, you can copy out-of or copy into `/`; 3. the `to` of an `output` specifies a file path in a ""filesystem"" that another step can access if it `dependsOn` the outputting step; 4. the `from` of an `input` specifies a file path in the aforementioned ""filesystem""; the filesystem contains all `outputs` from steps in the inputting step's `dependsOn` clause. We also have a `docker/Makefile` which is an emergency manual build system. I update that so that `hail_version` appears in the root of the docker context. The `service-base` uses the entire repository as its docker context, so I place hail_version at the root of the repository. I moved the `version` function from `hailtop.hailctl` into `hailtop`. It seems broadly useful and isn't specific to hailctl in anyway. Your concern about loading from pkg_resources repeated seems well-founded, so I went ahead and loaded the hail_version at package import time. This seems likely to ensure we learn about a missing hail_version file as early as possible (presumably at service start-time). This also means all hailtop installs need a hail_version file. I only found two other places that use hailtop. One of them was a completely unused Dockerfile. I deleted that (`Dockerfile.hailtop`). The other was Dockerfile.ci-test, which I updated to copy the hail_version file just like service-base. https://github.com/hail-is/hail/compare/main...danking:add-version-endpoint.

Usability,"1. Functionally, it's already possible -- should be able to do `vds.annotate_variants_db('va.dann')` and get the `va.dann.score` annotation in your VDS. Taking a step further, you can even do `vds.annotate_variants_db('va')` and get all of the annotations. It's just a matter of designing the query builder to encourage people using the function in whatever way we think is optimal, I suppose. What are the downsides to carrying around a lot of annotations in a VDS? I worry that if we supplied a select-all `va` option, everybody would just use that -- but if there aren't any major drawbacks, maybe that's the way to go and we don't even really need a query builder. Or maybe just allowing top-level selections like `va.dann`, `va.chromHMM`, etc. would be a good intermediate solution. 2. Yes! I'd definitely be interested in working on a Scala implementation, if one of you would be willing to work with a newbie :). Though I think if we can get this Python version working & usable first, that may be best. 3. I'll look into this. I don't have a solution yet.

Usability,"1. I really don't understand what this code is trying to do. Can you give me a short explanation in English?. 2. I think you just need single-use Let forwarding to optimize this. It looks like:. Push down the TableCount. (TableCount (Paralellelize ...)) should turn into (ArrayLen (GetField rows ...)). Push the ArrayLen/GetField into the Let. (Is this what your ""MaximizeLets"" is doing? I think that would traditionally be called let lifting.). Now you have (Let __cols_and_globals (ArrayLen (GetField __cols (Ref __cols_and_globals))). Then you forward the single-use Let, and the rest of the code simplifies into (ArrayLen (TableCollect (TableRead ""cols""))), and that should have the static number of rows and be able to be simplified. 3. So how should single-use Let forwarding work? You need two things: to determine there is only one use, and that the single use isn't in a more expensive context, e.g. you don't want to forward a single-use Let into a loop: (Let expensive X (ArrayMap a x <use expensive once>)). Since our control flow is structured, there is a static notion of ""loop nesting depth"", e.g. in the above code, the Let has nesting depth 0, and the use in the ArrayMap body has nesting depth 1. You can only forward into the same nesting depth. 4. Final question is, do you want the let forwarding pass to also delete unused Lets? If you delete a let, that might delete references that make other lets single (or zero) use. In this case, it might be nice to build a ""use-def chain"" data structure, that keeps, for each let, its list of uses (and vice versa). Then, when you delete a Let, you can dynamically delete the references for the right hand side, possibly creating additional optimization opportunities.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5041#issuecomment-452863737:600,simpl,simplifies,600,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5041#issuecomment-452863737,2,['simpl'],"['simplified', 'simplifies']"

Usability,"> Ah sorry, I forgot to update the original commit message as that's not actually correct. The optimization is that we don't need to iterate through all blobs until we find the exact blob matching our path name. The list operation returns all blobs that start with the prefix of that path. If we see a blob with a different name that is a child of our path f'{path}/foo, then we know it's a directory and don't need to iterate anymore (although it could be a file as well, but in Scala we don't currently throw errors on paths that are both files and directories, so we just choose the first we see). If we see a blob that matches the path exactly, then we know it's a file and stop iterating. The only reason we need to iterate through more than one blob is if there's blobs that are like '{path}zzzzz/foo or '{path}szzzzz. We need to ignore these as they don't provide any information on whether {path} is a file or directory.

Usability,"> I still generally find nginx and rules about trailing slashes confusing, but as far as I can tell this seems fine. What do you find confusing?. edit:; Not sure if this helps (if not, let me know, I should be able to clearly answer any questions you have):. Normal location blocks (meaning `location /path/to` with no modifiers or regex) match on prefix, which means that Nginx checks whether the specified `/path/to` exists entirely as a word in the longer url, starting from the beginning of that url (after the domain). A `location = /path/to` (with `=` modifier), is similar in that it is checked against the beginning of the url, with the change that the matched prefix must match exactly (there cannot be anything after `/path/to`). The proxy_pass rule with regard to slashes: Say I have `location /path/to/foo { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1; }`. Upon matching, Nginx will redirect the request to `127.0.0.1/path/to/foo`, because in the absence of a trailing slash, the entire url (after the domain) is appended. If the proxy_pass directive has a trailing slash, the entire matched prefix is dropped, and only the uri after the prefix is appended. Ex: if the url was `http://domain.com/path/to/foo`, the redirect would be `http://127.0.0.1/`. If the url was `http://domain.com/path/to/foo/bar` the redirect would be to `http://127.0.0.1/bar`. In this PR, when no trailing slash is provided to `https://internal.hail.is/monitoring/service`, the exact location block matches, since the inexact match block has a trailing slash, and therefore doesn't match the slash-less url (moot point anyway: if we made both the inexact and exact location blocks have no slashes, the exact one would take precedence).

Usability,"> I think pretty strongly that if nPreservedFields==0, you've done something very wrong. I don't disagree, but if you're concerned about this, I think an assert here is both in the wrong place and the wrong solution. I think for the design the IR, we should focus on (1) simple operations (this is already more complicated than I'd like), (2) that are composable, and (3) minimize special cases. By composability, I mean each IR should have a (local) contract, and each program composed from that local contract should be valid. Breaking this introduces a lot of potential bugs that can't be reasoned about locally, which is not good. The IR nodes do what they do. If you don't like what they do, we should probably find different ones. > so how could you possibly join this with another table? You'd have to create a single partition, and we'd never want to do that. Yeah, create a single partition. Or reshuffle if the partitioner has too little information. How much is too little? What if nPreservedFields==1 and we're down to 1 partition? Should that be an error? 2 partitions? How many partitions is too few? Any time nPreservedFields is less than the requested keys, you could get down to 1 partition. This is a continuous issue and rejecting the extreme case doesn't actually solve the problem. I guess isSorted isn't user exposed, but this seems dangerously close to reporting a user error with an assertion. When the service comes up, hopefully not too long, we're going to want to document the IR and make it public. So if we want to reject this case, we should do it early on: when the IR is parsed and/or constructed.

A 2nd question: how would a contributor submit write hybrid hail query/batch code that called batch from within a hail query script? So hail transforms data, say generates pc's, writes table, and then issues some batch commands that use a pre-built image, as opposed to requiring them to containerise their hail cod3. This will be useful: containerisation is the stated biggest pain point of batch, from my interviews. And one of the biggest hail issues is shuttling data between hail and other processes, which has led people to ask for tighter integration, or more statistical tools (so that they don't need to go out to those other tools, like plink). Showing Batch working from within hail-query scripts would be useful because it will show a much easier integration, and those examples or contributed modules should live somewhere (and that seems not to be hailtop, because this requires batch to be called from code that is calling hail directly, rather than through an image).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9194#issuecomment-671459432:18,clear,clear,18,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9194#issuecomment-671459432,1,['clear'],['clear']

That doesn't seem right. So I see two options:. I intended to always take the min (user's favor) for the end time and the start time should never change but if it does I take it to be earlier in our favor.

Usability,"> The thinking behind this is that there's a huge amount of re-use of code for an individual from one Hail analysis to the next. So I'm not sure I buy this. Hail is a exploratory data analysis platform, it isn't a SQL engine running nightly billing reports. In particular, as we do whole stage optimization and code generation. It isn't clear to me how you do code-reuse when we're specializing each operation into the global context (happy to hear the plan). For example, tables that have many fields, you will need to load different ones for different queries and in general it is infeasible (exponential) to generate them all. Also, to get sharing you need to break the code up and now you're running the compiler multiple times which also seems bad. Given our focus on large-scale analysis, introducing optimization boundaries for code reuse seems like a bad trade off to me. A significant amount of analysis happens in the cloud where $HOME is ephemeral so you won't get savings between sessions. Finally, there are pipelines that are more standardized but it is my impression they are run on extremely large datasets (hours, overnight) in which case compilation speed isn't important. Finally, there's the complexity around locking that isn't easy and have real technical risk. A compiler cache potentially becomes more appealing in the context of an always-on service. There's no locking issue, and you can start to do things like speculative compilation (e.g. immediately start compiling the decoder (the full decoder? Hmm.) when a user opens the dataset.). I would say getting in a 3x decoder improvement is way more important than this. I would have punted it down the road and instrumented to estimate cache hit rates before building this out.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-410358596:337,clear,clear,337,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-410358596,1,['clear'],['clear']

Usability,"> This looks like it would work. Do you think think that after the region value transition, the Variant, AltAllele, etc., classes will be replaced with their associated views?.

Make the AltAllele, Variant, etc. classes abstract, and have a concrete implementation (in terms of Scala types) and another mutable one in terms of a RegionValue. See my altAllele comment above. I'm not completely happy with the existing type hierarchy. In particular, the way things are stored now, the contig and start are duplicated in the row (pk vs k) and the ref is duplicated per allele. We did this so AltAllele was a sensible object, but I think this can be rethought and simplified, esp. as we move stuff into the expr language. I still think `Locus` is good (but it should be a `Long`, the global genomic position on the reference) and Variant should be split apart where the alleles are just an `Array[String]` which contains all the alleles including ref. Then the row type for a variant indexed data set should look like:. ```; Struct {; locus: Locus [= Long],; alleles: Array[String],; va: ...; gs: Array[...]; }; ```. Then the question becomes, how do we formulate things like `isSNP`? Does it become `isSNP(alleles, i)`? Is it enough to hang the genome reference off the Locus type and the alleles?

Usability,"> Why is writing the hail table first more efficient than just directly exporting from the grouped matrixtable?. We take special care to ensure our system is as efficient as possible when reading or writing to this native format. So, it's partly a sociological thing. On the practical end of things, Hail's native formats (for Tables and Matrix Tables) are a partitioned binary format. The partitioned part means Hail can use many cores in parallel to process and write the dataset. The binary part means that Hail need not use unnecessarily large (in terms of bytes) representations of values. These three things together make writing the native formats use less time, use less memory, and be more reliable. ---. > One thing I noticed is the mt_hwe_vals variable in my code below is a MatrixTable and not a GroupedMatrixTable. Is this correct?. Yes, after you aggregate you get back an MT with a different column key. ---. The `entries` method converts your matrix table from a compact and efficient matrix into a ""long"" and inefficient table. I generally recommend avoiding it if you can. However, if you only have a handful of ancestries, I wouldn't expect this to be *that* bad. You can just write the MT itself:. ```python3; ancestry_table = hl.Table.from_pandas(ancestry.astype({""person_id"":str}), key='person_id'); mt = mt.annotate_cols(ancestry = ancestry_table[mt.s].ancestry); mt_hwe_vals = mt.group_cols_by(mt.ancestry).aggregate(hwe = hl.agg.hardy_weinberg_test(mt.GT)); mt_hwe_vals = mt_hwe_vals.select_rows().select_cols() # drop irrelevant row and column fields; mt_hwe_vals.write(bucket + '/hwe.ht'); ```. ---. > I tried modifying the code to what is shown below but I'm still having the same issue. Just to be clear it's the exact same error ""Container exited with a non-zero exit code 137. ""?

Usability,"> all options that are also gcloud options (such as --project)? [That] could be difficult. Yes, this is what I was thinking. `hailctl` could parse (as much as is needed) the `gcloud` options to find options (like `--project`) and modify others (like `--initialization-actions`). The latter is somewhat surprising since one expects everything after the `--` to pass through unchanged. OK, summarizing our options so far:. - hailctl has no options that are also gcloud options. gcloud options go after the `--`, and get modified as needed by hailctl (with a message).; - hailctl has no gcloud options that are simply pass through. gcloud options that are needed by hailctl commands are hailctl options (like `--project`). When a gcloud option is needed by some hailctl command, all hailctl commands take that option (when it makes sense), even if in some cases that makes them simply pass through. This fixes the inconsistency issues, but the user still needs to keep track of which gcloud options needs to be passed to hailctl and which are passed to gcloud directly. If you specify an option twice, once to hailctl and once to gcloud, we invoke gcloud with the option duplicated. Pros and cons:; - The first option has the most consistent interface.; - The first option modifies options after the --, which is surprising.; - The first option involves replication (some of) the gcloud option parsing semantics, which is annoying.; - The second option requires the user to know which gcloud options need to be passed to hailctl instead (but globally, not per-command).; - With the second option, if we want to warn (or error) on duplicate options, we're back to duplicating the gcloud option parsing logic. I think I'm coming around to the second option. > so that hailctl dataproc submit cluster -- --script-options would work.

Usability,"> validation. Checking the arguments to the `Variant` constructor and generating nice error messages. For CNV work, you want to parallelize over files and not lines within files? You need to process the each file serially?. I'm not against having an additional interface like ParseContext that you can use both for the RDD interface and for the CNV stuff. Another option might be to make `TableReader[C[_]](...): (TStruct, C[Annotation])` but you'll have to do some work to define a `C` that knows how to load itself from a file, for example. It would be useful to be able to write code that can be used with either RDDs or local collections. > For the 'annotation line' are you suggesting a general error-catching wrapper?. Yep! I'll look over your proposed interface. Letting my mind wander a little here. One of the challenges with Spark error handling is propagating errors from the workers back to the master. RDDs are naturally used functionally, so functional error handling might be a better approach. The `Try` monad is the normal way to do functional error handling in Scala. Since we have concurrency, we have multiple errors and we want to preserve them all. In addition, it would be nice if the new generalized `Try` monad tracked warnings (like VCFReport).

Usability,"@cseed As I briefly mentioned in an email on Saturday, I moved notebook loading to a prefetched model. Data and page loading are decoupled: When one clicks on the Notebook link, routing to the page happens without waiting for data to come in from notebook-api.hail.is. If data is available, it is shown, else a loading indicator. To avoid loading screens, I call notebook-api.hail.is asynchronously immediately after a user hits app.hail.is, whether they're on the Notebook page or not. Therefore, typically a user will never see a Notebook page loading indicator, when they click from one page to Notebook (say they land on the home page: by the time they click on Notebook, the data is fetched, so no loading screen). Furthermore, web sockets keep that Notebook data up to date, again regardless of whether a user is on the Notebook page. So in all instances except when a user lands on Notebook directly, the time it takes to reach the Notebook page is << 16ms (seemingly ~3ms). A similar approach is now used for scorecard, except Scorecard will render data in the SSR phase (because I consider scorecard less important, and because most users of the web app won't need it), and will not prefetch data when on another page. However, clicking on ""Scorecard"" from another page will not cause routing to block while waiting for the https://scorecard.hail.is/json response; instead a loading indicator will be shown. In practice I find this preferable, because the GUI feels more responsive, and users get more feedback. This demonstrates the core benefit of universal rendering approaches, and how they can improve page loading times over even the leanest server-side rendered application.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5162#issuecomment-462221996:1480,responsiv,responsive,1480,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5162#issuecomment-462221996,2,"['feedback', 'responsiv']","['feedback', 'responsive']"

Usability,"@cseed, details below, exec summary: a series of confusions and confusing interfaces lead to cloud tools deployment issues. The resolution is to fix the deploy script to always deploy `cloudtools` for python 2 and 3 (because *it* works with both). Users will need `python2` somewhere on their PATH, but `gsutil` will guide them through that, i.e. not our problem. There is no problem except that I cannot approve my own PR. I noticed @catoverdrive wasn't actually assigned, so it wasn't in her scorecard queue. ---. There was a bit of confusion around this recently that @catoverdrive figured out. So, `gsutil` only supports `python2`, but it's happy to search through your path for a variety of binaries with suggestive names until it finds a valid python 2.x binary. `cloudtools` itself works with any version of python (there was a recent breaking change in the release of python 3.7, which broke cloud tools [but that's been resolved in an open PR](https://github.com/Nealelab/cloudtools/pull/91/files#diff-7decff7c08c5270a32982ea34483b8cbR11)). Now, wrt PYPI, @catoverdrive discovered that the version of python you use to run `setup.py bdist_wheel` determines which version of python is deployed. This is rather confusing and, since none (or many?) of us did not know this, we accidentally uploaded a variety of [cloud tools versions on pypi, as you've noted](https://pypi.org/simple/cloudtools/). There was some earlier confusion wherein I thought we should only support `python2`, but that was a mistake on my end. We should support both versions, and when the user tries to start a cluster, `gsutil` will provide an error message guiding them to install `python2`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4240#issuecomment-419912588:317,guid,guide,317,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4240#issuecomment-419912588,3,"['guid', 'simpl']","['guide', 'guiding', 'simple']"

Usability,"@danking I've made all of the changes except the one about the interface for `af_dist`. (I agree with the point you're making about it being confusing that both functions are seeded separately and need to be kept the same for the same dataset to be produced, but making it take a function might just add a lot of visual noise. Honestly, I'm really tempted to take all of the `seed` stuff out of `balding_nichols_model` and put a note in to the effect of ""for reproducible results, use `hl.set_global_seed()` just before creating a dataset."" How would you feel about that?). re: how seeding functions happens more generally---I don't think anything I've said in the docs is actually incorrect (I would consider array transformations a context, kind of like the axes of a table or matrix table, so the table should end up with `x = y = z` but different values for the elements in the array, and different values between rows), but I'll work on making the language clearer so that they actually say what I mean. w.r.t. `[z, z]` being two draws---I have sometimes waffled on this but in general I think I tend to disagree, in part because I have struggled to come up with a consistent definition of what that would mean.

We ran eigenstrat with the 5000 samples + 2500 1000 genomes samples and those PCs look good. . So I am not sure it is the replicates that are the underlying cause. It may simply be the lack of the 1000 Genomes samples in the dataset for the PCs. I am will try adding the 1000 genomes samples to see if that fixes things.

Usability,"@jjfarrell Thanks for sharing that! This is really interesting information. I'm quite surprised, but the evidence is pointing to there being a PC that largely separates those 8 replicates from the entire remaining dataset (!!!). I'm personally quite surprised that 8 samples out of thousands could pull this off, but that definitely seems to be the issue, given that the PCs from PC-AiR avoid the issue. Thank you so much for hunting this down! It's very valuable information for us. ### Next Steps . So, clearly we need a solution for users that have substantial numbers of related individuals in their source dataset (especially if the pedigrees are unknown). For your _particular_ use case, I can add a blurb to the docs that recommends removing known replicates _before_ PCA and then projecting them using the loadings from PCA. A longer term solution is to simply implement PC-AiR in hail. I skimmed the implementation section of the paper earlier this week and it looks very straightforward. It seems to boil down to using the KING estimator to estimate relatedness, compute PCA on unrelated individuals, project related individuals into unrelated PC space. Finally, we can use pc_relate to improve on our original estimates of relatedness from KING. The timeline for the latter thing is kind of unclear and a bit further out given some other work I need to finish. I'll get the documentation improvement in this week.

Usability,"@jjfarrell Thanks for the information! This will be very helpful as I try to tease out what the issue is here. Also, I'm sorry my initial response was curt! I was a bit tired at the time and probably shouldn't have been responding to GitHub issues ðŸ˜…. Hail's version of pc-relate does not identify an initial set of related and unrelated individuals. The R `pcrelate` implementation (the official / reference implementation by the authors of the paper) does this to identify a set of individuals on which to run the principal components analysis. It is not entirely clear to me why this is necessary, and we don't currently have a mechanism for doing so (since pc_relate _is_ our mechanism for determining related and unrelated individuals when there is population structure in the data set). If you have prior knowledge about related samples, you might try filtering to an known unrelated set and computing the scores from that set. I'm curious if that makes any difference in the results. Your invocations look very reasonable. I'll get in touch with the gnomAD team here at the broad to learn more about their experiences with pc_relate and see if I can better understand what's happening with the replicate samples.

Usability,"After some reading, I am still not sure what exactly the difference is between dummy coding and one-hot encoding. Suppose there is a categorical variable with $n$ categories. The [referenced Stack Exchange question](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/224051/one-hot-vs-dummy-encoding-in-scikit-learn) suggests that a one-hot encoding converts the categorical variable to $n$ indicator variables (one for each category) and that a dummy coding converts the categorical variable to $n-1$ indicator variables. With these definitions, the dummy coding is the one-hot encoding without one of the indicator variables. However, from the prototype implementation in this issue, the [scikit-learn one-hot encoder documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html), and the [dummy variable Wikipedia article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics)), I get the impression that dummy coding and one-hot encoding are synonyms and that there is no real distinction. Anyway, I would like to work on this issue. I will base my implementation on the prototype, and perhaps we can add a parameter to drop one of the indicator variables similar to what the [scikit-learn one-hot encoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) has.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13601#issuecomment-1932779413:301,learn,learn,301,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13601#issuecomment-1932779413,5,['learn'],['learn']

Then to create a new iterator `FlipbookIterator(new BgenRecordStateMachine(...))`.

Actually, awesome if it doesn't poll but uses, say, websockets, and the server watches the pod for a notification for k8s (or does this and also polls, which seems to be our standard pattern).

Usability,"As I mentioned, I think this, plus KinshipMatrix and LDMatrix are getting lost in the domain-specific details. I suggest the following structure:; - an abstract Python `Matrix` class for numeric matrices. This should have (at least) three implementations: local, indexed-row and block. It should have read/write methods. It should support at least basic operations: *, +, -. They might not all be supported on all combination of implementations. There should be operations for converting between them. @danking is working on freeing us from Spark matrices and building on Breeze. You might coordinate here.; - a `Vector` class; - a `KeyedMatrix` which has row and column keys with schemas, or possibly a SymmetricKeyedMatrix to start if that is all we need (e.g. for Kinship and LD). This should again have read/write.; - then Eigen is just a KeyedMatrix with a Vector; - I'd nuke Kinship and LD, or if it is necessary to keep n{Samples, Variants}Used, it should be a simple wrapper class with the integer value and the underlying keyed matrix.

Usability,"At some point, we should think about how to improve the discoverability and machine-verifiability of our APIs. Currently the tightest type of job log is rather complex. If the performance is OK, I think we should move towards classes that define the request and response types of each call. ---. The main difference is `hail-pip-install` having `retry`. If pip exits with a non-zero exit code, we'll just rerun the command exactly, at most four more times. This mitigates missing retry logic in `pip` itself. For example, [this job](https://ci.hail.is/batches/167314/jobs/27) failed because pip encountered a connection reset while downloading a file. Ideally, pip would simply retry the download. Since we don't control the pip source code, I use a retry that treats all of pip as a black box. There's definitely a failure mode: if you specify a package that doesn't exist, pip will error five times in a row and take ~30 seconds before the retry logic gives up.

Usability,"Because that won't work at all, because the input file name expected by `gatk IndexFeatureFile` won't exist. But perhaps you meant to connect the unrelated filenames via something like. ```; â€¦; bgzip -c {j.tsv_counts} > {j.counts['tsv.gz']}; â€¦; ```. Reasons for not doing that would include:. 1. Filename extensions are significant to GATK, so I would not trust `SubCommand` to write the output file in the right format if the filename did not have the expected extension. (This could be ameliorated via `j.tsv_counts.set_extension`.). 2. Using bgzip with `-c â€¦ >` is not its natural mode of operation, so is more likely to encounter bugs than the more typical `bgzip filename` invocation. (For example, plain gzip burns the input filename into the compressed file's header, so the redirection version produces different results from the typical invocation for gzip; bgzip does not embed the filename but the change may have other effects. For example, bgzip's error checking (e.g. in disk full situations) may well be more complete in the typical invocation than when writing to standard output.). It is also less clear than the straightforward invocation, so using this would be a hack. 4. The resulting code is IMHO overall less clear than the original version in which the resource group models the relationship between all three filenames.

Usability,"Conceptually, if we're not just interested in missingness, then unboxedGT is useful only in route to nNonRefAlleles (and equal to it if we've split). E.g., the simplest way to extend regression to multi-allelic is to use nNonRefAlleles...though thinking about this further, it's upsettingly asymmetric in the case where the ref allele is the minor allele, so perhaps we should just force deliberate choice of splitting, esp if we're moving toward implementing that less painfully under the hood. Or do regression per alternate allele while maintaining multi-allelic form. (edited). We currently compute nNonRefAlleles from unboxedGT through GTPair, which allocates per genotype. For example, PCA currently requires splitting, but uses nNonRefAlleles. And IBD currently requires splitting but allocates per genotype via:; ```; def countRefs(gtIdx: Int): Int = {; val gt = Genotype.gtPair(gtIdx); indicator(gt.j == 0) + indicator(gt.k == 0); ```.

Usability,"Currently pruning dependencies, forking NextJS to remove poly fills for older browsers, and focusing on bundle size. Investigated using Inferno.js as a lighter alternative to React. Saves ~20-30KB bundle size, and is somewhat faster. However, main Inferno dev moved to React core team, and React is focusing on the optimizations present in Inferno for 2019 (DOM: move to native events where possible), as well as introducing optimizations not found in Inferno (compile time targets: initially inlining, future maybe web assembly binaries; move rendering work to separate thread / concurrent rendering). Furthermore, React ecosystem is orders of magnitude larger, so we can save a huge amount of dev time by avoiding Inferno (N modules * time to develop bespoke module avg), and have greater likelihood of LTS. Notably, I realized that most of my bundle size was coming from inefficient bundling of Material UI and due to Apollo's insanely large graphQL bundle. Removing these now. Lastly, React is actually very efficient. jQuery is ~31.1KB minified. React is 3KB, while React DOM is 33.8KB. In 2019 React DOM will shrink. In any case, given that React is both faster than jQuery, dramatically simplifies development, and introduces development structure, 4KB cost is imo worth it.

Usability,"For your considerationâ€¦ We often have a `pathlib.Path` or `cloudpathlib.CloudPath` that we've built up by parts, which is then the path to be used as an input resource:. ```python; res = mybatch.read_input(str(mycloudpath)); ```. Periodically we accidentally omit the `str(â€¦)`, which leads to a semi-obscure error message and an extra editing round-trip. There is a point of view that `read_input()` and `read_input_group()` could also accept `os.PathLike` objects directly, and have Hail convert them to `str` itself, e.g. in `_new_input_resource_file()` which underlies both methods, as per this PR. The difficulty is how to do that conversion: `str(â€¦)` does the trick for [`pathlib.Path`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/pathlib.html#operators) and [`cloudpathlib.CloudPath`](https://cloudpathlib.drivendata.org/stable/api-reference/cloudpath/), returning the path and URL, respectively, as a string. But it looks like in theory there might be [`os.PathLike`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.PathLike) subclasses that don't define `__str__()` to produce a usable path/URL. The official conversion method appears to be [`os.fspath()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fspath), but that does not do the right thing for `cloudpath.CloudPath` â€” there it downloads the remote file and returns a local path â€” which is not at all what Hail needs.

Usability,"Further pruned. Removed all GraphQL libraries, besides graphql-tag, which I like, because 1) simple hash-based cache: no need to walk complex graph to normalize cache, because in most cases I'm perfectly fine with not re-using cache across different queries (that may have some shared fields). Apollo does something ""smarter"", but much slower: walks a query, checks that the requested fields for a node are the same, and that the node's id is the same, as some other query. 2) no runtime validation of query shape via graphql-tag...uses simple template strings, which are free. We don't care about schema validation in the client...because the server will error when schema is invalid. This should be compile time validated instead, in this case via integration tests. Also removed react-icons... I was going to use this in place of material-design-icons, because I thought loading the full font, when I needed only a few icons, would be unnecessarily expensive. It turns out that I cannot find a library where a single icon import (react-icons or MaterialUI) is smaller than Google's entire material design font: a single font (there are several needed to cover all icons) is ~500B. A single react-icons icon is ~2KB on dev (production may be smaller due to tree shaking). Also, am opposed to CSS-in-JS: slower, worse tooling, larger. Benefits are dynamic selectors, which are really no advantage that I can see (without them can still dynamically apply classes, as in the yee ol days of pleb vanilla js).

Usability,"HDF5 ""files""Â are usually literally a single file. While fine for traditional file systems, this is not a good fit for object stores like GCS and S3. Object stores tend to scale horizontally providing high aggregate bandwidth across many individual objects. There appear to be some efforts to permit HDF5 to read and write to object stores in an object-store-friendly manner. In particular, there is a [GCS connector](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/cloud-amazon-s3-storage-hdf5-connector/). It's not an object store, but there's also support for [Hadoop HDFS](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hadoop-hdfs-hdf5-connector/). There's also [the Virtual Object Layer](https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/develop/_h5_v_l__u_g.html) which appears to be a file system abstraction that would permit storing HDF5 ""files"" in multiple objects which plays well with cloud object store scaling. We should prioritize an importer because no one has asked for HDF5 export nor is it clear that the HDF5 client libraries make it easy to write a single HDF5 ""file"" from a cluster of cores separated by a network. An importer would look something like `MatrixVCFReader`. It will need to use an HDF5 Java client library. An HDF5 client API is described [here](https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/develop/_h_d_f5_l_i_b.html) but they don't link to any JARs or maven repositories. This [support thread from 2022](https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/how-to-get-started-wih-hdf5-java/10346/14) appears to ultimately conclude that [netcdf-java](https://forum.hdfgroup.org/t/how-to-get-started-wih-hdf5-java/10346/24) supports reading HDF5 files. Including netcdf-java in a gradle or maven project is described [here](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-java/current/userguide/using_netcdf_java_artifacts.html). It is not entirely clear how to use netcdf-java to access objects in Google Cloud Storage or Azure Blob Storage.

Usability,"Here are some slightly scattered thoughts:. You're pointing out that sometimes, it is better to unroll a stream, meaning the consumer code is repeated once per stream element. There is a more general version of this, where you want to concatenate several streams, and you might want to repeat the consumer code once per source stream. My instinct in cases like that is that both options (unroll the stream or not) should be explicitly representable in the IR, and the choice should be made before code generation. I think the fundamental issue you're pointing out is that MakeStream is most naturally a push stream (it wants to be the one driving the outer loop), and that because we don't support push streams we're forced to generate suboptimal code. But zip doesn't work for push streams. I think the only general solution is to support both push streams and pull streams explicitly, but that would add a significant amount of complexity.

Same needs to be done for VDS, this isn't too hard); - Add the non-core methods to `hail.methods` / `hail.genetics.methods`; - some stuff here is much harder than the rest, like `filter_alleles`; - This is mostly just labor, but some require more thought than others, like moving TDT to use hail2 expr; - Support intervals in the `index_*` methods. It's possible now to join by locus, but not using the `annotateLociTable` fast path.; - Move to Python 3 so argument order is preserved; - Test the hail2 api much more rigorously than we do now (at the very least, call each parameter branch for each method!; - Typecheck the expression language. This isn't super trivial, and making a nice system to integrate our `typecheck` module and expressions will require some thoughtful design work.; - Some more organization around the package: monkey patching with `import hail.genetics` is an idea I like, but want to think about the edge cases first. ## Documentation; - Document the `index_*` methods / joins; - Translate the _Hail Overview_ tutorial; - Make new tutorials to replace the 2 expr ones we have; - Fill in docs on api2 methods (they're not all there yet); - Fill in docs on expression language (things like __mul__ on NumericExpression haven't been documented); - Write ""integrative docs"" that provide how-tos for common types of workflows. Show the power of annotate / select / group_by/aggregate, etc. ## Longer term QoL:; - Move over tests to Python as much as possible.

Usability,"Hey @natestockham,. I'm glad you resolved the breeze issue. I imagine you were encountering a situation where the native libraries were not extant / not where expected / not the correct architecture. Three of the newly failing tests are related to plink. The output included in `tests.zip` indicates that you're using a fairly old version of plink,; ```; PLINK v1.90b1b 64-bit (20 May 2014); ```; Our testing server uses versions of plink from 2016. It's possible these tests are over constrained and need to be relaxed. I will investigate the precision required to pass the two tests in `IBDSuite`. However, part of one failure in the `IBDSuite` and the failure in the `ImputeSexSuite` are both caused by plink failing to produce output on certain input files. I strongly suspect these are bugs in plink version `1.90b1b` because plink `1.90b3.38` (from 2016, the version used on our test server) does not err on such files. This leaves one final test: `LinearMixedRegressionSuite.genAndFitLMM`.

Usability,"Hi @danking, thanks for this. On the topic of asserts, there are really two interacting issues:. 1. Asserts are intended to ensure invariants, i.e. conditions that should always be true. In correct code, assertions should never raise so disabling them should have no consequences at runtime. In practice, however, they are often casually used to catch value errors, which can be expected to occur if a user-facing method receives bad/nonsensical inputs (e.g. here: https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/1940547d35ddddb084ad52684e36153c1e03a331/hail/python/hailtop/hailctl/dataproc/diagnose.py#L62); 2. Python's language design allows anyone calling your code to disable asserts for optimization purposes, because disabling asserts should never change the semantics of the program. Putting these two features together, you can arrive at a situation where a user thinks they're turning off asserts (which should never raise anyway) and instead stops catching value errors (whose absence can never be guaranteed). All that said, if the final answer is: ""if you invoke `-O` you deserve what's coming"", I'm happy to drop it :). Thanks for taking a look at the example. If I understand you correctly, it sounds like I passed the wrong inputs to the function, in which case it might be clearer to raise a ValueError instead of an AssertionError in the end. On a closer look, it seems like most of the instances of `assert(x, y)` are actually in scala code-- my mistake.

Usability,"Hi,. I'm just curious if you tried black on a code that uses Hail query.

On the other hand, query can be seen as a DSL on top of Python, so the same guidelines probably don't need to be applied to it. Wondering if you had thoughts about lining the query code? We will be writing a lot of that in the nearest future in the Centre for Population Genomics, and would love to set up some style checks, or even automate that with a tool like black.

Usability,"I figured, noticed the double post :). ```; The exception in your above message is coming from the Apply node being inferred as a PVoid by your case _ => PVoid code. Writing the rule for the apply node should fix that.; ```. Right. It's just that I tried to write the rule, and quickly ran across the fact that Seq[IR] would be inferred such that the first IR had a different type from the 2nd or Nth. This is what I had written:. ```scala; case ApplySpecial(name, irs) => {; val it = irs.iterator; val head = it.next(); head.inferSetPType(env). while(it.hasNext) {; val value = it.next(). value.inferSetPType(env); assert(value.pType2 == head.pType2); }. head.pType2; }; ```. With the result in one case that `head.pType2` was bool, `value.pType2` was something else. Without a type union, it wasn't clear to me what to return. One possibility was that I shouldn't handle this node, so I started with that possibility, which I know understand isn't right. The other was that the implementation was wrong, and my first guess there is that one of the IRs dictates the type (say the first), the 2nd is that there is a simple precedence rule, the 3rd is that the type inference procedure has some branching logic over the collection.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6594#issuecomment-513007861:801,clear,clear,801,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6594#issuecomment-513007861,2,"['clear', 'simpl']","['clear', 'simple']"

Usability,"I guess in simple terms I'm more of a member of the ""getting things done"" community than the; ""modern C++"" community. I have seen std::unique_ptr used in practice, and it was a bad experience.; And I stand by my contention that it doesn't solve any of the hard problems (whereas shared_ptr; very much does). Now I realize that people writing books about C++ write a good deal about move semantics and; unique_ptr. My interpretation is that there's a lot of writing about it because it involves concepts; which simply don't occur in any other commonly-used languages, and as such it requires a; good deal of explanation and justification because it's peculiar and unfamiliar. I suggest that; other languages haven't invented this concept because it's a) confusing and b) not particularly; useful. There's one really good thing you get from move semantics: the ability to resize a std::vector<T>; or std::unordered_map<T> without constructing deep copies of each T object. In the cases; where that's useful, it's very useful for optimizing performance without totally bypassing all your; abstraction mechanisms. The other ways people attempt to exploit move semantics are IMO; just a bad idea: if you want to pass around a large expensive-to-create object, then do it the; Java way by putting it on the heap and passing around some kind of reference, and *everyone* can understand it, not just experts in modern C++. Another angle on this debate would be to look at some open-source C++ projects and see how; often they actually use unique_ptr and/or std::move. My guess is that it's much less common; in practice than you might think from reading books about C++, because the overlap between; ""object ownership is passed around"" and ""... but we always know precisely who has ownership""; is not a very big part of the design space - compared to a whole lot of ""always owned by the object which created it"" and ""used in several places at once and we don't know who will be the last to drop it"".

Usability,"I have a fairly bad case of PTSD around over-use of std::unique_ptr and std::move at; Oracle/Endeca. I think std::unique_ptr<T> is deeply confusing and evil because, in the; simplest terms, it doesn't have the normal semantics of a ""pointer"", i.e. two or more pointers; can refer to a single object. And that problem becomes massively aggravated in the; almost-universal situation of ""borrowing"" a pointer for the duration of a procedure call. Once you let std::unique_ptr<T> into your code, it can creep out into a whole lot of places; where it adds complexity and confusion without solving any real problem. In this particular case, the complexity of managing the memory chunks isn't that hard,; they all get cleaned up by the Region destructor, and adding another layer of software; with the Chunk class seems to obscure rather than clarify what is happening.

Usability,"I made some edits that I think helped to reduce the number of places that are aware of the notion of a default_region. It's really now just isolated to the `InstanceCollectionManager`, since that's the piece of code that's making the decision ""use the default region when the cluster is small"". I didn't quite like the pattern of retrieving a default from a `LocationMonitor` just to give it right back to the location monitor in the next line. I think this way the `LocationMonitor` API is much simpler, and we can actually remove its `default_location` method entirely as I believe it is no longer used. I can do that in a follow-up PR if you like this approach. One other thing is I wanted to articulate the distinction between the ""region CI needs its jobs in"" and the ""default region that batch will spin up workers in for small clusters"". While they are in practice the same, I found that treating them both as the ""default_region"" tied the logic around jobs for CI closely with internal Batch decisions and made it more confusing for me to reason about. I tried to separate out these two concepts so that in the future when jobs support region-specific scheduling it will be easier to excise the CI-specific code from the Batch scheduler. Another thing that I realized during this process is that Azure has regions and zones just like GCP, though they may differ slightly since we don't need to specify a zone for a VM and such. I am fine with using the term ""location"" to mean ""where we scheduled the VM, either zone or region depending on the cloud provider"", but I would also like to follow up with a sweep that makes this language more precise where possible. For example, the `possible_cloud_locations` function is really just `possible_cloud_regions`, and we could even go so far as mandating a `region` field in the global config instead of having `azure_location` and `gcp_region`, which are synonymous even though named differently.

The paper computes the principal components associated with the related samples with. $$ \frac{1}{p} Y W (\Sigma^2)^{-1}.$$. ### Simplifications. The first simplification that I noticed is that we can do away with the $\frac{1}{p}$ terms. Because $\Psi$ is scaled by $p^{-1}$, the inverse of the eigenvalues, $(\Sigma^2)^{-1}$ is scaled by $p$, which cancels out the $1/p$ term in the calculation of the principal components for the related individuals. From here on, let us redefine $\Sigma^2$ as the diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of $XX^T$ (not $\frac{1}{p} XX^T$). Next, by examining the relationship between singular value decomposition (SVD) and eigendecomposition ([Wikipedia link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition#Relation_to_eigenvalue_decomposition)), I realized that it is not necessary to compute $\Psi$. Instead, we can get $U$ and $\Sigma$ from the SVD of $X$:. $$X = U\Sigma V^T,$$. where $V$ is a $p \times p$ basis of the new PCA coordinate space. Then while investigating the meaning of $W$, I realized that $W = X^T U = V \Sigma^T U^T U = V \Sigma^T$.

Usability,"I think tying the reset to the iterator is a mistake. First, iterator is the wrong abstraction here. Whole-stage code generation should use the aggregator/array strategy we're using in Emit to generate nothing, conditionals and loops for map, filter and flatMap, respectively. Ideally read ... do stuff ... write will generate an RDD with no per-element iterators at all. I want to make sure this picture is clear. Second, we want to vectorize in the database sense: we want to process multiple rows together in batches. Then overall structure of a stage is a loop over the batches, and and a loop within batches. Thus, the common case should not be we reset after every element, so I think it's the wrong direction to bake it in. The place where we do this should be interface points with the Spark stack which should be looked at with scorn and derision and as the organizing model. Finally, this points to an ongoing difference in our views about the meaning of context. I see context as serving two purposes (neither of which involve reset):. - First, context is a set of resources needed to process a partition that should be released when the partition is complete. For example, I'm working on GenomicsDB which needs to localize a GenomicsDB shard to a local file that needs to be cleaned up when the partition is complete. - Second, it is a way to tell an iterator where to return its value. (This is the ""current"" region business.). I'd be happy to separate these, but I don't see clean way.

Usability,"I think we should find a time to discuss this in person if the following explanation doesn't make sense. . Right now, for small batches, we send one REST request to the server to both create the batch and create the jobs. However, if we want one REST request for an update (ideal for the query service and low latency jobs?), we have to use relative job ids because (1) we don't know the absolute start index of the jobs until we've gotten the start id of the update back from the server and (2) the job dependencies can be a mix of known job ids that have already been previously submitted in a previous creation/update. The negative job IDs are a way to deal with a mix of relative ids within an update and known, submitted job ids. We can simplify things if we require all updates make two requests to the server to (1) get the start id and establish the update and then (2) submit new jobs with all absolute job IDs. I'd have to make sure this will actually simplify things because I also ran into a bifurcation in how the job IDs are handled in `BatchBuilder.create_job()`. We currently populate the spec with a job id before we've made any requests to the server. We need to know how many total jobs there are before we can figure out the job ids because the API for creating a new update requires reserving a block of job IDs which then returns the start id.

Alternatively, I could also expect that globals now contains a reference to a new table, that contains only the column index, and value (phenotype), which seems fine. Neither of these options happens. Instead, I need to realize the array in memory on my master, which seems like a potentially bad idea.

Writing interfaces that take advantage of move semantics requires understanding rvalue-references in more detail, but for users of those move-enabled interfaces I think the guidelines are easy to teach: a variable will only be modified by moving if it is explicitly tagged with a `std::move`, so all you have to remember is ""after a `std::move(foo)`, the variable `foo` may only be assigned to or deleted."". > And then you get into a whole host of associated design decisions (I'm holding this as a unique_ptr,; but I want to pass it to a function - should I pass it as a raw pointer ? a raw reference ? a reference; to the unique_ptr ?).

Usability,"I'm fairly certain I know understand this and the AoU VDS creation issue. In Dataproc versions 1.5.74, 2.0.48, and 2.1.0, Dataproc introduced ""memory protection"" which is a euphemism for a newly aggressive OOMKiller. When the OOMKiller kills the JVM driver process, there is no hs_err_pid...log file, no exceptional log statements, and no clean shutdown of any sockets. The process is simply SIGTERM'ed and then SIGKILL'ed. From Hail 0.2.83 through Hail 0.2.109 (released February 2023), Hail was pinned to Dataproc 2.0.44. From Hail 0.2.15 onwards, `hailctl dataproc`, by default, reserves 80% of the advertised memory of the driver node for the use of the Hail Query Driver JVM process. For example, Google advertises that an n1-highmem-8 has 52 GiB of RAM, so Hail sets the `spark:spark.driver.memory` property to `41g` (we always round down). Before aggressive memory protection, this setting was sufficient to protect the driver from starving itself of memory. Unfortunately, Hail 0.2.110 upgraded to Dataproc 2.1.2 which enabled ""memory protection"". Moreover, in the years since Hail 0.2.15, the memory in use by system processes on Dataproc driver nodes appears to have increased. Due to these two circumstances, the driver VM's memory usage can grow high enough to trigger the OOMKiller before the JVM triggers a GC. Consider, for example, these slices of the syslog of the n1-highmem-8 driver VM of a Dataproc cluster:. ```; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: earlyoom v1.6.2; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: mem total: 52223 MiB, swap total: 0 MiB; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: sending SIGTERM when mem <= 0.12% and swap <= 1.00%,; Nov 22 14:26:51 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m earlyoom[4115]: SIGKILL when mem <= 0.06% and swap <= 0.50%; ...; Nov 22 14:30:05 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m post-hdfs-startup-script[7747]: + echo 'All done'; Nov 22 14:30:05 vds-cluster-91f3f4c1-b737-m post-hdfs-startup-script[7",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1836844790:385,simpl,simply,385,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1836844790,1,['simpl'],['simply']

Usability,"OK, I've made most of the changes and I'd appreciate some feedback before I finalize the PR. Notable changes:; - The `hailctl dataproc` subcommand now has `--beta`, `--configuration=`, `--dry-run`, `--project=` and `--zone=`. These apply to all commands. There is a `GcloudRunner` object that takes these options, is set to the click context user `obj` field, and is used by all hailctl dataproc commands to invoke gcloud. Note, not all dataproc subcommands invoke gcloud, but the current design doesn't differentiate. Note, with `click`, the subcommand options must go on the subcommand, so `hailctl dataproc stop --dry-run` is an error.; - hailctl no longer takes `--region` (for gcloud dataproc commands). I compute region in `GcloudRunner` by checking dataproc/region or falling back to determining the region from the zone. I error if the region and zone are incompatible (gcloud would also do this).; - I stripped all gcloud pass through args from `hailctl dataproc modify`. There aren't any left. Invoking `modify` now looks like:. ```; hailctl dataproc modify my-cluster \; --extra-glcoud-update-args='---num-workers=2 --num-secondary-workers=100'; ```. The `extra` in the option name sounds a little weird since they are the only options (and the command isn't run if they aren't specified), but I'm leaving it for consistency for now. I moved the help text from the removed options into the help for the modify command itself. The output of `modify --help` is included below.; - I plan to leave the `--async` option to stop, although it is pass through.; - Then there is `--files` for submit. This is passed through, but `--py-files` is needed (it is not passed through, but modified). Do I leave `--files`? I'm currently inclined to.; - Finally, I need to strip out the pass through arguments for start like I did with update. ```; $ hailctl dataproc modify --help; Usage: hailctl dataproc modify [OPTIONS] CLUSTER_NAME.

Usability,"OK, here's my understanding of prometheus and our use of it after chatting with @daniel-goldstein :; 1. The Python client treats Summary as just a pair of a Gauge and Counter. It's only useful if you need to track the number of times you set/increments/decrement a value and the value itself. For example, the total number of visits to a web page. Some clients for other languages treat Summaries as histogram-like things, but the Python client does not.; 2. A Histogram, with a domain-relevant array of buckets, is the right tool for visualizing a distribution of values. In this PR, we treat percent-of-cores-in-use-on-instance as a Histogram. This should let us see the distribution of instances according to what percent of the cores are revenue-generating versus not.; 3. A Gauge is the right tool for visualizing any other value. In this PR, we use a gauge to measure the total jobs, the used cores, the total free cores, the total cores, the total cost per hour (ignoring disk), and the total revenue per hour (ignoring disk). ; 4. It is important to use `remove` for metrics whose label set changes over time. For example, if all the jobs owned by a particular user finish, then the metrics labelled with that user ought to become `0`. The database query will elide such records; therefore, it is important to `remove` such labels from the `USER_CORES` and `USER_JOBS`. We prefer `remove` to `clear` so as to avoid the case where prometheus collects metrics in between a call to `clear` and a call to `set` which restores the value for a still valid label.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12253#issuecomment-1273927865:1401,clear,clear,1401,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12253#issuecomment-1273927865,2,['clear'],['clear']

Usability,"One obvious point of optimization that Dan already identified is the way we were keying our data is causing full shuffles, as we were keying the data by a string variant ID in the form `1-32683987-ACTCTT-A` instead of locus-allele. Changing back to keying on locus-allele fixes this issue for our more straightforward searches, but we have a search that looks for pairs of possible compound heterozygous variants in the same gene, and that still is resulting in 2 full shuffles. I'm a little at a loss for how to fix this, because we are grouping by an unsorted field so I'm not sure how to prevent us from working with an unsorted dataset.

Usability,"Oof, good catch! The thing we're trying to avoid is `e^x` overflowing for large positive `x`. In double precision, the smallest `x` that overflows is 710. So to test that we handle overflow correctly, you can check `sigmoid(710) == 1.0` and `sigmoid(-710) == 0.0` (using approximate equality). Actually, after playing with this, if you just use the simple definition `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))`, then `sigmoid(-710)` does overflow, but it returns the right answer since `np.exp(710)` returns `inf`, and `1 / inf == 0.0`. But `math.exp(710)` throws an exception. `hl.exp` seems to have the numpy behavior, so I think the simple version actually works. But we should add the above test. I think wrapping this in an exposed function is a good idea. I agree it should be called `expit`, both for consistency with scipy, and because as you say, `sigmoid` really just means an S shaped function.

I think LogisticRegressionNullFit should be a separate class, as it plays a conceptually and practically different role. I don't want to attach vectors of length nSamples (like mu) to each LogisticRegressionFit output, even though they would speed up the score test and first iteration of fitting per variant to not recompute them for every variant.

The model fit function would then take a LogisticRegressionNullFit to use in the first iteration.

Usability,"So I think the root issue here is the unnecessary duplication between `pyRegisterIR` and `pyRegisterIRForServiceBackend`. The only real difference is that one takes and already parsed IR, and the other takes a string and calls the parser. The callers of `pyRegisterIR` in python all call into the parser first, but I don't see any reason it has to make two calls across the python/scala bridge; I think `pyRegisterIR` should just take the IR as a string and call the parser like `pyRegisterIRForServiceBackend` does. With that change, it should be possible to make one a simple wrapper around the other (or maybe even get rid of `pyRegisterIRForServiceBackend` completely). That way the core logic is shared between backends and is getting tested.

Usability,"So my reading now of `seed` is that it uniquely identifies a sequence of numbers.

Usability,"So, here's a profile of the no-leb dataset. I applied all the simple tricks I could think of. We memcpy runs of present ints or floats in arrays. Patrick's improvements. A few other little cleanups. Read bandwidth with one core is ~60MB/s (of uncompressed bytes). Zstd is getting ~28% of our core. A comment from 2019 claimed [200 MB/s](https://github.com/luben/zstd-jni/issues/94#issuecomment-471114842) from the Zstd JNI library we're using. That roughly tracks (0.28 * 200 = 56). The native C library, on a 400MB/s link (roughly my SSD's link) claims closer to 1000 MB/s (of uncompressed bytes) (see [my sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uDYfXWDIwt_-XiclFWdLDiXamVbxhswt_D-v8fVrlRU/edit#gid=0)). I suspect we need either different on-disk formats, different in-memory formats, or vectorized storage to substantially improve the speed. Reading all these tiny arrays is unfortunately really branchy. If we had a PType and EType for arrays that was memcpy-able, that might give us a big win? In particular, suppose we could determine the bytesize of a nested structure including arrays. We write that size into the stream, then write all the bytes. Decoding is: read size, read that many bytes, done. <img width=""1545"" alt=""Screenshot 2023-10-11 at 16 36 27"" src=""https://github.com/hail-is/hail/assets/106194/afaeeacc-ab07-4e2c-9638-8d007276333d"">",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13792#issuecomment-1758518398:62,simpl,simple,62,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13792#issuecomment-1758518398,1,['simpl'],['simple']

Usability,"Some initial thoughts:; * I'm not sure we should have implicitly broadcasting operations in the IR. It seems simpler to make broadcast an explicit operation, which we make sure to deforest. In fact, broadcast is a special case of the generic tensor index operation I'll describe below. Implicitly broadcasting operations could be provided in the Python interface, making broadcasts explicit when constructing the IR.; * I'm also not sure how much special treatment we should give to block matrices in the IR. I now like to think of block matrices as just 4-tensors, with matrix operations like matrix multiplication lowering to operations on 4-tensors. If we allow tensors to have some distributed dimensions and some ""small"" dimensions, then at least in the backend we might not need special handling of block structures. It may still be helpful to have a special block matrix/tensor representation at the top level IR, or maybe that should only live in Pythonâ€”I'm not sure. Here's a proposal for a set of primitive tensor operations. * Outer product: Takes two tensors, T1 and T2, with shapes [n1, ..., ni] and [m1, ..., mj], and entry types t1 and t2, and makes a tensor Out with shape [n1, ..., ni, m1, ..., mj] and entry type (t1, t2). If we want to support sparse tensors, this should take a flag specifying how the sparse structure of the output is determined from those of the inputs. I'll call the possible flags ""and"", ""or"", and ""true"". The ""and"" flag says that Out(n, m) is defined iff T1(n) AND T2(m) are both defined. If we will be multiplying the pairs, or applying any other operation with our default missingness semantics, this is the appropriate setting.; The ""or"" flag says Out(n, m) is defined iff T1(n) OR T2(m) is defined, as is appropriate if we are adding the pairs.; ""true"" just means make Out dense, regardless of the sparsity of the inputs. * Map.

Usability,"Thanks @danking for helping with this, and for the nudge to finally get it implemented!. Some more next steps:; * Make a benchmarking setup to collect data on performance and accuracy. I want to use the same metrics for measuring error as [here](http://quantiles.github.io/) (Kolmogorov-Smirnov divergence and total variation distance between the true and estimated CDFs, which are both simple to compute). As a first sanity check, we should get numbers in the same ballpark as they did (worse at first, because we started with a very naive algorithm).; * Make improvements to the algorithm, evaluating the gains in the benchmarks.; * When we feel we understand the behavior of the accuracy measures, we can pick a conservative upper error bound and turn that into an automated test.; * Also once we understand the behavior of the accuracy measures, figure out how to communicate that to users. One thought is to offer a few default choices of parameters, and for each document memory usage, empirical error from our benchmarks, and a theoretical upper bound on the error (of the form ""with probability > .99 the estimated q quantile element will have true quantile q Â± .001"").

Usability,"Thanks, @tomwhite! This is great. Is there a Hive CLI equivalent of `LIKE PARQUET <file>`? I can't figure out how to get Hive to infer the schema from the Parquet file rather than specifying it explicitly. It would be awesome to be able to query the genotypes, too. It seems like we could write a SerDe (now I'm thinking ImpEx isn't so bad :)) to unpack the genotypes. Does that sound like the right approach?. On a related note, we've played with storing VDS natively as Parquet as (variant, variant annotations, array(genotype)). Even when I ported over some of the GenotypeStream encoding tricks (OD instead of DP, etc.), it was 2-3x larger (using Snappy compression vs. our internal LZ4 compression). That's disappointing, esp. when we have 30+TB datasets on the way. What's worse, simple operations like counting genotypes (`count -g`) are 5-10x in the native representation. Current master:. ```; $ hail importvcf profile225.vcf.bgz write -o profile225.vds read -i profile225.vds count -g; hail: info: timing:; importvcf: 508.829ms; write: 3m6.7s; read: 1.629s; count: 13.934s; $ du -sh profile225.vds; 2.0G profile225.vds; ```. And with the `jg_dataframe1` experimental branch, which uses native Parquet and computes the count using a UDF that computes the sum per array (fastest Parquet-based implementation we've found so far):. ```; $ hail importvcf profile225.vcf.bgz write -o profile225.vds read2 -i profile225.vds count2; hail: info: timing:; importvcf: 492.354ms; write: 5m57.1s; read2: 1.466s; count2: 1m44.1; $ du -sh profile225.vds; 5.4G profile225.vds; ```. That's 2.7x larger and >7x slower. This includes the fact that the Parquet version is only loading the GT field of the genotypes (!). This might be a non-starter for us. We'd love the flexibility and interoperability of standard Parquet.

Usability,"The creeping expansion of the interface is on me as we tried to not break 0.1. I'd appreciate discussing in person what makes the most sense for 0.1. Here are the pieces I think we should separate for devel, though we could consider providing a meta-interface as well that combines some of them for usability. I'm writing (U, S, L) for a local matrix of eigenvectors U, an array of eigenvalues S, and an array of labels L on the rows of U (as with labels for SymmetricMatrix). 1) VDS to a (labeled) symmetric matrix (we have these: GRM, RRM, LD matrix, and Dan is working on a way to read and write them). 2) Symmetric matrix to (U, S, L), which we'll want to write and read. This modularizes the single-core eigen-decomposition bottleneck. 3) Variant-labeled (V, S, L) and VDS with those variants to transport (V, S, L) to sample-labeled (U, S, L). Currently this also requires knowing the number of samples used to make the LDMatrix since that number is used in its normalization. I agree it feels unnatural to need to remember this; to avoid it we'd need an unnormalized version. 4) Sample-labeled (U, S, L) and VDS to global fit of LMM including delta. This is currently a local computation that's been pretty fast in practice but as sample sizes increase we will want to distribute evaluating many values of delta in parallel. Note this step only uses the sample annotations on the VDS, so logically it could also be on KeyTable (which would be the sample KeyTable of the VDS). 5) Sample-labeled (U, S, L), VDS, and delta to per-variant-fit of LMM. This VDS can now contain exactly the variants one wants to fit. (5) should eventually be decomposed as well. The first command should project from Matrix to Matrix (projecting both numeric cells and a list of numeric sample annotations) and some additional small data. Then (6) will do per variant tests starting from after this projection (that is, after what is the BIG computation when you have tens of millions of variants).

Usability,"The doc wasn't very clear about where information lived. I had imagined that the pools and the JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM) owned the information. Nit: the doc doesn't say the instance monitor monitors instances, it just monitors and handles *events*. Let me be explicit: I think the doc is wrong about the monitor doing health checking because that requires it to track the instances, which I just said should be owned by the pools and the JPIM. That didn't occur to me when we were writing the doc, my apologies. I still think the monitor should:; - route events to the right pool or to the JPIM, and; - aggregate summaries up for the web UI. ---. Let me try to be more specific in my critique:. I think of the system as three layers: the top most is the driver, the middle layer is the monitor, and the bottom layer is the pool or JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM). I don't want control flow to go down, up, and back down again. If that happens, then we can't reason about our system as separate layers, we necessarily have to think about the middle and bottom layer together. Very specifically, this flow worries me: (instance pool) create_instance -> (instance monitor) add_instance -> adjust_for_add_instance -> (instance pool) adjust_for_add_instance. We move from low to mid *back to low*. I want information to flow in one direction: either its downward information or its upward information. ---. I'm guessing you're also concerned about code organization / code duplication. I'm not that worried about this. The JPIM and the Pool are similar things and we might inevitably produce some duplication. That's OK with me. To be honest, I think a few stand-alone functions that both of them use will eliminate any code duplication. Both pools and the JPIM will have a `name_instances` and `instance_by_last_updated`. If the duplication gets hard to manage, we might pack that up into another class like InstanceCollection. I realize this means we have several monitoring loops.

The big_mutex is held during constructors, in a way which a) protects the; module_table, and b) makes the transition from ""no lib file"" to ""complete and immutable lib file""; appear atomic, whether that occurs by invoking the makefile, or by writing binary data. Consequently, the makefile is simplified to just build $(MODULE).so without worrying about; atomicity, and the perl rename goes away.

Usability,"The problem I saw was this:. ToStream's invariant is that its children must be TIterable. Given this invariant, in boundary it is not safe to call ToArray on streamified when streamified.isInstanceOf[TStream] and node.typ.isInstanceOf[TArray], because this will miss cases (potentially) when node is a different TIterable, and likewise it is not safe to call ToArray on streamified when node.typ.isInstanceOf[TIterable], because we may inadvertently cast a non-array TIterable to TArray, and thereby break boundary's type invariance. So everywhere that we add a ToStream, we need to perform a check on the child: if it's a non-TArray TIterable, return it, else wrap in ToArray, unless we can be sure we never perform said wrap on a TIterable when streamify is called from boundary. . In the latest commit, I simplified the toStream code, and improved the type check to check not TContainer, but (TIterable && !TStream). This is more precise that checking TContainer alone. That being said I haven't created a convincing test yet (though it's trivially easy to make *a* test: pass a ToStream wrapping a node with typ TDict to boundary, with the old check on boundary, and a TIterable check-before-wrap-in-ToStream in the base case of streamify).

The codegen rule for ArrayRef is now the delightfully clear and concise:. ```; EmitCode.fromI(mb) { cb =>; emit(a).toI(cb).flatMap(cb) { (ac) =>; emit(i).toI(cb).flatMap(cb) { (ic) =>; val av = ac.asIndexable.memoize(cb, ""aref_a""); val iv = cb.memoize(ic.tcode[Int], ""aref_i""). cb.ifx(iv < 0 || iv >= av.loadLength(), {; cb._fatal(errorTransformer(; const(""array index out of bounds: index=""); .concat(iv.toS); .concat("", length=""); .concat(av.loadLength().toS))); }); av.loadElement(cb, iv); }; }; }; ```. Summary of changes:. Introduce CodeBuilder. CodeBuilder allows for the imperative, sequential construction of code. The idea is that it is the imperative analog of Code[Unit]. In this analogy, a function returning Code[Unit] becomes a function that takes a CodeBuilder, alternatively, a Code[Unit] can become a CodeLabel: the place to jump to run a given computation. In addition to CodeBuilder, I have a imperative implementation of EmitCode that is similar to the proposal in the dev post: IEmitCode. Under the above analog, the proposal in the dev post would become:. ```; trait IEmitCode {; def apply(missing: (CodeBuilder) => Unit, present: (CodeBuilder, PValue) => Unit): Unit; }; ```. However, I took the additional step of ""defunctionalizing"" this picture by using labels instead of functions of code, giving:. ```; case class IEmitCode(Lmissing: CodeLabel, Lpresent: CodeLabel, pc: PCode) {; ...; }; ```. In this model, the emit function will become: `Emit.emit(cb: CodeBuilder, ...): IEmitCode`. The discipline is after calling `emit`, the contents of the code builder, when executed, will jump to one of `Lmissing` or `Lpresent` (labels which are not defined yet) and the consumer can define those labels, and use the expression `pc` in the code after the `Lpresent` label only.

Usability,"This change achieves the effect you desire. What I additionally need from this PR is a mental model of why this change works. This change specifies a pixel ratio of two when the device's physical:css pixel ratio is one, but uses the device's pixel ratio otherwise. This breaks my conceptual model. It's important for us all to share compatible models of what the code does so that we all are able to manipulate the code in the future. I think there's a few moving pieces and if we can get a handle on them all, we'll all agree on what the right fix is. AFAICT, three js is built on WebGL. The MDN recommends not using a WebGL `lineWidth` other than one because of inconsistent (or lack of) support for line widths other than one. You observe that `pixelRatio` affects the visual behavior, at least in Safari, when the lineWidth is set to 0.25. In particular, when the pixel ratio is set to `2` and the lineWidth is set to `0.25`, the lines appear thinner. If the pixel ratio is higher than the device pixel ratio, something must be interpolating to device pixels. It seems to me that relying on this interpolation behavior will lead to code that is more difficult to understand and manipulate. If the intention is to make the lines less striking, can we apply an alpha filter instead?

Usability,"This is super cool! I am a big fan of the idea and the overall approach, particularly when it comes to setting up the tmp bucket and getting the permissions on it correct. Here's my high level thoughts. Sorry for the wall of text but I found these a little hard to articulate. ### Regarding number of prompts. I think this is my primary concern. There's a lot of great automation here, but it's a lot right off the bat. I think what this is aiming to do is make it quick and simple to start running batches and every time someone has to stop and ask someone a question as to how they should respond to some prompt that process gets longer and more complicated. I think it's worth considering what the first batch people should run might be and design for a minimal first experience. IMO, a temp bucket is an absolutely crucial piece of configuration before you can do anything interesting and configuring a temp bucket is something that `hailctl` can easily be very opinionated about. Container registryâ€¦ I feel like there's harder questions there, and you can run a lot of cool batches before having to worry about provisioning your own. It's also not actually a part of the hailctl config (unless something has changed recently) so it feels a little unusual in this flow. I still think that it is helpful to set people up with an AR and keep them from footguns, but maybe that can go in a separate command that the initial init command points to once you're done? Something along the lines of ""if you get to the point where you need to upload custom container images, you can use hailctl to set up a registry""?. Another thing that gives me a little pause is the wording around google projects.

Usability,"This looks like good start. A few comments:; - I prefer using MySQL over auth0 mainly because it simplifies our eventual backup/restore story. If you think that's simpler overall, great. I don't see how integrating our db with their service does anything for us.; - I assume you're planning to pull the user data from MySQL during the login flow and add it to cookie? I think @danking @jigold and I are interested in nailing down the format for the cookie and seeing an example.; - I agree with @danking we should have an internal id field that's an integer. I think we should use that everywhere, and just use the auth0 id to look up the user record during login. So the integer id would be the primary key and the auth0 id would be unique with a secondary index.; - You need to get the GCP service account key and store it in a secret.; - The GCP service account needs permissions on the bucket. It should be bucket writer.; - Name ""user_secrets"" seems overly specific (buckets and service accounts are not secrets). ""user_data""?; - Please don't give the database a public IP.; - From a usability perspective, for user-visible names I have to say I really dislike long uuids and like the k8s-style short random string at the end. For k8s resource, you get this for free with the `generate_name` argument. For other stuff, long-term, this will potentially require retry logic to make it robust.; - I don't like this create table logic (FYI @danking @jigold). Most database users should not have permissions to create databases.

Usability,"We need to stop this because the oomkiller (a) acts before the JVM GC can free things and (b) prevents us from getting JVM diagnostics on failure. We control the JVM's max heap with hailctl's --master-memory-fraction (default is 0.8 for 80% of the master machine type's advertised RAM). I suggest we set this down to 0.6 and continue using an n1-highmem-16 driver.; If Hail is (incorrectly) accumulating garbage memory per-group, we'll have a better chance diagnosing that with a running JVM instead of one that's been SIGKILL'ed. To understand what's going on, we gotta see what is using RAM in the n1-highmem-16 case. If I could SSH to the cluster, a simple solution is a screen with top -s 300 -n 100 >memory.log (I'd guess no more than 500KiB per hour of logs) and retrieve that file if the cluster fails. If we could get Google Monitoring set up to retrieve process-level memory statistics from the driver node that should also work. Just to be clear, I don't anticipate any changes to Hail in the next week that would change the memory use of this pipeline. There could be a memory leak, but I have no clews that lead to it. I realize this is an unsatisfying answer. I'm pretty perplexed as to what could be the issue here. #### technical details. We'll call the second to most recent run Run A and the most recent run Run B. Run A (like all runs before it) only manages two sample groups before failing. Run B made it through 50 groups before failing on 51. Why did they fail? The syslog for Run A is clear: the oomkiller killed Run A. We lack syslogs for Run B, so we cannot be certain but the lack of a JVM stack trace suggests to me that (a) the driver failed and (b) the driver was killed by the system.; Let's focus on the driver machines. In Run A, we used an n1-highmem-8 which is advertised to have 52GiB (53248 MiB). In Run B, we used an n1-highmem-16 which is advertised to have 104GiB (106,496 MiB). hailctl sets the JVM max heap size to 80% of the advertised RAM, so 42598 MiB (see ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1832666449:1264,clear,clear,1264,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1832666449,1,['clear'],['clear']

I've found that creating a simple test structure that mimics the desired end result and using the random generator to generate comparison tests (with the count set pretty high) is generally a pretty good way of sanity checking and flushing these bugs out, rather than writing specific test cases---usually if I've written a test for a specific case, I won't have missed it when coding, and if I've missed an edge case when coding, I won't think to test it.

Usability,"Working backwards, we need to not return a 500 on error. We could return a BadRequest error code with the message 'invalid spec' and then handle the MJC database call on the driver. I chose instead to have the worker to post job complete so we get the error message with the stack trace showing up in the UI as having the normal job flow seemed cleaner to me last week then special casing `schedule_job` on the driver. `post job complete` needs a job object to get the status to send back to the driver. However, a `Job` has two concrete implementations and we don't know which the bad job is because we can't get the spec. Furthermore, the `Job` class does a lot of work based on the spec right now. So I thought it was clearer to just create a new class that had the status, but nothing else. After writing this out, it's probably better to have the driver MJC upon error rather than from the worker. The code below would be more complicated. We'd have to get the traceback / error message from the response from the worker. ```python3; try:; await client_session.post(; f'http://{instance.ip_address}:5000/api/v1alpha/batches/jobs/create',; json=body,; timeout=aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=2),; ); await instance.mark_healthy(); except aiohttp.ClientResponseError as e:; await instance.mark_healthy(); if e.status == 403:; log.info(f'attempt already exists for job {id} on {instance}, aborting'); if e.status == 503:; log.info(f'job {id} cannot be scheduled because {instance} is shutting down, aborting'); raise e; except Exception:; await instance.incr_failed_request_count(); raise; ```. And the error handling would look something like this:. ```python3; try:; body = await job_config(app, record, attempt_id); except Exception:; log.exception('while making job config'); status = {; 'version': STATUS_FORMAT_VERSION,; 'worker': None,; 'batch_id': batch_id,; 'job_id': job_id,; 'attempt_id': attempt_id,; 'user': record['user'],; 'state': 'error',; 'error': traceback.format_exc(),; 'container_s",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11391#issuecomment-1048213078:721,clear,clearer,721,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11391#issuecomment-1048213078,1,['clear'],['clearer']

Usability,"ambda:; ```; hl.loop(; lambda sum, ret, i, x:; hl.cond(i < 10, sum(i + 1, x + i), ret(x)),; 0, 0); ```. The second difference is in the typing. In this PR, the `hl.recur` expression is given the type of the entire loop. I would add a single new type `Bottom`, and give all expressions which jump (both the recur and the break expressions) the type `Bottom`. `Bottom` is the empty type, so there can be no closed expressions of type `Bottom`. In the type checker, `Bottom` is only allowed to appear in tail positions, and for `If`, we keep the rule that both branches must have the same type, so either both branches are `Bottom` or neither are. This keeps the semantics simple: an if statement either makes a value or it jumps away, there's no confusing mix. One nice property of this setup is that if an expression has a non-bottom type, then it is guaranteed not to jump away from itself (it may jump internally), so it is safe to method-wrap. This also make codegen very simple, and @iitalics has already implemented it! See `JoinPoint` and `JoinPoint.CallCC`. In the IR, I don't think this requires much change. If we're already adding a continuation context (as mentioned above), then `TailLoop` just needs to bind both a recur and a break continuation, where recur takes the loop variable types, and break takes the loop result type. Then `Recur` can be replaced by a `Jump` node which calls (jumps to) a continuation in context. There's also a middle ground where we make break continuations explicit in the IR, but we want to keep the scheme-like interface in python. Then the pass @cseed described for inferring where the loop exits are would just go in python instead of the emitter. > Using the stream interface seems wrong to me also. When I mentioned this, I was thinking we could reuse the region management logic from the stream emitter for loops, but I've since changed my mind.

Usability,"ar` takes a `Widget` but isn't concerned with its lifetime management, it should take its argument as a `Widget*` or `Widget&`, with the usual reasoning to choose between them. The caller owns the widget, and the lifetime of `bar` is nested inside that of its caller, so lifetime management isn't an issue.; * If `bar` takes a `Widget` and needs to take ownership, it should take its argument as a `unique_ptr<Widget>`. This serves as documentation that the function is taking over responsibility for deleting the Widget, in a way enforced by the compiler.; * A `unique_ptr<Widget>*` or `unique_ptr<Widget>&` is an in-out parameter, where the function needs to be able to point the pointer somewhere else.; * A const pointer or reference to a unique_ptr should never be used. Just pass a raw pointer or reference. Essentially the same rubric should be used for shared_ptr, replacing ""take ownership"" with ""share ownership"". If a function is simply using a value and isn't concerned with its lifetime management, it should be taking a raw pointer or reference, not a shared_ptr. It should be completely agnostic what method the caller is using to manage the lifetime of the object. Herb Sutter gives his typical thorough analysis of this question [here](https://herbsutter.com/2013/06/05/gotw-91-solution-smart-pointer-parameters/). > I would be fine with that extra learning curve and complexity if unique_ptr solved a difficult; problem. But - by definition! - it doesn't. It only works for the easy case where you have one; pointer to each object. The invariant that unique_ptr is designed to keep isn't that there is only one pointer to each object. There can be any number of aliases, changing over time, but at any time exactly one must be a unique_ptr, which documents which alias is the ""owner"". The design of and idioms around unique_ptr ensure that all non-owning aliases have lifetimes which are nested inside the lifetime of the owning pointer, and that ownership can be passed around unam",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3718#issuecomment-396669638:2365,simpl,simply,2365,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3718#issuecomment-396669638,1,['simpl'],['simply']

Seems that the simplest issue may be to increase `read_timeout` past 120 seconds, although depending on the causes of this issue, that may not eliminate the problem, and of course leaves a long delay, which may be unacceptable for the use-case. As for why read takes so long: not 100% sure yet, setting up batch and CI is still incomplete, and I have not triggered this error myself. My guess is that Kubernetes takes too long to generate the response, either due to garbage collection, or simply because the requested information takes N > 120 seconds to return. That would be a very long time for any reasonable response, so either the resource isn't ready and it waits, or there are network connectivity issues. If network issues, not sure what solutions are.

Python is not very good choice for high performance system in any case...For me high performance python is a fantasy, but i donâ€™t do aiohttp/python anymore. In the end it is up to @asvetlov"". from one of the creators of aiohttp, I'm not encouraged about the long-term health of the project. https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2902. In the second branch related to this pull request, linked above, I chose Starlette, and it is a thin abstraction, nearly identical performance, over Uvicorn + httptools, which were both written by Yury Selivanov, the asyncio person I mention above. Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 . Starlette is something like base Go performance (though 1/5-1/10th the performance of Go's fasthttp library for simple responses, and much closer for anything involving database calls). Sanic also uses httptools and uvloop, but has more stuff.. so yeah maybe a bit slower than Starlette, or not, but the diff will probably be small. Regarding the benchmark you linked, it is benchmarking the power of sleep. There is something deeply wrong with their results. Sanic has 1800 timeouts, vs 200 for aiohttp, and 3x the connection errors. Fine, so Sanic is super slow. But look at their non-db tests. Sanic is >2x as fast, 0 timeouts. They aren't using anything Sanic specific to query the database, and both use the same event loop. Adding asyncio Postgres to two programs that fundamentally differ mainly in how the handle http requests and responses, shows the one that is faster at http requests/responses (Sanic) becoming much slower, and in fact reversing its relationship to Aiohttp.

Usability,"cated. I think it's worth considering what the first batch people should run might be and design for a minimal first experience. IMO, a temp bucket is an absolutely crucial piece of configuration before you can do anything interesting and configuring a temp bucket is something that `hailctl` can easily be very opinionated about. Container registryâ€¦ I feel like there's harder questions there, and you can run a lot of cool batches before having to worry about provisioning your own. It's also not actually a part of the hailctl config (unless something has changed recently) so it feels a little unusual in this flow. I still think that it is helpful to set people up with an AR and keep them from footguns, but maybe that can go in a separate command that the initial init command points to once you're done? Something along the lines of ""if you get to the point where you need to upload custom container images, you can use hailctl to set up a registry""?. Another thing that gives me a little pause is the wording around google projects. I get that you need one to create a bucket, but I think we should just make sure to steer clear of the implication that you are ""selecting a GCP project to use for Hail Batch"", because that implies some link or ownership that isn't there. But I think there's a quick fix here: for a given resource that we *are* creating for hail use, like the temp bucket, ask for the name first and then ask which project it should be created in, using the projects listed in gcloud as choices with the option to write in your own. ### Regarding number of checks; I think it'd be good to avoid warnings when possible.

Usability,"crossposting from a message I sent to the variants team. ---. #### executive summary. Excess JVM memory use is almost certainly not the issue. I've taken a close look at the import_gvs.py loop and the related Hail Python code. No obvious accumulation of RAM use. AFAICT, the oomkiller keeps killing the pipelines. We need to stop this because the oomkiller (a) acts before the JVM GC can free things and (b) prevents us from getting JVM diagnostics on failure. We control the JVM's max heap with hailctl's --master-memory-fraction (default is 0.8 for 80% of the master machine type's advertised RAM). I suggest we set this down to 0.6 and continue using an n1-highmem-16 driver.; If Hail is (incorrectly) accumulating garbage memory per-group, we'll have a better chance diagnosing that with a running JVM instead of one that's been SIGKILL'ed. To understand what's going on, we gotta see what is using RAM in the n1-highmem-16 case. If I could SSH to the cluster, a simple solution is a screen with top -s 300 -n 100 >memory.log (I'd guess no more than 500KiB per hour of logs) and retrieve that file if the cluster fails. If we could get Google Monitoring set up to retrieve process-level memory statistics from the driver node that should also work. Just to be clear, I don't anticipate any changes to Hail in the next week that would change the memory use of this pipeline. There could be a memory leak, but I have no clews that lead to it. I realize this is an unsatisfying answer. I'm pretty perplexed as to what could be the issue here. #### technical details. We'll call the second to most recent run Run A and the most recent run Run B. Run A (like all runs before it) only manages two sample groups before failing. Run B made it through 50 groups before failing on 51. Why did they fail? The syslog for Run A is clear: the oomkiller killed Run A. We lack syslogs for Run B, so we cannot be certain but the lack of a JVM stack trace suggests to me that (a) the driver failed and (b) the drive",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1832666449:967,simpl,simple,967,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/13960#issuecomment-1832666449,1,['simpl'],['simple']

This is passed through, but --py-files is needed (it is not passed through, but modified). Do I leave --files? I'm currently inclined to. Agreed. I support having the most frequently used parameters as `hailctl` parameters, even if they are only simple pass throughs. My original comment about minimizing the number of simple pass through parameters was mainly directed toward `hailctl dataproc start`, which has several options than can be specified separately for master node, worker nodes, and secondary worker nodes. I wanted to avoid cases where, for example, `--worker-boot-disk-size` was a `hailctl` option, but `--secondary-worker-boot-disk-size` had to be specified after a `--` or with `--extra-gcloud-start-args`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9842#issuecomment-767168393:3155,simpl,simple,3155,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9842#issuecomment-767168393,2,['simpl'],['simple']
Usability,"es into a per-process directory and using in-memory (std::mutex) synchronization.; But y'know, given that we have to write the DLL's out, it just seemed natural to let them persist; (and until debugging it on MacOS, I thought I could manage it with nothing but atomic file-create; and atomic-rename, but that didn't quite pan out). As for writing LLVM IR, it can definitely be done, because that's what Endeca/Oracle did. But there; was such a huge learning curve that only 3 people ever did it successfully (I wasn't one of them),; and debugging seemed very unpleasant and slow. [It was also a masterful achievement in ; job-security-through-obscurity, because no-one in management was going to mess with the; two people who wrote it - until the whole project got canned]. ... and in the time I was there, the Endeca/Oracle stuff wasn't distributed, which could be another; place where the generate-LLVM-IR needs some kind of extra glue for distributing compiled code,; whereas the conventional DLL's are trivial to ship around. Not claiming that part of it is difficult,; just that it didn't happen at Oracle until long after I left. In contrast, at PhysicsSpeed it was fairly smooth to implement nice abstractions (dense-join-table,; hash-join-table, tuple-with-order) as template classes which could be tested and debugged; in a standalone environment, and then have simpler codegen using those abstractions. At least,; that's a good way to get a lot of functionality with modest effort - and it doesn't preclude migrating; towards a more complex codegen later. It's nice to be able to have templates as low-runtime-cost; abstractions, but you don't have to use them if you don't want to. In short, most of the usual arguments about the benefits of HLL's apply.

Usability,"es the source) and the somewhat bizarre terminology and syntax; used to express that in C++. I agree that move semantics takes getting used to, but I think it is much too integrated into modern C++ to ignore, going far beyond unique_ptr. Writing interfaces that take advantage of move semantics requires understanding rvalue-references in more detail, but for users of those move-enabled interfaces I think the guidelines are easy to teach: a variable will only be modified by moving if it is explicitly tagged with a `std::move`, so all you have to remember is ""after a `std::move(foo)`, the variable `foo` may only be assigned to or deleted."". > And then you get into a whole host of associated design decisions (I'm holding this as a unique_ptr,; but I want to pass it to a function - should I pass it as a raw pointer ? a raw reference ? a reference; to the unique_ptr ?). Keeping in mind the model that letting a function/class `foo` hold a `unique_ptr<Widget>` means explicitly ""`foo` owns this Widget, and is responsible for deleting it or passing ownership somewhere else"", these questions have pretty clear answers. * If a function `bar` takes a `Widget` but isn't concerned with its lifetime management, it should take its argument as a `Widget*` or `Widget&`, with the usual reasoning to choose between them. The caller owns the widget, and the lifetime of `bar` is nested inside that of its caller, so lifetime management isn't an issue.; * If `bar` takes a `Widget` and needs to take ownership, it should take its argument as a `unique_ptr<Widget>`. This serves as documentation that the function is taking over responsibility for deleting the Widget, in a way enforced by the compiler.; * A `unique_ptr<Widget>*` or `unique_ptr<Widget>&` is an in-out parameter, where the function needs to be able to point the pointer somewhere else.; * A const pointer or reference to a unique_ptr should never be used.

Usability,"icate is signed by the same root certificate. I think using a root cert is quite secure (a big improvement over our current situation!). However, I endeavored in this PR to additionally prevent, for example, a compromised `notebook` from masquerading as `batch`. I agree that additionally verifying that the certificate came from a single root certificate (that we, perhaps, destroy after everything is signed) would additionally prevent a malicious user from inserting their certificates into the trusted certificates list. AFAICT, python's `ssl` module has no support for this verification strategy. We could probably build an SSLContext shim that contained two SSLContexts one with a root cert and one with the trusted certs and require certification verification to pass both. Seems easy to get wrong, so I'm inclined to not take this path. ### trusted cert lists. Yeah, it felt a little silly to duplicate the cert in each secret. However, this seems like the simplest approach if I require each principal to only trust a subset of incoming/outgoing principals. If I had one secret per principal, then I have to modify build.yaml or deployment.yamls if I modify the trust sets. That seemed error prone. If I had one secret with all the certs, then when a service starts up it has to select the trusted ones and only insert those into its certificate store. This seems OK, but a little harder to inspect. Duplicating a cert for each trust list to which it belongs occupies what seems like a good spot to me from a developer ergonomics perspective:; - O(trusts) modifications necessary to update/revoke the cert; - O(1) configuration to load a trust list; - no pod-start-time configuration; - the trust list is on the container's file system, so its easy to inspect. Small point: I don't pin the incoming certs yet due to the mTLS challenges. ### create on each deploy. Only creating certs if they don't exist is an easy change. Seems fine, though leaves unresolved how to rotate the certs.

As for why read takes so long: not 100% sure yet, setting up batch and CI is still incomplete, and I have not triggered this error myself. My guess is that Kubernetes takes too long to generate the response, either due to garbage collection, or simply because the requested information takes N > 120 seconds to return.

Usability,"ittle unusual in this flow. I still think that it is helpful to set people up with an AR and keep them from footguns, but maybe that can go in a separate command that the initial init command points to once you're done? Something along the lines of ""if you get to the point where you need to upload custom container images, you can use hailctl to set up a registry""?. Another thing that gives me a little pause is the wording around google projects. I get that you need one to create a bucket, but I think we should just make sure to steer clear of the implication that you are ""selecting a GCP project to use for Hail Batch"", because that implies some link or ownership that isn't there. But I think there's a quick fix here: for a given resource that we *are* creating for hail use, like the temp bucket, ask for the name first and then ask which project it should be created in, using the projects listed in gcloud as choices with the option to write in your own. ### Regarding number of checks; I think it'd be good to avoid warnings when possible. From looking at this I see a pattern of; 1. Ask a leading question; 2. Emit a warning if the user selects the alternative option instead of the suggested option. I think I would prefer instead to ask a leading question and in the prompt explain why the alternative option might be undesirable. Then when they make a decision just move on. On a broader note, I think we should focus on having good documentation and linking to it over having perfectly thorough ; explanations in the CLI. At some point in an interactive setup if it gets longwinded I start spamming enter, but if it was quick and at the end it said something to the effect of: ""Your current configuration could result in excess cloud cost. See the documentation <here> about common pitfalls and how to avoid them"", I might decide to read through that FAQ with a more discerning eye.

Usability,"ld implement convenience methods for building while/for loops if we decide it's worth it. > Giving each loop a name seems natural. Apart from the wrapping issue (the greatest existential threat our generation faces) I don't see any problem calling an outer loop from an inner loop. Also agree. This will require either adding another context of loops/continuations in the environment (valid places to jump to, and their argument types), or keeping them in the normal value context by adding a new continuation type. > Is Patrick's proposal for extra types written up anywhere?. My proposal has two main differences. In; ```; hl.loop(; lambda i, x:; hl.cond(i < 10, hl.recur(i + 1, x + i), x),; 0, 0); ```; the point that jumps back to the top of the loop is explicit, but the point that jumps out of the loop is not. I suggested making this something like; ```; hl.loop(; lambda i, x:; hl.cond(i < 10, hl.recur(i + 1, x + i), hl.break(x)),; 0, 0); ```; or, if we're giving names to loops, it might be simpler to pass the break and recur functions to the lambda:; ```; hl.loop(; lambda sum, ret, i, x:; hl.cond(i < 10, sum(i + 1, x + i), ret(x)),; 0, 0); ```. The second difference is in the typing. In this PR, the `hl.recur` expression is given the type of the entire loop. I would add a single new type `Bottom`, and give all expressions which jump (both the recur and the break expressions) the type `Bottom`. `Bottom` is the empty type, so there can be no closed expressions of type `Bottom`. In the type checker, `Bottom` is only allowed to appear in tail positions, and for `If`, we keep the rule that both branches must have the same type, so either both branches are `Bottom` or neither are. This keeps the semantics simple: an if statement either makes a value or it jumps away, there's no confusing mix. One nice property of this setup is that if an expression has a non-bottom type, then it is guaranteed not to jump away from itself (it may jump internally), so it is safe to method-wrap.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7614#issuecomment-559072407:1265,simpl,simpler,1265,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7614#issuecomment-559072407,1,['simpl'],['simpler']

Usability,"nformation. Nit: the doc doesn't say the instance monitor monitors instances, it just monitors and handles *events*. Let me be explicit: I think the doc is wrong about the monitor doing health checking because that requires it to track the instances, which I just said should be owned by the pools and the JPIM. That didn't occur to me when we were writing the doc, my apologies. I still think the monitor should:; - route events to the right pool or to the JPIM, and; - aggregate summaries up for the web UI. ---. Let me try to be more specific in my critique:. I think of the system as three layers: the top most is the driver, the middle layer is the monitor, and the bottom layer is the pool or JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM). I don't want control flow to go down, up, and back down again. If that happens, then we can't reason about our system as separate layers, we necessarily have to think about the middle and bottom layer together. Very specifically, this flow worries me: (instance pool) create_instance -> (instance monitor) add_instance -> adjust_for_add_instance -> (instance pool) adjust_for_add_instance. We move from low to mid *back to low*. I want information to flow in one direction: either its downward information or its upward information. ---. I'm guessing you're also concerned about code organization / code duplication. I'm not that worried about this. The JPIM and the Pool are similar things and we might inevitably produce some duplication. That's OK with me. To be honest, I think a few stand-alone functions that both of them use will eliminate any code duplication. Both pools and the JPIM will have a `name_instances` and `instance_by_last_updated`. If the duplication gets hard to manage, we might pack that up into another class like InstanceCollection. I realize this means we have several monitoring loops. I'm not very worried about that. I think it's fine and it helps simplify the architecture. It avoids entangling the monitor with the pools and the JPIM.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9772#issuecomment-738515358:2051,simpl,simplify,2051,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9772#issuecomment-738515358,1,['simpl'],['simplify']

If we could get Google Monitoring set up to retrieve process-level memory statistics from the driver node that should also work.

Run B made it through 50 groups before failing on 51. Why did they fail? The syslog for Run A is clear: the oomkiller killed Run A. We lack syslogs for Run B, so we cannot be certain but the lack of a JVM stack trace suggests to me that (a) the driver failed and (b) the driver was killed by the system.; Let's focus on the driver machines.

In Run A (the only run for which we have syslogs), based on the driver's syslog, before Spark starts, the system has already allocated 8500 MiB to Linux/Google/Dataproc daemons. Moreover, the actual RAM of the system (as reported by the earlyoom daemon) is 52223 MiB (51 GiB, 1GiB less than Google advertises for n1-highmem-8).

Usability,"s explicit, but the point that jumps out of the loop is not. I suggested making this something like; ```; hl.loop(; lambda i, x:; hl.cond(i < 10, hl.recur(i + 1, x + i), hl.break(x)),; 0, 0); ```; or, if we're giving names to loops, it might be simpler to pass the break and recur functions to the lambda:; ```; hl.loop(; lambda sum, ret, i, x:; hl.cond(i < 10, sum(i + 1, x + i), ret(x)),; 0, 0); ```. The second difference is in the typing. In this PR, the `hl.recur` expression is given the type of the entire loop. I would add a single new type `Bottom`, and give all expressions which jump (both the recur and the break expressions) the type `Bottom`. `Bottom` is the empty type, so there can be no closed expressions of type `Bottom`. In the type checker, `Bottom` is only allowed to appear in tail positions, and for `If`, we keep the rule that both branches must have the same type, so either both branches are `Bottom` or neither are. This keeps the semantics simple: an if statement either makes a value or it jumps away, there's no confusing mix. One nice property of this setup is that if an expression has a non-bottom type, then it is guaranteed not to jump away from itself (it may jump internally), so it is safe to method-wrap. This also make codegen very simple, and @iitalics has already implemented it! See `JoinPoint` and `JoinPoint.CallCC`. In the IR, I don't think this requires much change. If we're already adding a continuation context (as mentioned above), then `TailLoop` just needs to bind both a recur and a break continuation, where recur takes the loop variable types, and break takes the loop result type. Then `Recur` can be replaced by a `Jump` node which calls (jumps to) a continuation in context. There's also a middle ground where we make break continuations explicit in the IR, but we want to keep the scheme-like interface in python. Then the pass @cseed described for inferring where the loop exits are would just go in python instead of the emitter. > Using",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7614#issuecomment-559072407:1989,simpl,simple,1989,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7614#issuecomment-559072407,1,['simpl'],['simple']

Usability,"sses that backslash and newline to the shell. In Make 3.81, the `\` was also required but the newline and backslash *are not passed* to the shell. In other words: in 3.81, backslash-newline is always replaced with a space and in 4.0, backslash-newline is replaced with a space *except on recipe lines in which case it is necessary to indicate the recipe continues but it is also passed literally to the shell*. The docs page you linked directly addresses our use case and suggests we put the command inside of a make variable (thus triggering normal backslash-newline rules rather than the special recipe line rules). > Sometimes you want to split a long line inside of single quotes, but you donâ€™t want the backslash/newline to appear in the quoted content. This is often the case when passing scripts to languages such as Perl, where extraneous backslashes inside the script can change its meaning or even be a syntax error. One simple way of handling this is to place the quoted string, or even the entire command, into a make variable then use the variable in the recipe. In this situation the newline quoting rules for makefiles will be used, and the backslash/newline will be removed.

It seems to me like there are not any great choices. Putting the JSON into a Make variable seems too magical and likely to confuse a newbie editing this file.

Usability,"tely crucial piece of configuration before you can do anything interesting and configuring a temp bucket is something that `hailctl` can easily be very opinionated about. Container registryâ€¦ I feel like there's harder questions there, and you can run a lot of cool batches before having to worry about provisioning your own. It's also not actually a part of the hailctl config (unless something has changed recently) so it feels a little unusual in this flow. I still think that it is helpful to set people up with an AR and keep them from footguns, but maybe that can go in a separate command that the initial init command points to once you're done? Something along the lines of ""if you get to the point where you need to upload custom container images, you can use hailctl to set up a registry""?. Another thing that gives me a little pause is the wording around google projects. I get that you need one to create a bucket, but I think we should just make sure to steer clear of the implication that you are ""selecting a GCP project to use for Hail Batch"", because that implies some link or ownership that isn't there. But I think there's a quick fix here: for a given resource that we *are* creating for hail use, like the temp bucket, ask for the name first and then ask which project it should be created in, using the projects listed in gcloud as choices with the option to write in your own. ### Regarding number of checks; I think it'd be good to avoid warnings when possible. From looking at this I see a pattern of; 1. Ask a leading question; 2. Emit a warning if the user selects the alternative option instead of the suggested option. I think I would prefer instead to ask a leading question and in the prompt explain why the alternative option might be undesirable. Then when they make a decision just move on.

Usability,"with the new mypy update, mypy complains if we don't use the type stubs for our dependencies. This is fixed in main (we add the type stubs) but not in the previously released pip hail, because well it's already released. One option is we decide we don't like this requirement and disable that for mypy (though I do enjoy having the type hints). The problem remains that we lint the released version with the `setup.cfg` on main, so this will fail if we ever tighten our linting.
