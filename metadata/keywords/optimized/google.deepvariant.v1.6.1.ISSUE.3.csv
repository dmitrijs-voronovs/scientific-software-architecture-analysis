Energy Efficiency,"Hello jessieshen97,. In order to train a good model you need to run make_examples on multiple sets on different coverages. Internally we use Google scheduler with thousands of hosts. You may try to do it on one machine but it may be challenging. ; To answer you question, yes you can train a DeepTrio model of the diploid organism. Although, we don't have a document with detailed steps on training a DeepTrio model you can try following the steps for DeepVariant toy model training. The only difference is that you need to use DeepTrio make_examples.

Energy Efficiency,"Hello! I've found a performance issue in deepvariant/data_providers.py: `batch()` should be called before `map()`, which could make your program more efficient. Here is [the tensorflow document](https://tensorflow.google.cn/guide/data_performance?hl=zh_cn#vectorized_mapping) to support it. Detailed description is listed below:. - deepvariant/data_providers.py: `dataset.batch(batch_size=batch_size, drop_remainder=True)`[(here)](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/1c1d220f36ac8b9018872adc3d9bcde8ae43d84a/deepvariant/data_providers.py#L316) should be called before `dataset.map(map_func=self.parse_tfexample, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)`[(here)](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/1c1d220f36ac8b9018872adc3d9bcde8ae43d84a/deepvariant/data_providers.py#L314).; - deepvariant/data_providers.py: `dataset.batch(batch_size=batch_size)`[(here)](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/1c1d220f36ac8b9018872adc3d9bcde8ae43d84a/deepvariant/data_providers.py#L364) should be called before `dataset.map(map_func=self.parse_tfexample, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)`[(here)](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/1c1d220f36ac8b9018872adc3d9bcde8ae43d84a/deepvariant/data_providers.py#L362). Besides, you need to check the function called in `map()`(e.g., `self.parse_tfexample` called in `dataset.map()`) whether to be affected or not to make the changed code work properly. For example, if `self.parse_tfexample` needs data with shape (x, y, z) as its input before fix, it would require data with shape (batch_size, x, y, z). Looking forward to your reply.

Energy Efficiency,"Hello, ; I think the answer is ""yes I could"". To be quick ... I have 25 datasets of high-coverage illumina data. But mapping them on the rotifer genomes is a nightmare, it seems there are many mismappings. But ... we finally start to have enough material to get long ONT precise reads (the very last one that is accurate at 99.99%, just like a giant PCR); those are much less likely to mismap, and Clair3 seems extremely powerful and precise to call. Therefore, we could consider the call from long reads as a ""truth set"". . My point is if I give deep variant the ONT ""truth set"" and then the mapping of short illumina reads. Could it be retrained to understand the mapping and calling issues with this kind of genome? I don't have a ""rule"" such as Mendelian violation because my organism is clonal. Therefore, the only possibility of having a ""truth set"" is to trust long reads mapping (Sanger sequencing doesn't work well either; we don't know why). . Is it something doable? I could use other things, such as Python random forests, as suggested by a colleague, but since you have spent a lot of time trying to help me, before, I found it gentlemanly to ask if we can use Deepvariant.; I think the answer is ""Yes, I could"". To be quick ... I have 25 datasets of high-coverage Illumina data. And I'm not sure I will get those datasets resequenced in long reads with enough coverage and N50 (for another reason we don't understand well, DNA extraction is harrowing in rotifers; it often fails or yields highly damaged DNA). Therefore, if I could retrain a model to use the Illumina datasets, that would be great. . My worries are: what does it take in terms of hardware to retrain Deepvariant? I don't have access to a huge GPU. . I found this tutorial: https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md . but I am not sure if it is adapted to my case, streamlined, or can be done here, if I understand well this example relies on using Google machines, right?.

Energy Efficiency,"Hello,. I've been using DeepTrio for de novo variant analysis, and it's been performing excellently. However, I noticed from the logs that DeepTrio uses the CPU to prepare data, which is quite time-consuming. In my case, it took 12 hours for one trio analysis, with an additional 4 hours on the GPU. Given that renting GPU servers( usually with less CPU) is more expensive than CPU servers and access to privately owned GPU servers is limited, it seems inefficient to run lengthy CPU processes on a GPU server. It feels like a bit of a waste, and sometimes I half-jokingly feel there might be someone out there with murderous intent because of it!. Would it be possible in future updates to partition the DeepTrio analysis into separate steps? This way, CPU-intensive tasks could be completed on a CPU server, and then the job could be transferred to a GPU server for the remaining tasks. Alternatively, could the data preparation (CPU) and analysis (GPU) be run at the same time? This would help optimize resource usage and reduce costs.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi @Axze-rgb,. This clearly tells me that your organism is highly sensitive under selective pressure. So let's think what might happen if you used Clair3. Clair3 has both a full-alignment network (ResNet), and a pileup network (Bi-LSTM). . Bi-LSTM is just a recurrent neural network that is memory efficient to remember past events without gradient instabilities, by going through the input forward and in reverse while getting output information from the previous step. All this means is that it has a bunch of weights and biases that the input (and previous output) progresses through in a time-series-like pattern -- traversing the input data both forward and in reverse -- remembering internally long-term dependencies stored as states. This means it is fairly memory efficient and fairly fast. In terms of sequence it captures the variants given a progression known by past progressions. As an analogy, given sequence of historical stock prices, can you predict the future stock price. Instead of stock price it produces variants. The ResNet is helpful to train faster as it is uses skip (shortcut) connection by utilizing the residual difference of input and output to learn from (residual learning). They use spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) for variable coverage of full-alignments. This still a convolutional neural network of weights and biases. It still operates like DeepVariant on channels constructed from your read information (`reference_base`, `alternative_base`, `mapping_quality`, `base_quality`, `strand_info`, `variant_type`, `insert_base`, `phasing_info`). What does this mean for you? We know your organism adapts significantly to the external environment. The deep learning models -- either DeepVariant or Clair3 -- have semi-fixed input assumptions. Sure they have been trained with some flexibility in the input data to capture some variability, but not to the extent that they will adapt to significant allele, or possible structural variation.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi @BowenKwan . I dug into this a bit and I think it is working as expected. Here are some take aways:. There are 57238 total examples in the exome. * On a batch_size 32 on 64 cores runs this runs at 0.67 sec per 100 [from pichuan] with total runtime 6m 21s. Expected runtime is 57238 / 100 * 0.67 seconds = 6m so this is all matching. * With a batch_size 32 on a GCE 8 cores instance DV 0.6 runs at 2.53 sec per 100, so expected runtime is 57238 / 100 * 2.53 seconds = 24 min. * The expected run rate (assuming perfect scaling from 64 => 8) is 0.67 * 8 = 5.36 sec per 100. This is 2x larger than the observed rate [in the positive direction] because 64 cores isn't as well utilized as 8 cores.

This changes how many examples are generated and could lead to a 8 hr runtime of call_variants even at 2.53 secs per 100.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi @JosephLalli . At the time we were putting together the vg-giraffe paper, we noticed that Indel errors would occur because the positioning of read indel events in the CIGAR string were not always left-normalized. ABRA both fixed that issue and also seems to give some additional advantage by standardizing the representation before running the candidate generation in DeepVariant. Subsequent to that finding, both ourselves and the vg team built methods which left-normalize Indel CIGAR events during processing. We found that this reduced almost all, but not quite all, of the Indel performance difference with ABRA processed reads. Because we have built the DeepVariant vg pipeline to include read normalization with the --normalize_reads=true tag, we don't routinely benchmark the two methods against each other. Our last head-to-head benchmark on ABRA on and off on 35x HG003 was no_ABRA Indel F1=0.9953, with ABRA Indel F1=0.9958. @pichuan Has made [this linked gist](https://gist.github.com/pichuan/eedab4cf2e06fa7ceb2fad0f9b3f8066) that we use for efficient, single machine processing of vg giraffe+DeepVariant. We opted not to include the use of ABRA realignment in that pipeline.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi @PengJia6 . Please see ; ![This IGV screenshot](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/583711/1a448812-6b85-4614-bbda-6504595a50af). which shows the reads after rolling back to FASTQ and mapping with different parameters (top row) versus the original alignments (bottom row) for one of the samples. You can see the top row has a consistent representation in the reads. I mapped these with pbmm2 using `--preset HiFi`. However, you should be able to replicate this effect in minimap using the flag `-ax map-hifi`. If remapping is an option, this will be the cleanest way to improve these cases. If you are considering remapping, I want to mention that we recommend mapping to a version of GRCh38 without ALT contigs (for example [GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fasta.gz](https://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ReferenceSamples/giab/release/references/GRCh38/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fasta.gz). We observe this to have higher accuracy across technologies, but it makes an especially large difference for long read technologies. I also note that you are using DeepVariant v1.1, but your BAM files don't have HaplotypePhase labels from running WhatsHap. Before version v1.4, we recommend a 2 step process of call-phase-call with WhatsHap in the middle for phasing. At version v1.4 and later, we started to do the phasing within DeepVariant, eliminating the need for this.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi @SHuang-Broad,. Thank you both for the detailed statistics background information. For PEPPER - we're now not using the code from that approach and instead are using the make_examples logic in DeepVariant. However, you conclusion will still be correct. Within make_examples and even call_variants we're still not using the GPU to its fullest capability. Improving GPU utilization is an area we could make progress on. However, the skill profile of the team will allow us to do the work, but not as quickly as for groups that have more experience optimizing GPU performance. As a result, we don't feel that our team's leverage is as high for that work as opposed to other projects. We may get to it eventually, but it will probably remain lower priority. @pgrosu Thank you for the I/O profile. We have also flagged I/O as a bottleneck and area for improvement in DeepVariant in general. At this time, for speed improvements, we are looking into optimizations which reduce the amount of data being passed back and forth for various function calls. This seems to us to be the most engineer-time efficient way to speed up DeepVariant currently. I am hopeful that this will result in runtime improvements in the next 1 or 2 releases. This should benefit both CPU and GPU ways of running.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi @WeiweiBian . In our discussion over email, I recommended that you use a somatic caller instead of trying to adapt DeepVariant to your needs, and I still think this is the best way to go. To answer your questions:; 1. No, this is a limit within Inception V3 that DeepVariant uses.; 2. We don't have any other training tutorials for other systems.; 3. We have done some exploratory work on a somatic variant caller, but it is not available yet, and it is meant for tumor-normal pairs with much lower coverage and higher allele frequency. It will not be possible to use this for your case. I think you would be much better off using a somatic variant caller for your research.; If you want to take transforming DeepVariant into a somatic caller on as a research project, you are welcome to do so, since it's open source.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi @anands-repo . You are correct, subsampling is static. A nice effect of this is that it reduces the complexity in terms of training reproducibility. We have not deeply investigated whether dynamic resampling (making a different image per epoch) would benefit training. It's an interesting question. It could potentially reduce overfitting that might occur at the read level and therefore allow training to progress through more epochs before a model is selected. . I think it is unlikely that this would improve the current production training setup, but it is not impossible. For the WGS training curves, there is little overfitting apparent in training graphs over a large number of epochs. For the WES training curves, some overfitting is apparent, but we suspect this is less due to signal from the read level and more due to the smaller number of regions represented in the exome. This is one reason that we currently train the exome model by warmstarting from the WGS model. It is probably worth us taking a look at some point, but likely isn't the lowest hanging fruit for us to improve performance.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi @anands-repo,. Thanks for the question. You are correct that in these cases we are semantically treating GT=0 to be ""non-ALT""; the goal of the haplotypes.py library is to try to resolve cases where the raw calls indicate more than two alternate alleles at a single base pair. This can occur because DeepVariant processes each candidate variant independently, and sometimes candidates overlap the same stretch of the reference genome. As you observed in the code, the haplotypes.py library is even still just a ""best effort"" and there are cases where > 2 alternate alleles will still be emitted by the algorithm. Regarding your prevalence comment, empirically on the Genome in a Bottle HG002 sample we observed this library reduce the number of regions with > 2 alternate alleles from ~3000 to ~300 when it was first introduced.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi @husamia . Thank you for the question. The answer is a big complex. To summarize your question it is roughly. ```; The biggest issue that we have in calling de novos is managing ""false positive"" de novo events - not necessarily where the proband call is incorrect, but where a 0/1-0/0-0/0 call should be (for example 0/1-0/1-0/0). Will DeepTrio reduce the number of these calls.; ```. Calls in DeepVariant which are 0/1-0/0-0/0 where a human inspection in IGV shows evidence in the parent are generally caused by:. 1. Reads which have a MAPQ below the threshold that DeepVariant sees (MAPQ < 5). ; 2. Regions which DeepVariant seems to think may represent a segmental duplication where reads are mapped from a different region. In these cases, DeepVariant can all a position as 0/0. In terms of overall precision, DeepTrio has higher precision on de novo calls (0/1-0/0-0/0) than DeepVariant [tables for this are in the manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.05.438434v1). In the cases that you mention, DeepTrio will more often designate the parent as a nocall (0/1-./.-0/0) for example. The genotype quality in the parents in DeepTrio can be useful for reducing the Type II error that you mention. If you want to further reduce these positions, I expect it would be possible to post-filter using the coverage values for the parent calls in the VCF (further filtering those that have a reasonable number of AD for ALT reads). We'll also consider whether including that during the VCF generation could make sense.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi @mclaugsf,. Let me give you a bit more context here on the runtime of call_variants. call_variants is the deep learning component of DeepVariant, so it relies on TensorFlow to execute the inception_v3 model used to evaluate our genotype likelihoods. In the 0.7 case study, make_examples creates 5,847,041 genomic tensors that need to be evaluated. When executing using CPUs, TensorFlow by default uses all of the available cores on the machine. So in our case study, which runs on a 64 core machine, we are using all 64 cores to evaluate these tensors. . So a rough estimate of the core-hours needed for the DeepVariant WGS case is:. 64 cores * 205 minutes of runtime ~= 219 core hours ~= 9 days. So if you are running on a machine with a single core, you should see call_variants take ~9 days. This is a bit of an over-estimate because 64 cores isn't 64x more efficient than 1 core. . Based on your 1 day turn around I'd guess you are running on a machine with 8 cores. Note these numbers assume you are using a modern CPU with AVX etc instruction sets. Not having those can increase the runtime by ~4x or so. Also I want to ask - in your original post are you processing exomes? If so, are you providing a capture regions bed to make_examples? Normally an exome produces < 100k examples (contrast that with 5.8M in a whole genome) so the runtime should be 60x less on an exome. That means instead of 9 days on a single core you are looking at 3.5 hours.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/105#issuecomment-430736386:864,efficient,efficient,864,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/105#issuecomment-430736386,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

Energy Efficiency,"Hi @tinyfallen . @pgrosu is correct, the most efficient way is to run DeepVariant individually and then merge with GLnexus. One point to make, GLnexus runs quite quickly relative to the variant calling step. The joint calling operation won't add much cost relative to DeepVariant (scaling benchmarks for GLnexus can be found in Figure 7C of [the DeepVariant-GLnexus paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/24/5582/6064144).

Energy Efficiency,"Hi Charles,. Thank you for the machine information. For the AWS instance, the 8-core machine has 8-fold fewer CPUs than the 64-cores used in the case study. Given this, the total number of core-hours is 144. This is actually quite efficient for a DeepVariant run. For more similar time to the case study, you could consider the m5.12xlarge or m5.24xlarge, with 48 and 96 cores respectively. The 96-core instance will likely be faster than the case study, though with worse economics. In all cases, the use of spot instances will be far more cost-favorable. For the GCP run posted, this looks to be the GCP cost-optimized execution framework. This framework is built by the Google Cloud, so although I cannot speak as directly to this, I can refer your question to the right place. That GitHub repository is here: https://github.com/googlegenomics/gcp-deepvariant-runner/issues. For your Docker question, I believe that this error reflects that you are not mounting the volumes in the proper way in your script. In your .sh script, you may want to try to more closely align the way your script mounts and creates input and output directories with the case study. I don't feel that I can clearly communicate the details of mounting the Docker volumes.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi DeepVariant team,. I'm running DeepVariant via Singularity via Snakemake on a HPC cluster and overall, if I create an interactive session, my entire WES pipeline runs fine until an odd DeepVariant job fails (by that I mean that let's say 30 deepvariant jobs finish ok and the 31st fails). I can then restart the Snakemake run and the same job will run fine, followed by more jobs that will also run fine until another odd jobs fails. This is also particularly true when I use the --cluster command in Snakemake (i.e., send it to a SLURM job scheduler from the master node) - in this event every single job fails. I could of course run all my samples on a single interactive session, keep checking the log file and restart the run every time it fails but I guess that's less than optimal plus this way I can really only run one sample at the time. For the interactive sessions I request 180G and 64cpus (in my case it's: ```srsh --mem=180G --cpus-per-task=64 --partition=long```). .

The disk space seems okay, though you have some memory-mapped file-systems, which should be okay if you have a good amount of memory. . Memory on Ubuntu can be checked with `cat /proc/meminfo` or (`top`). For example, when I ran the variant candidate selection, on just a small region of a chromosome and monitored memory usage, I saw the following trend:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/7e200851-3fde-4ad6-bf75-477ccefb9e32). You'll notice that it can be resource intensive. This is the reason I was opting we troubleshoot by first trying with a smaller region of a chromosome using `--regions`, ideally one you know variants should be present. A preliminary check with `samtools view -c BAM REGION` would ensure you have mapped reads there for DeepVariant to find, and with `samtools flagstat` to check on that subregion for the number of quality reads. .

Energy Efficiency,"Hi Mark (@depristo),. Sorry, I meant to put this together a while ago - regarding https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/27#issuecomment-364683474 - but got a bit swamped with a research deadline. In any case, this is purely for intellectual curiosity and discussion. Regarding the first point, where differences in allocated CPUs might be the cause for the timing, that could be remedied by specifying a minimal CPU requirement, as noted here:. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform. So to control for the variability in the test, the two options are either: a) to set the `--min-cpu-platform` setting to the maximum available (`""Intel Sandy Bridge""`), or b) to keep requesting and canceling instances until the desired one is allocated on which all tests should be performed, thus satisfying consistency. Just as a quick inspection, by looking at the CPU cycles utilization, I just ran a performance analysis of 0.4 and 0.5.1 on `make_examples` - since it displayed the initial discrepancy - and there seem to be some slight increases in `0.5.1`, which might cumulatively affect things.

Energy Efficiency,"Hi Sophie,. So it is best to train across all the samples. The reason is that the model will need to be representative of all those samples, and you don't want to overfit for one sample over another. Today there is more data than computing power and memory, so training happens by batching the data, training on a batch, and then tweaking the model in the follow-up batches. Here's a visual example of what could happen:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/3ff13990-c2cc-4863-a904-bb0219791b06). In the first batch, the coefficients will be biased in a monotonically increasing function. Then when the second batch is used to tweak the model's parameters, it will shift towards a monotonically decreasing function shifting it towards an opposite direction. Then when the third batch comes in it will shift the parameters in the other direction. Sure, the independent variable (x-axis) here is a simple one-dimensional type, but this can become complex with multiple channels (`read base`, `base quality`, `mapping quality`, etc). And of course if the training data is shuffled, then the validation data and tuning data should also be shuffled in order to have the same data representation - with the exception of the test data, which will be used for benchmarking the model as a real scenario (though there is additional read shuffling when downsampling with too many reads for a pileup image). As @akolesnikov mentioned, the `input_pattern_list` parameter of the shuffle script takes a list of files, so you can do it all at once. Let me know if I should expand on anything.

Another option I was considering that is easier to perform, however is much more computationally heavy, is to train a new model from scratch for each of the classes I wish to add, where I would modify the VCF file given to the 'make_examples' script to make the labels be : 0/0 = undefined, 0/1 = yes, 0/2 = no, and to do this for every new class I wish to add. So I would run the vanilla DeepVariant on my input BAM, then do further runs with each model to further categorize variants that would fall within each of the classes I am examining (can possibly even process the initial output VCF such that the additional runs will only run for within those regions that were initially classified as a variant). Is such an approach possible? If all that is being done is converting each input into 6 channels and have it run through the Inception Pipeline then I believe my approach should be possible. I guess my question specifically is, is there anything within the DeepVariant pipeline that will prevent me from training it to identify completely new classes instead of the default HOM-REF, HET, and HOM-ALT?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/67#issuecomment-383347052:276,charge,charge,276,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/67#issuecomment-383347052,1,['charge'],['charge']

In our [blog post](https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2018-12-05-improved-non-human-variant-calling-using-species-specific-deepvariant-models/) you mentioned, we showed an example of further training a model to perform better on mosquito data, which has higher variant density than human. Since then, internally we have continued to investigate what properties of the human genome and population structure DeepVariant learns during training. We’re hoping to come up with a suggested non-human model soon, but do not yet have a specific timeframe for releasing such a model. In terms of having a ""universal"" model, that is a good question too! We are currently investigating whether we can reduce the number of models we release while maintaining the high accuracy. Ideally if we can train one model that works well for all scenarios, we will certainly do that. Currently we’re optimizing our model accuracy for each common application, while keeping the number of released models as low as we can.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/204#issuecomment-518518311:728,reduce,reduce,728,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/204#issuecomment-518518311,1,['reduce'],['reduce']

Energy Efficiency,"Thanks @Asppagh . Sorry it took me a while to get back to this. From your response above, you're talking about the `call_variants` step.; The issue (https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/74) you cited above was from a while ago, so the numbers might have changed. But I think it's still a good reference point. Even with 8 cores, going from < 1sec to 20-60 sec does seem extreme. Let me try to get a 8-core, 64 GB machine and test it with Singularity and report back, so we can have a better comparison. Other thing that come into mind is that `call_variants` step uses TensorFlow, which relies on CPU optimization to be faster. See: https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2019-04-30-the-power-of-building-on-an-accelerating-platform-how-deepVariant-uses-intels-avx-512-optimizations/; Can you check what type of CPU you have? (What's in your ` /proc/cpuinfo`?). One more note on num_shards:; num_shards affects the way that `make_examples` step is parallelized. On the high level it shouldn't affect call_variants step. But, setting `num_shards` to 8 means the output from `make_examples` will be in 8 shards (8 files), so it's possible that the input into call_variants become slower, but I don't expect a big difference. And, I would expect setting `num_shards=1` would make `make_examples` step much slower.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/463#issuecomment-866205653:699,power,power-of-building-on-an-accelerating-platform-how-deepVariant-uses-intels-avx-,699,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/463#issuecomment-866205653,1,['power'],['power-of-building-on-an-accelerating-platform-how-deepVariant-uses-intels-avx-']

Using a greedy algorithm makes it inferior to WhatsHap. Although, experiments showed that final DeepVariant accuracy only slightly suffers. * Another big difference is that one-step phasing uses ""noisy"" proposed candidates when WhatsHap is run on genotyped variants produced by running DeepVariant on unphased data. The code which performs the phasing operation is in https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.4/deepvariant/direct_phasing.cc. . Please note that our the DeepVariant model in v1.4 is able to run on candidates phased by WhatsHap, and the model has similar performance. This can be done by adding flags to the step of make_examples if run separately. If it is of interest for you to run DeepVariant v1.4 using the WhatsHap flags instead of the direct phasing, we can provide you with instructions to do so.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/557#issuecomment-1228968407:109,reduce,reduce,109,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/557#issuecomment-1228968407,2,['reduce'],['reduce']
Energy Efficiency,"We have previously highlighted two examples where DeepVariant has been applied in non-human organisms:. * [Rice](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/analyzing-3024-rice-genomes-characterized-by-deepvariant) - are diploid and have similar variant density to humans with short-read data. The existing model worked well.; * [Mosquitos](https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2018-12-05-improved-non-human-variant-calling-using-species-specific-deepvariant-models/) - Used a retrained model to account for high variant density with short-read data. With mosquitos we found that our human-trained model had high numbers of false positive calls. This is likely because in humans increased variant density is often caused by mismapping of similar genomic regions, leading DeepVariant to not call what are likely artifactual variants (in humans). But in mosquitos, we variant density is much higher, so DV falsely discards what are real variants. Fortunately, zebrafish appear to have similar SNP densities with humans, and the fact you are using PacBio HiFi reads may also reduce variant-density issues. However, there are a number of factors that may contribute to poor performance: The specific strains being experimented with, regions of the genome being evaluated, differences in structural variation, coverage, etc. We would expect the DV human model to perform well in zebrafish, but it would be a good idea to estimate the error rate through a mendelian analysis, Sanger sequencing, or other methods to determine whether retraining is needed.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/415#issuecomment-771074189:1088,reduce,reduce,1088,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/415#issuecomment-771074189,1,['reduce'],['reduce']
Energy Efficiency,"ah good catch sorry I missed the image!. It has been a while since I have used slurm, but you could try:. ```; #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=28; #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1 # Or don't set this.; ```. See the explanation for `--ntasks-per-node`:. `--ntasks-per-node=<ntasks>`; > Request that ntasks be invoked on each node. If used with the --ntasks option, the --ntasks option will take precedence and the --ntasks-per-node will be treated as a maximum count of tasks per node. Meant to be used with the --nodes option. This is related to --cpus-per-task=ncpus, but does not require knowledge of the actual number of cpus on each node. In some cases, it is more convenient to be able to request that no more than a specific number of tasks be invoked on each node. Examples of this include submitting a hybrid MPI/OpenMP app where only one MPI ""task/rank"" should be assigned to each node while allowing the OpenMP portion to utilize all of the parallelism present in the node, or submitting a single setup/cleanup/monitoring job to each node of a pre-existing allocation as one step in a larger job script.

Imagine that instead of dividing by 10, I find the values (matrices) that best helps separate the data in a BAM file I know should have specific variants at specific loci. I want to maximize that precision to be able to recall. Now you notice that the original data and transformations (feature maps) are linked preserving this $`propagation`$ $`of`$ $`information`$, as this flow of information is enabled through these sets of transformations. An interesting thing then begins to emerge as you move up the layers of transformation. For example, early on in the neural network's set of transformations you will see patterns like this:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/bc3cff8b-efa8-4029-abbe-75ad06973d24). You might notice an explosion of features, with no specific patterns. These early steps are to generate a large variety of features to be able to have selection power for the later layers to use as input, for helping with the separation into distinct patterns for mapping to the different classes of genotypes confidently. For example, you can see distinct patterns forming as it reaches the later stages: . ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/9f69f9dc-8dec-4370-aa69-e0295265e7f0). ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/83edefd6-8d77-4a7a-8fb3-921ec7c3cff1).

Energy Efficiency,"iant runs faster on newer machines. However, your estimation of 24 hours on a 4-core machine is 96 total core-hours. This is not particularly slow for DeepVariant, in fact, it is fast. The DeepVariant WGS case study finishes in 242 core-hours, though it is probably possible to finish somewhat more efficiently on a smaller machine. However, if you are able to run GATK Best Practices in 96 CPU hours, this would be surprising based on external estimates, which place the total compute at 300-400 CPU-hours (e.g - https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/LY1OY9XJ). When you say you are using an identical command on Google Cloud, are you also using identical hardware?. 1b); With respect to cost, a large factor in the cost-efficiency of DeepVariant will be whether you are using pre-emptible instances on GCP, or spot instances on AWS. Can you clarify which type of instance you are using in these tests?. The 30x WGS case study, which runs for a wall-clock time of 4.5 hours on a 64-CPU standard instance class should consume 288 CPU-hours, which on a pre-emptible GCP machine should cost $0.01 per core-hour at current pricing, for $2.88. This is also not the most cost-efficient way to run DeepVariant. 2\); Your script runs `mkdir -p ${OUTPUT_DIR}`, which I believe does not work since you need sudo permission to create this directory. You will want to modify this command to ensure that `/home/cwarden/cdw-genome/Charles_Human/Genos_Exome/BWA-MEM_Alignment/Genos_BWA-MEM` exists locally prior to mounting. We also recommend updating your script to explicitly use the 0.8.0 image at ` gcr.io/deepvariant-docker/deepvariant:0.8.0`, which is now tagged as `latest`. Models are included in this image. The WES model checkpoint for this image is at `/opt/models/wes/model.ckpt`. To run the v0.8.0 container in interactive mode, you will need to modify the entrypoint as below. ```; docker run -it --entrypoint bash -v /home/user/cdw-genome:/mnt/cdw-genome gcr.io/deepvariant-docker/deepvariant:0.8.0; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/171#issuecomment-483448362:2172,efficient,efficient,2172,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/171#issuecomment-483448362,1,['efficient'],['efficient']

Energy Efficiency,"k we are in perfect agreement. Supporting what the community wants is my preferred approach as well. I was only suggesting it after having performed a reduction upon the functional set of DeepVariant's design. Just in case the community requires more variety of labeled inputs, having a parameter processor might help in mapping between DeepVariant's core operation and different parameter sets. This would create flexibility for both the goals of the design team and community. For example, the design team might want flexibility in playing around with different transformations of read signals and parameter search spaces - which might change over time or with different data sets - without worrying that the parameter list might require updating. Let's take the following simplified model optimization:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/f7c33960-59fc-45c9-9cdd-0f015ebd1aae). The team would let this model optimize itself to determine the parameter set under which it performs ideally. Then metadata about the training would be saved along with the optimized model. Then users can query the model's metadata via some program, which would provide information about the training data and parameters limits for different model types. Such metadata would be automatically populated through the model training step (where I'm including the validation and tuning steps). Based on that, a default set of parameters can be auto-generated for general users, and advanced users can then map their custom parameters however they want. It basically makes the training turn-key and usage automatic. Such training could even be remotely initiated through a browser, and different users can make some of their models available to others if they want, thus helping out the community and growing it at the same time. This would also make adapting new models much faster, including where a large set of specialized ensemble models might be required to check against.

This confirmed for me that I don't have AVX support. So it would be great for the examples that will drive usage and be used by many users to learn from, if the provided libraries are compiled with the bare-minimum of CPU qualities.

Energy Efficiency,"n by past progressions. As an analogy, given sequence of historical stock prices, can you predict the future stock price. Instead of stock price it produces variants. The ResNet is helpful to train faster as it is uses skip (shortcut) connection by utilizing the residual difference of input and output to learn from (residual learning). They use spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) for variable coverage of full-alignments. This still a convolutional neural network of weights and biases. It still operates like DeepVariant on channels constructed from your read information (`reference_base`, `alternative_base`, `mapping_quality`, `base_quality`, `strand_info`, `variant_type`, `insert_base`, `phasing_info`). What does this mean for you? We know your organism adapts significantly to the external environment. The deep learning models -- either DeepVariant or Clair3 -- have semi-fixed input assumptions. Sure they have been trained with some flexibility in the input data to capture some variability, but not to the extent that they will adapt to significant allele, or possible structural variation. I mean think of a convolutional neural network like this simplified example:. $`y\_output = weights_\gamma \cdot ( (weights_\alpha \cdot input + bias_\alpha) + (weights_\beta \cdot input + bias_\beta) ) + bias_\gamma`$. This is a simple regression (linear model). If you adjust the weights and bias terms for produce specific output given the input, and then you modify the inputs significantly and hope to get the same results, it will naturally fail. The same with DeepVariant and Clair3, they are bounded and determined by their weights and biases. These deep learning models were meant to work at scale under relatively normal data conditions (data conditions they were trained and validated for). The way to adjust for variable datasets is to create an ensemble model. What that means is that you have a model for each subtype of your organism. Then your run your data across all models to see wh",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/682#issuecomment-1650719832:1906,adapt,adapt,1906,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/682#issuecomment-1650719832,1,['adapt'],['adapt']

The only thing which is important is to add the changes as a single commit separately from other changes so it can be properly tracked in git history. > Can you help me understand the expected benefit of the changes? It looks like this should improve runtime for call_variants. Do you have any high-level information from benchmark runs for us to understand the percentage improvement to expect. You're right - this PR about efficiency of deep learning part only (call_variants). We need some time to collect some benchmark numbers and check what's is OK to share publicly. Probably, extra optimizations could be applied. > If we are to incorporate these changes, we would want to make sure this would perform well across various hardware. For example, we would want our Docker images to gracefully fallback to working code if it is on a machine with incompatible hardware. Do you expect OpenVINO to have this property (for example, if someone is running on an AMD machine). Proposed changes are very smooth - by default, OpenVINO is not used. We can test other Intel hardware such iGPU and HDDL-R. For non-Intel HW users can always use default implementation. > We will also have to think about how these changes interact with any updates we would make to our use of TensorFlow. We're not directly planning anything in the near future, but it's good for us to consider. I think it won't be an issue. It make sense to isolate some OpenVINO related logic to separate Python script to reduce conflicts during development. Additionally, I just wanted to ask if you're interested in using GitHub Actions so you can perform initial tests for pull requests. In example, https://github.com/dkurt/deepvariant/blob/master_openvino/.github/workflows/main.yml does Docker build and then runs WGS on getting-started data with TensorFlow and OpenVINO and compares the outputs ([logs](https://github.com/dkurt/deepvariant/runs/1259964899?check_suite_focus=true)).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/pull/363#issuecomment-709941019:2041,reduce,reduce,2041,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/pull/363#issuecomment-709941019,1,['reduce'],['reduce']

Energy Efficiency,"rsing the input data both forward and in reverse -- remembering internally long-term dependencies stored as states. This means it is fairly memory efficient and fairly fast. In terms of sequence it captures the variants given a progression known by past progressions. As an analogy, given sequence of historical stock prices, can you predict the future stock price. Instead of stock price it produces variants. The ResNet is helpful to train faster as it is uses skip (shortcut) connection by utilizing the residual difference of input and output to learn from (residual learning). They use spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) for variable coverage of full-alignments. This still a convolutional neural network of weights and biases. It still operates like DeepVariant on channels constructed from your read information (`reference_base`, `alternative_base`, `mapping_quality`, `base_quality`, `strand_info`, `variant_type`, `insert_base`, `phasing_info`). What does this mean for you? We know your organism adapts significantly to the external environment. The deep learning models -- either DeepVariant or Clair3 -- have semi-fixed input assumptions. Sure they have been trained with some flexibility in the input data to capture some variability, but not to the extent that they will adapt to significant allele, or possible structural variation. I mean think of a convolutional neural network like this simplified example:. $`y\_output = weights_\gamma \cdot ( (weights_\alpha \cdot input + bias_\alpha) + (weights_\beta \cdot input + bias_\beta) ) + bias_\gamma`$. This is a simple regression (linear model). If you adjust the weights and bias terms for produce specific output given the input, and then you modify the inputs significantly and hope to get the same results, it will naturally fail. The same with DeepVariant and Clair3, they are bounded and determined by their weights and biases. These deep learning models were meant to work at scale under relatively normal data conditions (data cond",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/682#issuecomment-1650719832:1627,adapt,adapts,1627,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/682#issuecomment-1650719832,1,['adapt'],['adapts']
Energy Efficiency,"s to use as input, for helping with the separation into distinct patterns for mapping to the different classes of genotypes confidently. For example, you can see distinct patterns forming as it reaches the later stages: . ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/9f69f9dc-8dec-4370-aa69-e0295265e7f0). ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/83edefd6-8d77-4a7a-8fb3-921ec7c3cff1). Once the pattern has been achieved like the following, then one can proceed with testing each genotype's representation of the variant:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/13e95fe0-71b1-40aa-bccc-4d8c5463de6f). We want to see for which genotype the set of patterns (the feature map above) maximizes for, which will indicate the genotype present with a specific maximal probability. First we test for $`homozygous`$ $`reference`$:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/be5e3074-4c2f-4600-9ea3-9cb6bfda58f8). Next we test for $`heterozygous`$:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/1e43b84e-17ae-40ea-8c82-b7e87d0cf3d6). Finally we test for $`homozygous`$ $`alternate`$:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/cedce40f-4fc0-45fe-843b-e2652b31c0af). Now we can see there is a significant correlation with a heterozygous variant call. So to call a variant site's genotype you now have the power to traverse the whole neural network -- through a set of transformations (you can tweak) to identify hidden patterns in the data -- as it is all linked from the start (read encoding) to finish (genotype identification). This ability is enabled through the preservation of the propagation of information (which is deeply and directly linked) in order to help one optimize upon. That's why you don't want to throw anything away, as @AndrewCarroll and @pichuan mentioned as it helps you inspect and tweak the selection power and criteria as it is all interconnected.

Energy Efficiency,"t cost-optimized configuration for running DeepVariant). We state this runtime as a baseline, and mention that many accelerated pipelines exist that allow WGS to run as fast as 40 minutes. I want to clarify the runtimes a bit more. Previously, our estimates for speed was based on the GCP cloud-orchestration framework developed external to our team. The speed-optimized one here is 70 min. However, as there are now multiple orchestration options (including Parabricks and ATGENOMIX) we have decided to separate the single-machine runtime from what can be achieved with orchestration. I understand you are running on your own local hardware, note that the speed will be a function of how new your CPU is, the AVX acceleration used by DeepVariant runs faster on newer machines. However, your estimation of 24 hours on a 4-core machine is 96 total core-hours. This is not particularly slow for DeepVariant, in fact, it is fast. The DeepVariant WGS case study finishes in 242 core-hours, though it is probably possible to finish somewhat more efficiently on a smaller machine. However, if you are able to run GATK Best Practices in 96 CPU hours, this would be surprising based on external estimates, which place the total compute at 300-400 CPU-hours (e.g - https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/LY1OY9XJ). When you say you are using an identical command on Google Cloud, are you also using identical hardware?. 1b); With respect to cost, a large factor in the cost-efficiency of DeepVariant will be whether you are using pre-emptible instances on GCP, or spot instances on AWS. Can you clarify which type of instance you are using in these tests?. The 30x WGS case study, which runs for a wall-clock time of 4.5 hours on a 64-CPU standard instance class should consume 288 CPU-hours, which on a pre-emptible GCP machine should cost $0.01 per core-hour at current pricing, for $2.88. This is also not the most cost-efficient way to run DeepVariant. 2\); Your script runs `mkdir -p ${OUTPUT_DIR}`, which I b",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/171#issuecomment-483448362:1304,efficient,efficiently,1304,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/171#issuecomment-483448362,1,['efficient'],['efficiently']

Energy Efficiency,"tart to have enough material to get long ONT precise reads (the very last one that is accurate at 99.99%, just like a giant PCR); those are much less likely to mismap, and Clair3 seems extremely powerful and precise to call. Therefore, we could consider the call from long reads as a ""truth set"". . My point is if I give deep variant the ONT ""truth set"" and then the mapping of short illumina reads. Could it be retrained to understand the mapping and calling issues with this kind of genome? I don't have a ""rule"" such as Mendelian violation because my organism is clonal. Therefore, the only possibility of having a ""truth set"" is to trust long reads mapping (Sanger sequencing doesn't work well either; we don't know why). . Is it something doable? I could use other things, such as Python random forests, as suggested by a colleague, but since you have spent a lot of time trying to help me, before, I found it gentlemanly to ask if we can use Deepvariant.; I think the answer is ""Yes, I could"". To be quick ... I have 25 datasets of high-coverage Illumina data. And I'm not sure I will get those datasets resequenced in long reads with enough coverage and N50 (for another reason we don't understand well, DNA extraction is harrowing in rotifers; it often fails or yields highly damaged DNA). Therefore, if I could retrain a model to use the Illumina datasets, that would be great. . My worries are: what does it take in terms of hardware to retrain Deepvariant? I don't have access to a huge GPU. . I found this tutorial: https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md . but I am not sure if it is adapted to my case, streamlined, or can be done here, if I understand well this example relies on using Google machines, right?.

Energy Efficiency,"this is everything that is in the vcf, so the deviations are not picked up at all. It is just one line with the 5' deviation. If I include other genomic region, than I do see more variations there, but for this region it is not recognized at all.; ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb092f42-5285-48f5-b2c8-dc1f9590e9c2).

I then aligned against only the transgen in the genomic context (~50 kb each side) and then the variants are called correctly, so it seemed to have something to do with the reads also mapping to the other region. So I checked the reads again in more detail and it turns out that at the 5' SNP only 2 reads are primary and at the two 3' SNPs there is only one primary alignment, the others are supplementary. Therefore vsc_min_count_snps=2 filters the 3' SNPs out, while the 5' barely passes. I then reduced vsc_min_count_snps to 1 and now I find also the two 3' SNPs in the vcf output, with one passing and the other being Refcall. Of course plenty of other SNPs show up as well, but with low QUAL values and being RefCall ... So this is an issue of the way that I make the reference FASTA, but I don't see any other way of doing this, because otherwise I would have to duplicate the surrounding genomic DNA postentially ending up with many supplementary alignments as well.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/892#issuecomment-2401535093:1268,reduce,reduced,1268,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/892#issuecomment-2401535093,1,['reduce'],['reduced']

Great to hear. There are minimum allele fractions that are used to generate candidate variants here (https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.5/deepvariant/make_examples.py#L165), you'll likely want to lower those thresholds for your use case. For the model itself, there is no explicit allele fraction, but keep in mind that the model was trained to predict the diploid genotype states of {hom ref, het, and hom var} so things that are lower allele fraction will likely be classified as 0/0 by the model.

Integrability," I start focusing on stuff not related to DeepVariant). Nevertheless, I have my bucket (cdw-genome) mounted in my home directory (/home/cwarden), because it didn't work if I tried to mount it in /mnt. So, that is why I didn't previously have the ""sudo"" commands, but I have added them and tried again. I also tested adding `gcsfuse --file-mode 777 --dir-mode 777` (but that was for a different reason, because I couldn't run executable files from my bucket, and it looks like that solved that particular problem). However, I did quickly test, and I could run ""touch test.txt"" without adding that extra parameter (or using sudo).

Integrability," dig deeper into the training behavior, can you check this:; What is the distribution of your labeled data? For example, in the regular DeepVariant formulation, we have 3 classes, ""0"" -- HOM_REF, ""1"" -- HET, ""2"" --HOM_ALT. HET and HOM_ALT are the ones that are consider germline variants, while HOM_REF calls will result in `RefCall` in the final DeepVariant VCF files.; To give you an example, in our [0.8 release](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.8/docs/deepvariant-details-training-data.md#deepvariant-training-data), our total number of examples for WGS was 346,505,686. And the distribution was:; ```; class 0, count: 101,679,899; class 1, count: 145,911,730; class 2, count: 98,914,057; ```; There is no fixed recommendation of what the ratio should be. It depends on a lot of factors such as what is your BAM file like, what is the threshold you're using in the first round of very sensitive caller (which picks the candidates that feed into the classifier), and many many other details that are specific to your data. Which is why I said our team cannot help debug the details of your case. But hopefully by examining your own distribution, you can first see if the training (and tuning) data makes sense or not. If the data has very skewed distribution, there are also other techniques that the ML community uses to improve the accuracy. But I won't be able to get into that. It's also not what DeepVariant designed for.; DeepVariant is wrapped around TensorFlow, which is a much more general purpose ML tool. If there are functionalities that we don't provide, please also look into TensorFlow to see if they have something useful for you. I'm closing this issue now because this is not really a DeepVariant issue. But if you believe this actually reveals some bugs in our codebase, I'm happy to discuss further if you can show a reproducible example that demonstrate the error.; Closing this issue now.

(Issue #878). Use caution with links and attachments. Hi @desmodus1984<https://github.com/desmodus1984> ,. Fundamentally, training a DeepVariant requires truth data (truth variants and confident regions).; The core question here is: Would you be able to get truth data for the bats you're studying?. I quickly looked through your recent discussion with @kishwarshafin<https://github.com/kishwarshafin> .; I believe @kishwarshafin<https://github.com/kishwarshafin> has been trying to give you some tips on some ways to construct truth. Note that this is an advanced topic. We don't expect most of our users to train DeepVariant models, or to construct truth data. However, if you do have truth data (truth variants and confident regions), you should be able to follow the documentation https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6.1/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md to try to train a model. From your description above, I still think the best way to proceed is to directly use DeepVariant release models. Once you have the callsets, try to evaluate the calls first. Even if you plan to train a model, it'll be good to have those baseline metrics available, so you know whether your trained model is working or not. Does this help?

Integrability," for your kind and prompt response. For _point 1_ (and part of _point 2_), thank you very much for that additional information. I think my question was a simpler one: you can see multiple submissions for some groups, and I was trying to see if I understood all the submissions that used DeepVariant. Since there is only one ""rpoplin"" label (and no other entries from Verily Life Sciences), I'll assume that is the only DeepVariant benchmarks (in contrast to the there being multiple groups using GATK, in pipelines that gave varying results). I am also assuming that no one else was using DeepVariant at that time. However, please correct me if I am wrong. For _point 2_, I apologize: it is bad form to critique something without having tested it yourself. I sometimes worry that frequent use of deep learning may represent something that is popular (where many applications may not remain in common use in the long-term), but I need to assess each situation individually. So, I am very sorry about my tone in my initial message. Because of this post, I am now using DeepVariant as a way to practice learning some new skills in my free-time (such as using cloud computing options), but that makes it harder for me to provide a timely response. While the practice is something that I would like to gain on my own (I believe that I will lose some intuition about the results if I don't run the analysis myself), you are certainly welcome to work with any of the underlying data that I have uploaded to my [PGP page](https://my.pgp-hms.org/profile/hu832966). For _point 3_, I apologize that I need to take more time to read other papers carefully before citing them. For example, I have pretty much always seen a drop in accuracy for indels versus SNPs. However, if filtering for regions expected to have good concordance, I the loss in indel accuracy wasn't as bad as you might expect from [Figure 4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0054-x/tables/4) in that paper (however, the concordance in",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/165#issuecomment-476428247:1052,message,message,1052,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/165#issuecomment-476428247,1,['message'],['message']

However, I then get that ""docker.sock"" error message if I try to run `docker ps -a` after the script stopped from that error message. So, that puts me back where I started, and I actually have that extra error message (over trying to use Docker from the instance launched via ECS). Nevertheless, if I make any additional progress, I will let you know. **Update (4/10/2019)**: FYI, if anybody else has a similar problem, I eventually remembered that I needed to add myself to the Docker group using `sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user`, exiting, and then starting a new ssh session (a similar command was useful when I wanted to use gcsfuse along with Docker on Google Cloud, which is what I am currently testing...).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/167#issuecomment-480642492:1976,message,message,1976,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/167#issuecomment-480642492,3,['message'],['message']

Integrability,"## When there isn't an error message at all:; Is it possible that it could be running out of memory? That could be why running on an individual region succeeds while it fails on the whole bed file. Out of memory issues are hard to catch because they don't result in error messages. I ran the exome case study myself just now and it worked fine. In terms of compute resources, our testing system goes as low as ""n1-standard-8"" on Google Cloud, which is 8 vCPUs and 30 GB of memory. If your setup is less than 30GB of memory that might be the cause of the issue. Reducing the number of shards to 1 might help, but if it doesn't, you might just need to use a machine with more resources. ## When faidx also fails; Check that the fasta looks okay and perhaps redo the `samtools faidx` that created the `.fai` in the first place just in case.

So, I download the whl from the [GCloud bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/deepvariant/packages/tensorflow/) and executed `sudo python2.7 pip install <name of .whl file>` through the terminal. It ran, just to tell me “.dist-info directory not found”. I think this might be due to some inconsistency in the packages installed through the build-prereq.sh script, because I can see that all the packages that it installed (e.g. numpy) are for Python 3.5, but the Tensorflow version it's trying to get is for cp27 (Python 2.7). Not sure about where to go from here, would love some assistance :). ### System details; OS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS; Python interpreters: Default with Ubuntu (2.7 and 3.5.2); Deep Variant version: Installed it today from the main repo, so probably r0.4.1.

Integrability,"(versus local server + storage) for processing 100s or 1000s of samples (or even more, although I assume that would probably be for more than most individual labs or citizen scientists). I think 24 hour run-time was similar to running GATK on my local computer (with 8 GB of RAM and 4 cores), so I’m not really complaining about the Cloud run-time that I encountered (I am just saying that the estimates provided on the README didn’t match my own experience, even with an almost identical command on Google Cloud). **1b)** I realize that it would take some time (and I’m not sure what would be the benefits versus other projects). However, have you considered allowing users to upload their run-time information (and estimated costs) to a program that might be able to help estimate run-time and cost (to possible help with topic **1a)**, **in the long-term**)?. Since `gcp_deepvariant_runner` avoids the possibility of delays between running steps (and has an exist status depending upon whether variant calling was successful), perhaps some sort of optional reporting to an anonymized database could be provided as a parameter for that?. **2)** While I realize it could be considered a cross-post, I am trying to test running each of the 3 steps run separately on Google Cloud (instead of using `gcloud alpha genomics pipelines`).

The issue is that `google.api_core.client_options` is not found when being imported from `googleapiclient.discovery`. The issue appears to be the [python3.3 _ _ init _ _.py trap](http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python_concepts/import_traps.html#the-init-py-trap) where one python module is blocking another from being found. In the python path there is a `google` module with an `__init__.py` found here, `/tmp/Bazel.runfiles_461ld2s6/runfiles/com_google_protobuf/python/google/__init__.py`, while running. That may be blocking the discovery of `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/google/api_core/client_options.py`. **Work Around**. I think configuring Bazel to avoid the issue is probably the right way to fix this, but I worked around the issue by patching `googleapiclient.discovery` with the following patch:. ```; 49c49,59; < impor",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/469:2819,depend,dependency,2819,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/469,1,['depend'],['dependency']

Integrability,"1. I haven't seen the `n_elements is zero` message before, but googling it, it looks like a memory allocation problem.; 2. No, 200GB should absolutely be enough for DeepVariant with any setting, including PacBio HiFi. I'm not sure what is going on here, but in case it helps unblock you for now, have you tried doing the haplotagging with whatshap? See the pacbio case study for exactly how we run this workflow: https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.2/docs/deepvariant-pacbio-model-case-study.md.; I would be curious if you are able to at least follow that case study on your compute setup and see whether that works.

Integrability,"1. No - this should not be necessary. This operation is handled by DeepVariant.; 2. There are two arguments being passed here: `--make_examples_extra_args=""split_skip_reads=true, channels=''`; - `--make_examples_extra_args=""split_skip_reads=true` - Turns on operation that splits reads. This is the equivalent of GATK SplitNCigarReads.; - `channels=''` - Disables additional channels from being added. Currently we add an insert_size channel by default, but the RNA-seq model does not currently use this channel.; 3. The RNAseq model can be applied in any region. However, if you look at our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.16.512451v1.full), you will see that we restrict much of our analysis to CDS regions. The reason for this is that variant calling in CDS regions is a desirable use case where we can maintain relatively high accuracy in RNA-seq data. However, you can use a larger set of regions depending on what the goals of your analysis are. You can also apply filtering to increase precision in these regions (at a cost of reduced sensitivity). See the section `Selecting a cut-off for practical implementation` in our preprint for details on this idea. <img width=""633"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1536935/234003967-3aa5abd4-f8f3-494d-8ada-79eef723548b.png"">.

On a side note, I got many Deepvariant failures with error messages like:; ```; Detected 1372 oom-kill event(s) in StepId=12049020.batch cgroup. Some of your processes may have been killed by the cgroup out-of-memory handler.; ```; This seems to have been resolved by asking for maximum allowable memory. I am still curious about the memory requirement for successfully running Deepvariant.",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/614:12769,message,message,12769,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/614,2,['message'],"['message', 'messages']"

You can read about the SAM/BAM format at the following link:. https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf. So to answer the last two questions. So having good coverage (read depth) lets you get around sequencing errors -- meaning you might have to repeat the experiment as well for ensuring consistency in the results. Some labs create error models with different known repeated read lengths to generate a sequencer error model -- you don't need to do that, as that cost a lot of money to do properly. You can probably do it with known samples and compare it to golden truth datasets, but again that will cost. The other way to do it is to try other assays to confirm your results. . Understanding all the moving parts takes time. Sure it is very rewarding once you have a complete understanding of a model, but it all depends on how much time is reasonable for you. You can always keep learning after getting the PhD, as that just teaches you how to independently think about big problems and how to systematically break them down (defending your approach). Once you confidently have that thought process down, you're virtually unbeatable and don't need hone that skill as it already is innate. You can always practice that during your postdoc :) .

Integrability,"> Hi @Axze-rgb,; > ; > Yes, you want to only look at your `./.` and `0/0` genotypes, because the subclonal variants will likely not look like true germline ones, and probably fall into the category of not being called or a reference call. Keep in mind the model was created with a specific type of variation in the dataset as it was minimizing the loss function to optimizes the model's weights, in order to have the variant caller's GQ values correlate maximally with the GQ scores derived empirically from GIAB ground truth. So your tensor images might not look like optimal ones that the model would recognize as a true germline variant, but that discrepancy might have significant statistical stability above the noise region, of which you can take advantage of.

Integrability,"> Hi @aderzelle; > ; > I have two recommendations: First, to tell whether the CNN made a RefCall classification, you can look for an output line in the VCF itself. DeepVariant will write a RefCall for every candidate considered. If a line is not present in the output VCF, it means that the reference and non-reference read counts instead generated the reference call because a candidate was not made at that position.; > ; > Second, I would recommend that you look at the visual report that @MariaNattestad created in the most recent DeepVariant release. There is a way to run this on previous VCF files, see: [This page](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.9/docs/deepvariant-vcf-stats-report.md); > ; > In that visualization, take a look at the VAF support for each call. The nearby variant phenomenon manifests as a higher number of REF calls with a VAF close to 1.0. In humans, this seems to be DeepVariant avoiding false calls in LINE elements and segmental duplications, but this could be undesirable depending on your reference genome and population structure. Hello, in my case, which is not humans, I find the following. First, the reads I used are the same used during the reference genome assembly process. Therefore, any new homozygous variant with a vaf of ~ 1 is either the reflect of assembly errors or mapping errors. I do find such variants. But I am more intrigued by the peak of Hom (x/x) at a vaf of ~ 0.5 . am I right to assume this is not typical and might reflect a problem? ; Interestingly for the reference calls, there also seems to be 2 peaks, one with a vaf around 0.2 which I guess is all right and one with a vaf around 0.5 which I guess also indicates a potential problem. ![genotypes_deepvariant](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23341393/72908229-7db81b00-3d35-11ea-99f9-e3dfa126a127.png).

In v1.2.0, we updated to Python3.8. When I tested this, I was trying to get Python3.8 to work on Ubuntu18.04, but didn't quite get it to work. Not saying it's impossible, but we think it was easiest to update the whole Dockerfile setup to run on Ubuntu20.04 rather than trying to get it to also work on 18.04. > ; > Would also like some clarification on this statement to help me figure out what is going on,; > ; > `Build clif binary from scratch. Might not be ideal because it installs a bunch of dependencies, but this works fine when we used this in a Dockerfile because we don't do build-prereq.sh in the final image.`. For the build-prereq.sh statement -- what it means is: As part of that script, it runs https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.2/tools/build_clif.sh which builds [CLIF](https://github.com/google/clif) from scratch. CLIF is required when you build DeepVariant code. The build_clif.sh script installs a bunch of stuff on your machine. If you directly run ./build-prereq.sh on your machine, you just need to be aware that those things are installed as a side effect. But, if you're using our Dockerfile and using docker build, we only carry over the built binaries to the next stage. So the extra things installed by CLIF wasn't carried over. Hopefully that's more clear?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/476#issuecomment-896293199:39,depend,dependencies,39,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/476#issuecomment-896293199,2,['depend'],['dependencies']
Integrability,"@A-Tsai So now you're getting into determining your lineage graph of computations, which requires a lot of thought on how you set up your data and computational steps. Wide dependencies (multiple child partitions from the parent RDD) should be kept on the same node, while narrow dependencies (one child partition per parent RDD) can go over the network. Spark does hash partitioning to shuffle, and tries by the modulo of the number of partitions that it is somewhat uniformly distributed. Basically you should model your computation tree in order to best organize the data for good distribution and maximal local computation, otherwise you flood you network which slows down your completion-time. If you have 8 compute node with 4 cores each, then the node number will not change. The key to think about is the cores, but you have to determine to resource-allocate properly. The following can be helpful:. http://site.clairvoyantsoft.com/understanding-resource-allocation-configurations-spark-application/. Regarding task information, you get the duration here:. https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskInfo@finishTime:Long. You can control the policy with the application as noted here:. https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/job-scheduling.html#scheduling-within-an-application. You can control the assignment by creating pools with a `minShare` of cpu cores guaranteed for that pool. If you have one pool, then that can control it all - especially in FIFO mode - but that would not be efficient use of a Spark cluster. Spark has many moving parts, including how you structure your data and how to chose to process it (batch vs. stream). To properly perform this you have to analyze carefully the design of your computational DAG, and how your work should be processed given the resources. To me 200 partitions does not quite feel right, but if you think that is optimal for your design that's fine. Hope it helps,; ~p",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/90#issuecomment-417185546:173,depend,dependencies,173,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/90#issuecomment-417185546,2,['depend'],['dependencies']

Integrability,"@AndrewCarroll Thanks for the thorough response. This was extremely helpful. Also re the haplotype caller comparison: I thought DeepVariant also uses a PairHMM to score haplotypes to re-align reads to, and then feeds that to the CNN. . From the paper:; > The likelihood function used to score haplotypes is a traditional pair HMM with fixed parameters that do not depend on base quality scores. This likelihood function assumes that each read is independent. Finally, each read is then realigned to its most likely haplotype using a Smith–Waterman-like algorithm with an additional affine gap penalty score for homopolymer indels. So both methods use PairHMM to score haplotypes, and assist in re-aligning reads, ya? After that, the similarity is nil between the methods as you mentioned. .

However, internal phasing does not permit the output of phased variants due to the operation being limited to 25,000 base regions at a time, with no synchronization between these regions. * From version 1.4 onwards, DeepVariant internally handles read phasing, eliminating the need for external phasing to attain the anticipated accuracy. * If desired, one may opt to run third-party phasing after executing DeepVariant.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/649#issuecomment-1551634414:536,synchroniz,synchronization,536,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/649#issuecomment-1551634414,1,['synchroniz'],['synchronization']

Integrability,"@ekofman Currently, the case studies (and corresponding scripts) are used to show an example of how to run DeepVariant. We showed an example of how to run it on a single machine, and didn't focus on many other aspects such as how to pull multiple workers to orchestrate a distributed workflow, or how to run with GPU (which involves installing GPU driver, using the binaries that are built for GPU, etc).; If you want to run on GPU, and if you have everything set up already (such as installing GPU driver correctly), you should be able to do it pretty much the same way.

Integrability,"@pichuan My goal is to use **long reads** of E.Coli in order to evaluate the variant calling from such type of reads.

Integrability,"@scott7z Well, my feeling is that would be too much work, which could be fostered elsewhere. Unless there is a defined criteria for working off a specific revision, it is usually less of a benefit to be tied to a specific release. It'll also make the cost of supporting it too much of a headache, as the other dependencies will continue to evolve. I always prefer to simplify and feel it's more practical to push compliance of dependencies to their maintainers, while expanding on the fun part of adding community-driven features. For example, there over 1000 commits between the two SHAs, and it would be hard to keep track of so many contributions:. ```Bash; $ git log | grep commit | cat -n | grep '97a4c226e8a9e7c5c36fc38e2b9f8459c77abd5a\|ab0fcaceda001825654424bf18e8a8e0f8d39df2'; 1 commit 97a4c226e8a9e7c5c36fc38e2b9f8459c77abd5a; 1244 commit ab0fcaceda001825654424bf18e8a8e0f8d39df2; $; ```.

Integrability,"@sophienguyen01 , . If you are looking for INDEL purity then `--select_variant_types='indels'` should work well I believe? You are losing some INDELs but ultimately you are creating a training set that contains only INDELs. You can also generate more training samples by downsampling the bam and re-running `make_examples`. On the other hand, if you think about inference pipeline, when you are in prediction mode, you can't switch your `--select_variant_types` to something else than your training data as the model will now have to deal with data it has never seen before. There can be two scenarios:. 1) You train a model with `--select_variant_types='indels'` and after the model is trained, you are running inference with `--select_variant_types='indels multi-allelics'`. Then the model will have to deal with mult-allelic variants it has never seen before so the prediction on those would expected to be poor. 2) You train a model with `--select_variant_types='indels multi-allelics'` and allow a few snps to be present in the training. In which case during your inference or prediction, the model will be confident on all indel cases. It depends on what exactly you are trying to do, but, my suggestion would be to use `--select_variant_types='indels multi-allelics'` for your purpose.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/813#issuecomment-2091275266:1145,depend,depends,1145,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/813#issuecomment-2091275266,1,['depend'],['depends']

However, there was slow-down after pulling the docker image (possibly due to the type of instance?).

Integrability,"Andrea;; Thanks for following up and for all the additional details. It's a bit strange, as all the file paths in your error messages look like it got installed under python 3.6 rather than 2.7. It's hard to tell if that's just coming from the conda machinery or indicative of a different problem. . You could try installing in a separate environment as a first pass to avoid any conflicts:; ```; conda create -y -n deepvariant python=2.7 -c bioconda -c conda-forge deepvariant 'google-cloud-sdk<243.0.0'; ```; If that still has the same issue, then we'd need to dig more into the `post-link.sh` errors you're seeing.

Integrability,"Another update on CLIF dependency:; @chapmanb , as you noticed, CLIF is an issue here. We pre-built our own CLIF and directly used it in the DeepVariant build. I also just realized that we didn't release the script that we used to build CLIF, which should totally be released. I was planning to push out a 0.6.1 today, but now it's late so I'm going to wait until Monday for my own sanity and not breaking things over the weekend. However, if it's helpful I'll paste the content here right now. Note that this is used to build for Ubuntu. I did start looking into whether we can modify it for CentOS 6, but stuck at how to get `protoc` and hasn't resumed my work yet. I'll just paste our script for Ubuntu and hopefully that could be helpful if you want to look into building a CentOS compatible CLIF. Next week I'll push a 0.6.1 that has this under the tools/ directory. And I'll also see if I can figure out how to build it for CentOS6. ```; # Builds OSS CLIF binary for DeepVariant.; #; # This script should be run on a cloud VM.

Integrability,"Hello Andrew,. I am having the same problem... I am trying to call SNPs in a species with a very high density of SNPs, and short read callers do not perform well, they miss a lot of variants in cohort samples, resulting in ridiculously high mutation rates, or the opposite they reject everything as mapping errors. I am now turning to long reads... I have the hope to obtain a solid golden reference set. That might be useful for training a DeepVariant model with short reads.

Integrability,"Heureka, I suppose - so this is the story:. I have previously installed a conda environment on the host system (has nothing to do with singularity or Deepvariant); and as part of that environment, I also installed ortools via pip (pip install ortools). One of the depencies is protobuf; which will not install the c++ version by default in this constellation (see: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/539). . The issue: The pip command installs the protobuf module in $HOME/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages and for some reason, Deepvariant INSIDE the container sees this and tries to use it (my guess). . Any idea of how to prevent this from happening? I think binding $HOME into the container is pretty standard Singularity (and Docker?) behavior, but these kinds of library clashes shouldn't happen - maybe the container could be set up to not see these host-system libraries when loading modules in python?.

I have two data sets of Illumina reads one was from a control group, the other from a treatment group. I think the number of reads is comparable.

Still alot of unused memory and disk. 1) Any idea how I might estimate the expected run time? . 2) Any idea of how I do a better job sizing compute resources?. 3) How do I know if docker is making progress or not?; I did a run a couple of weeks ago. I think it took a total of 66 CPU hrs. It seemed like after all the examples where constructed the docker did not produce log message for a long time. Eventually, the docker completed. The results were really good!. 4) I run on ubuntu and use nohub. I want to run time, my script, report 'data up' on completions. I always put nohub job in the background.

Integrability,"Hi @Axze-rgb,. This clearly tells me that your organism is highly sensitive under selective pressure. So let's think what might happen if you used Clair3. Clair3 has both a full-alignment network (ResNet), and a pileup network (Bi-LSTM). . Bi-LSTM is just a recurrent neural network that is memory efficient to remember past events without gradient instabilities, by going through the input forward and in reverse while getting output information from the previous step. All this means is that it has a bunch of weights and biases that the input (and previous output) progresses through in a time-series-like pattern -- traversing the input data both forward and in reverse -- remembering internally long-term dependencies stored as states. This means it is fairly memory efficient and fairly fast. In terms of sequence it captures the variants given a progression known by past progressions. As an analogy, given sequence of historical stock prices, can you predict the future stock price. Instead of stock price it produces variants. The ResNet is helpful to train faster as it is uses skip (shortcut) connection by utilizing the residual difference of input and output to learn from (residual learning). They use spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) for variable coverage of full-alignments. This still a convolutional neural network of weights and biases. It still operates like DeepVariant on channels constructed from your read information (`reference_base`, `alternative_base`, `mapping_quality`, `base_quality`, `strand_info`, `variant_type`, `insert_base`, `phasing_info`). What does this mean for you? We know your organism adapts significantly to the external environment. The deep learning models -- either DeepVariant or Clair3 -- have semi-fixed input assumptions. Sure they have been trained with some flexibility in the input data to capture some variability, but not to the extent that they will adapt to significant allele, or possible structural variation. I mean think of a convolutional ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/682#issuecomment-1650719832:710,depend,dependencies,710,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/682#issuecomment-1650719832,1,['depend'],['dependencies']
Integrability,"Hi @BowenKwan you can try modifying the `PILEUP_DEFAULT_WIDTH` contant in [this file](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.10/deepvariant/dv_constants.py#L41). I didn't try this myself, so some additional changes may be needed, but this is a good place to start. For local training, copying the data files locally and updating paths makes sense. Some other changes you will need are below. Does the machine you plan to use have a GPU?. * Run the `model_train` and `model_eval` binaries directly, rather than running via Docker. Examples on how to use binaries directly are in [this WES case study script](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.10/scripts/run_wes_case_study_binaries.sh). DeepVariant comes with scripts to build binaries on Ubuntu, with Ubuntu 16 recommended. Binaries can only be built for a UNIX-based OS. Depending on what system you are using, you will need to modify these scripts. If possible, I would suggest using Docker as that will have the simplest setup. * Currently, we use [DataflowRunner](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/dataflow/) to [shuffle the generated TFRecords](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.10/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md#shuffle-each-set-of-examples-and-generate-a-data-configuration-file-for-each).

Integrability,"Hi @DiableJambe, . We use libssw (https://github.com/mengyao/Complete-Striped-Smith-Waterman-Library) for our local alignment. This code directly uses emmintrin.h in ssw.c so there's no easy way to remove it for the powerpc architecture.

Integrability,"Hi @FarmOmics ,. The `--model_type=WES` is a shorthand specifically for the wrapper script ""run_deepvariant.py"". Specifically here; https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.4/scripts/run_deepvariant.py#L236-L239. In https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.4/docs/deepvariant-rnaseq-case-study.md , you'll see that the RNAseq run actually overwrites these arguments:; with:; ```; --make_examples_extra_args=""split_skip_reads=true,channels=''"" \; ```. which basically means: If you run `make_examples` on your own (without using the wrapper script ""run_deepvariant.py""), you'll want to provide `--split_skip_reads=true`, but not providing `channels`. And we also provided RNAseq model with:; ```; --customized_model=model/model.ckpt \; ```. So, https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.4/docs/deepvariant-rnaseq-case-study.md isn't actually using WES model at all. (In the future we'll think about how to make this less confusing.). In terms of preprocessing for RNAseq data, the important flag to add is `--split_skip_reads` to make_examples.

Integrability,"Hi @Fred-07,. Since the [Element AVITI System](https://www.elementbiosciences.com/blog/whole-exome-sequencing-101-cost-effective-dna-sequencing-to-understand-genetic-disease) seems to be dependent on external exome enrichment solutions, the answer would be it depends. Element seems to [prefer Roche for library preparation](https://www.elementbiosciences.com/news/elements-new-aviti-system-shows-seamless-compatibility-and-high-performance-with-kapa-library-preparation-kits-in-multiple-ngs-applications) - also used in the paper - and which has its [own enrichment solution](https://sequencing.roche.com/us/en/products/group/kapa-hyperexome.html). Now if the exome selection is optimal, and coverage passes the Fold-80 base penalty (i.e. how much more required sequencing is necessary for 80% of the target bases to achieve desired mean coverage among samples), then the WES model should work given some in-house validation - as the reads have a higher quality (as shown below), and have worked for WGS:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/daa31daa-7abe-46fa-8037-f6ed49112c6f).

Integrability,"Hi @GaianX39 . I wanted to add just a few things. . First, in our next release we're planning to improve the de novo detection aspects of DeepTrio, so if that's of interest to you, please stay tuned for this. . Using GIAB to validate performance is only something that you can do when sequencing the known samples (e.g. HG002-HG003-HG004). If you have those, then please follow the ""Running Hap.py"" steps at the end of most quick starts (e.g. [Hap.py section of WGS case study](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deeptrio-wgs-case-study.md#perform-analysis-with-happy-against-421-truth-set). To do this with a joint called VCF, we use BCFtools to subset the VCF to individual samples (e.g. `bcftools -s ${SAMPLE_ID}`). For runtime, we have benchmarks in the Figure 6 of the [DeepTrio paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.05.438434v1). Here, we see DeepTrio takes about 1.5x the time that running DeepVariant on all 3 samples does. The cost should be a similar multiple as this is run on the same hardware. What this translates to in cost depends on how you run it (local, which cloud provider and with which deals, etc...)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/704#issuecomment-1719944491:1074,depend,depends,1074,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/704#issuecomment-1719944491,1,['depend'],['depends']
Integrability,"Hi @JosephLalli . At the time we were putting together the vg-giraffe paper, we noticed that Indel errors would occur because the positioning of read indel events in the CIGAR string were not always left-normalized. ABRA both fixed that issue and also seems to give some additional advantage by standardizing the representation before running the candidate generation in DeepVariant. Subsequent to that finding, both ourselves and the vg team built methods which left-normalize Indel CIGAR events during processing. We found that this reduced almost all, but not quite all, of the Indel performance difference with ABRA processed reads. Because we have built the DeepVariant vg pipeline to include read normalization with the --normalize_reads=true tag, we don't routinely benchmark the two methods against each other. Our last head-to-head benchmark on ABRA on and off on 35x HG003 was no_ABRA Indel F1=0.9953, with ABRA Indel F1=0.9958. @pichuan Has made [this linked gist](https://gist.github.com/pichuan/eedab4cf2e06fa7ceb2fad0f9b3f8066) that we use for efficient, single machine processing of vg giraffe+DeepVariant. We opted not to include the use of ABRA realignment in that pipeline. With the benchmark numbers available here, I hope this is sufficient information for you to decide whether you would like to include it or not. We continue to look at improvements in the Indel realignment/reassembly process to see if we can further improve in some of the manners that ABRA helps.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/629#issuecomment-1503848466:763,rout,routinely,763,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/629#issuecomment-1503848466,1,['rout'],['routinely']

Integrability,"Hi @aderzelle . I have two recommendations: First, to tell whether the CNN made a RefCall classification, you can look for an output line in the VCF itself. DeepVariant will write a RefCall for every candidate considered. If a line is not present in the output VCF, it means that the reference and non-reference read counts instead generated the reference call because a candidate was not made at that position. Second, I would recommend that you look at the visual report that @MariaNattestad created in the most recent DeepVariant release. There is a way to run this on previous VCF files, see: [This page](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.9/docs/deepvariant-vcf-stats-report.md). In that visualization, take a look at the VAF support for each call. The nearby variant phenomenon manifests as a higher number of REF calls with a VAF close to 1.0. In humans, this seems to be DeepVariant avoiding false calls in LINE elements and segmental duplications, but this could be undesirable depending on your reference genome and population structure.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/257#issuecomment-569131100:998,depend,depending,998,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/257#issuecomment-569131100,1,['depend'],['depending']

In the older v1.0.0, we asked users to set two flags `sort_by_haplotypes` and `parse_sam_aux_fields`:; https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.0/docs/deepvariant-pacbio-model-case-study.md#run-deepvariant-on-haplotagged-chromosome-20-alignments. We simplified in the current v1.1.0 by creating one new flag `use_hp_information`: so you only need to set `--use_hp_information` if your BAM has HP tags. You no longer need to set `sort_by_haplotypes` and `parse_sam_aux_fields` separately, and in fact, please just use `use_hp_information` instead of setting the other flags directly to avoid confusion, because you're using v1.1.0. To summarize, for v1.1.0, please set `--use_hp_information=true` if your BAM has HP tags. If your BAM doesn't have HP tags, set `--use_hp_information=false` (or don't specify it - false is the default). Thanks for reporting this.

Integrability,"Hi @crazysummerW . The message here is most consistent with reads that do not have quality values. Inspection of the GIAB file indicates that this is the case here - the reads have bases and not quality values. These GIAB files appear to be deposited in 2018. It seems likely to me that they are PacBio continuous long read (CLR) sequencing instead of Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS). PacBio CLR sequencing has a higher base error rate and DeepVariant is not designed to process this older type of sequence data. . Mechanically, the reason this input file fails is that it lacks quality values, which DeepVariant expects. CLR sequencing does not generate quality values.

Integrability,"Hi @dbrami ,. Thanks for the question. To make sure you can restart from each of the steps, you're on the right track : using `--dry_run=true` to find out what to run is useful. The other part that's missing is: when you want to rerun the next steps (say `call_variants`, after `make_examples` are done), you'll want to be able to access the outputs of the previous step. If you're using the one step `run_deepvariant` or `run_deeptrio` wrapper, the way you can do it is to make sure you specify `--intermediate_results_dir` and point it to your own output directory that you can access later. (The default is temp directory in /tmp, which would be inside Docker and might not be accessible if the run dies). And actually, if you use `--dry_run=true` just for the sake of finding out the commands, and then run each of the steps manually (still through docker), that actually gives you the best control, because you can see where all the intermediate files go. As your point about using a sentinel file after each of the steps finishing - I totally understand the point, and agree that such solution can make resuming the run easier. I can file an internal issue to track this suggestion. However, the feature for resuming runs might not be able to prioritized soon based on our workload.

Integrability,"Hi @dbrami . With respect to the python version, this software is contained within Docker, so you don't need to worry about what version is on your system. They python versions that we can use are a function of the requirements in the dependencies of DeepVariant. In this case, we need to use Python 3.8 as a result of those dependencies. You are right that updating to Python 3.11 might have speed advantages, but this is something we will have to look at over time as underlying libraries are updated. . With respect to GLnexus, we are expecting that there may be further updates to GLnexus, and will look at updates to that when those might become available.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/755#issuecomment-1865191737:235,depend,dependencies,235,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/755#issuecomment-1865191737,2,['depend'],['dependencies']
Integrability,"Hi @duceppemo , can you clarify what error message you were seeing when you try with a BAM file with `.csi` indices?. I just tested with data from https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.2/docs/deepvariant-quick-start.md. And I deliberately deleted the `.bai` index file and created a `.csi` instead:. ```; $ rm -f quickstart-testdata/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam.bai; $ samtools index -c quickstart-testdata/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam; $ ls quickstart-testdata/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam*; quickstart-testdata/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam; quickstart-testdata/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam.csi; ```. After that, it seems like I was still able to go through the Quick Start steps without any issues. DeepVariant is using htslib to read BAM files, and it seems like `.csi` is already supported there.

Integrability,"Hi @elcortegano . Thank you for the file, it's very informative, and I have a few observations that might help. First, all of the reads in this file which have sequence bases do have the correct number of quality values. The reads are not malformatted. However, there are reads with the SAM flag 256, secondary alignment. This occurs when the mapper finds a place which is almost or as good to map the reads to. Not all mappers report secondary alignments, and this is often controlled by a parameter. These reads have neither sequence bases, nor quality values, but do have a CIGAR string. I believe (but am not certain) that DeepVariant is attempting to parse these reads, and this is causing the error. I was not able to confirm, since I wasn't able to find the reference genome used to map. These reads can be validly ignored by DeepVariant. If this is the case, there are a few options to proceed. First, I believe that if you perform the command: . ```; samtools view -bh -F 256 file.bam > new_file.bam; ```. The file should now work with DeepVariant. . One thing it might be good to consider, based on my inspection of the CIGAR strings, I think these are likely HiFi reads. The program tag for minimap indicates the parameter -ax map-pb. I think that parameter is optimized for CLR. I believe the parameter for CCS/HiFi is -ax asm20. We usually take mapped BAM files from pbmm2, which wraps minimap2 with parameters optimized for HiFi. This could be why we didn't notice this exact issue before. If this is the source of your problem, our team can fix this behavior in future releases by ignoring flag 256 reads. You may want to consider mapping with pbmm2 as well (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbmm2). If this does not fix your issue, could you please point me to the reference genome which you used to map to, I would need to try running DeepVariant and walk through the error more closely.

Integrability,"Hi @gneedle1 . It depends on the type of experiment. If the barcodes are the same sample and you are trying to get at some other specific property (e.g. cell type or preparation), then it's a question of sequencing coverage. If you will have enough coverage to make good quality calls within the reads of a single barcode (something like at least 15x-20x depending on your tolerance for errors), then subsetting by barcode could be reasonable. If you have less coverage, then the effects of reducing coverage will likely be much larger than whatever effect you are trying to detect. .

Integrability,"Hi @jumpyknight . Which GIAB sample are you using and which version of the truth set?

Which corrected a number of errors in the prior truth set. If you are using v3.3.2 for this sample, it would be interesting to know if those have been corrected. To you question about the type of variants that occur. Yes, it is known that repeat expansion and contraction is more likely to occur, and these tend to add to the full repeat content. So it is not unexpected to see changes in repeat number. . To your question about whether this may have caused DeepVariant to be more prone to call reference, I think the proportion of errors in Genome in a Bottle is quite small. DeepVariant is very accurate, so these may be a reasonable fraction of the total apparent errors, but they are not a large fraction of the total training sites.

Integrability,"Hi @kokyriakidis ; MKL is an important part of the speed improvement for the `call_variants` step in the v0.7 release.; We don't currently have tried on AMD, so I can't say what the performance will be like. I'd like to learn more if you try it and have some numbers to share. . In general it's pretty difficult for the DeepVariant team to give advice on hardware or fine-tuning for a specific configuration. I usually think of that as an open-ended research problem itself, because many factors could come into play. I think @pgrosu 's advice above is the best. Start documenting numbers with your current configuration, continue with various hypotheses (""can I use less RAM?"", ""am I building with the optimized flags for my setting?"", etc) and trying them out.

Integrability,"Hi @kokyriakidis. Thank you for your question. There are a few possibilities for this. First, chrX and chrY do share regions of homology, the pseudo autosomal regions (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2435358/), which allows them to pair and segregate appropriately during meiosis. Because the reference sequence for both chrX and chrY contains these sequences, even in a female individual, reads will map to either and this can manifest as HET calls. It could be good to look at whether these calls occur in PAR regions. This will depend on which reference you are using, as some references mask this region. Can you tell us the reference build that you are using?. Second, reads may end up mismapped onto chrY from autosomes. When mismapping occurs, there is signal that will look like variation. The variant callers are not told whether a sample is male or female, and have to judge whether the signal is consistent with a variant or if the sample is female. Errors in this process can occur. How many variants are you seeing as PASS, it could be illustrative to compare this number to other benchmark human samples.

Integrability,"Hi @mdriller . My answer to your question will depend on what exactly you will need from Plink and what sort of cohort approach you have. . If you just want to be able to run Plink on the joint genotype results, I wonder if you can try following the process which was performed for UKBiobank to convert their DeepVariant exome joint calls into PLINK format. That is the section **Conversion of pVCF to PLINK and BGEN files** [from the UKBiobank WES Protocol](https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/ukb/docs/UKB_WES_Protocol.pdf). I hope this will work, as it is not generally our preference to replicate the functionality of -ERC BP_RESOLUTION, and this is likely to make writing output much slower. If, instead, you want calls at specific sites (similar to a genotyping chip approach but with NGS data), I would say that is is possible to force genotyping at a given set of alleles with one of the modules of DeepVariant (VCF candidate importer). I suspect this isn't what you want though.

Integrability,"Hi @njbernstein . Performance on STR will be a function of the size of the event. In Illumina data, DeepVariant will likely stop calling events as they start to reach 100bp in size and larger. DeepVariant will call STR events below this size (for example, here is a HET call repeat expansion in one allele and repeat contraction in the other from a DeepVariant HG002 WGS VCF):. 10	50527727	.	CTATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATA	C,CTATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATA	37.1	PASS	.	GT:GQ:DP:AD:VAF:PL	1/2:17:56:2,22,29:0.392857,0.517857:37,20,52,20,0,40. I don't have stratified accuracy metrics for STR performance, nor do I have comparisons of this to dedicated STR tools. I would imagine that dedicated STR callers perform better for the long (100bp+) events, due to specific approaches for that class of problem, below 100bp, I do not have an intuition as to which approach will perform better. For complex variants, do the extent these are in a size range callable by DeepVariant, DeepVariant will represent the sequence-resolved candidates found for variation. Here is an example from a DeepVariant HG002 WGS VCF):. 1 67310873 . CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGAAAAATTAAA C,CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGAAAAATTAAA 45.4 PASS . GT:GQ:DP:AD:VAF:PL 1/2:18:36:2,26,6:0.722222,0.166667:28,4,35,4,0,2. The second ALT allele has insertions of A at multiple places, so that this doesn't cleanly fit into a single contiguous set of inserted or deleted bases. In practice, these complex events will be rare in the size range that DeepVariant is designed to address as a small variant caller. Accidentally (because we did not design or train DeepVariant to do so), DeepVariant will call much larger insertion events in PacBio CCS data. Finally, with respect to your haplotype-aware question. Conceptually the first two steps are quite similar. For the first step, identifying which regions to reassemble, DeepVariant employs a relatively simple model which identifies regions that will benefit from reassembly.

Integrability,"Hi @obsh, I am still not sure what is causing the failure. I noticed that you are using an older release (v0.6.1), so I would suggest switching to the latest v0.8.0 release. I'm not sure that this will address the failures, but I would recommend it regardless since we have updated the code and models. . As a sanity check, you could try running the command above with different data. [This page](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/docs/tutorials/deepvariant#calling_exome_regions_configuration) contains an example using Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) data. If the problem is fixed, perhaps there is something unexpected about your data, and we can further investigate. We also recommend that you try directly running DeepVariant through the Docker image, which may provide additional error messages that are helpful for debugging. You can refer to [this document](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.8/docs/deepvariant-quick-start.md) for an example. Please let us know if you run into the issue through this setup. One thing to note: our models have been trained using human data, and may not necessarily generalize well across species. We have trained a model for mosquito data, and while doing so, we noticed that retraining using data from this species significantly improved performance (more details in [this post](https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2018-12-05-improved-non-human-variant-calling-using-species-specific-deepvariant-models/)).

In the Blog (Improved non-human variant calling using species-specific DeepVariant models), in a trio, one offspring was used for establishing the ""silver dataset"", and five other progenies were used for training and evaluating. So the individuals used for generating the truth dataset and training are different.; However, in the deepvariant documents, it seems that the truth dataset, training and evaluating examples all come from HG001, the same individual. Does the individual used for generating truth dataset and training have to be different? If not, could you please explain why di d you use different individuals in the first case?. 2.

Integrability,"Hi @sivianil . That is interesting. I don't think that this error message has something to do with the allele being multiallelic. We generate multiallelic outputs for human samples and hap.py works for those. . If you want to filter to only bi-allelic calls, you can post-process the VCF with bcftools . `bcftools view -m2 -M2`. From reading the error, it seems that the most likely explanation is that the reference genome used in the hap.py evaluation does not exactly match the sequence of the reference genome used to map the reads in the BAM file used in DeepVariant.

Integrability,"Hi @zxy1555847 . @MariaNattestad is correct that there are only a small number of errors, so it is hard to definitively tell you what is going on. . However, one thing I want to point out is that in general for exome sequencing, we expect for all analysis methods, accuracy will start dropping outside of the capture ranges with an increasing amount the farther we go from the capture. We also expect Indel to be affected more than SNP. . The reasons for this is that sequence coverage begins to drop toward the boundaries of the capture (the amount of this drop depends on the particular capture and the sequence context around it, but on average it will be the case). In general, lower coverage will mean lower accuracy, but we observe that coverage has a larger effect on Indels than SNPs (this is detailed in our [Extensive sequence dataset](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.11.422022v1) paper. The reasons that are complex (though if you want me to further elaborate, I can try). .

Integrability,"Hi Maria! Thanks for your fast reply,; so the Bam I'm using is acutually generated a bit differently than usual (at least it's not actual HiFi ccs reads).. I performed LAA from pb software (v8) on targeted (one gene) HiFi amplicon data. LAA performs ccs and demultiplexing, and from that it immediately creates consensus 'clustered/phased' sequences (as the target is only one gene, the fastq consists of only one or two consensus seqs, depending on the found alleles). I have mapped those against our reference gene using minimap2 and this results in the Bam I'm using as input here. . This particular Bam contains only one read. My worry is that DeepVariant will not like the fact that there is only one read, but I believe this issue would be similar when performing lowcov sequencing. Maybe the model I'm using 'PACBIO' is considering actual PacBio HiFi ccs reads? Anyways, I didn't get to that conclusion because it didn't find the record at all.

In any case, this is purely for intellectual curiosity and discussion. Regarding the first point, where differences in allocated CPUs might be the cause for the timing, that could be remedied by specifying a minimal CPU requirement, as noted here:. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform. So to control for the variability in the test, the two options are either: a) to set the `--min-cpu-platform` setting to the maximum available (`""Intel Sandy Bridge""`), or b) to keep requesting and canceling instances until the desired one is allocated on which all tests should be performed, thus satisfying consistency. Just as a quick inspection, by looking at the CPU cycles utilization, I just ran a performance analysis of 0.4 and 0.5.1 on `make_examples` - since it displayed the initial discrepancy - and there seem to be some slight increases in `0.5.1`, which might cumulatively affect things.

Integrability,"Hi Pi-Chuan,. I'm still not back home yet (so, I apologize that I'm not 100% answering your question). However, I can say this:. Even thought I would expect the direct command-line analysis (in AWS or Google Cloud) should cost less, I did briefly look into DNAnexus and Seven Bridges. However, DNAnexus requires that you create an account with an institutional e-mail, and I was checking about what were options for people who want to re-analyze that that is directly provided to them (who may not be scientists). I also didn't see a way to create a Seven Bridges account with a G-mail address, but both companies gave me an initial reply about my account creation question within 24 hours. That said, I am also currently working on uploading my data to PrecisionFDA (which uses DNAnexus, but I can't use my PrecisionFDA account to sign into DNAnexus). For the user, I think this would be free, and it provides a way to test results provided by companies (**and** I could create an account with a Gmail address). However, PrecisionFDA doesn't currently have a DeepVariant App. I passed along an earlier version of this thread to them, but I will also now ask if it might be helpful that DNAnexus already has a DeepVariant app (to see how easily that can be applied within PrecisionFDA). I'll upload the call_variants file when I get home. Unless there is something obvious that you can see, I think it would probably be more fair for your time to start a Google Cloud test (although that means you may have to wait a little while before I get to the same step on another platform).

Integrability,"Hi Pichuan,. It's a team effort :) Time is on our side as it's still sub-1.0. I think you can make it much easier and fun for yourself, as there another level to NGS analysis that can be tapped here. Currently the code sort of a wrapper to TensorFlow, and much of the definition of the input feature-set changed to the [0,254]-ranged 7 `ImageRow` channels -- `[base, base_quality, ..., matches_ref, op_len]` -- which is not really a RGB image anymore, and then run through the model to emit the three classes of predicted GT probabilities (homozygous reference, heterozygous and homozygous alternative):. ```; genotype_probabilities: 0.9999428988; genotype_probabilities: 1.8287e-05; genotype_probabilities: 3.88142e-05; ```. The VCF saving is helpful, but the interesting part is abstracting out the data and functionals (i.e. models), to enable a larger analysis platform, rather than still be file-focused which (dynamic) datasets would allow. Maybe tomorrow you want to try [Inception-v4](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/inception_v4.py) or some other more expressive network topology, which might require changes to your input tensor. I suspect things will become more of an ensemble model approach in the future, where you you want to push your data through multiple pipelines for comparison. At that point you're not even writing code anymore, but rather directing transformation among (ephemeral) datasets through an intermediate analysis language ([DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)) to try out different ideas upon a collection of data -- where some might contain/become golden standards. For example, now you have collections of transformed datasets streamlined as protobuf message, which can be filter-inspected as JSON as necessary for validation purposes, which you can do now such as for `CallVariantsOutput` among others:. ```; variant {; reference_bases: ""A""; alternate_bases: ""C""; calls {; info {; key: ""AD""; ...; call_s",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/21#issuecomment-353849339:229,wrap,wrapper,229,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/21#issuecomment-353849339,1,['wrap'],['wrapper']

Integrability,"Hi Sophie,. Regarding requirements for resources, it all depends on how large your data is that you need to process. Also only the middle step `call_variants` can utilize 1 GPU if you prefer, but you can run the CPU version of DeepVariant. Below are the two Docker versions:. [google/deepvariant:1.5.0 (CPU Version)](https://hub.docker.com/layers/google/deepvariant/1.5.0/images/sha256-6a27bc877db9191c8fad0fe5f98dce6192fd4eb6392551e1a3add8d01e08af2e?context=explore).

Regarding machines, people have had luck with [r4.8xlarge EC2 (32 cores and 244 GB of RAM)](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/167#issuecomment-479738587), especially since the different steps of DeepVariant [utilize different amounts of resources](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-details.md). So FASTQ files are used to align to a genome reference sequence such as [GRCh38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000001405.26/) to generate BAM files. The recommended on is `GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.gz`, which you can download from the following location:. https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/001/405/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38/seqs_for_alignment_pipelines.ucsc_ids/. Regarding aligning your FASTQ file, that depends on your type of sequencer. If you are using PacBio HiFi it is recommended you use [pbmm2](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbmm2), otherwise you can use [bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa).

Integrability,"Hi all;; Thanks for all the help getting an initial conda package in place for DeepVariant (#9) through bioconda. I wanted to follow up with some suggestions that would help make the pre-built binaries more portable as part of this process, in order of helpfulness for portability:. - Currently the binaries need a recent kernel with GLIBC > 2.23 due to pre-built htslib and other libraries. Would it be possible to build the DeepVariant libraries on an older machine to allow a wider range of system support? We build on CentOS 6 in conda to provide wider compatibility.; - main.py in the zip files hardcodes python to use `/usr/bin/python`. Would it be possible to generalize this by using the python that the zip file gets called with (`sys.executable`)? I currently patch this in the conda build: https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/0a2d467d63d011015efeef4b644e985297b6b271/recipes/deepvariant/build.sh#L22; - This is currently built against numpy 1.13 and ideally we'd want to sync with CONDA_NPY (1.12: https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/0a2d467d63d011015efeef4b644e985297b6b271/scripts/env_matrix.yml#L9). I believe building against 1.12 would make it forward compatible. An alternative to points 1 and 3 is making it easier to build DeepVariant as part of the conda build process. The major blocker here is the `clif` dependency which is difficult to build and the pre-built binaries require unpacking into `/usr`. If we could make this relocatable and easier to install globally we could build with portable binaries and adjustable numpy as part of the bioconda preparation process.

The message you included looks to be from Nextflow, not from DeepVariant, so we need more context to help you debug this.; 3. Can you try running this with a small region, e.g. `--regions chr20:100,000-110,000` in the `run_deepvariant` command? This should make it faster to debug so you don't need to wait multiple hours.

Integrability,"Hi,. Thanks for providing all of that information, it is very helpful. The issue does actually lie in pyclif and protobuf. We use an older version of protobuf that is stable with pyclif; updating it will break the interoperability between C++ and Python (the source of that seg fault). Our tests in `build_and_test.sh` do not appear to catch this, of which I have made a note to update in the future. . Is there a reason you cannot use our Docker builds from `1.6.1`?

Integrability,"Hi,; I have a question about the information used by DeepVariant (v0.9.0) with the model `PACBIO`: does this model rely on/benefit from the additional quality information contained in ""PacBio-native"" BAM files? In other words, are the variant calls identical for a dataset that is processed (i) using the PacBio-native BAM as input, requiring the alignment to be done with pbmm2 to keep said information intact; and (ii), using FASTQ as input (w/o the additional quality information), and the alignment is performed with minimap2 (since pbmm2 is essentially just a wrapper around minimap2, let's assume the resulting alignments are identical)?

Integrability,"It depends on what you want. In the simplest case, people take the genome (fasta) + callset (vcf) as a representation of this individual's genome sequence. This is a bit simplistic, though, as it doesn't differentiate between regions where we are confidently the sample is the same as the reference vs. those where we are uncertain. That information is captured in the ""genome VCF"" or ""gVCF"" which DeepVariant can generate (see `--gvcf` in `make_examples`) but currently isn't so usable as the records come out in TFRecord of Variant proto format. We are working on adding support for creating a normally-formatted gVCF by extending postprocess_variants to merge those gVCF records and the callset together, which we hope to release soon. But in the meantime the best representation you can get from DeepVariant (without coding up merging logic for the gVCF yourself, which you are more than welcome to do) is VCF + genome. . I can't comment on the suitability of FastaAlternateReferenceMaker for your specific needs (despite being the original author of that tool) as I don't believe it was widely used or whether it is maintained now. I would post to biostars or other equivalent forum to ask for recommendations on what people typically do to combine a genome FASTA + VCF to make a diploid (or haploid) reference genome sequence.

Integrability,"Pi-Chuan;; Awesome, thanks so much for the WORKSPACE path tip. That was perfect and exactly solved the clif issue. Nice one. The issue I'm running into now is that the build setup assumes that the libraries and include files are available in standard locations (`/usr`, I'm guessing) and within conda these will be inside the conda environment. So as soon as I compile htslib we get errors about now finding zlib.h, which is present in `$PREFIX/include` instead of `/usr/include`. I've tried hacking this include directory into the htslib copts:; ```; sed -i.bak ""s|\""-Wno-error\"",|\""-Wno-error\"", \""-I${PREFIX}/include\"",|"" third_party/htslib.BUILD; ```; but bazel is too smart and won't let us continue with non-bazel defined references:; ```; (00:28:31) ERROR: /home/conda/.cache/bazel/_bazel_conda/b3bf6b0de2935c6a10ef1e7d7b61873f/external/htslib/BUILD.bazel:209:1: in cc_library rule @htslib//:htslib: The include path '/opt/conda/conda-bld/deepvariant_1525566343740/_b_env_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_p/include' references a path outside of the execution root.; ```; So at this point I'm stuck by my lack of knowledge of how to incorporate this into the bazel build instructions. I couldn't find any conda bazel builds that already do this as a template and am not familiar enough with it to build up on my own. Would it be possible to make the dependencies you're installing with apt as explicit bazel targets like clif? If so, then I could adjust paths to the conda `$PREFIX` rather than `/usr`. What do you think about that approach? Other bazel tips/tricks would be very welcome.

Integrability,"Pi-Chuan;; Thanks for checking around to see if we can get a bazel expert involved. I think that would be the best way forward, as I'm just hacking around and don't have a strong understanding of how best to attack this. It's a general issue where the dependencies are present in a non-system directory and how to inject that into a build. I'm trying to build this inside of bioconda.

Integrability,"Pi-Chuan;; Thanks for following up with the additional work on this. For the pyclif requirement, it sounds like you're hitting the same problem as me: I'm not sure where to put it so that bazel can find it. Do you understand what locations it looks in and if we can tweak them? I'm not able to put it into `/usr/local` like you did, since we're confined to our work directory. Can I stick it in an arbitrary location and let bazel know?. For tensorflow, it seems like that was built on system with a more recent glibc than on CentOS6. It is a pain to have the full dependency try be compatible with older glibc. This is part of what makes conda nice, is that you're guaranteed to have this (well, as long as the dependency exists). It looks from that thread you linked that the conda package for tensorflow is all good on CentOS6 if installing from there for your build is doable.

For bazel, we'd gotten that updated and building on conda with CentOS 6 so are good to go with that dependency, it's really just CLIF that we're struggling with for building. For clif, this is great progress, thank you. I resuscitated my bioconda build script and gave it a try with this. It's making better progress but unfortunately needs to reconstitute the system wide python install within the build environment which we can't do in conda. Everything there is in an isolated work directory so won't have the system shared libraries it wants:; ```; $ /opt/conda/conda-bld/deepvariant_1525283132666/work/deepvariant-0.6.1/usr/local/clif/bin/python; /opt/conda/conda-bld/deepvariant_1525283132666/work/deepvariant-0.6.1/usr/local/clif/bin/python: error while loading shared libraries: libpython2.7.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory; ```; and the python libraries included symlink to the system wide ones you built against:; ```; lrwxrwxrwx 1 conda conda 56 May 2 17:54 _weakrefset.py -> /opt/rh/python27/root/usr/lib64/python2.7/_weakrefset.py; ```; I'm not sure if it's possible to make this more relocatable with any python as part of the build process.

Integrability,"Pichuan, to increase the ease use and expand adoption within the Bioinformatics community it might not hurt to have a collection of customized build-and-test environments at Google that match a variety of environment configurations that users have in place, or that common packages recommend out here. Sometimes folks will be curious to try out some new Bioinformatics software package, and the faster they get it to a running state on their own machines, the happier the experience enabling the community for that package to grow faster. Basically most people just want to use stuff - and want a turn-key solution - though some of us like tinkering with puzzles :) If their experience is good on something local - or even a cluster - then they'll see the obvious need to try it out on a Cloud environment. I sort of did it from the other side. Many times when I tested most of the GoogleGenomics tools, I would try them out in some real-world scenarios, I usually ran them against a variety of configurations. That helped with having better error messages, control flow decisions, documentation or additional features.

Integrability,"Thank you again for your reply, especially on the weekend. While I'd like to have a way to run all of the steps, thank you for this feedback. As a sort of similar test, I had a m3.large instance open, so I tested running the command from my home directory. For some reason, I don't get the same error message when I do this, but I also don't get any output and no output files are created. Nevertheless, this did gives me some ideas of other things that I can try. In general, maybe there are a couple things that I need to explain:. **1)** I am using an EC2 instance launched from ECS: https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/. This means Docker is already installed. When I create an instance through ECS, I don't think I have the option to create a micro instance (but that isn't my biggest problem). I thought I created the instance with an extra 100 GB of storage (just in case something extra was needed on the local hard drive, beyond RAM). But I don't think this should be the issue for this last step. There may be some other issue that I am not understanding, but I could run the 1st two steps this way (although with an admittedly longer run-time than I expected), and **postprocess_variants** is what I can't get to work. I also received a reply about converting the regular docker image to an[ ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) image (submitted on 4/2), to run in AWS [Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/). If that ends up being helpful, I will let you know. If they at least resolve that issue, the next ticket that I submitted (on 4/4) was for this exact issue (but I haven't heard any feedback from that yet). **2)** I want to be able to have my files (.bam, .fastq, etc.) accessible between instances. While I think Google created a way to do with with S3 buckets, my understanding was that I was supposed to do this with an EFS file system: https://aws.amazon.com/efs/. So, _/mnt/efs-genome_ is the EFS file system that contains my .fastq and .bam files (and DeepVariant output).

I'm a bit confused as to why it doesn't get unzip as a requirement since it's listed in the host dependencies in the conda recipe (https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/master/recipes/deepvariant/meta.yaml#L28). On the next iteration of the recipe we could add it to the `run` requirements to try and avoid this.

Integrability,"Thanks for the reply. I have analyzed some mismatches and here are some thoughts:. Looking at two mismatches, here is the first one:. Chr1:261478C>A :; - GATK (GT:GQ:DP:AD) = 0/1:99:43:31,12; - Deepvariant(GT:AD:DP:GQ:PL:VAF) = 0/0:33,13:46:25:0,24,38:0.282609. GAKT have a minimum BaseQuality of 10 and MQ of 20, deepvariant 10 and 10. . Calculating the probability of AD distribution 31,12 (GATK) and 33,13 (deepvariant) is approximately 0.24% for deepvariant and 0,26% for GATK – so the probability that this distribution occurs assuming diploid and 50% chance of success the GT is most likely 0/0. GATKs GT is 0/1 with a GQ of 99 – it is however flagged a VQSRTrancheSNP99.90to100.00, but this is dependent on the other genomes in the sample( Im not a big fan of VQSR). Manually inspecting the variant using IGV I would annotate this as 0/1, but it is reasonable that it is assigned 0/0 considering the errors introduced by Illumnia sequencing are not random, even though with an error rate of 1:1000 it is highly unlikely that the same error occurs at the same site 13 times. (btw this is PCR-free WGS). The variant chr1:202192T>C:; - GATK (GT:GQ:DP:AD) = 0/1:99:16:10,6; - Deepvariant(GT:AD:DP:GQ:PL:VAF) = 0/0:17,16:23:6:0,5,29:0.26087. The probability is here for deepvariant 1.75% and GATK 22.6% - so the discrepancy of this variant makes sense. Manually inspecting the variant using IGV I would annotate this as 0/1. I guess that by including low quality MQ in this case decreases the GQ for deepvariant and increasing the min_mapping_quality to 20 could be worth trying for comparison. Is there an argument that can be used for this? (im using GCP for this project). I have noticed that deepvariant call variants in soft-clipped regions, but is seems they are assigned 0/0 – this is great – is this an intentional feature in deepvariant algorithm? This could be one reason to the discrepancies as GATK by default also call in soft-clipped regions. I will try to excluded these regions from ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/135#issuecomment-451075737:701,depend,dependent,701,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/135#issuecomment-451075737,1,['depend'],['dependent']

Integrability,"Thanks for your comments @gunjanbaid . I think, since everything else works well on single node systems, having the shuffle script work well on single node systems is also desirable. It is good to be able to shuffle only smaller files like you said. But if we limit ourselves to the original tfrecord outputs, that comes with the limitation that the shuffles are localized and not global as in the current script. However, a way to shuffle globally can be constructed from this idea with an additional step. This additional step will simply partition the input data into random buckets. Then we shuffle each bucket. I believe this is equivalent to a global shuffle with uniform probability for each permutation. This would be something like:; ```; input_data = readers | ""FlattenInputs"" >> beam.Flatten(); partitions = input_data | ""PartitionInputs"" >> beam.Partition(<random_partition_function_name>, <num_partitions>); for i, p in enumerate(partitions):; writing = p | ""WritePartition%d"" % i >> beam.io.WriteTFRecord(...); ```. Then each partition may be shuffled individually using the shuffle script. I have rolled both partitioning and shuffling into the same [script](https://github.com/anands-repo/deepvariant/blob/r1.0/tools/shuffle_tfrecords_beam_for_local.py). I will report back regarding whether this works as expected. This depends on beam.Partition behaving properly.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/pull/365#issuecomment-720871901:1337,depend,depends,1337,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/pull/365#issuecomment-720871901,1,['depend'],['depends']

Integrability,"We have a CL going into our internal systems at Google, which we will cherry-pick in r0.4 or wait until the upcoming r0.5 release, depending on timing. Here's the text, though:. `make_examples` requires its input files to satisfy a few basic requirements to; be processed correctly. First, the reference genome FASTA, passed in using the `--ref` flag, must be; indexed and can either be uncompressed or compressed with bgzip. Second, the BAM file provided to `--reads` should be aligned to a ""compatible""; version of the genome reference provided as the `--ref`. By compatible here we; mean the BAM and FASTA share at least a reasonable set of common contigs, as; DeepVariant will only process contigs shared by both the BAM and reference. As; an example, suppose you have a BAM file mapped to b37 + decoy FASTA and you; provide just the vanilla b37 fasta to `make_examples`. DeepVariant will only; process variants on the shared contigs, effectively excluding the hs37d5 contig; present in the BAM but not in the reference. The BAM file must be also sorted and indexed. It must exist on disk, so you; cannot pipe it into DeepVariant. We currently recommend that the BAM be; duplicate marked, but it's unclear if this is even necessary. Finally, it's not; necessary to recalibrate the base qualities or do any form of indel realignment. Third, if you are providing `--regions` or other similar arguments these should; refer to contigs present in the reference genome. These arguments accept; space-separated lists, so all of the follow examples are valid arguments for; `--regions` or similar arguments:. * `--regions chr20` => only process all of chromosome 20; * `--regions chr20:10,000,000-11,000,000` => only process 10-11mb of chr20; * `--regions ""chr20 chr21""` => only process chromosomes 20 and 21.

Integrability,"Yes, if you use `run_deepvariant` (which is a wrapper for the 3 separate steps), the `*_extra_args` flags are just a more flexible way to allow you specify flags for each step. ; In `run_deepvariant`, we hard-coded some of the commonly used flags but not all of them. For example, you can't directly specify `--ws_use_window_selector_model` to `run_deepvariant`.; We thought people might eventually have use cases for all other less known flags. (Which is why the `*_extra_args` flags exist, but haven't been advertised or documented other than just the flag description. `make_examples_extra_args` description can be found here:; https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/97cd861800ccb43d750f392b518e99d514adddd8/scripts/run_deepvariant.py#L92-L96. Regarding the downside of turning off `ws_use_window_selector_model` in make_examples -- yes, it'll be slower. It's a small model where we used to decide whether we need to realign a window or not. When we set it to default, we found that it significantly decreased runtime, with negligible trade-offs. .

Integrability,"`unspecified_caller` is an invalid option. I've never actually specified it, but I think the behavior should be that it should crash earlier (hopefully with a meaningful error message). . To train your own sequencing-type specific model, generally if the sequencer's base error rate is not too high, the default `very_sensitive_caller` should just work. But, if it's tricker cases like ONT reads, having a separate candidate generation process which is smarter about proposing candidates, and then using `vcf_candidate_importer` is the right way to go. @maryawood Can you say a bit more about why the default `vcf_candidate_importer` doesn't work for you?

Integrability,"abstracting out the data and functionals (i.e. models), to enable a larger analysis platform, rather than still be file-focused which (dynamic) datasets would allow. Maybe tomorrow you want to try [Inception-v4](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/inception_v4.py) or some other more expressive network topology, which might require changes to your input tensor. I suspect things will become more of an ensemble model approach in the future, where you you want to push your data through multiple pipelines for comparison. At that point you're not even writing code anymore, but rather directing transformation among (ephemeral) datasets through an intermediate analysis language ([DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)) to try out different ideas upon a collection of data -- where some might contain/become golden standards. For example, now you have collections of transformed datasets streamlined as protobuf message, which can be filter-inspected as JSON as necessary for validation purposes, which you can do now such as for `CallVariantsOutput` among others:. ```; variant {; reference_bases: ""A""; alternate_bases: ""C""; calls {; info {; key: ""AD""; ...; call_set_name: ""Sample_Diag-excap51-HG002-EEogPU""; }; end: 1115835; reference_name: ""1""; start: 1115834; ...; ```. So what I'm humbly proposing is something more subtle and flexible. Imagine you open a genome browser, and search for a specific disease. It then can have you drill down to the available samples or the variation graph. For the variation graph it will allow you to see a model of transitions among samples relating the temporal behavior of subtypes of cancer. All these steps are multiple pipelines that are auto-triggered to run accordingly, or would be pre-cached results. As new samples come in, it improves the disease models, or other functional analysis.

CAUTION: This email originated from outside the organization. DO NOT click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe. Hi again,; I didn't read carefully so I missed that you said you want to train a model.; If you want to get make_examples to create more candidates, the other flags you need to consider are: vsc_min_count_snps, vsc_min_count_indels, vsc_min_fraction_snps, vsc_min_fraction_indels. With the default values of these flags for VSC (Very Sensitive Caller), you simply won't be able to even get candidates generated for low allele fraction variants. So I would suggest playing around with those flags and see if more candidates come out. Thanks!

Integrability,"ant the full data anyway (that wouldn't really be a small thing I can try). I understand if you can't even subsample from that.; How about at least posting the commands you used?. From earlier discussions, it sounds like the main thing you're changing about the data representation is the pileup_image_height. You can actually do the same thing on the QuickStart or CaseStudy data too. It will just look like a taller image with the bottom being mostly empty.; (You can use logic like this https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.6/docs/visualizing_examples.ipynb to visualize them). And then, I suspect there's a high probability that you can get the same error on the CaseStudy data if you follow the same steps. Once you're able to do that, post every steps (similar to QuickStart and CaseStudy) here.

Integrability,"call any negatives at all. But it's just my guess based on what you observe. (2) Before we even dig deeper into the training behavior, can you check this:; What is the distribution of your labeled data? For example, in the regular DeepVariant formulation, we have 3 classes, ""0"" -- HOM_REF, ""1"" -- HET, ""2"" --HOM_ALT. HET and HOM_ALT are the ones that are consider germline variants, while HOM_REF calls will result in `RefCall` in the final DeepVariant VCF files.; To give you an example, in our [0.8 release](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.8/docs/deepvariant-details-training-data.md#deepvariant-training-data), our total number of examples for WGS was 346,505,686. And the distribution was:; ```; class 0, count: 101,679,899; class 1, count: 145,911,730; class 2, count: 98,914,057; ```; There is no fixed recommendation of what the ratio should be. It depends on a lot of factors such as what is your BAM file like, what is the threshold you're using in the first round of very sensitive caller (which picks the candidates that feed into the classifier), and many many other details that are specific to your data. Which is why I said our team cannot help debug the details of your case. But hopefully by examining your own distribution, you can first see if the training (and tuning) data makes sense or not. If the data has very skewed distribution, there are also other techniques that the ML community uses to improve the accuracy. But I won't be able to get into that. It's also not what DeepVariant designed for.; DeepVariant is wrapped around TensorFlow, which is a much more general purpose ML tool. If there are functionalities that we don't provide, please also look into TensorFlow to see if they have something useful for you. I'm closing this issue now because this is not really a DeepVariant issue. But if you believe this actually reveals some bugs in our codebase, I'm happy to discuss further if you can show a reproducible example that demonstrate the error.; Cl",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/203#issuecomment-518462111:1833,depend,depends,1833,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/203#issuecomment-518462111,1,['depend'],['depends']

I have some notes on this [Stack Overflow post]( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55624506/running-docker-on-google-cloud-instance-with-data-in-gcsfuse-mounted-bucket) about the details of my installation and running of Docker on Google Cloud.

Integrability,"d as well. > ; > I'm trying to understand if additional channels are mutually exclusive choices for the 7th channel when using the `run_deepvariant` command. My first attempt at running with both `insert_size` + `allele_frequency` seemed to work. However, it produced examples with channels `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 19]` instead of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 19]`. I would have expected an error, yet `call_variants` produced a vcf output despite not having an `insert_size` channel. Did `allele_frequency` replace the 7th channel correctly? Or did it somehow encode `allele_frequency` data as `insert_size,` if that makes sense?. If you made examples with 8 channels, but the model has 7 channels, the call_variants step should have errors like you've shared in your original post:. ```; ValueError: The number of channels in examples and checkpoint should match, but the checkpoint has 7 channels while the examples have 8.; ```. If you make examples with 7 channels, but your model.ckpt has different 7 channels - then it depends. Starting from v1.4.0, we keep a `model.ckpt.example_info.json` file together with the model. For example:; ```; $ gsutil cat gs://deepvariant/models/DeepVariant/1.4.0/DeepVariant-inception_v3-1.4.0+data-wgs_standard/model.ckpt.example_info.json; {""version"": ""1.4.0"", ""shape"": [100, 221, 7], ""channels"": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 19]} ; ```. If the customized_model you're using has this file, and if the examples you're making ends up having 7 channels but different ones, then it should still give you an error. But, if you're using an older model (such as the AF model you're using), and if it didn't have a `model.ckpt.example_info.json` file with it, then I believe the current behavior is that it will try to use the 7 channels directly. Which will cause the issue that it might use the weights for allele_frequency channel for the insert_size channel. Does that make sense?. By the way, in case you haven't seen it, we have a nice blog post that talks about channels: https://",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/568#issuecomment-1251857213:1810,depend,depends,1810,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/568#issuecomment-1251857213,1,['depend'],['depends']

This is admittedly for an alternative Exome alignment (to test the code), but I also have an alternative WGS alignment to test. Also, I changed to name on the file on GitHub (but the content is currently the same). Part of that error message is repeated (for each shard), but I only copied one representative example above, for the repeated part. If I try to run the DeepVariant container in interactive mode (to try and understand what is going on), I get the following message (which is a note, without actually going into interactive mode):; ```; docker run -it -v /home/user/cdw-genome:/mnt/cdw-genome gcr.io/deepvariant-docker/deepvariant; See https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.8/docs/deepvariant-quick-start.md.; ```; I do have the `gcloud alpha genomics pipelines` example working, so this isn’t absolutely essential for running DeepVariant on Google Cloud. However, if you can help provide me some guidance for running the [linked script]( https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Genos_Exome/run_DeepVariant_3steps.sh) on Google Cloud, I would very much appreciate it.

Integrability,"e more of an ensemble model approach in the future, where you you want to push your data through multiple pipelines for comparison. At that point you're not even writing code anymore, but rather directing transformation among (ephemeral) datasets through an intermediate analysis language ([DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)) to try out different ideas upon a collection of data -- where some might contain/become golden standards. For example, now you have collections of transformed datasets streamlined as protobuf message, which can be filter-inspected as JSON as necessary for validation purposes, which you can do now such as for `CallVariantsOutput` among others:. ```; variant {; reference_bases: ""A""; alternate_bases: ""C""; calls {; info {; key: ""AD""; ...; call_set_name: ""Sample_Diag-excap51-HG002-EEogPU""; }; end: 1115835; reference_name: ""1""; start: 1115834; ...; ```. So what I'm humbly proposing is something more subtle and flexible. Imagine you open a genome browser, and search for a specific disease. It then can have you drill down to the available samples or the variation graph. For the variation graph it will allow you to see a model of transitions among samples relating the temporal behavior of subtypes of cancer. All these steps are multiple pipelines that are auto-triggered to run accordingly, or would be pre-cached results. As new samples come in, it improves the disease models, or other functional analysis. This opens doors to Personlized Medicine -- clinicians, research, or patients -- enabling integrated analysis that is centralized for different types of datasets. You already have the protobuf data-structures for initiating that, thus allowing your stored collection of pipelines to drive that integration and comparison to take place, of which DeepVariant would be one of many. Thus flexibility in the form of modularity when refactoring the codebase will allow for more fluid hierarchical analysis to take place down the line.

Integrability,"et me try to unpack them. -- There are some engineering constraints in DeepVariant that assume we train only 3 classes. One example is https://github.com/google/deepvariant/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=DEFAULT_NUM_CLASSES&type= but there may be others. If you want to change the number of classes you'll need to track these down and generalize them. If you do that please send us a CL and we'll make sure to incorporate the changes into the master codebase here. Once you do that it should be possible to train as with as many labels as you like. -- You'll need to write your own labeler algorithm to provide a label for each training variant. These classes are in deepvariant/labeler. There are two (a PositionalLabeler and a HaplotypeLabeler) so you can use these as templates to hook up your own labeling algorithm. At the core these just need to return an integer label (0 ... N) for each example. Once you get that going it should be simple to label your own examples. Technically the labels can be anything. For example, if you emitted the reference base value as 0 for A, 1 for T, etc I'm pretty sure the machinery can learn to call the reference base from the image with perfect accuracy. -- The machinery of training really doesn't know anything about NGS data. It just takes the examples and tries to learn to predict the label. Once you get your labels in and the machinery doesn't expect just 3 it should be possible to train anything you want. You can use standard evaluation machinery to decide if your DeepVariant training run is successfully learning something. -- You'll likely need to write your own version of postprocess_variants (or extend it in some way) to bridge from the predicted labels and the information you want to export in the VCF (or other file format). In germline DeepVariant we learn to predict 0, 1, and 2 which mean hom-ref, het, and hom-alt, respectively, which is encoded in postprocess_variants. You'll need your own equivalent to this code.

Integrability,"le Cloud account now). **2)** I wonder if there is an issue with how I have the bucket mounted and/or I am running Docker (although that is probably beyond the scope of this post, and I'll close the issue if I start focusing on stuff not related to DeepVariant). Nevertheless, I have my bucket (cdw-genome) mounted in my home directory (/home/cwarden), because it didn't work if I tried to mount it in /mnt. So, that is why I didn't previously have the ""sudo"" commands, but I have added them and tried again. I also tested adding `gcsfuse --file-mode 777 --dir-mode 777` (but that was for a different reason, because I couldn't run executable files from my bucket, and it looks like that solved that particular problem). However, I did quickly test, and I could run ""touch test.txt"" without adding that extra parameter (or using sudo). However, I am unfortunately still getting an error message:. ```; sh deepvariant_run_Exome_BWA_MEM_by-step.sh; Reading package lists... Done; Building dependency tree; Reading state information...

Integrability,"lieve the ""winner"" designations from the precisionFDA challenge can be a bit misleading (even though, to be fair, they do color similar high percentiles, even though they also award a designation to one group per category). If I was the winner of a precisionFDA challenge, I would probably want to mention that somewhere. However, I don't typically see sections like ""Why DeepVariant"" at the top of most program READMEs. So, along with some observations about [run-time and cost](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/171#issuecomment-483903505), I think it may respectfully be worth considering trimming back some of that information (**while continuing to provide excellent support on the issues section of GitHub!**). **7)** My understanding is that there is not a DeepVariant App on precisionFDA. I think they use AWS, and I may be able to create something unofficial using code similar to [my AWS test](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Genos_Exome/run_DeepVariant_3steps.sh) (relating to issues #166 and #167). However, perhaps at some point, you could consider offering something that can be more officially (and better) supported by DeepVariant developers? This would be free to the users (since the FDA is covering the costs of using the DNAnexus-based interface), but there are some unique differences (like I had to change the chromosome formatting for my .vcf files, and there was an issue with my [Veritas WGS header](https://www.biostars.org/p/361415/#366669) that I had to fix). I am currently uploading my .fastq files (the .bam alignments are up there and public, but I think the chr format may cause issue with variant calling comparisons). However, all relevant information for these two samples will be publicly available in precisionFDA (from my [charles.warden](https://precision.fda.gov/users/charles.warden) account). You don’t have to re-open the ticket, but I would certainly welcome any feedback / thoughts that you might have.

Integrability,"me chromosomes? Then finally, once everything is shuffled, run model_train and model_eval. Let me reply to this part first:; ""First step is to run deepvariant make_examples in training mode to create training and validation sets. In the documents, these are individual chromosomes, but in theory these could be whole individuals or multiple individuals, is that correct?"" --> Yes that's correct. ""If for example, I used Chromosome 1 for my training set and Chromosome 2 for my validation set, should those repeated runs be made on different chromosomes, or the same chromosomes?""; If you want Chromosome 1 for your training set, and Chromosome 2 for your validation set, you'll run make_examples twice. One run to generate the training set with chr1, the other run to generate validation set as chr2.; Note that in both runs, you'll run make_examples with the `--mode training` flag. This can be be a bit confusing, but `--mode training` in make_examples just means that we will create examples with truth labels.; And you will need truth labels for your training set and validation set, . > ; > Thank you very much for your time, and if these questions are answered clearly in a doc already, then I apologize and would appreciate being directed there.; > ; > Best, Haley; > . I'll separately look at the dependency issue. I'll plan to repeat what is documented in https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6.1/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md on a clean machine and see if the dependencies still work. Sometimes when we documented it, things worked, but later on some underlying dependencies might have shifted. This is actually why we packaged our variant calling in Docker to make sure the versions are more consistent. But we haven't done so for our shuffling code in the training tutorial. Anyway, let me plan to walk through https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.6.1/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md myself and see if it still works.

Since `gcp_deepvariant_runner` avoids the possibility of delays between running steps (and has an exist status depending upon whether variant calling was successful), perhaps some sort of optional reporting to an anonymized database could be provided as a parameter for that?. **2)** While I realize it could be considered a cross-post, I am trying to test running each of the 3 steps run separately on Google Cloud (instead of using `gcloud alpha genomics pipelines`). I have some notes on this [Stack Overflow post]( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55624506/running-docker-on-google-cloud-instance-with-data-in-gcsfuse-mounted-bucket) about the details of my installation and running of Docker on Google Cloud. I suspect there may be some more complications that I need to learn about (in terms of running Docker on Google Cloud, *using data stored in a Google Cloud Bucket*), but the messages that I get are different when using the DeepVariant container versus my own container. So, I thought it might be OK to post a question here. If I try to run [a script]( https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Genos_Exome/run_DeepVariant_3steps.sh) on Google Cloud that is similar to AWS (and based upon the very helpful [DeepVariant Exome Case Study]( https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.8/docs/deepvariant-exome-case-study.md)), I get the following error message:. ```; $ sh deepvariant_run_Exome_BWA_MEM_by-step.sh; Reading package lists...

Integrability,"o see what the storage cost is now (although it should be higher now than before, because I have started to do other stuff with my Google Cloud account now). **2)** I wonder if there is an issue with how I have the bucket mounted and/or I am running Docker (although that is probably beyond the scope of this post, and I'll close the issue if I start focusing on stuff not related to DeepVariant). Nevertheless, I have my bucket (cdw-genome) mounted in my home directory (/home/cwarden), because it didn't work if I tried to mount it in /mnt. So, that is why I didn't previously have the ""sudo"" commands, but I have added them and tried again. I also tested adding `gcsfuse --file-mode 777 --dir-mode 777` (but that was for a different reason, because I couldn't run executable files from my bucket, and it looks like that solved that particular problem). However, I did quickly test, and I could run ""touch test.txt"" without adding that extra parameter (or using sudo). However, I am unfortunately still getting an error message:. ```; sh deepvariant_run_Exome_BWA_MEM_by-step.sh; Reading package lists... Done; Building dependency tree; Reading state information...

Integrability,"ophie,. Regarding requirements for resources, it all depends on how large your data is that you need to process. Also only the middle step `call_variants` can utilize 1 GPU if you prefer, but you can run the CPU version of DeepVariant. Below are the two Docker versions:. [google/deepvariant:1.5.0 (CPU Version)](https://hub.docker.com/layers/google/deepvariant/1.5.0/images/sha256-6a27bc877db9191c8fad0fe5f98dce6192fd4eb6392551e1a3add8d01e08af2e?context=explore). [google/deepvariant:1.5.0-gpu (GPU Version)](https://hub.docker.com/layers/google/deepvariant/1.5.0-gpu/images/sha256-312af65c01d27e4fc8bb34a4c933ca708bd24d2e7d8ac3076c9c7c078afa20e9?context=explore) . Regarding machines, people have had luck with [r4.8xlarge EC2 (32 cores and 244 GB of RAM)](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/167#issuecomment-479738587), especially since the different steps of DeepVariant [utilize different amounts of resources](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-details.md). So FASTQ files are used to align to a genome reference sequence such as [GRCh38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000001405.26/) to generate BAM files. The recommended on is `GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.gz`, which you can download from the following location:. https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/001/405/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38/seqs_for_alignment_pipelines.ucsc_ids/. Regarding aligning your FASTQ file, that depends on your type of sequencer. If you are using PacBio HiFi it is recommended you use [pbmm2](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbmm2), otherwise you can use [bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa). Regading Docker containers for both, here are a couple of links:. [pbmm2](https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/pbmm2?tab=tags). [bwa](https://hub.docker.com/r/biocontainers/bwa/tags). Otherwise you can always use BioConda:. [pbmm2](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/pbmm2). [bwa](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/bwa).

Integrability,"ransversion)`, or `if Tv = 0` then it will be reported as a string formatted as `'variant_counts(is_transition) / 0'`. $`2)`$ The genotype is calculated as follows. Reads are collected, and sometimes realigned based on the model selected. Call sites are determined by an allele counter that goes through every position of aligned reads. For every viable call site it will generate a set of matrices based on your sets of aligned reads in that region - for some models it will perform local realignment. These matrices will limit themselves to a maximum of 95 reads (as it will downsample the reads if there are too many), with the first 5 rows representing the reference. This will then go through the model, and it generate three genotype probabilities: homozygous ref, het, and homozygous alt. Based on the maximum genotype probability, that will be used to generate the genotype (as the most likely). $`3)`$ The PL is generated from the 3 probabilities to generate the -10*log10() of the genotypes and zeroing to the most likely one (i.e. normalized with the highest genotype probability having PL=0). Now given the three steps above let's tie them together. Simplifying to the common factors, those would be: read realignment, read quality, and predicted genotype likelihoods. Read alignment and read quality determine the call site and type (i.e. SNP). Then these (via a matrix representation processed through a model) determine predicted genotype likelihoods, which in turn determine the GQ, PL and GT. TiTv counts depends strongly on how the call site was determined by the alignment of reads, and the [thresholds being set](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/FAQ.md#why-does-deepvariant-not-call-a-specific-variant-in-my-data). The GQ sometimes might be very low, which affects the GT (i.e. `./.`). This happens with every run, and if you are seeing discrepancies there are other factors that can affect it such as local alignment and read generation. Does that help?.

Integrability,"s [Stack Overflow post]( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55624506/running-docker-on-google-cloud-instance-with-data-in-gcsfuse-mounted-bucket) about the details of my installation and running of Docker on Google Cloud. I suspect there may be some more complications that I need to learn about (in terms of running Docker on Google Cloud, *using data stored in a Google Cloud Bucket*), but the messages that I get are different when using the DeepVariant container versus my own container. So, I thought it might be OK to post a question here. If I try to run [a script]( https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Genos_Exome/run_DeepVariant_3steps.sh) on Google Cloud that is similar to AWS (and based upon the very helpful [DeepVariant Exome Case Study]( https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.8/docs/deepvariant-exome-case-study.md)), I get the following error message:. ```; $ sh deepvariant_run_Exome_BWA_MEM_by-step.sh; Reading package lists...

Integrability,"thanks for your answer,. depends what acceptable is, is analysing 30depth chicken bam for 5h a good time? (I have 50 such genomes to process). I started building from source but quickly it stopped complaining about my python version.; I have ubuntu 20 on that server, luckily since it is apparently the only supported version. When I build from source, can I put myself in a virtenv or conda env with no risk of overwriting some system file or will it also put things in the OS path (/usr/...)?; I fear for my OS and do not dare to proceed in that direction. Finally, conda install does not install, which leaves me with only the docker which is not a perfect match for my cpus. This is all not really optimal! weird for one of the current leaders in variant calling, I was expecting a more carefully built set of docker(s) to match different cpu configurations.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/452#issuecomment-1497101051:25,depend,depends,25,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/452#issuecomment-1497101051,1,['depend'],['depends']

Integrability,"ting point, I was trying to work with calling variants from the .bam file provided for my WES data. I started running from within a Docker container on my local computer but that was taking a long time (and, ultimately, the _make_examples_ step did not run to completion). I started learning more about the AWS options for analysis, and I was able to run the _make_examples_ much quicker (and successfully) on an AWS m5.xlarge ECS instance (although I am admittedly well over the ~25 minutes and $0.20 time/cost mentioned for Google Cloud, just for the _make_examples_, without considering upload/download, long-term storage, etc.). While I was hoping to eventually compare running things on Google Cloud (and I think my experience so far probably helps me ask better questions), I was wondering if you could help me troubleshoot something that I think is probably close to working:. Essentially, I am currently at the **call_variant** step of DeepVariant, with WES data.

Modifiability," Python Module; 4) Downloaded and configured Tensorflow from GitHub (we might need to checkout the proper version). The final step is to build the DeepVariant binaries. Just a note, you will require several GB of space for this to work. The DeepVariant zip files we eventually get will be quite small. (The zip files are basically Python scripts and bytecode with a compiled shared library.). Regarding what's missing or incompatible during the build, we will let the compiler tell us that, which will make it a bit easier to troubleshoot. Just to be sure we minimize surprises, we will do a couple of things first. To ensure the TensorFlow code we will compile against is of the same version as the TensorFlow python package (2.11.0), run the following in your `git clone` TensorFlow folder (the assumption is that your TensorFlow folder is outside your DeepVariant one):. ```; # Assuming you are in the DeepVariant directory. cd ../tensorflow; git checkout origin/r2.11 -f. # Here configure like before with the defaults; ./configure. cd ../deepvariant; ```. Once in the DeepVariant directory, perform each of these separately so we can isolate any issues:. ```; #!/bin/bash; source settings.sh. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/deepvariant/r1.5/.bazelrc. bazel build -c opt ${DV_COPT_FLAGS} --build_python_zip :binaries; ```. You may notice that we removed `.bazelrc` previously, that was so that we can ensure while we troubleshoot the `bazel` installation nothing gets triggered by the `.bazelrc` config. The last two things you have to run to complete the DeepVariant build are the following, though the above should give most of what you need:. ```; #!/bin/bash; source settings.sh. bazel build -c opt ${DV_COPT_FLAGS} --build_python_zip //deepvariant/labeler:labeled_examples_to_vcf; ```. ```; #!/bin/bash; source settings.sh. bazel build -c opt ${DV_COPT_FLAGS} --build_python_zip :binaries-deeptrio; ```.

Modifiability," hyperparameters to optimise the training. . However . . . . I notice when tracking the model eval stats (specifically f1, precision, recall), that the hom_ref classifications are much less reliable than hom_alt and het classes. My question is whether this is to be expected, or whether there might be something wrong with my training setup, or perhaps the examples. . The test example set I am using to tune the hyperparams looks like this:. ```; # Generated by shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py; # class2: 89987; # class0: 33161; # class1: 24300. name: ""Shuffle_global""; tfrecord_path: ""/home/examples_shuffled/train/shuf_test/examples_shuf3_testset.shuffled-?????-of-?????.tfrecord.gz""; num_examples: 147448; ```.

During other tests I have run training jobs with several other example sets (several times larger), for tens of thousands of steps and multiple epochs, and also using different learning rates and batch sizes. While these things of course make a difference to learning performance, the lower recall for class 0 (hom_ref) remains consistent. . Here are some lines from the log file during one such training run:. ```; I1031 10:55:27.365902 140558597089024 logging_writer.py:48] [0] epoch=0, train/categorical_accuracy=0.91796875, train/categorical_crossentropy=0.6384725570678711, train/f1_het=0.7428571581840",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/904:1208,config,config,1208,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/904,1,['config'],['config']

Modifiability," the reference needed for reading the cram file. Pysam uses a similar approach. . **The REF_PATH and REF_CACHE**; One of the key concepts in CRAM is that it is uses reference based compression. This means that Samtools needs the reference genome sequence in order to decode a CRAM file. Samtools uses the MD5 sum of the each reference sequence as the key to link a CRAM file to the reference genome used to generate it. By default Samtools checks the reference MD5 sums (@SQ “M5” auxiliary tag) in the directory pointed to by $REF_PATH environment variable (if it exists), falling back to querying the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) reference genome server, and further falling back to the @SQ “UR” field if these are not found. While the EBI have an MD5 reference server for downloading reference sequences over http, we recommend use of a local MD5 cache. We have provided with Samtools a basic script (misc/seq_cache_populate.pl) to convert your local yeast.fasta to a directory tree of reference sequence MD5 sums:. <samtools_src_dir>/misc/seq_cache_populate.pl -root /some_dir/cache yeast.fasta; export REF_PATH=/some_dir/cache/%2s/%2s/%s:http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/cram/md5/%s; export REF_CACHE=/some_dir/cache/%2s/%2s/%s; REF_PATH is a colon separated list of directories in which to search for files named after the sequence M5 field. The : in http:// is not considered to be a separator. Hence using the above setting, any CRAM files that are not cached locally may still be looked up remotely. In this example “%2s/%2s/%s” means the first two digits of the M5 field followed by slash, the next two digits and slash, and then the remaining 28 digits. This helps to avoid one large directory with thousands of files in it. The REF_CACHE environment variable is used to indicate that any downloaded reference sequences should be stored locally in this directory in order to avoid subsequent downloads. This should normally be set to the same location as the first directory in REF_PATH.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/38#issuecomment-372143466:1798,variab,variable,1798,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/38#issuecomment-372143466,1,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability," these channels contains in their first 5 rows the reference representation as necessary. This way you can ensure reference representation together with alternate representation. If you have multiple alternates, then you have more images as [shown at the following PileupImageCreator() comment](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/deepvariant/pileup_image.py#L138-L197), to ensure the genotype is calculated with the best representation of possibilities. Now let me switch topics on how the model is constructed at a high level, as it is important for answering the questions. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the [Inception V3 architecture](https://iq.opengenus.org/inception-v3-model-architecture/), and was trained using a truth set of VCFs for confident regions using high-quality BAM files. A CNN basically slices with different sub-matrices (i.e. kernel) shapes within each channel to generate new summary layers of channels to use for further slicing or combining (pooling), with the eventual goal to match with a high probability a specific truth value in the VCF. The way this is done, is by varying the values in these networks of kernels (sub-matrices) until with high-probability the truth values as validated. This collection of trained kernels is what the PacBio model contains. So now to answer the two questions in order:. 1) If you think of the PacBio model retaining previously seen (trained) regions of portions of the channels, it will go through the kernel transformation pooled across the channels to determine the probabilities of genotypes. The highest value will be used to Phred-scale the GQ value. So it's a bit more complex as the sub-slices are taken across a 100 x 199 region for 6 channels, rather than just a 100 x 1 (where the majority ref-representation of alleles reside), but that will also have an impact in the matrix calculations of probabilities of most represented genotype. 2) Now if the probability is low, then the mod",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/666#issuecomment-1604221424:2380,layers,layers,2380,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/666#issuecomment-1604221424,1,['layers'],['layers']

If you are curious, you can read the papers and mathematics behind each approach, and you'll be surprised by their similarity in approaches of inferring the call and its probability (quality). I have included a list of papers with links in the reference section below. Now if the above is too easy, and you want to make _de novo_ variant calling more exciting, you can use the `glnexus` with the config `--config DeepVariant_unfiltered`, which is basically the following [Yaml config file](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/deepvariant/cohort_best_practice/DeepVariant_unfiltered_v1.yml) indicating to GLnexus to operate [under specific parameters conditions](https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/GLnexus/wiki/Configuration). So when you perform GLnexus joint variant calling, you will get the three sample columns (father/mother/child) in your joint VCF.

Otherwise if the read quality is good, and alignments are unique with proper coverage then it might actually be _de novo_, though the proband (child) calls are the more interesting ones. For this you would need to have more samples to ensure the calls are not false positives, with further IGV inspection and assay validation.

The test example set I am using to tune the hyperparams looks like this:. ```; # Generated by shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py; # class2: 89987; # class0: 33161; # class1: 24300. name: ""Shuffle_global""; tfrecord_path: ""/home/examples_shuffled/train/shuf_test/examples_shuf3_testset.shuffled-?????-of-?????.tfrecord.gz""; num_examples: 147448; ```.

During other tests I have run training jobs with several other example sets (several times larger), for tens of thousands of steps and multiple epochs, and also using different learning rates and batch sizes. While these things of course make a difference to learning performance, the lower recall for class 0 (hom_ref) remains consistent. . Here are some lines from the log file during one such training run:. ```; I1031 10:55:27.365902 140558597089024 logging_writer.py:48] [0] epoch=0, train/categorical_accuracy=0.91796875, train/categorical_crossentropy=0.6384725570678711, train/f1_het=0.7428571581840515, train/f1_homalt=0.964401364326477, train/f1_homref=0.902255654335022, train/f1_macro=0.; 8698380589485168, train/f1_micro=0.91796875, train/f1_weighted=0.9241795539855957, train/false_negatives=34.0, train/false_positives=14.0, train/learning_rate=9.999999747378752e-06, train/loss=0.6384731531143188, trai",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/904:1524,config,config,1524,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/904,1,['config'],['config']

I am running DeepTrio for a dataset with known true-positive SNPs and indels. I followed guidelines for DeepTrio but had to change --config DeepVariantWGS to DeepVariant_unfiltered at the glnexus_cli step as a default QUAL threshold of 10 removed a lot of my TP calls.; I have compared distributions of QUAL score in the TP subset and all calls found by DeepTrio. Please see an attached histogram of all DeepTrio calls vs TP calls. Could you please tell me if it is expected that QUAL of TP calls is between 0 and30, while there are calls with QUAL of up to 100? If not, what I could do wrong?; Thank you!.

You may follow steps from the official docker website https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository; 2. From the output it looks like you run it on a machine with 2 cores. In Google tutorial n1-standard-64 instance is used which has 64 cores. ; 3. From the output of the last command it is not clear what the error is. Could you post the command you used for creating an instance? It could be that call_variants command ran out of memory.; 4. Although Google tutorial page contains the pricing for pre-emptible instances it is only given for the reference. It is not recommended to run this tutorial on a pre-emptible instances because in the case the instance is preemted the job cannot restart automatically. More complex configuration (like Kubernetes) is required in order to use pre-emptible instances.; 5.

Perhaps upping this GQ to > 30 or slightly higher would remove this sites?

In general I'd recommend not doing this anyway, since this will eventually slow down any downstream processing of the gVCFs such as merging gVCFs using GLnexus, etc. I think the easiest way to achieve this would be by post-processing the gVCFs generated with `--gvcf_gq_binsize=1`. For example, the `break_blocks` option in [gvcftools](https://sites.google.com/site/gvcftools/home/configuration-and-analysis) seems to do this, based on an answer in this [forum](https://www.biostars.org/p/136461/).; > ; > May I ask what is your use case that prefers every non-variant position to be written?; > ; > Best, Ted.

Modifiability,"@A-Tsai Of course you can especially with `pipe()`, which can take a script/command as input. At the least, you have the following two options to play with:. 1. If you use pipe to launch a script, then you can launch the application through `taskset` to limit the number of cores at launch-time. Here's the options for launching with an example: . _*Options to launch a program*_: `taskset [options] mask command [argument...]`. _*Example to use only 2 specific cores*_: `taskset -c 0,2 python ~/loop.py`. The `pipe(...)` command [as defined in the RDD base-class](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD) takes an external command, which in this case would be `taskset -c core-list your-program`:. ![rdd-pipe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6555937/44763439-4c73f500-ab19-11e8-99d7-99adac28c913.png). 2. In Spark, you can also limit the number of cores per task in Spark through the `spark.task.cpus` setting. You probably want to set `spark.cores.max`, and not change the `spark.executor.cores` and `spark.driver.cores`. The Spark config page explains everything in more detail here: . https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html.

Modifiability,"@A-Tsai So now you're getting into determining your lineage graph of computations, which requires a lot of thought on how you set up your data and computational steps. Wide dependencies (multiple child partitions from the parent RDD) should be kept on the same node, while narrow dependencies (one child partition per parent RDD) can go over the network. Spark does hash partitioning to shuffle, and tries by the modulo of the number of partitions that it is somewhat uniformly distributed. Basically you should model your computation tree in order to best organize the data for good distribution and maximal local computation, otherwise you flood you network which slows down your completion-time. If you have 8 compute node with 4 cores each, then the node number will not change. The key to think about is the cores, but you have to determine to resource-allocate properly. The following can be helpful:. http://site.clairvoyantsoft.com/understanding-resource-allocation-configurations-spark-application/. Regarding task information, you get the duration here:. https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskInfo@finishTime:Long. You can control the policy with the application as noted here:. https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/job-scheduling.html#scheduling-within-an-application. You can control the assignment by creating pools with a `minShare` of cpu cores guaranteed for that pool. If you have one pool, then that can control it all - especially in FIFO mode - but that would not be efficient use of a Spark cluster. Spark has many moving parts, including how you structure your data and how to chose to process it (batch vs. stream). To properly perform this you have to analyze carefully the design of your computational DAG, and how your work should be processed given the resources. To me 200 partitions does not quite feel right, but if you think that is optimal for your design that's fine.

Modifiability,"@husamia Unfortunately usually is not a reliable description that can be applied to Docker, as it performs many layers of abstraction that can cause a spike when you are not even aware of it. 80% is definitely not enough, especially with the layers of abstractions that DeepVariant also adds.

Think about it this way, how would you even be able to tell if there is a 10 second spike when Docker starts using 97-98-99% of resources if you need to wait for the OS process resource queue to clear in order to check the Docker status, but are limited/prevented to do so by multiple layers of resource management systems?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/412#issuecomment-767885510:112,layers,layers,112,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/412#issuecomment-767885510,3,['layers'],['layers']

Modifiability,"@scott7z Well, my feeling is that would be too much work, which could be fostered elsewhere. Unless there is a defined criteria for working off a specific revision, it is usually less of a benefit to be tied to a specific release. It'll also make the cost of supporting it too much of a headache, as the other dependencies will continue to evolve. I always prefer to simplify and feel it's more practical to push compliance of dependencies to their maintainers, while expanding on the fun part of adding community-driven features. For example, there over 1000 commits between the two SHAs, and it would be hard to keep track of so many contributions:. ```Bash; $ git log | grep commit | cat -n | grep '97a4c226e8a9e7c5c36fc38e2b9f8459c77abd5a\|ab0fcaceda001825654424bf18e8a8e0f8d39df2'; 1 commit 97a4c226e8a9e7c5c36fc38e2b9f8459c77abd5a; 1244 commit ab0fcaceda001825654424bf18e8a8e0f8d39df2; $; ```.

Modifiability,"@sophienguyen01 can you try to run this again without using `--debug=true`? This runs tensorflow in eager mode which will be very inefficient. The other issue is that you don't have a checkpoint file because you didn't train long enough - and no checkpoint outperformed the existing performance on your tune dataset. Try re-running with `--debug=false` and `--config.num_epochs=10` and see where that gets you. If you get an OOM error with batch_size=512, reduce it and try again.

Modifiability,"Actually, what you are asking for I believe partially exists w.r.t. TensorFlow and our models. If you look at modeling.py you can see we aren't tied to InceptionV3 directly. We have trained DV models with mobilenet and ResNet, for example. . And we aren't tied to a specific version of TensorFlow. You can build your own optimized version of TensorFlow from scratch with whatever configuration options you like (AVX, AVX2, MKL) and use that to get all of the performance benefit of your native chipset. I suspect that production-grade deployments of DeepVariant will use custom built, optimized TensorFlow wheels to maximize performance. In fact, it would be possible, with sufficiently advanced orchestration capabilities, to manage a family of TensorFlow wheels and conditionally load the maximally-performant version for the actual machine you are running on, if you are running on a heterogenous fleet (common both in cloud and on-prem). . Our challenge in providing a prebuilt binary is that we needed to come up with a *reasonable* default set of optimization flags, and requiring at least AVX seems reasonable to us given the gap (not on your chart) in performance between with and without AVX itself. As for decoupling from TensorFlow, I can tell you that we will not devote any cycles to that effort ourselves.

I may be still in the learning phase about some AWS things, but _m5.4xlarge_ (which is what I was using when I submitted the ticket) is listed as having 16 cores and 64 GB of RAM. I am currently testing running on an _r4.8xlarge_ EC2 instance (part of an ECS cluster, which has Docker installed) is listed as having 32 cores and 244 GB of RAM. If that doesn't work, I think I need to take more time to either look into other strategies (like keep trying to get things set up to run in AWS ""Batch"" and/or seeing if there might be a Docker configuration issue that I can change/fix) and/or go ahead and start my Google Cloud comparison. While I want to be fair and clear about having some costs associated with a learning curve, I've already spent more than $250 in ~2 weeks trying to test DeepVariant in the AWS system. So, in order for this to be a viable option over GATK (which I can run on my local computer for WGS data with 4 cores and 8 GB of ram), I need to be able to confirm that I can in fact perform Exome analysis on Google Cloud for $0.20 (and while ~25 min is not essential, I think you would need to update your page if those two metrics didn't apply to typical usage).

Modifiability,"Apologies in advance for inviting myself into the conversation. I think it's worth mentioning that while there are merits to doing MNV calling, the use-case given (calling amino acid variation from SNPs) isn't the greatest. There's no guarantee that codons occur as triplets in the genome (though they tend to, they can also get split across exons). which suggests that MNV calling doesn't actually solve the problem in general. Phase-aware consequence predictors (bcftools csq) should, on the other hand, work just fine (neglecting phasing errors of course). FWIW, we use the following pipeline: deepvariant or gatk4 -> whatshap -> shapeit4 -> bcftools csq to predict protein polymorphisms (or really, whole proteomes from whole genomes) and that approach should work in this case too. To be clear, having MNV calling would make an excellent addition to DeepVariant, it just may not be a total solution to the problem posed.; -August",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/486#issuecomment-984133927:677,polymorphi,polymorphisms,677,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/486#issuecomment-984133927,1,['polymorphi'],['polymorphisms']

Modifiability,"Gladly Stephane, and that's understandable though Docker containers usually reside under `/var/lib/docker`:. ```; $ docker info | grep Root; Docker Root Dir: /var/lib/docker; $; ```. Since Docker is container-based it doesn't see the operating system outside of its own isolated environment. That's why the `-v` parameter maps (bind-mounts) a folder from the outside, to be visible inside. Basically if you don't map in `/tmp`, the container is not aware of it at runtime, and continues to use space under `/var/lib/docker`, by creating new temporary layers of changes to its running image.

Modifiability,"Hello Andrew,. I am having the same problem... I am trying to call SNPs in a species with a very high density of SNPs, and short read callers do not perform well, they miss a lot of variants in cohort samples, resulting in ridiculously high mutation rates, or the opposite they reject everything as mapping errors. I am now turning to long reads... I have the hope to obtain a solid golden reference set. That might be useful for training a DeepVariant model with short reads.

Modifiability,"Hello,. We have found that a known de novo variant was missed when using DeepTrio and GLnexus in our pipeline (WGS, hg38). I know that a similar issue has already been raised and appreciate the interesting discussion on this (i.e. https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/440), but to recap for others this was the result of two contributing factors:. 1. DeepTrio being less confident in the de novo call for the proband than when DeepVariant is run in singleton mode on the proband. In our case, comparing the output VCFs from these two different runs we saw a reduction in the GQ score assigned to the variant from 56 when using DeepVariant in singleton mode, to only 10 when using DeepTrio.; 2. GLnexus filtering, according to the `DeepVariantWGS` configuration we were using, removing our variant of interest in the case of DeepTrio due to the low likelihood assigned to the call. To partly overcome this we are looking to switch the GLnexus configuration to `DeepVariant_unfiltered` as mentioned in https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/440. However we would like to further evaluate this change on a known truth set to determine the increase in false-positive calls (similar to [1] with DV-GLN-NOMOD vs DV-GLN-OPT, but for DeepTrio instead... because from what I understand that paper evaluated DeepVariant). I have seen that all three GIAB/NIST benchmark trios have been used as training data for DeepTrio so would like to ask:. 1. Were all chromosomes from these trios used to train the DeepTrio models? I believe the DeepVariant WGS training data excluded chr20-22, and the deeptrio test data uses HG001 Chr20 [2], so I assume chr20-22 were excluded from the Deeptrio models for each of the trios too and would be suitable for testing? Or any alternative suggestions for this?; 2. I understand that the DeepTrio docs aren't officially released yet, but would it be possible please to provide an overview of the workings and differences between the Child and Parent models for DeepT",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/475:755,config,configuration,755,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/475,2,['config'],['configuration']
Modifiability,"Hello,. We noticed that adjacent variants of the same haplotype (i.e. MNVs) are being called as separate variants in the DeepVariant and DeepTrio outputs with VCF and gVCF files. During downstream processing these MNVs are then treated as two individual SNVs at two different loci, leading to faulty assessments. . For example two variants for a site of interest (reference TCG -> Serine) were separated between two lines in the DeepVariant/DeepTrio output VCF and then categorised as containing a nonsynonymous (T**G**G -> Tryptophan) and synonymous mutation (TC**A** -> Serine). Whereas the correct and desired way to handle this, at least for us but I imagine others too, would seem to be to recognise both mutations on a single line in the VCF as a combined substitution, which could then be identified as resulting in a stopgain (T**GA** -> Nonsense mutation). Are there plans to support these MNV calls in the DeepVariant/DeepTrio outputs? Or alternatively are there any current post-processing approaches that you may be using and can recommend to handle these cases? Can understand these may be challenging to manage in some aspects but could be important to flag given some recent literature around this topic. For reference this was using hg38 with WGS. We initially identified this using the original DeepTrio release (docker image deeptrio:1.0.1rc), but then also using the most recent DeepVariant release (via docker, v1.2). We also tested this to see whether the change to the unfiltered GLnexus config could be contributing to this for processing of DeepTrio gVCFs due to the joint genotyping parameter, but reverting back to the WGS config did not result in a merged MNV in this instance. .

Modifiability,"Hey there,. I was able to get a training started up on GCP today. Here is what I did, hopefully it is helpful:.

Then I downloaded and set up some of the variables from the case study doc (https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.5/docs/deepvariant-case-study.md); I had to change N_SHARDS to be 8 since we have 8 cpus on this instance. Then I ran make_examples in training mode on a small portion of the genome to create some labeled training data. I adapted the command line from the one used in the case study. You would also want to randomly shuffle the data but I didn't do that here. ```; ( time seq 0 $((N_SHARDS-1)) | \; parallel --halt 2 --joblog ""${LOG_DIR}/log"" --res ""${LOG_DIR}"" \; python ""${BIN_DIR}""/make_examples.zip \; --mode training \; --ref ""${REF}"" \; --reads ""${BAM}"" \; --confident_regions ""${TRUTH_BED}"" \; --truth_variants ""${TRUTH_VCF}"" \; --examples ""${EXAMPLES}"" \; --regions ""20:10,000,000-12,000,000"" \; --task {}; ) >""${LOG_DIR}/make_examples.log"" 2>&1; ```.

Modifiability,"Hi @AndrewCarroll , . Thanks for the detailed reply. This is still kind of in early days. Our team is mostly from the National Museum of Natural History so we all work on a variety of taxa from snakes to plants. At this point we were trying to figure out the best non-model group(s) to start with because if we could start with a taxon with genome trios sequenced (or I suppose WES) then we could try the technique from the mosquito paper. But, in most cases with non-model groups we don't have any trios, and often we just have one representative genome that at times is not that well resolved. In terms of choosing test groups we could try one with genome characteristics more like humans, and then test of something more different. ; I certainly like the second suggestion of sampling the GIAB data, and if the genome in question is not too different then it could be a good approach. One thing we are thinking about is how far out evolutionarily you can extend the model we train. In a lot of pop gen and phylogenetic studies sampling is interspecific, and so we are also thinking about trying to evaluate how well a model would work across a clade or genus. The fact that DV worked well on mice is encouraging in this respect.

Modifiability,"Hi @Axze-rgb . We do have interest in potentially releasing some non-human models.

Modifiability,"Hi @Axze-rgb,. So we know that this organism replicates through clonal inheritance to transfer of mutations to daughter cells that would be driven by genetic drift or selection forces, and usually not by lineages. Though you say you noticed genetic clusters forming stemming from the ancestor population. So if the mutations are more localized and are still diploid, that means it would not behave in the way true germline diploid genomes would transfer their genotypes. This means you would have more alterations -- that might be real, or stem from sub-populations of clonal events affecting your sample purity -- and thus you cannot rely on ploidy to support your allele frequency (as illustrated by your plot above). This is of course assuming artifacts of sequencer errors, and others are removed. So instead you would need to do something like ""panel of clonals"" to compare against, to compare between clonal events. Then among these you would denoise for the common variants, so you can construct a phylogenetic analysis how the mutations evolve. All these alterations you would need to validate through your reads supported by multiple replicates. Though you are fighting your clonal events here, and would need to validate that the coverage of the labeled events (samples) in your cohort study are individually relatively consistent in the specific variant distribution (i.e. you want no/minimal heterogeneity of samples contaminating each individual labeled sample). This way your samples are comparable. Based on the above, hope it makes sense why the `./.` and `0/0` make sense to analyze. Given that you cannot rely on the ploidy for your allele frequency, this can also be illustrated by the diversity in allele frequency, instead of unique clusters you would normally observe in a true germline variant. Given that, there probably is heterogeneity in the sample purity of variants, which would lead to a spread of the VAF. Now you need to isolate the variants and determine their inherit",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/682#issuecomment-1650246876:71,inherit,inheritance,71,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/682#issuecomment-1650246876,2,"['evolve', 'inherit']","['evolve', 'inheritance']"

Basically just freely ask, and someone here can get you there quicker :). You did great, and only a few minor things:. $`1)`$ So you are correct that you will need the index file, as DeepVariant uses [Nucleus](https://github.com/google/nucleus), which in turn uses [HTSlib](https://github.com/samtools/htslib/blob/master/hts.c#L4508-L4559), and will complain with an error like this (when trying to locate it):. ```; [E::idx_find_and_load] Could not retrieve index file for '/input/mysorted.bam'; ```.

Modifiability,"Hi @BowenKwan you can try modifying the `PILEUP_DEFAULT_WIDTH` contant in [this file](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.10/deepvariant/dv_constants.py#L41). I didn't try this myself, so some additional changes may be needed, but this is a good place to start. For local training, copying the data files locally and updating paths makes sense. Some other changes you will need are below. Does the machine you plan to use have a GPU?. * Run the `model_train` and `model_eval` binaries directly, rather than running via Docker. Examples on how to use binaries directly are in [this WES case study script](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.10/scripts/run_wes_case_study_binaries.sh). DeepVariant comes with scripts to build binaries on Ubuntu, with Ubuntu 16 recommended. Binaries can only be built for a UNIX-based OS.

Modifiability,"Hi @Fred-07,. As @akolesnikov mentions, the reason that the reads are re-aligned in this way has to do with some fundamental aspects of how alignment penalties work. The alignment method, Smith Waterman, has alignment score penalties for gap open and gap extend. These penalties make the alignments you see as scoring higher than ones that open and extend a gap early in the repeat. Those alignment penalties are determined from looking at mismatch, insertion, and deletion rates across large amounts of homologous sequences. They work very well for high sequence complexity regions which have standard types of DNA replication error. In this highly repetitive context, the ways that sequence (specifically repeats) can be extended or deleted is a bit different. It might, in theory, be possible to derive better gap extend scores for regions like this, but this is both very hard and a more fundamental problem. I don't think this case is one we can easily solve without very extensive work. . I hope that the @akolesnikov suggestion of turning off realigner in regions of interest will be satisfactory.

Modifiability,"Hi @GaianX39,. Did you use WhatsHap to improve accuracy? The recommended way is to run `DeepVariant -> WhatsHap -> DeepTrio`, as [noted here for adding an additional signal of information for variant qualification](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/689#issuecomment-1660748817). DeepTrio is complex, as it combines the child and parent information together, since models were trained with the assumption that the child resides in the middle between the two parents (as in the pileup image shown below):. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/080684de-68b9-4f8b-8c45-1625484d96af). When that happens, candidate alleles that were generated by `make_examples` could have lower quality probabilities (going through the model), as by design it is selected across all samples (which might not yield high probability for a genotype). Truth set just means what expected variants from a gold standard you might have for your study, or in case of DeepTrio's that were [used to train the model](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-training-case-study.md#training-set), as listed here:. https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deeptrio-details-training-data.md. Another way you can compare against is to use `DeepVariant -> WhatsHap -> DeepVariant -> GLnexus` [as shown here](https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2021-02-08-the-haplotype-channel/). The truth sets are there based on expected results for a controlled experiment. If you know the variants do not follow normal Mendelian inheritance patterns, such as de novo ones, then you would need more replicate samples to validate against - which might also require validation via other assays.

Modifiability,"Hi @JakeHagen . Thank you for the report, and for including the quality readout from the HTML file. One thing I want to mention is that this distribution is something that we have seen in some samples - see Figure 1 of [Accurate, scalable cohort variant calls using DeepVariant and GLnexus](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/24/5582/6064144). In this figure, some of the analyzed cohorts do have bimodal GQ distributions for DeepVariant calls, while others (e.g. GIAB) do not. Supplementary Figure 3 of that paper indicates that a reasonable component of the bimodal distribution relates to sequence depth, at lower sample sequence depths, GIAB becomes more bimodal. I believe that we internally stratified calls and (though my memory is hazy) found that another factor in the bimodal distribution is whether a site is HET or HOM. Specifically, HET sites with lower depth have lower GQs, and I believe the explanation for this is that as coverage drops, it can become difficult to tell a HET site from either a REF or HOM, while HOM sites have more effective signal for them as non-REF. I don't think that the model is likely to be less confident in 100bp reads because they are not as much of the training data, but I expect the fact that 100bp reads are harder to uniquely map and will results in more variability in the coverage of high-MAPQ reads would indirectly contribute.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/586#issuecomment-1320629275:1321,variab,variability,1321,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/586#issuecomment-1320629275,1,['variab'],['variability']

Modifiability,"Hi @Npaffen . This is an interesting question. One advantage is that is these sites give a complete accounting of all positions that the neural network acts on. This makes it easier for us to debug issues (either internally or user-presented) as we remove the variable of whether a row in the VCF was not present because a candidate was not generated, or because the neural network decided it was reference. From a developer perspective (whether internal or external), this is much cleaner. . There is another advantage in allowing users to determine the ideal threshold for sensitivity (e.g. if they highly value sensitivity, they may want to consider positions which are ./. calls of low GQ). These are more advanced use cases and it does seem that most users opt for simpler approaches. . I also tend to think that including these variants won't confuse users, and that they would be used to variant callers using things like the FILTER field to indicate non-variant calls.

Modifiability,"Hi @aderzelle . Thank you, this is a good question. We have observed this phenomenon as well. The answer is somewhat complicated. . DeepVariant seems to have learned something about the concept of segmental duplication, where positions that appear to be variants are actually due to mismapping of similar regions which may (or may not) be captured in the reference genome. The way this manifests in a genome pileup is as one phased haplotype that is mostly reference and (one or more) phased haplotype that is variant-dense. The signal for this is further enhanced when the VAF is closer to 0.33 or 0.25 (more directly suggesting copy number 3 or 4), but it can also occur close to 0.5 (which can still indicate a copy number of 4). These regions can be variants in thee diploid genome that are incorrectly called as REF, or they could be markers of a copy number variant. In human genomes, this can suggest a user look into that region for either known copy number variants or coverage differences. One question to ask - are these regions at generally higher coverage than you would expect? . In certain variant-dense species, we have observed this phenomenon to complicate calling [in this blog we investigate this for mosquito genomes](https://google.github.io/deepvariant/posts/2018-12-05-improved-non-human-variant-calling-using-species-specific-deepvariant-models/). In this blog, we show the ability to re-train for a variant-dense species using a pedigree. If you have a pedigree available, we could also explore this with you. We are working on ways that will allow DeepVariant to more explicitly indicate when it thinks this is the case, and to provide more information (e.g. average coverage in the sample) to DeepVariant that will allow it to better separate variants from makers of segmental duplication.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/266#issuecomment-580713806:556,enhance,enhanced,556,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/266#issuecomment-580713806,1,['enhance'],['enhanced']

Modifiability,"Hi @aderzelle, thank you for your question. I believe this is coming from the cohort merging step (by GLnexus) assuming that you used `--config DeepVariantWGS` or `--config DeepVariant` for merging, not the DeepVariant itself. The merging step by GLnexus includes filtering alleles and revising genotypes and we have conducted an extensive study [1] on finding the best merging parameters for DeepVariant outputs, which was later pushed to the open-source GLnexus. The current version of the merging parameters uses `min_AQ1 = min_AQ2 = 10` (AQ means ""allele quality"") as you can see here https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/GLnexus/blob/4d057dcf24b68b33de7a9759ae65ca2b144a3d47/src/cli_utils.cc#L874 The definitions of these parameters can be found at https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/GLnexus/wiki/Configuration . I believe this is the reason why you are seeing the sharp drop at `GQ = 10` as the alleles corresponding to them were already filtered. If you'd like to merge DeepVariant gVCFs without any filtering or genotype revision, you can download the `.yml` file here https://gist.github.com/tedyun/1d4f57ca67fb18647b7b251f9e0b35c2 and use `--config DeepVariant_nomod.yml` instead when running GLnexus.

There are a large number of differences in the error profile of WGS and WES, including capture kit efficiency, additional errors from PCR in preparation, differences in the amount of on-target reads, greater coverage variability in exomes, and probably many other factors that are not completely understood. This paper: https://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5473 is probably a good place to start on some of the factors that differ between the assays. For deduplication, we use Picard MarkDuplicates as run by GATK.

Modifiability,"Hi @anands-repo . With respect to your second point - The starting training data begins from various coverages, ranging roughly from 27x-60x. From the starting coverage of the BAM files, downsampling is applied in 0.1 increments until the coverage would reach around 20x. As a result, higher coverage ranges are slightly less represented than the 30x-20x range, but not by a substantial amount. There are two main purposes of this - the first is to allow DeepVariant to perform well across many different coverages. The second is to ensure that there are many hard examples to learn from. Our strategy in downsampling is not fixed - for example, as we add more training data in the future, we may decide to have fewer downsample increments to generally keep the same range of examples. The coverage range has also evolved over time, for example in v0.7, the range was roughly 60x-30x. Extending the range to 20x caused a very small decline in accuracy at 50x (and also therefore the case study), but resulted in more substantial gains in the 20x-30x range. I would stress that there isn't one correct downsampling strategy, as long as it represents a diversity of coverages and helps create hard examples.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/230#issuecomment-546050008:814,evolve,evolved,814,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/230#issuecomment-546050008,2,"['Extend', 'evolve']","['Extending', 'evolved']"

Modifiability,"Hi @cwarden45, just to make sure I understand correctly, does your time estimate of 24 hours on Google Cloud include upload time to the machine?. 1a) ; The 5 hour runtime is based on performance on a specific set-up: a 64-core CPU-only setup (which is not the most cost-optimized configuration for running DeepVariant). We state this runtime as a baseline, and mention that many accelerated pipelines exist that allow WGS to run as fast as 40 minutes. I want to clarify the runtimes a bit more. Previously, our estimates for speed was based on the GCP cloud-orchestration framework developed external to our team. The speed-optimized one here is 70 min. However, as there are now multiple orchestration options (including Parabricks and ATGENOMIX) we have decided to separate the single-machine runtime from what can be achieved with orchestration. I understand you are running on your own local hardware, note that the speed will be a function of how new your CPU is, the AVX acceleration used by DeepVariant runs faster on newer machines. However, your estimation of 24 hours on a 4-core machine is 96 total core-hours. This is not particularly slow for DeepVariant, in fact, it is fast. The DeepVariant WGS case study finishes in 242 core-hours, though it is probably possible to finish somewhat more efficiently on a smaller machine. However, if you are able to run GATK Best Practices in 96 CPU hours, this would be surprising based on external estimates, which place the total compute at 300-400 CPU-hours (e.g - https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/LY1OY9XJ). When you say you are using an identical command on Google Cloud, are you also using identical hardware?. 1b); With respect to cost, a large factor in the cost-efficiency of DeepVariant will be whether you are using pre-emptible instances on GCP, or spot instances on AWS.

Modifiability,"Hi @digitalemerge. There isn't technically anything stopping the current DeepVariant models from calling structural variants, and in fact we have seen this happen, especially with PacBio reads. The main limitation is that the current way DeepVariant identifies variants is by looking within the read alignment signatures. SVs won't usually be captured within each short read, which is why most SV callers use split read or discordant pair signatures, something DeepVariant doesn't do because it was designed for calling small variants. In long reads, DeepVariant actually does capture some larger insertions and deletions as a natural extension of calling small indels, but it isn't perfect because SVs generally don't show up as neatly in the reads as small variants do. That is why dedicated SV callers like [pbsv](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbsv) have methods built-in to evaluate evidence from reads that don't match perfectly. That being said, we are exploring some strategies and experimenting with how we might extend DeepVariant to call structural variants. Of course, you and anyone else out there who is interested in experimenting with DeepVariant should also feel free to do so!.

Modifiability,"Hi @ekofman , ; thanks for reporting this!. It seems like you're using the example from the WGS case study. From my experience, suppose you on a 4-core machine, if you specify a $numShards bigger than 4 (say, 64), `parallel` will actually still just run 4 at a time. Therefore, it might run 0-3 first. And when they finished, `parallel` will proceed with the range of 4-7, etc. Because of that, if you run 64 shards on 4-core machine, you won't see all 64 jobs started at the same time. Can you first confirm whether that's the case for you? ; In your case, if somehow all 64 `make_examples` started on the same machine that 4 cores, it is possible that the machine starts becoming resource constrained and swapping a lot, therefore nothing will finish. But the first thing will be to check whether `parallel` handles this for you (which is my experience in the past).; @ekofman , please let me know what you observe. And, it'll also be useful to know how many cores are on your machine, and how much RAM.

Modifiability,"Hi @jaspez yeah my apologies - when I read your comment more carefully, it seemed like you used `1`, so I removed my previous answer. `--gvcf_gq_binsize=1` will only merge records when they have identical GQ values, so there would be no loss of information at least in terms of GQ, but as you already saw this will not be exactly the same as what you specified (single line per position). Unfortunately we do not currently have an option to keep every single non-variant position, as this would make the gVCF files extremely large. In general I'd recommend not doing this anyway, since this will eventually slow down any downstream processing of the gVCFs such as merging gVCFs using GLnexus, etc. I think the easiest way to achieve this would be by post-processing the gVCFs generated with `--gvcf_gq_binsize=1`. For example, the `break_blocks` option in [gvcftools](https://sites.google.com/site/gvcftools/home/configuration-and-analysis) seems to do this, based on an answer in this [forum](https://www.biostars.org/p/136461/).

Modifiability,"Hi @jumpyknight ,. We have also noticed that when warmstarting from a checkpoint, there seems to be dip in accuracy at the beginning. You can see an example like this in this plot in our training case study from r0.7:; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/deepvariant/r0.7/docs/images/TensorBoardAccuracy.png. And specifically, for a while it was puzzling to us why model.ckpt-0 was much less accurate. After looking much closely into TensorFlow and the behavior or warmstarting, here is what we found:. It turns out that there's some subtlety to what exactly gets loaded in warm starting. It's documented here:; https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/warm_start; Specifically, this:; ```; vars_to_warm_start: [Optional] One of the following:; * A regular expression (string) that captures which variables to warm-start (see tf.get_collection). This expression will only consider variables in the TRAINABLE_VARIABLES collection -- if you need to warm-start non_TRAINABLE vars (such as optimizer accumulators or batch norm statistics), please use the below option.; ```; Because in our code, we use a regular expression like this:; https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/aff131aac3bd0cb63ee8314e32bcbf5590987fb8/deepvariant/modeling.py#L361. This means that only the variables in the TRAINABLE_VARIABLES get loaded when we warm start.; This explains why warm starting from a checkpoint does not produce the same (or even similar) results as the inference/prediction mode. For example, Batch norms were not being warmstarted. If you do want to load **everything**, one trick we've tried is to change to code into a list:; ```; vars_to_warm_start=['|'.join(vars_to_include)]); ```; which then tricks the code into the model of loading everything (not just TRAINABLE_VARIABLES). But, it doesn't seem very desirable because it also loads things like global_step. The best way is probably to include just BatchNorm and the Trainable variables we want, but it'll require more refactoring",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/185#issuecomment-494919509:813,variab,variables,813,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/185#issuecomment-494919509,2,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"Hi @kokyriakidis ; MKL is an important part of the speed improvement for the `call_variants` step in the v0.7 release.; We don't currently have tried on AMD, so I can't say what the performance will be like. I'd like to learn more if you try it and have some numbers to share. . In general it's pretty difficult for the DeepVariant team to give advice on hardware or fine-tuning for a specific configuration. I usually think of that as an open-ended research problem itself, because many factors could come into play. I think @pgrosu 's advice above is the best. Start documenting numbers with your current configuration, continue with various hypotheses (""can I use less RAM?"", ""am I building with the optimized flags for my setting?"", etc) and trying them out. Continue to document the numbers and see if your hypotheses got proved or disproved. If you have any observations that are different from the statement we made in our GitHub documentations, we'd really appreciate you let us know. Your original question (in the title) is interesting - I only recently heard about Tensor Cores.

The chromosome names in the BAM (I, I, III, IV, V, X, MtDNA) differ from those in your original reference file (chrI_pilon, chrII_pilon), etc... This is what is causing the first error, DeepVariant requires chromosome names to match in order to run. The second error is a bit harder to diagnose, but I would guess this is because the sequence of your reference genome does not extend as far as some of the mapping positions in the BAM file. My suspicion is that the reference length is mismatched, but it might be possible that the reference sequence ends in real genomic DNA that reads are mapping to (and then extending beyond the reference length) and this causes DeepVariant to fail (I haven't seen this before, but it could be a plausible behavior).

Modifiability,"Hi @raphaelbetschart,. It's beginning to feel more and more there are some issues with this site. With a mappability score so low for that region, and a 4000x depth recovering only 203 reads, suggests multiple scenarios one of which could be as Andrew mentioned of segmental duplication. This would require more analysis of the region and the reads, one of which could be as Andrew suggested varied isoforms. Keep in mind DeepVariant will also [cap the reads at 1500](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/FAQ.md#how-are-ad-and-dp-values-calculated) if the depth is too high. Another thing about low mappability is that for the WGS model there will be local realignment triggered, and that can result also in the lower number of reads. To get a BAM of your realigned reads for that region, just add the following to your DeepVariant script:. ```; --make_examples_extra_args=""emit_realigned_reads=true,realigner_diagnostics=/output/realigned_reads; ```. as described in the [FAQ section](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/FAQ.md#what-is-the-realigner-and-how-does-it-work) or in the [following comment](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/691#issuecomment-1662968609).

After you relaunch the script, the BAM file(s) representing that region would be the one you would use in IGV. What percentage of your call sites exhibit this behavior?

Modifiability,"Hi @shadrinams . My apologies for the delay in reply. It took me awhile to get to this issue. I have some thoughts about how to improve consistency in the trio calling that may help some of these cases. But it may take a bit of time to explore those. For the chr7_54624683 case, I suspect there is some interaction with the variant call and the normalization done by GLnexus. When I look at the VCF for the Proband and Father, I see:. Proband; ```; chr7 54624686 . A ATC 61.6 PASS . GT:GQ:DP:AD:VAF:PL 0/1:61:39:17,21:0.538462:61,0,7; ```; Father; ```; chr7 54624686 . A ATC 54.8 PASS . GT:GQ:DP:AD:VAF:PL 0/1:55:33:18,15:0.454545:54,0,68; ```. In my GLnexus VCF, I also see the following line, which has a call in both the child and the father (the variant position is a bit different, but this does seem to reflect the reads I see in the sample). ; ```; chr7 54624686 chr7_54624686_A_ATC A ATC 61 . AF=0.333333;AQ=61 GT:DP:AD:GQ:PL:RNC 0/1:33:18,15:55:54,0,68:.. 0/0:32:32,0:50:0,180,1799:.. 0/1:39:17,21:61:61,0,76:..; ```. Would you mind pasting the command that you used to merge the gVCFs from this sample? When you jointly genotyped, were there also other samples at the time of joint genotyping, or was it only this sample?. For reference, this is the command that I used on the gVCFs of the files to generate this gVCF:. ```; sudo apt-get -y install bcftools; sudo apt-get -y install tabix; sudo docker pull quay.io/mlin/glnexus:v1.2.7. sudo docker run \; -v ""${PWD}/outputs"":""/outputs"" \; quay.io/mlin/glnexus:v1.2.7 \; /usr/local/bin/glnexus_cli \; --config DeepVariantWGS \; /outputs/Child_chr7_54624683.g.vcf.gz \; /outputs/Father_chr7_54624683.g.vcf.gz \; /outputs/Mother_chr7_54624683.g.vcf.gz \; | bcftools view - | bgzip -c > outputs/GitHub440.cohort.vcf.gz; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/440#issuecomment-836280023:1562,config,config,1562,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/440#issuecomment-836280023,1,['config'],['config']

Modifiability,"Hi @tgelafr-btx , thanks for waiting. It took me a while to get back to this. Before I share my work log, one observation from your error earlier:; It seems like you're using Python 3.10. Note that DeepVariant 1.5.0 is bulit with Python 3.8. So, can you try with Python 3.8?. ---. Here is what I tried. On a GCE instance, I ran:. ```bash; wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh; bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -u -p $HOME/miniconda; eval ""$(${HOME}/miniconda/bin/conda shell.bash hook)""; ```. Then, I ran:. ```bash; conda config --add channels defaults && \; conda config --add channels bioconda && \; conda config --add channels conda-forge; conda create -y -n dv-env deepvariant; conda activate dv-env; ```. Which seems to work (without error). I don't actually know how to use conda (or deepvariant in conda). But I did see the files here: . ```; (dv-env) pichuan@pichuan-cpu:~$ ls /home/pichuan/miniconda/envs/dv-env/share/deepvariant-1.5.0-0/binaries/DeepVariant/1.5.0/DeepVariant-1.5.0/; call_variants.zip licenses.zip model_train.zip runtime_by_region_vis.zip; call_variants_keras.zip make_examples.zip multisample_make_examples.zip settings.sh; deeptrio make_examples_somatic.zip postprocess_variants.zip show_examples.zip; freeze_graph.zip model_eval.zip run-prereq.sh vcf_stats_report.zip; ```. These are probably the files that were packaged with the last release: https://github.com/google/deepvariant/releases/tag/v1.5.0. @tgelafr-btx Question for you: Have you consider using Docker or Singularity, which are better supported by our team?

Modifiability,"Hi Amy,. That makes perfect sense now, and the realigned BAM file confirms the counts within expected values produced by the VCF. Basically it will realign unless you add the `--norealign_reads` (or `--realign_reads=false`), as Pi-Chuan [mentioned earlier](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/691#issuecomment-1662968609). So when you used the regular BAM file it realigned the reads -- because the above parameter is has a default value of `True` -- and when you used the realigned BAM file, it didn't need to align much or at all. The parameters used are defined as follows:. * `realign_reads` -> If `True` (the default value) then it will locally realign reads before calling variants. * `emit_realigned_reads` -> This will produce realigned reads if the `realigner_diagnostics` variable is also enabled. * `realigner_diagnostics` -> If this variable is not empty (i.e. set with a path), then the above and the DeBruijn graph will be saved, otherwise if it is empty the realigned BAM or Graphviz (dot) files will not be saved. There is always more that can be done if you really want to be sure, but this is fairly satisfactory. By the way, VCF files can also be loaded in IGV as well so that the comparison can be done directly. Hope it helps,; ~p",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/691#issuecomment-1670332454:791,variab,variable,791,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/691#issuecomment-1670332454,2,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"Hi Fra,. So let me go through a few items:. $`1)`$ It fails to find variant candidates in the `make_examples` stage. Assuming the reads were generated from Illumina whole-exome sequencing (WES), this BAM file is fairly large. To troubleshoot, it is best to specify a smaller region you know candidates should be, as you will need significant memory for this to work for the the whole genome. The flag specifying a region is of this format, and adjust accordingly for your best candidate region of your study: . ```; --regions ""chr20:10,000,000-10,010,000""; ```. You can just use Docker as you are running using that already (via `docker run`), to keep the number of variables small. Before you run Docker again, please look at the next two items as well. $`2)`$ Assuming you used the same reference sequence file (`Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta`) to perform the alignment, please run the following command (also you don't need to mark duplicates with DeepVariant):. ``samtools view -H $FQ.align.sort.marked.bam``. You can provide this via a gist or an attachment. $`3)`$ To perform a preliminary QC on your BAM file can you run the following command:. ``samtools flagstat $FQ.align.sort.marked.bam``. You can provide this via a gist or an attachment. If you have `fastQC` you can perform the following to generate the report, which you can attach a printed PDF file of the HTML output -- or you can attach the html with the accompanying zip file, if that is easier:. ` fastqc $FQ.align.sort.marked.bam`. $`4)`$ When you run the `docker run` command for `run_deepvariant` could you please provide the full output, to see where it gets stuck with errors, or how it completes. Also how much memory and disk space is freely available on the VM? I'm assuming the BAM file is several gigabytes.

Modifiability,"Hi Mark (@depristo),. Sorry, I meant to put this together a while ago - regarding https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/27#issuecomment-364683474 - but got a bit swamped with a research deadline. In any case, this is purely for intellectual curiosity and discussion. Regarding the first point, where differences in allocated CPUs might be the cause for the timing, that could be remedied by specifying a minimal CPU requirement, as noted here:. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform. So to control for the variability in the test, the two options are either: a) to set the `--min-cpu-platform` setting to the maximum available (`""Intel Sandy Bridge""`), or b) to keep requesting and canceling instances until the desired one is allocated on which all tests should be performed, thus satisfying consistency. Just as a quick inspection, by looking at the CPU cycles utilization, I just ran a performance analysis of 0.4 and 0.5.1 on `make_examples` - since it displayed the initial discrepancy - and there seem to be some slight increases in `0.5.1`, which might cumulatively affect things.

Though it would have been nice to have it highlight the `--use_tpu` flag option and `0.7.0` version, rather than the `0.6.x`. The tags in the docker images for the runner are still as a release candidate `0.7.0rc1`, with `0.6.1` as the `latest`. In any case, you guys are doing great work, and there is quite a lot of expertise on this side of the world as well to expand on DeepVariant's capabilities, and foster an even greater community.

Version 0.7 seemed to have just dropped out of the sky without any formal review process, and we could have helped you iron out some of the kinks (i.e. such as minor spelling on the [TPU case study](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r0.7/docs/deepvariant-tpu-training-case-study.md#shuffle-each-set-of-examples-and-generate-a-data-configuration-file-for-each) [s/Optoinal/Optional]). Your [Docker documentation](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/master/docs/deepvariant-docker.md#run-the-pipeline) still lists your image to use as `0.4.1`, which has an older channel representation of the input data - though using `latest` is a comment that might make a new user not realize the amount of difference between the versions. Some things seemed a bit rushed, and doing it together would have provided more eyes with expanded tutorials for attracting new users to lower any barriers to entry for new users - who can be quite picky when trying out new software.

Modifiability,"Hi Sami,. That's great news! Yes, example tfrecords is what you want -- this creates the variant candidates with the accompanying images. Whatever gets you to the right result is a good solution, and it's a team effort to quickly get you there. Understanding what exactly is being -- or not being created -- and why is just as important, so you have full insight of the steps of the experiment. Just from your setup I can infer you are probably running data from a PacBio sequencer. You can go down some nice rabbit holes with DeepVariant, if you really want to understand the process. The models for different types of sequencers where optimized with specific parameters in mind -- some more flexible than others. The `make_examples` step generates the right image configurations for those, or you can rely on `run_deepvariant` to do that for you -- ideally all your parameters were properly interpreted in Python. Though the models can at times be resilient under some data conditions, you want to provide the right data to the correct model to be sure your results are properly interpreted as they were naturally optimized under those conditions :).

Modifiability,"Hi Sophie,. Regarding requirements for resources, it all depends on how large your data is that you need to process. Also only the middle step `call_variants` can utilize 1 GPU if you prefer, but you can run the CPU version of DeepVariant. Below are the two Docker versions:. [google/deepvariant:1.5.0 (CPU Version)](https://hub.docker.com/layers/google/deepvariant/1.5.0/images/sha256-6a27bc877db9191c8fad0fe5f98dce6192fd4eb6392551e1a3add8d01e08af2e?context=explore).

Regarding machines, people have had luck with [r4.8xlarge EC2 (32 cores and 244 GB of RAM)](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/167#issuecomment-479738587), especially since the different steps of DeepVariant [utilize different amounts of resources](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/docs/deepvariant-details.md). So FASTQ files are used to align to a genome reference sequence such as [GRCh38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000001405.26/) to generate BAM files. The recommended on is `GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.gz`, which you can download from the following location:. https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/001/405/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38/seqs_for_alignment_pipelines.ucsc_ids/. Regarding aligning your FASTQ file, that depends on your type of sequencer. If you are using PacBio HiFi it is recommended you use [pbmm2](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbmm2), otherwise you can use [bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa).

Modifiability,"Hi Sophie,. So as you know, besides the genetic information passed on from the parents, each of us is born with an additionally small number of novel genetic changes called _de novo_ mutations (i.e. from environmental effects, etc). These traits are thus not passed from the parents, thus violating Mendelian inheritance. So when you use `rtg-tools mendelian` with the `--output` flag, it will save an updated VCF file annotated with calls violating Mendelian inheritance, thus highlighting the _de novo_ mutations. The information (header) fields in these updated annotated VCF files will have the following:. ```; ##INFO=<ID=AF,Number=A,Type=Float,Description=""Allele Frequency"">; ##INFO=<ID=MCV,Number=.,Type=String,Description=""Variant violates mendelian inheritance constraints"">; ##INFO=<ID=MCU,Number=.,Type=String,Description=""Mendelian consistency status can not be determined"">; ##FORMAT=<ID=GT,Number=1,Type=String,Description=""Genotype"">; ##FORMAT=<ID=DN,Number=1,Type=String,Description=""De novo allele"">; ##FORMAT=<ID=MCP,Number=.,Type=String,Description=""Describes the expected genotype ploidy in cases where the given genotype does not match the expected ploidy"">. ```.

Modifiability,"Hi Sophie,. So it is best to train across all the samples. The reason is that the model will need to be representative of all those samples, and you don't want to overfit for one sample over another. Today there is more data than computing power and memory, so training happens by batching the data, training on a batch, and then tweaking the model in the follow-up batches. Here's a visual example of what could happen:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/3ff13990-c2cc-4863-a904-bb0219791b06). In the first batch, the coefficients will be biased in a monotonically increasing function. Then when the second batch is used to tweak the model's parameters, it will shift towards a monotonically decreasing function shifting it towards an opposite direction. Then when the third batch comes in it will shift the parameters in the other direction. Sure, the independent variable (x-axis) here is a simple one-dimensional type, but this can become complex with multiple channels (`read base`, `base quality`, `mapping quality`, etc). And of course if the training data is shuffled, then the validation data and tuning data should also be shuffled in order to have the same data representation - with the exception of the test data, which will be used for benchmarking the model as a real scenario (though there is additional read shuffling when downsampling with too many reads for a pileup image). As @akolesnikov mentioned, the `input_pattern_list` parameter of the shuffle script takes a list of files, so you can do it all at once. Let me know if I should expand on anything.

Modifiability,"Hi all;; Thanks for all the help getting an initial conda package in place for DeepVariant (#9) through bioconda. I wanted to follow up with some suggestions that would help make the pre-built binaries more portable as part of this process, in order of helpfulness for portability:. - Currently the binaries need a recent kernel with GLIBC > 2.23 due to pre-built htslib and other libraries. Would it be possible to build the DeepVariant libraries on an older machine to allow a wider range of system support? We build on CentOS 6 in conda to provide wider compatibility.; - main.py in the zip files hardcodes python to use `/usr/bin/python`. Would it be possible to generalize this by using the python that the zip file gets called with (`sys.executable`)? I currently patch this in the conda build: https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/0a2d467d63d011015efeef4b644e985297b6b271/recipes/deepvariant/build.sh#L22; - This is currently built against numpy 1.13 and ideally we'd want to sync with CONDA_NPY (1.12: https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/blob/0a2d467d63d011015efeef4b644e985297b6b271/scripts/env_matrix.yml#L9). I believe building against 1.12 would make it forward compatible. An alternative to points 1 and 3 is making it easier to build DeepVariant as part of the conda build process. The major blocker here is the `clif` dependency which is difficult to build and the pre-built binaries require unpacking into `/usr`.

Modifiability,"I agree this issue is probably system specific. ; This creates a problem when using the container in nextflow since nextflow automatically configures few folder bindings when it prepares the run, namely the working directory, the directories of files staged into the process as inputs and the temp dir indicated by $TMPDIR.; Since it prepares all the scripts in advance, the $TMPDIR points to the standard /tmp location if I start nextflow from a login node, while in my system this is set to a node specific scratch space (/local scratch) when the job is submitted to a computing node by SLURM. Thus, I end up having the tmp dir not correctly mounted in the container. I'm not sure how common such a configuration is, so maybe it's a problem affecting just me and few others. What I've done is to add a line like this before the actual `run_deepvariant` command in my `script` section in the Nextflow process:; `export TMPDIR=""$PWD/tmp_dir""`. This overwrites the original variable and set the TMPDIR to a subfolder in the working directory.

Modifiability,"It depends on what you want. In the simplest case, people take the genome (fasta) + callset (vcf) as a representation of this individual's genome sequence. This is a bit simplistic, though, as it doesn't differentiate between regions where we are confidently the sample is the same as the reference vs. those where we are uncertain. That information is captured in the ""genome VCF"" or ""gVCF"" which DeepVariant can generate (see `--gvcf` in `make_examples`) but currently isn't so usable as the records come out in TFRecord of Variant proto format. We are working on adding support for creating a normally-formatted gVCF by extending postprocess_variants to merge those gVCF records and the callset together, which we hope to release soon. But in the meantime the best representation you can get from DeepVariant (without coding up merging logic for the gVCF yourself, which you are more than welcome to do) is VCF + genome. . I can't comment on the suitability of FastaAlternateReferenceMaker for your specific needs (despite being the original author of that tool) as I don't believe it was widely used or whether it is maintained now. I would post to biostars or other equivalent forum to ask for recommendations on what people typically do to combine a genome FASTA + VCF to make a diploid (or haploid) reference genome sequence. There are many options (e.g., FASTG, particularly important if you have diploid organisms) but I don't know what's widely used in the community.

Modifiability,"M is just a recurrent neural network that is memory efficient to remember past events without gradient instabilities, by going through the input forward and in reverse while getting output information from the previous step. All this means is that it has a bunch of weights and biases that the input (and previous output) progresses through in a time-series-like pattern -- traversing the input data both forward and in reverse -- remembering internally long-term dependencies stored as states. This means it is fairly memory efficient and fairly fast. In terms of sequence it captures the variants given a progression known by past progressions. As an analogy, given sequence of historical stock prices, can you predict the future stock price. Instead of stock price it produces variants. The ResNet is helpful to train faster as it is uses skip (shortcut) connection by utilizing the residual difference of input and output to learn from (residual learning). They use spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) for variable coverage of full-alignments. This still a convolutional neural network of weights and biases. It still operates like DeepVariant on channels constructed from your read information (`reference_base`, `alternative_base`, `mapping_quality`, `base_quality`, `strand_info`, `variant_type`, `insert_base`, `phasing_info`). What does this mean for you? We know your organism adapts significantly to the external environment. The deep learning models -- either DeepVariant or Clair3 -- have semi-fixed input assumptions. Sure they have been trained with some flexibility in the input data to capture some variability, but not to the extent that they will adapt to significant allele, or possible structural variation. I mean think of a convolutional neural network like this simplified example:. $`y\_output = weights_\gamma \cdot ( (weights_\alpha \cdot input + bias_\alpha) + (weights_\beta \cdot input + bias_\beta) ) + bias_\gamma`$.

It could also be due to not installing is in `/usr/local/bin` since I have to remain sandboxed in the work directory, but I did adjust the PATH to include the download location. Sorry I'm stuck here due to me limited knowledge of bazel tweaking. Either understanding how to handle a root install of the pre-build pyclif or tweaking to use the local python would be helpful. Alternatively, if you can already build DeepVariant on a CentOS6 system yourself I could use the pre-build binaries the way we're doing now, just with the build against an older glibc.

Modifiability,"Pichuan, to increase the ease use and expand adoption within the Bioinformatics community it might not hurt to have a collection of customized build-and-test environments at Google that match a variety of environment configurations that users have in place, or that common packages recommend out here. Sometimes folks will be curious to try out some new Bioinformatics software package, and the faster they get it to a running state on their own machines, the happier the experience enabling the community for that package to grow faster. Basically most people just want to use stuff - and want a turn-key solution - though some of us like tinkering with puzzles :) If their experience is good on something local - or even a cluster - then they'll see the obvious need to try it out on a Cloud environment. I sort of did it from the other side. Many times when I tested most of the GoogleGenomics tools, I would try them out in some real-world scenarios, I usually ran them against a variety of configurations. That helped with having better error messages, control flow decisions, documentation or additional features.

Modifiability,"Samtools use this approach to pass the reference needed for reading the cram file. Pysam uses a similar approach. . **The REF_PATH and REF_CACHE**; One of the key concepts in CRAM is that it is uses reference based compression. This means that Samtools needs the reference genome sequence in order to decode a CRAM file. Samtools uses the MD5 sum of the each reference sequence as the key to link a CRAM file to the reference genome used to generate it. By default Samtools checks the reference MD5 sums (@SQ “M5” auxiliary tag) in the directory pointed to by $REF_PATH environment variable (if it exists), falling back to querying the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) reference genome server, and further falling back to the @SQ “UR” field if these are not found. While the EBI have an MD5 reference server for downloading reference sequences over http, we recommend use of a local MD5 cache. We have provided with Samtools a basic script (misc/seq_cache_populate.pl) to convert your local yeast.fasta to a directory tree of reference sequence MD5 sums:. <samtools_src_dir>/misc/seq_cache_populate.pl -root /some_dir/cache yeast.fasta; export REF_PATH=/some_dir/cache/%2s/%2s/%s:http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/cram/md5/%s; export REF_CACHE=/some_dir/cache/%2s/%2s/%s; REF_PATH is a colon separated list of directories in which to search for files named after the sequence M5 field. The : in http:// is not considered to be a separator. Hence using the above setting, any CRAM files that are not cached locally may still be looked up remotely. In this example “%2s/%2s/%s” means the first two digits of the M5 field followed by slash, the next two digits and slash, and then the remaining 28 digits.

Modifiability,"So from what I see you've completed the following steps:. 1) Built and installed CLIF; 2) Installed Bazel; 3) Installed the Tensorflow Python Module; 4) Downloaded and configured Tensorflow from GitHub (we might need to checkout the proper version). The final step is to build the DeepVariant binaries. Just a note, you will require several GB of space for this to work. The DeepVariant zip files we eventually get will be quite small. (The zip files are basically Python scripts and bytecode with a compiled shared library.). Regarding what's missing or incompatible during the build, we will let the compiler tell us that, which will make it a bit easier to troubleshoot. Just to be sure we minimize surprises, we will do a couple of things first. To ensure the TensorFlow code we will compile against is of the same version as the TensorFlow python package (2.11.0), run the following in your `git clone` TensorFlow folder (the assumption is that your TensorFlow folder is outside your DeepVariant one):. ```; # Assuming you are in the DeepVariant directory. cd ../tensorflow; git checkout origin/r2.11 -f. # Here configure like before with the defaults; ./configure. cd ../deepvariant; ```. Once in the DeepVariant directory, perform each of these separately so we can isolate any issues:. ```; #!/bin/bash; source settings.sh. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/deepvariant/r1.5/.bazelrc. bazel build -c opt ${DV_COPT_FLAGS} --build_python_zip :binaries; ```. You may notice that we removed `.bazelrc` previously, that was so that we can ensure while we troubleshoot the `bazel` installation nothing gets triggered by the `.bazelrc` config. The last two things you have to run to complete the DeepVariant build are the following, though the above should give most of what you need:. ```; #!/bin/bash; source settings.sh. bazel build -c opt ${DV_COPT_FLAGS} --build_python_zip //deepvariant/labeler:labeled_examples_to_vcf; ```. ```; #!/bin/bash; source settings.sh. bazel build -c opt ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/657#issuecomment-1581784104:168,config,configured,168,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/657#issuecomment-1581784104,1,['config'],['configured']

Modifiability,"Thank you very much @pgrosu for such detailed answer! You are absolutely right. So, @amy-houseman, in summary, if a candidate variant passes all of the VSC's (very sensitive caller) thresholds and then the neural network prediction is confident on the genotype, `post_processing` will assign a PASS to the variant. One more thing to note, we train DeepVariant at several downsampled coverages so the model can capture the coverage variability of regions and different sequencing runs. This also makes DeepVariant robust to different coverages. Hopefully that answers your question. . @pgrosu, again thank you for such detailed and excellent answer.

Modifiability,"Thanks for your reply. Hopefully reads seem to map with a MAPQ of 60 so Deepvariant should see them. We believe the issue is high SNP density making some standing variant hard to call. It's also very possible there is no signal, i.e. the bdelloids have evolved a very low mutation rate and we are chasing ghosts. Since they reproduce asexually (at least in the lab) by automixis, it is a possibility. We developed a simple script, for each SNP that seems to be a de novo one, we look in the ancestral pileup, and we always find the SNP there but not called. I think the high density messes up callers internal maths, and some SNP get a low chance of being called. Anyway, the ONT sequencing is ongoing. We will see with the pileup there.

The thing is that the network would need to be tweaked by applying separate input convolutions for only channels that contain the spatial information and not others, as currently DeepVariant models are trained with a collection of channels of which some are only binary possibly only having some effect with more data as the other channels normalize -- though they might become more purposeful as filters.

""For somatic data or any other samples where the genotypes go beyond two copies of DNA, DeepVariant will not work out of the box because the only genotypes supported are hom-alt, het, and hom-ref."". Does the same apply to the RNA-seq model of DeepVariant? If a mutation has a low VAF is it predicted as hom-ref?. Because in RNA-seq, low VAF doesn't necessarily mean the variant is hom-ref in the genome. . ### In RNA-seq:; - **Expression Levels**: RNA-seq measures gene expression, so the VAF of a mutation depends on the expression of the mutant and wild-type alleles. If a gene is highly expressed in some cells and not others, or if only one allele is expressed (allele-specific expression), the VAF may be skewed.; - **Variable Expression**: The VAF in RNA-seq data can be influenced by tissue-specific expression, transcriptional noise, or RNA degradation, making it less consistent compared to DNA-seq.; - **Allelic Imbalance**: In RNA-seq, you might observe allelic imbalance due to factors like imprinting or preferential expression of one allele, further complicating the interpretation of VAF.",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/864:765,Variab,Variable,765,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/864,1,['Variab'],['Variable']

Background: the biggest issue with calling de novo variants (i.e. variants that are found in proband, generally as heterozygous, negative in parents) is there are ton's of false negative calls (Type II error) (i.e. variants not called in parents but are visually obvious in the alignment). .

Modifiability,"Yeah, but @pichuan folks will then ask the obvious question of what would be the right number of shards to get the correct variant calls. Probably some validation tests might be required with comparative benchmarks that show consistent predictability. I'm sure you guys have done some of this already, which would be nice if it could be shared for optimally configuration of the settings.

Modifiability,"Yes, if you use `run_deepvariant` (which is a wrapper for the 3 separate steps), the `*_extra_args` flags are just a more flexible way to allow you specify flags for each step. ; In `run_deepvariant`, we hard-coded some of the commonly used flags but not all of them. For example, you can't directly specify `--ws_use_window_selector_model` to `run_deepvariant`.; We thought people might eventually have use cases for all other less known flags. (Which is why the `*_extra_args` flags exist, but haven't been advertised or documented other than just the flag description. `make_examples_extra_args` description can be found here:; https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/97cd861800ccb43d750f392b518e99d514adddd8/scripts/run_deepvariant.py#L92-L96. Regarding the downside of turning off `ws_use_window_selector_model` in make_examples -- yes, it'll be slower. It's a small model where we used to decide whether we need to realign a window or not. When we set it to default, we found that it significantly decreased runtime, with negligible trade-offs. . You can find the description of this feature when it's first released in v0.7:; https://github.com/google/deepvariant/releases/tag/v0.7.0. ""Changed window selector to use a linear decision model for choosing realignment candidates. This can be controlled by a flag. `-ws_use_window_selector_model` which is now on by default.""",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/272#issuecomment-586546504:122,flexible,flexible,122,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/272#issuecomment-586546504,1,['flexible'],['flexible']

Modifiability,"aining a model (starting from wgs.1.6.1) for use in a fish species. The programs are running well, I have confident regions and truth variants defined, and am currently tuning hyperparameters to optimise the training. . However . . . . I notice when tracking the model eval stats (specifically f1, precision, recall), that the hom_ref classifications are much less reliable than hom_alt and het classes. My question is whether this is to be expected, or whether there might be something wrong with my training setup, or perhaps the examples. . The test example set I am using to tune the hyperparams looks like this:. ```; # Generated by shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py; # class2: 89987; # class0: 33161; # class1: 24300. name: ""Shuffle_global""; tfrecord_path: ""/home/examples_shuffled/train/shuf_test/examples_shuf3_testset.shuffled-?????-of-?????.tfrecord.gz""; num_examples: 147448; ```.

During other tests I have run training jobs with several other example sets (several times larger), for tens of thousands of steps and multiple epochs, and also using different learning rates and batch sizes. While these things of course make a difference to learning performance, the lower recall for class 0 (hom_ref) remains consistent. .

The key point to take away from this is not that there are options, but how these options internally work to infer the genotype and its probability given the data. Some work better with longer reads, and some with shorter reads. You want to play with them to get a feel of what is happening given different data. If you are curious, you can read the papers and mathematics behind each approach, and you'll be surprised by their similarity in approaches of inferring the call and its probability (quality). I have included a list of papers with links in the reference section below. Now if the above is too easy, and you want to make _de novo_ variant calling more exciting, you can use the `glnexus` with the config `--config DeepVariant_unfiltered`, which is basically the following [Yaml config file](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/deepvariant/cohort_best_practice/DeepVariant_unfiltered_v1.yml) indicating to GLnexus to operate [under specific parameters conditions](https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/GLnexus/wiki/Configuration). So when you perform GLnexus joint variant calling, you will get the three sample columns (father/mother/child) in your joint VCF. To determine a _de novo_ call, you just look for genotypes that would not follow Mendelian inheritance, such as `0/0 0/0 0/1`, such as:. ```; chr7 54624683 chr7_54624683_A_AATC A AATC 27 .

Modifiability,"and configured Tensorflow from GitHub (we might need to checkout the proper version). The final step is to build the DeepVariant binaries. Just a note, you will require several GB of space for this to work. The DeepVariant zip files we eventually get will be quite small. (The zip files are basically Python scripts and bytecode with a compiled shared library.). Regarding what's missing or incompatible during the build, we will let the compiler tell us that, which will make it a bit easier to troubleshoot. Just to be sure we minimize surprises, we will do a couple of things first. To ensure the TensorFlow code we will compile against is of the same version as the TensorFlow python package (2.11.0), run the following in your `git clone` TensorFlow folder (the assumption is that your TensorFlow folder is outside your DeepVariant one):. ```; # Assuming you are in the DeepVariant directory. cd ../tensorflow; git checkout origin/r2.11 -f. # Here configure like before with the defaults; ./configure. cd ../deepvariant; ```. Once in the DeepVariant directory, perform each of these separately so we can isolate any issues:. ```; #!/bin/bash; source settings.sh. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/deepvariant/r1.5/.bazelrc. bazel build -c opt ${DV_COPT_FLAGS} --build_python_zip :binaries; ```. You may notice that we removed `.bazelrc` previously, that was so that we can ensure while we troubleshoot the `bazel` installation nothing gets triggered by the `.bazelrc` config. The last two things you have to run to complete the DeepVariant build are the following, though the above should give most of what you need:. ```; #!/bin/bash; source settings.sh. bazel build -c opt ${DV_COPT_FLAGS} --build_python_zip //deepvariant/labeler:labeled_examples_to_vcf; ```. ```; #!/bin/bash; source settings.sh. bazel build -c opt ${DV_COPT_FLAGS} --build_python_zip :binaries-deeptrio; ```. Your zip files will be under the `bazel-bin/deepvariant/`. The `zip` files will require some patching, ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/657#issuecomment-1581784104:1160,config,configure,1160,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/657#issuecomment-1581784104,1,['config'],['configure']

The DeepTrio manuscript has benchmarks for this strategy in the following section (near the end of results):. > The Genome in a Bottle truth sets do not contain chromosomeX or chromosomeY variants in a; > male individual. As a result, DeepTrio has never been trained with hemizygous sites. Because we; > train DeepTrio to perform duo calling, it is likely that DeepTrio would call variants on; > chromosomeX similar to how it would call a duo sample. To assess this, we ran DeepVariant and; > DeepTrio on chromosomeX of the son (HG002) and measured the number of heterozygous; > variant calls in the non-PAR regions of chromosomeX.; > ; > For DeepVariant, 4.45% (455/101866) of calls in non-PAR regions of chromosomeX are; > heterozygous. In DeepTrio, 24.5% (21633/88314) are heterozygous. This substantial difference; > suggests that applying DeepTrio directly to chromosomeX in male samples is problematic.; > Since chromosomeX in males is inherited from the mother, we performed calling on; > chromosomeX with only the mother provided as the parent.

Modifiability,"at might expose one type of a genotype or another with confidence. Imagine that instead of dividing by 10, I find the values (matrices) that best helps separate the data in a BAM file I know should have specific variants at specific loci. I want to maximize that precision to be able to recall. Now you notice that the original data and transformations (feature maps) are linked preserving this $`propagation`$ $`of`$ $`information`$, as this flow of information is enabled through these sets of transformations. An interesting thing then begins to emerge as you move up the layers of transformation. For example, early on in the neural network's set of transformations you will see patterns like this:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/bc3cff8b-efa8-4029-abbe-75ad06973d24). You might notice an explosion of features, with no specific patterns. These early steps are to generate a large variety of features to be able to have selection power for the later layers to use as input, for helping with the separation into distinct patterns for mapping to the different classes of genotypes confidently. For example, you can see distinct patterns forming as it reaches the later stages: . ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/9f69f9dc-8dec-4370-aa69-e0295265e7f0). ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/83edefd6-8d77-4a7a-8fb3-921ec7c3cff1).

Modifiability,"ay from this is not that there are options, but how these options internally work to infer the genotype and its probability given the data. Some work better with longer reads, and some with shorter reads. You want to play with them to get a feel of what is happening given different data. If you are curious, you can read the papers and mathematics behind each approach, and you'll be surprised by their similarity in approaches of inferring the call and its probability (quality). I have included a list of papers with links in the reference section below. Now if the above is too easy, and you want to make _de novo_ variant calling more exciting, you can use the `glnexus` with the config `--config DeepVariant_unfiltered`, which is basically the following [Yaml config file](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.5/deepvariant/cohort_best_practice/DeepVariant_unfiltered_v1.yml) indicating to GLnexus to operate [under specific parameters conditions](https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/GLnexus/wiki/Configuration). So when you perform GLnexus joint variant calling, you will get the three sample columns (father/mother/child) in your joint VCF. To determine a _de novo_ call, you just look for genotypes that would not follow Mendelian inheritance, such as `0/0 0/0 0/1`, such as:. ```; chr7 54624683 chr7_54624683_A_AATC A AATC 27 .

Modifiability,"d to replicate this issue, and here is what I found. I created an instance from [this CentOS7 VM](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/centos-cloud/centos-7). I chose the default location for all installations. When asked if I wanted to update my PATH during installations, I chose to do so. I was able to install DeepVariant through Bioconda using the below steps. . I ran into a particular error with `gsutil`. After running `source ~/.bashrc`, I saw an error when I ran `gsutil`. `gsutil` is used by the DeepVariant installation, so that failed as well. To address this, I referenced [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38783140/importerror-no-module-named-google-compute-engine) and ran `export BOTO_CONFIG=/dev/null` before installing DeepVariant again. Running these commands in order allows me to successfully install on the VM. ```; # install gsutil; curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash; exec -l $SHELL; # verify that gsutil is working; gsutil. # install wget and bzip2, which are both needed to download miniconda; sudo yum install bzip2 wget; wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh; bash Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh ; source ~/.bashrc. # gsutil is failing now; gsutil; export BOTO_CONFIG=/dev/null; # gsutil should be working again; gsutil. # create new conda env, add channels, install deepvaraint; conda create -n dv python=2.7; conda activate dv; conda config --add channels defaults; conda config --add channels bioconda; conda config --add channels conda-forge; conda install -n dv deepvariant -v; ```. In the output from running `conda install -n dv deepvariant -v`, I see the first error you posted even with a successful installation. I was not able to replicate the second error. Some sanity checks for you:. * Are you able to successfully run `gsutil`?; * Did you add all conda channels in the correct order?; * Could you post the entire output from running `conda install -v deepvariant`?.

Modifiability,"d, and has a very practical use-case for many users that would like to automate their analysis. I'm sort of hinting at something else. So just imagine you are pitching this to some Bioinformatician that has been doing their analysis on an internal cluster for years. S/he has heard from others of the benefits of DeepVariant through Google Cloud resources, and now has a little bit of free time to try it out to convince their boss to use it. The idea is that the root directory should be as simple as possible, so users don't get overwhelmed or confused - with all the other directories in the tree flowing naturally from it. A minimal number of obvious scripts (with associated documentation) should naturally transition them from source code, through the build phase, and as quickly to the analysis process. Basically less is more, and you do not want to add more to the main directory as you begin to approach version 1.0. So ideally what would be nice is to have one build script - let's call it `build` - that reads a `config/build` directory - and does the following:. 1. Analyzes hidden build-generated files under `.build/...`, and detects if the `prereq` and `build-and-test` phases have been successfully processed. Otherwise, it would report back to the user the build status, and query the user with a recommendation on the next required step to run. For example:. ```; $ build status. Checking DeepVariant build prerequisites... OK; Checking DeepVariant test environment compatibility [GPU]... OK; Checking DeepVariant build binaries... MISSING. Proceed with building binaries [Y/n]?. ```. 2. Once the builds have been successfully completed, then it would tell the user the available options to run (i.e. `make_examples`, `call_variants`, `postprocess_variants`, `pkrusche/hap.py`, etc.) as well as any analysis that has been completed if a `results` or `analysis-results` folder is present. 3. For Cloud Build, that would also be part of the `build` script, when they provide the `help",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/87#issuecomment-413745335:1075,config,config,1075,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/87#issuecomment-413745335,1,['config'],['config']

Modifiability,"e hom_ref classifications are much less reliable than hom_alt and het classes. My question is whether this is to be expected, or whether there might be something wrong with my training setup, or perhaps the examples. . The test example set I am using to tune the hyperparams looks like this:. ```; # Generated by shuffle_tfrecords_beam.py; # class2: 89987; # class0: 33161; # class1: 24300. name: ""Shuffle_global""; tfrecord_path: ""/home/examples_shuffled/train/shuf_test/examples_shuf3_testset.shuffled-?????-of-?????.tfrecord.gz""; num_examples: 147448; ```. The training command looks like this:. ```; LR=0.001; BS=1024. apptainer run \; --nv \; -B $WD:/home \; $DV_PATH \; /opt/deepvariant/bin/train \; --config=/home/dv_config.py:base \; --config.train_dataset_pbtxt=""/home/examples_shuffled/train/shuf_test/examples_shuf3_testset_config.pbtxt"" \; --config.tune_dataset_pbtxt=""/home/examples_shuffled/tune_test/tune_test_examples_config.pbtxt"" \; --config.num_epochs=1 \; --config.learning_rate=${LR} \; --config.num_validation_examples=0 \; --config.tune_every_steps=2000 \; --experiment_dir=/home/${OUTDIR} \; --strategy=mirrored \; --config.batch_size=${BS} \; --config.init_checkpoint=""/home/model_wgs_v1.6.1/deepvariant.wgs.ckpt""; ```. During other tests I have run training jobs with several other example sets (several times larger), for tens of thousands of steps and multiple epochs, and also using different learning rates and batch sizes. While these things of course make a difference to learning performance, the lower recall for class 0 (hom_ref) remains consistent. . Here are some lines from the log file during one such training run:. ```; I1031 10:55:27.365902 140558597089024 logging_writer.py:48] [0] epoch=0, train/categorical_accuracy=0.91796875, train/categorical_crossentropy=0.6384725570678711, train/f1_het=0.7428571581840515, train/f1_homalt=0.964401364326477, train/f1_homref=0.902255654335022, train/f1_macro=0.; 8698380589485168, train/f1_micro=0.91796875, train/f1_w",MatchSource.ISSUE,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/904:1364,config,config,1364,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/904,1,['config'],['config']

Modifiability,"e more of an ensemble model approach in the future, where you you want to push your data through multiple pipelines for comparison. At that point you're not even writing code anymore, but rather directing transformation among (ephemeral) datasets through an intermediate analysis language ([DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)) to try out different ideas upon a collection of data -- where some might contain/become golden standards. For example, now you have collections of transformed datasets streamlined as protobuf message, which can be filter-inspected as JSON as necessary for validation purposes, which you can do now such as for `CallVariantsOutput` among others:. ```; variant {; reference_bases: ""A""; alternate_bases: ""C""; calls {; info {; key: ""AD""; ...; call_set_name: ""Sample_Diag-excap51-HG002-EEogPU""; }; end: 1115835; reference_name: ""1""; start: 1115834; ...; ```. So what I'm humbly proposing is something more subtle and flexible. Imagine you open a genome browser, and search for a specific disease. It then can have you drill down to the available samples or the variation graph. For the variation graph it will allow you to see a model of transitions among samples relating the temporal behavior of subtypes of cancer. All these steps are multiple pipelines that are auto-triggered to run accordingly, or would be pre-cached results. As new samples come in, it improves the disease models, or other functional analysis. This opens doors to Personlized Medicine -- clinicians, research, or patients -- enabling integrated analysis that is centralized for different types of datasets. You already have the protobuf data-structures for initiating that, thus allowing your stored collection of pipelines to drive that integration and comparison to take place, of which DeepVariant would be one of many. Thus flexibility in the form of modularity when refactoring the codebase will allow for more fluid hierarchical analysis to take place down the line.

Modifiability,"enetic clusters forming stemming from the ancestor population. So if the mutations are more localized and are still diploid, that means it would not behave in the way true germline diploid genomes would transfer their genotypes. This means you would have more alterations -- that might be real, or stem from sub-populations of clonal events affecting your sample purity -- and thus you cannot rely on ploidy to support your allele frequency (as illustrated by your plot above). This is of course assuming artifacts of sequencer errors, and others are removed. So instead you would need to do something like ""panel of clonals"" to compare against, to compare between clonal events. Then among these you would denoise for the common variants, so you can construct a phylogenetic analysis how the mutations evolve. All these alterations you would need to validate through your reads supported by multiple replicates. Though you are fighting your clonal events here, and would need to validate that the coverage of the labeled events (samples) in your cohort study are individually relatively consistent in the specific variant distribution (i.e. you want no/minimal heterogeneity of samples contaminating each individual labeled sample). This way your samples are comparable. Based on the above, hope it makes sense why the `./.` and `0/0` make sense to analyze. Given that you cannot rely on the ploidy for your allele frequency, this can also be illustrated by the diversity in allele frequency, instead of unique clusters you would normally observe in a true germline variant. Given that, there probably is heterogeneity in the sample purity of variants, which would lead to a spread of the VAF. Now you need to isolate the variants and determine their inheritance, validated by large coverage to ensure they are true variants. This will provide you the drivers of the mutations and transmissions -- some of which might be more stable than others given different selection forces. Hope it helps,; Paul",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/682#issuecomment-1650246876:1994,inherit,inheritance,1994,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/682#issuecomment-1650246876,1,['inherit'],['inheritance']

Modifiability,"et me try to unpack them. -- There are some engineering constraints in DeepVariant that assume we train only 3 classes. One example is https://github.com/google/deepvariant/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=DEFAULT_NUM_CLASSES&type= but there may be others. If you want to change the number of classes you'll need to track these down and generalize them. If you do that please send us a CL and we'll make sure to incorporate the changes into the master codebase here. Once you do that it should be possible to train as with as many labels as you like. -- You'll need to write your own labeler algorithm to provide a label for each training variant. These classes are in deepvariant/labeler. There are two (a PositionalLabeler and a HaplotypeLabeler) so you can use these as templates to hook up your own labeling algorithm. At the core these just need to return an integer label (0 ... N) for each example. Once you get that going it should be simple to label your own examples. Technically the labels can be anything. For example, if you emitted the reference base value as 0 for A, 1 for T, etc I'm pretty sure the machinery can learn to call the reference base from the image with perfect accuracy. -- The machinery of training really doesn't know anything about NGS data. It just takes the examples and tries to learn to predict the label. Once you get your labels in and the machinery doesn't expect just 3 it should be possible to train anything you want. You can use standard evaluation machinery to decide if your DeepVariant training run is successfully learning something. -- You'll likely need to write your own version of postprocess_variants (or extend it in some way) to bridge from the predicted labels and the information you want to export in the VCF (or other file format). In germline DeepVariant we learn to predict 0, 1, and 2 which mean hom-ref, het, and hom-alt, respectively, which is encoded in postprocess_variants. You'll need your own equivalent to this code.

Modifiability,"gle/deepvariant/issues/185 . The advice in my comment https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/185#issuecomment-494919509 has a code change that you could try out, only if you want to experiment with different warmstarting logic on your own. . What we currently use is what you can find in our r0.10 codebase:; https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/4b937f03a1336d1dc6fd4c0eef727e1f83d2152a/deepvariant/modeling.py#L560. When warmstarting and training with a small(er) amount of data, it's always possible that the curve might look a bit weird at the beginning. Here is a rule of thumb I use: a stable training setup should be mostly reproducible. Meaning, if you run the same training multiple times, the curves should eventually converge to about the same place, and shouldn't behave drastically different. They won't look the exactly same because of randomness in training process. But if half of the runs don't converge, or behave very differently from the other half, then something needs to be improved. You might also have a question on whether you need to warmstart. That is an empirical question. Here is an example from my experience:; For our PacBio training, at this point I actually feel like we have enough data to not have to warmstart from the WGS model. But we're still warmstarting (at least for now) because I find that it converges faster and the resulting accuracy is about the same. We make these decisions based on empirical evidence and our intuition on ML and the data. These decisions can also evolve over time. ( Btw, one thing that we might not have documented - if you want to try with *not* warmstarting from anything, and want to just randomly init, you can set `--start_from_checkpoint=""""`. ). I think your setup above looks reasonable to me. If you want to share more later (like what your training looks like, how long it takes to converge, whether your new model works better on your data, etc), feel free to add more in this issue. I will close it for now.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/312#issuecomment-638521636:1834,evolve,evolve,1834,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/312#issuecomment-638521636,1,['evolve'],['evolve']

Modifiability,"hi, I am using DV 0.9 to find *de novo* variants in trios and so I am enriching for weird stuff. ; I am sure your team is aware of some/all of these, but I'll document at least 1 case here for the record. Nearly all obvious false positive de novo calls follow the same pattern. Mostly there is a haplotype from mom , and a haplotype from dad that are different. The kid inherits both the variable haplotypes, but the combination of DV and glnexus gentoype such that the variant appears as de novo. But, here is an example where there is just an incorrect call from DV that leads to 3 neighboring spurious de novo calls in the kid (top row):; ![bad-dn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1739/74561469-d68a6600-4f25-11ea-8c71-105596810ace.png). note that dad in the 3rd row has a single read with a 1-base deletion (dash) followed by an insertion (purple tick). I can't show all of the reads in this image, but I have scrolled through and verified that is the only read. . here is the content of the dad's VCF for that region (the mom's is actually very similar):; ```; chr8	75144980	.

Modifiability,"hink the average read length is 48,060 based on [this publication](; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9205427/pdf/main.pdf).

So that the proper SNP Pepper model gets selected internally, you can use the `--ont_r9_guppy4_hac` argument with `run_pepper_margin_deepvariant call_variants`, though not sure [version r0.8](https://hub.docker.com/layers/kishwars/pepper_deepvariant/r0.8/images/sha256-70908591ad67e8567a6e4551119b2cfc33d957ad39701c8af51b36b516214645?context=explore) has the Guppy 4 model.

Ideally maybe you can get the FAST5 files from the [following Amazon S3 page](https://registry.opendata.aws/ont-open-data/) and reprocess them with Guppy 5 $`-`$ as that's the latest version that the Pepper model seems to be trained against $`-`$ so that you can then utilize the `--ont_r9_guppy5_sup` parameter with the [r0.8 container](https://hub.docker.com/layers/kishwars/pepper_deepvariant/r0.8/images/sha256-70908591ad67e8567a6e4551119b2cfc33d957ad39701c8af51b36b516214645?context=explore), or [version r0.5 of the Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/layers/kishwars/pepper_deepvariant/r0.5/images/sha256-13906107b84849590400074e84ce12aba051447a8118c84f31f2b20540fbd807?context=explore).

Modifiability,"iables in the TRAINABLE_VARIABLES collection -- if you need to warm-start non_TRAINABLE vars (such as optimizer accumulators or batch norm statistics), please use the below option.; ```; Because in our code, we use a regular expression like this:; https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/aff131aac3bd0cb63ee8314e32bcbf5590987fb8/deepvariant/modeling.py#L361. This means that only the variables in the TRAINABLE_VARIABLES get loaded when we warm start.; This explains why warm starting from a checkpoint does not produce the same (or even similar) results as the inference/prediction mode. For example, Batch norms were not being warmstarted. If you do want to load **everything**, one trick we've tried is to change to code into a list:; ```; vars_to_warm_start=['|'.join(vars_to_include)]); ```; which then tricks the code into the model of loading everything (not just TRAINABLE_VARIABLES). But, it doesn't seem very desirable because it also loads things like global_step. The best way is probably to include just BatchNorm and the Trainable variables we want, but it'll require more refactoring here. If try with the small code change above and observe the log -- you'll see that a lot more vars are being used in warm-starting now. (But note that you'll likely want to exclude some variables such as global_step, because those will affect your learning rate). Note that even when warmstarting from an existing checkpoint, we don't currently recommend ""fine-tuning"" with very few steps. Even with our small TPU training case study, we showed an example to train up to 50k steps before we pick a model.; So if you want to use our code to fine tune on your data, please proceed with caution and make sure you carefully benchmark the accuracy and robustness of the resulting model. .

While that gives me other options to test to decrease run-time, it sounds like I should point out that these are two cloud comparisons (*not* being run on my local machine - that was only GATK). It also looks like I used an earlier version of one of the tutorials (not exactly what is provided in the Exome case study). So, I apologize for the confusion. **1b)** I think my answer is in *1a)* above.

If I generate a t-SNE plot of this, I see something like the following using colors to denote the different channels (feature maps):. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/20c87e1a-e87f-4b7d-b14d-a7f4d6bfbfef). Now comes the fun part! Let's have different matrices (like the ones that generated the new channels above) that will identify interesting features that might expose one type of a genotype or another with confidence. Imagine that instead of dividing by 10, I find the values (matrices) that best helps separate the data in a BAM file I know should have specific variants at specific loci. I want to maximize that precision to be able to recall. Now you notice that the original data and transformations (feature maps) are linked preserving this $`propagation`$ $`of`$ $`information`$, as this flow of information is enabled through these sets of transformations. An interesting thing then begins to emerge as you move up the layers of transformation. For example, early on in the neural network's set of transformations you will see patterns like this:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/bc3cff8b-efa8-4029-abbe-75ad06973d24). You might notice an explosion of features, with no specific patterns. These early steps are to generate a large variety of features to be able to have selection power for the later layers to use as input, for helping with the separation into distinct patterns for mapping to the different classes of genotypes confidently. For example, you can see distinct patterns forming as it reaches the later stages: . ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/9f69f9dc-8dec-4370-aa69-e0295265e7f0). ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/83edefd6-8d77-4a7a-8fb3-921ec7c3cff1). Once the pattern has been achieved like the following, then one can proceed with testing each genotype's representation of the variant:. ![im",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/666#issuecomment-1612282088:3370,layers,layers,3370,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/666#issuecomment-1612282088,1,['layers'],['layers']

Modifiability,"ither DeepVariant or Clair3 -- have semi-fixed input assumptions. Sure they have been trained with some flexibility in the input data to capture some variability, but not to the extent that they will adapt to significant allele, or possible structural variation. I mean think of a convolutional neural network like this simplified example:. $`y\_output = weights_\gamma \cdot ( (weights_\alpha \cdot input + bias_\alpha) + (weights_\beta \cdot input + bias_\beta) ) + bias_\gamma`$. This is a simple regression (linear model). If you adjust the weights and bias terms for produce specific output given the input, and then you modify the inputs significantly and hope to get the same results, it will naturally fail. The same with DeepVariant and Clair3, they are bounded and determined by their weights and biases. These deep learning models were meant to work at scale under relatively normal data conditions (data conditions they were trained and validated for). The way to adjust for variable datasets is to create an ensemble model. What that means is that you have a model for each subtype of your organism. Then your run your data across all models to see which ones respond with high confidence. In your case, you don't have that and have to adjust for the data you have; as training a new model would require a confident variant truth set. So what is the known starting point is the biology of your organism. To control for variability, the first step is probably to ensure you have good isolates of your organism that you can get sequence data from -- you've seen that in your case it was multiallelic so it probably is not a pure isolate. You probably don't need to arrest them if you validate for known markers and sequenced at the same time to ensure they do not modify. These replicates would form your panels. Then there is probably a whole slew of analysis, and experiments you would need to understand these variants. Part of that can be to see how you can confidence-label the varian",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,google,deepvariant,v1.6.1,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/682#issuecomment-1650719832:2693,variab,variable,2693,,https://github.com/google/deepvariant/issues/682#issuecomment-1650719832,1,['variab'],['variable']
Modifiability,"ithub.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.1/docs/deepvariant-quick-start.md. For the main DeepVariant command, I ran:. ```; sudo docker run \; -v ""${INPUT_DIR}"":""/input"" \; -v ""${OUTPUT_DIR}"":""/output"" \; google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}"" \; /opt/deepvariant/bin/run_deepvariant \; --model_type=WGS \; --ref=/input/ucsc.hg19.chr20.unittest.fasta \; --reads=/input/NA12878_S1.chr20.10_10p1mb.bam \; --regions ""chr20:10,000,000-10,010,000"" \; --output_vcf=/output/output.vcf.gz \; --output_gvcf=/output/output.g.vcf.gz \; --intermediate_results_dir /output/intermediate_results_dir \; --num_shards=1 \; --call_variants_extra_args=""use_openvino=true"" \; 2>&1 | tee /tmp/deepvariant.log; ```. With this run above, all steps (including call_variants) completed without errors. After that run, I repeated the call_variants step:; ```; sudo docker run \; -v ""${INPUT_DIR}"":""/input"" \; -v ""${OUTPUT_DIR}"":""/output"" \; google/deepvariant:""${BIN_VERSION}"" \; /opt/deepvariant/bin/call_variants \; --outfile ""/output/intermediate_results_dir/call_variants_output.tfrecord.gz"" \; --examples ""/output/intermediate_results_dir/make_examples.tfrecord@1.gz"" \; --checkpoint ""/opt/models/wgs/model.ckpt"" \; --use_openvino; ```; which worked fine too. You mentioned you used DeepVariant1.1.0 version via Docker, but you also mentioned your command was:; `python /opt/DeepVariant-1.1.0/call_variants.zip --outfile ./call_variants_output.tfrecord.gz --examples ./examples.tfrecord@${N_SHARDS}.gz --checkpoint /opt/DeepVariant-1.1.0/models/DeepVariant-inception_v3-1.1.0+data-wes_standard/model.ckpt --use_openvino --num_readers 32`. Can you be more specific about how you run this command?. And, another pointer for you:; In our Dockerfile, we set these environment variables:; https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.1/Dockerfile#L156-L157. You should probably first check whether those directories exist in your environment. And if they do exist, you'll need to set those environment variables too.

Modifiability,"k we are in perfect agreement. Supporting what the community wants is my preferred approach as well. I was only suggesting it after having performed a reduction upon the functional set of DeepVariant's design. Just in case the community requires more variety of labeled inputs, having a parameter processor might help in mapping between DeepVariant's core operation and different parameter sets. This would create flexibility for both the goals of the design team and community. For example, the design team might want flexibility in playing around with different transformations of read signals and parameter search spaces - which might change over time or with different data sets - without worrying that the parameter list might require updating. Let's take the following simplified model optimization:. ![image](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/assets/6555937/f7c33960-59fc-45c9-9cdd-0f015ebd1aae). The team would let this model optimize itself to determine the parameter set under which it performs ideally. Then metadata about the training would be saved along with the optimized model. Then users can query the model's metadata via some program, which would provide information about the training data and parameters limits for different model types. Such metadata would be automatically populated through the model training step (where I'm including the validation and tuning steps). Based on that, a default set of parameters can be auto-generated for general users, and advanced users can then map their custom parameters however they want. It basically makes the training turn-key and usage automatic. Such training could even be remotely initiated through a browser, and different users can make some of their models available to others if they want, thus helping out the community and growing it at the same time. This would also make adapting new models much faster, including where a large set of specialized ensemble models might be required to check against.
