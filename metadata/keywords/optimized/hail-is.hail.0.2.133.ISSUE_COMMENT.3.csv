Modifiability,"I think we should have the following design that runs the benchmarks in k8s because then we are using google's internal network to transmit data (compared to running on my local computer via a cloud proxy):. - Have a `db-benchmark` namespace in k8s specifically for this. 1. create_db.py; a. This will take the parameters needed for `gcloud sql instances create` including database flags, disk space, cores, etc. and create an instance; b. Get the IP address of the instance (hopefully the REST API works for this); c. Create a database; d. Create user and password for the database; e. Create config file; f. Create secret in the db-benchmark namespace from the config file; ; 2. run.py; a. Build the docker image with the benchmark.py code and installs aiomysql, etc.; b. Create pod which mounts the correct secret with the sql config for the instance to use. Environment variables specify the n_replicates, etc. Print out the pod name.; c. Wait for the pod to complete (you have code in CI that does this); d. Download logs; e. Delete the pod. 3. cleanup.py; a. Delete mysql instance; b. Delete kubernetes secret in db-benchmark namespace. Thoughts? . I tried to think about how to use the current build system and what I would do is add a new CreateSQLInstance step, CreateDatabase takes the instance name and IP address as a parameter, and have CI take a path to the build.yaml file to build from.

I agree that move semantics takes getting used to, but I think it is much too integrated into modern C++ to ignore, going far beyond unique_ptr. Writing interfaces that take advantage of move semantics requires understanding rvalue-references in more detail, but for users of those move-enabled interfaces I think the guidelines are easy to teach: a variable will only be modified by moving if it is explicitly tagged with a `std::move`, so all you have to remember is ""after a `std::move(foo)`, the variable `foo` may only be assigned to or deleted."". > And then you get into a whole host of associated design decisions (I'm holding this as a unique_ptr,; but I want to pass it to a function - should I pass it as a raw pointer ? a raw reference ? a reference; to the unique_ptr ?). Keeping in mind the model that letting a function/class `foo` hold a `unique_ptr<Widget>` means explicitly ""`foo` owns this Widget, and is responsible for deleting it or passing ownership somewhere else"", these questions have pretty clear answers. * If a function `bar` takes a `Widget` but isn't concerned with its lifetime management, it should take its argument as a `Widget*` or `Widget&`, with the usual reasoning to choose between them. The caller owns the widget, and the lifetime of `bar` is nested inside that of its caller, so lifetime management isn't an issue.; * If `bar` takes a `Widget` and needs to take ownership, it should take its argument as a `unique_ptr<Widget>`. This serves as documentation that the function is taking over responsibility for deleting the Widget, in a way enforced by the compiler.; * A `unique_ptr<Wid",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3718#issuecomment-396669638:724,variab,variable,724,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3718#issuecomment-396669638,2,['variab'],['variable']
Modifiability,"I wanted to chime in on this briefly because I think it a good example use case and its design will influence many future methods, so it is important to get the design right. Thoughts:. - the underscore stuff is a non-starter in my opinion, and too clever by half.

You'd never want to write this _ stuff if you didn't have to. - I'm still not quite sure what tablify does (in part because the name is too clever by half and in part because it doesn't appear to always return tables). - But I think the idea of tablify is something we want, which is to convert (possibly indexed expressions) back into relational objects (Table, MatrixTable) because the latter support a wider set of operations and don't have the ""source mismatch problem"". Tim and I discussed this yesterday and we suggest the following interface:. ```; t = build_table(); .set_globals(x = 5, batch = batch); .set_rows(locus = locus, aaf = aaf); .build(); ```. and. ```; mt = build_table_matix(); .set_globals(dataset = dataset); .set_rows(locus = locus, aaf = aaf); .set_entries(GT = GT); .build(); ```. where the input expressions for each part must all come from the same source (or be compatible, e.g., constants) and the resulting (matrix) table inherits the keys from the original table.

Modifiability,I'm getting ~13 changes when I `terraform plan` now. Most are related to terraform wanting to replace the network because `auto_create_subnetworks` is false and it wants it to be true. It's also complaining about no `name` label on `hail_test_requester_pays_bucket` and it is not currently aware of `zulip_config` and wants to recreate it.

The latter would be best documented with scripts that regenerate the secrets from some root secret. We can [programmatically generate oauth tokens](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth_authorizations/) (which are different from personal access tokens) with username and password authentication. A recreation script could use one privileged key that has access to username/password for each hail test user. That is used to generate auth-tokens (we might need to adapt our code to use oauth tokens instead of personal access tokens). GCP service account keys can be generated programmatically.

Modifiability,"In particular, isn't it possible that you have the n-1th and nth job racing to complete. Everyone else is already done. Call the n-1th job's transaction T1 and the nth job's transaction T2. Both race down to this statement in MJC:; ```; UPDATE batches; SET time_completed = new_timestamp,; `state` = 'complete'; WHERE id = in_batch_id AND n_completed = batches.n_jobs;; ```. That will now need to have a sum(n_completed) over all tokens. The isolation level is repeatable read. Assume T1 and T2 generate non equal tokens. T1 and T2 may both snapshot the state of the database before either T1 or T2 executes. T1 and T2 will necessarily see the changes they've made (which affect distinct rows because they have distinct tokens), but neither is required to see the changes the other has made. I think the only way to guarantee that at least one of T1 or T2 sees the database with sum(n_completed) == n_jobs is for both of them to LOCK IN SHARE MODE when doing the sum(n_completed). That will cause lock contention. Maybe that's OK? In the worst case you could have this happen:. 1. Job 1 executes all the way to just before the sum(n_completed).; 2. Job 2 executes all the way to modifying the volatile state.; 3. Job 1 blocks waiting for Job 2 to modify the volatile state.; 4. Job 3 executes all the way to modifying the volatile state.; 5. Job 1 and 2 now wait for Job 3 to modifying the volatile state.; 6. ...; 7. Job 1, 2, 3, n-1 now all wait for Job n to modify the volatile state.; 8. Job 1...n finally execute the sum, all in parallel.

Within the new trigger, if the attempt has not been aggregated yet, then we use `NEW.end - NEW.start` as the time to aggregate with. If the attempt has been aggregated, then we use the original way which is just to take the difference between New and Old. At the end, we find all attempts that have not been aggregated (not in the new table that keeps track of whether an attempt has been aggregated) and update the dummy variable to run the trigger.

Modifiability,"Just saw this. > adds job.entrypoint method. I'm going to argue against this. The goal is not to make Batch a Docker wrapper, in fact, maybe that's an anti-goal. The goal is to build on docker (and other container tools) to create a natural interface for the problems Batch is trying to solve. The expectation is that the commands to be executed will be specified as part of the Job. In particular, I think if you don't specify the command, the command set is empty and no commands get run. It doesn't default to the docker command by default when no command is specified. So I would solve this by just always invoking the image with `--entrypoint <shell>`. > Long term, I think it would be better to use docker engine for LocalBackend, so that container config/create/start between ServiceBackend and LocalBackend could have a common interface.

Modifiability,"Now, as in, after this change, or now as in generally?. MatrixRead is now a parameterized IR. It has three public parameters: it has a requested type (typ) and it can drop the rows or columns. It also has a reader that produces a matrix value based on those parameters. There are currently two readers: MatrixRangeReader and MatrixNativeReader (reading a .mt file). MatrixIR.{read, range} produce these MatrixRead nodes from suitable inputs. I didn't follow this in Python, so Python has MatrixRead (corresponding to reading a .mt) and MatrixRange, which have the ""suitable"" inputs and the parser calls MatrixIR.{read, range} when parsing them. Although TableRead isn't organized this way, I did add a TableIR.read. The problem here is that MatrixNativeReader has the spec that comes from reading the metadata, so either I need to (1) open and read the metadata in Python (duplicating the metadata parsing logic), (2) call into Scala to read the metadata, but then re-encode it when I serialize the IR node, or (3) don't include the spec in the serialized form and let Scala read the metadata when parsing.

Modifiability,"OK, I've made most of the changes and I'd appreciate some feedback before I finalize the PR. Notable changes:; - The `hailctl dataproc` subcommand now has `--beta`, `--configuration=`, `--dry-run`, `--project=` and `--zone=`. These apply to all commands. There is a `GcloudRunner` object that takes these options, is set to the click context user `obj` field, and is used by all hailctl dataproc commands to invoke gcloud. Note, not all dataproc subcommands invoke gcloud, but the current design doesn't differentiate. Note, with `click`, the subcommand options must go on the subcommand, so `hailctl dataproc stop --dry-run` is an error.; - hailctl no longer takes `--region` (for gcloud dataproc commands). I compute region in `GcloudRunner` by checking dataproc/region or falling back to determining the region from the zone. I error if the region and zone are incompatible (gcloud would also do this).; - I stripped all gcloud pass through args from `hailctl dataproc modify`. There aren't any left. Invoking `modify` now looks like:. ```; hailctl dataproc modify my-cluster \; --extra-glcoud-update-args='---num-workers=2 --num-secondary-workers=100'; ```. The `extra` in the option name sounds a little weird since they are the only options (and the command isn't run if they aren't specified), but I'm leaving it for consistency for now. I moved the help text from the removed options into the help for the modify command itself. The output of `modify --help` is included below.; - I plan to leave the `--async` option to stop, although it is pass through.; - Then there is `--files` for submit. This is passed through, but `--py-files` is needed (it is not passed through, but modified). Do I leave `--files`? I'm currently inclined to.; - Finally, I need to strip out the pass through arguments for start like I did with update. ```; $ hailctl dataproc modify --help; Usage: hailctl dataproc modify [OPTIONS] CLUSTER_NAME.

Modifiability,"OK, so the big insight is that ""InstanceConfig"" is really just ""ResourcesForAParticularInstance"" (well, and, sometimes, ""ResourcesOfARepresentativeInstance""). I trimmed the InstanceConfig down *significantly* removing the ""vm_config"". Now the InstanceConfig is cheap and easy to create and there's no circularity between vm_config and instance config. I pushed that through everywhere and then abstracted the common create_instance logic for pool and job-private into InstanceCollection. With both of those changes, I was able to modify the ResourceManager's API to expose methods for constructing instance configs. However, the instance config isn't critical to the operation of the ResourceManager. It's just an interface for communicating an instance's resources to the rest of the code base.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/10920#issuecomment-956500279:344,config,config,344,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/10920#issuecomment-956500279,3,['config'],"['config', 'configs']"

Modifiability,"Once we fold in cloud tools, the CI will only be testing hail-is/hail, so all these questions of coupling between CI and hail-is/hail are moot. (Currently, these changes will introduce a few broken object links to the cloud tools repo. Which is mostly untidy rather than bad in anyway.). I created `artifacts/index.html` to work around a GCS limitation. Serving a bucket directly doesn't generate an `ls -l` style index.html for directories. nginx and apache are happy to do this. There are two layers:. - ci's ""job"" information (a log and a directory of artifacts); - project-specific artifacts. I think the friction is caused by CI & batch lacking a way to express a DAG of jobs. We've hacked this on via background processes, but now the ci's ""job"" page doesn't neatly correspond to one process log. Cotton's proposed batch DAG (& CI's use of it) resolves this by restoring the separation of ""job"" (or, now, ""jobs"") information and artifacts (which are truly just artifacts). All that said, if this makes your life easier, I don't mind the mild ugliness on cloud tools while we wait for batch DAG to land.

This is necessary because you can't override a block in a included file from the file that includes it.

Modifiability,"So I'm going to insist on the classical loop interface I described above, since it is strictly more powerful than the interfaces you've proposed. I don't have a strong feeling if you want to also add a Python-inspired while loop (although I personally would find the similarities misleading given the required differences, I understand others might feel differently). Your while loop should be naturally implementable in terms of mine, so I also suggest we focus on that first. Giving each loop a name seems natural. Apart from the wrapping issue (the greatest existential threat our generation faces) I don't see any problem calling an outer loop from an inner loop. Is Patrick's proposal for extra types written up anywhere? I don't like the idea of complicating the type hierarchy for internal bookkeeping like this. So I'm going to remark that in the code generator it is often natural to build data structures to aid the organization of the code generator, and those data structures need not need to be types/IRs. Given that Recur has to be in tail position, and you know exactly when you're existing the loop (branches that don't contain recur nodes). So the compilation looks like:. ```; set initial loop variables; # fall through into loop; Lloop:; ...; # recur; loop variables = new values; goto Lloop; Lan_exit_branch:; result = compile(branch); goto Lafter; Lanother_exit_branch:; result = compile(other_branch); goto Lafter; Lafter:; use result ...; ```. What I would do is ""peel"" off the ifs and lets (anything else?) that can sit in tail position and build a separate data structure for those nodes which I then traverse to emit the above code. Using the stream interface seems wrong to me also. What's the type of the stream the loop turns into? Since loops carry multiple values (by design), memory allocating these to create a tuple stream is going to be a performance non-starter. I'll comment more once I've looked over the code.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7614#issuecomment-558699125:1212,variab,variables,1212,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7614#issuecomment-558699125,2,['variab'],['variables']

We're looking forward to the functionality in this PR particularly because we're hoping that it'll allow us to schedule workers in the US, while our Batch deployment is in Australia.

For processing gnomAD data (which is located in the US), spinning up workers colocated with the data would be fantastic though. Hence we'd really need a configurable default value on the deployment level, I believe:. - Generally allow scheduling in AU + US regions (specifically `australia-southeast1` and `us-central1`).; - By default, pick any region in AU only (in practice `australia-southeast1`).; - Allow jobs to explicitly specify to run in the US (in practice `us-central1`).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12221#issuecomment-1275427218:82,config,configuration,82,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12221#issuecomment-1275427218,3,['config'],"['configurable', 'configuration']"

I think those should maybe just be 'file'? I could be convinced it should support empty string and 'file' as inputs if you want it to work on empty string. For LocalFS and GoogleCloudStorageFS, an empty scheme will correspond to a path to a local file. For HadoopFS, an empty scheme causes Hadoop to use its configured default file system. When running Hail locally, this would be the local file system. On a Dataproc cluster, this would be HDFS.

Modifiability,"Thanks for the explanation! I'm happy to make the change, I was just trying to understand the difference between Host and X-Forwarded-Host a little better before first. So if I understand correctly, for the different headers:; - X-Forwarded-Proto gets passed to the router through the base https server in gateway, which sets X-Forwarded-Proto to `$scheme`, which is always going to be https since that's always going to be the protocol you're using for that server? And so when we use `$updated_scheme` for the blog server in the router's config, it's going to look at `$http_x_forwarded_proto` which will always have been set to `https` from the gateway? I'm having trouble seeing when `$http_x_forwarded_proto` would ever be absent, although if it is, isn't $scheme always `http` since all traffic from gateway to router is via http? Or am I misunderstanding how this works?; - I'm having trouble understanding the difference between `Host` and `X-Forwarded-Host`, still. As I understand it, `Host` is the name of the server that the current request is trying to reach, and `X-Forwarded-Host` is the name of the server that the original request was trying to reach? Which is why `Host` is set to `$service.internal` and `X-Forwarded-Host` is `$http_host` in the internal.hail.is server? I don't quite follow your comment about our use of `Host` being wrong, in this case; I *think* I understand what you're saying? but I'm not sure why all of our stuff is setting `Host` to `$updated_host` if that's the case, and I don't understand what's happening enough to know what happens if I change it to `proxy_set_header Host $http_host;` instead.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7381#issuecomment-548078429:540,config,config,540,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7381#issuecomment-548078429,1,['config'],['config']

Modifiability,"The doc wasn't very clear about where information lived. I had imagined that the pools and the JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM) owned the information. Nit: the doc doesn't say the instance monitor monitors instances, it just monitors and handles *events*. Let me be explicit: I think the doc is wrong about the monitor doing health checking because that requires it to track the instances, which I just said should be owned by the pools and the JPIM. That didn't occur to me when we were writing the doc, my apologies. I still think the monitor should:; - route events to the right pool or to the JPIM, and; - aggregate summaries up for the web UI. ---. Let me try to be more specific in my critique:. I think of the system as three layers: the top most is the driver, the middle layer is the monitor, and the bottom layer is the pool or JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM). I don't want control flow to go down, up, and back down again. If that happens, then we can't reason about our system as separate layers, we necessarily have to think about the middle and bottom layer together. Very specifically, this flow worries me: (instance pool) create_instance -> (instance monitor) add_instance -> adjust_for_add_instance -> (instance pool) adjust_for_add_instance. We move from low to mid *back to low*. I want information to flow in one direction: either its downward information or its upward information. ---. I'm guessing you're also concerned about code organization / code duplication. I'm not that worried about this. The JPIM and the Pool are similar things and we might inevitably produce some duplication. That's OK with me. To be honest, I think a few stand-alone functions that both of them use will eliminate any code duplication. Both pools and the JPIM will have a `name_instances` and `instance_by_last_updated`. If the duplication gets hard to manage, we might pack that up into another class like InstanceCollection. I realize this means we have several monitoring loops.

If the Java backends can multiplex requests, HTTP sounds favorable, otherwise it's unclear to me what advantages it would give us over TCP + JSON.

Modifiability,"This is often the case when passing scripts to languages such as Perl, where extraneous backslashes inside the script can change its meaning or even be a syntax error. One simple way of handling this is to place the quoted string, or even the entire command, into a make variable then use the variable in the recipe. In this situation the newline quoting rules for makefiles will be used, and the backslash/newline will be removed.

Modifiability,"This is really great. . I have some thoughts below, mostly brain storming. Don't take any of it too seriously. Some thoughts:. 1. I thought you wanted to support f-strings. By making the batch file quote double curly parens, that means if you use them in an f-string, you need to write `f'{{{{foo}}}}'` which is a bit much. But that means that non-batch uses of `{}` need to be double-quoted, so `awk '{{ ... }}'` and `f""awk '{{{{ ... }}}}'""`. Hmm. Maybe using the same escape syntax as f-strings is not ideal. . I don't have a no-brainer suggestion. Happy to brainstorm ideas offline. I think ultimately this is a minor syntactic choice. 2. Inputs seem ... almost redundant, because they also appear in the command strings. What about:. ```; .command('shapeit --bed-file {{<subset.ofile}} --chr ' + contig + ' --out {{>ofile}}'); ```. Then the question becomes, how do associate `subset` with the corresponding Python variable? You could use the task label, but then the user has to maintain two sets of names, which isn't ideal. Hmm, maybe this doesn't work. 3. I like arrays of resources!. > `.command('cat {{files}} >> {{ofile}}')`. I wonder, will we ever want arrays to be formatted other than joined with spaces? I worry the user will want more flexibility in formatting, and we'll want that in Python. What about if the argument is a function, it takes a dictionary from resource names to their string representation, and you can format however you want? Then you could write the last command as:. ```; .command(lambda rs: f'cat {' '.join(rs['files'])} >> {rs['ofile']}'); ```. 4. I was confused by this:. > `p.write_output(merger.ofile + "".haps"", ...)`. What's the left hand side? Why isn't this just `merger.ofile`?. This suggests another issue: what if you want to use `ofile` in a plink command, but plink outputs some files with various extensions with `ofile` as the base?

Modifiability,"This is super cool! I am a big fan of the idea and the overall approach, particularly when it comes to setting up the tmp bucket and getting the permissions on it correct. Here's my high level thoughts. Sorry for the wall of text but I found these a little hard to articulate. ### Regarding number of prompts. I think this is my primary concern. There's a lot of great automation here, but it's a lot right off the bat. I think what this is aiming to do is make it quick and simple to start running batches and every time someone has to stop and ask someone a question as to how they should respond to some prompt that process gets longer and more complicated. I think it's worth considering what the first batch people should run might be and design for a minimal first experience. IMO, a temp bucket is an absolutely crucial piece of configuration before you can do anything interesting and configuring a temp bucket is something that `hailctl` can easily be very opinionated about. Container registry… I feel like there's harder questions there, and you can run a lot of cool batches before having to worry about provisioning your own. It's also not actually a part of the hailctl config (unless something has changed recently) so it feels a little unusual in this flow. I still think that it is helpful to set people up with an AR and keep them from footguns, but maybe that can go in a separate command that the initial init command points to once you're done? Something along the lines of ""if you get to the point where you need to upload custom container images, you can use hailctl to set up a registry""?. Another thing that gives me a little pause is the wording around google projects. I get that you need one to create a bucket, but I think we should just make sure to steer clear of the implication that you are ""selecting a GCP project to use for Hail Batch"", because that implies some link or ownership that isn't there.

And .sql files to create/clean up tables. When we want to run it, we can just clone the repo and run it directly. Then we can think about wrapping it in a larger test to spinning up database instances with various node and disk sizes and MySQL settings and see how they perform.; - You explore number of jobs and batch size, but I think you should also measure amount of batch insert parallelism.

Modifiability,"This isn't what I intended with my original design and I'm trying to figure out what you did here. - I intended for entire file, not individual specs, to have a version number. That's why it is in RelationalSpec at the top level.; - FooSpec (e.g. RelationalSpec, RVDSpec, etc.) is supposed to be an abstract class that implements the interface used by the main code for the entity in question. E.g. CodecSpec knows how to build encoders and decoders. It can have many implementations.; - The file version essentially determines which Spec implementations are allowed in the file. Each spec should have a notion of when it was introduced (or deprecated, if we bump the major version) but each implementation should have its own name/version. I was imagining FooRVD2Spec if we needed a new version of the existing RVD specs.; - The type hints in the JSON determine what Spec implementation to use (e.g. UnpartitionedRVDSpec). With this design, you can't change name of an existing spec.; - The Spec is also the intended place for code which matches the interface (which might evolve) with the legacy data in the JSON file (which cannot change).; - The file format is only used to check compatibility. The Spec class hierarchy should drive the decoding of the Specs, not the file format.; - Specs that are not being generated anymore (but still need to be read) should go into a compatibility package.

Modifiability,"This seems like the right approach. The other option is to expose the password in the config which we are trying to avoid. So ... even this is not idempotent. The current version of batch doesn't guarantee that children (or multiple retries of the same child) get the same or consistent set of files from their parents. This is because, while an attempt may have succeeded, there may be another attempt that is pending that succeeds and overwrites the outputs of the original successful attempt. I fixed this in my google batch backend by storing attempt outputs in per-attempt directory: /path/to/scratch/files/job_id/attempt_id/file.

Modifiability,"Update:. We were able to resolve this issues using a combination of three strategies. 1) We enabled [autoscaling](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/autoscaling) in our cluster. 2) We changed the spark partition defaults on our cluster to split data into 8,00 partitions. We had [read](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/support/spark-job-tuning) that this number could be changed to 3x the number of vCPUs on our cluster. Because we are using autoscaling, the number of vCPUs used is not predetermined. Because of this we started with 1x the maximum number of secondary workers in our cluster. Our maximum is set to 1000 n1-highmem-8 machines. These nodes contain 8 vCPUs each, so 8 x 1,000 = 8,000. After speaking with Google, we verified that we could have used 3x the maximum number of vCPUs to increase parallelism. With a maximum of 10 workers and 1,000 secondary workers, all n1-highmem-8 nodes, we could have increased our partition to 24,240. A sample cluster declaration using autoscaling and default shuffle partitions and parallelism of 8000 is below. 3) The hail team had informed us that ""You might try adding `block_size=2048` to your King invocation. That will reduce the memory requirements on the workers to ~1/4 of the default which should give ample room for the analysis."" Because of this, we changed the block size in king to ```block_size=2048```. After looking through the king [source code](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/_modules/hail/linalg/blockmatrix.html#BlockMatrix.default_block_size), we were able to determine the default block size is 4096. . ```; hailctl dataproc start cluster \; --vep GRCh38 \; --autoscaling-policy=MVP_autoscaling_policy \; --requester-pays-allow-annotation-db \; --packages gnomad \; --requester-pays-allow-buckets gnomad-public-requester-pays \; --secondary-worker-type=non-preemptible \; --master-machine-type=n1-highmem-8 \; --worker-machine-type=n1-highmem-8 \; --worker-boot-disk-size=1000 \; --preemptible-",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/12290#issuecomment-1284270117:162,config,configuring-clusters,162,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/12290#issuecomment-1284270117,1,['config'],['configuring-clusters']

Modifiability,"We spoke about this in person, but I had this mostly typed up in this buffer so I'll leave it here for future us. Some context on the docker build cache'ing situation. Originally, Docker would use any image layer it had as a cache source. This was noted as a severe security vulnerability because I could make an image that claims to be the result of `apt-get install curl` but actually was the result of `apt-get install virus`. In response, Docker banned the use of non-locally-built (i.e. from the Internet) image layers as cache sources. I believe there may have been other motivations as well, but I did not carefully investigate. https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/26065 documents the desire for a way to use non-locally-built images as a cache source. https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/26839 implements this. Unfortunately, and I cannot find documentation on this, `--cache-from X` means ""cache only from X"". If you pass multiple `--cache-from`s each one is used as a cache source, but it is not possible to say ""use all local images as a cache source"" (other than enumerating them all). [`--cache-from` was included in v1.13.0](https://github.com/moby/moby/releases/tag/v1.13.0), released January 2017. Another subtlety of `--cache-from` is that it does not pull the image in question if it is not found locally. I only found this documented [in a comment on the implementing PR](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/26839#issuecomment-277383550). Docker seems to be in maintenance mode and all new development is going into Moby. The replacement for `docker build` is called [`buildkit`](https://github.com/moby/buildkit).

So importing files can define functions, so they can be used later, but those functions are not run (how could they be?). By putting the imports inside the functions themselves, we defer the import of aiohttp from when the deploy_config is imported to when the functions that depend on `aiohttp` are actually used.

This is basically to flush out any edge cases that you wouldn't be hitting with a more basic/structured test that wouldn't reach the correct internal state to trigger it. . I've found that creating a simple test structure that mimics the desired end result and using the random generator to generate comparison tests (with the count set pretty high) is generally a pretty good way of sanity checking and flushing these bugs out, rather than writing specific test cases---usually if I've written a test for a specific case, I won't have missed it when coding, and if I've missed an edge case when coding, I won't think to test it. I think I'm pushing on this extra hard because the generated code is at a level of complexity where I can look at it and say ""yeah, this looks generally right"" but I'm not sure that I trust myself, as the reviewer, to guarantee that it's accounted for every single insert configuration correctly, if that makes sense.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6942#issuecomment-530961530:203,config,configurations,203,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6942#issuecomment-530961530,2,['config'],"['configuration', 'configurations']"

Modifiability,"at immediately come to mind) to the `hailctl dataproc` group level or by adding definitions for those arguments to all `hailctl dataproc` commands.; - On the subject of `--`, a current issue with `hailctl dataproc submit` is that it does not support `--` for specifying parameters to the submitted script like `gcloud dataproc jobs submit` does. Thus, for example, you cannot currently submit a script that has a `--files` argument because `--files` will be interpreted as an argument to `hailctl dataproc submit` instead of the submitted script. It would be nice to support that behavior in `hailctl dataproc submit`. However, with this parsing approach, supporting script arguments like that might conflict with accepting pass through arguments to `gcloud dataproc jobs submit` such as `--async`, `--bucket`, etc. And more minor:; - For `hailctl dataproc start` especially, it could seem pretty arbitrary to a user which arguments go before `--` vs after. For example, `--num-worker-local-ssds` is a `hailctl dataproc start` argument, but `--num-secondary-worker-local-ssds` is not. This could cause some confusion/annoyance. This could potentially be reduced by minimizing the number of `gcloud dataproc` arguments that are defined as `hailctl dataproc` arguments. For example, `--num-worker-local-ssds` is just passed through to `gcloud`, so there's no real need for it to be a `hailctl dataproc start` argument. On the other hand, it is nice to have some of those `gcloud` arguments show up in `hailctl dataproc start --help`.; - While making breaking changes, it would be nice if the `--configuration`/`--gcloud-configuration` argument was consistent across `hailctl dataproc` commands. For example, currently `hailctl dataproc start` takes `--configuration` but `hailctl dataproc submit` takes `--gcloud-configuration`. It would also be nice to standardize on kebab case for all arguments. There are some other arguments that use underscores (ex. `--init_timeout` to `hailctl dataproc start`).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9842#issuecomment-757016034:2799,config,configuration,2799,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9842#issuecomment-757016034,4,['config'],['configuration']

Modifiability,"cc @iris-garden: You might find this discussion interesting. > Is it kosher to use write_output on the individual items within a ResourceGroup like this?. Yes, that is fine. > The resulting code is IMHO overall less clear than the original version in which the resource group models the relationship between all three filenames. The resource group was intended for sets of files that should be **localized** together. The primary motivation was for PLINK files with `.bed, .bim, and .fam` extensions. This is not quite your use case. > If Hail Batch is a well-rounded orthogonal API, then that code ought to work too. It's a fair criticism that the ResourceGroup API isn't very flexible. We can think about ways to improve it. It's unclear from your code what exactly you want to have happen. Do you want to be able to declare not to localize the tsv only file?

Modifiability,"eneric index operations (not sure what to call these). I'll first give some examples using informal notation, then I'll give a proposal for an IR representation. I'll say ""sum"" everywhere, but that could be any aggregation. Let T be a 1-tensor. O represents the output of the operation. Then. * `T(i) -> O()` is the sum of T. * `T(i) -> O(i)` is identity. * `T(i) -> O(i, i)` makes a square matrix whose diagonal is T. * `T(i) -> O(i, j)` and `T(i) -> O(j, i)` broadcast T over a matrix in the two possible directions. Now let T be a 2-tensor. * `T(i, j) -> O(i)` is the vector of row-sums of T. * `T(i, i) -> O(i)` is the diagonal of T. * `T(i, i) -> O()` is the trace of T. * `T(i, j) -> O(j, i)` is transposition. How do we represent matrix multiplication? Let T1 and T2 be 2-tensors. Then letting `T = Out(T1, T2, ""and"").map((x, y) => x * y)`, the matrix product is given by. * `T(i, j, j, k) -> O(i, k)`. In general, an index operation on T requires specifying an output tensor O (including its shape, though you can deduce that in non-broadcasting cases), a set of index variables (eg. ""i, j, k""), and an assignment of a variable to each dimension of T and O. . More abstractly, let DT and DO be the sets of dimensions of T and O. An index operation consists of a set I and two functions DT -> I <- DO, a ""cospan"". These operations compose by cospan composition, which involves a pushout (a disjoint union and a quotient). Let i: DT -> I and o: DO -> I be the two maps assigning index variables. It helps to consider some special cases (compare to the examples above):. * If i is surjective, and o is identity, this is extracting a diagonal from T. * If i is injective, and o is identity, this is a broadcast. * If i is identity, and o is surjective, this embeds T as a diagonal of a higher-dimensional output tensor. * If i is identity, and o is injective, this is a pure aggregation, summing out some dimensions of T. To make composition easy to compute, we could represent an index operation",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5190#issuecomment-457598772:2995,variab,variables,2995,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5190#issuecomment-457598772,1,['variab'],['variables']

Modifiability,"h MakeArray?. I have some thoughts on that, but I think it would require a bigger change to how we represent streams in the IR. One idea is to put stream producers and stream consumers on equal footing. Right now, a stream consumer is a node with a stream child that produces a non-stream value, e.g. `ArrayFor(stream, name, body)`. We could let stream consumers be values themselves, `ArrayFor(name, body)`, with other nodes for connecting producers with consumers, e.g. `RunStream(stream, ArrayFor(name, body))`. Then I think we would need two `MakeStream`s, one that can be unrolled, and one that can be zipped. The former just directly takes a consumer and produces a value (and can choose to duplicate the consumer code or wrap it in a method). The later constructs a stream producer, which can be freely used in zips, etc. It would definitely require some thought how to optimize such a representation (is there a normal form?). > I'm not sure I see that. If you don't duplicate the consumer, the push code is the same. The question is, do you use a variable + switch to track where you are in the MakeStream, or do you use the program counter via labels, where you get the latter from the former by code duplication. I think the easiest way to see it is to think about how you would zip two `MakeStream`s, both of which represent their state using the program counter. You could do it by statically fusing them into a single `MakeStream`, but what if it was something more complicated like `Zip(Map(MakeStream(...), ...), Filter(MakeStream(...), ...))`? You can't represent a compound state with a single program counter. At a higher level, you can only do the optimization of unrolling the `MakeStream` loop if that is the outermost loop in the generated code. A producer wanting to create the outermost loop is what I mean by a push stream. By contrast, to be able to zip arbitrary streams, you want the consumer to create the outermost loop, and on each iteration ""pull"" from each producer.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8148#issuecomment-591962972:1133,variab,variable,1133,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8148#issuecomment-591962972,1,['variab'],['variable']

Modifiability,"he Hadoop Configuration object could be null, which suggests a serialization error in HadoopFS. However, there are many others tests that by touch HadoopFS serialization, and none of them have problems.

Attempts to replicate:; 1) Local hail install, not using google storage connector, and reading 2 local vcfs:. ```python; gvcfs = ['./HG00096.g.vcf.gz',; './HG00268.g.vcf.gz']; hl.init(default_reference='GRCh38'); parts = [; {'start': {'locus': {'contig': 'chr20', 'position': 17821257}},; 'end': {'locus': {'contig': 'chr20', 'position': 18708366}},; 'includeStart': True,; 'includeEnd': True},; {'start': {'locus': {'contig': 'chr20', 'position': 18708367}},; 'end': {'locus': {'contig': 'chr20', 'position': 19776611}},; 'includeStart': True,; 'includeEnd': True},; {'start': {'locus': {'contig': 'chr20', 'position': 19776612}},; 'end': {'locus': {'contig': 'chr20', 'position': 21144633}},; 'includeStart': True,; 'includeEnd': True},; ]; parts_str = json.dumps(parts); vcfs = hl.import_vcfs(gvcfs, parts_str). ## Works fine; print(vcfs); ```; 2) Docker install based on Dockerfile.hail-build (built on top of the hail base image). This does use the gcs connector, and some sa key that has access to the bucket I specified. ```python; gvcfs = ['gs://user-nrru16jaxrwmnzkv5f35xfibg/HG00096.g.vcf.gz',; 'gs://user-nrru16jaxrwmnzkv5f35xfibg/HG00268.g.vcf.gz']; # ...; ## Works fine; print(vcfs); ```. ### TODO:; Manually replicate on a Dataproc cluster. Currently working on this, have a Java gateway closed error during hl.init(), which could be caused by a misspecified JAVA_HOME. So at the moment, I either believe it's either a permission issue, or some Dataproc configuration issue.

Modifiability,"http performance depends on how the library was installed.; It has C optimizations with Pure Python fallbacks. If Cython/GCC was not available on target machine at installation time the slow pure python code is executed.; In fact, aiohttp in optimized mode runs the same C written HTTP parser as Sanic. Sanic used to run multiple workers by default, aiohttp uses only one. On a real server it doesn't matter because usually the server is explicitly configured to run multiple web workers by gunicorn and (or) nginx config. Now Sanic switched to the single worker by default IIRC.; Anyway, looking on outdated performance comparisons in different blog posts doesn't show any useful numbers unless you re-run and check the numbers on your environment against latest (or used by you) versions. aiohttp uses standard `json` module by default, Sanic `ujson`. `ujson` is faster but it is not 100% compatible with the standard and can fall into memory dumps IIRC. You can configure aiohttp to run `ujson`, `orjson` or `rapidjson` if needed -- all speedups have own drawbacks. Very famous [Tech Empower Benchmark](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17&hw=ph&test=fortune) demonstrates that sanic is faster than aiohttp on JSON serialization but cannot pass other tests. Please decide is it important or not. The last cherry: Sanic has super fast URL router because it caches matching results. The feature is extremely useful for getting awesome numbers with `wrk` tool but in real life URL paths for server usually not constant. URLs like `/users/{userid}` don't fit in cache well :). P.S.; aiohttp has a place for optimization, we are working on it. There is no single bottleneck, the optimization requires careful improvements in many places, with keeping backward compatibility policy. I don't know the best criteria for choosing. My advice is: look on user API and choose what you like. P.P.S.; `Starlette` has own benefits and compromises as well, but the post is pretty huge already.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461299040:1750,config,configure,1750,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461299040,1,['config'],['configure']

Alternatively, we should create a separate login flow doesn't use oauth2 but uses production credentials.; - and interactively tested notebook2 creating notebooks (but haven't tested the config of the notebooks themselves). Summary of changes:; - auth service that handles login/logout flow via Google OAuth2 and user verification via /userdata endpoint. Web sessions are stored in the aiohttp_session cookie (encrypted), command line sessions are stored in tokens file: tokens.json. Token files potentially contain tokens for multiple namespaces (e.g. default and cseed in the example workflow above).; - sessions are now started in the database, table `users.sessions`, which have session_id (32 random bytes, base64-encoded), user_id, creation time and max_age (for expiry); - I write notebook2 to use our async stack; - added a notion of ""deploy config"" that has three parts: location (one of external, k8s or gce), default_namespace (the default namespace to find services), and service_namespace (of overrides for specific services ... so e.g. you can use the default auth with batch in cseed). deploy_config main function is to construct URLs to contact services.; - JWTs and the jwt secret key are gone.; - Simplified configuration/data file handling by enforcing consistent defaults. File paths should be determined by the location, which is loaded from HAIL_DEPLOY_CONFIG_FILE. If that isn't set, I look in ~/.hail/deploy_config.json, and if that doesn't exist, use external/default. All other configuration files are determined by the location: the tokens file is in ~/.hail/tokens.json for external, in /user-tokens/tokens.json for k8s, etc. What remains:; - what a `hailctl dev config` to set the (local) deploy config for switching between default and dev namespaces.; - salt session IDs in the database; - dev oauth2 key; - add `dev de",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6892#issuecomment-527970251:1607,config,config,1607,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6892#issuecomment-527970251,1,['config'],['config']

However, it's a bit clunkier than the utility method, and will cost a bit more memory. What do you think about keeping the method as a static method? Would you prefer it be moved off PString to some other location?. Also, this is probably a good time to discuss whether we want region in the constructor. Because if not, we can have one loadString function.

Modifiability,"ion strategy. We could probably build an SSLContext shim that contained two SSLContexts one with a root cert and one with the trusted certs and require certification verification to pass both. Seems easy to get wrong, so I'm inclined to not take this path. ### trusted cert lists. Yeah, it felt a little silly to duplicate the cert in each secret. However, this seems like the simplest approach if I require each principal to only trust a subset of incoming/outgoing principals. If I had one secret per principal, then I have to modify build.yaml or deployment.yamls if I modify the trust sets. That seemed error prone. If I had one secret with all the certs, then when a service starts up it has to select the trusted ones and only insert those into its certificate store. This seems OK, but a little harder to inspect. Duplicating a cert for each trust list to which it belongs occupies what seems like a good spot to me from a developer ergonomics perspective:; - O(trusts) modifications necessary to update/revoke the cert; - O(1) configuration to load a trust list; - no pod-start-time configuration; - the trust list is on the container's file system, so its easy to inspect. Small point: I don't pin the incoming certs yet due to the mTLS challenges. ### create on each deploy. Only creating certs if they don't exist is an easy change. Seems fine, though leaves unresolved how to rotate the certs. I guess I'm inclined to always recreate because it makes rotation the common case, forcing us to make it work well. I think the only way to do a no-downtime rotation is:; 1. create fresh certs; 2. create the trust lists including a principal's fresh cert and previous generation cert; 3. update all the secrets; 4. somehow ensure everyone has the latest secrets?; 5. notify all servers to refresh their certificates (nginx: send SIGHUP, aiohttp: we have to write something). We could stick a generation uuid in the secrets and keep refreshing services until the certificate uuid they read is the",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8561#issuecomment-617428243:2322,config,configuration,2322,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8561#issuecomment-617428243,2,['config'],['configuration']

Modifiability,"ittle unusual in this flow. I still think that it is helpful to set people up with an AR and keep them from footguns, but maybe that can go in a separate command that the initial init command points to once you're done? Something along the lines of ""if you get to the point where you need to upload custom container images, you can use hailctl to set up a registry""?. Another thing that gives me a little pause is the wording around google projects. I get that you need one to create a bucket, but I think we should just make sure to steer clear of the implication that you are ""selecting a GCP project to use for Hail Batch"", because that implies some link or ownership that isn't there. But I think there's a quick fix here: for a given resource that we *are* creating for hail use, like the temp bucket, ask for the name first and then ask which project it should be created in, using the projects listed in gcloud as choices with the option to write in your own. ### Regarding number of checks; I think it'd be good to avoid warnings when possible. From looking at this I see a pattern of; 1. Ask a leading question; 2. Emit a warning if the user selects the alternative option instead of the suggested option. I think I would prefer instead to ask a leading question and in the prompt explain why the alternative option might be undesirable. Then when they make a decision just move on. On a broader note, I think we should focus on having good documentation and linking to it over having perfectly thorough ; explanations in the CLI. At some point in an interactive setup if it gets longwinded I start spamming enter, but if it was quick and at the end it said something to the effect of: ""Your current configuration could result in excess cloud cost. See the documentation <here> about common pitfalls and how to avoid them"", I might decide to read through that FAQ with a more discerning eye. This is just my opinion though, I would be curious to see if other folks disagree regarding the UX.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13279#issuecomment-1648633012:2955,config,configuration,2955,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13279#issuecomment-1648633012,1,['config'],['configuration']

Modifiability,"n[T] -> (U -> Boolean) -> Gen[Unit]`; - A `Gen[Unit]` is a bit artificial because the test framework halts execution (presumably with an exception) when a counter-example is found. I instead prefer that `Prop.forAll` has type: `Gen[T] -> (U -> Boolean) -> Gen[Boolean]`; - Now `Prop.forAll` has the same type as `Gen.flatMap[Boolean]`. It seems the difference between `forAll` and `flatMap` is that `forAll` conceptually preforms a product operation while `flatMap` performs a sampling. However, I think they are, in reality, the same operation: sampling. The implementation for `GenProp3` looks like:. ``` scala; for (i <- 0 until p.count) {; val v1 = g1(p); val v2 = g2(p); val v3 = g3(p); val r = f(v1, v2, v3); if (!r) {; println(s""! ${prefix}Falsified after $i passed tests.""); println(s""> ARG_0: $v1""); println(s""> ARG_1: $v2""); println(s""> ARG_2: $v3""); assert(r); }; }; ```. Which could be re-written as:. ``` scala; for (i <- 0 until p.count) {; (for (v1 <- g1; v2 <- g2; v3 <- g3) {; if (!r) {; println(s""! ${prefix}Falsified after $i passed tests.""); println(s""> ARG_0: $v1""); println(s""> ARG_1: $v2""); println(s""> ARG_2: $v3""); assert(r); }; })(p); }; ```. The primary difference between `flatMap` and `forAll` seems to be in error reporting. We can fix this by noting `Gen[T]` is currently a Reader monad on `Parameters`. If we add a ""forAll stack"" to `Parameters` we could implement `forAll` as:. ``` scala; def forAll[T,U](gt: Gen[T], gu: T -> Gen[U]): Gen[U] =; for (t <- gt; u <- local(pushQuantified(t), gu(t)) yield u. def pushQuantified(x: Any)(Parameters p): Paramters =; new Parameters(p.rng, p.size, p.count, (x :: p.quanitifed)); ```. We complete the Reader monad transformation by adding the `local` operation to `class Gen[T]`. ``` scala; // in class Gen; def local(modify: Parameters -> Parameters, gu: Gen[U]): Gen[U] =; Gen { p => gu(modify(p)) }; ```. Finally, the `check` method can access this stack of quantified variables to provide a useful error message.

Modifiability,"ne rules). > Sometimes you want to split a long line inside of single quotes, but you don’t want the backslash/newline to appear in the quoted content. This is often the case when passing scripts to languages such as Perl, where extraneous backslashes inside the script can change its meaning or even be a syntax error. One simple way of handling this is to place the quoted string, or even the entire command, into a make variable then use the variable in the recipe. In this situation the newline quoting rules for makefiles will be used, and the backslash/newline will be removed. If we rewrite our example above using this method:; > ; > ```; > HELLO = 'hello \; > world'; > ; > all : ; @echo $(HELLO); > ```; > ; > we will get output like this:; > ; > ```; > hello world; > ```; >; > If you like, you can also use target-specific variables (see [Target-specific Variable Values](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Target_002dspecific.html)) to obtain a tighter correspondence between the variable and the recipe that uses it. It seems to me like there are not any great choices. Putting the JSON into a Make variable seems too magical and likely to confuse a newbie editing this file.

Modifiability,"onsistencies (like #9587). A nitpick though... is there a better name for the click context attribute than ""obj""?. > hailctl no longer takes --region (for gcloud dataproc commands). I compute region in GcloudRunner by checking dataproc/region or falling back to determining the region from the zone. I error if the region and zone are incompatible (gcloud would also do this). If consistency with `gcloud dataproc` is desired, I think the opposite (determining zone from cluster region) would be preferable. `gcloud dataproc` commands take a `--region` argument. [`--zone` is an optional argument for `gcloud dataproc clusters create`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/dataproc/clusters/create#--zone). When a cluster's zone is needed to run `gcloud compute` commands, it can be determined using `gcloud dataproc clusters describe <cluster> --format json`. `hailctl dataproc diagnose` currently does this. I believe the only reason that we currently require a zone be provided either in gcloud configuration or on the command line is to maintain backwards compatibility. `cloudtools` and earlier versions of `hailctl` had a default value for the `--zone` option of `hailctl dataproc start` (I think it was `us-central1-b`). > I stripped all gcloud pass through args from hailctl dataproc modify. There aren't any left.

I moved the help text from the removed options into the help for the modify command itself. The output of modify --help is included below. I have mixed feelings on this one.

Modifiability,"pistats.org/packages/aiohttp) vs [60K for Sanic](https://pypistats.org/packages/sanic). ; Precise download count is a very hard thing (it misses PyPI caches, installing from Linux packages and Docker images etc. etc.) -- but you see the difference anyway. Sanic team is a champion in the library promotion, guys do their job perfectly well. Performance comparison is even harder.; Libraries have different defaults: sanic worker installs *uvloop* by default, aiohttp doesn't do it but utilizes uvloop if `uvloop.install()` was called.; Moreover, the aiohttp performance depends on how the library was installed.; It has C optimizations with Pure Python fallbacks. If Cython/GCC was not available on target machine at installation time the slow pure python code is executed.; In fact, aiohttp in optimized mode runs the same C written HTTP parser as Sanic. Sanic used to run multiple workers by default, aiohttp uses only one. On a real server it doesn't matter because usually the server is explicitly configured to run multiple web workers by gunicorn and (or) nginx config. Now Sanic switched to the single worker by default IIRC.; Anyway, looking on outdated performance comparisons in different blog posts doesn't show any useful numbers unless you re-run and check the numbers on your environment against latest (or used by you) versions. aiohttp uses standard `json` module by default, Sanic `ujson`. `ujson` is faster but it is not 100% compatible with the standard and can fall into memory dumps IIRC. You can configure aiohttp to run `ujson`, `orjson` or `rapidjson` if needed -- all speedups have own drawbacks. Very famous [Tech Empower Benchmark](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17&hw=ph&test=fortune) demonstrates that sanic is faster than aiohttp on JSON serialization but cannot pass other tests.

One nice attribute of the current parsing method is that it does not allow this, since in most cases the hailctl argument shadows the gcloud argument of the same name.; - It looks like this creates some inconsistency in how the same argument must be provided to different `hailctl dataproc` commands. For example, `--project` can be directly provided to `hailctl dataproc start`, but it would have to go after the `--` for `hailctl dataproc list` or `hailctl dataproc modify`. That seems likely to be surprising/annoying for users. This could be solved by moving such flags (`--project`, `--region`, and `--configuration` are the ones that immediately come to mind) to the `hailctl dataproc` group level or by adding definitions for those arguments to all `hailctl dataproc` commands.; - On the subject of `--`, a current issue with `hailctl dataproc submit` is that it does not support `--` for specifying parameters to the submitted script like `gcloud dataproc jobs submit` does. Thus, for example, you cannot currently submit a script that has a `--files` argument because `--files` will be interpreted as an argument to `hailctl dataproc submit` instead of the submitted script. It would be nice to support that behavior in `hailctl dataproc submit`. However, with this parsing approach, supporting script arguments like that might conflict with accepting pass through arguments to `gcloud dataproc jobs submit` such as `--async`, `--bucket`, etc. And more minor:; - For `hailctl dataproc start` especially, it could seem pretty arbitrary to a user which arguments go before `--` vs after. For example, `--num-worker-local-ssds` is a `hailctl dataproc s",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9842#issuecomment-757016034:1176,config,configuration,1176,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9842#issuecomment-757016034,1,['config'],['configuration']

For some reasons the line numbers reported in CI log don't quite match up (using either IntelliJ's goto def - which could say be the result of referencing a different copy on the system - or the [2.7.1 branch on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/branch-2.7.1/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FileSystem.java)), so I followed the parameterization. Still need to figure out why lines reported don't match, but I've seen line number differences before between that reported for the compiled binary, and the uncompiled source. Lines of evidence:; 1) The line specified in the ci log suggests that Hadoop's fileSystem.open() command fails. It appears from examining the line and source, that the Hadoop Configuration object could be null, which suggests a serialization error in HadoopFS. However, there are many others tests that by touch HadoopFS serialization, and none of them have problems. If it's not a serialization error (say the URI object that hadoop looks for is null, or CACHE is null), it would not seem PR specific. 2) On local, with or without the google storage connector, I cannot replicate the error in cluster-read-vcfs.py.

Then. * `T(i) -> O()` is the sum of T. * `T(i) -> O(i)` is identity. * `T(i) -> O(i, i)` makes a square matrix whose diagonal is T. * `T(i) -> O(i, j)` and `T(i) -> O(j, i)` broadcast T over a matrix in the two possible directions. Now let T be a 2-tensor. * `T(i, j) -> O(i)` is the vector of row-sums of T. * `T(i, i) -> O(i)` is the diagonal of T. * `T(i, i) -> O()` is the trace of T. * `T(i, j) -> O(j, i)` is transposition.

In general, an index operation on T requires specifying an output tensor O (including its shape, though you can deduce that in non-broadcasting cases), a set of index variables (eg. ""i, j, k""), and an assignment of a variable to each dimension of T and O. . More abstractly, let DT and DO be the sets of dimensions of T and O. An index operation consists of a set I and two functions DT -> I <- DO, a ""cospan"". These operations compose by cospan composition, which involves a pushout (a disjoint union and a quotient). Let i: DT -> I and o: DO -> I be the two maps assigning index variables. It helps to consider some special cases (compare to the examples above):. * If i is surjective, and o is identity, this is extracting a diagonal from T. * If i is injective, and o is identity, this is a broadcast. * If i is identity, and o is surjective, this embeds T as a diagonal of a higher-dimensional output tensor. * If i is identity, and o is injective, this is a pure aggregation, summing out some dimensions of T.

Modifiability,"rry for the wall of text but I found these a little hard to articulate. ### Regarding number of prompts. I think this is my primary concern. There's a lot of great automation here, but it's a lot right off the bat. I think what this is aiming to do is make it quick and simple to start running batches and every time someone has to stop and ask someone a question as to how they should respond to some prompt that process gets longer and more complicated. I think it's worth considering what the first batch people should run might be and design for a minimal first experience. IMO, a temp bucket is an absolutely crucial piece of configuration before you can do anything interesting and configuring a temp bucket is something that `hailctl` can easily be very opinionated about. Container registry… I feel like there's harder questions there, and you can run a lot of cool batches before having to worry about provisioning your own. It's also not actually a part of the hailctl config (unless something has changed recently) so it feels a little unusual in this flow. I still think that it is helpful to set people up with an AR and keep them from footguns, but maybe that can go in a separate command that the initial init command points to once you're done? Something along the lines of ""if you get to the point where you need to upload custom container images, you can use hailctl to set up a registry""?. Another thing that gives me a little pause is the wording around google projects. I get that you need one to create a bucket, but I think we should just make sure to steer clear of the implication that you are ""selecting a GCP project to use for Hail Batch"", because that implies some link or ownership that isn't there.

Sure. > How is the Dockerfile meant to be used? As written it doesn't appear that it would work because there doesn't exist any regenie source code to COPY in. It's meant to create a Regenie docker image that we could use. It's a copy of the regenie c++ repo's dockerfile, with the removal of the ENTRYPOINT /usr/local/bin/regenie, so that I could issue a command that included an executable, which is convenient to give me the ability to check that intermediate files are actually created (wc, ls) by batch, and because that seems more idiomatic for batch. I don't think there is a published regenie image, but docker hub is down so can't double check. . You're right, I shouldn't have deleted the bulk of the repo, kept as is. Didn't want to deal with submodules. > I've made some other in-line comments in the python file. It's not clear to me how all those other files are related to the python files and I'm a bit uncomfortable adding a whole directory with a LICENSE file, especially when not all the files in the directory fall under that license (e.g. the regenie py file) and moreover the license makes claims about things linking to BGEN, which none of our code here does. The license is only contained within the folder with the licensed files. In a previous conversation with Nate/Cotton, if we use any open-source software, best to keep those files segregated, alongside their license (license must be kept alongside the code, easier to see the demarcation if in a separate folder). > We have some BGEN files for testing in the Hail src/test/resources.

Modifiability,"sses that backslash and newline to the shell. In Make 3.81, the `\` was also required but the newline and backslash *are not passed* to the shell. In other words: in 3.81, backslash-newline is always replaced with a space and in 4.0, backslash-newline is replaced with a space *except on recipe lines in which case it is necessary to indicate the recipe continues but it is also passed literally to the shell*. The docs page you linked directly addresses our use case and suggests we put the command inside of a make variable (thus triggering normal backslash-newline rules rather than the special recipe line rules). > Sometimes you want to split a long line inside of single quotes, but you don’t want the backslash/newline to appear in the quoted content. This is often the case when passing scripts to languages such as Perl, where extraneous backslashes inside the script can change its meaning or even be a syntax error. One simple way of handling this is to place the quoted string, or even the entire command, into a make variable then use the variable in the recipe. In this situation the newline quoting rules for makefiles will be used, and the backslash/newline will be removed. If we rewrite our example above using this method:; > ; > ```; > HELLO = 'hello \; > world'; > ; > all : ; @echo $(HELLO); > ```; > ; > we will get output like this:; > ; > ```; > hello world; > ```; >; > If you like, you can also use target-specific variables (see [Target-specific Variable Values](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Target_002dspecific.html)) to obtain a tighter correspondence between the variable and the recipe that uses it. It seems to me like there are not any great choices. Putting the JSON into a Make variable seems too magical and likely to confuse a newbie editing this file. Using escaped double quotes is less legible than literal JSON. Putting the whole JSON array on one line is quite long. I guess we can go with double quotes for now.

Modifiability,"think helped to reduce the number of places that are aware of the notion of a default_region. It's really now just isolated to the `InstanceCollectionManager`, since that's the piece of code that's making the decision ""use the default region when the cluster is small"". I didn't quite like the pattern of retrieving a default from a `LocationMonitor` just to give it right back to the location monitor in the next line. I think this way the `LocationMonitor` API is much simpler, and we can actually remove its `default_location` method entirely as I believe it is no longer used. I can do that in a follow-up PR if you like this approach. One other thing is I wanted to articulate the distinction between the ""region CI needs its jobs in"" and the ""default region that batch will spin up workers in for small clusters"". While they are in practice the same, I found that treating them both as the ""default_region"" tied the logic around jobs for CI closely with internal Batch decisions and made it more confusing for me to reason about. I tried to separate out these two concepts so that in the future when jobs support region-specific scheduling it will be easier to excise the CI-specific code from the Batch scheduler. Another thing that I realized during this process is that Azure has regions and zones just like GCP, though they may differ slightly since we don't need to specify a zone for a VM and such. I am fine with using the term ""location"" to mean ""where we scheduled the VM, either zone or region depending on the cloud provider"", but I would also like to follow up with a sweep that makes this language more precise where possible. For example, the `possible_cloud_locations` function is really just `possible_cloud_regions`, and we could even go so far as mandating a `region` field in the global config instead of having `azure_location` and `gcp_region`, which are synonymous even though named differently. It also leads me to wonder why we only schedule in a single region in Azure?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12078#issuecomment-1207095240:1837,config,config,1837,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12078#issuecomment-1207095240,1,['config'],['config']

Modifiability,"to become C++11-compliant. Systems using the earlier libstdc++; (which also typically have g++-4.8.x/4.9x) have the old-ABI not-fully-compliant std::string; (and std::list, but I've gone 20 years without ever using that). Later versions of libstdc++ have *both* flavors of std::string, but use namespaces to allow them; to coexist (but not to be interchangeable, so interfaces between old-ABI and new-ABI are; problematic). https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html. ""In the GCC 5.1 release libstdc++ introduced a new library ABI that includes new implementations of std::string and std::list. These changes were necessary to conform to the 2011 C++ standard which forbids Copy-On-Write strings and requires lists to keep track of their size. In order to maintain backwards compatibility for existing code linked to libstdc++ the library's soname has not changed and the old implementations are still supported in parallel with the new ones. This is achieved by defining the new implementations in an inline namespace so they have different names for linkage purposes, e.g. the new version of std::list<int> is actually defined as std::__cxx11::list<int>. Because the symbols for the new implementations have different names the definitions for both versions can be present in the same library."". OSX doesn't have this ABI-compatibility issue because for several years it has been using; libc++ as the default library, and libc++ is a post-C++11 rewrite-from-scratch implementation; of the required standard-library functionality. My understanding is that it is perfectly feasible to mix and match different g++/clang++compiler; versions and different libstdc++ versions. It just doesn't happen very much because both the; g++ version and the libstdc++ are chosen at the same time, early in building a Linux distribution,; and then are frozen throughout the release's lifetime to ensure interoperability of binaries. So debian8's version of g++ and libstdc++ doesn't change.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4422#issuecomment-424797612:1941,rewrite,rewrite-from-scratch,1941,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4422#issuecomment-424797612,1,['rewrite'],['rewrite-from-scratch']

Modifiability,"v oauth2 key. Alternatively, we should create a separate login flow doesn't use oauth2 but uses production credentials.; - and interactively tested notebook2 creating notebooks (but haven't tested the config of the notebooks themselves). Summary of changes:; - auth service that handles login/logout flow via Google OAuth2 and user verification via /userdata endpoint. Web sessions are stored in the aiohttp_session cookie (encrypted), command line sessions are stored in tokens file: tokens.json. Token files potentially contain tokens for multiple namespaces (e.g. default and cseed in the example workflow above).; - sessions are now started in the database, table `users.sessions`, which have session_id (32 random bytes, base64-encoded), user_id, creation time and max_age (for expiry); - I write notebook2 to use our async stack; - added a notion of ""deploy config"" that has three parts: location (one of external, k8s or gce), default_namespace (the default namespace to find services), and service_namespace (of overrides for specific services ... so e.g. you can use the default auth with batch in cseed). deploy_config main function is to construct URLs to contact services.; - JWTs and the jwt secret key are gone.; - Simplified configuration/data file handling by enforcing consistent defaults. File paths should be determined by the location, which is loaded from HAIL_DEPLOY_CONFIG_FILE. If that isn't set, I look in ~/.hail/deploy_config.json, and if that doesn't exist, use external/default. All other configuration files are determined by the location: the tokens file is in ~/.hail/tokens.json for external, in /user-tokens/tokens.json for k8s, etc. What remains:; - what a `hailctl dev config` to set the (local) deploy config for switching between default and dev namespaces.; - salt session IDs in the database; - dev oauth2 key; - add `dev deploy` service override option so we can use production/default auth with services deployed in dev namespaces.

Modifiability,"wasn't very clear about where information lived. I had imagined that the pools and the JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM) owned the information. Nit: the doc doesn't say the instance monitor monitors instances, it just monitors and handles *events*. Let me be explicit: I think the doc is wrong about the monitor doing health checking because that requires it to track the instances, which I just said should be owned by the pools and the JPIM. That didn't occur to me when we were writing the doc, my apologies. I still think the monitor should:; - route events to the right pool or to the JPIM, and; - aggregate summaries up for the web UI. ---. Let me try to be more specific in my critique:. I think of the system as three layers: the top most is the driver, the middle layer is the monitor, and the bottom layer is the pool or JobPrivateInstanceManager (JPIM). I don't want control flow to go down, up, and back down again. If that happens, then we can't reason about our system as separate layers, we necessarily have to think about the middle and bottom layer together. Very specifically, this flow worries me: (instance pool) create_instance -> (instance monitor) add_instance -> adjust_for_add_instance -> (instance pool) adjust_for_add_instance. We move from low to mid *back to low*. I want information to flow in one direction: either its downward information or its upward information. ---. I'm guessing you're also concerned about code organization / code duplication. I'm not that worried about this. The JPIM and the Pool are similar things and we might inevitably produce some duplication. That's OK with me. To be honest, I think a few stand-alone functions that both of them use will eliminate any code duplication. Both pools and the JPIM will have a `name_instances` and `instance_by_last_updated`. If the duplication gets hard to manage, we might pack that up into another class like InstanceCollection. I realize this means we have several monitoring loops.

Performance," 3.6. The `hail-ubuntu` image explicitly installs Python 3.7. I'm happy to drop linting for Python 3.6 from build.yaml if compilers team is OK with that (ask Tim). We are already using Ubuntu 20.04 for our services and tests. See below for details, but `hail-ubuntu` is based on 20.04. We explicitly install JDK 8 in the `base` image. ---. This PR doesn't change the hail-ubuntu image which is the basis for nearly all our images. `DOCKER_ROOT_IMAGE` seems to have been introduced [here](https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9660). That's my bad for not flagging in the review that this isn't actually a ""root image"". `DOCKER_ROOT_IMAGE` is just some Linux image with the standard utils. It was introduced as a distinct global concept when Docker Hub began enforcing rate limits (so we needed all our test images to live in GCR). If you look at the occurrences of `DOCKER_ROOT_IMAGE` or `docker_root_image` you'll find it's almost exclusively used in the tests except for one occurrence in `build-batch-worker-image-startup-gcp.sh`. We could just remove that line. That line is an attempt to keep a relatively recent version of the ubuntu image cached on the worker VM so that we can save some time when pulling the worker Docker image. In practice, the ubuntu image is extraordinarily tiny and quickly becomes out of date (because we rarely rebuild the VM). hail-ubuntu uses a timestamped ubuntu 20.04 tag: `ubuntu:focal-20201106`. I did this because we kept getting screwed by new ubuntu images getting released which were incompatible with us. We would only find out later when we changed the hail-ubuntu Dockerfile and triggered a refetch of the latest image at the `ubuntu:18.04` tag which included the breaking changes. You're correct that this is technical debt of ours. DOCKER_ROOT_IMAGE should really be SOME_LINUX_IMAGE and we shouldn't bother trying to fetch it in the worker image startup script. You're fighting the good fight, but, man, keeping a growing software project clean is hard.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11046#issuecomment-965578805:1355,cache,cached,1355,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11046#issuecomment-965578805,1,['cache'],['cached']

As an aside I've spent some time reading about this over the last ~month, and besides relatively consistent messaging about the messiness of Python's ecosystem, performance and user experience are deeply important to me, so when I read things like:. ""I don’t think performance matter. I think asgi does not matter in 2018 in general. Usability and complexity matters. Python is not very good choice for high performance system in any case...For me high performance python is a fantasy, but i don’t do aiohttp/python anymore. In the end it is up to @asvetlov"". from one of the creators of aiohttp, I'm not encouraged about the long-term health of the project. https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2902. In the second branch related to this pull request, linked above, I chose Starlette, and it is a thin abstraction, nearly identical performance, over Uvicorn + httptools, which were both written by Yury Selivanov, the asyncio person I mention above. Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 . Starlette is something like base Go performance (though 1/5-1/10th the performance of Go's fasthttp library for simple responses, and much closer for anything involving database calls). Sanic also uses httptools and uvloop, but has more stuff.. so yeah maybe a bit slower than Starlette, or not, but the diff will probably be small. Regarding the benchmark you linked, it is benchmarking the power of sleep. There is something deeply wrong with their results. Sanic has 1800 timeouts, vs 200 for aiohttp, and 3x the connection errors. Fine, so Sanic is super slow.

I (and others) are currently pushing very hard for the VCF spec to support two sparse representations: ""local alleles"" ([samtools/hts-specs#434](https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/pull/434)) and ""reference blocks"" ([samtools/hts-specs#435](https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/pull/435)). When using these two sparse representations, you should be able to store 35,000 whole genomes in ~10TiB of GZIP-compressed VCF.; > ; > What is your calling pipeline? Do you generate GVCFs? If yes, I strongly recommend you use the [VDS Combiner](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/vds/hail.vds.combiner.VariantDatasetCombiner.html#hail.vds.combiner.VariantDatasetCombiner) to produce a [VDS](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/vds/index.html). You can read more details in [this recent preprint we wrote](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.09.574205v1.full.pdf), but a VDS of 35,000 whole genomes should be a few terabytes. I'd guess 4 TiB, but it depends on your reference block granularity. I strongly recommend using size 10 GQ buckets. Looks like VDS is a better solution than HailMatrix. However, we got the joint call result as vcf alreay. Can VDS Combiner read joint call VCF and then save it as VDS format? I cannot find any example to transfer VCF to VDS.

My conclusion is that Kryo still has a bug preventing the serialization of very large objects. This becomes a limitation in Hail: we cannot support PLINK files with tens of millions of variants. Our community is largely transitioning to GVCFs and VDS, so I doubt we'll improve our PLINK1 importer to support such large PLINK1 files.

Performance," a diagram of the current and proposed scenarios that I hope helps:. ### Normal services (current `main`); 1. gateway receives a request destined for `batch.hail.is`; 2. gateway intends to forward this request to `batch.default:443`; 3. gateway makes a DNS request to resolve `batch.default`. gateway receives IP `A.A.A.A` which is the cluster IP of the batch Kubernetes Service; 4. gateway forwards the request to `A.A.A.A:443`; 5. The Kubernetes Service (really kube-proxy) receives the request, selects a pod with IP `X.X.X.X` and forwards the request to `X.X.X.X:5000`. ### Proposed headless service approach; 1. gateway receives a request destined for `batch.hail.is`; 2. gateway intends to forward this request to `batch.default:443`; 3. gateway makes a DNS request to resolve `batch.default`. gateway receives multiple DNS records back saying that `batch.default` corresponds to the IP addresses `X.X.X.X`, `Y.Y.Y.Y`, and `Z.Z.Z.Z` (assuming there are 3 pods in the deployment).; 4. gateway gets its pick out of the pods (this is really important and is why envoy needs all the IPs to properly load balance!) and decides to forward the request directly to pod `X.X.X.X:443`. So in the second scenario, it is necessary that the pod itself be listening on 443 because that is where gateway is going to send the request. It is not exactly a permissions issue, but upon writing this I am now realizing that by doing so we *require* that the service pods like `auth` and `batch` be running as root in order to bind on port 443. I think the port specified in the `Service` yaml is actually useless now. So two actionable options are:. 1. Remove the useless `port` field on the `Service` yaml for auth, batch, etc.; 2. Keep all of our services on unprivileged ports (5000) and have gateway forward traffic to `batch.default:5000` instead of `batch.default:443`. Keeping our services on port 5000 could allow us to run those services as non-root users.

Performance," a near drop-in for Flask, and is the most popular afaik library built around asyncio. It has 2x as many stars as aiohttp, slightly more forks. The original motivation for considering aiohttp: ; https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking. In short, one of the creators of asyncio discusses uvloop performance relative to other libraries. They key is:. ""However, the performance bottleneck in aiohttp turned out to be its HTTP parser, which is so slow, that it matters very little how fast the underlying I/O library is."". <img width=""1001"" alt=""screen shot 2019-02-06 at 7 29 00 pm"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5543229/52382977-77a62d00-2a45-11e9-8c04-b8142586eb5c.png"">. <img width=""936"" alt=""screen shot 2019-02-06 at 7 29 19 pm"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5543229/52382985-812f9500-2a45-11e9-9155-97c00ef9784b.png"">. As an aside I've spent some time reading about this over the last ~month, and besides relatively consistent messaging about the messiness of Python's ecosystem, performance and user experience are deeply important to me, so when I read things like:. ""I don’t think performance matter. I think asgi does not matter in 2018 in general. Usability and complexity matters. Python is not very good choice for high performance system in any case...For me high performance python is a fantasy, but i don’t do aiohttp/python anymore. In the end it is up to @asvetlov"". from one of the creators of aiohttp, I'm not encouraged about the long-term health of the project. https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2902. In the second branch related to this pull request, linked above, I chose Starlette, and it is a thin abstraction, nearly identical performance, over Uvicorn + httptools, which were both written by Yury Selivanov, the asyncio person I mention above. Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks.

Performance," directly to your last comment. > We have a difference of opinion about the risks. I think I'd say we have a difference of opinion about the importance of the risks. I'm well aware of the potential pitfalls you list there, and more. I just don't think they're a very big deal. I'm also aware of a shit ton of things that are vastly more important than what we're arguing about and we're not talking about those. Let's talk about goals for the project and the landscape of technical risk in our next 1:1. This is assuming we're controlling the compiler in the packaged distribution and on the cloud, we're testing representative user pipelines against gcc and clang, so the scenario you're imagining is either a Hail developer or someone who is sophisticated enough to maintain a Spark cluster (1000x worse configuration nonsense than we're arguing about here, I promise) who is either (1) running old or obscure compiler, or (2) ran into a bug that had test coverage. You're worrying about (1)? What's the worst that will happen, seriously? We'll get a bug report? Let's make sure the compiler version is in the log. > A couple of years ago; > g++ take 40-60 seconds to compile; > fairly heavily templated cod. Can we avoid heavily (or even moderately) templated code? I'm already nervous long-term about the latency of the C++ compiler overhead and if I'm being honest would prefer to generate LLVM IR directly into memory. We should ship whatever compiler is best on the cloud and in the download package. That already covers a vast majority of our users. If clang is the clear winner, we can make that clear in the documentation and maybe warn about gcc it on startup. > But that becomes a problem in itself if we want the shipped compiler to work on a variety of OS'es. Variety isn't a requirement. We don't need to make this hard for ourselves. Let's have two versions: OSX and a recent linux. If we're getting a lot of requests/questions/issues about older versions of linux, we can reevaluate.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-410134414:1334,latency,latency,1334,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-410134414,1,['latency'],['latency']

Performance," image that was previously associated with it. That image is still in the registry though. I thought that was sufficient for the cache to work. (I was wrong, see below!). AFAICT, this change doesn't prevent PR tests from pushing to the `cache` tag. This change just makes the tests run by the CI-in-the-PR not overwrite the cache. Every image build for a PR (which is tested by default namespace CI) will still overwrite the cache tag. AFAICT, this; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo; ```; Will use as a cache source the `latest` tag in the `gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo` repository. It is *not* sufficient for an image to be present in the repository and untagged or with a different tag from `latest`. In particular, every push to the `cache` tag prevents us from using other images even though they are in the registry! For example, I pushed two images to `cache`:. ```; (base) # gcloud container images list-tags gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest; DIGEST TAGS TIMESTAMP; fb551d9bdb94 2022-06-10T14:16:39; afb4c5ad2d7b cache,latest 2022-06-10T14:15:55; ```. If I rebuild [1] the most recently pushed image with; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest:cache; ```; it succeeds in getting the cache. If I rebuild the other image with the same import-cache, it does not see that the (untagged) image is already there! . ---. This all suggests that all our attempts at image caching are failing terribly. Options:; 1. Only deploy builds push to a `:cache` tag, everyone uses that tag.; 2. List all the tags in the repository and include them all as --cache-from's (this doesn't actually work: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34715#issuecomment-425933774); 3. Push a tag for each git SHA and then include as --cache-from's the last ten git SHAs on this branch, the most recent common commit with main (i.e. `git merge-base origin/main this-branch`), maybe the current main, and maybe the PR number?; 4.

Write our own OCI image builder so we can write our own OCI image cache that actually works the way it ought to (everything in the registry is considered fair game for the cache). It seems like 3 is actually a decent solution that should enable lots of caching.; 1. The last ten SHAs on the branch should speed up repeated builds when you're fixing little bugs.; 2. The most recent common commit with main should avoid rebuilds unless the packages changed.; 3. I suspect the current main is actually not helpful (either 2 will work or 3 wouldn't help).; 4. Pushing to something like `cache-11907` would allow force pushes to still access the last build's images. What do you think of the #3 proposal? . ---.

Performance," this:; 1. For runImage steps, you can only copy out-of or copy into `/io` (the reasoning is a bit complicated and somewhat historical).; 2. For buildImage steps, you can copy out-of or copy into `/`; 3. the `to` of an `output` specifies a file path in a ""filesystem"" that another step can access if it `dependsOn` the outputting step; 4. the `from` of an `input` specifies a file path in the aforementioned ""filesystem""; the filesystem contains all `outputs` from steps in the inputting step's `dependsOn` clause. We also have a `docker/Makefile` which is an emergency manual build system. I update that so that `hail_version` appears in the root of the docker context. The `service-base` uses the entire repository as its docker context, so I place hail_version at the root of the repository. I moved the `version` function from `hailtop.hailctl` into `hailtop`. It seems broadly useful and isn't specific to hailctl in anyway. Your concern about loading from pkg_resources repeated seems well-founded, so I went ahead and loaded the hail_version at package import time. This seems likely to ensure we learn about a missing hail_version file as early as possible (presumably at service start-time). This also means all hailtop installs need a hail_version file. I only found two other places that use hailtop. One of them was a completely unused Dockerfile. I deleted that (`Dockerfile.hailtop`). The other was Dockerfile.ci-test, which I updated to copy the hail_version file just like service-base. https://github.com/hail-is/hail/compare/main...danking:add-version-endpoint. Do you want to cherry-pick that change onto your add-version-endpoint branch?. One more change request: can we remove the try-catch? I don't expect any errors in that call and I tend to avoid revealing anything about errors to our users. Aiohttp will log the error and the stack trace if you let it rise all the way.

Performance,# EDIT: See end of thread for new approach. The issue is that `use OpenBLAS` puts `libopenblas.so` on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. `netlib-java` links against `libblas.so` which is expected to contain the CBLAS symbols. It appears that Debian-style distributions use `update-alternatives` to symlink `libblas.so` to a library of the user's choice. Broad's UGER cluster does not provide such `update-alternatives` functionality. There exists two fixes:; - create a symlink to `libopenblas.so` named `libblas.so` and put it on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH; - use `LD_PRELOAD` to forcibly load `libopenblas.so`. The two solutions look like:. 1.; ```; mkdir ~/lib; ln -s /broad/software/free/Linux/redhat_7_x86_64/pkgs/openblas_0.2.20/lib/libopenblas.so ~/lib/libblas.so.3; export LD_LIBARRY_PATH=~/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; ```. 2.; ```; export LD_PRELOAD=/broad/software/free/Linux/redhat_7_x86_64/pkgs/openblas_0.2.20/lib/libopenblas.so; ```. Clearly neither of these are ideal. I recommend users place the lines from option 1 in an rc file.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/5559#issuecomment-472953523:567,load,load,567,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/5559#issuecomment-472953523,1,['load'],['load']

Performance,"'t be scheduled right away. I definitely saw this case (e.g. I refreshed and then got the notebook). > I think imagePullPolicy: Never is a bad idea. Agreed, too aggressive. > I think we should rely on k8s to pull the 5GB jupyter image in a reasonable time period. No. I'm going to be demanding about making our tools responsive with good feedback (not responsive in the sense of responsive web design, but responsive in the sense of fast). It has to be fast, and when can't be, it has to give clear feedback about what it's doing and how long it will take. We routinely see pulling a 5GB image take 1-2m. That's spin up a VM level nonsense. Kubernetes 1.6 had an SLO to schedule 99% of pre-pulled containers within 5s on a 5K node cluster (from the plots it looks like they were closer to 2s):. > Pod startup time: 99% of pods and their containers (with pre-pulled images) start within 5s. from http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Soglxt0kAI0J:blog.kubernetes.io/2017/03/scalability-updates-in-kubernetes-1.6.html+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us. When we have to pull an image, I want spinner and the estimated spin time. If we have to spin up a node, same. (I know this is a first cut. I'm just saying where I'd like to see us head.). > I just run make clean-jobs, but we could add a delete endpoint and a little web page. OK, here's my picture:; - first time, prompt for password,; - if no notebook is running launch one and go straight there,; - if notebook is running, get a page with a link to the notebook and a link to kill it. That might be considered strange web design (skip the console depending on the state), in which case I'd vote for the console always. (What Jupyter hub does.). > I thought it would take less time to get a subdirectory working than figure out how to add a new domain and a cert and deal with DNS. Fair.

Performance,". The original motivation for considering aiohttp: ; https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking. In short, one of the creators of asyncio discusses uvloop performance relative to other libraries. They key is:. ""However, the performance bottleneck in aiohttp turned out to be its HTTP parser, which is so slow, that it matters very little how fast the underlying I/O library is."". <img width=""1001"" alt=""screen shot 2019-02-06 at 7 29 00 pm"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5543229/52382977-77a62d00-2a45-11e9-8c04-b8142586eb5c.png"">. <img width=""936"" alt=""screen shot 2019-02-06 at 7 29 19 pm"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5543229/52382985-812f9500-2a45-11e9-9155-97c00ef9784b.png"">. As an aside I've spent some time reading about this over the last ~month, and besides relatively consistent messaging about the messiness of Python's ecosystem, performance and user experience are deeply important to me, so when I read things like:. ""I don’t think performance matter. I think asgi does not matter in 2018 in general. Usability and complexity matters. Python is not very good choice for high performance system in any case...For me high performance python is a fantasy, but i don’t do aiohttp/python anymore. In the end it is up to @asvetlov"". from one of the creators of aiohttp, I'm not encouraged about the long-term health of the project. https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2902. In the second branch related to this pull request, linked above, I chose Starlette, and it is a thin abstraction, nearly identical performance, over Uvicorn + httptools, which were both written by Yury Selivanov, the asyncio person I mention above. Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 .

Performance,"/hail-vdc/foo` repository. It is *not* sufficient for an image to be present in the repository and untagged or with a different tag from `latest`. In particular, every push to the `cache` tag prevents us from using other images even though they are in the registry! For example, I pushed two images to `cache`:. ```; (base) # gcloud container images list-tags gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest; DIGEST TAGS TIMESTAMP; fb551d9bdb94 2022-06-10T14:16:39; afb4c5ad2d7b cache,latest 2022-06-10T14:15:55; ```. If I rebuild [1] the most recently pushed image with; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest:cache; ```; it succeeds in getting the cache. If I rebuild the other image with the same import-cache, it does not see that the (untagged) image is already there! . ---. This all suggests that all our attempts at image caching are failing terribly. Options:; 1. Only deploy builds push to a `:cache` tag, everyone uses that tag.; 2. List all the tags in the repository and include them all as --cache-from's (this doesn't actually work: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34715#issuecomment-425933774); 3. Push a tag for each git SHA and then include as --cache-from's the last ten git SHAs on this branch, the most recent common commit with main (i.e. `git merge-base origin/main this-branch`), maybe the current main, and maybe the PR number?; 4. Write our own OCI image builder so we can write our own OCI image cache that actually works the way it ought to (everything in the registry is considered fair game for the cache). It seems like 3 is actually a decent solution that should enable lots of caching.; 1. The last ten SHAs on the branch should speed up repeated builds when you're fixing little bugs.; 2. The most recent common commit with main should avoid rebuilds unless the packages changed.; 3. I suspect the current main is actually not helpful (either 2 will work or 3 wouldn't help).; 4. Pushing to something like `cache-11907` would allow force pushes to still access the ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11907#issuecomment-1152646800:1671,cache,cache-from,1671,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11907#issuecomment-1152646800,1,['cache'],['cache-from']

Performance,"1. I don't think this should be a user option. Too fine grained. 2. init has an explosion of options. I think we should have a centralized location for all the options and parameters. The feature flag stuff is a step in that direction, but needs to be more pervasive. Keep this all private/experimental for now. 3.

Performance,"1. I really don't understand what this code is trying to do. Can you give me a short explanation in English?. 2. I think you just need single-use Let forwarding to optimize this. It looks like:. Push down the TableCount. (TableCount (Paralellelize ...)) should turn into (ArrayLen (GetField rows ...)). Push the ArrayLen/GetField into the Let. (Is this what your ""MaximizeLets"" is doing? I think that would traditionally be called let lifting.). Now you have (Let __cols_and_globals (ArrayLen (GetField __cols (Ref __cols_and_globals))). Then you forward the single-use Let, and the rest of the code simplifies into (ArrayLen (TableCollect (TableRead ""cols""))), and that should have the static number of rows and be able to be simplified. 3. So how should single-use Let forwarding work? You need two things: to determine there is only one use, and that the single use isn't in a more expensive context, e.g. you don't want to forward a single-use Let into a loop: (Let expensive X (ArrayMap a x <use expensive once>)). Since our control flow is structured, there is a static notion of ""loop nesting depth"", e.g. in the above code, the Let has nesting depth 0, and the use in the ArrayMap body has nesting depth 1. You can only forward into the same nesting depth. 4. Final question is, do you want the let forwarding pass to also delete unused Lets? If you delete a let, that might delete references that make other lets single (or zero) use. In this case, it might be nice to build a ""use-def chain"" data structure, that keeps, for each let, its list of uses (and vice versa). Then, when you delete a Let, you can dynamically delete the references for the right hand side, possibly creating additional optimization opportunities.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5041#issuecomment-452863737:164,optimiz,optimize,164,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5041#issuecomment-452863737,2,['optimiz'],"['optimization', 'optimize']"
Performance,"1. Move the classes into is.hail.rvd. They aren't used anywhere else, are they?. 2. @maccum is working over LD prune, the GeneralRDD stuff shouldn't be necessary anymore. I think she's just working on optimization, so I feel like her current code is an improvement and should go in before the performance improvements are ready. 3. I agree, but, yeah, SKAT can't go until we get expr ndarray. 4. MatrixTable.same just uses zip, you can rewrite it in terms of zip based on my above comments. You might also need a version of zip that returns a RDD[T]. Compare RVD.map and RVD.mapPartitions. 5. I think the right thing here is an OrderedRVD.orderedIntervalJoin.

Performance,"2079a85bce (41 minutes):. I could try to make the tests even more fine-grained and split up even more long-running tests. Seems like some of the bottlenecks I'm hitting now are:; 1. Introducing an image with the wheel already installed isn't worthwhile, it adds 2.5 min latency.; 2. The large number of splits often requires default Hail to scale up adding a 2min delay (It would be great to get that down). I'm gonna revert the change that added images and maybe try to reduce service backend parallelism a bit. 36 minutes is an improvement. We should probably focus on making Hail faster rather than trying to squeeze lower latency out of parallelism. <img width=""2032"" alt=""Screen Shot 2023-05-22 at 12 30 47"" src=""https://github.com/hail-is/hail/assets/106194/aaa3fbb7-176d-4487-b65e-586c235e2089"">; <img width=""541"" alt=""Screen Shot 2023-05-22 at 12 31 23"" src=""https://github.com/hail-is/hail/assets/106194/016f1089-d08d-4555-ae86-c01353f39c78"">",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13076#issuecomment-1557548015:145,bottleneck,bottlenecks,145,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13076#issuecomment-1557548015,3,"['bottleneck', 'latency']","['bottlenecks', 'latency']"

It is *not* sufficient for an image to be present in the repository and untagged or with a different tag from `latest`. In particular, every push to the `cache` tag prevents us from using other images even though they are in the registry! For example, I pushed two images to `cache`:. ```; (base) # gcloud container images list-tags gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest; DIGEST TAGS TIMESTAMP; fb551d9bdb94 2022-06-10T14:16:39; afb4c5ad2d7b cache,latest 2022-06-10T14:15:55; ```.

If I rebuild the other image with the same import-cache, it does not see that the (untagged) image is already there! . ---. This all suggests that all our attempts at image caching are failing terribly. Options:; 1. Only deploy builds push to a `:cache` tag, everyone uses that tag.; 2.

Write our own OCI image builder so we can write our own OCI image cache that actually works the way it ought to (everything in the registry is considered fair game for the cache).

Maybe to handle large `MakeStream`s, and decomposing other streams into multiple methods, we could compile some streams into iterators.

Performance,"> Ah sorry, I forgot to update the original commit message as that's not actually correct. The optimization is that we don't need to iterate through all blobs until we find the exact blob matching our path name. The list operation returns all blobs that start with the prefix of that path. If we see a blob with a different name that is a child of our path f'{path}/foo, then we know it's a directory and don't need to iterate anymore (although it could be a file as well, but in Scala we don't currently throw errors on paths that are both files and directories, so we just choose the first we see). If we see a blob that matches the path exactly, then we know it's a file and stop iterating. The only reason we need to iterate through more than one blob is if there's blobs that are like '{path}zzzzz/foo or '{path}szzzzz. We need to ignore these as they don't provide any information on whether {path} is a file or directory. This is where isChildOf is needed because we need to make sure the blob is actually a child of the path such as '{path}/file and not {path}zzzzz/file. Ah thanks, this makes more sense to me now. > The other option is to do 2 queries. One to check if it's a file and the next to check if there are any child blobs.

I think in our current model, this means one active ShuffleClient at any given time (because there's only one active shuffle at any given time). However, I intend Hail service pipelines to be able to use multiple concurrent shuffles, if useful. In particular, a ShuffleClient has as type and an encoding, so its only useful for one type of dataset. Though you could theoretically re-use the object on a different dataset of the same type by calling `start` again. > which communicates with a ShuffleServer (which only connects to one ShuffleClient). I intended the ShuffleServer to serve an arbitrary number of non-adversarial clients (perhaps two different users in nascent hail service). I think it's pretty secure, but I don't think `UUID.randomUUID().toString()` is cryptographically random, so an adversary could probably guess it and thus get access to shuffle data. Moreover, the ShuffleServer must support concurrent connections from all the workers of a Hail pipeline. `ShuffleServer.serve` starts a fresh server thread for every connection. During the read or write phases of the shuffler, the idea is 1:1 mappings from workers to connections to server `Handler` threads. > Every time the hail context wants some data to be shuffled, the server creates a new shuffle ID to associate with the shuffle (starting the shuffle) and then the client sends over the data and can then access it, in ranges, using get. As soon as it starts a new shuffle, it can no longer access the data from the previous shuffle (at least through current interfaces---the shuffle server never deletes shuffled data, so we could theoretically define a put and get that take the uuid and then keep accessing older shuffles as long as we know the uuid).

So hail transforms data, say generates pc's, writes table, and then issues some batch commands that use a pre-built image, as opposed to requiring them to containerise their hail cod3.

Performance,"> The thinking behind this is that there's a huge amount of re-use of code for an individual from one Hail analysis to the next. So I'm not sure I buy this. Hail is a exploratory data analysis platform, it isn't a SQL engine running nightly billing reports. In particular, as we do whole stage optimization and code generation. It isn't clear to me how you do code-reuse when we're specializing each operation into the global context (happy to hear the plan). For example, tables that have many fields, you will need to load different ones for different queries and in general it is infeasible (exponential) to generate them all. Also, to get sharing you need to break the code up and now you're running the compiler multiple times which also seems bad. Given our focus on large-scale analysis, introducing optimization boundaries for code reuse seems like a bad trade off to me. A significant amount of analysis happens in the cloud where $HOME is ephemeral so you won't get savings between sessions. Finally, there are pipelines that are more standardized but it is my impression they are run on extremely large datasets (hours, overnight) in which case compilation speed isn't important. Finally, there's the complexity around locking that isn't easy and have real technical risk. A compiler cache potentially becomes more appealing in the context of an always-on service. There's no locking issue, and you can start to do things like speculative compilation (e.g. immediately start compiling the decoder (the full decoder? Hmm.) when a user opens the dataset.). I would say getting in a 3x decoder improvement is way more important than this. I would have punted it down the road and instrumented to estimate cache hit rates before building this out.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-410358596:294,optimiz,optimization,294,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-410358596,5,"['cache', 'load', 'optimiz']","['cache', 'load', 'optimization']"

No. More concurrency isn't going to increase the bandwidth from a single process if the network stack is full. Increasing the value of parallelism here has two benefits that I can see: (1) amortizing request overhead, which is already very small for 1MB requests. 2-way parallelism would probably be sufficient for that. (2) Increasing the parallelism on the server if the batch or database processes are single-process limited. For the latter, we can increase the parallelism but should correspondingly decrease the message size. My bandwidth numbers were the minimum required for things to work without back-off.

Performance,"> ToStream's invariant is that its children must be TIterable. Given this invariant, in boundary it is not safe to call ToArray on streamified when streamified.isInstanceOf[TStream] and node.typ.isInstanceOf[TArray], because this will miss cases (potentially) when node is a different TIterable, and likewise it is not safe to call ToArray on streamified when node.typ.isInstanceOf[TIterable], because we may inadvertently cast a non-array TIterable to TArray, and thereby break boundary's type invariance. So everywhere that we add a ToStream, we need to perform a check on the child: if it's a non-TArray TIterable, return it, else wrap in ToArray, unless we can be sure we never perform said wrap on a TIterable when streamify is called from boundary.

Performance,">> should be explicitly representable in the IR; >; > How would that work with MakeArray?. I have some thoughts on that, but I think it would require a bigger change to how we represent streams in the IR. One idea is to put stream producers and stream consumers on equal footing. Right now, a stream consumer is a node with a stream child that produces a non-stream value, e.g. `ArrayFor(stream, name, body)`. We could let stream consumers be values themselves, `ArrayFor(name, body)`, with other nodes for connecting producers with consumers, e.g. `RunStream(stream, ArrayFor(name, body))`. Then I think we would need two `MakeStream`s, one that can be unrolled, and one that can be zipped. The former just directly takes a consumer and produces a value (and can choose to duplicate the consumer code or wrap it in a method). The later constructs a stream producer, which can be freely used in zips, etc. It would definitely require some thought how to optimize such a representation (is there a normal form?). > I'm not sure I see that. If you don't duplicate the consumer, the push code is the same. The question is, do you use a variable + switch to track where you are in the MakeStream, or do you use the program counter via labels, where you get the latter from the former by code duplication. I think the easiest way to see it is to think about how you would zip two `MakeStream`s, both of which represent their state using the program counter. You could do it by statically fusing them into a single `MakeStream`, but what if it was something more complicated like `Zip(Map(MakeStream(...), ...), Filter(MakeStream(...), ...))`? You can't represent a compound state with a single program counter. At a higher level, you can only do the optimization of unrolling the `MakeStream` loop if that is the outermost loop in the generated code. A producer wanting to create the outermost loop is what I mean by a push stream.

Performance,"@akotlar Ok, so I finally managed to remove the internal requests. The asyncio learning curve was higher than I expected. The final product is a lot tighter than I expected.

Performance,"@cseed As I briefly mentioned in an email on Saturday, I moved notebook loading to a prefetched model. Data and page loading are decoupled: When one clicks on the Notebook link, routing to the page happens without waiting for data to come in from notebook-api.hail.is. If data is available, it is shown, else a loading indicator. To avoid loading screens, I call notebook-api.hail.is asynchronously immediately after a user hits app.hail.is, whether they're on the Notebook page or not. Therefore, typically a user will never see a Notebook page loading indicator, when they click from one page to Notebook (say they land on the home page: by the time they click on Notebook, the data is fetched, so no loading screen). Furthermore, web sockets keep that Notebook data up to date, again regardless of whether a user is on the Notebook page. So in all instances except when a user lands on Notebook directly, the time it takes to reach the Notebook page is << 16ms (seemingly ~3ms). A similar approach is now used for scorecard, except Scorecard will render data in the SSR phase (because I consider scorecard less important, and because most users of the web app won't need it), and will not prefetch data when on another page. However, clicking on ""Scorecard"" from another page will not cause routing to block while waiting for the https://scorecard.hail.is/json response; instead a loading indicator will be shown. In practice I find this preferable, because the GUI feels more responsive, and users get more feedback. This demonstrates the core benefit of universal rendering approaches, and how they can improve page loading times over even the leanest server-side rendered application.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5162#issuecomment-462221996:72,load,loading,72,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5162#issuecomment-462221996,8,['load'],['loading']

Scorecard page, before server-side caching takes 100ms on refresh, and 50ms on navigation from another page. This effectively means no overhead from my web implementation. Why? It takes ~50ms to return *anything* (including favicon.ico of 0 bytes), i.e 50ms is the time it takes from my computer to kubernetes and back, with no additional work done. We have 2 such requests currently when visiting app.hail.is/scorecard: one to to the web app server, one to scorecard/json. After caching (which is invalidated every 3 minutes), takes 50ms. So, if current scorecard.hail.is needed to hit a json endpoint to get data for its template, we would expect it to be no faster. Alternatively if we placed the json-generating function in the web-app's nodejs server it's response time would drop by ~50ms.; * I also am trying to use the internal DNS (SSR phase routes to http://scorecard/json, so should use kubernetes DNS; still take ~50ms to get the json... before caching).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5162#issuecomment-460071524:693,perform,performance,693,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5162#issuecomment-460071524,2,"['perform', 'response time']","['performance', 'response time']"

Performance,"@cseed, details below, exec summary: a series of confusions and confusing interfaces lead to cloud tools deployment issues. The resolution is to fix the deploy script to always deploy `cloudtools` for python 2 and 3 (because *it* works with both). Users will need `python2` somewhere on their PATH, but `gsutil` will guide them through that, i.e. not our problem. There is no problem except that I cannot approve my own PR. I noticed @catoverdrive wasn't actually assigned, so it wasn't in her scorecard queue. ---. There was a bit of confusion around this recently that @catoverdrive figured out. So, `gsutil` only supports `python2`, but it's happy to search through your path for a variety of binaries with suggestive names until it finds a valid python 2.x binary. `cloudtools` itself works with any version of python (there was a recent breaking change in the release of python 3.7, which broke cloud tools [but that's been resolved in an open PR](https://github.com/Nealelab/cloudtools/pull/91/files#diff-7decff7c08c5270a32982ea34483b8cbR11)). Now, wrt PYPI, @catoverdrive discovered that the version of python you use to run `setup.py bdist_wheel` determines which version of python is deployed. This is rather confusing and, since none (or many?) of us did not know this, we accidentally uploaded a variety of [cloud tools versions on pypi, as you've noted](https://pypi.org/simple/cloudtools/). There was some earlier confusion wherein I thought we should only support `python2`, but that was a mistake on my end. We should support both versions, and when the user tries to start a cluster, `gsutil` will provide an error message guiding them to install `python2`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4240#issuecomment-419912588:504,queue,queue,504,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/4240#issuecomment-419912588,1,['queue'],['queue']
Performance,"@cseed,. > The point isn't to save the few untars, the point is to make the general facilities performant for everyone. Basically, I think directory outputs are untenable in the current design unless they are very small, which is why you're doing all this for your use case, and the tar is still probably as good (if not better) in that case. Fix it for everyone's use case so nobody has to go through this in the future. I agree directory outputs with large file counts are untenable. Are you suggesting we do this at the batch level for any directory? That feels a bit opaque, because users may expect that if they specify their output is a directory that they can selectively download certain subdirectories. At the build.yaml level, I see a couple explicit options:; ```; outputs:; - from: /io/repo/hail/resources; to: /resources.tgz; codec: gzip; ```; and; ```; inputs:; - from: /resources.tgz; to: /io/resources; codec: gzip; ```; ?. There's also this, which irks me a bit because it's punny, but:; ```; outputs:; - from: /io/repo/hail/resources; to: /resources.tgz; ```; and. ```; inputs:; - from: /resources.tgz; to: /io/resources; extract:; - .; ```; ```; inputs:; - from: /resources.tgz; to: /io/resources; extract:; - foo; - bar; ```. A little bit my reaction to this is that we're creating a DSL that provides minor value relative to the user using `tar` in their `runImage` steps. E.g. build hail is explicit and not verbose:; ```; ...; tar czf test.tar.gz -C python test; tar czf resources.tar.gz -C src/test resources; tar czf data.tar.gz -C python/hail/docs data; tar czf www-src.tar.gz www; tar czf cluster-tests.tar.gz python/cluster-tests; ```; and `test_hail_java` is fine:; ```; ...; tar xzf resources.tar.gz -C src/test; ...; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7626#issuecomment-560470857:95,perform,performant,95,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7626#issuecomment-560470857,1,['perform'],['performant']

Performance,"@danking , I'm a bit stuck on how to proceed with the credential refreshing. Here's the layout of the problem:. 1. In normal Azure, we accept user-provided SAS tokens. Since they are user-provided, we have no way of obtaining new ones and the onus is on the user to obtain a SAS token for however long they expect to need to use it.; 2. This current design in Terra is to not make the user have to do that, because that seems annoying, and for terra-controlled ABS containers we have an endpoint we can hit to get a SAS token. Ok, but now we need to update our Azure FS infrastructure to refresh a credential if it expires. But, we use the azure client lib and don't control all http requests. For example, for `AzureStorageFS.open`, we call `downloader.readall()` if we want to load the whole file into memory. I went spelunking through their source and looks like `readall` mostly wraps a sequence of range reads, but regardless if we were to use that method we would have to catch credential expiration errors, reset credentials on the blob client and retry hoping that we didn't break any invariants -- I don't want to do that as I wouldn't trust a stream that encountered a non-transient error like that. It could be that getting rid of `downloader.readall` is the only thing we have to worry about, but it makes me uneasy not having control of the http requests we're making to ABS. Do you see a solution other than raking through our `aioazure.fs` and making sure that we only use ""quick"" methods and possibly retrying 401s? It just seems to me like we're going against the grain and even though it feels user-hostile the intention of SAS tokens are to have users own credential expiration.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13944#issuecomment-1930482715:779,load,load,779,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/13944#issuecomment-1930482715,1,['load'],['load']

Performance,"@danking @catoverdrive OK, I think it's ready for another review. I made the suggested changes, as well as the changes we talked about on Tuesday during check-in. There is a ton of indirection now, which might be confusing but is good for future expansion. The matrix and table metadata are now polymorphic `RelationalSpec`s and have a `name` field so new relational types can be added. Here is `sample.hmt/metadata.json.gz`:. ```; {; ""components"": {; ""cols"": {; ""rel_path"": ""cols\/rows"",; ""name"": ""RVDComponentSpec""; },; ""rows"": ...,; ""partition_counts"": {; ""counts"": [; 346; ],; ""name"": ""PartitionCountsComponentSpec""; }; },; ""matrix_type"": ...,; ""references_rel_path"": ""references"",; ""hail_version"": ""devel-e6ef439"",; ""file_version"": 65536,; ""name"": ""MatrixTableSpec""; }; ```. A MT has currently has five components: globals, cols, rows, entries and partition_counts. The first four are `RVDComponents`, the counts its own thing. I wanted to make the references a component, but they need to be loaded before the types are parse, so `RelationalSpec`s have a path to the references. Components are future expandable. The MT directory structure has metadata and four directories for each main component which is a Table directory. Those directory names are stored in the metadata, so they can be changed or even point elsewhere. A Table directory has two directories: globals and rows, which are RVDs. Again, the directories are stored in the metadata and I use that here: the globals RVD for rows and cols tables are the rows RVD of the globals table of the MT (if you can understand this sentence you've got a handle on this PR.). RVDs now store their own metadata, the RVDSpec. A sample rows RVD metadata for the rows table of an MT, `sample.hmt/rows/rows/metadata.json.gz` looks like:. ```; {; ""jRangeBounds"": [],; ""partFiles"": [; ""part-0""; ],; ""codecSpec"": ...,; ""orvdType"": ...,; ""name"": ""OrderedRVDSpec""; }; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/2858#issuecomment-364814856:998,load,loaded,998,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/2858#issuecomment-364814856,1,['load'],['loaded']

You'll notice that I made quite a substantial refactor in `ServiceBackend.scala` in an attempt to harmonize the scala backends a bit more. The rationale behind the refactor is I was having a hard time working with the various thunks passed around there. I saw them as a bit of poor-man's-object way to capture some state from the input file while keeping the `ServiceBackend` stateless. IMO there's no harm in keeping the `ServiceBackend` just as stateful as the other backends since it is single use. So I lifted a lot of that state into backend-creation time and created a harder delineation between which part of the input is for configuring the backend and which part is for the action being performed.

Performance,"@jjfarrell Thanks for sharing that! This is really interesting information. I'm quite surprised, but the evidence is pointing to there being a PC that largely separates those 8 replicates from the entire remaining dataset (!!!). I'm personally quite surprised that 8 samples out of thousands could pull this off, but that definitely seems to be the issue, given that the PCs from PC-AiR avoid the issue. Thank you so much for hunting this down! It's very valuable information for us. ### Next Steps . So, clearly we need a solution for users that have substantial numbers of related individuals in their source dataset (especially if the pedigrees are unknown). For your _particular_ use case, I can add a blurb to the docs that recommends removing known replicates _before_ PCA and then projecting them using the loadings from PCA. A longer term solution is to simply implement PC-AiR in hail. I skimmed the implementation section of the paper earlier this week and it looks very straightforward. It seems to boil down to using the KING estimator to estimate relatedness, compute PCA on unrelated individuals, project related individuals into unrelated PC space. Finally, we can use pc_relate to improve on our original estimates of relatedness from KING. The timeline for the latter thing is kind of unclear and a bit further out given some other work I need to finish. I'll get the documentation improvement in this week.

Performance,"@patrick-schultz, sorry, I missed this in-line comment. For the sake of unifying the discussion, I'll reply in PR comment so we can continue in one thread for both discussions (which I think are intimately related). > Right, but this is on the generic key_by path, and this is no longer an obvious optimization in all cases. I think my real question is: what is the new semantics for key_by? If I want to change my key from [A, B] to [B], then probably it will shuffle and choose balanced partitions, keeping roughly the same amount of parallelism, but if the existing partitioner satisfies a somewhat obscure condition that I don't have much control over, it will instead coalesce partitions.; >; > What if we gate this behavior behind a flag on TableKeyBy, and expose a way to opt in to the optimization in python?. This behavior is only accessible when TableKeyBy isSorted=true. If you've used a hidden field (only accessible through a) my newly exposed `_key_by_assert_sorted` or b) writing IR yourself) to assert that your dataset is already in the order of the new key, I'm certain you would *not* want to shuffle. Moreover, switching from `[A, B]` to `[B]` could very well reduce your effective parallelism even after a shuffle because keys are not permitted to be split across partitions. Consider a dataset keyed by `[Locus, Alleles, Gene]` with 10k partitions. If we re-key to `[Gene]` and we only have 1000 genes annotated, we'll lose partitions. In fact, in the 1:1 partition case (the case we're optimizing here) you *must* lose parallelism because each partition contains exactly one value for the key `B`.

Performance,A Hail value is data in a region (you don't know which region). we don't need to pass a region in `loadLength` because the region that the lazily decoded value might decode into isn't going to be that region anyway -- it must be the same region where the lazily decoded value is living.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/7826#issuecomment-575730831:99,load,loadLength,99,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/7826#issuecomment-575730831,1,['load'],['loadLength']
Performance,"A few observations:; - `Prop` is essentially a named `Gen[Unit]`; - The type of `Prop.forAll` is `Gen[T] -> (U -> Boolean) -> Prop`; - The first two observations suggest: `Prop.forAll` has type: `Gen[T] -> (U -> Boolean) -> Gen[Unit]`; - A `Gen[Unit]` is a bit artificial because the test framework halts execution (presumably with an exception) when a counter-example is found. I instead prefer that `Prop.forAll` has type: `Gen[T] -> (U -> Boolean) -> Gen[Boolean]`; - Now `Prop.forAll` has the same type as `Gen.flatMap[Boolean]`. It seems the difference between `forAll` and `flatMap` is that `forAll` conceptually preforms a product operation while `flatMap` performs a sampling. However, I think they are, in reality, the same operation: sampling. The implementation for `GenProp3` looks like:. ``` scala; for (i <- 0 until p.count) {; val v1 = g1(p); val v2 = g2(p); val v3 = g3(p); val r = f(v1, v2, v3); if (!r) {; println(s""! ${prefix}Falsified after $i passed tests.""); println(s""> ARG_0: $v1""); println(s""> ARG_1: $v2""); println(s""> ARG_2: $v3""); assert(r); }; }; ```. Which could be re-written as:. ``` scala; for (i <- 0 until p.count) {; (for (v1 <- g1; v2 <- g2; v3 <- g3) {; if (!r) {; println(s""! ${prefix}Falsified after $i passed tests.""); println(s""> ARG_0: $v1""); println(s""> ARG_1: $v2""); println(s""> ARG_2: $v3""); assert(r); }; })(p); }; ```. The primary difference between `flatMap` and `forAll` seems to be in error reporting. We can fix this by noting `Gen[T]` is currently a Reader monad on `Parameters`. If we add a ""forAll stack"" to `Parameters` we could implement `forAll` as:. ``` scala; def forAll[T,U](gt: Gen[T], gu: T -> Gen[U]): Gen[U] =; for (t <- gt; u <- local(pushQuantified(t), gu(t)) yield u. def pushQuantified(x: Any)(Parameters p): Paramters =; new Parameters(p.rng, p.size, p.count, (x :: p.quanitifed)); ```.

Performance,"Ah sorry, I forgot to update the original commit message as that's not actually correct. The optimization is that we don't need to iterate through all blobs until we find the exact blob matching our path name. The list operation returns all blobs that start with the prefix of that path. If we see a blob with a different name that is a child of our path `f'{path}/foo`, then we know it's a directory and don't need to iterate anymore (although it could be a file as well, but in Scala we don't currently throw errors on paths that are both files and directories, so we just choose the first we see). If we see a blob that matches the path exactly, then we know it's a file and stop iterating. The only reason we need to iterate through more than one blob is if there's blobs that are like `'{path}zzzzz/foo` or `'{path}szzzzz`. We need to ignore these as they don't provide any information on whether `{path}` is a file or directory. This is where `isChildOf` is needed because we need to make sure the blob is actually a child of the path such as `'{path}/file` and not `{path}zzzzz/file`.

Performance,"Ah, I understand. You're correct that pushing to the `cache` tag disassociates that tag with any image that was previously associated with it. That image is still in the registry though. I thought that was sufficient for the cache to work. (I was wrong, see below!). AFAICT, this change doesn't prevent PR tests from pushing to the `cache` tag. This change just makes the tests run by the CI-in-the-PR not overwrite the cache. Every image build for a PR (which is tested by default namespace CI) will still overwrite the cache tag. AFAICT, this; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo; ```; Will use as a cache source the `latest` tag in the `gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo` repository. It is *not* sufficient for an image to be present in the repository and untagged or with a different tag from `latest`. In particular, every push to the `cache` tag prevents us from using other images even though they are in the registry! For example, I pushed two images to `cache`:. ```; (base) # gcloud container images list-tags gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest; DIGEST TAGS TIMESTAMP; fb551d9bdb94 2022-06-10T14:16:39; afb4c5ad2d7b cache,latest 2022-06-10T14:15:55; ```. If I rebuild [1] the most recently pushed image with; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest:cache; ```; it succeeds in getting the cache. If I rebuild the other image with the same import-cache, it does not see that the (untagged) image is already there! . ---. This all suggests that all our attempts at image caching are failing terribly. Options:; 1. Only deploy builds push to a `:cache` tag, everyone uses that tag.; 2. List all the tags in the repository and include them all as --cache-from's (this doesn't actually work: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34715#issuecomment-425933774); 3.

Actually, awesome if it doesn't poll but uses, say, websockets, and the server watches the pod for a notification for k8s (or does this and also polls, which seems to be our standard pattern).

Performance,"At some point, we should think about how to improve the discoverability and machine-verifiability of our APIs. Currently the tightest type of job log is rather complex. If the performance is OK, I think we should move towards classes that define the request and response types of each call. ---. The main difference is `hail-pip-install` having `retry`. If pip exits with a non-zero exit code, we'll just rerun the command exactly, at most four more times. This mitigates missing retry logic in `pip` itself. For example, [this job](https://ci.hail.is/batches/167314/jobs/27) failed because pip encountered a connection reset while downloading a file. Ideally, pip would simply retry the download. Since we don't control the pip source code, I use a retry that treats all of pip as a black box. There's definitely a failure mode: if you specify a package that doesn't exist, pip will error five times in a row and take ~30 seconds before the retry logic gives up.

In both cases, regenerating that file (either in CI as part of the deploy.yaml target or on a cluster for `install-on-cluster`) could cause a dataproc cluster running with untested dependency versions even if the requirements.txt files are unchanged. I do, however, require that the pinned-requirements files be compatible using the same check we do in CI. I performed the following manual testing:; 1. Creating a dataproc cluster through `hailctl dataproc start`; 2. ssh'ing into said cluster, cloning this branch and running `make -C hail install-on-cluster` to completion; 3. Updating the requirements.txt file to something incompatible and successfully installing on cluster again with updated pinned requirements. However, I'm not sure I'm actually doing this right. I checked that in step 2 I was *not* regenerating any pinned-requirments files, but in step 3 make updated the pinned requirements without me telling it to, I'm guessing because of the wheel's dependence on `PY_FILES` and I changed the source under hail/python.

But that's still likely a bottleneck as phi requires computing and point-wise dividing two big gram matrices. I now write phi to disk and read it back in, which squares the parallelism up to the number of blocks in phi.

Performance,"Currently pruning dependencies, forking NextJS to remove poly fills for older browsers, and focusing on bundle size. Investigated using Inferno.js as a lighter alternative to React. Saves ~20-30KB bundle size, and is somewhat faster. However, main Inferno dev moved to React core team, and React is focusing on the optimizations present in Inferno for 2019 (DOM: move to native events where possible), as well as introducing optimizations not found in Inferno (compile time targets: initially inlining, future maybe web assembly binaries; move rendering work to separate thread / concurrent rendering). Furthermore, React ecosystem is orders of magnitude larger, so we can save a huge amount of dev time by avoiding Inferno (N modules * time to develop bespoke module avg), and have greater likelihood of LTS. Notably, I realized that most of my bundle size was coming from inefficient bundling of Material UI and due to Apollo's insanely large graphQL bundle. Removing these now. Lastly, React is actually very efficient. jQuery is ~31.1KB minified. React is 3KB, while React DOM is 33.8KB. In 2019 React DOM will shrink. In any case, given that React is both faster than jQuery, dramatically simplifies development, and introduces development structure, 4KB cost is imo worth it.

Performance,"Deploy commits don't need to cleanup which adds some latency to this PR. We should probably use xargs -P4 to delete instances 4-way parallel. This PR is ~46 minutes, including all the cleanup time, where as deploys are 46 minutes *without the cleanup time*. Notice two things: (1) the service backend is again the critical path (2) some local backend tests took quite a while to get scheduled. Seems fishy to me that it took ~16 minutes to find a core for the local backend tests to run on. Anyway, seems good to use more fine-grained parallelism.

Performance,"Do you mean when showing the log in the UI or the final upload to blob storage?. I think that's a great idea for the UI, where we show a truncated view in the page and the download button provides a way to stream the log file without loading it into memory on the front-end. In terms of the final upload, I'm a little wary about making a breaking change like that. It's probably true that if you're spewing tons of logs as a user you probably want to not do that. But if we move later to hosting logs in user-provided buckets instead of our own bucket there's no reason why they shouldn't be able to write large logs if they want to.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/12852#issuecomment-1570846197:234,load,loading,234,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/12852#issuecomment-1570846197,1,['load'],['loading']

Performance,"EDIT: The problem in this message is still valid, but the fix described here was replaced following the conversation with Tim. Ok, second pruning bug fixed. This commit illustrates the change, probably worth looking at in isolation: https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/9578/commits/f4ce01d59a56bef7496490145e66d274f51139e6. Essentially, the problem was that we were rebuilding an `InsertFields(child, newFields, _)` node with a requested type of empty struct. The old rebuilding strategy handled this by recursively rebuilding the `child` node, then filtering `newFields` to include only those in the requested type. However, if the `child` node can't be filtered (say it's a `Ref` of a certain type), and one of the fields being inserted is overwriting a field in the child, you need to make sure you do the overwriting so the typing works out. Happy to explain more if this is unclear. I also added an optimization to just drop the whole `InsertFields` if the requested type is the empty struct, not sure if that's good pruning manners though. .

Performance,"First, @cristinaluengoagullo, thank you for your contribution! This is awesome. Second, I think this PR will need a little work before it can go in. Let me describe the situation:. We have now stopped work on Hail 0.1 and are now making only critical bug fixes. I think we can accept small feature additions, but we're optimizing for stability over features now. All new development has moved to master/0.2 beta. If you do make changes to 0.1, they should be forward ported to 0.2 if you want them to be carried forward. In addition, there are two problems with your PR:. 1. It is quite large. We prefer contributions to be single conceptual units. For example, a change to VEP should be separate from additions to the function registry. 2. The diff is somewhat confusing and I'm not 100% sure what is going on. It appears to include a large number of our own changes, it looks like from this commit: https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3172/commits/e6f0b7f3a854f0fd64857876ab04375e570ba09f. However, given that the commit is under your name with a new commit message, I can't tell where those changes originated. Also, at least some (all?) of those changes already appear in 0.1, so I'm not sure why Github is displaying them, for example: https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3172/files#diff-f11d07953ac5cd8bd8d4d3fd135a3efbR11. I think squashing your changes (and just your changes) and rebasing them onto the current 0.1 HEAD will fix the problem. Then we can take a closer look at the changes. Finally, it looks like your changed the VEP schema because you're invoking it with extra plugins. I think that's a no-go for us, but you could modify the VEP command (through an argument or in the properties file) to specify an alternate schema.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3172#issuecomment-377559347:319,optimiz,optimizing,319,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3172#issuecomment-377559347,1,['optimiz'],['optimizing']

Performance,"For https://github.com/broadinstitute/hail/issues/604, I don't like this fix. I did some research on recommended line lengths, for example:. http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/13724/recommended-column-width-for-text-reading-digital-vs-printed. and the consensus seems that 50-80 is good, and maybe as high as 95. With 45em, the documentation text had a width of around 88 characters. I think that's basically perfect. I think the complaint is about information density and other parts of the layout, not the blocks of text (which are relatively rare). For example, even with this change, tables (see Hadoop Glob Patterns) are quite narrow. The TOC is narrow and takes up a huge amount of vertical space. Etc. It might be reasonable to make the code examples wider than the rest of the text. Let's address the other layout issues and then see if this is still a problem/complaint. For https://github.com/broadinstitute/hail/issues/605, genius observation, I think you're totally right. I did a little research on defer. It seems like the script runs after the DOM is parsed. But since loading the HTML pages are themselves asynchronous, I don't think that's enough of a guarantee that the content with equations will be loaded. Potential solution: call a callback after the loads complete to load the JSON and MathJax. Here's an example on using `$.when` to run a callback after multiple loads:. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17609084/jquery-callback-after-multiple-functions. Then load the JSON, build the docs, and finally load MathJax. To load JS from JS, use jQuery `$.getScript` or build a DOM script element directly, for example:. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/950087/how-to-include-a-javascript-file-in-another-javascript-file. I think eventually we'll want to include the HTML fragments into a single page at build time.

Performance,"For the partitioning algorithm, I updated the test to confirm that all the individuals in the unrelated set are mutually unrelated. For PC-AiR, I updated the test to compare the loadings to PCA on just the unrelated individuals. The loadings are NumPy close. The scores are slightly different though because they are calculated differently. When there are related individuals, the scores are calculated by multiplying the loadings and the standardized genotypes. When there are no related individuals, the scores are calculated by multiplying the columns of the appropriate singular matrix with the eigenvalues. So for the scores, I just add a regression test. (In my testing, I observed that most of the scores were less than 1% different. However, there were a few differences that were larger around 20% or 30%.

Removed all GraphQL libraries, besides graphql-tag, which I like, because 1) simple hash-based cache: no need to walk complex graph to normalize cache, because in most cases I'm perfectly fine with not re-using cache across different queries (that may have some shared fields). Apollo does something ""smarter"", but much slower: walks a query, checks that the requested fields for a node are the same, and that the node's id is the same, as some other query. 2) no runtime validation of query shape via graphql-tag...uses simple template strings, which are free. We don't care about schema validation in the client...because the server will error when schema is invalid. This should be compile time validated instead, in this case via integration tests. Also removed react-icons... I was going to use this in place of material-design-icons, because I thought loading the full font, when I needed only a few icons, would be unnecessarily expensive. It turns out that I cannot find a library where a single icon import (react-icons or MaterialUI) is smaller than Google's entire material design font: a single font (there are several needed to cover all icons) is ~500B. A single react-icons icon is ~2KB on dev (production may be smaller due to tree shaking). Also, am opposed to CSS-in-JS: slower, worse tooling, larger. Benefits are dynamic selectors, which are really no advantage that I can see (without them can still dynamically apply classes, as in the yee ol days of pleb vanilla js).

Performance,"Gotcha, thanks, the trouble with reading your reply on the go. I had assumed you contributed to both from your reply. Glad to hear you're taking aiohttp performance seriously. Regarding flow-control, yep, that pr was merged https://github.com/huge-success/sanic/pull/1179. I haven't seen any further conversations from you or Sanic devs on the issue.; * It's not just on master, it's in 0.8. Part of my concerns over Sanic came from reading your post @ https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/876msl/sanic_python_web_server_thats_written_to_die_fast/ ; this now seems outdated, and it would be interesting to hear the reply of a Sanic contributor. Re: ""The last cherry: Sanic has super fast URL router because it caches matching results. The feature is extremely useful for getting awesome numbers with `wrk` tool but in real life URL paths for server usually not constant. URLs like `/users/{userid}` don't fit in cache well :)""; - Surely simple (typical-use, i.e /path or /path/<param>) pattern matching isn't a large performance constraint. I would be surprised if this were a bottleneck in either Sanic or aiohttp.; - If aiohttp is bottlenecked by this, and isn't caching matches, why not? The most common route is say /. Edit: To be clear, the bench mentioned above used 1 worker for Sanic and aiohttp, both using uvloop. Bench attached.

Performance,"Great questions. The larger change here is that we're trying to decouple the Python front end from Scala/Java. Therefore, instead of calling directly into Python (e.g. getReferenceGenome), we're constructing a MatrixRead IR, which can either be passed to a service (ServiceBackend) or passed to Java as we did before (SparkBackend). I should also remark, py4j is incredibly slow, so batching calls to Python greatly improves performance in the current setup. So, for example, building an IR in Python, serializing it and parsing on Java is much faster than a series of py4j calls that builds the corresponding objects on the Java side one at a time. Some functions which used to be called from Python like importBgens are no longer used, but are still used by the Scala tests. Those got moved to TestUtils and are being phased out.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5150#issuecomment-456682522:425,perform,performance,425,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5150#issuecomment-456682522,1,['perform'],['performance']

Performance,"Hey @anh151 !. I'm sorry you're having trouble with Hail. The message ""Container killed on request. Exit code is 137"" comes from Apache Spark, our underlying distributed compute framework. It indicates that the worker machines have insufficient RAM. In general, using worker machines with higher RAM-to-core ratios will help. If you're on GCP, try the n1-highmem family. Some other suggestions:. 1. Hail is a ""lazy"" system. Your entire pipeline is executed, from the beginning, when you run ""export"" or ""write"". That means that Hail has to do all of that work at once. You can ease the memory pressure by performing less operations at once, by writing an intermediate file (and reading back in and proceeding with it).; 2. We recommend against directly exporting from a complex operation (like group-by-aggregate). Instead, grab the cols table and write it to Hail's fast, binary, parallel format: `.cols().select('field_of_interest').write('my-cols.ht')`. Then read that table and export that: `hl.read_table('my-cols.ht').field_of_interest.export(...)`. Exporting to a text file requires more memory because we have to construct ASCII strings.; 3. Always use a compressed export: `.export('foo.tsv.bgz')` or `hl.export_vcf(..., 'foo.vcf.bgz')`. This won't help your memory problem, but you can avoid parsing strings to create loci by constructing an `hl.Locus` which is the Python-side representation of loci (`hl.locus` is the inside-Hail representation):; ```python3; def create_intervals(data):; return [; hl.Locus(chromosome, start, reference_genome=""GRCh38""); for i, (chromosome, start) in data[[""CHROM"", ""POS""]].iterrows(); ]; ```.

Performance,"Hey @illusional ! Sorry for the massive latency. OK, so, big apologies are in order, I totally lead you astray by mentioning the makefile. The Makefile *is* the source of hail version truth, but invoking the makefile inside an image build step feels wrong to me. Each step creates a layer which inflates the image sizes. Hail's images are already too big!. I took your commits and added one of my own that snags the version from the `copy_files` build step. Because I wanted `service_base_image` to depend on `copy_files`, I had to move the whole step after `copy_files`. This is a limitation in build.yaml: a step must appear *after* steps on which it depends. I also had to move `check_services` for the same reason: it depends on `service_base_image`. File dependencies in build.yaml work like this:; 1. For runImage steps, you can only copy out-of or copy into `/io` (the reasoning is a bit complicated and somewhat historical).; 2. For buildImage steps, you can copy out-of or copy into `/`; 3. the `to` of an `output` specifies a file path in a ""filesystem"" that another step can access if it `dependsOn` the outputting step; 4. the `from` of an `input` specifies a file path in the aforementioned ""filesystem""; the filesystem contains all `outputs` from steps in the inputting step's `dependsOn` clause. We also have a `docker/Makefile` which is an emergency manual build system. I update that so that `hail_version` appears in the root of the docker context. The `service-base` uses the entire repository as its docker context, so I place hail_version at the root of the repository. I moved the `version` function from `hailtop.hailctl` into `hailtop`. It seems broadly useful and isn't specific to hailctl in anyway. Your concern about loading from pkg_resources repeated seems well-founded, so I went ahead and loaded the hail_version at package import time. This seems likely to ensure we learn about a missing hail_version file as early as possible (presumably at service start-time).

Performance,"Hey @jjfarrell,. Awesome! Thanks for the continued debugging support! So the `scores_expr` argument to [`hl.methods.pc_relate`](https://hail.is/docs/devel/methods/genetics.html?highlight=pc_relate#hail.methods.pc_relate) should be a numeric array. Every row must have the same length. All the scores must be non-missing. You can load a TSV into hail with [`hl.import_table`](https://hail.is/docs/devel/methods/impex.html?highlight=import_table#hail.methods.import_table). So in your case you probably want:; ```python; import hail as hl; scores = hl.import_table('/path/to/foo.tsv', impute=True); scores = scores.key_by('SampleId'); scores = scores.transmute(scores=[scores.PC1, scores.PC2, ..., scores.PC10]); dataset = # ...; rel = hl.pc_relate(; dataset.GT,; 0.02, ; scores_expr=scores[dataset.col_key].scores,; min_kinship=0.1); ```; ---; > Is it sorted by SampleId or indexed somehow?. So, the expression `scores_table[dataset.col_key]` indexes your TSV (loaded into Hail as a Table) by the column key of your dataset (the sample id). For this expression to make sense you have to define a key on your scores_table. I did that with `.key_by('SampleId')`. Since your `col_key` is also (I assume) a sample id they will be matched up as you expect. If the sample ids were mangled or changed by one of the tools that were used to generate the TSV, you'll need to un-mangle them, which you can, of course, use Hail to do as well, using something like `scores.key_by(scores.sample_id[0:10])` to take the first ten characters.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/3490#issuecomment-390759209:329,load,load,329,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/3490#issuecomment-390759209,2,['load'],"['load', 'loaded']"

Performance,"Hi @danking, thanks for this. On the topic of asserts, there are really two interacting issues:. 1. Asserts are intended to ensure invariants, i.e. conditions that should always be true. In correct code, assertions should never raise so disabling them should have no consequences at runtime. In practice, however, they are often casually used to catch value errors, which can be expected to occur if a user-facing method receives bad/nonsensical inputs (e.g. here: https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/1940547d35ddddb084ad52684e36153c1e03a331/hail/python/hailtop/hailctl/dataproc/diagnose.py#L62); 2. Python's language design allows anyone calling your code to disable asserts for optimization purposes, because disabling asserts should never change the semantics of the program. Putting these two features together, you can arrive at a situation where a user thinks they're turning off asserts (which should never raise anyway) and instead stops catching value errors (whose absence can never be guaranteed). All that said, if the final answer is: ""if you invoke `-O` you deserve what's coming"", I'm happy to drop it :). Thanks for taking a look at the example. If I understand you correctly, it sounds like I passed the wrong inputs to the function, in which case it might be clearer to raise a ValueError instead of an AssertionError in the end. On a closer look, it seems like most of the instances of `assert(x, y)` are actually in scala code-- my mistake.

Performance,"I have a implemented a highly concurrent Python asyncio filesystem that supports GCS and the local file system (and soon S3). It is my intention to ultimately replace the hadoop_* functions with this. The new thing feels pretty fast: copy benchmarks 2-5x faster than gsutil for example, esp. when working with lots of files. Some remarks:; - It is designed to do the minimal number of system calls/API calls per operation so there is serial loops like this anywhere in the code.; - Our short term goal is to use this for the input/output steps in Batch.; - It doesn't support Hadoop (and I'm not super exciting about maintaining that).; - Some things will be much faster because no round trip the JVM. ; - The interface is fully async, so we'll need to build some wrappers if you want a synchronous interface. The async interface will get you concurrency within operations (copy, rmtree), the sync interface only gets you currency within operations.; - The list files operation doesn't support globbing yet.; - There are no docs yet.; - Compared to Hadoop/POSIX, the interface is slightly lower level but it was designed to map well onto the filesystems we want to support. There is no `stat`, for example, but is statfile (which requires the input to be a file) and listfiles (which requires it to be a directory), although we could build that.; - I'd say the code is beta and not quite completely solid but getting close.

Performance,"I think this PR is just about as good as it's going to get for now. From looking at the Grafana API metrics, I think I was hitting the maximum scheduler throughput. The get running cancellable jobs is around 40ms each call for 5000 jobs while the getting the job head queue is 123ms. If the 40ms becomes a problem, then we can pull less records (see explanation below) or we can not do a json array agg and figure out the regions using bit shifting. When we did the load tests yesterday getting the job head queue was around 1-2 seconds with us each having 20k records. I think we just have to keep an eye on it. I did some further optimization of the scheduler by allowing it to pull up to 10000 jobs from the database to try and schedule before it hits its fair share of jobs scheduled. This helps a lot with efficiency to use the existing capacity if there are jobs further down the queue that are schedulable. I know it's a bit of a departure from what we've done in the past, but I think since we're going in order of fair share now and pulling more jobs from the database isn't that expensive, then this is fine. Happy to make this number 1000 even. 300 was too small though.

Performance,"I think we should find a time to discuss this in person if the following explanation doesn't make sense. . Right now, for small batches, we send one REST request to the server to both create the batch and create the jobs. However, if we want one REST request for an update (ideal for the query service and low latency jobs?), we have to use relative job ids because (1) we don't know the absolute start index of the jobs until we've gotten the start id of the update back from the server and (2) the job dependencies can be a mix of known job ids that have already been previously submitted in a previous creation/update. The negative job IDs are a way to deal with a mix of relative ids within an update and known, submitted job ids. We can simplify things if we require all updates make two requests to the server to (1) get the start id and establish the update and then (2) submit new jobs with all absolute job IDs. I'd have to make sure this will actually simplify things because I also ran into a bifurcation in how the job IDs are handled in `BatchBuilder.create_job()`. We currently populate the spec with a job id before we've made any requests to the server. We need to know how many total jobs there are before we can figure out the job ids because the API for creating a new update requires reserving a block of job IDs which then returns the start id. This complexity is because we allow multiple updates to occur simultaneously to a batch.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12010#issuecomment-1215919856:310,latency,latency,310,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12010#issuecomment-1215919856,1,['latency'],['latency']

When we create an update from a Batch that already existed perhaps in a different process, we don't have the attributes and token. I made a contract where `commit_update` always returns the token and attributes regardless of whether the BatchBuilder already has that infromation. However, we could also get that information available lazily and cache the result. In addition, the `n_jobs` returned to the client are the number of jobs that are committed and not the same as the `n_jobs` in the batches table. Things to do before merging:; 1. Get rid of the batch updates additions to the UI2. ; 2. Double check the GCP LogsExplorer to make sure there are no silent error messages especially with regards to cancellation.; 3. Have @danking look over the SQL stored procedure for `commit_batch_update` to make sure that query is going to perform as good as what is possible given the complexity of the check.; 4. Run a test batch with the old client (I just checked out the current version of main). You need to make sure both create and create-fast are accounted for and succeed. I've been using the following script to make sure we're using the slow path in addition to the fast path with a regular small test job:. ```python3; from hailtop.batch import ServiceBackend, Batch; import secrets. backend = ServiceBackend(billing_project='hail'); b = Batch(backend=backend); # 8 * 256 * 1024 = 2 MiB > 1 MiB max bunch size; for i in range(8):; j1 = b.new_job(); long_str = secrets.token_urlsafe(256 * 1024); j1.command(f'echo ""{long_str}"" > /dev/null'); batch = b.run(); ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12010#issuecomment-1226043347:463,cache,cache,463,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12010#issuecomment-1226043347,2,"['cache', 'perform']","['cache', 'perform']"

Performance,"I've removed the Python `tempfile` approach in favor of adding `new_local_temp_file` to utils and a corresponding function to HailContext in Scala, which currently hardcodes `file:///temp` as the local temp directory. It may be more natural to have a localTmpDir on HailContext like we have tmpDir. ; I see there is a notion of local temp files on TempDir on the Scala side, but it doesn't seem to be used on the Python side. I also don't see if/where we wipe temp files on exit. In any case, I've tested that now it all works nicely on GCP, so ready for feedback/review. I think factoring through `tofile` and `fromfile` is useful for wider interoperability for the same reason that NumPy exposes them, but it's also good if you don’t want to actually load the NumPy array into driver memory but just save it to read/copy later, or to load it multiple time without recomputing the BlockMatrix.

Performance,"In Hail, we need to know the dataset schema statically (e.g. when run `import_vcf` before you process the data). There are two ways to do it: use the header or impute. Impute means scanning the entire dataset (it may be the very last variant has a field that appears nowhere else in the file). Even more, you need to scan all the genotypes to determine the the types since types aren't declared outside of the header. We have an impute option for loading TSVs, but not for VCFs.

Performance,"In particular, isn't it possible that you have the n-1th and nth job racing to complete. Everyone else is already done. Call the n-1th job's transaction T1 and the nth job's transaction T2. Both race down to this statement in MJC:; ```; UPDATE batches; SET time_completed = new_timestamp,; `state` = 'complete'; WHERE id = in_batch_id AND n_completed = batches.n_jobs;; ```. That will now need to have a sum(n_completed) over all tokens. The isolation level is repeatable read. Assume T1 and T2 generate non equal tokens. T1 and T2 may both snapshot the state of the database before either T1 or T2 executes. T1 and T2 will necessarily see the changes they've made (which affect distinct rows because they have distinct tokens), but neither is required to see the changes the other has made. I think the only way to guarantee that at least one of T1 or T2 sees the database with sum(n_completed) == n_jobs is for both of them to LOCK IN SHARE MODE when doing the sum(n_completed). That will cause lock contention. Maybe that's OK? In the worst case you could have this happen:. 1. Job 1 executes all the way to just before the sum(n_completed).; 2. Job 2 executes all the way to modifying the volatile state.; 3. Job 1 blocks waiting for Job 2 to modify the volatile state.; 4. Job 3 executes all the way to modifying the volatile state.; 5. Job 1 and 2 now wait for Job 3 to modifying the volatile state.; 6. ...; 7. Job 1, 2, 3, n-1 now all wait for Job n to modify the volatile state.; 8.

Performance,"Just starting to explore this PR. I compared this in-progress CI run to 7126798 (from #12737). The time to service backend starting is ~7 minutes. In the other PR, its ~8 minutes. I suppose that's because this PR isn't hitting any caches, right?. Hmm, it also seems like the critical path to the service backend test is through `build_hail_jar_and_wheel_only`.

Performance,"Keeping in mind Cotton's queries last week, researched and found much lighter alternative to ExprsesJS for the server api. A few years ago, Express had low impact on node performance; it has become bloated. Found a light (~200 LOC) ""framework"" called Polka, that is small enough to maintain ourselves. It mainly adds light route-matching capabilities, to avoid repeating boilerplate when writing the Node server. Easy to follow. It's also the fastest ""framework"" available, outside of C/Go/Rust. Matches Falcon, and allows 1 language for server/web. (Also Node has a far larger ecosystem).; * https://github.com/the-benchmarker/web-frameworks ; * Polka also nearly compatible with Express's middleware api, so many existing packages are either directly usable, or with minor modifications.

Performance,"More timing info. I tried a QR / TriSolve approach for `fit` as well and it performed worse so removed it. I believe this because solving tiny systems (dimension number of covariates) is dwarfed by time spent working with vectors and matrices with primary dimension the number of samples (as in QR), and because BLAS3 matrix multiplication is fast. I also checked that upping to 8 covariates didn't balance things out. It didn't. The fancy approach basically trades X.t * X and generic k-dim solve for a QR on X and triangular k-dim solve...better for larger k and smaller n. ```; Standard. 2 cov; Lin 7s; Score 54.5s; LRT 93s; Wald 90s. 2 cov, QR / TriSolve; Lin 7.42s; Score 53.6s, 53.1s; LRT 2m06s, 1m59s; Wald 1m53s, 1m54s. 8 cov; Lin 7.16s; Score 59.1s; LRT 2m25s, 2m20s, 2m26s; Wald 2m27s, 2m27s, 2m25s. 8 cov, QR / TriSolve; Lin 7.76s; Score 52.7s; LRT 3m30s; Wald 3m26s; ```. For Firth, since I'm using QR anyway, may as will use TriSolve (though the timing is not particularly effected even with 8 covariates):. ```; 2 cov:; Firth 5m 10s, 4m55s, 5m7s. 8 cov:; Firth 10m37s, 10m50s, 10m28s; ```. For reference, here's the core logic of the QR approach. This corresponds to another version of LogisticRegressionFit where I tried to reduce unnecessary computation, see below. ```; while (!converged && !exploded && iter <= maxIter) {; try {; val mu = sigmoid(X * b); val sqrtW = sqrt(mu :* (1d - mu)); val QR = qr.reduced(X(::, *) :* sqrtW). deltaB = TriSolve(QR.r, QR.q.t * ((y - mu) :/ sqrtW)). if (max(abs(deltaB)) < tol) {; converged = true; if (computeScoreR) {; optScore = Some(X.t * (y - mu)); optR = Some(QR.r); }; if (computeSe) {; val invR = inv(QR.r) // could speed up inverting as upper triangular, or avoid altogether as 1 / se(-1) = fit.fisherSqrt(-1, -1); optSe = Some(norm(invR(*, ::))); }; if (computeLogLkld); optLogLkhd = Some(sum(breeze.numerics.log((y :* mu) + ((1d - y) :* (1d - mu))))); } else {; iter += 1; b += deltaB; }; }; ```. ```; case class LogisticRegressionFit(; ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/1375#issuecomment-279532833:76,perform,performed,76,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/1375#issuecomment-279532833,1,['perform'],['performed']

Performance,"Ok, so Cotton's new thing means emitting separate methods by hand is not a thing we do anymore. But there are two factors hurting the benchmark. . One is that the benchmark is hiding the fact that we are spending ~25 seconds serializing and de-serializing JSON for this ndarray. So the real comparison is more like 55 seconds vs 75 seconds, which is a roughly 25% speed improvement. . The other is that `hl.nd.ones` is just an alias for `hl.nd.array(hl.range(shape_product)).map(lambda x: 1).reshape((n_rows, n_cols))`. This is going to create a bunch of row major data, copy it to column major in a pretty cache inefficient way during the reshape, then do the additions. So that's eating some of the time too.

Performance,"On std::unique_ptr, I may be a contrarian, but I don't care what the ""C++ community"" thinks about it.; If you buy into using std::unique_ptr<T>, then everyone who writes or reads the code has to get ; their head around the massively confusing and counter-intuitive concept of move semantics (a ; form of assignment which modifies the source) *and* the somewhat bizarre terminology and syntax; used to express that in C++. And then you get into a whole host of associated design decisions (I'm holding this as a unique_ptr,; but I want to pass it to a function - should I pass it as a raw pointer ? a raw reference ? a reference; to the unique_ptr ?). . I would be fine with that extra learning curve and complexity if unique_ptr<T> solved a difficult; problem. But - by definition! - it doesn't.

Performance,"One obvious point of optimization that Dan already identified is the way we were keying our data is causing full shuffles, as we were keying the data by a string variant ID in the form `1-32683987-ACTCTT-A` instead of locus-allele. Changing back to keying on locus-allele fixes this issue for our more straightforward searches, but we have a search that looks for pairs of possible compound heterozygous variants in the same gene, and that still is resulting in 2 full shuffles. I'm a little at a loss for how to fix this, because we are grouping by an unsorted field so I'm not sure how to prevent us from working with an unsorted dataset.

For one thing, this ensures that PC-AiR always returns results in the same form as normal PCA. More importantly, `_hwe_normalized_blanczos` performs the SVD using a ""tall-skinny matrix"" representation, which is just a table of matrices (2d ndarrays). This is more efficient than using block matrices for several reasons that aren't directly relevant here. The result of the SVD is computed as local numpy ndarrays. Given these forms of the data, projecting the related sampled onto the computed PCs should be straightforward and efficient.

Performance,"Ready for another look. I had to modify the classes some to make it work, particularly for getting the `type` out of the test. Now the type is with the Test rather than the TestResult, perhaps you see a better way?. Related notes, mostly relevant to future PRs once we have some feedback and a sense of performance:. I think LogisticRegressionNullFit should be a separate class, as it plays a conceptually and practically different role. I don't want to attach vectors of length nSamples (like mu) to each LogisticRegressionFit output, even though they would speed up the score test and first iteration of fitting per variant to not recompute them for every variant. I did put some of this efficiency in the score test (only computing the extra coordinate of score and row / column of fisher per variant). df would also then go away for LogisticRegressionFit, but I'd add the diagonal of its inverse for use in Wald (see below). The model fit function would then take a LogisticRegressionNullFit to use in the first iteration. The bigger future gains will come from not computing or inverting the Fisher matrix at all in the iteration, but rather using QR magic. val sqrtW = sqrt(mu :\* (1d - mu)); val QR = qr.reduced(X(::, _) :_ sqrtW); solve QR.R \* deltaB = QR.Q.t \* (y - mu) with R upper triangular (need to wrap lapack function). for Wald: return diagonal of inverse as well, namely diagonal of inv(R)^T \* inv(R), rather than inverting fisher again. for Score, this version of this may be faster:; val sqrtW = sqrt(mu :\* (1d - mu)); val Qty0 = qr.reduced.justQ(X(::, _) :_ sqrtW).t \* ((y - mu) :/ sqrtW); val chi2 = Qty0 dot Qty0. for Firth, modify score using:; val QQ = QR.Q :\* QR.Q; val h = sum(QQ(*, ::))",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/585#issuecomment-241153168:303,perform,performance,303,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/585#issuecomment-241153168,1,['perform'],['performance']

Performance,"Replying to cseed on code-reuse and cacheing/locking. a) Even with whole-stage codegen, there's a possibility that during development a user; will be tweaking a query in ways which don't change all the stages. And in that case the re-use; would give hits on some stages. The plan is not really to aim at structuring things to get a; high level of re-use, but just to opportunistically exploit re-use which happens to occur -; e.g. if the early stages of an analysis involve reading an existing file and filtering in various; ways, then that may not be changed at all by changes to what happen in the real analysis; after the filtering. And this is also influenced by the medium-term goal of having a Hail service; which (amongst other things) can do simple analyses on small data in under ten seconds - in; that realm compilation time could become a critical factor as a serial bottleneck. [The place where persistent cacheing of compiled files helps most of all is in testing,; where you really are running the exact same queries over and over again on the same; small datasets, and in many cases after making small changes which only affect a few; of the queries]. b) We may actually have some version of the locking problem even if we don't try to reuse the files -; since we have several workers on a node, and possibly a master as well, all needing to put code; into a file (or wait for someone else to populate the file) so that they can load it. Depending on ; precisely how Spark manages things (which I wouldn't want to depend on too much anyway). In fact it's essential that all the workers share the same DLL file, because otherwise they'd be; trying to load multiple DLL's defining the same symbols. That aspect of it could be handled by; putting the files into a per-process directory and using in-memory (std::mutex) synchronization.; But y'know, given that we have to write the DLL's out, it just seemed natural to let them persist; (and until debugging it on MacOS, I thought I could m",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-412742385:36,cache,cacheing,36,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-412742385,2,"['bottleneck', 'cache']","['bottleneck', 'cacheing']"

However, see the second answer in the link above: gcc improves optimization by assuming the undefined behavior cannot happen. So our options seem to be:. 1. Leave this change, but change Memory.malloc to allocate at least one byte (guaranteeing it never returns 0). 2. Revert this change, and assume memcpy with 0 length is safe and weaken the memcpy check. 3.

Performance,"So I'm going to insist on the classical loop interface I described above, since it is strictly more powerful than the interfaces you've proposed. I don't have a strong feeling if you want to also add a Python-inspired while loop (although I personally would find the similarities misleading given the required differences, I understand others might feel differently). Your while loop should be naturally implementable in terms of mine, so I also suggest we focus on that first. Giving each loop a name seems natural. Apart from the wrapping issue (the greatest existential threat our generation faces) I don't see any problem calling an outer loop from an inner loop. Is Patrick's proposal for extra types written up anywhere? I don't like the idea of complicating the type hierarchy for internal bookkeeping like this. So I'm going to remark that in the code generator it is often natural to build data structures to aid the organization of the code generator, and those data structures need not need to be types/IRs. Given that Recur has to be in tail position, and you know exactly when you're existing the loop (branches that don't contain recur nodes). So the compilation looks like:. ```; set initial loop variables; # fall through into loop; Lloop:; ...; # recur; loop variables = new values; goto Lloop; Lan_exit_branch:; result = compile(branch); goto Lafter; Lanother_exit_branch:; result = compile(other_branch); goto Lafter; Lafter:; use result ...; ```. What I would do is ""peel"" off the ifs and lets (anything else?) that can sit in tail position and build a separate data structure for those nodes which I then traverse to emit the above code. Using the stream interface seems wrong to me also. What's the type of the stream the loop turns into? Since loops carry multiple values (by design), memory allocating these to create a tuple stream is going to be a performance non-starter. I'll comment more once I've looked over the code.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7614#issuecomment-558699125:1874,perform,performance,1874,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7614#issuecomment-558699125,1,['perform'],['performance']
Performance,"So I'm moderately unhappy with this for various reasons, and almost didn't PR it. We don't generally respect IR identity (e.g. optimize copies everything), so I'm not sure how useful memoizing partition counts on the IR actually is. We could try to carry this information forward inside copy. In that cases that (MatrixIR child) has the same partition counts as child, we can actually push the computed partition counts down into child. But all of this is getting pretty complicated ... just to optimize count? I wonder if it is worth it. Yes, Count and PartitionCounts have different requirements. I think we either need both, or we need to recognize in (Sum (PartitionCounts child)) that child doesn't need to preserve order. (An analysis pass that determines which IR need to preserve order in general will be better than determining this syntactically from context with a rule like (Count (Unkey child)).

I'm not opposed to adding tokens to the batches_n_jobs_in_complete_states table, but I'm not sure why this is related to the other pieces of this PR / job groups. Aren't tokens purely a performance optimization?. The issue is that I started with #13475 and after your insightful comment about keeping the batches and job groups tables in sync, I realized that rather than using the batch_after_update trigger to keep the job groups and batches table states identical, we should just go ahead and directly add a double update to the job groups and batches table wherever a batches update occurs in our current code base. Unfortunately, I got stuck with the MJC trigger with these lines of code:. ```sql; UPDATE batches_n_jobs_in_complete_states; SET n_completed = (@new_n_completed := n_completed + 1),; n_cancelled = n_cancelled + (new_state = 'Cancelled'),; n_failed = n_failed + (new_state = 'Error' OR new_state = 'Failed'),; n_succeeded = n_succeeded + (new_state != 'Cancelled' AND new_state != 'Error' AND new_state != 'Failed'); WHERE id = in_batch_id;. # Grabbing an exclusive lock on batches here could deadlock,; # but this IF should only execute for the last job; IF @new_n_completed = total_jobs_in_batch THEN; UPDATE batches; SET time_completed = new_timestamp,; `state` = 'complete'; WHERE id = in_batch_id;; END IF;; ```. We can do the double update in the IF statement to both the job groups table for job_group_id = 0 and for the batches table in #13475. However, this SQL code / approach will eventually need to be changed for the full job group implementation. I don't know how to compute `@new_n_completed` grouped by job group and then `total_jobs_in_batch` would need to be computed per job group as well. I don't think you can use for loops in SQL.

One thought is to offer a few default choices of parameters, and for each document memory usage, empirical error from our benchmarks, and a theoretical upper bound on the error (of the form ""with probability > .99 the estimated q quantile element will have true quantile q ± .001"").

Performance,"Thanks for mentioning me, very interesting reading. You know, framework comparison is the very biased matter.; Sanic has 11,300 GitHub stars, aiohttp has only 6,900. Monthly download count is different: [4,7M for aiohttp](https://pypistats.org/packages/aiohttp) vs [60K for Sanic](https://pypistats.org/packages/sanic). ; Precise download count is a very hard thing (it misses PyPI caches, installing from Linux packages and Docker images etc. etc.) -- but you see the difference anyway. Sanic team is a champion in the library promotion, guys do their job perfectly well. Performance comparison is even harder.; Libraries have different defaults: sanic worker installs *uvloop* by default, aiohttp doesn't do it but utilizes uvloop if `uvloop.install()` was called.; Moreover, the aiohttp performance depends on how the library was installed.; It has C optimizations with Pure Python fallbacks. If Cython/GCC was not available on target machine at installation time the slow pure python code is executed.; In fact, aiohttp in optimized mode runs the same C written HTTP parser as Sanic. Sanic used to run multiple workers by default, aiohttp uses only one. On a real server it doesn't matter because usually the server is explicitly configured to run multiple web workers by gunicorn and (or) nginx config. Now Sanic switched to the single worker by default IIRC.; Anyway, looking on outdated performance comparisons in different blog posts doesn't show any useful numbers unless you re-run and check the numbers on your environment against latest (or used by you) versions. aiohttp uses standard `json` module by default, Sanic `ujson`. `ujson` is faster but it is not 100% compatible with the standard and can fall into memory dumps IIRC. You can configure aiohttp to run `ujson`, `orjson` or `rapidjson` if needed -- all speedups have own drawbacks.

Performance,"Thanks, @tomwhite! This is great. Is there a Hive CLI equivalent of `LIKE PARQUET <file>`? I can't figure out how to get Hive to infer the schema from the Parquet file rather than specifying it explicitly. It would be awesome to be able to query the genotypes, too. It seems like we could write a SerDe (now I'm thinking ImpEx isn't so bad :)) to unpack the genotypes. Does that sound like the right approach?. On a related note, we've played with storing VDS natively as Parquet as (variant, variant annotations, array(genotype)). Even when I ported over some of the GenotypeStream encoding tricks (OD instead of DP, etc.), it was 2-3x larger (using Snappy compression vs. our internal LZ4 compression). That's disappointing, esp. when we have 30+TB datasets on the way. What's worse, simple operations like counting genotypes (`count -g`) are 5-10x in the native representation. Current master:. ```; $ hail importvcf profile225.vcf.bgz write -o profile225.vds read -i profile225.vds count -g; hail: info: timing:; importvcf: 508.829ms; write: 3m6.7s; read: 1.629s; count: 13.934s; $ du -sh profile225.vds; 2.0G profile225.vds; ```. And with the `jg_dataframe1` experimental branch, which uses native Parquet and computes the count using a UDF that computes the sum per array (fastest Parquet-based implementation we've found so far):. ```; $ hail importvcf profile225.vcf.bgz write -o profile225.vds read2 -i profile225.vds count2; hail: info: timing:; importvcf: 492.354ms; write: 5m57.1s; read2: 1.466s; count2: 1m44.1; $ du -sh profile225.vds; 5.4G profile225.vds; ```. That's 2.7x larger and >7x slower. This includes the fact that the Parquet version is only loading the GT field of the genotypes (!). This might be a non-starter for us.

Here are the pieces I think we should separate for devel, though we could consider providing a meta-interface as well that combines some of them for usability. I'm writing (U, S, L) for a local matrix of eigenvectors U, an array of eigenvalues S, and an array of labels L on the rows of U (as with labels for SymmetricMatrix). 1) VDS to a (labeled) symmetric matrix (we have these: GRM, RRM, LD matrix, and Dan is working on a way to read and write them). 2) Symmetric matrix to (U, S, L), which we'll want to write and read. This modularizes the single-core eigen-decomposition bottleneck. 3) Variant-labeled (V, S, L) and VDS with those variants to transport (V, S, L) to sample-labeled (U, S, L). Currently this also requires knowing the number of samples used to make the LDMatrix since that number is used in its normalization. I agree it feels unnatural to need to remember this; to avoid it we'd need an unnormalized version. 4) Sample-labeled (U, S, L) and VDS to global fit of LMM including delta. This is currently a local computation that's been pretty fast in practice but as sample sizes increase we will want to distribute evaluating many values of delta in parallel. Note this step only uses the sample annotations on the VDS, so logically it could also be on KeyTable (which would be the sample KeyTable of the VDS). 5) Sample-labeled (U, S, L), VDS, and delta to per-variant-fit of LMM. This VDS can now contain exactly the variants one wants to fit. (5) should eventually be decomposed as well. The first command should project from Matrix to Matrix (projecting both numeric cells and a list of numeric sample annotations) and some additional small data. Then (6) will do per variant tests starting from after this projection (that is, after what is the BIG computation when you have tens of millions of variants).

Performance,"The problem I saw was this:. ToStream's invariant is that its children must be TIterable. Given this invariant, in boundary it is not safe to call ToArray on streamified when streamified.isInstanceOf[TStream] and node.typ.isInstanceOf[TArray], because this will miss cases (potentially) when node is a different TIterable, and likewise it is not safe to call ToArray on streamified when node.typ.isInstanceOf[TIterable], because we may inadvertently cast a non-array TIterable to TArray, and thereby break boundary's type invariance. So everywhere that we add a ToStream, we need to perform a check on the child: if it's a non-TArray TIterable, return it, else wrap in ToArray, unless we can be sure we never perform said wrap on a TIterable when streamify is called from boundary. . In the latest commit, I simplified the toStream code, and improved the type check to check not TContainer, but (TIterable && !TStream). This is more precise that checking TContainer alone. That being said I haven't created a convincing test yet (though it's trivially easy to make *a* test: pass a ToStream wrapping a node with typ TDict to boundary, with the old check on boundary, and a TIterable check-before-wrap-in-ToStream in the base case of streamify).

Performance,"There is a kubernetes controlled resource that has been exhausted: CPU. CPU is provided by nodes (`kubectl get nodes`). I agree, users should not see this. The core issue is lack of sufficient CPU. We can resolve this in one of two ways:. 1. add more non-preemptible nodes to the k8s cluster. 2. make the non-preemptible node pool auto-scale. For tutorials, we increase the size of the non-preemptible node pool before the tutorial begins. We shrink it again (to save money) when the tutorial is over. We could enable point two, but we now have two new issues:. 1. AFAIK, the auto-scaler only adds nodes when resources are exhausted. Ergo, we only add more nodes when a pod becomes unscheduleable. When this happens, we must wait for a node to spin up (a couple minutes) to provide sufficient CPU for the pod. There has been work towards teaching the auto-scaler about ""slack"" or ""buffer"" resources, but [the relevant PR was abandoned in Dec 2017](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/pull/77). 2. Once the node is alive, it needs to download the docker image so it can schedule the pod. We use a `DaemonSet` to ensure that the latest notebook images is always cached on all nodes. Hail's notebook images are very large. They take about two minutes to download. Actions we can take:. 1. Investigate a system for ensuring our cluster always sufficient CPU for another N notebooks. (i.e. have CPU slack); 2. Shrink our notebook images. We need to get off `conda` (for all our projects). Their `jupyter/scipy-notebook` image is 4.16GB.

Summary of changes:. Introduce CodeBuilder. CodeBuilder allows for the imperative, sequential construction of code. The idea is that it is the imperative analog of Code[Unit]. In this analogy, a function returning Code[Unit] becomes a function that takes a CodeBuilder, alternatively, a Code[Unit] can become a CodeLabel: the place to jump to run a given computation. In addition to CodeBuilder, I have a imperative implementation of EmitCode that is similar to the proposal in the dev post: IEmitCode. Under the above analog, the proposal in the dev post would become:. ```; trait IEmitCode {; def apply(missing: (CodeBuilder) => Unit, present: (CodeBuilder, PValue) => Unit): Unit; }; ```. However, I took the additional step of ""defunctionalizing"" this picture by using labels instead of functions of code, giving:. ```; case class IEmitCode(Lmissing: CodeLabel, Lpresent: CodeLabel, pc: PCode) {; ...; }; ```. In this model, the emit function will become: `Emit.emit(cb: CodeBuilder, ...): IEmitCode`. The discipline is after calling `emit`, the contents of the code builder, when executed, will jump to one of `Lmissing` or `Lpresent` (labels which are not defined yet) and the consumer can define those labels, and use the expression `pc` in the code after the `Lpresent` label only.

Performance,"This is super useful, thanks @jigold! A few high level comments:. - I'd love to have this checked in, but I don't think it should be part of the regular tests, esp. when they run against the production database and this is designed to find/stress the limits of the database.; - Also, this seems most useful for benchmarking different database configuration and settings, and we don't want to vary the production database (and in some cases, we can't, like decreasing the database size).; - Therefore, I think we just have a module you can run that takes a database connection settings and n_jobs, batch_size, batch_parallelism and number of replicates, and runs the benchmark, not integrated with the build system. And .sql files to create/clean up tables. When we want to run it, we can just clone the repo and run it directly. Then we can think about wrapping it in a larger test to spinning up database instances with various node and disk sizes and MySQL settings and see how they perform.; - You explore number of jobs and batch size, but I think you should also measure amount of batch insert parallelism. You can use bounded_gather I sent you. Then basically these two tests correspond to parallelism=1 and parallelism=infinity.; - I think you can get rid of the pymysql version.

However, in ArrayMap there is a requiredeness setter (which is inspired/copied from InferType's corresponding match:. ```scala; coerce[PStreamable](a.pType2).copyStreamable(body.pType2.setRequired(false)); ```. Which causes a nonsensical operation on PVoid, which is required: true (override final val). As an aside, ApplySpecial seems to allow operations on non-identical types, which would require algebraic types, rather than a singular: any time the types of its`Seq[IR]`'s are different. I have similar issues with other array operations, which want nodes that we currently don't support, including aggregator nodes. Note that I am only calling inferSetPType in Compile (immediately after optimization pass).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6594#issuecomment-512957123:1784,optimiz,optimization,1784,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6594#issuecomment-512957123,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']

The makefile conforms to the customary use-whatever-is-on-$PATH, with the slight wrinkle that; the full pathnames of the commands used will be visible in the build log - so if someone; picks up something weird we'll at least see it. 3. There is a cache of NativeModule objects, so that we won't do enormous numbers of; calls to dlopen/dlclose. This may help in shuffle code, which creates a new PackDecoder; for each RV. 4. The hash function on (options, source) is now beefed up to cope with having only a; few distinct values of options; and is modified with the output of ""$(CXX) --version"",; so that when you upgrade your compiler, you won't get hits on modules compiled with the old; compiler. 5. build.gradle has a new target ""nativeLibPrebuilt"", for updating the prebuilt/lib/linux-x86-64; or prebuilt/lib/darwin. 6.

Performance,"We spoke about this in person, but I had this mostly typed up in this buffer so I'll leave it here for future us. Some context on the docker build cache'ing situation. Originally, Docker would use any image layer it had as a cache source. This was noted as a severe security vulnerability because I could make an image that claims to be the result of `apt-get install curl` but actually was the result of `apt-get install virus`. In response, Docker banned the use of non-locally-built (i.e. from the Internet) image layers as cache sources. I believe there may have been other motivations as well, but I did not carefully investigate. https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/26065 documents the desire for a way to use non-locally-built images as a cache source. https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/26839 implements this. Unfortunately, and I cannot find documentation on this, `--cache-from X` means ""cache only from X"". If you pass multiple `--cache-from`s each one is used as a cache source, but it is not possible to say ""use all local images as a cache source"" (other than enumerating them all). [`--cache-from` was included in v1.13.0](https://github.com/moby/moby/releases/tag/v1.13.0), released January 2017. Another subtlety of `--cache-from` is that it does not pull the image in question if it is not found locally. I only found this documented [in a comment on the implementing PR](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/26839#issuecomment-277383550). Docker seems to be in maintenance mode and all new development is going into Moby. The replacement for `docker build` is called [`buildkit`](https://github.com/moby/buildkit). Build Kit has a more reasonable cache'ing strategy wherein [one exports and imports ones cache](https://github.com/moby/buildkit#exportingimporting-build-cache-not-image-itself) to a trusted repository.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5623#issuecomment-474154073:147,cache,cache,147,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5623#issuecomment-474154073,14,['cache'],"['cache', 'cache-from', 'cache-not-image-itself']"

Performance,"` tag prevents us from using other images even though they are in the registry! For example, I pushed two images to `cache`:. ```; (base) # gcloud container images list-tags gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest; DIGEST TAGS TIMESTAMP; fb551d9bdb94 2022-06-10T14:16:39; afb4c5ad2d7b cache,latest 2022-06-10T14:15:55; ```. If I rebuild [1] the most recently pushed image with; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest:cache; ```; it succeeds in getting the cache. If I rebuild the other image with the same import-cache, it does not see that the (untagged) image is already there! . ---. This all suggests that all our attempts at image caching are failing terribly. Options:; 1. Only deploy builds push to a `:cache` tag, everyone uses that tag.; 2. List all the tags in the repository and include them all as --cache-from's (this doesn't actually work: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34715#issuecomment-425933774); 3. Push a tag for each git SHA and then include as --cache-from's the last ten git SHAs on this branch, the most recent common commit with main (i.e. `git merge-base origin/main this-branch`), maybe the current main, and maybe the PR number?; 4. Write our own OCI image builder so we can write our own OCI image cache that actually works the way it ought to (everything in the registry is considered fair game for the cache). It seems like 3 is actually a decent solution that should enable lots of caching.; 1. The last ten SHAs on the branch should speed up repeated builds when you're fixing little bugs.; 2. The most recent common commit with main should avoid rebuilds unless the packages changed.; 3. I suspect the current main is actually not helpful (either 2 will work or 3 wouldn't help).; 4. Pushing to something like `cache-11907` would allow force pushes to still access the last build's images. What do you think of the #3 proposal? . ---.

I would have approved the ujson stuff. The async stuff could have been a separate PR. Nobody wants to review a moving target, so the scope of a change should be roughly frozen when you assign a PR and additional changes should be minimized and restricted to that scope. You're welcome to have an open PR with no reviewer if you're still fleshing out the scope, of course. Thanks!. In response:. 1) aiohttp is an option, but appears to be generally considered slow on a per-response basis (published benchmarks, haven't had a chance to try it), even potentially slower than flask. It seems wrong to choose something slower if there are are reasonable alternatives.; 2) The globals were a feature of the initial implementation (the GitHub cache). It felt outside of the scope of my PR to change that to some queue solution. Meta comment. Ok. I didn't think it had been looked at, and expanded what it did pretty quickly, as I realized that ujson wasn't helping much. I can make a ujson-specific pr, but my goal was to test async library implementations in a simple applications, since we need a long term strategy for python web stuff that isn't Flask (or not just Flask)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461191051:1796,cache,cache,1796,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461191051,2,"['cache', 'queue']","['cache', 'queue']"

Performance,"ad2d7b cache,latest 2022-06-10T14:15:55; ```. If I rebuild [1] the most recently pushed image with; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest:cache; ```; it succeeds in getting the cache. If I rebuild the other image with the same import-cache, it does not see that the (untagged) image is already there! . ---. This all suggests that all our attempts at image caching are failing terribly. Options:; 1. Only deploy builds push to a `:cache` tag, everyone uses that tag.; 2. List all the tags in the repository and include them all as --cache-from's (this doesn't actually work: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34715#issuecomment-425933774); 3. Push a tag for each git SHA and then include as --cache-from's the last ten git SHAs on this branch, the most recent common commit with main (i.e. `git merge-base origin/main this-branch`), maybe the current main, and maybe the PR number?; 4. Write our own OCI image builder so we can write our own OCI image cache that actually works the way it ought to (everything in the registry is considered fair game for the cache). It seems like 3 is actually a decent solution that should enable lots of caching.; 1. The last ten SHAs on the branch should speed up repeated builds when you're fixing little bugs.; 2. The most recent common commit with main should avoid rebuilds unless the packages changed.; 3. I suspect the current main is actually not helpful (either 2 will work or 3 wouldn't help).; 4. Pushing to something like `cache-11907` would allow force pushes to still access the last build's images. What do you think of the #3 proposal? . ---. [1]: I had two files:; ```; # cat sleep/Dockerfile; FROM ubuntu:18.04; RUN sleep 10; # cat touch/Dockerfile; FROM ubuntu:18.04; RUN touch foo; ```; To build I use this command (slightly different syntax from the buildctl syntax, but, AFAIK, uses the same backend):; ```; docker buildx \ ; build \; DIRECTORY_NAME_HERE \; --output 'type=image,""name=gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest,gcr.io/hai",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11907#issuecomment-1152646800:2092,cache,cache,2092,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11907#issuecomment-1152646800,2,['cache'],['cache']

Performance,"ams that fundamentally differ mainly in how the handle http requests and responses, shows the one that is faster at http requests/responses (Sanic) becoming much slower, and in fact reversing its relationship to Aiohttp. This is strange to say the least. I was really curious about this, so I ran the bench. First, I upgraded Sanic to a recent version. Then I ran their test. In short, their results were not what I found. Sanic is 50% faster, and the timeouts are what you'd expect. 26 timeouts for Sanic, 45 for aiohttp.

Performance,"been ""migrated"". If it hasn't then we insert new rows into the ""v3"" table with the deduped resource ID as the key. The exact trigger is . ```sql; DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS aggregated_job_resources_v2_after_update $$; CREATE TRIGGER aggregated_job_resources_v2_after_update AFTER UPDATE ON aggregated_job_resources_v2; FOR EACH ROW; BEGIN; DECLARE new_deduped_resource_id INT;. IF OLD.migrated = 0 AND NEW.migrated = 1 THEN; SELECT deduped_resource_id INTO new_deduped_resource_id FROM resources WHERE resource_id = OLD.resource_id;. INSERT INTO aggregated_job_resources_v3 (batch_id, job_id, resource_id, `usage`); VALUES (NEW.batch_id, NEW.job_id, new_deduped_resource_id, NEW.usage); ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE; `usage` = `usage` + NEW.usage;; END IF;; END $$; ```. What this PR does is find the keys of all rows in the `aggregated_jobs_resources_v2` table in intervals of 100 rows. This is a ""chunk"". The reason is because we want to keep the transactions small and fast. I optimized this and found 100 rows worked best for performance. We then want to set `migrated=1` for all rows in the given chunk which activates the trigger and also maintains idempotency so we only run the update for each chunk once. . Most of the code in this PR is identifying the bounds of each chunk and then doing the update. We have a burn-in period at the beginning where we migrate chunks serially. Then we migrate the chunks in 10-way parallel. This is to get rid of deadlock errors due to row locks with the ""birthday problem"". Lastly, once all of the updates are complete, we run an audit that makes sure the ""v2"" and ""v3"" tables are equivalent and have the same total aggregate resource usage. I believe I also run this audit in chunks here as these tables are massive and a single audit query would take hours. The bounds of the audit for these chunks are on the order of `(batch_id, job_id)` rather than `(batch_id, job_id, resource_id)` which was used for the actual updates. This is because the resource_ids can di",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12849#issuecomment-1771141782:2494,optimiz,optimized,2494,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/12849#issuecomment-1771141782,2,"['optimiz', 'perform']","['optimized', 'performance']"
Performance,"bility and complexity matters. Python is not very good choice for high performance system in any case...For me high performance python is a fantasy, but i don’t do aiohttp/python anymore. In the end it is up to @asvetlov"". from one of the creators of aiohttp, I'm not encouraged about the long-term health of the project. https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2902. In the second branch related to this pull request, linked above, I chose Starlette, and it is a thin abstraction, nearly identical performance, over Uvicorn + httptools, which were both written by Yury Selivanov, the asyncio person I mention above. Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 . Starlette is something like base Go performance (though 1/5-1/10th the performance of Go's fasthttp library for simple responses, and much closer for anything involving database calls). Sanic also uses httptools and uvloop, but has more stuff.. so yeah maybe a bit slower than Starlette, or not, but the diff will probably be small. Regarding the benchmark you linked, it is benchmarking the power of sleep. There is something deeply wrong with their results. Sanic has 1800 timeouts, vs 200 for aiohttp, and 3x the connection errors. Fine, so Sanic is super slow. But look at their non-db tests. Sanic is >2x as fast, 0 timeouts. They aren't using anything Sanic specific to query the database, and both use the same event loop. Adding asyncio Postgres to two programs that fundamentally differ mainly in how the handle http requests and responses, shows the one that is faster at http requests/responses (Sanic) becoming much slower, and in fact reversing its relationship to Aiohttp. This is strange to say the least. I was really curious about this, so I ran the bench.

Bundling cutoffs can be tweaked, but basically any common dependencies between pages are placed into one chunk. Chunks are loaded in parallel, and no chunks are needed to load the page; it's just HTML on initial render. At least some of the chunks could theoretically be served from a CDN (styles of course, some js). Each package expects a .env file, which organizes the environment variables used in that package. This can be used with Kubernetes. `kubectl create secret generic secretesfile --from-file=prod/env.txt`. The .env for the web app, where localhost would be replaced by our sub.domain.

Performance,"ding. You know, framework comparison is the very biased matter.; Sanic has 11,300 GitHub stars, aiohttp has only 6,900. Monthly download count is different: [4,7M for aiohttp](https://pypistats.org/packages/aiohttp) vs [60K for Sanic](https://pypistats.org/packages/sanic). ; Precise download count is a very hard thing (it misses PyPI caches, installing from Linux packages and Docker images etc. etc.) -- but you see the difference anyway.

Performance,"e a detour from adding job groups and get rid of how we currently do the batch update in MJC to allow for job groups in the future before putting in job groups tables so that I could slot in the appropriate state and time_completed updates to both batches and job_groups tables in the same place rather than relying on a trigger for the updates. I can think about which set of changes should go first (I'm not wedded to either PR coming first -- just thought this way was conceptually easier to understand when there was just a batches table). I haven't 100% convinced myself this change to tokenize the `batches_n_jobs_in_complete_states` table is absolutely necessary for nested job groups, but it seemed like we would want the performance improvements regardless. > 2. How come marking the batch as complete is moved into a separate transaction as marking the job complete? If it were in the same transaction wouldn't we not need this healing loop?. This is for performance reasons to avoid serialization and race conditions. If the update occurs in the same transaction, then each transaction will be serialized checking if `n_jobs == n_complete`. If we don't have a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, I couldn't convince myself that there wouldn't be a race condition where a batch completion event isn't accidentally missed. . I think the healing loop would only happen if the batch driver got restarted in between:; 1. CALL mark_job_complete() in the database; 2. mark_batch_complete(). If 1. errors, the operation is aborted entirely. On second thought, it might be possible to use an optimistic locking strategy, but that's more complicated and I'd have to think about it some more. > It seems to me like it would be preferable to instead first update application code to mark the batch complete if it is not complete, then remove the now redundant marking complete of the batch from the trigger. Then there is no delay after the migration where batches are not complete for some time.

Performance,"e reasons the line numbers reported in CI log don't quite match up (using either IntelliJ's goto def - which could say be the result of referencing a different copy on the system - or the [2.7.1 branch on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/branch-2.7.1/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/FileSystem.java)), so I followed the parameterization. Still need to figure out why lines reported don't match, but I've seen line number differences before between that reported for the compiled binary, and the uncompiled source. Lines of evidence:; 1) The line specified in the ci log suggests that Hadoop's fileSystem.open() command fails. It appears from examining the line and source, that the Hadoop Configuration object could be null, which suggests a serialization error in HadoopFS. However, there are many others tests that by touch HadoopFS serialization, and none of them have problems. If it's not a serialization error (say the URI object that hadoop looks for is null, or CACHE is null), it would not seem PR specific. 2) On local, with or without the google storage connector, I cannot replicate the error in cluster-read-vcfs.py. Attempts to replicate:; 1) Local hail install, not using google storage connector, and reading 2 local vcfs:. ```python; gvcfs = ['./HG00096.g.vcf.gz',; './HG00268.g.vcf.gz']; hl.init(default_reference='GRCh38'); parts = [; {'start': {'locus': {'contig': 'chr20', 'position': 17821257}},; 'end': {'locus': {'contig': 'chr20', 'position': 18708366}},; 'includeStart': True,; 'includeEnd': True},; {'start': {'locus': {'contig': 'chr20', 'position': 18708367}},; 'end': {'locus': {'contig': 'chr20', 'position': 19776611}},; 'includeStart': True,; 'includeEnd': True},; {'start': {'locus': {'contig': 'chr20', 'position': 19776612}},; 'end': {'locus': {'contig': 'chr20', 'position': 21144633}},; 'includeStart': True,; 'includeEnd': True},; ]; parts_str = json.dumps(parts); vcfs = hl.import_vcfs(gvcfs, parts_str). ## W",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6083#issuecomment-494037803:2272,CACHE,CACHE,2272,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/6083#issuecomment-494037803,1,['CACHE'],['CACHE']

As an aside I've spent some time reading about this over the last ~month, and besides relatively consistent messaging about the messiness of Python's ecosystem, performance and user experience are deeply important to me, so when I read things like:. ""I don’t think performance matter. I think asgi does not matter in 2018 in general. Usability and complexity matters. Python is not very good choice for high performance system in any case...For me high performance python is a fantasy, but i don’t do aiohttp/python anymore. In the end it is up to @asvetlov"". from one of the creators of aiohttp, I'm not encouraged about the long-term health of the project. https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2902. In the second branch related to this pull request, linked above, I chose Starlette, and it is a thin abstraction, nearly identical performance, over Uvicorn + httptools, which were both written by Yury Selivanov, the asyncio person I mention above. Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 . Starlette is something like base Go performance (though 1/5-1/10th the performance of Go's fasthttp library for simple responses, and much closer for anything",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461259030:1705,perform,performance,1705,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461259030,1,['perform'],['performance']

Performance,"eleted-pods . For users, and for investors, we want to have a permanent record of all user interactions. * Some kinds of data may be awkward to store and query within pod labels. For instance, how much user state do we want to store in labels? How do we store operation graphs / history?; ; * aggregation operations across users or resources; * a given, or all users' history: so the user can manage, see, so we can track (some, gross) metrics for billing; * various sorting operations (by date/time, etc); * full log of state for a given set of related resources (I think k8 stores last 5 events, this is probably configurable) ; ability to retry in a user-controlled way, even if pod is deleted from etcd. * Operations across N k8 resources seems like it may take up to N queries (i.e k8s.list_namespaced_service, k8s.list_namespaced_pod). There may be more efficient ways of handling this (there either is, or should be a way of querying one selector across all resources). . * Performance, even for very basic queries. An initial assumption, may prove to be incorrect, but I think we will find a fast db to be much faster than K8, even if we could directly query etcd. This is based on my experience with Amazon data stores, and general impression/experience with google cs products.; * Open issue on this: even directly accessed, etcd is slow, doesn't index selectors https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/4817. * We may want to differentiate between k8 outages and lack of user requests.

Performance,"ember of the ""getting things done"" community than the; ""modern C++"" community. I have seen std::unique_ptr used in practice, and it was a bad experience.; And I stand by my contention that it doesn't solve any of the hard problems (whereas shared_ptr; very much does). Now I realize that people writing books about C++ write a good deal about move semantics and; unique_ptr. My interpretation is that there's a lot of writing about it because it involves concepts; which simply don't occur in any other commonly-used languages, and as such it requires a; good deal of explanation and justification because it's peculiar and unfamiliar. I suggest that; other languages haven't invented this concept because it's a) confusing and b) not particularly; useful. There's one really good thing you get from move semantics: the ability to resize a std::vector<T>; or std::unordered_map<T> without constructing deep copies of each T object. In the cases; where that's useful, it's very useful for optimizing performance without totally bypassing all your; abstraction mechanisms. The other ways people attempt to exploit move semantics are IMO; just a bad idea: if you want to pass around a large expensive-to-create object, then do it the; Java way by putting it on the heap and passing around some kind of reference, and *everyone* can understand it, not just experts in modern C++. Another angle on this debate would be to look at some open-source C++ projects and see how; often they actually use unique_ptr and/or std::move. My guess is that it's much less common; in practice than you might think from reading books about C++, because the overlap between; ""object ownership is passed around"" and ""... but we always know precisely who has ownership""; is not a very big part of the design space - compared to a whole lot of ""always owned by the object which created it"" and ""used in several places at once and we don't know who will be the last to drop it"".

Performance,"ent/server model, mostly just to make sure I understand: each HailContext has one ShuffleClient,. There should be a ShuffleClient per-shuffle. I think in our current model, this means one active ShuffleClient at any given time (because there's only one active shuffle at any given time). However, I intend Hail service pipelines to be able to use multiple concurrent shuffles, if useful. In particular, a ShuffleClient has as type and an encoding, so its only useful for one type of dataset. Though you could theoretically re-use the object on a different dataset of the same type by calling `start` again. > which communicates with a ShuffleServer (which only connects to one ShuffleClient). I intended the ShuffleServer to serve an arbitrary number of non-adversarial clients (perhaps two different users in nascent hail service). I think it's pretty secure, but I don't think `UUID.randomUUID().toString()` is cryptographically random, so an adversary could probably guess it and thus get access to shuffle data. Moreover, the ShuffleServer must support concurrent connections from all the workers of a Hail pipeline. `ShuffleServer.serve` starts a fresh server thread for every connection. During the read or write phases of the shuffler, the idea is 1:1 mappings from workers to connections to server `Handler` threads. > Every time the hail context wants some data to be shuffled, the server creates a new shuffle ID to associate with the shuffle (starting the shuffle) and then the client sends over the data and can then access it, in ranges, using get. As soon as it starts a new shuffle, it can no longer access the data from the previous shuffle (at least through current interfaces---the shuffle server never deletes shuffled data, so we could theoretically define a put and get that take the uuid and then keep accessing older shuffles as long as we know the uuid). Does that sound about right?. The hail leader node could keep multiple `ShuffleClient` objects around to access old data.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8361#issuecomment-609940052:1099,concurren,concurrent,1099,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8361#issuecomment-609940052,1,['concurren'],['concurrent']

Performance,"esn't prevent PR tests from pushing to the `cache` tag. This change just makes the tests run by the CI-in-the-PR not overwrite the cache. Every image build for a PR (which is tested by default namespace CI) will still overwrite the cache tag. AFAICT, this; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo; ```; Will use as a cache source the `latest` tag in the `gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo` repository. It is *not* sufficient for an image to be present in the repository and untagged or with a different tag from `latest`. In particular, every push to the `cache` tag prevents us from using other images even though they are in the registry! For example, I pushed two images to `cache`:. ```; (base) # gcloud container images list-tags gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest; DIGEST TAGS TIMESTAMP; fb551d9bdb94 2022-06-10T14:16:39; afb4c5ad2d7b cache,latest 2022-06-10T14:15:55; ```. If I rebuild [1] the most recently pushed image with; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest:cache; ```; it succeeds in getting the cache. If I rebuild the other image with the same import-cache, it does not see that the (untagged) image is already there! . ---. This all suggests that all our attempts at image caching are failing terribly. Options:; 1. Only deploy builds push to a `:cache` tag, everyone uses that tag.; 2. List all the tags in the repository and include them all as --cache-from's (this doesn't actually work: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34715#issuecomment-425933774); 3. Push a tag for each git SHA and then include as --cache-from's the last ten git SHAs on this branch, the most recent common commit with main (i.e. `git merge-base origin/main this-branch`), maybe the current main, and maybe the PR number?; 4. Write our own OCI image builder so we can write our own OCI image cache that actually works the way it ought to (everything in the registry is considered fair game for the cache). It seems like 3 is actually a decent solution that should enable lots of caching.; ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11907#issuecomment-1152646800:1276,cache,cache,1276,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11907#issuecomment-1152646800,2,['cache'],['cache']
Performance,"euse and cacheing/locking. a) Even with whole-stage codegen, there's a possibility that during development a user; will be tweaking a query in ways which don't change all the stages. And in that case the re-use; would give hits on some stages. The plan is not really to aim at structuring things to get a; high level of re-use, but just to opportunistically exploit re-use which happens to occur -; e.g. if the early stages of an analysis involve reading an existing file and filtering in various; ways, then that may not be changed at all by changes to what happen in the real analysis; after the filtering. And this is also influenced by the medium-term goal of having a Hail service; which (amongst other things) can do simple analyses on small data in under ten seconds - in; that realm compilation time could become a critical factor as a serial bottleneck. [The place where persistent cacheing of compiled files helps most of all is in testing,; where you really are running the exact same queries over and over again on the same; small datasets, and in many cases after making small changes which only affect a few; of the queries]. b) We may actually have some version of the locking problem even if we don't try to reuse the files -; since we have several workers on a node, and possibly a master as well, all needing to put code; into a file (or wait for someone else to populate the file) so that they can load it. Depending on ; precisely how Spark manages things (which I wouldn't want to depend on too much anyway). In fact it's essential that all the workers share the same DLL file, because otherwise they'd be; trying to load multiple DLL's defining the same symbols.

Performance,"fficient for the cache to work. (I was wrong, see below!). AFAICT, this change doesn't prevent PR tests from pushing to the `cache` tag. This change just makes the tests run by the CI-in-the-PR not overwrite the cache. Every image build for a PR (which is tested by default namespace CI) will still overwrite the cache tag. AFAICT, this; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo; ```; Will use as a cache source the `latest` tag in the `gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo` repository. It is *not* sufficient for an image to be present in the repository and untagged or with a different tag from `latest`. In particular, every push to the `cache` tag prevents us from using other images even though they are in the registry! For example, I pushed two images to `cache`:. ```; (base) # gcloud container images list-tags gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest; DIGEST TAGS TIMESTAMP; fb551d9bdb94 2022-06-10T14:16:39; afb4c5ad2d7b cache,latest 2022-06-10T14:15:55; ```. If I rebuild [1] the most recently pushed image with; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest:cache; ```; it succeeds in getting the cache. If I rebuild the other image with the same import-cache, it does not see that the (untagged) image is already there! . ---. This all suggests that all our attempts at image caching are failing terribly. Options:; 1. Only deploy builds push to a `:cache` tag, everyone uses that tag.; 2. List all the tags in the repository and include them all as --cache-from's (this doesn't actually work: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34715#issuecomment-425933774); 3. Push a tag for each git SHA and then include as --cache-from's the last ten git SHAs on this branch, the most recent common commit with main (i.e. `git merge-base origin/main this-branch`), maybe the current main, and maybe the PR number?; 4. Write our own OCI image builder so we can write our own OCI image cache that actually works the way it ought to (everything in the registry is considered fair game for the cache).

Performance,"g. And this is also influenced by the medium-term goal of having a Hail service; which (amongst other things) can do simple analyses on small data in under ten seconds - in; that realm compilation time could become a critical factor as a serial bottleneck. [The place where persistent cacheing of compiled files helps most of all is in testing,; where you really are running the exact same queries over and over again on the same; small datasets, and in many cases after making small changes which only affect a few; of the queries]. b) We may actually have some version of the locking problem even if we don't try to reuse the files -; since we have several workers on a node, and possibly a master as well, all needing to put code; into a file (or wait for someone else to populate the file) so that they can load it. Depending on ; precisely how Spark manages things (which I wouldn't want to depend on too much anyway). In fact it's essential that all the workers share the same DLL file, because otherwise they'd be; trying to load multiple DLL's defining the same symbols. That aspect of it could be handled by; putting the files into a per-process directory and using in-memory (std::mutex) synchronization.; But y'know, given that we have to write the DLL's out, it just seemed natural to let them persist; (and until debugging it on MacOS, I thought I could manage it with nothing but atomic file-create; and atomic-rename, but that didn't quite pan out). As for writing LLVM IR, it can definitely be done, because that's what Endeca/Oracle did. But there; was such a huge learning curve that only 3 people ever did it successfully (I wasn't one of them),; and debugging seemed very unpleasant and slow. [It was also a masterful achievement in ; job-security-through-obscurity, because no-one in management was going to mess with the; two people who wrote it - until the whole project got canned]. ... and in the time I was there, the Endeca/Oracle stuff wasn't distributed, which could be an",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-412742385:1665,load,load,1665,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/3973#issuecomment-412742385,1,['load'],['load']

Performance,"h MakeArray?. I have some thoughts on that, but I think it would require a bigger change to how we represent streams in the IR. One idea is to put stream producers and stream consumers on equal footing. Right now, a stream consumer is a node with a stream child that produces a non-stream value, e.g. `ArrayFor(stream, name, body)`. We could let stream consumers be values themselves, `ArrayFor(name, body)`, with other nodes for connecting producers with consumers, e.g. `RunStream(stream, ArrayFor(name, body))`. Then I think we would need two `MakeStream`s, one that can be unrolled, and one that can be zipped. The former just directly takes a consumer and produces a value (and can choose to duplicate the consumer code or wrap it in a method). The later constructs a stream producer, which can be freely used in zips, etc. It would definitely require some thought how to optimize such a representation (is there a normal form?). > I'm not sure I see that. If you don't duplicate the consumer, the push code is the same. The question is, do you use a variable + switch to track where you are in the MakeStream, or do you use the program counter via labels, where you get the latter from the former by code duplication. I think the easiest way to see it is to think about how you would zip two `MakeStream`s, both of which represent their state using the program counter. You could do it by statically fusing them into a single `MakeStream`, but what if it was something more complicated like `Zip(Map(MakeStream(...), ...), Filter(MakeStream(...), ...))`? You can't represent a compound state with a single program counter. At a higher level, you can only do the optimization of unrolling the `MakeStream` loop if that is the outermost loop in the generated code. A producer wanting to create the outermost loop is what I mean by a push stream. By contrast, to be able to zip arbitrary streams, you want the consumer to create the outermost loop, and on each iteration ""pull"" from each producer.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8148#issuecomment-591962972:1745,optimiz,optimization,1745,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8148#issuecomment-591962972,1,['optimiz'],['optimization']
Performance,"h the recur and the break expressions) the type `Bottom`. `Bottom` is the empty type, so there can be no closed expressions of type `Bottom`. In the type checker, `Bottom` is only allowed to appear in tail positions, and for `If`, we keep the rule that both branches must have the same type, so either both branches are `Bottom` or neither are. This keeps the semantics simple: an if statement either makes a value or it jumps away, there's no confusing mix. One nice property of this setup is that if an expression has a non-bottom type, then it is guaranteed not to jump away from itself (it may jump internally), so it is safe to method-wrap. This also make codegen very simple, and @iitalics has already implemented it! See `JoinPoint` and `JoinPoint.CallCC`. In the IR, I don't think this requires much change. If we're already adding a continuation context (as mentioned above), then `TailLoop` just needs to bind both a recur and a break continuation, where recur takes the loop variable types, and break takes the loop result type. Then `Recur` can be replaced by a `Jump` node which calls (jumps to) a continuation in context. There's also a middle ground where we make break continuations explicit in the IR, but we want to keep the scheme-like interface in python. Then the pass @cseed described for inferring where the loop exits are would just go in python instead of the emitter. > Using the stream interface seems wrong to me also. When I mentioned this, I was thinking we could reuse the region management logic from the stream emitter for loops, but I've since changed my mind. I think loops will have hard region management no matter what. > What's the type of the stream the loop turns into? Since loops carry multiple values (by design), memory allocating these to create a tuple stream is going to be a performance non-starter. As a side note, @iitalics stream emitter can handle streams of multiple values fine. Effectively, you can make a `Stream[(Code[A], Code[B], Code[C])]`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7614#issuecomment-559072407:3443,perform,performance,3443,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7614#issuecomment-559072407,1,['perform'],['performance']

Performance,"hat seems like a good spot to me from a developer ergonomics perspective:; - O(trusts) modifications necessary to update/revoke the cert; - O(1) configuration to load a trust list; - no pod-start-time configuration; - the trust list is on the container's file system, so its easy to inspect. Small point: I don't pin the incoming certs yet due to the mTLS challenges. ### create on each deploy. Only creating certs if they don't exist is an easy change. Seems fine, though leaves unresolved how to rotate the certs. I guess I'm inclined to always recreate because it makes rotation the common case, forcing us to make it work well. I think the only way to do a no-downtime rotation is:; 1. create fresh certs; 2. create the trust lists including a principal's fresh cert and previous generation cert; 3. update all the secrets; 4. somehow ensure everyone has the latest secrets?; 5. notify all servers to refresh their certificates (nginx: send SIGHUP, aiohttp: we have to write something). We could stick a generation uuid in the secrets and keep refreshing services until the certificate uuid they read is the one our deploy expects. ### mTLS. This PR will land. Things will break because the unmanaged services (router-resolver, gateway, internal-gateway) do not speak TLS. I'll manually deploy them. The default namespace and new PR namespaces should now function properly. Developers will need to redeploy from master. With this in place, I will make another PR with two main changes:; - enable client verification, and; - modify create_certs.py to load the unmanaged certificates from `default` rather than the local namespace.; That PR should pass all the tests (batch pods will speak TLS to internal-gateway; internal-gateway will speak TLS to PR batch using a client certificate PR batch trusts; etc.).

Performance,"http performance depends on how the library was installed.; It has C optimizations with Pure Python fallbacks. If Cython/GCC was not available on target machine at installation time the slow pure python code is executed.; In fact, aiohttp in optimized mode runs the same C written HTTP parser as Sanic. Sanic used to run multiple workers by default, aiohttp uses only one. On a real server it doesn't matter because usually the server is explicitly configured to run multiple web workers by gunicorn and (or) nginx config. Now Sanic switched to the single worker by default IIRC.; Anyway, looking on outdated performance comparisons in different blog posts doesn't show any useful numbers unless you re-run and check the numbers on your environment against latest (or used by you) versions. aiohttp uses standard `json` module by default, Sanic `ujson`. `ujson` is faster but it is not 100% compatible with the standard and can fall into memory dumps IIRC. You can configure aiohttp to run `ujson`, `orjson` or `rapidjson` if needed -- all speedups have own drawbacks. Very famous [Tech Empower Benchmark](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17&hw=ph&test=fortune) demonstrates that sanic is faster than aiohttp on JSON serialization but cannot pass other tests. Please decide is it important or not. The last cherry: Sanic has super fast URL router because it caches matching results. The feature is extremely useful for getting awesome numbers with `wrk` tool but in real life URL paths for server usually not constant. URLs like `/users/{userid}` don't fit in cache well :). P.S.; aiohttp has a place for optimization, we are working on it. There is no single bottleneck, the optimization requires careful improvements in many places, with keeping backward compatibility policy. I don't know the best criteria for choosing. My advice is: look on user API and choose what you like. P.P.S.; `Starlette` has own benefits and compromises as well, but the post is pretty huge already.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461299040:2164,cache,caches,2164,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461299040,5,"['bottleneck', 'cache', 'optimiz']","['bottleneck', 'cache', 'caches', 'optimization']"

However, it's a bit clunkier than the utility method, and will cost a bit more memory. What do you think about keeping the method as a static method? Would you prefer it be moved off PString to some other location?. Also, this is probably a good time to discuss whether we want region in the constructor. Because if not, we can have one loadString function. It is confusing (to me), to have multiple versions of a function that differ so greatly in semantics.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/7754#issuecomment-567164437:1469,cache,cachedVarid,1469,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/issues/7754#issuecomment-567164437,9,"['cache', 'load']","['cachedRsid', 'cachedVarid', 'loadString']"

Chris pointed out I should skip going to disk and pipe into tar, I have not timed that yet. I was seeing fetch being more like 8 minutes to my repository. My repository is significantly larger than Alex's. I could delete some old branches to address this. ---. > for inputs/outputs, I wonder if we should have a flag that indicates it is an archive and do the archive/extract automatically (like you've done here but more generally), and stop using cp -r. I almost went down this route. It would save a couple lines of tar/untar in runImage steps. I felt the savings wasn't worth the effort of implementing it. In the buildImage case (what this PR addressed), I think it's worth it to keep images small. > for downstream steps that only need a small part of the repo, is it better to copy out different pieces (archived or no) rather than copy the whole thing and extra the parts you need?. I haven't investigated this. I agree, there exists an inflection point where the size of data overcomes GCS latency and GCS-throughput / tar-decompress is the bottleneck. There's something to be said for tar'ing everything except for `.git`, but I didn't carefully check which steps need it and which steps do not. ---. In conclusion, I'd say this PR is necessary for #7534, and #7534 is a big quality of life improvement for those of us with large repos running tests on images that are deep on the critical path (the shuffler test is behind 3 images and build hail, which also clones the repo, so for my repo I wait at least 2 minutes before I even have a chance to get feedback; with this PR and #7534 I should wait like 45 seconds?).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7626#issuecomment-560442927:1731,latency,latency,1731,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/7626#issuecomment-560442927,3,"['bottleneck', 'latency', 'throughput']","['bottleneck', 'latency', 'throughput']"

I think `imagePullPolicy: Never` is a bad idea. If there's a bug where the image; is not present, then we get stuck. I think we should rely on k8s to pull the 5GB; jupyter image in a reasonable time period. If we cannot rely on that, we just; start up N nodes before the tutorial, ssh to each and pull the image. If; somehow the image disappears, `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent` ensures we just; experience a delay rather than complete interruption. > When do you reap jupyter pods? jupyterhub has a simple management console that; > lets you shut down notebooks.

Performance,"ion strategy. We could probably build an SSLContext shim that contained two SSLContexts one with a root cert and one with the trusted certs and require certification verification to pass both. Seems easy to get wrong, so I'm inclined to not take this path. ### trusted cert lists. Yeah, it felt a little silly to duplicate the cert in each secret. However, this seems like the simplest approach if I require each principal to only trust a subset of incoming/outgoing principals. If I had one secret per principal, then I have to modify build.yaml or deployment.yamls if I modify the trust sets. That seemed error prone. If I had one secret with all the certs, then when a service starts up it has to select the trusted ones and only insert those into its certificate store. This seems OK, but a little harder to inspect. Duplicating a cert for each trust list to which it belongs occupies what seems like a good spot to me from a developer ergonomics perspective:; - O(trusts) modifications necessary to update/revoke the cert; - O(1) configuration to load a trust list; - no pod-start-time configuration; - the trust list is on the container's file system, so its easy to inspect. Small point: I don't pin the incoming certs yet due to the mTLS challenges. ### create on each deploy. Only creating certs if they don't exist is an easy change. Seems fine, though leaves unresolved how to rotate the certs. I guess I'm inclined to always recreate because it makes rotation the common case, forcing us to make it work well. I think the only way to do a no-downtime rotation is:; 1. create fresh certs; 2. create the trust lists including a principal's fresh cert and previous generation cert; 3. update all the secrets; 4. somehow ensure everyone has the latest secrets?; 5. notify all servers to refresh their certificates (nginx: send SIGHUP, aiohttp: we have to write something). We could stick a generation uuid in the secrets and keep refreshing services until the certificate uuid they read is the",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8561#issuecomment-617428243:2339,load,load,2339,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/8561#issuecomment-617428243,1,['load'],['load']

Performance,"istributed"" which I think is your proposal). Blocks aren't heterogenous in our current setup (last block can be short) and I think that needs to be clarified in your proposal. Slicing has similar complications. I think the blocking should specify the list of sizes of each block, which makes it closed under slicing. I agree the user interface should do implicit broadcast but in the IR it should be explicit. > If we want to support sparse tensors. I vote we punt on sparse vectors for the time being. (In the sparse case, I think sparsity of the output should be inferred by analysis rather than specified. I think statically knowing the sparsity relationship is going to a rarity.). The key point here is that Patrick's operations are incredibly general so this proposal needs to be paired with an compilation strategy that guarantees his operations are never actually realized directly (e.g. deforestation, fusing operations (e.g. broadcast) into their consumers) while also generating BLAS-level performance. I propose we plan to build against BLAS while we investigate more general codegen strategies. To that end, I've suggested we read up on a few related projects in study group: taco (hat tip Patrick), TensorComprehensions, TVM (tensor virtual machine) and Halide. Might be other relevant ones (TF/XLA?) Few questions to ask:; - Can we steal good ideas for our IR?; - Can we target their IR?; - Can we integrate this with our stack?; - What's the performance like (compile time, runtime)?. We'll need some more prosaic operators:; - constructors: from array with shape, from shape and a function of indices; - get shape.; - index: get an element from a tuple of integers. This is only allowed for local arrays.; - slice: get another ndarray from a sequence of integers, ranges, or array of indices.; - reshape. Maybe local only? Or clarified in the distributed case. I think we'll need some additional basic operations supported by numpy (e.g. concatenate, tile), but this is a good start.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5190#issuecomment-459208120:1621,perform,performance,1621,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5190#issuecomment-459208120,1,['perform'],['performance']

Performance,"n by the CI-in-the-PR not overwrite the cache. Every image build for a PR (which is tested by default namespace CI) will still overwrite the cache tag. AFAICT, this; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo; ```; Will use as a cache source the `latest` tag in the `gcr.io/hail-vdc/foo` repository. It is *not* sufficient for an image to be present in the repository and untagged or with a different tag from `latest`. In particular, every push to the `cache` tag prevents us from using other images even though they are in the registry! For example, I pushed two images to `cache`:. ```; (base) # gcloud container images list-tags gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest; DIGEST TAGS TIMESTAMP; fb551d9bdb94 2022-06-10T14:16:39; afb4c5ad2d7b cache,latest 2022-06-10T14:15:55; ```. If I rebuild [1] the most recently pushed image with; ```; --import-cache type=registry,ref=gcr.io/hail-vdc/dktest:cache; ```; it succeeds in getting the cache. If I rebuild the other image with the same import-cache, it does not see that the (untagged) image is already there! . ---. This all suggests that all our attempts at image caching are failing terribly. Options:; 1. Only deploy builds push to a `:cache` tag, everyone uses that tag.; 2. List all the tags in the repository and include them all as --cache-from's (this doesn't actually work: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34715#issuecomment-425933774); 3. Push a tag for each git SHA and then include as --cache-from's the last ten git SHAs on this branch, the most recent common commit with main (i.e. `git merge-base origin/main this-branch`), maybe the current main, and maybe the PR number?; 4. Write our own OCI image builder so we can write our own OCI image cache that actually works the way it ought to (everything in the registry is considered fair game for the cache). It seems like 3 is actually a decent solution that should enable lots of caching.; 1. The last ten SHAs on the branch should speed up repeated builds when you're fixing little",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11907#issuecomment-1152646800:1372,cache,cache,1372,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/11907#issuecomment-1152646800,1,['cache'],['cache']
Performance,"n's ecosystem, performance and user experience are deeply important to me, so when I read things like:. ""I don’t think performance matter. I think asgi does not matter in 2018 in general. Usability and complexity matters. Python is not very good choice for high performance system in any case...For me high performance python is a fantasy, but i don’t do aiohttp/python anymore. In the end it is up to @asvetlov"". from one of the creators of aiohttp, I'm not encouraged about the long-term health of the project. https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/2902. In the second branch related to this pull request, linked above, I chose Starlette, and it is a thin abstraction, nearly identical performance, over Uvicorn + httptools, which were both written by Yury Selivanov, the asyncio person I mention above. Starlette and Uvicorn are currently the fastest options, (Sanic isn't tested), by a relatively large margin, on Techempower's benchmarks. If there is a reference standard benchmark of http library performance, Techempower is it: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r17 . Starlette is something like base Go performance (though 1/5-1/10th the performance of Go's fasthttp library for simple responses, and much closer for anything involving database calls). Sanic also uses httptools and uvloop, but has more stuff.. so yeah maybe a bit slower than Starlette, or not, but the diff will probably be small. Regarding the benchmark you linked, it is benchmarking the power of sleep. There is something deeply wrong with their results. Sanic has 1800 timeouts, vs 200 for aiohttp, and 3x the connection errors. Fine, so Sanic is super slow. But look at their non-db tests. Sanic is >2x as fast, 0 timeouts. They aren't using anything Sanic specific to query the database, and both use the same event loop. Adding asyncio Postgres to two programs that fundamentally differ mainly in how the handle http requests and responses, shows the one that is faster at http requests/respo",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,hail-is,hail,0.2.133,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461259030:2451,perform,performance,2451,https://hail.is,https://github.com/hail-is/hail/pull/5242#issuecomment-461259030,1,['perform'],['performance']
