If you mean `-DLLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB=ON` and `-DCLANG_LINK_CLANG_DYLIB=ON`, these are the recommended switches for a shared library build of LLVM/Clang (see: https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html).

(e.g. why is your IDE trying to edit the headers in the build directory?) Again, just curious, my workflow does not rely on compilation logs for navigation so I never had this problem. The problem might actually stem from a different problem. But first things first:. In VS when you compile a target in ROOT, like Tree, compiler invocations are spawned that compile the various source files. The output of these compilers is piped into a window inside VS. Error messages and warnings are analyzed by VS. You can double-click these in the compiler output window and VS will jump to the file and line where this error/warning occured. This is a super useful navigation feature. The workflow for running static code analysis like clang-tidy is similar. Now the issue is that when you jump to errors/warnings in header files, VS jumps to the copies of the headers in the build directory. If I fix the problem there and recompile/rerun clang-tidy, the errors/warnings of course persist, because the fixed header files are overridden again from the source directory. A possible explanation why VS jumps to the headers in the build directory might be, that the headers in the source directory are NOT part of the CMake targets and thus not part of the VS projects. This is a problem of itself. Btw, I just tried reproducing the problem with the clicks on the output window jumping into the build directory on master and now VS jumps into the source directory.

Integrability,"> > the performance of the llvm::SmallVector comes from the fact it is not exception safe; > ; > Can you elaborate a bit? For us, the performance boost in RVec 2.0 comes from the small buffer optimization, which reduces the amount of heap allocations during analysis event loops. The implementation of SmallVector in llvm assumes it is used in codebases without exception support (like llvm itself). Thus the implementation can make some assumptions which the general std::vector cannot. See some terse documentation [here](https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1SmallVector.html). There are two things I'd encourage you to try and see if you can reach the same level of small buffer optimization as you got now:; * Make a wrapper class which always takes an assumed size over std::vector and call std::vector::reserve; * Make a wrapper class which takes a template argument assumed size and try to allocate the assumed size on the stack, if it exceeds that, call underlying std::vector and move things there.

Integrability,"> @lmoneta the reason why this is not merged is not clear to me: could you clarify?. Ah, now I remember!. This would be a backwards incompatible change, because it changes the meaning of. ```c++; TVectorD{5};; ```; Before, this created a vector with 5 zero elements. With this PR, it will create a vector with a single 5!. This is way too backwards incompatible to be merged. @hageboeck maybe came to the same conclusion, and for that reason decided to not continue working on this PR anymore. Making it work in a backwards compatible way is probably not worth the effort for a legacy pre-STL class like `TVector`. I would instead suggest to change the interfaces of for example TGraph so that they can take initializer lists directly without going over the `TVectorT`. We can also wait for C++26 [1], which will introduce a `std::span` constructor from initializer list. Then we also have the option to use `std::span` in the interfaces to cover this usecase without losing generality: a TVectorT can probably be converted to a `std::span` too.

However, @pcanal was able to run some interactive commands on the node and I got the information I needed. Your test systems have Netlib BLAS installed, wherein `cblas` functions are in a different library than `blas` functions (the latter, I believe, being implemented in Fortran), whereas mine used OpenBLAS, which provides only one library containing everything. GSL uses functions found only in `cblas`, so `FindBLAS.cmake` sufficient to satisfy GSL's needs in only the latter case, which is why I didn't see the problem. The situation is further complicated by the fact that TMVA can handle both situations via conditional compilation (`-DTMVA_USE_CBLAS`). It will require some care to ensure thatall possible situtations can be handled while satisfying the original goal of my PR, that of ensuring consistency of BLAS implementation between all dependents.

Integrability,"> Are there plans/work in progress for ROOT to move to a newer cppyy anytime soon?. Hi @taehyounpark! We have recently upgraded the cppyy frontend in ROOT, which will be part of ROOT 6.32:; https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14507. However, it doesn't fix this reproducer. I suspect that this also requires to synchronize the [cppyy-backend](https://github.com/wlav/cppyy-backend/tree). The problem is that this backend is a fork of ROOT itself, including cling. And then, cppyy made patches to this fork of cling/ROOT for e.g. better lambda support and other advanced C++ features and details of the type system. The problem is that we can't take these patches 1 to 1 back to ROOT, because ROOT also used Cling for other things like IO, and the patches in cppyy did not have to consider compatibility with that. We try to make cppyy independent of cling on the long term to solve this conundrum. In the meantime, I can see what we are exactly missing in upstream ROOT or Cling to make the reproducer in this issue work. Maybe it is an uncontroversial patch. This will also take some time though. I worked a lot on PyROOT in the last weeks and have to work on other responsibilities in the next weeks before coming back to this. Or maybe @wlav has a hint?. > In the meantime, might there be anything I could try to ""persuade"" similar quirks, from either C++ or Python to make them work?. Unfortunately not. In ROOT, we don't use complicated template code with type traits in user interfaces. That's maybe my recommendation to you: can you simplify the user-facing interface and hide the templated stuff maybe behind some type-erased types or simplify it a bit? IMHO, templates are great for efficient implementations, but for user interfaces it can be a nightmare (think only about the error messages...).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15062#issuecomment-2022342966:317,synchroniz,synchronize,317,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15062#issuecomment-2022342966,5,"['interface', 'message', 'synchroniz']","['interface', 'interfaces', 'messages', 'synchronize']"

Right, maintaining backwards compatibility is probably a necessity for such a change. Maybe one can add a (by default enabled) option to symlink from the old libraries to the new ones?

For the average ROOT user this won't make any difference, and in Debian we can disable the option (I don't expect anyone running ROOT software that is still written with Makefiles instead of CMake using Debian system packages).

The old name looks nicer to me. roofitcore/Initialisation used to be roofitcore/RooBanner.cxx and Stephan converted it so that he could add the library loading code. This code is now moved, but I still believe it's a good idea to stay Initialisation.cxx in case there's a need in the future for other init routines to be added. (static functions shouldn't exist in random files but only in a specified Initialisation.cxx file). batchcompute/Initialisation.cxx for the moment only inspects the hardware and loads the correct version of the library, so it is again initializing... .

Integrability,"> I am not in favour of this solution.; I don't think is bringing any advantages, we were using a plugin manager that was based on the interpreter and there were no direct dependency on fftw3.; Now you require people to directly install fftw3 and they would need to set also the include path. It is an over complication for the users. You are right, when building ROOT with `fftw3=ON`, it brings zero advantages but only makes if more fragile because `fftw3.h` needs to be in the path. *Edit*: it just came to my mind that this might actually be a rare case. Right now, `builtin_fftw3*` is always `OFF` by default, also on cfmfs. So the `fftw3.h` header was already found in the include path at build time, which means it's probably found when running ROOT too. However, in case where ROOT is built with `fftw3=OFF`, this makes the difference between the `RooFFTConvPdf` even working or not. And this case is relevant because we release the ROOT binaries like this. Since we need to make sure that FFTs work in RooFit when people install ROOT on their laptops with the binaries, I think a fix like this is necessary. Maybe as a compromise, I could apply the these changes only in case where `fftw3=OFF` by using preprocessor macros?

Inside the implementation of this function, I have no typename `T` with which I could construct internally a `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<RDFDetail::RMergeableValue<T>>>`. Thus, I need a struct that holds a `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<RDFDetail::RMergeableValueBase>>` (keep in mind that any subclass of `RActionImpl` defined in `ActionHelpers.hxx` has a method `std::unique_ptr<RMergeableValueBase> GetMergeableValue() const`, so inside `RVariedAction`'s `GetMergeableValue` I don't have any information about the concrete mergeable value type).; I would also just return a `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<RDFDetail::RMergeableValueBase>>` directly from this method, but then I would break the pattern of passing around unique ptrs to `RMergeableValueBase` and I would need to change the interface just for `RVariedAction`",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9942#issuecomment-1061744458:1224,interface,interface,1224,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9942#issuecomment-1061744458,1,['interface'],['interface']

Yes indeed that's a different behaviour. The existing logic never throws. In case `dir == nullptr`, which I guess happens if the expanded directory cannot be found/opened (?), then it will just fall to the end of the `TChain::Add` method and `return nf`, where `nf` will be zero since no files have been added. In this regard I see two options:. 1. The new function throws (because subjectively is the correct behaviour).

Integrability,"> I think that is sufficient efficient evidence albeit there is one more simple test to do, is to introduce a synchronization point every once in a while to insure that the queue is actually filled/used and then later emptied. Right; for this I went back to the variant of the benchmark that has perfectly balanced time per event and fills identical data into 10 branches. Then I added barriers around the call to `TBufferMergerFile::Write()` to make sure there is as much synchronization and contention as possible. With that, only the run with 64 threads on `/data/ssdext4` is measurably slower (4m16s instead of 3m57s, 9%), lower numbers of threads show very similar performance within noise. However, I then realized that the second barrier after the call to `Write()` is actually not necessary since we want contention when going into the merging / queuing, but the second barrier prevents threads that exit merging early from making further progress. With *only one barrier* before the call to `TBufferMergerFile::Write()` the version without any queuing is consistently faster at higher thread counts. I think this supports my hypothesis that things will balance out automagically.

What is the difference between the two interfaces?. Hi @vepadulano, thanks for your comments!. The `RooAbsReal::evaluate()` is for evaluating a single data point in the old scalar interface, and `RooAbsReal::doEval()` would be to evaluate arrays in the new vectorizing evaluation backend. Indeed, I considered calling it `eval`, but decided to go for `doEval` for two reasons:; * git grepability: it's not good for code navigation is the name of one function is a substring of another function name; * existing ROOT patterns: the `doEval` function should not be called by the user, but is used internally in the `RooFit::Evaluator`.

Integrability,"> My question was: is it possible to modify the ROOT-cmake-find script, so that it only forces the nlohmann-json-dependency if you are going to use ROOT7 classes? So to say, that depending on the `REQUIRED COMPONENTS` that you use in the `find_package` statement in your user code, it is more or less 'requiring'. That's an interesting question. 🤔 CMake project's can't easily do this. I mean, nothing is impossible, but it's not simple to do. As long as externals are handled through imported library targets (which I'm not sure the nlohmann_json dependency is used with 😕), one would need to tweak the behaviour of CMake in a pretty fundamental way for this. 🤔 You see, when you tell in (in this case) ROOT's build that library `Foo` needs to publicly link against library `Bar::bar`, CMake exports this information in the `ROOTConfig-targets.cmake` file. (That is a file generated fully by CMake itself.) It will say that `Foo` depends on `Bar::bar`. So at that point `ROOTConfig.cmake` has to produce `Bar::bar` in some way. Even if the user's code itself never wants to use the `Foo` library. Because CMake will not like it that it has the `Foo` library defined (even if unused by others), without all of its requirements met. So even if `ROOTConfig.cmake` itself doesn't look for nlohmann_json, if any of the CMake code depends on the `nlhmann::json` target (yes, there is such a target in CMake 😄), the CMake configuration would still fail. With a complaint about `nlohmann::json` not being known. 😦. So generally, projects that publicly depend on something else, always look for all of those dependencies with [find_dependency(...)](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/CMakeFindDependencyMacro.html).

Integrability,"> Not that I know off. They are limited to each TBuffer/TBasket. Then we should try to fix that, so that each `TBranch` is a single zlib stream when compressed with zlib. > Yes and the chunking of the generation is determining the clusters size. We wanted to increase the number of tasks based on that idea, but the TTree clusters are not actually set by this. It is set by the [auto-save option](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RSnapshotOptions.hxx#L35) in `RSnapshotOptions`. The problem is that the default is to not auto-save, but save only when calling `Write()`, which then happens only at the end of a full task that may generate lots of data that will stay in memory until the end. It's probably enough to make auto-save default to save at every 5-10% of generated data. We already call `Write()` depending on this setting, so in principle there's no need to increase the number of tasks. > This is a bit surprising. The TTree is supposed to be re-using as much as possible the memory chunk (both the compression buffer and the TBuffer) as much as possible.

In practice, this means that the same 'happenstance' you describe might not be true on other platforms. Furthermore the compiler is also allowed to re-order code in 'surprising ways' that would thwart/foil the assumption on the happenstance you describe. Thus our policy, consistent with the standard is that if a value can be updated while being read, it either must be an atomic or both the read and write must be protected by a lock.

Integrability,"> Thanks for your comments! . Thanks for the discussion. I think many students learn C++ from root examples so it matters.; ; Thanks for the link to the docs. I got a little confused about Heap().Create details when I looked at first (and there you go) but I get it now. I learned two things:. a) RDirectory can take an existing shared_ptr using Add() instead of Create(), super!; b) Little thing but it looks like Create() syntax cannot cast a TH1F to a TH1. I've learned to always want a TH1 and never a TH1F, as their interfaces are identical after construction (nothing sliced). Implicit casts make it not a huge issue but I'd still prefer to cast to a TH1 smart pointer first and then use Add(), a trivial nuisance. Maybe Create has a way to cast that I'm missing, or could. Now, There's a lot to unpack here. Let's just stick with my pure subroutine version (not class version) for direct comparison for now. I could pass a structure anyway obviously. Now I can do this, with a TH1F... example 1: ; ```cpp; //my_subtrounes.C. // my_subroutines.C; void my_subroutine(shared_ptr<TH1> &x) {; x.reset(); // not needed for TH1F, but safer in general.; x.reset(new TH1F());; // .. do something with it.; }; ```; ```cpp; //make_th1.C; #include <ROOT/RDirectory.hxx> // one extra line ;); #ifdef __CINT__; // shared_ptr<TH1> mc_global_x,mc_global_y,mc_global_z; // but saved one line here...; #endif. void make_th1() {; shared_ptr<TH1> x,y,z;; my_subroutine(x);; my_subroutine(y);; my_subroutine(z);. // and the last we do is leave globals on the heap for interactive user if needed:; #ifdef __CINT__ // I wouldn't leave the globals in compiled code. ; RDirectory::Heap().Add(""test1"",x); // this line is ""extra"" compared to PR, but puts caller in control.; RDirectory::Heap().Add(""test2"",y); // but using RDirectory requires 3 lines now ;); RDirectory::Heap().Add(""test3"",z); // ; #endif; }; ```; I'm ok with this.

Integrability,"> The intent is the opposite. The RDirectory's internal representation and what it returns is a kind of shared_ptr. The user register the same name twice then if they hold a 'reference' to it, they keep and if they don't it is deleted. I do appreciate that as written it works and prevents a leak. New and delete have also worked for 20 years of root, and when written correctly do prevent leaks and get the job done, so there's no crisis of course. This offers a little more protection in some usages, but maybe new things to understand in others. I think stack-based lifetime management is simple, intuitive, encourages top-down code design and configuration, and avoids side effects. The smart pointer is interesting. It wasn't obvious to me that create would behave like shared_ptr::reset(), in the sense of allowing copies to persist (rather than redirecting some pointers they contain to the the new thing). . I kind of see a way now that it's possible to get the scalability (produce variable N plots at a time) without editing the PR routine. From my caller I'd need to call the subroutine, then do an RDirectory::Find() to get a shared pointer which will preserve the created thing, then call the routine again to get a new one. And if I still want to keep the first one for the interactive prompt, I have to make it global again with a new RDirectory::Add() of the contained thing, with a new name.

I understand the confusion, for the case of objects that were stored on disk it might be better to already have ownership of everything inside of them.

The behaviour of ROOT object ownership may not always be the expected one, but is documented in [the manual](https://root.cern/manual/object_ownership/) and in the relevant class references.

Because in general that is not true, a Python object is deleted/deallocated when the garbage collector decides it is the right time. Then, here you don't have pure Python objects, but there are also C++ objects underneath. ROOT takes care of lifetime management of the object it knows about. In the code above the objects are not properly registered.; * For Python it is quite unnatural to explicitly manage resources: in most cases I would agree. There are some notable exceptions, for example when you manage file I/O or even more when you manage databases (the standard Python `sqlite3` library comes to mind).

Integrability,"> We have this standard tutorial: https://root.cern/doc/master/canvas2_8C.html; > Without your change the axis titles appear as you see on the reference guide online.; > With your change all the titles disappear. Ok I've just run this demo, thanks for pointing me to it, and yes I confirm with my fix the titles disappear. But that was only because an offset of ""5"" was now too big, so I reduced it to ""1"" and they reappear. But I see now that the way they reappear for the x-axis is great but for the y-axis they depended on the height of the pad, so I concede that the fix as it stands isn't going to giver desirable behaviour. I think what I was trying to achieve here was a title offset that scales sensibly with the label offset, so that you dont have to tune the title offset for each pad size you work with. For example, if I take the histogram from the example and plot it to its own canvas in current ROOT, suddenly the offset of 5 is way too big and the titles disappear. I tried the following which seems to work well. ```; charheight /= (gPad->GetWh()*((x1==x0) ? gPad->GetAbsWNDC() : gPad->GetAbsHNDC()));; ```. With this change, and making the titleoffsets in the example=1, things look pretty, and also if I plot the histogram to its own canvas the same offsets then things still look good. . See the attached screenshot. The plots on the left are existing ROOT and note the title offsets are 5 in both cases, so ok for top left but no good for bottom left. But with the line above in TGAxis, title offset of 1 in both cases looks pretty reasonable to me. But I appreciate this is a change in behaviour that may be undesirable.

Hi, the discussion is here: https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/performance-effects-in-a-root-based-data-acquisition/45519/3, I am developing a 40Gbps DAQ system where readout performance is critical to not lose data. Depending on which CPU the DAQ thread is located, the readout is fast enough to not lose any data. That's why setting CPU affinity was proposed. Without it, some readouts were not fast enough to catch up with the data rate. I do not know about TBB, thus not sure if it would be better or worse. In any case, I am not a thread expert, so if there is a better solution, I would be happy to try it instead of the current attempt with CPU affinity. Just as a side note, for my application, I do not need highly parallel tasks, I just need two threads (one for the GUI, one for the DAQ). If I do not set the affinity, Linux puts them both on the same CPU and thus the DAQ readout performance is reduced.

Integrability,"> You can always check that (value in the bin after fill) - (value in the bin before fill) is reasonably close to the value that was added, and print a warning message otherwise. Not really. Your suggestion would work well if you only had `AddBinContentByOne`. But if you have `AddBinContentByWeight`, then what's ""close"" becomes non-trivial. In other words, Closeness is a function of Weight. So your limit would depend on Weight. There is no way to ensure that that a user always calls AddBinContentByWeight with the same weight. There is no way to ensure that the user calls uses the same weight for each bin of the histogram. This would result in different ""overflow bin limits"" for every bin in the histogram. So it's an ill-posed problem. I attempted to do this with `std::nextafter - current_value` comparing it vs `weight`, but as said, this is completely problematic if you have changing weights.

Integrability,"@Axel-Naumann Thank you for looking at this! I thought of your approach also; using move semantics to transfer ownership means TGraph does not need to make a copy either. The idea on this branch is to demonstrate the potential for a significant performance speed-up in the constructor by not making a copy of the data. Additionally, sharing ownership with TGraph means a user can use the data for things apart from in a TGraph and/or update a TGraph after modifying the data. . In either approach, a user would still be able to use the existing TGraph constructors, however the ROOT file writing classes need an update to write `shared_ptr` or `vector` objects to a ROOT file. Thinking about this, another solution would be to use move semantics and to add a non-const accessor to the TGraph interface, which may work better when writing to a ROOT file.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9610#issuecomment-1056881682:792,interface,interface,792,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9610#issuecomment-1056881682,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"@Axel-Naumann yes, testing is one of the motivations, in particular continuous testing to prevent future regressions (now we can check against an external implementation, instead of just copying the current values and declaring them ""known-good""). The other reason, and why I think this might provide benefit for users, is performance: The original RANLUX implementation by James (at least its implementation in GSL) needs 40 seconds to sum 1 million numbers at luxury level 3, `gsl_rng_ranlux389` (luxury level 4) takes a bit more than 1 minute. The same sequence takes less than 8 seconds with `RanluxppCompatEngineJamesP[34]`, respectively (due to the LCG, you don't even pay for higher decorrelation!).; The difference is even larger for `std::ranlux48` (used directly, not through `std::uniform_real_distribution` which eats up more than one number per iteration): 2m55s compared to 12 seconds with `RanluxppCompatEngineStdRanlux48`. And because we can generate the same sequence, switching the generator won't change the output of a simulation / analysis / ... (only the interface is slightly different). Plus the users get the possibility to skip in the very same sequence without generating the intermediate numbers. Now we could argue that all users should switch to `RanluxppEngine2048`, which on top of that provides better seeding and even higher decorrelation. On the other hand, the implementations above have been around for some time now and are so widely available (`std::ranlux{24,48}` comes with any C++ compiler) that they will remain used...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8383#issuecomment-857732772:1077,interface,interface,1077,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8383#issuecomment-857732772,1,['interface'],['interface']

Integrability,"@amadio thanks for the comments. How this solves the CMS problem is illustrated by the example callback I included. That wraps the merge operation with an `std::promise()`, does a `task_arena::enqueue()` with that functor to the existing CMS framework TBB task arena, and then waits for the promise to complete. `task_arena::enqueue()` guarantees that the functor is executed by an existing member of the arena's thread pool. If the calling thread is not part of the arena, it cannot join it, so it cannot execute the functor itself. AFAICT, `task_arena::enqueue()` is the only interface that guarantees this; with other interfaces like `task_arena::execute()` or `task_group::run()`, the calling thread can temporarily join the arena, which would violate our framework's scheduling assumptions. wrt the interface change, my previous version added a second callback instead of modifying the existing one. From a functionality standpoint, the wrapper callback is a superset of the completion callback, but I do see the virtue of keeping the completion callback safe and having a separate callback for the riskier operation of wrapping the merge. I can certainly make that change if that would be more acceptable. I initially tried to do this with the `TTaskGroup`; unfortunately, with a `TTaskGroup` the calling thread can end up temporarily joining the task arena, which wasn't acceptable to us. It seems we have to use `task_arena::execute()`, which requires access to the framework task arena, which is how I ended using a callback for this. Let me know if separating the merge wrapper into a second callback would be acceptable.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1706#issuecomment-371486460:121,wrap,wraps,121,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1706#issuecomment-371486460,7,"['interface', 'wrap']","['interface', 'interfaces', 'wrapper', 'wrapping', 'wraps']"

Integrability,"@dpiparo @bbockelm ,. Hi Danilo,. Based on current cache replacement policy, the cache will be invalidated (set fIsTransferred to kFALSE) immediately once the first event miss occurs. In my current implementation, each task monitors fIsTransferred and return immediately without doing actual unzipping work. But we still need to create tasks corresponding to the number of baskets. I am wondering if we should add task_group.cancel() function into TTaskGroup interface? In that case, the main thread only needs to cancel all tasks once the cache is invalid. . With event simulation benchmark, I did not see too much difference between task_group wait and cancel.

Integrability,"@egpbos Hi, I just landed here while trying to catch up with messages on Mattermost's Pull Requests channel... My advice is to write the builtin option last, after all work on adding roofitZMQ is done. First, please provide just an implementation using only an external version of ZeroMQ. Then, after that is done, you can add a separate commit that adds the builtin option for ZeroMQ. The builtin option should be optional and never enabled by default (See ROOT-9385 in Jira for more info). Building rootfitZMQ should not be controlled by the option that enables the builtin, but by its own option, which should respect the option `fail-on-missing` if that is enabled and ZeroMQ is not found in the system. I will review the changes again once you mark this PR as ready (just add me as a reviewer when done). I also recommend to clean up the git history a bit by rebasing and making each commit work on its own. For example, if you fixed an earlier commit with a newer one, I recommend using `git commit --fixup=$hash`, then `git rebase -i` to combine the changes into the commit that was broken rather than keeping the fix in a separate commit.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870358974:61,message,messages,61,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8385#issuecomment-870358974,1,['message'],['messages']

Integrability,"@etejedor That sounds like a good idea. I've said before that this diff is so old that the Numpy parts can be cleanly removed and reimplemented on top of new developments from the past year. That should include TTree::AsMatrix. I was also thinking of some jagged and object types, which are considered ""destructive"" storage by BulkIO, yet are not too hard to reconstruct. The code I've written to interpret these raw buffers as structured data has been separated out of uproot so that it can be used independently*. I'll present that on Monday at the ROOT Workshop and we could talk about it then. * For instance, PyROOT could ""optionally"" depend on them, only performing a Python import inside a method call.

Integrability,"@guitargeek While addressing your comments, I started thinking that there's perhaps a better design. 1. I don't think we should have a default parameter at all, but only one ctor with the offset parameters. In real life current cases, these classes are always used from MinuitFcnGrad and they always share offsets with one or two other Likelihood* objects. The only cases where no shared offsets are necessary is in unit tests, but in those cases it's easy to just create a dummy offset vector.; 2. All the offset management is distracting a bit from the core Likelihood logic. I think it may be nicer to make a simple wrapper class `LikelihoodOffset` that holds the shared_ptrs to the vectors, does the swapping, and a few other things. This also makes it easier to create, because the unwieldy types that you also rightly point out would then only be contained within `LikelihoodOffset`.

Integrability,"@hahnjo Thanks for the input, I am also wary about the backwards-incompatible change in behaviour. Your idea of the ""lazy"" wrapper source is sound and I also don't see major blockers against implementing it. On the other hand, the current behaviour of RDataFrame, which does not open files at construction time but at JITting time, is not really a design choice but rather a side-effect of using `TChain` as the concrete IO backend for all TTree-based RDataFrame instances, whether the user is processing a single file or more. Every other data source, including the RNTuple data source, opens a file. We could foresee that even with chains of RNTuple we still want to open the first file right away to derive the schema and some metadata. From my current understanding and the time spent on this PR, my current belief is that the backwards-incompatible change is almost a bugfix, and opening just one file does not introduce practical penalties in users' workflows, rather it also allows for early error catching potentially.

Integrability,"@henryiii I guess I can work around this problem with a `const_cast`, but `const_casts` are evil and should not be necessary to access a basic feature of the public interface. In my understanding this is an interface bug. I agree that my solution is not optimal either, so if you want to take a deeper look please do. In `iminuit`, we run MIGRAD with the class `MnMigrad`. If you look into `MnMigrad.h`, you will see that it only allows one to access the `ModularFunctionMinimizer` as a const reference. The `ModularFunctionMinimizer` allows us to access the `MinimumBuilder` as a const and non-const reference, but the latter is non available, because `ModularFunctionMinimizer` is already const. The only way to set the print level for `MnMigrad` that I can see is via; `MnMigrad.Minimizer().Builder().SetPrintLevel(...)`, and that only works when `SetPrintLevel(...)` is const. As far as I can see, it makes sense that `MnMigrad` only hands out a const reference.

For convenience, there are methods `Error`, `Warn`, `Info`, `Debug`, which use a globally set prefix for convenience and to make the code more readable and less redundant. The global prefix is set with a scope guard. Thanks to RAII, this works also for nested scopes. .

Integrability,"@osschar the problem that it will not work... Having TGLIncludes.h (with #include <GL/glew.h>) make RGL depends on GLEW, and then as a consequence, I need to put graf3d\ftgl (FTGL) depends on RGL. Having this is creating circular dependency:. ```; CMake Error: The inter-target dependency graph contains the following strongly connected component (cycle):; ""FTGL"" of type SHARED_LIBRARY; depends on ""RGL"" (weak); ""RGL"" of type SHARED_LIBRARY; depends on ""FTGL"" (weak); At least one of these targets is not a STATIC_LIBRARY. Cyclic dependencies are allowed only among static libraries.; CMake Generate step failed. Build files cannot be regenerated correctly.; make: *** [Makefile:9096: cmake_check_build_system] Error 1; ```. Why it was not visible before because TGLIncludes.h were copied in ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/include/ where it was picked up by whatever ROOT library you were building before.

Integrability,"@p-bhagyashree and I have found an issue related to this one, which is hinted at in the last comment on the [forum post](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/cannot-access-roomcstudy-genpardataset/46724/6) that was also linked in the description of this issue.; The comment mentions an error message, which we also observed (although the `prodpdf` is `simpdf` in our case):; ```; [#0] ERROR:InputArguments -- RooDataSet::merge(fitParData_prodpdf) ERROR: datasets have different size; ```; Looking through the source code, this is happening when attempting to merge the `fitParData` and `genParData`.; The reason that they are different sizes seems to be because [`genParData` is added to for every experiment that is generated](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/v6-28-00/roofit/roofitcore/src/RooMCStudy.cxx#L368), while [`fitParData` is only added to if the fit succeeds](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/v6-28-00/roofit/roofitcore/src/RooMCStudy.cxx#L683). The bug could presumably be fixed therefore by delaying the append to `genParData` and again only doing so if the fit is successful.

Integrability,"@pcanal @Axel-Naumann I spoke too soon. While I can request the dictionaries manually to get rid of the error I run into a problem when checking them:. In the pairdict example I can run the following in the root prompt. ```; root [2] c = TClass::GetClass(""std::pair<int,MyClass::MyEnum>"");; root [3] b = c->GetListOfBases(); (TList *) nullptr; ```. So the list of base classes doesn't exist. While for a `std::pair<int,int>` I get the correct base class to `__pair_base<int,int>` and it does have a class pointer:. ```; root [1] c = TClass::GetClass(""std::pair<int,int>"");; root [2] b = c->GetListOfBases(); (TList *) @0x7ffd1c3fce98; root [3] TBaseClass* bc = (TBaseClass*) *(b->begin()); (TBaseClass *) 0x1a678d0; root [4] *bc; (TBaseClass &) Name: __pair_base<int,int> Title:; root [5] bc->GetClassPointer(); (TClass *) 0x1a3e5f0; ```. Now after adding `#pragma link C++ class std::pair<int, MyClass::MyEnum>+;` to the `linkdef.h` the error message is gone but I get the following. ```; root [1] c = TClass::GetClass(""std::pair<int,MyClass::MyEnum>"");; root [2] b = c->GetListOfBases(); (TList *) @0x7fff4c93b268; root [3] TBaseClass* bc = (TBaseClass*) *(b->begin()); (TBaseClass *) 0x19c4bd0; root [4] *bc; (TBaseClass &) Name: __pair_base<int,MyClass::MyEnum> Title:; root [5] bc->GetClassPointer(); (TClass *) nullptr; ```. I do have the proper hierarchy but the `__pair_base` base class doesn't have a valid ClassPointer so I'm not convinced this is all working as intended. Now I can solve this weirdness as well by requesting the `std::_pair_base<T1,T2>` dictionaries as well. But at this point I am a bit skeptical so I would like some confirmation that this is not just some stupidity on my side. .

Integrability,"@stwunsch, the problem is twofold. First, `cling::printValue` relies on extra interpreter runtime, which is generally not available (the non-modules implementation resolves the problem by chance). This runtime (containing various printValue overloads) was designed to be made available if somebody requests it via 'standard' value printing request, that is, by calling an evaluate-aware interface. Second, the use of `cling::printValue` works around the intended way to communicate with the interpreter when it comes to extraction of execution results. We can make `cling::printValue` work by unconditionally including all runtime in question. That would slow down some usecases (notably outside of ROOT) for no good reason. In my opinion, `cling::printValue` is on the border of being a public API and internal implementation detail. Relying on it is rather dangerous because it can break (as it broke with modules).

Integrability,"A new interface is perfectly fine. Right now, there is no way to run even an expression with zero side effects without leaking. But as to your first point, a failed transaction (such as the lookup of a type or function that does not exist) also leaks, and is even more common. Such a transaction should, by design, not have any side effects. These leaks affect any PyROOT user and it would not surprise me if ROOT I/O is hit by this, too, given the double lookups everywhere, with and without `std::`, with one of the two regularly failing. As for your second point, that interface is broken on Windows 64b already and simply changing the return to `intptr_t` has a massive ripple effect, so if that platform is ever in the cards, you're going to have to deal with it anyway. Plus, a trivial augmentation would be to take a pointer to a value wrapper, which by default is `nullptr`. If given, return the value there, if not, keep the old behavior. That won't break any code, but will allow current clients to stop part of the leaking.

[GetSize](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTCollection.html#af0ca154693eeb1e9d9a0ff3a8d43e466) returns the capacity of the object, you need to use `GetEntries` for the number of elements (I know, terrible naming). That should solve number 1.; 2. that's annoying (and a bug to fix, of course) but you can work around it by passing the list through a `std::sort` and a [`std::unique`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/unique) to remove duplicates; 3. as the error message says, you need to generate dictionaries for `RVec<ROOT::Math::PtEtaPhiMVector>` for ROOT to know how to read/write that type. For 3., some examples on generating dictionaries are at https://github.com/eguiraud/root_dictionaries_tutorial .; As a quick workaround, adding these lines before the `reproduce` function:. ```cpp; #ifdef __CLING__; #pragma link off all globals;; #pragma link off all classes;; #pragma link off all functions;; #pragma link C++ nestedclasses;; #pragma link C++ class ROOT::VecOps::RVec<ROOT::Math::PtEtaPhiMVector>;; #endif; ```. and then executing `root -l -b -q reproduce.C+` should generate the dictionaries you need.

Integrability,"Am I afraid but changing how the enable_if templation is done is not going to be trivial I think. Firstly, the suggested 'second method' of moving the enable_if to the template parameters does not seem to work with the `DisplacementVector::Unit` method as then the method no longer depends directly on the SCALAR type. So the only option I think is to use a third method which is a hidden parameter. i.e. ``` ; template < typename SCALAR = Scalar >; DisplacementVector3D Unit( typename std::enable_if<std::is_arithmetic<SCALAR>::value,SCALAR>::type* = nullptr ) const {; const auto tot = R();; return tot == 0 ? *this : DisplacementVector3D(*this) / tot;; }; ```. Frankly, I consider this ugly as it has introduced a hidden parameter to the otherwise parameter-less Unit() method. Is this really preferred to templating on the return type. The other issue, and this is one I have run into before is I am unable to figure out how to the switch between the scalar and vector versions of the `Unit()` method with this technique. The problem is the hidden parameter types has to be different, so if I do something like. ``` ; template < typename SCALAR = Scalar >; DisplacementVector3D Unit( typename std::enable_if<!std::is_arithmetic<SCALAR>::value,void>::type* = nullptr ) const {; {; SCALAR tot = R();; tot(tot == SCALAR(0)) = SCALAR(1);; return DisplacementVector3D(*this) / tot;; }; ```. All hell breaks loose and I get a stream of compilation errors, which are pretty non trivial to decode... I have been in this position before and also found the templating on the return type just easier to get working... .

Integrability,"Apologies for the brevity before. In my attempts to set the alignment differently on the first and last labels, I found only one value seemed to be set. On trying to make a minimal reproducer, I'm finding that for certain, changing the LabelFont is not working if all labels are not set correctly. ```; python; >>> import ROOT; >>> h = ROOT.TH1D(""h"", """", 5, 0, 5); >>> for bin in range(h.GetXaxis().GetNbins()+1):; ... h.GetXaxis().ChangeLabel(bin, 10*bin, 4*bin, -1, -1, -1, """"); ...; >>> h.Draw(); Info in <TCanvas::MakeDefCanvas>: created default TCanvas with name c1; >>> h = ROOT.TH1D(""h"", """", 5, 0, 5); for bin in range(11):; ... if bin < 2:; ... align = 11; ... elif bin > 7:; ... align = 12; ... else:; ... align = 13; ... h.GetXaxis().ChangeLabel(bin, 15*bin, .1, align, -1, 43, """"); ...; >>> h.Draw(); ```; Produced the attached axis, so the rotations are working, but a separate test suggests that alignments are not when the rotation is different than 0 (setting the rotation to 90 seems to produce identical alignment for all labels, as far as I can tell). Setting the pixel size to e.g. 10, of course, blows up those labels to greater-than-canvas size, they're being interpreted as fractions still. That is actually related to a problem I had a few days ago, accidentally passing fractional instead of integer (>1) values for size when the font precision is changed to absolute scale, but I'm not sure it's worth a warning or error message when it's being set. So, separate from the documentation: what is the appropriate way to find the number of labels?

Integrability,"As a developer and maintainer of Delphes, I am quite happy with TClonesArray. As far as I know, storing TClonesArray in TTree was the fastest and least crash-prone method for all ROOT 5 versions and early ROOT 6 versions. If there is a newer and better method that meets all of the Delphes requirements, I would be interested in seeing and evaluating a few examples. Before doing any pull requests, let's start with something more basic. I think a very basic example showing how to write/read a collection of generated particles to/from a file would be a good starting point. > something that works well with today's software world :-). Newer doesn't always mean better :smiley: Especially in the HEP community where some researchers are still happy with CERNLIB and PAW and do not want to migrate to ROOT :smiley:. At the moment, Delphes maintains compatibility with ROOT 5 and I still receive questions from researches who use Delphes with ROOT 5. So, Delphes is still regularly tested with Ubuntu 14.04, GCC 4.8 and ROOT 5. If the new IO method only works with recent versions of ROOT 6 and requires the change of file format and programming interface, it will be a major change for Delphes.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8644#issuecomment-878284568:1145,interface,interface,1145,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8644#issuecomment-878284568,1,['interface'],['interface']
Integrability,"As a drive-by comment, just to throw out the idea: Instead of opening the file at construction time, we could invent an ""indeterminate wrapper datasource"" that opens the file only once needed and then decides to internally create a datasource for either TTree or RNTuple, forwarding future calls through one layer of indirection. As far as I can tell (without having implemented it), this should solve the problem of dealing with partially constructed `RDataFrame`s and not require a backwards-incompatible change in behavior. The cost would be one additional indirection, but this may be just fine given that `RDataSource` is already a `virtual` interface...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13090#issuecomment-1886524675:135,wrap,wrapper,135,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13090#issuecomment-1886524675,2,"['interface', 'wrap']","['interface', 'wrapper']"
Integrability,"As a first quick reply, along the lines of our private discussion on the forum: if there are errors like those you mention printed on screen during the processing, indeed you can expect the output to not be all ok. In particular RDataFrame does not deal well with disappearing/reappearing branches. The TTree schema is expected to be constant across the whole dataset being processed. I am not 100% what the effect will be in this case, it also depends on how TTreeReader, TChain and TTree (which RDataFrame uses internally for I/O) react in these cases. With that said RDataFrame should do its best to diagnose this and throw an exception rather than continuing the processing until the end.

Integrability,"As a heads-up: I tried this PR to integrate RNTuple merging into `TBufferMerger`. It needs some change (for example `RPageSourceFile` needs to work with a `TMemFile`, ie we need a `RRawFileTFile` that wraps a `TFile` pointer), but then it mostly runs through. The only problem is that this code doesn't consider merging into a ntuple that already exists in the output file. As a result, all pages will be there but the meta data will only have the cluster(s) from the last merge. What we probably need is the `RPageSinkFile` for the destination to load an existing `RNTuple` anchor and append to it... If there are other approaches, I'm all ear but otherwise I don't think it should block this PR, just something to keep in mind for the future.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14398#issuecomment-1956782963:34,integrat,integrate,34,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14398#issuecomment-1956782963,2,"['integrat', 'wrap']","['integrate', 'wraps']"
Integrability,"As a quick summary:; The only thing left in this PR is the addition of a `ROOT::Libraries` target, which provides a convenience target that mimics `${ROOT_LIBRARIES}` only with targets instead of a variable full of strings. The main three reasons to have it:. * A new user does not need to know whether they depend on `ROOT::Physics` or `ROOT::TreePlayer`, etc; * Adding required components to the `find_package` will also add them here, so no need to repeat yourself in simple packages; * It is not simple or trivial for an external CMake tool to build this target (Flags, for example, is a bit ugly to make, but it can be done).
