Deployability,"Thanks, @gokalpcelik! That's unfortunate that the packages are no longer accessible. However, this old version of the environment was also somewhat problematic in that it included build strings, installed many packages using pip instead of conda, and was otherwise overly restrictive, see e.g. https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/community/posts/360061666671-Broken-conda-env-create-n-gatk-f-gatkcondaenv-yml. I would suggest, in the following order:. 1) Users upgrade to more recent versions of GATK; 2) Users use the 4.1.0.0 Docker; 3) Users edit the 4.1.0.0 environment to be less restrictive. For example, using Ubuntu 20.04.2 + conda 23.10.0, I was able to build something that is probably sufficiently close to the 4.1.0.0 conda environment by making the following changes:. ``` <- certifi=2016.2.28=py36_0; < - openssl=1.0.2l=0; < - pip=9.0.1=py36_1; < - python=3.6.2=0; < - readline=6.2=2; < - setuptools=36.4.0=py36_1; < - sqlite=3.13.0=0; < - tk=8.5.18=0; < - wheel=0.29.0=py36_0; < - xz=5.2.3=0; < - zlib=1.2.11=0; ---; > - openssl=1.0.2l; > - pip=9.0.1; > - python=3.6.2; > - setuptools=36.5.0; > - wheel=0.29.0; > - xz=5.2.3; > - zlib=1.2.11 ; ```. There is some clobbering that happens with the pip installs, but nothing major. Note that I cannot guarantee that this environment exactly reproduces results generated with the Docker (and it's possible that there might be a more minimal fix), but it's perhaps a starting point for those users that cannot go with the other (highly preferred) options.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8504#issuecomment-1852138745:195,install,installed,195,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8504#issuecomment-1852138745,3,"['install', 'upgrade']","['installed', 'installs', 'upgrade']"

Deployability,"Thanks. This shows that bcast can go faster when given more RAM: going from; the earlier experimental envelope of 192GB of RAM to 256GB instead, the; bcast version can go from 19 min to 10min (sharded takes 7min with the; small amount of memory). This is consistent with my earlier experiments; that also showed that increasing the RAM-per-core sped up the bcast; computation. I wouldn't worry about having found a configuration where sharded performs; poorly. My experiments so far have shown that there are lots of; configuration points where one or the other performs poorly; the onus is on; finding the good configuration values that result in better performance, or; identifying which algorithms may be performant for a larger range of; parameter choices. To maximize understanding I would suggest that we not change too many; parameters at a time. For example it seems unnecessary to have multiple; variants of the 128Mbp input. I found there can be significant (>50%) variation between identical runs.; One way to reduce this is to set spark.task.maxFailures=1 which I strongly; recommend for all experiments going forward. One concern I have is that our cluster memory is already far larger than; the input size. In fact here each machine can fit the whole input; comfortably in RAM. This is not going to be the case for the full input.; Since it would take too long to iterate using the full input, it seems wise; instead to reduce both the input size and to keep a close eye on the amount; of memory we're using to make sure we're not going down a path that would; not be able to cope with the full input.

Deployability,"That is a separate matter altogether from both 1) unifying the allele-count collection tools, and 2) standardizing the format of tabular data. The most appropriate place for integration of Mutect2 SNV calls would be as input to the tumor-heterogeneity tool (along with the ModelSegments output) further downstream. This is because it is unlikely that including the SNVs as input to ModelSegments would significantly improve either segmentation or modeling there. If the allele-count collection tools are unified, I think that the only redundant work done across both pipelines would be the calling of hets from the pileups, which is extremely cheap.

A new option `--do-not-sort` is introduced to skip output record sorting. A major source of heap usage is the output buffer in the `ClosestSVFinder` class, which ensures records are emitted in coordinate-sorted order. This buffer quickly fills, however, when there is at least one record being actively clustered that spans a large interval because the buffer cannot be flushed until a variant beyond the maximal clusterable coordinate of that large variant is encountered.

For the most common logging systems (log4j, jul, JLC, etc.), there are this implementation and even no-op logging. One of the nice things from slf4j is that it allows to use the logging format set by the software to every library dependency, controlling the verbosity of other libraries too. . After having a look to the gradle dependencies, it seems that ADAM and Spark use slf4j. This will allow better integration with the two libraries: now the `slf4-jdk` is completely removed, and I don't know if this will blow up at some point if some of the ADAM/Spark classes try to load them. In addition, it will make GATK4 more general.

Deployability,The changes in #5112 introduced several problems that have prevented us from performing a maven release of 4.0.9.0. I believe that the two issues are:. 1.

We retained this logic to make comparisons with VQSR as straightforward as possible. In this logic, which originates from htsjdk, an alternate allele with len(REF) = len(ALT) is counted as a MNP and classified as a SNP. However, we are now applying VETS to long-read genotyping of SVs, where inversions satisfy the same criterion but are then awkwardly classified as SNPs.

Deployability,"The new pipeline is in a complete state. Nearly all tools and scripts were rewritten, many from scratch. I've tried to minimize interaction with old `tools/exome` code (notably, `ReadCountCollection` and `SegmentUtils`).

WDL:; - I've moved the old pipeline to `somatic_old` folders.; - There is now just a matched-pair workflow and a panel workflow. We can add a single BAM case workflow or expand the matched-pair workflow to handle this, depending on the discussion at https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3657.; - WES/WGS is toggled by providing an optional target-file input.; - For all workflows, we always collect integer read counts; for WGS, these are output as both HDF5 and TSV and the HDF5 is used for subsequent input.; - For the case workflow, we always collect allelic counts at all sites and output as TSV.; - [x] We should output all data files as HDF5 by default and as TSV optionally.

The installDist target produces a different jar file that doesn't shadow; all of the dependencies, and so I think it needs to be run with the 'gatk'; wrapper script that sets the classpath in build/scripts. It is a little confusing having all three jar targets, and maybe you guys; don't want to support that, but I was hoping to make a fat jar with all the; dependencies bundled, and the previous 'fatJar' target wasn't working; properly.

With separate repos, a change in the AVX repo wouldn't affect the PPC repo until the maintainer of the PPC repo updated it (after doing appropriate testing of their own), since the PPC repo would depend on a tagged version of the AVX repo. There could also still be some level of code sharing between the two implementations, since the PPC repo would pull in the AVX repo as a dependency.

This algorithm is not a good heuristic and we should replace it with something better, some ideas from that branch that might fix a few of its shortcomings:. 1) Increase/decouple the kmer size used with the reads from the assembly graph kmer size to prevent the filtering step from being redundant with assembly; 2) Normalize the scores to the haplotype lengths to deal with haplotype size bias.; 3) Change the scores to instead reflect the absolute count of unsupported kmers from the graph to also deal with hapotype size bias. ; 4) Iteratively expand the kmer size used for filtering to pare down the number of haplotypes in a more principled fashion.; 5) Utilize the read kmer occurrence counts to construct the scores in order to reduce the risk of spurious reads being sufficient support for a given haplotype. .

Need to confirm reproducibility of results between versions, see also #5730.; 2) Configure Theano 0.9.0 to use MKL, rather than OpenBLAS. It appears the leak is only an issue with the latter. This is a little more complicated, since I now realize that MKL is not actually fully utilized (if at all) in our conda environment. For example, we `pip install numpy`, rather than `conda install` a version from the `default` channel that is compiled against MKL. So we'd need to change a few dependencies in the environment which might have implications for VQSR-CNN. See also #4074. @lucidtronix any thoughts? @jamesemery and @cmnbroad might also be interested, as this could have pretty drastic implications for the size of the python dependencies---if we go with option 1, we might be able to get rid of MKL, etc. Not sure if the memory leak manifests the same across all architectures.

Exclude Spark from the JAR file to avoid library conflicts. It's normal to exclude Spark and Hadoop from JAR files since they are supplied by `spark-submit`.

Deployability,"These are a bunch of random, mostly just annoying things that I repeatedly encountered during the Java 17 port that we should look into. . **Log Spam Issues:** (these result in lots of error log spam that make the logs super hard to scan when there is a failure):. - The WDL test logs are riddled with “localization by hard link failed” and ""Docker not found"" failures, which makes it hard to scan them for real failures. Can we eliminate/fix these ?; - The logs have a few gradle task dependency warnings - we should hunt down the cause. ; - We routinely pull ~800 branches every time we run git clone for a CI job. Can we do shallow git clones?; - We're using deprecated gradle features that result in warnings in the logs, these should be updated.; - The test runner seems to serialize (via toString) every argument to every test method. Many of these have *huge* ""toString"" representations (i.e., `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.tools.spark.sv.integration.ExtractOriginalAlignmentRecordsByNameSparkIntegrationTest`) that fill the logs with reams of huge test values. We should codify/unify the test case wrapper class that we use in htsjdk for these cases. . **Other Issues:**. - We should review the shadowJar contents - it includes some surprising stuff (i.e., the publish-picard.sh script we use to publish picard).; - Do we still need the unpacktestjar task in `dockertest.gradle`, to work around testNG inability to find tests in a jar ?; - The test matrix job names all look the same in the github UI because only the first N characters are displayed, and they all have the same prefix. We should rename them so they start with unique prefixes.; - The library it.unimi.dsi:fastutil:7.0.61 appears to not be used [Fix] (reported in IntelliJ/Project Structure/Problems).; - It's non-intuitive that the *Dockerfile* builds the `run_unit_tests.sh` script.

The dictionary is fictional and immaterial, so long as it is carried forward consistently from the count files to downstream outputs (which the tools do automatically). You could pretend that we started with simulated BAMs that were all aligned w.r.t. this fictional reference/dictionary. (It's just more work to simulate at the BAM level, which is why we start with the counts; simulating BAMs would also not increase test coverage in any meaningful way.). There are already a number of checks to guarantee dictionary consistency, but as you can see from that issue, there are a few scenarios where dictionaries from intervals might not be available via the engine.

Deployability,"These downstream protected tests only need to run on each merge into master, not when a PR is opened, so that should address the security issue. (I misspoke earlier, sorry -- only the tests in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2298 need to run for each PR). The goal is just to have a badge on github that lets us know whether protected is working with the current build of public/master (and it often won't be in the course of development). Workflow would be:; 1. A merge goes into GATK public/master; 2. Job grabs the HEAD of public/master, and builds and installs a snapshot into the local maven repository using `./gradlew install printVersion`; 3. Job needs to save the last line of output from `./gradlew install printVersion` in a `gatkPublicVersion` variable -- this is the version of the snapshot of public that was installed to maven local.; 4. Job checks out latest GATK protected/master and executes the command to build it and run the full test suite, but as part of that command it overrides the GATK public version to point to the snapshot version installed locally and saved in the `gatkPublicVersion` variable above. It is trivial to patch protected's `build.gradle` to add the ability to override the GATK public version when running gradle commands (we can help with this part).; 5.

Deployability,"Think it might be worth saving a VariantFiltration pass for the bit of code it'd take, but up to you!. ScoreVariantAnnotations will output both the raw ""VQSLOD"" score and the converted sensitivity, so we're free to specify thresholds on either. However, given that different types of models may have scores in different ranges (e.g., BGMM vs. IsolationForest, positive/negative vs. positive-only, etc.), I think it's better to restrict all command-line options to be expressed in terms of a sensitivity. Same thing goes if you decide to filter externally with VariantFiltration for now. Even though you have both quantities available to you, just use the sensitivity. This brings us to questions related to whether we want to keep the old VQSR requirements of having both training and truth sets specified. For example, we could instead drop the distinction between training and truth for the new tools, and always calibrate sensitivity to the training set (you can essentially force this behavior with the current code by specifying training=true,truth=true for all of your resources). And yes, all of the tools should have a variety of command lines in the tests to demonstrate behavior. If you want to explore positive/negative mode, take a look at the *Unlabeled tests.

Deployability,This PR expands the GermlineCNVCaller integration test suite and addresses #6893 and #4375. The tests that were added are: . - Numerical accuracy test that checks for changes of gCNV model posterior values as compared to a previously computed model. This test is meant to detect Python library updates that affect gCNV results and unintentional consequences of minor gCNV model changes.; - A test that runs gCNV in the COHORT mode with a pre-trained model as a starting point.; - A test that runs gCNV with an annotated intervals file that contain GC content column. As @samuelklee suggested we should consider adding functionality to the GermlineCNVCallerIntegrationTest to regenerate test files when there is a discrepancy in gCNV model outputs and we are okay with that discrepancy.

Deployability,"This PR fixes two bugs. First, the SplitIntervals task would enter WeightedSplitIntervals and hang. I added an extra boolean argument to extract so you can specify that no, you really don't want to use a weighted bed. Relatedly, the code branch for running the original GATK SplitIntervals code wasn't correct, as passing weight-bed-file to it as an argument caused a failure. It uses a slightly hacky method of defining a string in WDL to be empty or not depending on if we use weighted beds, interpolating that string into the bash, then checking to see if it's empty there to transmit that state. There is likely a cleaner way to do this, and in the next revision I will likely rewrite this part cleaner. Second, after SplitIntervals passed we hit an error during ExtractTask. The way it expanded intervals to handle large deletions could sometimes subtract past the start of a chromosome, so that logic needed to be patched in a few separate places to handle the interval for the mitochondrial dna that started much closer to the beginning (instead of having a 10k base pair buffer).

Deployability,"This PR is the initial stage of implementing the calling of IMPRECISE variants in the SV pipeline. It introduces the concept of an evidence-target link, which joins an evidence interval to its distal target. This is an extension of the 'coherent' evidence concept previously used in determining evidence thresholds for assembly. The code in this PR contains the following changes:. - Evidence intervals and distal targets now are treated as stranded, and evidence-target link clustering depends on overlaps between both intervals and strands.; - Evidence target interval and distal target interval calculations have been modified to make sure that evidence supporting the same event clusters together (has overlapping intervals). This includes several changes such as extending the 'rest-of-fragment-size' calculation to try to capture almost all non-outlier fragment sizes in the library; increasing the split read location uncertainty a little; and being more precise about the boundaries of distal target intervals by taking advantage of information in the MD and MC tags if available.; - Evidence target links are gathered for every piece of evidence supporting a high-quality distal target. ; - Evidence target links are clustered together and store the amount of split-read and read-pair evidence that went into each cluster.; - All evidence target link clusters that are composed of at least 1 split read or at least 2 read pairs are collected in the driver and emitted in a BEDPE formatted file specified in the command line parameters.; - A `PairedStrandedIntervalTree` data structure is introduced to allow `SVIntervalTree`-style lookups for paired intervals. To finish this work, future PRs will 1) use the collected evidence target links to annotate our assembly called-variants with the number of split reads and read pairs observed in the original mappings and 2) create IMPRECISE VCF records for events that have enough evidence-target-link support, first for deletions and then possibl",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3469:89,pipeline,pipeline,89,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3469,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Second, the scripts now respect the project argument at each phase of the pipeline. Third, the output directory will include the name of the cluster so that if multiple samples are being processed by the same branch in parallel it's easier to figure out which results directory contains which sample and the results won't collide if two runs happen to start at the same timestamp.

Deployability,"This PR reimplements the overlap detector used in WeighedSplitIntervals in a much faster form for our particular use case. It also involved preprocessing the weighted bed input file in a new way, so the previous weights files will no longer work.

I pulled down the documentation and rationale for the original process from the git issue to a markdown file that can live in our repo, and made python scripts out of the necessary bits of python logic there (as well as a new one to do the further preprocessing step that I added). The motivation for this was the inability of the previous WeightedSplitIntervals task to complete when run against an exome interval list. This new one does, and it does so quickly.

The bug was caused by an off-by-one index error: `IndexRange(0,2)` returns `[0,1]`, not `[0,1,2]` as intended. Not including this genotype inflated the quality score for these sites. . Due to interactions with QUAL-based variant and allele trimming, this causes slightly different behavior when HaplotyeCaller is run in modes where it is forced to emit variants for every locus, as can be seen in the `expected/gvcf.basepairResolution.includeNonVariantSites.vcf` test file for `GenotypeGVCFsIntegrationTest`: 1) Sites spanned by a deletion are now reported with a `*` alt allele and have QUAL 0 and a LowQual filter.

Deployability,"This is an experiment to see if it's possible to run BWA-MEM on Spark. (Please don't merge.) The basic idea is that it uses JNI to call BWA-MEM's align function to align a batch of read pairs in one go. I think it should complement the work that @SHuang-Broad has been doing in #1701. It would be great to get your (and @akiezun's) feedback on the direction here. A few comments; - Building the native libraries is not integrated, and it's not using the Apache 2 licensed code. I think this could use some of the changes in #1701.; - The ref is assumed to be on the local FS for the moment - it should really be loaded from HDFS. Also, the output is a single SAM file on the local FS, not a sharded BAM as for the rest of the GATK Spark tools.; - It is assumed that read pairs are interleaved and reads in a pair are placed in the same split (by setting `hadoopbam.bam.keep-paired-reads-together`). However, that property only works for queryname sorted BAMs, which isn't the case here, so we need to relax that requirement in Hadoop-BAM.; - I haven't tried this on large inputs, so I don't know how well it performs. To run, I used the following on a cluster. ```; ./gatk-launch BwaSpark \; --ref /home/tom/workspace/jbwa/test/ref.fa \; --input hdfs:///user/$USER/bwa/R.bam \; --output /tmp/bwa.sam \; -- \; --sparkRunner SPARK --sparkMaster yarn-client \; --driver-memory 3G \; --num-executors 1 \; --executor-cores 1 \; --executor-memory 3G \; --archives jbwa-native.tar#jbwa-native \; --conf 'spark.executor.extraLibraryPath=jbwa-native'; ```. The interesting bit is the use of Spark's `--archives` flag to copy a tarball of native libraries (which I built manually) to every executor, and unpacks it in the working directory. Then `spark.executor.extraLibraryPath` is set to add that path to the library path of the executor. This means that you don't have to rely on the native libraries being installed on every node in the cluster.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1750:419,integrat,integrated,419,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1750,2,"['install', 'integrat']","['installed', 'integrated']"

Deployability,"This is an update of where I am at with this issue. It turns out that using --forceActive and --dontTrimActiveRegions only worked for picking up some of the het SNP calls with HaplotypeCaller. A fun side effect was that some calls that were made with the 'vanilla' best practices HC options were now being missed with the forceActive/dontTrim options. So our clinical team decided to use samtools/bcftools for a pileup approach in combination with HC. We call variants with samtools/bcftools then filter the 'samtools' vcf for VAF > 0.15 and pass that vcf to HC with the -L flag to force HC to make these calls. This is working, all of the calls we are trying to pick up are now being found with our combined method. We also run the vanilla best practices HC on our data and merge the vanilla and samtools vcfs after they go through HC for downstream hard filtering and annotation. Part of this hybrid vanilla/samtools method is for continuity, we're been running 'vanilla' HC for awhile now and didn't want to completely drop it for our new samtools/HC calling approach, so we are combining both to be extra conservative. We decided to keep HC around for 2 reasons, 1) it's not going to give us as many false positives as a 'pileup' method and 2) our downstream annotation software has been set up for dealing with HC vcf files and switching to another vcf INFO format would be painful. But it certainly has causes some alarm about the 'unknown unknowns' that we could be missing in a clinical context. All of these troublesome variants checked out with Sanger sequencing, so this is definitely a real issue and the problem is occurring in clinically-relevant genes, such as F5. I'm happy to provide additional info to help the GATK development team figure out why these variants are missed with HC in the 'vanilla' best practices mode.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3697#issuecomment-431985127:11,update,update,11,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3697#issuecomment-431985127,1,['update'],['update']
Deployability,"This is based on @davidadamsphd's initial work to port mark duplicates to Spark. It's not finished yet, but I wanted to post this for discussion. In particular 7 of the 56 mark duplicates integration tests are failing with ""Cannot get mate information for an unpaired read"" - I'm not sure how to address that. I'd appreciate some help on this one. The code currently has four shuffles: one groupBy in transformFragments (in MarkDuplicatesSparkUtils), two groupBys in transformReads, and one combine (foldByKey) in generateMetrics. The combine is more efficient than the others since it can run on the map side, reducing the amount of data that goes through the shuffle. I think it may be possible to merge the processing of the fragments and the reads to eliminate a shuffle - so there are only two shuffles for the main transform. A fragment would be represented as a pair with an empty second slot, so it can be handed in the processing separately from the true pairs that have both slots filled.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/889:188,integrat,integration,188,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/889,1,['integrat'],['integration']

(Also, note that those tools take a sequence dictionary as an input to specify which contigs should be plotted; typically, this will be a subset of the full dictionary that excludes alt contigs, etc. Requiring this sequence-dictionary input is somewhat vestigial; previous versions of the pipeline did not include dictionaries in the headers of all CNV data files.

Currently, we have an external python script performing this step in the gCNV pipeline. I also updated the AnnotateIntervals task and calls in WDL, but these changes are untested; the reviewer should check carefully for typos. Currently, all annotations are of double type, but I've added code that can support all types supported by the TSV code as well. Additional tracks can also be added relatively easily. Currently, allowed annotations and their corresponding types are hardcoded; we could possibly move this information to the SAM-style header in the future. For the Umap hg19 k100 single-read mappability track and the segmental-duplication track used by the Talkowski lab, annotation of 1kb bins on hg19 takes less than a minute with the default feature lookahead (which is exposed as a parameter). I tested using the Umap multi-read mappability track (which is orders of magnitude larger, but is actually what is used in the external script), but this is much slower (documentation indicates that the single-read track should be used to dissuade this).

NovaSeq-sequenced paired-end reads (2X151bp) were aligned (onto hg19 reference), duplicate-removed, base quality score-recalibrated and BQSR-applied, which eventually used as an input to the PathseqPipelineSpark. . Since I failed to find hg19 host reference in the GATK resource bundle, first I created a BWA image file and a Kmer file originated from hg19 reference fasta with the command below. But for microbe-related files, I used ones that were contained in the bundle.  . **'''** ; ; **gatk --java-options ""-Xmx50G"" BwaMemIndexImageCreator -I ./ref.fasta** ; **gatk --java-options ""-Xmx50G"" PathSeqBuildKmers --reference ./ref.fasta -O ref.hss** ; ; **'''**.  . And then I ran PathSeq with the following command.  . **'''** ; ; **gatk --java-options ""-Xmx200G"" PathSeqPipelineSpark \** ; **--input sample.bam \** ; **--filter-bwa-image ref.fasta.img \** ; **--kmer-file ref.hss \** ; **--is-host-aligned true \** ; **--min-clipped-read-length 70 \** ; **--microbe-fasta pathseq\_microbe.fa \** ; **--microbe-bwa-image pathseq\_microbe.fa.img \** ; **--taxonomy-file pathseq\_taxonomy.db \** ; **--output sample.pathseq.bam \** ; **--scores-output sample.pathseq.txt** ; ; ; **'''**.  . and unfortunately it was shut down by this error message. **09:27:43.974 INFO NativeLibraryLoader - Loading libgkl\_compression.so from jar:file:/mnt/clinix1/Analysis/mongol/phenomata/Tools/Anaconda3/envs/gatk4/share/gatk4-4.1.4.1-1/gatk-package-4.1.4.1-local.jar!/com/intel/gkl/native/libgkl\_compression.so** ; **Mar 05, 2020 9:27",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6493:368,install,installed,368,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6493,1,['install'],['installed']

Deployability,"This should fix the travis failure by forcing lfs to overwrite the existing commit hooks. The issue seems to be this:. We install lfs in the first part of the travis build, and then we run a docker build and mount the git folder into it. Docker then installs lfs again. The problem is occurring because git lfs 3.1.1 which released 2 days ago changed the format of the pre-push and other git hooks. Then it throws an error when it's installed again and there are hooks that look different than it expects already in place. Running install with `--force` fixes it. The lfs devs actually have a system for ignoring these differences, but they forgot to update their list of allowed differences ( or however they match it) in 3.1.1. They then released 3.1.2 today which fixes this. In most cases this would fix the issue, except the git-lfs installed INSIDE the docker image is on an ancient version and never updates since the ancient image ubuntu is pegged to an out of date one. While the one in travis outside of docker gets updated to the most recent one. So we have to manually force this. We should probably also update our ubuntu image to a newer one. Of note, we don't actually NEED lfs in the docker for the tests at all, since we've already downloaded the files outside of docker and are mounting them in. Here's a passing build where I remove it https://app.travis-ci.com/github/broadinstitute/gatk/builds/246595037. I'm afraid though that some other system depends on it so I don't want to change it. .

Deployability,This sounds like the EAMS filter that is implemented in Picard picard/illumina/parser/BclParser.java . The purpose of this filter is to convert the ends of reads for which the quality has deteriorated and convert them to 2. This used to be a filter that illumina ran on their data as they converted to fasta but since we wanted to convert BCL directly to bam we implemented this in our code-base.

Deployability,"This was mentioned already as a comment in #562 but it should be an issue instead. BQSR on Dataflow can _theoretically_ avoid the step of saving the textual report, instead piping the recalibration analysis results directly to the ApplyBQSR phase. In practice it cannot, because it turns out that **saving a report and immediately loading it back is not a no-op**. it actually changes in some necessary way. It would be great if someone familiar with that part of the code could help factor the mutation apart from the saving/loading, so I could just call that in the pipeline.

Minor TODOs:. - [x] Parameter-level docs.; - [x] Parameter/mode validation.; - [x] Refactor main code block for model training; it's a bit monolithic and procedural now.; - [x] Decide on behavior for ill-behaved annotations. E.g., all missing, zero variance. Future work:. - [ ] We could allow subsetting of annotations here, which might allow for easier treatment of ill-behaved annotations. However, I'd say enabling workflows where the set of annotations is fixed is the priority.; - [ ] We could do positive-unlabeled training more rigorously or iteratively. Right now, we essentially do a single iteration to determine negative data. This could perhaps be preceded by a round of refactoring to clean up model training and make it less procedural.; - [ ] Automatic threshold tuning could be built into the tool, see #7711. We'd probably have to introduce a ""validation"" label. Perhaps it makes sense to keep this sort of thing at the workflow level?; - [ ] In the positive-negative framework enforced by the Java code in this tool, a ""model"" is anything that assigns a score, we fit two models to different subsets of the data, and then take the difference of the two scores.

Deployability,"UPDATE: @lbergelson and I started creating this as an extension to SplitIntervals, but it quickly because very complex to fit it into that framework/abstraction so we decided to create a specialized tool for GVS. It would be valuable for SplitIntervals to be able to split intervals based not on number of genomic bases, but by using a set of weights. Ideally this new mode would read in a BED file containing the weights in the score field and attempt to produce a series of intervals that have equal total weights. . Note: ` --dont-mix-contigs` should still continue to work. ** Why? **; In the Genomic Variant Store, we have found that scattering work by ""# of genomic bases"" does not lead to even runtimes for the shards. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1423491/147964102-d2c83dea-8486-4699-9e7a-eef3dc759732.png).

Deployability,"Update on the gene list format discussion: We recently in added GFF3 support in HTSJDK and one possible path forwards for supporting more general gene list formate for DoC would be to leverage the existing implementation that was included in #6602 to allow a second source of gene objects. This could be trivially implemented if we wanted to follow the same approach as #6602 where we simply farm the decision about what feature type is important out to the user to specify. This would mean that if the user cares about genes they could specify a count for each gene object with its reported boundaries that would be output as a line. This is similar but not analogous to the current behavior for the existing gene lists where we take pains to exclude from the overlap counts bases that are intronic bases in the gene list. . Unfortunately, since the GFF3 format is hierarchical and supports a very large number of feature types it will be very difficult to extract the intron/exon boundaries without properly parsing the GFF3 format. The GFF3 format supports .obo files that lay out the feature hierarchy and through parsing of that format it would be possible to extract intron/exon boundaries but that is not currently supported by HTSJDK and would involve us merging https://github.com/kachulis/htsjdk/tree/ck_gff3_feature_evaluator first in order to support and then on top of that coming up with some rules for deciding what units exactly make up a gene that should be merged for coverage counting. . I see a few options going forwards:; - We could support GFF3 gene lists with hard coded genes/CDS features to be included. This is brittle given that there are a number of more specific names for CDS (coding sequence) exons in genes that might end up being excluded.; - We could support GFF3 format but ignore exon sequences which would mean that the behavior for counting the same genes will vary depending on which format the gene is provided.; - We could support GFF3 gene lists but allow th",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6491#issuecomment-683963413:0,Update,Update,0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6491#issuecomment-683963413,1,['Update'],['Update']

Deployability,"Update: I made a list of particularly bad intervals for the DREAM4 and 20-plex Hapmap bams by scattering 500 ways, choosing the 20 slowest jobs (weighting by an empirical 3x slowness factor for jobs on nodes that couldn't use AVX PairHMM acceleration), scattering again etc to obtain 100 or so intervals of roughly 200 bp that took long. Then I confirmed that the slowness had nothing to do with SGE or cromwell (it shouldn't, because I was getting runtime from the GATK output log, not the cromwell log, but just in case. . .) by re-running each interval on gsa5. In *every* case, the slow intervals had extremely deep coverage (2,000 - 30,000) due to mapping error. Even after filtering to MQ == 60, the high coverage usually remained, although it often decreased significantly. In addition to the extreme depth, the only other sign was a significant proportion of reads with multiple SNVs relative to the reference. Unfortunately, something cheap to compute, like CIGAR complexity, was often not a sign, because many CIGARs were eg 101M, with many of the M's coming from SNVs. One quick solution would be to completely skip calling on regions with extremely high depth. It's hard to imagine being able to trust any calls from them. Another option is MQ-based downsampling, for example downsampling to the 1000 reads with the best MQ. Some people might like the downsampling option for the secure feeling of not losing sensitivity, although realistically those regions are so terrible that this security is an illusion. The only real protection is a more complete reference.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2975#issuecomment-309565338:0,Update,Update,0,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2975#issuecomment-309565338,1,['Update'],['Update']

Deployability,"Update: after some offline discussion, we found that this was a two-fold issue that has since been fixed.; 1. END was set to END2 in some older VCFs from GATK-SV, so it represented the breakpoint on the second chromosome rather than the first. This has been fixed - multiple more recent GATK-SV VCFs were found to have the correct values for END for CTX events; 2. Older versions of SVAnnotate annotated the interval CHROM:POS-END for CTX, expecting END to be very close to POS. This produced incorrect intervals when END was set to END2, which could be very large, resulting in long lists of genes under PREDICTED_LOF. This has been fixed in #8693 so SVAnnotate now independently annotates breakpoints at CHROM:POS and CHROM:END for CTX. For other users encountering this issue in their VCFs produced by older versions of GATK-SV, I recommend rerunning CleanVcf and AnnotateVcf with the latest versions of GATK-SV. A more manual alternative that requires less re-running of workflows would be: ; 1. Extract CTX SVs; 2. Set END to POS; 4. Strip out functional consequence annotations; 5.

User reports a workaround solution of adding `-Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US` to commands but this is cumbersome. . Should our tools should be internationally compatible?. ---; Hi @shlee, @slee,. yes it is working when I replace the commas with points, but since I am using the wdl-pipeline which was provided by slee on gitHub, this is not a sufficient workaround. Due to my expectation that the problem (commas instead of points) arise from my language settings I try different thing to change my actual language on the system. To make the long story short the solution was to start CalculateTargetCoverage with the flags (I added them in the cnv_somatic_tasks.wdl):; ```; java -Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US -Xmx${default=4 mem}g -jar ${gatk_jar} CalculateTargetCoverage; ```; And now the cnv_somatic_panel_workflow.wdl runs smoothly to the end, with points instead of commas :).

I don't know, how to use multithreads (e.g. -nct) for GATK 4 version to reduce the execution time on the single node. Because, we have 32 cores per node with 512GB memory available for benchmarking. To parallelize the GATK 4 workload, I used the Spark version also. . I used **GATK 4 Beta2 Spark job on the cluster of 32 nodes** (32 nodes x 32 cores, totaling 1024 cores). The execution time is almost same as GATK 4 Beta2 ( 50 Hours, 21 min). Please help me, how to reduce the execution time for GATK 4 Beta2 HaplotypeCaller? .

Deployability,"User says beta 2 is much faster than release. . ----; User Report; ----; Hi @Geraldine_VdAuwera , thanks for the quick response!. We used CCLE WES FASTQs for the purpose of testing (6GB per paired end). We scattered the tool using a custom BED file with 86 intervals. 4.0.0.0 failed due to memory with 2GB per job. It completed with 4GB per job. Each job lasted approximately 1h 10 min. 4.beta.2 completed with 2GB per job and each job lasted approximately 5m. This is in gVCF mode, with the same settings as described above. All input files, settings and hardware are the same between versions.

Deployability,"Usually when we see silent failures like what's happening in singularity, it's due to an out of memory error that results in the JVM process being rudely killed before it can output an error message. It's possible that's what's happening there. If you're running in a container with a limited memory pool, you have to be sure to set the java memory explicitly with -Xmx, but also be sure to leave some memory left over for the system and for native code invoked by java. For example, if you have a container with 8G of memory available I would set -Xmx7g to leave a bit of overhead available. .

A USER ERROR has occurred: This GVCF contained overlapping reference blocks.

This error should be generally helpful, but it appears that the interval that is reported in the error message is the _last_ overlapping interval, not the _first_.

The retry settings were not being correctly propagated to `google-cloud-java` for this particular tool (`GenomicsDBImport`), and so it was running with the default settings of `maxChannelReopens == 0 and maxRetries == 3`. This also explains why we resolved the issue with 503's (which are handled by the retries), but not the SSL errors (which are handled by the reopens). We are currently working on a patch to fix this. We could guard ourselves against this sort of issue in the future by implementing https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3120 (the ability to set retry settings globally for the `google-cloud-java` library, rather than per-Path).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2685#issuecomment-309098253:517,patch,patch,517,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2685#issuecomment-309098253,1,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,"We can split the tests up into a bunch of build units, but we get rapidly diminishing returns since we spend minutes installing things and building the artifacts for every vm. Travis doesn't have any notion of a build pipeline, so we can't say ""build the artifact on 1 vm and then share it and run the tests on these 10 vms"". Since we have a hard limit of the number of VMs we can use at a time for DSDE ( currently 15) being less efficient is very bad news. ( We could of course pay for more... I recently asked travis support if we could switch to an unlimited pay for usage model and they said no. ) We could also try optimizing wasted vm time by prebuilding dockers to run in, but that's additional complication. (maybe not to much, might be worth it). We also would need a scheme for dividing tests evenly between VM's. I tried writing a testng test listener to distribute them between N nodes based on the hashcode of the test class, for use on circleci, but it fell over and exploded for some reason that I never debugged. We could either debug it, or possibly split the tests by splitting the list of test files and then passing those in specifically. (May run into character limits for command lines... ). Balancing it is going to be tricky though in any case since the tests are very unevenly expensive. (We could probably manually balance it since there are a small number of slow tests and the rest are so fast they don't really matter) . The easiest thing would be to set the test to run in parallel on their existing vm. I can try turning it on again. I remember it caused problems before though, which I assume we haven't addressed. Each vm has 2 cores, so we might see some speedup. I suspect we may be using both cores to some degree already, since performance nearly doubled when we switched from the 1 core to 2 core build machines.

There is a forum discussion to this effect:. https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/23230/gatk-haplotypecaller-mnp-output-problem. Here are the parameters we use:. * match: 200; * substitution: -150; * indel start: -260; * indel extend: -11. These parameters, which are essentially a prior on biological variation, prefer an indel, with a cost of 260, to a SNP, with a cost of 350. This does not seem correct.

Deployability,"We recommend backing up data just because it is the ""cleanest"" way to roll back. If backing up data is really such a pain point, you could skip doing that. Just back up the callset.json file, and don't turn on `--consolidate` when you're doing incremental import. If a failure happens, just roll back the callset.json and re-do the import. The downside is that the failed import will hang around and take up disk space, but hopefully it is a rare enough occurrence that it doesn't matter - and you will have saved yourself backing up the data. In response to 2) - I guess you're implying that the overhead of cluster/job scheduling won't amortize any benefits from parallelism there? I suppose that could be true, but doesn't seem to be worth optimizing towards that. What I'm asking is whether split and merge are purely an instrument to allow you to choose the granularity of parallelism you want to use? Or is there something else? As I said before, we are considering enabling other ways to do distributed import which would work for the former. It might go something like:; - Create a workspace/initialize configuration+intervals to be imported; - Actually do the import by kicking off (multiple) import(s). User can pick the number of intervals each import is responsible for. User must ensure that no interval gets specified in multiple import processes. P.S: regarding 1000s of small contigs - the current GenomicsDBImport doesn't so so well with large number of contigs (unless you do concatenate the contigs into fewer groups). We hope to have some changes coming soon that will help with that by adding an option for the tool to merge multiple contigs into a single folder in the workspace.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6620#issuecomment-641037548:1111,configurat,configuration,1111,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6620#issuecomment-641037548,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"Well, you're welcome to use gatk-launch as a launch script if you'd like (and feel free to rename to whatever you like...) A. There are a few reasons we have spark and non-spark versions of the tools. . 1. We wanted to port and validate certain tools as quickly as possible and doing a direct port from gatk3 -> gatk4 was easier than making them sparkified at the same time. 2. There's a tradeoff in using spark where you end up spending more total cpu hours in order to finish a job faster. Ideally this would be 1:1, double the number of cores and you halve the time to finish a job. It never scales perfectly though, there's always some overhead for being parallel. Our production pipelines are extremely sensitive to cost and not very sensitive to runtime, so they prefer we have a version that's optimized to use the least cpu hours even if that means a longer runtime. Other users prefer to be able to finish a job quickly and are willing to pay slightly more to do so, so we also have a spark version. . 3. Some tool are complicated to make work well spark. Spark works best when you can divide the input data into independent shards and then process them separately. This is complicated for things like the AssemblyRegion walker where you need context around each location of interest. We had to do things like add extra overlapping padding and things like that to avoid boundary issues where there are shard divisions. We don't yet fully understand spark performance and it's caveats, we're looking into that actively now. We hope that we'll be able to optimize our tools so that a spark pipeline of several tools in series is faster than running the individual non-spark versions, since it lets us avoid doing things like loading the bam file multiple times from disk. Whether or not we can achieve this is still and open question though.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2345#issuecomment-273318100:684,pipeline,pipelines,684,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2345#issuecomment-273318100,2,['pipeline'],"['pipeline', 'pipelines']"

Anyway I will try to be clearer with this picture:. ![](https://us.v-cdn.net/5019796/uploads/editor/3x/9bu9fsvbgjrh.png """"). as you can see I would like to combine the tools `BwaAndMarkDuplicatesPipelineSpark` and `BQSRPipelineSpark` in one single tool, in order to improve efficiency of the pipeline (avoiding for example a disk writing). ; I tried to do it with [this](https://pastebin.com/XEqvpKmG ""this"") naive approach as I reported in previous comments, but executing this code I obtain this error (as you can see at the end of this [stack-trace](https://paste.ee/p/dMod1 ""stack-trace"") ) : ; ```; 17/11/03 13:02:14 ERROR Utils: Aborting task; java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Reference index for 'chr11' not found in sequence dictionary.; ```.

Deployability,What is the source of the GTF file you are using? It look like the issue you are seeing has to do with the parsing of your new GTF file. The GTF codec in GATK4 is bespoke and designed to handle GencodeGTF files specifically and expects some specific fields to be present in all records which looks to be what is causing problems for you right here (this will be subject to change in the next release to some extent). It expects that gene feature object comes first in the order of family gene elements and it also requires that all of the gene transcript/exome families are and appear together as a group. . Its hard to say without seeing your GTF file but if it is coordinate sorted this could happen or it could also happen if its is mis-formatted and elements are not hierarchically organized into gene -> transcripts -> exons-> features.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8394#issuecomment-1613357793:392,release,release,392,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8394#issuecomment-1613357793,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"Wow, thanks for the detailed comments so far, @davidbenjamin! But perhaps let's quickly chat before you go any further?. There are a lot of things you commented on---temporary integration tests using local files, lots of code/arguments/etc. intentionally copied verbatim over from VQSR/tranches, and entire tools (the ""monolithic"" GMMVariantTrain and ScikitLearnVariantTrain)---that are rather in flux or will be scrapped/cleaned up shortly. That said, the comments on the code inherited from VQSR will certainly be useful in this process!. But it might save you some time if we could chat so I can give you a rough orientation and perhaps point out where the vestigial VQSR code remains. I think focusing discussion on the high level design of the tools that are likely to stay would also be most useful at this stage. Feel free to throw something on my calendar!. In the end, I think we will probably just retain the BGMM backend + the versions of the tools in the ""scalable"" package. I left the ""monolithic"" GMMVariantTrain and ScikitLearnVariantTrain tools in this branch so I could do one round of tieout. That tieout came out OK, so I think we'll abandon the monolithic tools, along with all the associated code outside of the scalable package.

A naive calculation of the relative X ploidy, i.e. calculating X_pcov = (X_total_read_counts / autosome_total_read_count) for all samples, performing a 2-mean clustering, and dividing the X_pcov by the lower ploidy cluster mean reveals that indeed, the X conting has twice more coverage on _average_ in XX samples:; ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15305869/26426348/2b2d6982-40a6-11e7-8eca-e93916bfc80c.png). Further investigation shows that the wrong behavior of TargetCoverageSexGenotyper stems from the lack of robustness of Poisson regression to outliers: there are a number of targets in the X contig with anomalously high coverage (200x median!). In the absence of Y coverage data (and bias adjustment), higher ploidy genotypes are always favored (in this case, XX). Solution: either filter read counts for outliers before calculating Poisson log likelihoods, or simply use the naive median-based ploidy estimates and perform genotyping on the estimated ploidies (rather than target-resolved read counts). The latter is proven to be robust to outliers. Update: it turns out that the issue can be fixed by simply taking into account bait count as a multiplicative bias. Otherwise, the distribution of raw read counts is multimodal and far from Poisson:; ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15305869/26516437/54da4930-4254-11e7-9093-5e5fe1e0e28e.png).

Deployability,"Yeah - there is a limited set of allowed values for `GeneTranscriptType` and the one in this particular Mouse transcript (`IG_D_pseudogene`) is not among them. The values for `GeneTranscriptType` were modeled off the human Gencode files, but the GTF spec allows for arbitrary values in that field. I talked with @jamesemery about this and it ultimately comes down to my want for Funcotator to fail rather than produce bad / erroneous annotations. The parsers / codecs will need to be updated to allow for arbitrary values in this field, and the parser should be reviewed for other fields that allow for this as well.

There is another implementation that I considered - base the remaining time on the time it has taken for the last `N` updates. This would account for bursty processing times, but would also result in wildly fluctuating estimates (because it would still assume a uniform distribution of data). We cam also do something like this with a sliding window average to smooth it out. If you prefer another implementation I can change it, but again - something is better than nothing. .

Deployability,"Yeah, the goofy name is just a placeholder, as is the separate tool itself. Unless there are any objections (@fleharty @mwalker174?) or I run into any unforeseen snafus or parameter ambiguities along the way, I am going to roll the multisample-segmentation functionality into ModelSegments. We can toggle this functionality by passing multiple `--denoised-copy-ratios` and `--allelic-counts` arguments, e.g.:. ```; gatk ModelSegments ; --normal-allelic-counts normal.allelicCounts.tsv (this is only used for het genotyping); --denoised-copy-ratios normal.denoisedCR.tsv; --denoised-copy-ratios tumor-1.denoisedCR.tsv; ...; --denoised-copy-ratios tumor-N.denoisedCR.tsv; --allelic-counts normal.allelicCounts.tsv; --allelic-counts tumor-1.allelicCounts.tsv; ...; --allelic-counts tumor-N.allelicCounts.tsv \; -O .; --output-prefix joint-segmentation; ```. This will perform both het genotyping and joint segmentation, but will yield a Picard interval-list `joint-segmentation.interval_list` as its sole output. (Although we could proceed to perform MCMC model inference on each sample in series, we'll stop at segmentation to enforce the scattering of inference across samples, which will be quicker.) We can also allow for copy-ratio-only and allelic-count-only modes. Users can use this joint segmentation in their own downstream tools, but we can also allow ModelSegments to ingest it via in a new `--segments` argument:. ```; gatk ModelSegments; --normal-allelic-counts normal.allelicCounts.tsv (equivalently, we could omit this and adjust minimum-total-allele-count-case, as is done in the WDL); --allelic-counts normal.allelicCounts.tsv; --denoised-copy-ratios normal.denoisedCR.tsv; --segments joint-segmentation.interval_list; -O .; --output-prefix normal. gatk ModelSegments; --normal-allelic-counts normal.allelicCounts.tsv; --allelic-counts tumor-1.allelicCounts.tsv; --denoised-copy-ratios tumor-1.denoisedCR.tsv; --segments joint-segmentation.interval_list; -O .; --output-prefix tumor-1.

Deployability,"Yep, right now that's what would happen. The previous behavior was that GenomicsDB would return likelihoods for up to 50 alts and then no likelihoods for more than 50 and GenotypeGVCFs I think would subset 7-49 ALTs down to 6 and drop sites with more than 50 ALTs, which is sort of the computational efficiency compromise. I personally don't trust a diploid site with 50 ALTs. I believe the old CombineGVCFs behavior capped the number of likelihoods, so ploidy 1 could have more than 50 ALTs, but higher ploidies would have fewer. So the current plan is to separate the max alts for GGVCFs and GenomicsDB so that the GenomicsDB max alts to combine can be greater and thus convey enough information for GGVCFs to subset down to its max alts, if desired. But if you want to be conservative with memory, you could set them to be equal and low.

Here's one I answered just last week: http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/comment/39359#Comment_39359. So it appears that it is a step that folks continue to use. . I would add that indel realignment is especially important for Mutect1 pipelines, which continues as the standard in somatic calling, pending performance of Mutect2. Even if Mutect2 were to outperform Mutect1 calling, because of the extreme difference in compute between the two, I conjecture folks will continue to use Mutect1. In fact, the only sane way to output a BAM for the entirety of a somatic sample set is via indel realignment. Somatic folks are keen on manual review and indel realignment is the cheapest way to get there. Here's another scenerio for which indel realignment is useful: the case of a low coverage site where multiple haplotypes are present. These cannot be resolved by HaplotypeCaller if the difference in allele depth between reads supporting either haplotype does not pass some threshold. In this case, sites receive `./.` no calls. Indel realignment using a known sites resource can aid in the resolution of haplotypes at sites that correspond to common population variants. One could argue that the cohort-level analysis could aid in resolution of these, but it may be that large cohorts are a luxury that cannot be afforded by many research groups. ### I vote yes please to porting the indel realignment pipeline.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3084#issuecomment-307895094:33,continuous,continuous,33,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3084#issuecomment-307895094,3,"['continuous', 'pipeline']","['continuous', 'pipeline', 'pipelines']"

Deployability,"Your interpretation sounds right, although I wish the language in the SAM spec were clearer - something like ""if 0x1 is unset, fields 0x2, 0x8, 0x20, 0x40, and 0x80 have no meaning and are ignored by the tools"". SAMRecord.IsValid() returns errors not only for 0x8(mate unmapped)/unpaired read, but also for the other four fields, so all of these errors would need to be removed. IsValid() also triggers an error when an unpaired read has RNEXT set, but the spec. ; doesn't appear to exclude this error. No error is triggered for the unpaired/PNEXT case. . So I agree that it looks like IsValid() should be changed to align with the spec. But I can also imagine potential pitfalls of leaving the GenomicsConverter code the way it is. The code adds spurious information to the bam that might cause problems with legacy versions of the tools. I don't know what the plans are for the state of the existing tool distribution once gatk4 is released. Is it possible that bam files produced in the cloud could make their way into gatk3 workflows, maybe via the sharing of bams between groups? If this happens, then unpaired reads processed in the cloud, with their mate unpaired flags set by the converter, could trigger validation errors when they are fed to the legacy tools.

Deployability,"Yup, as you might recall from some discussions with @bhanugandham and @mwalker174, getting automated pipeline-level CNV evaluations up and running was highest on my list before I handed over the role and went on paternity leave. I think these tests would be more useful than unit/integration tests for correctness, but they would almost certainly have to run on CARROT. That said, the current level of unit/integration test coverage is a bit different from that for the somatic tools, because 1) it's difficult to run gCNV in any useful way on Travis infrastructure, and 2) we hadn't decided on a framework/convention for python unit tests at the time the production code went in (although I think @ldgauthier has added some python unit tests by now). So we currently only have plumbing WDL/integration tests on very small data for gCNV---and these only test that the tools run, not for correctness. For somatic CNV, we have unit tests for correctness on small simulated data (e.g., for things like segmentation and modeling classes), but integration tests don't cover correctness (and it would be pretty redundant to use the same simulated data for integration, so I'd rather put effort towards pipeline-level tests on real data).

Deployability,"[Tag 4.2.4.0](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases/tag/) doesn't appear to address the fact that WDLs still reference older GATK Docker images and therefore are still vulnerable. This is a quick replacement of all references to outdated GATK images that I could find in this repo's WDLs and WDL-specific JSONs. Note that these changes may be breaking, especially for older workflows; I do not have the bandwidth to individually test each one. The following images were not updated as I couldn't find a suitable replacement, although I suspect several could be replaced with the standard GATK image; * pkrusche/hap.py (I'm not sure this would even be affected by the vulnerability); * broad-gotc-prod/genomes-in-the-cloud; * gatksv/sv-base-mini -- referenced as gatksv/sv-base-mini:b3af2e3 in joint_call_exome_cnvs.wdl; * broadinstitute/oncotator -- referenced as broadinstitute/oncotator:1.9.5.0-eval-gatk-protected in cnv_somatic_oncotator_workflow.wdl, but is a fallback option; * us.gcr.io/broad-dsde-methods/haplochecker; * us.gcr.io/broad-gotc-prod/genomes-in-the-cloud:2.4.2-1552931386.

Hi, I used GenomicsDBImport to combined 2000 GVCFs. To speed up, I split the bed file and concatenated multiple intervals into a contig. I also met the file locking problem which can be solved by setting  TILEDB\_DISABLE\_FILE\_LOCKING=1 in my Linux system. Currently, I experience some issues with GenotypeGVCFs in GATK version 4.0.3.0. It cannot open ""genomicsdb\_array"" although the directory of genomicsdb\_array does exist.

I was wondering that how do I fix the issues with GATK 4.0.3.0? Does anyone have a better solution?. I also tried GenotypeGVCFs in GATK 4.2.1.0, but there is a problem in terms of MQ calculation. So I think it's better to stick to the same GATK version in the whole workflow.

However, it can be imagined the homologous sequences flanking the G's are not exactly the same, or may not be the same length (small indels), and the alignments would contain small gaps in their CIGARs. By assuming the homologous sequence are of the same length, which is what we are doing now, we could get the breakpoint location wrong. This is generally not a serious problem, but when the accumulated gap sizes are large enough, we can end up too-far off. A similar issue is when inferring SVLEN for small tandem duplications, where we are assuming the extra copies have the same length.

Deployability,"added to the instructions on the GATK Github README.md. If gcc is not installed, HaplotypeCaller complains that the AVX instruction set is not available, even when it is. It falls back to slower LOGLESS_CACHING PairHMM. The fault is missing libgomp1, which is a required dependency of gcc. Since this documentation request is related to a ""bug"" that comes about from not installing necessary libraries, I'll include the bug report format below, in case someone else searches for solutions to this problem, as suggested by @lbergelson. ### Affected tool(s) or class(es); _HaplotypeCaller_, or any other tool that uses _PairHMM_. ### Affected version(s); -I think all as of _2019-06-20_. I tested on release version _4.1.2.0_. #### Steps to reproduce; Run HaplotypeCaller from a released jar on an Ubuntu VM that supports the AVX instruction set. Critically, do *NOT* install gcc on the VM. Installing gcc fixes this problem. #### Expected behavior; If you install gcc, that results in the installation of libgomp1, which allows the Intel library to load and use AVX acceleration.

An alternative approach would be to use branching and cherry-picking to do this kind of selective release, or split the GATK into even more repositories, but I'm not sure those approaches would be preferable. ---. @droazen commented on [Thu Apr 28 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215491991). This came out of a discussion between myself and @LeeTL1220 . ---. @lbergelson commented on [Thu Apr 28 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215493945). So a gatk release would contain different sets of tools sometimes? Wouldn't that be confusing? It seems like it would be better to always release different jars, or version sets of tools independently and release jars with the latest good release of each individual set of tools. ---. @droazen commented on [Thu Apr 28 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215494432). @lbergelson Well, we definitely still want there to be releases of the GATK toolkit in its entirety. If the CNV tools need to be released more frequently than this, they could be versioned/released separately and periodically incorporated into the toolkit-wide releases. ---. @droazen commented on [Thu Apr 28 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215495326). To be clear, though, this is very much still in the ""throwing out ideas for discussion"" phase, and alternate proposals are welcome provided they include the concept of a GATK-wide release, and make some provision for the situation where the CNV tools (or some other sub-category) are ready for release but other tools are not. ---. @vdauwera commented on [Thu Apr 28 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215498517).

Deployability,"and likely to require some iteration so I'd be ok with starting with just the minimal ""porting"" changes to keep things simple, and then doing a code hygiene pass at the end. The ""porting"" changes should include things like updated javadoc, GATK4-style command line arguments, updating of outdated GATK3 terminology such as ""ROD"", Utils.nonNull assertions, etc. The finals and curly braces can wait for a separate pass (we will want to do those in this PR though). If you're not sure what to include or not just ask. I like the idea of keeping the GATK3 tests working as we go along. We should make a clear distinction between the old and new tests though. Ideally the GATK3 tests would be in a separate commit that we can just delete at the end, but that can get unwieldy if the files in the commit need to change as we go along. Alternatively you could isolate them into a separate directory. They should either be disabled or made dependent on a test method (see the `@Test` annotation properties `enabled` and `dependsOn`) that is easily toggled so they can be run locally, but don't run on the CI server. Otherwise the CI server build will always fail. In general, its really helpful to have the first commit in the PR contain the completely unmodified GATK3 source files. It makes it much easier for the reviewer to see what changed for the port. I noticed that you have 2 new plugins included in this. I'm not sure if that was suggested by someone on the GATK team (I'm wondering if we want to go down that path...) but I can tell you that the existing plugins required an enormous amount of test development and review iteration. If we do decide to make them plugins, I think it would be a good idea to do so in a separate PR. Also, if we choose to make an AbstractPlugin base class, we may want that to live in the Barclay repo. As @magicdgs points out, master already has your previous commits, so you should start by rebasing on that.

The ambitious version is to write our own simple aligner, eg a kmer-based method like BLAT or BBMap but with all the messy parts for handling big indels, RNA, and proteins removed. Writing our own BWA aligner would be wildly impractical. @takutosato @LeeTL1220 keeping you in the loop. ---. @davidbenjamin commented on [Thu Jan 26 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/844#issuecomment-275483449). *Even better*: rely on someone else in the group, such as Ted, to write a Java binding for BWA in memory. See broadinstitute/gatk#2367. ---. @davidbenjamin commented on [Sun Apr 23 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/844#issuecomment-296515266). So. . . given that our pipeline aligns with BWA, it might seem like this is just a redundant and laborious rehashing of the mapping quality score. *However*, the mapping quality only considers multi-mapping within the reference, and therefore doesn't account for mapping errors due to incompleteness of the reference. That is, reads from genomic regions that are not part of the reference (because they're hard to assemble, like centromeres etc) might map well to a unique regions within the reference, and therefore will have fine mapping quality even though they are artifacts. There are published ""decoy genomes"" -- essentially pseudo-contigs of regions missing from the reference, and mapping with BWA in memory to *those* might be very helpful. So, we need to: 1) get our hands on a decoy genome that will play nicely with BWA, and 2) talk to the SV team. ---. @ldgauthier commented on [Mon Apr 24 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/844#issuecomment-296675311).

Deployability,"aps pushing a fresh branch to this repo might make it a little easier for us to check it out for review---again, not a big deal, so I'll leave it up to you. 2) We try to adhere to the Google style guide https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html, so the review may yield a lot of seemingly minor and nitpicky change requests. Don't take these personally---the goal is just to make the code base as uniform and easy to maintain as possible! If you prefer, I'm sure we can find a GATK developer to take a quick once over of your branch and make these minor changes. 3) Since the new tool borrows so heavily from CollectAllelicCounts, I think it might be worth consolidating shared code and reducing code duplication---again, with the goal of making future maintenance more straightforward. I'll try to identify some places this can be done during my review. Again, we can make these changes on our end during the once over, or you can address them after the review (or we could also do this on our end in a separate PR after this one goes in). 4) In the near future, I think we should finally make the effort to replace both GetPileupSummaries and CollectAllelicCounts with this new tool. As mentioned in our email thread, @davidbenjamin and I discussed this long ago, e.g. https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4717#issuecomment-386734926. From a methods perspective, we'd simply need expand the current functionality of your tool to also report the reference allele and do some quick sanity checks to make sure that the differences in count definition and read filtering don't have any undesired downstream effects. However, as we also discussed, this will come with some additional overhead---we'll need to update documentation, workshop slides, tutorials, WDLs, and make sure that any changes in output formats are clearly highlighted in the release notes. I'll leave this effort to @davidbenjamin and @mwalker174. Thanks again for doing this. Let us know how you'd like to proceed!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6543#issuecomment-610462293:2075,update,update,2075,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6543#issuecomment-610462293,2,"['release', 'update']","['release', 'update']"

Deployability,"ated a new SpanningDeletionRecord as a subclass of ReferenceRecord but allows us to store GT and GQ; 2. in handlePotentialSpanningDeletion when processing a deletion, we create a new SpanningDeletionRecord with the correct GT and GQ based on the deletion; 3. When processing reference data at a variant site, return ReferenceRecords/SpanningDeletionRecord instead of just a string ""state"" since we need more than just state now; 4. Because of the above, we are now returning an object for the inferred state instead of just a string. Since the inferred state is so, so common a singleton InferredReferenceRecord was created; 5. Processing of spanning deletions beyond. **Ugly**; 1. The construction of the singleton is ugly because it _requires_ a location even though we don't for this case. We could go to an tagging interface (like Cloneable) these all implement, but that seems ugly also. *Refactoring Changes*; One of the challenges with this PR was testing as the work is really done in the lower-level methods and it would be nice to have this as a unit test rather than an integration/end-to-end test. This motivated the following changes:. 1. don't write to VCF directly, instead have take a Consumer<VariantContext> to emit VariantContexts. This let's us provide a different consumer in unit tests to collect our result.; 2. we previously had a chain of calls createVariantsFromSortedRanges -> processSampleRecordsForLocation -> finalizeCurrentVariant that returned void and as a side effect wrote to VCF. These deeper methods now return a VariantContext and the writing (via consumer) is done higher up in the call stack; 3. made some private methods package-private so we could call them from tests. **Thinking Out Loud**. We have three different sets of datastructures for the same data, some of this is history, some is performance/memory, but could use some rethinking; 1. GenericRecord (pulling from BQ); 2.

Takes <2 minutes for ~1000 iterations for each sample, can run 100s of samples in parallel on the gsa clusters.; - Need to write up some scripts to automatically calculate and plot metrics.; - [x] Evaluate algorithm on real data; - Some initial runs on HCC1143 purity series show reasonable results for the clonal model, i.e., purity is recovered within credible intervals (question: what are the error bars on the purities of the samples?). Subclonal performance is a little less clear due to 1) no real ground truth, 2) events in the normal, and 3) lack of outlier absorption.; - Can we get a hold of some cleaner purity series?; - [ ] Document algorithm in technical whitepaper. ---. @samuelklee commented on [Thu Dec 08 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/750#issuecomment-265798051). The first release of this tool will most likely include the following:. - Some refactoring to MCMC package and addition of an EnsembleSampler, which implements affine-invariant ensemble sampling from Goodman & Weare 2010 (this is the same method used by the emcee python package). This method is critical for sampling our highly multimodal posterior well. - Output of 1) all population fraction / ploidy MCMC samples, and 2) average variant profile and 3) posterior summaries at the posterior mode (determined by naive binning of samples). - No plotting. Early next quarter:. - [ ] Unit tests for EnsembleSampler. - [ ] Allowing for >1 tumor population. The model already allows for this, but some performance optimization of the variant-profile sampling step will probably be required. - [ ] Evaluation on BAMs prepared with mixing scripts. - [ ] Writeup of model in technical white paper. - [ ] Tool to produce interactive plots.

This PR also does:; * refactoring of `FindBreakpointEvidenceSpark` and `DiscoverVariantsFromContigAlignmentsSpark` to accommodate the new tool; * added three integration test (dummy in the sense that it only makes sure they run, and no correctness check on the output) for the three tools. Known differences:. * For NA12878 test sample: The `FindBreakpointEvidenceSpark`->`DiscoverVariantsFromContigAlignmentsSpark` generated VCF and `StructuralVariationDiscoveryPipelineSpark` generated VCF differ by how supplementary alignment's soft clipping is treated. The `FindBreakpointEvidenceSpark`->`DiscoverVariantsFromContigAlignmentsSpark` path has an optimization turned on that soft clipped bases for supplementary alignments are hard clipped away (no contig sequence is lost as it is always saved in the primary alignment), so the CIGARs are a little different. As a consequence, the SAM file generated by the two routes also differ in this CIGAR and sequence part.; * For CHM test sample: The differences are more delicate and even master version yields slightly different results from run to run.

Hyperparameters changed were contained mostly only to `psi_t` parameter.; - We developed a clustering procedure that is based on coverage profile at the set of targets that are highly variable across different capture kits. ; - We found that filtering on a QS metric on a final callset significantly boosted the specificity while lowering sensitivity insignificantly.; - We developed a hyperparameter optimization framework prototype that could be used in a future for general optimizations of cost/performance parameters for all GATK pipelines.; - We resolved several memory issues that came up during validations. **A few issues were encountered along the way:**; - The sensitivity and specificity on multiallellic (common) sites was significantly lower than on rare events.; - Single target calling sensitivity was lower than 20%.; - Pipeline WDL required optimization in order to handle whole genome data, however these changes were not consolidated in the official WDL. **Currently the ongoing work is focused on the following:**; - Improving sensitivity/specificity of calls on common regions. One solution being tested involves setting a prior for common regions derived from a high quality callset.

Deployability,"c resources, it seems to me this is a full capitulation of the GATK developer team given a serious bug, especially in light of the fact that the team seems to have enough resources to continue working on Mutect3. Mutect2 has been one of the best performing variant callers of the last years and is a major reason for the Broad's good reputation in the oncology bioinformatics field. GATK and Mutect2 are used by hundreds of institutions in clinical practice, affecting thousands of real patients' lives. Almost all of these institutions are likely to use clinical WES assays due to cost reasons and will thus have been directly affected by this issue _for the last three years_. Also, almost all of these institutions will never learn of this bug since they likely trusted in the developers to have proper functional regression tests in place. If this is indeed the best the Broad can do as an institution, then I will take your offer of providing a build of Mutect2 4.1.8.1 with the log4j vulnerability patched out - thank you. The one thing that I am asking for in addition (for the sake of the overall oncology bioinformatics community), however, is that you conduct a best effort to notify organizations (universities, hospitals, and biotechs/pharmaceuticals that you know are using Mutect2) and best-practise workflow owners (Nextflow, Snakemake, WDL, CWL etc. that include Mutect2) of the forced downgrade. Also, I think it makes sense to include a very prominent warning into the Mutect2 READMEs and GATK best practice documentations and guides. I know that this is work, too, but with success comes responsibility, and I can just hope that providing proper warnings uses less developer bandwidth than applying binary search to find out which of these [10 commits between 4.1.8.1 and 4.1.9.0 that are touching variant filtering (see below)](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/compare/4.1.8.1...4.1.9.0) broke your flagship product enough to abandon it.

Deployability,"c. to `pytensor`/`pt`/etc. However, there were some more nontrivial changes, including to 1) model priors (since some of the distributions previously used were removed or are now supported differently), 2) the implementation of posterior sampling, 3) some shape/dimshuffle operations, and other things along these lines. Using a single test shard of 20 1kGP WES samples x 1000 intervals, I have verified determinism/reproducibility for DetermineGermlineContigPloidy COHORT/CASE modes, GermlineCNVCaller COHORT/CASE modes, and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls. Numerical results are also relatively close to those from 4.4.0.0 for all identifiable call and model quantities (albeit far outside any reasonable exact-match thresholds, most likely due to differences in RNG, sampling, and the aforementioned priors). Some remaining TODOs:. - [x] Rebuild and push the base Docker. EDIT: Mostly covered by #8610, but this also includes an addition of `libblas-dev`.; - [x] Update expected results for integration tests, perhaps add any that might be missing. EDIT: These were generated on WSL Ubuntu 20.04.2, we'll see if things pass on 22.04. Note that changing the ARD priors does change the *names* of the expected files, since the transform is appended to the corresponding variable name. DetermineGermlineContigPloidy and PostprocessGermlineCNVCalls are missing exact-match tests and should probably have some, but I'll leave that to someone else.; - [x] Update other python integration tests.; - [x] Clean up some of the changes to the priors.; - [x] Clean up some TODO comments that I left to track code changes that might result in changed numerics. I'll try to go through and convert these to PR comments in an initial review pass.; - [x] Test over multiple shards on WGS and WES. Probably some scientific tests on ~100 samples in both cohort and case mode would do the trick. We should also double check runtime/memory performance (I noted ~1.5x speedups, but didn't measure carefully; I also want to m",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8561#issuecomment-1847549285:1927,Update,Update,1927,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8561#issuecomment-1847549285,2,"['Update', 'integrat']","['Update', 'integration']"

(EDIT: I implemented this in a way that allows one to set the maximum number of values allowed per chunk, so that heap usage can be controlled, but the downside is that this translates into a corresponding limit on the number of columns (i.e., intervals). On the other hand, you could theoretically crank this number up to Integer.MAX_VALUE, as long as you set -Xmx high enough...

For now, I'll require that the coverage matrix can fit in RAM, but more sophisticated versions of the algorithm could be implemented in the future.; - [ ] Update methods doc. Note that some of the CNV section is out of date and incorrect.

Deployability,"commend for all experiments going forward. One concern I have is that our cluster memory is already far larger than; the input size. In fact here each machine can fit the whole input; comfortably in RAM. This is not going to be the case for the full input.; Since it would take too long to iterate using the full input, it seems wise; instead to reduce both the input size and to keep a close eye on the amount; of memory we're using to make sure we're not going down a path that would; not be able to cope with the full input.

Deployability,"consider combining this code (along with `AllelicCount`/`PileupSummary`) at some point.; - [x] Added option to use matched normal.; - [ ] Rather than port over the old modeling code, I would rather expand the allele-fraction model to allow for the modeling of hom sites. I wrote up such a model in some notes I sent around a few months back. This model allows for an allelic PoN that uses all sites to learn reference bias, not just hets. Depending on how our python development proceeds, I may try to implement this model using the old `GibbsSampler` code instead.; - [x] In the meantime, we can try to speed up the old allele-fraction model, which is now the main bottleneck. An easy (lazy) strategy might simply be to downsample and scale likelihoods when estimating global parameters. Addresses #2884.; - [x] Even though the simple copy-ratio model is much faster, it still takes ~15-20 minutes for 100 iterations on WGS, so we can downsample here too.; - [x] Integration tests are still needed; again, these might not test for correctness.; - I've added the ability to specify a prior for the minor-allele fraction, which alleviates the problem of residual bias in balanced segments.; - I've reduced the verbosity of the modeled-segments file. I only report posterior mode and 10%, 50%, and 90% deciles. Global parameters have the full deciles output in the .param files, but I removed the mode and highest density credible interval (because of the below item).; - [x] Some residual bias remains in the estimate of the minor-allele fraction posterior mode. This is simply because we are performing kernel density estimation of a bounded quantity. One possibility would be to logit transform to an unbounded support, perform the estimation, then transform back. EDIT: Just removed kernel density estimation for now, partly due to #3599 as well.; - Hmm, actually still a tiny bit of residual bias. This is apparent e.g. in WGS normals.

Deployability,"consistency loops. For example, consider the mean-field treatment of two coupled Markov chains: the mean-field decoupling of the two chains yields two independent Markov chains with effective emission, transition, and prior probabilities, all of which must be self-consistency determined. The internal admixing rate would be used to admix the old and new self-consistent fields across the two chains in order to dampen oscillations and improve convergence properties. Once internal convergence is achieved, the converged posteriors must be saved to a workspace in order to be consumed by the continuous sub-model. The new internally converged posteriors will be admixed with the old internally converged posteriors from the previous epoch with the _external_ admixing rate. - Introduced two-stage inference for cohort denoising and calling. In the first (""warm-up"") stage, discrete variables are marginalized out, yielding an effective continuous-only model. The warm-up stage calculates continuous posteriors based on the marginalized model. Once convergence is achieved, continuous and discrete variables are decoupled for the second (""main"") stage. The second stage starts with a discrete calling step (crucial), using continuous posteriors from the warm-up stage as the starting point. The motivation behind the two-stage inference strategy is to avoid getting trapped in spurious local minima that are potentially introduced by mean-field decoupling of discrete and continuous RVs. Note that mean-field decoupling has a tendency to stabilize local minima, most of which will disappear or turn into saddle points once correlations are taken into account. While the marginalized model is free of such spurious local minima, it does not yield discrete posteriors in a tractable way; hence, the necessity of ultimately decoupling in the ""main"" stage. - Capped phred-scaled qualities to maximum values permitted by machine precision in order to avoid NaNs and overflows. - Took a first step toward tr",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4720:1327,continuous,continuous,1327,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4720,1,['continuous'],['continuous']

See https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7954#discussion_r933570228.; - [ ] Add behavior for dealing with mixed SNP/INDEL sites in separate passes (and note that the current WDL currently does this, to allow for the use of different annotations across SNPs and INDELs). This might include rescuing previously filtered sites, etc. (e.g., by using the option to ignore the first-pass filter in the second pass). Alternatively, one could use a different FILTER name in each pass, which downstream hard-filtering steps could utilize intelligently. Or one might just split multiallelics upstream. In any case, I would hope that we could move towards running both SNPs and INDELs in a single pass with the same annotations as the default mode of operation.; - [ ] Clean up borrowed code in the `VariantType` class for classifying sites as SNP or INDEL. We mostly retained the VQSR code and logic to make head-to-head comparisons easier. Note also that we converted some switch statements to conditionals, etc. (which I think was done properly, but maybe I missed an edge case). See https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7954#discussion_r934776584.; - [ ] Think more about how to treat empty HDF5 arrays. It's possible we should handle this at the WDL level with optional inputs/outputs. Likely only relevant for atypical edge cases. See https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7954#discussion_r934845337. Next steps:. - [ ] I'll update the BGMM branch and open a PR.; - [ ] I'll start looking at implementing a simple CARROT test. We can just replicate the Cromwell/WDL test for now.; - [ ] Update that initial implementation with non-trivial data and evaluation scripts. EDIT: I see that #7982 was just filed.; - [ ] Implement a CARROT test with malaria data.

I've had a quick look at the code, and think the dubious value may be generated in [ReadPosition::getValueForRead](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/946f39/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/walkers/annotator/ReadPosition.java#L57) when the result from [ReadPosRankSumTest.getReadPosition](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/946f39/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/walkers/annotator/ReadPosRankSumTest.java#L53) is cast to an `int`. Looking at that function, it can [return `INVALID_ELEMENT_FROM_READ`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/946f39/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/walkers/annotator/ReadPosRankSumTest.java#L62) which is [defined as `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/946f39/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/tools/walkers/annotator/RankSumTest.java#L23). According to the [java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.3), casting NEGATIVE_INFINITY to int will result in a value of `INT_MIN`.

Also increase the kmer size to 35 does the job (-kmerSize 35) I guess that that prevents non-ref paths merge back into the reference between events thus resulting in less complex graphs. ---. @vruano commented on [Wed Dec 07 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1530#issuecomment-265535498). The user can be inform of using these work arounds (change the max number of haplotypes or kmersize) but those are not good solutions in general as he would pay a CPU and sensitivity penalty in other places. . ---. @vruano commented on [Wed Dec 07 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1530#issuecomment-265551340). I can see how the current best-path selection algorithm may fail to produce a good coverage of events across the active region depending on the weights on edges .... for some configurations the algorithm may dedicate too much time in exploring alternatives in one section of the graph because these are nearly equaly likely disregarding other possibilities other section just because they can only result in a relatively larger drop in the likelihood of the path. . I quick but elegant solution would be to simulate passes across the graph... first iterations would produce a quickly growing set of haplotypes but eventually repeated sampling would not produce new haplotypes. if after 100 subsequent simulations there is no new discovery or we have reached a limit (128?) we would stop there. This simulation approach could be implemented only in situations the graphs are too complex for an analytical solution. We can determine the maximum number of paths in a graph with a quick deep first traversal to decide whether to use the analytical-exact or the simulation-proximate approach. . ---. @vdauwera commented on [Mon Mar 20 2017](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1530#issuecomment-287813366).

Deployability,"d try to do it, as that is a relatively expensive resource to create. For example, some very naive hard filtering (red) of the histogram yields a peak that is easily fit by a negative binomial (green)---even a Poisson fit does not appear to bias the depth estimates, and certainly does not result in incorrect ploidy estimates:. ![masked_fit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/37863641-827a6e8a-2f37-11e8-83d5-cb4af32a898b.png). (Incidentally, it is helpful to plot on a log scale when checking the fit of these distributions.). This strategy also gives us a way to ignore low-level mosaicism or large germline events, which filtering on mappability may not address:. ![mosaic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11076296/37863649-d0ac378c-2f37-11e8-8e98-45e1fa9a3d7a.png). So let's try to encapsulate changes to the ploidy tool. I agree that the histogram creation can be easily done on the Java side, to save on intermediate file writing. We can probably just cap the maximum bin to `k` and pass a samples x contig TSV where each entry is a vector with `k + 1` elements. I agree that there is still a lot of important work to be done in exploring our best practices for coverage collection, and I know that you have been interested in improving them for a while. Ultimately, we may want to consider incorporating mappability or other informative metadata, as we've discussed. However, this will require some non-trivial investment in method/tool development time. Since our preliminary evaluations show that even with the current, naive strategies the tool is performing reasonably well, I am prioritizing cutting a release and improving/automating the evaluations. As we discussed, this will both allow users to start using the tool (which will hopefully result in useful feedback) and establish a baseline for us. This will ultimately provide the necessary foundation for future exploratory work and method development---which always takes more time than we think it will!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4558#issuecomment-375881040:2209,release,release,2209,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4558#issuecomment-375881040,1,['release'],['release']

As a bit of a background, I am trying to use the latest dbSNP release (build 155, GRCh38, GCF\_000001405.39) and have tried using GATK version 4.1.9.0 and the latest 4.2.0.0, both having the same problem. To prepare the dbSNP file for use with the best practices workflow, I renamed the NCBI chromosome accession numbers  to UCSC style names using bcftools annotate, updated the vcf headers using UpdateVcfSequenceDictionary, and indexed the file using IndexFeatureFile. The dbSNP file worked well with both HaplotypeCaller and GenotypeGVCFs, with the rsids overlapping perfectly with those obtained when using the dbSNP resource bundle version. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated!<br><br><i>(created from <a href='https://broadinstitute.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/171466'>Zendesk ticket #171466</a>)<br>gz#171466</i>",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7383:2185,release,release,2185,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7383,3,"['Update', 'release', 'update']","['UpdateVcfSequenceDictionary', 'release', 'updated']"

Deployability,"dian count is significantly away from the main peak (due to the abundance of low mappability bins with small counts). . Also, the second peak of chrX coverage in XY samples that you show above is not a large germline event -- it is simply a low mappable PAR-like region that borrows reads from chrY. Here's how the X coverage distribution looks like on an XY sample after mappability filtering (which removes most of all approximate homologies):; ![chrx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15305869/37867778-54e3d196-2f73-11e8-8345-d8964b39a17e.png). **The second spurious peak is gone and range of NB-like behavior is pretty much perfect. Without mappability filtering, all of the bins on the second mode _will_ show up as CN = 2 events (in fact, if you look at gCNV calls on a typical XY samples, there are tons of CN = 2 calls).**. Most, if not all, of the non-NB-like coverage before/after the main peak in your plots are reads from unmappable regions, many of which show up as real CNV events if we do not filter them (reads in these regions do not follow from the coverage model and we are at the mercy of BWA). I strongly believe Genome STRiP has achieved ~ 99% experimental validation accuracy because of aggressive filtering, not because of a superior model (it's an elementary Gaussian mixture mix). Garbage in, garbage out. Anyhow, I am not comfortable at all with cutting a non-Beta release without taking care of about:. 1. Mappability-based bin/read filtering (for WGS), and; 2. Trying out and evaluating a bait-based coverage collection (for WES), so that the raw coverage distribution is more NB-like to begin with. These are both perfectly achievable goals before May 15. I'd be happy to leave stuff such as different coverage collection strategies (e.g. base call coverage) and fragment-based per-sample GC content estimation for later. These are other areas where significant improvements come from.

Deployability,"ds but `VariantAnnotator` only has the reads. Several annotations had fallback code to annotate a likelihoods object that had no likelihoods. @vruano This is the class that you disliked so much in your recent code review of #5783 . A few issues with this state of things:. * Torturing the definition of `AlleleLikelihoods`, which forced the class to have methods like `hasLikelihoods()`.; * `VariantAnnotator` only applied the few annotations that had custom pileup-based fallback code.; * Lots more annotation code for the fallback mode. So the first step was the option that @lbergelson and @jamesemery liked most: create a regular likelihoods object in `VariantAnnotator` by hard-assigning of each read to the allele it best matches. This is exactly what all the custom fallback modes were doing in effect, but now it's implemented in one place instead of six or so. This lets us delete `UnfilledLikelihoods` and also lets `VariantAnnotator` apply any annotation. @ldgauthier Since the most non-trivial aspect is the new integration test I'm inclined to assign you the review, but a case could be made for someone on the engine team. This completely broke the `VariantAnnotator` tests, which were based on exact matches. This had been an issue before and has always been a bit of a nuisance, but now overhauling the tests became completely unavoidable. So, I rewrote all the tests and wrote a rigorous test based on concordance with annotations from `Mutect2`. If I were reviewing I would start with the new code in `VariantAnnotator` that constructs the likelihoods object from the reads and verify that it is just a more polished version of the fallback code that several annotations used to have. Then I would look at the new `VariantAnnotator` integration tests. Some of the tolerances are fairly liberal but it's worth noting that much of the old exact match ""truth"" annotations were completely bogus. This is better than what we had before by a long shot but it's still use at your own risk.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6172:1269,integrat,integration,1269,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6172,2,['integrat'],['integration']

At least I would like to have a different artifact for pure-java components separate from the rest, to be sure that python (for example) is not required. Does some of this makes sense for you? A proposed scheme will be the following:. * `common`/`engine`: this should include the engine, utils, and everything that it can be useful by itself. This should be a dependency for every other module. Components in other sub-modules might be proposed to be moved to this one if they might be useful out of their own. If the package names does not change, the interface and usage will be unmodified, and then there is no change in the API.; * `spark`: I think that this is a nice separation from other components. In this case, this can include all code related with Spark classes for removal of the huge Spark dependency in sub-projects that does not require them.; * `tools` and `spark-tools`: this can be even split in more fine grained sub-modules depending on the pipeline (e.g. CNV, Mutect, etc., if it makes sense). In addition, the separation between normal tools and spark-tools will make easier for downstream projects to support or not spark in their code.; * `experimental`: this might contain prototype code that might change in the future, and that will be nice in terms of documentation purposes (always annotated with `@BetaFeature` or `@Experimental`, etc.). In addition, code shouldn't rely on the code in this package for anything, allowing to have experimental code for play around and remove if required, without any major version bump.; * `testing`: this will contain the testing framework. It is related with #1481 and #3567. ; * `documentation`: this might be useful for code dependent on `com.sun.javadoc` to do not interact with other classes if code for documenting a downstream project is not necessary.; * Other modules might be useful for concrete components: e.g, ., the gCNV python computati",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3900:1462,pipeline,pipeline,1462,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3900,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Critically, do *NOT* install gcc on the VM. Installing gcc fixes this problem. #### Expected behavior; If you install gcc, that results in the installation of libgomp1, which allows the Intel library to load and use AVX acceleration. You could probably install libgomp1 on its own, but I did not test that.; > 14:51:01.013 INFO NativeLibraryLoader - Loading libgkl_utils.so from jar:file:/home/ubuntu/gatk-4.1.2.0/gatk-package-4.1.2.0-local.jar!/com/intel/gkl/native/libgkl_utils.so; > 14:51:01.015 INFO NativeLibraryLoader - Loading libgkl_pairhmm_omp.so from jar:file:/home/ubuntu/gatk-4.1.2.0/gatk-package-4.1.2.0-local.jar!/com/intel/gkl/native/libgkl_pairhmm_omp.so; > 14:51:01.053 INFO IntelPairHmm - Using CPU-supported AVX-512 instructions; > 14:51:01.053 INFO IntelPairHmm - Flush-to-zero (FTZ) is enabled when running PairHMM; > 14:51:01.054 INFO IntelPairHmm - Available threads: 16; > 14:51:01.054 INFO IntelPairHmm - Requested threads: 8; > 14:51:01.054 INFO PairHMM - Using the OpenMP multi-threaded AVX-accelerated native PairHMM implementation. #### Actual behavior; Without libgomp1, AVX acceleration doesn't work:; > 19:43:36.387 INFO NativeLibraryLoader - Loading libgkl_utils.so from jar:file:/home/ubuntu/gatk-4.1.2.0/gatk-package-4.1.2.0-local.jar!",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6012:1180,install,install,1180,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6012,1,['install'],['install']
Deployability,"e GATK/Picard (`IndexFeatureFile `), but they would print inconsistent logs with the rest of my toolkits and they aren't overridable because the classes are final; thus, I would use a decorator over this tools to print the proper startup messages. After a while, I might implement a `VariantWalker`, which will require that I implement another layer (`MyVariantWalker`). Thus, I end up with a lot of naive classes implemented on top of the base walkers and wrappers around bundled GATK/Picard tools. This is very difficult to maintain, because if a change is done at the `CommandLineProgram` abstract class for the logging output (a new method, for example), I will need to update every naive class and wrapper if I bump the GATK version. In addition, extensions of my own toolkit (if any) would need to do the same, making the class-dependency tree so deep that it is difficult to follow (with GATK3, this problem was really driving me crazy when I tried to implement custom tools). On the other hand, there is another use case for the GATK itself: once barclay has a common class for CLP, GATK would be able to run directly Picard tools without the decorator; nevertheless, they will still need it for the log output. This also gives me the impression that the configuration for the CLP output should be at the barclay level, to be shared between Picard/GATK/downstream toolkits to be able to combine them. I think that a way of managing that woul be a new field in the CLP consisting on an interface/abstract class, `CommandLineStartupFormatter`, with the same CLP methods for this kind of operations, that will be passed to the CLP on construction (in `Main`) and defaults to whatever base class is chosen. This will allow custom toolkits to override in their `Main` the formatter and thus make consistent the output of every tool. Another option is to use directly something like the Spring framework, but I think that it is quite complicated for API users without knowledge of Spring (like me).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4101#issuecomment-382994646:2071,configurat,configuration,2071,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4101#issuecomment-382994646,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"e a bad idea to have these incomplete jars floating out in the wild.; 3. Everyone develops on separate branches, and merges to master only when everything in a branch is ""release-ready"". In this scenario master itself is always (theoretically, at least) ready for release. This solves the original problem of release of some tools being blocked by others, but creates some other problems: last-minute merge conflicts across dev teams, large amounts of code being held back for months while it undergoes testing, harder to share code across groups, more complex git workflows for everyone.; 4. Everyone is free to merge development versions of tools to master (as is currently the case), and most of the time we try to release everything in the GATK together. On rare occasions when, eg., CNV needs a release now and HC is not ready, we create a branch off of the last tagged release, cherry-pick the CNV tools (or whatever) into it, and release that. Then when the HC stabilizes and master is once again releasable, we do the next release from master.

Once internal convergence is achieved, the converged posteriors must be saved to a workspace in order to be consumed by the continuous sub-model. The new internally converged posteriors will be admixed with the old internally converged posteriors from the previous epoch with the _external_ admixing rate. - Introduced two-stage inference for cohort denoising and calling. In the first (""warm-up"") stage, discrete variables are marginalized out, yielding an effective continuous-only model. The warm-up stage calculates continuous posteriors based on the marginalized model. Once convergence is achieved, continuous and discrete variables are decoupled for the second (""main"") stage. The second stage starts with a discrete calling step (crucial), using continuous posteriors from the warm-up stage as the starting point. The motivation behind the two-stage inference strategy is to avoid getting trapped in spurious local minima that are potentially introduced by mean-field decoupling of discrete and continuous RVs. Note that mean-field decoupling has a tendency to stabilize local minima, most of which will disappear or turn into saddle points once correlations are taken into account. While the marginalized model is free of such spurious local minima, it does not yield discrete posteriors in a tractable way; hence, the necessity of ultimately decoupling in the ""main"" stage. - Capped phred-scaled qualities to maximum values permitted by machine precision in order to avoid NaNs and overflows. - Took a first step toward tracking and logging parameters during inference, starting with the ELBO history. In the future, it may be desirable to allow tracking of arbitrary RVs and deterministics via command line args (for debugging and exploratory work).

Deployability,"eblocking step***. . It also seems as if we lose the PL field for these variants when working with reblocked gvcfs (which could explain why GenotypeGVCF isn’t giving us calls for these variants). I've heard that support for hom-refs with no PLs was implemented in CombineGVCFs as of Sept 2021, but I'm still seeing the issue with CombineGVCFs 4.3.0.0. To provide more info:. - We are seeing these issues regardless of if reblocked gvcfs are analyzed together with or separate from non-reblocked gvcfs. (For reference, the downstream steps in our pipeline are GenomicsDBImport & GenotypeGVCFs, but we’re seeing the same results with CombineGVCFs & GenotypeGVCFs on a smaller set of test gvcfs.); - I have a test set of samples that I've run with and without ReblockGVCF, and have used CombineGVCFs 4.3.0.0 & GenotypeGVCFs 4.3.0.0, and we're still seeing this issue.; - I have rerun ReblockGVCF including the `--allow-missing-home-ref-data` and `--all-site-pls` flags, but neither of these seem to solve the issue either. . #### Steps to reproduce. Run WARP's [ExomeGermlineSingleSample 3.1.7](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/releases/tag/ExomeGermlineSingleSample_v3.1.7) pipeline. With the relocked gvcfs, run CombineGVCFs, then GenotypeGVCFs. ; Running WARP's [ExomeGermlineSingleSample 3.1.7](https://github.com/broadinstitute/warp/releases/tag/ExomeGermlineSingleSample_v3.1.7) pipeline ***but skipping the reblocking step*** and running CombineGVCFs and GenotypeGVCFs results in these same variants being called as hom-ref (which makes me think that reblocking is messing these up somehow). . Note that so far, I've only tested on our own samples. If this is something you can't reproduce, I could potentially rerun on publicly available samples to demonstrate the issue. Let me know if this is needed. . #### Expected behavior; A large number of variants should be called as hom ref (`0/0`). #### Actual behavior; Many of these variants are left as not called / missing genotypes (`./.`).",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8208:2054,release,releases,2054,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8208,4,"['pipeline', 'release']","['pipeline', 'releases']"
Deployability,"ed and the underlying backend has been updated again, from Aesara to PyTensor.; > 10. So if we are going to update the environment to support Python 3.10+, it probably makes sense to go all the way to PyMC 5.9. I've made some strides in this PR; as of [6b08f3a](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8561/commits/6b08f3af205cb9af1f5c63a0786f9a5a52cd78c1), I've made enough updates to accommodate API changes so that cohort-mode inference for both GermlineCNVCaller and DetermineGermlineContigPloidy runs successfully under Python 3.10 and PyMC 5.9.0---although note that 5.9.1 has been released in the interim!. However, our work has just begun. Results now produced in the numerical tests mentioned above are quite far off from the original expected results. It remains to be seen whether this is due to the randomness of inference, some slight changes to the model prior that were necessitated by the API changes, or some bugs introduced in other code updates. (Also note that I believe Andrey's PR in item 4 already broke these tests, although the numerical differences were much smaller and more reasonable---but perhaps he can confirm. Also noting here that I think determinism is still currently broken as of this commit---there have been some changes to PyTensor/PyMC seeding so that our previous theano/PyMC3 hack no longer applies.). So I think the next step is to just go to scientific-level testing and see what the fallout is. Ideally, we'd still get good performance (or perhaps better! at least on the runtime side, hopefully...) and we can just update the numerical tests.

Deployability,"ed for a variant in terms of alignment overlap are different for taking part of PL calculation and AD/DP calculation. . Where is not totally clear what is the best way to go in practice. It seems to me that we should be consistent here and both PL and AD/DP should use the same criterion. The offending code lines:. **HaplotypeCallerGenotypingEngine.java ln171**:. ```java; ReadLikelihoods<Allele> readAlleleLikelihoods = readLikelihoods.marginalize(alleleMapper, ; new SimpleInterval(mergedVC).expandWithinContig(ALLELE_EXTENSION, header.getSequenceDictionary()));; if (configuration.isSampleContaminationPresent()) {; readAlleleLikelihoods.contaminationDownsampling(configuration.getSampleContamination());; }. ```; The code above decides the involvement in PL calculations. Notice that ```ALLELE_EXTENSION``` is set to ```2```. . For the AD/DP and so on the code responsible is in **AssemblyBasedCallerGenotypingEngine.java ln366**:. ```; // Otherwise (else part) we need to do it again.; if (configuration.useFilteredReadMapForAnnotations || !configuration.isSampleContaminationPresent()) {; readAlleleLikelihoodsForAnnotations = readAlleleLikelihoodsForGenotyping;; readAlleleLikelihoodsForAnnotations.filterToOnlyOverlappingReads(loc);; } else {; readAlleleLikelihoodsForAnnotations = readHaplotypeLikelihoods.marginalize(alleleMapper, loc);; if (emitReferenceConfidence) {; readAlleleLikelihoodsForAnnotations.addNonReferenceAllele(Allele.NON_REF_ALLELE);; }; }. ```. The ```filterToOnlyOverlappingReads(loc)``` is called then the overlap criterion is strict. (e.g. 0bp padding). This is also the case for the ```marginalize``` call if the conditional is false as the loc passed has not been padded. It seems to me that setting the ```ALLELE_EXTENSION == 2``` is a very deliberative action (so it was done for a reason) and perhaps this is the way to go... but in deed if the read really does not overlap the variant should be considered at all. .

Deployability,"elease but other tools are not. ---. @vdauwera commented on [Thu Apr 28 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215498517). Frankly on the face of it I hate the idea of toolset-specific jars, because it increases entropy on the distribution & support side of things. I would much prefer to see this resolved by project development branches. With the possibility of making project-specific nightly builds off of those branches, to enable pointing people to hot fixes for a specific toolset without taking in whatever else is going on in other projects. ---. @droazen commented on [Fri Apr 29 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215757315). Alright, to give an overview of where this stands, we have several options on the table for solving this problem:; 1. Split the GATK into even more repos (a CNV-only repo, a HaplotypeCaller repo) that are versioned separately. GATK release X would then consist of CNV version Y, HaplotypeCaller version Z, gatk-public version P, etc. This is probably the most ""correct"" solution from a software engineering perspective, but might be a nightmare to work with.; 2. Have the ability to release jars with a subset of the tools exposed to the user (eg., CNV-only jars). Geraldine hates this one, and it does seem like a bad idea to have these incomplete jars floating out in the wild.; 3. Everyone develops on separate branches, and merges to master only when everything in a branch is ""release-ready"". In this scenario master itself is always (theoretically, at least) ready for release. This solves the original problem of release of some tools being blocked by others, but creates some other problems: last-minute merge conflicts across dev teams, large amounts of code being held back for months while it undergoes testing, harder to share code across groups, more complex git workflows for everyone.; 4. Everyone is free to merge development versions of tools to master (as is cur",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2851:3195,release,release,3195,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2851,1,['release'],['release']

The user mentioned that this didn't happen on GATK 4.1, so I've been comparing both versions of the code. It turns out that the implementation of ""GenotypingEngine.java"" has changed since then, and after some digging, I noticed that the issue is that the newer versions have uninitialized instances of the class ""OneShotLogger"". The fix is simple, I've added the change myself and built GATK again. The user reports that the issue is gone. Just add the following code inside the constructor method:. ``` ; protected GenotypingEngine(final Config configuration,; final SampleList samples,; final boolean doAlleleSpecificCalcs) {; this.configuration = Utils.nonNull(configuration, ""the configuration cannot be null"");; Utils.validate(!samples.asListOfSamples().isEmpty(), ""the sample list cannot be null or empty"");; this.samples = samples;; this.doAlleleSpecificCalcs = doAlleleSpecificCalcs;; logger = LogManager.getLogger(getClass());; this.oneShotLogger = new OneShotLogger(logger); // <------ ADD THIS LINE; numberOfGenomes = this.samples.numberOfSamples() * configuration.genotypeArgs.samplePloidy;; alleleFrequencyCalculator = AlleleFrequencyCalculator.makeCalculator(configuration.genotypeArgs);; }; ```. #### Steps to reproduce; See description, but I can't provide the exact inputs used for it. #### Expected behavior; The null pointer exception shouldn't occur, there should be a warning only. #### Actual behavior; Program crashes with null pointer exception for high enough values of ploidy.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8158:3686,configurat,configuration,3686,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8158,6,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"endencies to the conda environment in a branch and rebased on that. A few issues that I've run into or that came up in discussion with @jamesemery and @cmnbroad:. -I moved all tests that depend on R into the `python` test group (which should perhaps be renamed to `conda`). Note that some of these also fall into the `spark` test group---not sure if there is any special Spark setup done for that group, but we should make sure that they don't fail if they're not run with the conda environment. -@cmnbroad mentioned that some Picard tools that depend on R may break outside of the conda environment if the user does not have the R dependencies. -When we install R in the base image, we pull in a lot of basic dependencies (e.g., build-essential, various libraries and compilers, etc.) So when the R install is removed, it looks like many tests begin failing or hanging, perhaps because they are falling back on Java implementations (e.g., AVX PairHMM tests). We need to determine the dependencies for these tests and install them separately. Here is the list of packages that get pulled in by the R install: ```autoconf automake autotools-dev binutils bsdmainutils build-essential; bzip2-doc cdbs cpp cpp-5 debhelper dh-strip-nondeterminism dh-translations; dpkg-dev fakeroot g++ g++-5 gcc gcc-5 gettext gettext-base gfortran; gfortran-5 groff-base ifupdown intltool intltool-debian iproute2; isc-dhcp-client isc-dhcp-common libalgorithm-diff-perl; libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl libalgorithm-merge-perl libarchive-zip-perl; libasan2 libasprintf-dev libasprintf0v5 libatm1 libatomic1; libauthen-sasl-perl libblas-common libblas-dev libblas3 libbz2-dev; libc-dev-bin libc6-dev libcc1-0 libcilkrts5 libcroco3 libcurl3; libdns-export162 libdpkg-perl libencode-locale-perl libfakeroot; libfile-basedir-perl libfile-desktopentry-perl libfile-fcntllock-perl; libfile-listing-perl libfile-mimeinfo-perl libfile-stripnondeterminism-perl; libfont-afm-perl libfontenc1 libgcc-5-dev libgdbm3 libgettextpo-dev; libget",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5026#issuecomment-406373954:1111,install,install,1111,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5026#issuecomment-406373954,1,['install'],['install']

The offending code lines:. **HaplotypeCallerGenotypingEngine.java ln171**:. ```java; ReadLikelihoods<Allele> readAlleleLikelihoods = readLikelihoods.marginalize(alleleMapper, ; new SimpleInterval(mergedVC).expandWithinContig(ALLELE_EXTENSION, header.getSequenceDictionary()));; if (configuration.isSampleContaminationPresent()) {; readAlleleLikelihoods.contaminationDownsampling(configuration.getSampleContamination());; }. ```; The code above decides the involvement in PL calculations. Notice that ```ALLELE_EXTENSION``` is set to ```2```. . For the AD/DP and so on the code responsible is in **AssemblyBasedCallerGenotypingEngine.java ln366**:. ```; // Otherwise (else part) we need to do it again.; if (configuration.useFilteredReadMapForAnnotations || !configuration.isSampleContaminationPresent()) {; readAlleleLikelihoodsForAnnotations = readAlleleLikelihoodsForGenotyping;; readAlleleLikelihoodsForAnnotations.filterToOnlyOverlappingReads(loc);; } else {; readAlleleLikelihoodsForAnnotations = readHaplotypeLikelihoods.marginalize(alleleMapper, loc);; if (emitReferenceConfidence) {; readAlleleLikelihoodsForAnnotations.addNonReferenceAllele(Allele.NON_REF_ALLELE);; }; }. ```. The ```filterToOnlyOverlappingReads(loc)``` is called then the overlap criterion is strict. (e.g. 0bp padding). This is also the case for the ```marginalize``` call if the conditional is false as the loc passed has not been padded. It seems to me that setting the ```ALLELE_EXTENSION == 2``` is a very deliberative action (so it was done for a reason) and perhaps this is the way to go... but in deed if the read really does not overlap the variant should be considered at all. . This come from a more complex discussion whether the in cases whether variants ar",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5434:1431,configurat,configuration,1431,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5434,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"entUtils`). There are still some improvements that can be made (especially in segment union and the subsequent modeling), but we should be ready to go for a first validation. Some notes:. WDL:; - I've moved the old pipeline to `somatic_old` folders.; - There is now just a matched-pair workflow and a panel workflow. We can add a single BAM case workflow or expand the matched-pair workflow to handle this, depending on the discussion at https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/3657.; - WES/WGS is toggled by providing an optional target-file input.; - For all workflows, we always collect integer read counts; for WGS, these are output as both HDF5 and TSV and the HDF5 is used for subsequent input.; - For the case workflow, we always collect allelic counts at all sites and output as TSV.; - [x] We should output all data files as HDF5 by default and as TSV optionally. EDIT: This is done for `CollectFragmentCounts`.; - [x] We will need to update the workflows when @MartonKN and @asmirnov239 get `PreprocessIntervals` and `CollectReadCounts` merged, respectively. These tools will remove the awkwardness required by `PadTargets` and `CalculateTargetCoverage`/`SparkGenomeReadCounts`. Denoising:; - All parameters are exposed in the PoN creation tool (#3356).; - Without a PoN, standardization and optional GC correction are performed (#3570).; - Other than the minor point about sample mean/median being used inconsistently noted above, the denoising process is essentially exactly the same mathematically as before (""superficial"" differences include the vastly improved memory and I/O optimizations, the ability to adjust number of principal components used, the removal of redundant SVDs, the enforcement of consistent GC-bias correction).; - [ ] That said, I'll carry over this TODO from above: Revisit standardization procedure by checking with simulated data. We should make sure that the centering of the data does not rescale the true copy ratio.; - The only major difference is we ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-333202828:1159,update,update,1159,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-333202828,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"enty of coverage and no obvious reason for such a low GQ score. Often the GQ should be 99 as the DP >40. This seems to be primarily an issue with homozygous reference calls. . The GT is accurate for the high DP sites but the inaccurate GQ is problematic for any genotype level qc on the pVCF. If the site is recoded from 0/0 to './.' for GQ <20, the result is higher missing rate due to the inaccurate GQ=0. . Directly calling the VCF with HaplotypeCaller without the gVCF intermediate gVCF file calculates the correct GQ score. Freebayes also calculates a correct GQ on these samples.; [rs429358_gq_dp.pdf](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/files/2612419/rs429358_gq_dp.pdf). #### Steps to reproduce. I am seeing this bug for 57 samples of 5000 crams at snp rs429358 but I would expect it is not unique to this site. . Select two crams with a Passed site with:; cram 1. Call with GT='0/0, GQ=0 and DP >40.; cram 2. Call with GT='0/1' or '1/1' and DP>20. . Create vcf with two approaches:. Pipeline 1.

Good GQ scores were also estimated with Freebayes on these samples also. Pipeline 2 HaplotypeCaller --> bvcf--->ImportVCF-->GenotypeVCF-->VCF with 2 samples. gatk HaplotypeCaller -R /restricted/projectnb/casa/ref/GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla.fa\; -I $sample.cram\; --use-new-qual-calculator\; -L chr19:44907684-44909822\; -ERC GVCF\; -O bad.g.vcf.gz. Followed by import and GenotypeVCF. . #### Expected behavior; Pipeline 2 should generate accurate GQ scores that match the GQ in the HaplotypeCaller vcf output of pipeline 1. Instead GQ=0. . This is the output for the 57 GQ=0 samples with pipeline 1 which is accurate.

Deployability,"environment for gCNV. Even taking out TensorFlow (assuming that the CNN will not be supported by this environment), it's a difficult task:; > 1. The goal is to update Python from 3.6 to 3.10+, since Terra now requires the latter for officially supported images.; > 2. However, gCNV relies on the PyMC3 package. PyMC3 3.1 is currently used in GATK master. 3.1 was released in 2017, not long before our release of gCNV in 2018, but it's very old now.; > 3. The latest version of Python that is supported by PyMC3 3.1 in conda is Python 3.6.; > 4. @asmirnov239 has a draft PR (#8094) that updates PyMC3 to 3.5 and Python to 3.7, which clearly still falls short of Python 3.10+. This PR also updated some gCNV code to make it compatible with PyMC3 3.5. (It also removed TensorFlow and added PyTorch.); > 5. @asmirnov239 also merged a PR that added tests for numerical reproducibility of GermlineCNVCaller in cohort mode in #7889.; > 6. The earliest version of PyMC that supports Python 3.10+ is PyMC 4, released in 2022.; > 7. However, PyMC 4 introduces API changes, which will also require additional gCNV code changes and numerical testing.; > 8. These API changes are because the underlying computational backend for PyMC was updated from Theano (think of this as an old alternative to TensorFlow) to Aesara.; > 9. Since then, PyMC 5.9 has been released and the underlying backend has been updated again, from Aesara to PyTensor.; > 10. So if we are going to update the environment to support Python 3.10+, it probably makes sense to go all the way to PyMC 5.9. I've made some strides in this PR; as of [6b08f3a](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8561/commits/6b08f3af205cb9af1f5c63a0786f9a5a52cd78c1), I've made enough updates to accommodate API changes so that cohort-mode inference for both GermlineCNVCaller and DetermineGermlineContigPloidy runs successfully under Python 3.10 and PyMC 5.9.0---although note that 5.9.1 has been released in the interim!.

As a start, you can see the results of some optimizations I did on the CHM mix on slide 15 at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zGuquAZWSUQ-wNxp8D6HhGNjIaFcV0_X9WAS4LODbEo/edit?usp=sharing Here, I optimized over haplotype-to-reference + read-to-haplotype SW parameters on various metrics after variant normalization using vcfeval. These optimizations were done using the Bayesian optimization framework I prototyped long ago (see https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-evaluation/tree/master/pipeline-optimizer and https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t5WOAEOMp0xAzJgpKbP68BUnclNYfIVRrDSL9wl1-3A/edit?usp=sharing); this entailed running parameter scans using a local Cromwell on my desktop. Probably this optimization work could be redone relatively easily using the Neptune framework put together by @dalessioluca, which was still in development at the time I did this work. Happy to share the resources and scripts I used if we go down this route; they are pretty lightweight. See more discussion starting here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5564#issuecomment-710107566. Alternatively, we could merge this branch to expose the parameters now and punt on consolidating/optimizing them. I'm not completely convinced we should even do the former unless we are going to follow through on the latter, but happy to defer to others. Finally, note also there is one code optimization that I removed, since it makes assumptions on the SW parameter values that might not be va",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6885#issuecomment-891907471:1974,pipeline,pipeline-optimizer,1974,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6885#issuecomment-891907471,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline-optimizer']

To allocate more memory for the Funcotate task, one has to define this **small_task_mem** variable at the workflow level. This effectively changes the amount of memory for all tasks that make use of this dictionary, rather than just the Funcotate task. Funcotate has two input variables **default_ram_mb** and **default_disk_space_gb** which have no bearing on the memory and disk space configuration for the task.; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45641912/139334343-8e614e17-27ef-4fef-815d-fe6e8c39ffef.png). This leads to user confusion when they see these variables in the method configuration page, put values in, and don't see their Funcotate task use the specified values.; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45641912/139334535-4b9a0353-910e-4764-a6d2-a454f4d344aa.png). #### Steps to reproduce; Define the input variables **default_ram_mb** and **default_disk_space_gb** for a run of the Mutect2 workflow to be different from the amounts defined by [*small_task_mem*](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/4.1.8.1/scripts/mutect2_wdl/mutect2.wdl#L140) and [**disk_space**](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/4.1.8.1/scripts/mutect2_wdl/mutect2.wdl#L407). #### Expected behavior; Defining the input variables **default_ram_mb** and **default_disk_space_gb** allows you to specify your preferred memory and disk space configuration for the Funcotate task. #### Actual behavior; These variables do not define the runtime configuration for the task. Memory is defined by a workflow-level input that isn't clearly connected to Funcotate. #### Suggestion; Utilize the variables **default_ram_mb** and **default_disk_space_gb** that already exist in the task in such a way that modifying them has an impact on the configuration of the task VM.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7532:2501,configurat,configuration,2501,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7532,3,['configurat'],['configuration']

In general, I think all of the standardization (i.e., filtering/imputation/truncation/transformation) steps could stand some revisiting. Evaluation:. - [ ] Revisit standardization procedure by checking with simulated data. We should make sure that the centering of the data does not rescale the true copy ratio.; - [x] <s>Investigate the effect of keeping duplicates. I am still not sure why we do this, and it may have a more drastic impact on WGS data.</s> Turns out we don't keep duplicates for WGS; see #3367.; - [ ] Check that GC-bias-correction+PCA and PCA-only perform comparably, even at small bin sizes (~300bp). From what I've seen, this is true for larger bin sizes (~3kbp), so explicit GC-bias correction may not be necessary. (That is, even at these (purportedly) large bin sizes, the effect of the read-based GC-bias correction is obvious for those samples where it is important. However, the end result is not very different from PCA-only denoising with no GC-bias correction performed.); - [x] <s>Check that changing CBS alpha parameter sufficiently reduces hypersegmentation.</s> <s>Looks like the hybrid p-value calculation in DNACopy is not accurate enough to handle WGS-size data. (Also, it's relatively slow, taking ~30 minutes on ~10M intervals.) Even if I set alpha to 0, I still get a ridiculous number of segments! So I think it's finally time to scrap CBS. I'll look into other R segmentation packages that might give us a quick drop-in solution, but we may want to roll our own simple algorithm (which we will scrap anyway once the coverage model is in for somatic).</s> I've implemented a fast kernel-segmentation method that seems very promising, see below.; - [ ] Investigate performance vs. CGA ReCapSeg pipeline on THCA samples.; - [ ] Investigate concordance with Genome STRiP.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-316894351:5840,pipeline,pipeline,5840,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2858#issuecomment-316894351,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Deployability,"ervals; reorganized copynumber packages.; -For motivation of changes in CallCopyRatioSegments, see #3825.; -I added the ability to turn off binning in PreprocessIntervals by specifying bin_length = 0.; -I removed the separation between coverage and allelic packages to make the package structure a bit simpler.; -@MartonKN should review, since he wrote PreprocessIntervals and is updating the caller. Added segmentation classes and tests for ModelSegments CNV pipeline.; -I added implementations of copy-ratio, allele-fraction, and ""multidimensional"" (joint) segmentation. All implementations are pretty boilerplate; they simply partition by contig and then call out to KernelSegmenter. Note that there is some logic in multidimensional segmentation that only uses the first het in each copy-ratio interval and if any are available, and imputes the alt-allele fraction to 0.5 if not.; -Makes sense for @mbabadi to review this, since he reviewed the KernelSegmenter PR. Added modeling classes and tests for ModelSegments CNV pipeline.; -Most of this code is copied from the old MCMC code. However, I've done some overall code cleanup and refactoring, especially to remove some overextraction of methods in the allele-fraction likelihoods (see #2860). I also added downsampling and scaling of likelihoods to cut down on runtime. Tests have been simplified and rewritten to use simulated data.; -@LeeTL1220 do you think you could take a look?. Added ModelSegments CLI.; -Mostly control flow to handle optional inputs and validation, but there is some ugly and not well documented code that essentially does the GetHetCoverage step. We'll refactor later, I filed #3915.; -@asmirnov239 can review. This is lower priority than the gCNV VCF writing. Deleted gCNV WDL and Cromwell tests.; -Trivial to review. Added WDL and Cromwell tests for ModelSegments CNV pipeline.; -This includes the cost optimizations from @meganshand and @jsotobroad (sorry guys, I wasn't sure how to track your contributions while fi",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3913:1106,pipeline,pipeline,1106,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/3913,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Jointcall.vcf of proband, and mother. redbox refers to maternal variant information. . . Except for chromosomes X, Y, and MT, these issues did not occur. In addition, I suspected the false positive variants filtering which is the advantage of GATK jointcall. however, the variants which have ""."" values do not seem to be false positive variants considering AD, DP, and variant allele frequency (VAF). #### Steps to reproduce; GATK version used: 3.8.1; ``",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8129:1283,release,release,1283,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8129,1,['release'],['release']
Deployability,"f the CNV tools to be blocked for a long time because something else in the toolkit (like the `HaplotypeCaller`) is not ready for release. . There could be a `properties` file in the jar that controls which tools are exposed via the command-line -- this way we could publish a jar that exposes only the CNV tools, for example. An alternative approach would be to use branching and cherry-picking to do this kind of selective release, or split the GATK into even more repositories, but I'm not sure those approaches would be preferable. ---. @droazen commented on [Thu Apr 28 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215491991). This came out of a discussion between myself and @LeeTL1220 . ---. @lbergelson commented on [Thu Apr 28 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215493945). So a gatk release would contain different sets of tools sometimes? Wouldn't that be confusing? It seems like it would be better to always release different jars, or version sets of tools independently and release jars with the latest good release of each individual set of tools. ---. @droazen commented on [Thu Apr 28 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215494432). @lbergelson Well, we definitely still want there to be releases of the GATK toolkit in its entirety. If the CNV tools need to be released more frequently than this, they could be versioned/released separately and periodically incorporated into the toolkit-wide releases. ---. @droazen commented on [Thu Apr 28 2016](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-protected/issues/473#issuecomment-215495326). To be clear, though, this is very much still in the ""throwing out ideas for discussion"" phase, and alternate proposals are welcome provided they include the concept of a GATK-wide release, and make some provision for the situation where the CNV tools (or some other sub-category) are ready for release but other tools are not. -",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2851:1146,release,release,1146,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2851,4,['release'],['release']

The sooner we can develop a strategy to leverage these in Java land, the better!. I'd expect that roughly the same amount of code would be needed to specify this model using Stan. Interfaces for Stan exist for many other languages, so it might be relatively easy to come up with some Java bindings. However, one downside is that Stan is not built on top of a computational graph (e.g., theano/tensorflow), so we don't get GPU/distributed computing for free.

It should be said that I consider this a major blocker for the CNV team. I don't think it makes sense to rebuild the somatic pipeline to include the new coverage model until we move to this ADVI framework or something like it. I do think @mbabadi should continue adding features (such as common CNV calling) to his non-ADVI germline implementation, so that we can be in a position to start calling on gnomAD or other large cohorts, but that we should eventually move the germline tool over to this framework as well.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2984:4137,pipeline,pipeline,4137,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2984,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

One could imagine that smoothing could be disabled (so that all samples retain the common segmentation after modeling) or made more aggressive (so that private events don't get inadvertently introduced into other samples due to noise, perhaps), depending on the use case. It looks like the joint segmentation allows some additional events to be resolved, although I haven't done any rigorous evaluations. We could probably cook up some evaluations using simulated toy data or in silico mixtures, but there's really no reason why this shouldn't work decently well, especially if the kernel-segmentation method works well on a single sample for your data. It would also be interesting to understand at which point changing segmentation parameters on a single sample can no longer yield the same performance as joint segmentation on a fixed number of samples; however, this is probably a function of various S/N ratios, and it might not be easy to characterize this behavior outside of toy data. The segmentation parameter space is big enough to make this unwieldy even for toy data, too. Perhaps we can get some feedback from test users---not only on performance, but also on the structure of the new workflow. It might also be worth gauging whether a new WDL is warranted. Otherwise, we just need to add some unit tests for correctness of the multisample-segmentation backend class, integration tests for plumbing of the new tool, and perhaps address some of the issues mentioned above.

EDITEDIT: Now using gs://broad-gotc-test-storage/joint_genotyping/exome/scientific/truth/master/gather_vcfs_high_memory/small_callset_low_threshold.vcf.gz provided by @ldgauthier, which does have AS annotations.; ; We'll use expected outputs here as inputs to downstream steps, but rather than provide the expected outputs directly, we'll create copies of them and provide those as inputs. This will make the tests better encapsulated. However, it should be relatively easy to update the whole chain of test files, should one choose to do so. EDIT: Let's just provide the expected outputs directly. So it'll be even easier to update the whole chain---just set the flags for all three tools to overwrite the expected results.; ; We test the Cartesian product of the following options: 1) non-allele-specific vs. allele-specific, 2) SNP vs. indel vs. both, and 3) positive vs. positive-unlabeled. Downstream, we'll further subset to a subset of these options, since training/scoring functionality shouldn't really change across some of them.; ; I'm currently just using call outs to system commands to diff and h5diff the VCFs and HDF5s, respectively. I think the latter command should be available in the GATK Conda environment. This will be a bit awkward, in the sense that the tests for this tool will require the Conda environment, but the tool itself will not. But I think this is probably preferable to writing test code to compare HDF5s, minimal though that might be, since the schema might change in the future.; - [x] Tool-level docs.

Deployability,"gments` optionally takes denoised copy ratio and/or allelic counts, `PlotModeledSegments` outputs only the corresponding plots appropriately.; - I added a dependency on the R package `data.table` to slightly speed up the reading of input files.; - Setting `pch="".""` also sped up the generation of scatter plots.; - Plotting now takes a couple of minutes, most of which is I/O (#3554).; - AAF (rather than MAF) is now plotted for allele fraction (#2957). Other:; - I've introduced a `LocatableCollection` class to unify how allelic counts, copy ratios, and segments are stored and read/written from/to TSV (#2836). Intervals are always output in lexicographical order for now, to be consistent with the old coverage collection (#2951). Once @asmirnov239's `CollectReadCounts` is in, we can change everything over to ordering determined by the sequence dictionary.; - Column headers and log2 copy ratio output have been standardized throughout (#2886).; - [x] I've also introduced a `NamedSampleFile` abstract class to tag files that have `#SAMPLE_NAME=...` as the first comment line. For `CollectAllelicCounts`, this simply uses code borrowed from `GetSampleName`. We should unify the reading and storing of sample names at some point (#2910).; - [x] We will need to replace `SimpleReadCountCollection` (which currently serves as the interface between the old coverage collection files and the new code) with one of these subclasses when `CollectReadCounts` is in. We can also change `NamedSampleFile` depending on what he's implemented.; - [x] We should eventually write proper SAM headers with useful tags to all TSV and HDF5 files generated by our tools that represent annotated intervals that can be associated with a single sample. Documentation:; - [x] I need to update class javadoc and example invocations throughout. The initial PR will already be quite massive, so I'll leave this until later.
