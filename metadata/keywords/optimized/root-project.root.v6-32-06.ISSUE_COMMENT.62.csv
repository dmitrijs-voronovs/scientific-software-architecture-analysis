I explicitly specified that `Initialize` and `InitTask` can be no-op in the doc because those two ""feel"" like they should be doing something important, given their name. I thought users would know what they want to put in `Exec` and `Finalize`, but they might be confused by `Initialize` and `InitTask`. I can reword it if you think it's unclear. The only method that doesn't have to be present is `PartialResult`. The others are required, at least for now. In the future we could add some logic to `TActionImpl<T>` that implements `Initialize`, `InitTask`, `Exec` and `Finalize` as no-op if they are not implemented in `T`.

In my recent updates, I addressed bullet points 1, 2, and 3. 1. Was trivial to address; 2.

Testability,"Hi @ferdymercury,. at least for the first point (rebuilding without any change), you should try using Ninja via `cmake -G Ninja`. Makefiles are known inefficient to detect that no work has to be done - the `Built target [...]` lines don't actually do anything, it's the point where the build system detects that the target has already been built. With Ninja, a ""build"" takes only a split of a second if there's nothing to be done (even though I'd argue that's not really the important benchmark for a build system). For the second point, I think `core/base/src/TROOT.cxx` is so fundamental that it needs to rebuild `root.exe` and `rootcling` which in turn triggers rebuilding of a whole bunch of other things.

We are running large number of fits (~1000s) and see large increase in memory throughout I suspect comes from RooFit, I already see ~20% smaller memory increase if I set the ownership of the nll but since we use lot of RooFit objects it would be lot of work to trace all the objects and test if they cause this (I could just set ownership of each roofit objects in the code but that is also not ideal ...).

Testability,"Hi @guitargeek thanks for your comment. > Can you change the test such that it's fast? It looks like you are only fitting a Poisson, it should not be slow right?. I think this might be due to the fact that this test invokes the multiprocessing framework, which may very well induce some overhead especially for smaller tasks. I also notice that on my local pc this test is not slow (around 10 seconds for all of the tests, and around 2 seconds for this particular test) so perhaps the build/test machines are not tailored for multiprocessing jobs?. Anyway, as @egpbos also mentioned, this test should probably also only be ran if multiprocessing is enabled, as it would fail otherwise.

On one hand, I don't know why flags about how the test statistic is evaluated need to be stored. On the other hand, the `_batchEvaluations` flag that is currently in `RooNLLVar` and that this PR moves to `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` [is not excluded from the IO](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooNLLVar.h#L82). I guess you had a good reason for this choice, so I kept the new flags in `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` also for the IO. You think this is the right choice?.

Testability,"Hi @hageboeck, thanks a lot for the quick fix! About your naming problem:. > I'm not happy with the naming. The folder is `core/test_support`, the library `ROOT::ROOTTestSupport`, but the namespace and the header are historically named `ROOTUnitTestSupport`. Which one?. This would be my reasoning:; 0) Assuming that no user uses the test support library, only us in `root-project` repos so we can do namespace changes ; 1) Looking at the the other libraries in `core`, the folder names are all concatenated without any delimiter (`rootcling_stage` is the only exception).; 2) Historical names are not important anymore (at least for the git history) because the files are move anyway.; 3) If you propose to name the library `ROOT::ROOTTestSupport`, is `ROOT` not redundant?. So I would go for folder `core/testsupport`, both library and namespace `ROOT::TestSupport`, and the header file moves from `ROOTUnitTestSupport.h` to `inc/ROOT/TestSupport.hxx`.

I've now synchronized the changes to https://github.com/root-project/llvm-project/releases/tag/ROOT-llvm16-20240116-01, moving the header to `clang/include/clang/Basic` as mentioned yesterday to keep the ability to build against a vanilla version of LLVM). @vgvassilev I put the commit only into `ROOT-llvm16`, not `cling-llvm16` because I think it's not that relevant for Cling standalone.

Testability,"Hi @lmoneta ,. Thank you for the help. I've looked at the other examples in tutorials/math and I gather the idea is just to produce a short stand alone script that shows how to use the function?

For the test I apologise but I'm not too sure how to do this. I tried to see if there was a test already done for the nonrelativistic BreitWigner case that is already in ROOT I could compare to to try to understand what I need to do for this, but there does not seem to be. . If in the math/mathcore/test directory I do `grep -R -i ""breit"" . ` , there are some results but they all seem to be testing the distribution version of the breitwigner in ProbFuncMathCore rather than the version defined in TMath. Would you be able to point me to an example of how to produce a test for this? (ideally an example that was done with the non relativistic version of the breit wigner that is already implemented if this test exists and I've just missed it, since the test for the relativistic version should be almost identical).

So the hope was that writing `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH=${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/lib` in the builtin_xrootd cmake invokation would correctly point the `LC_RPATH` of the libraries in the `build/lib` folder to `build/lib` while the ROOT configuration for installation would overwrite that variable to `install/lib` in the event that a user actually calls the installation command, which is not what happens in the nodes.

Testability,"Hi @vgvassilev, `cling/test/StratupFile.C` is added. However it only covers usage of `.cling_profile.C`. To proceed further, I would like to clerify the above decisions first. Let me summarize again here:. 1. Should we .x execute the startup file(s) or execute it in shebang `#!` way?; @eguiraud, @vgvassilev, @Axel-Naumann, what is the designed/documented difference between the 2?; Will it effect project root (which I have not tried out myself. I am experimenting standalone cling only); As far as I read from the web, `rootlogon.C` and `.rootrc` are executed in shebang way.; Their filename-functions `rootlogon()`, `rootrc()` are not executed. My proposal: Execute startup files in .x way . 2. How should the startup files be named? `.cling_profile`, `.cling_login`, `.cling_logon` like bash and root?. https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html. Should we adopt file suffix `.C` ?. My proposal: `.cling_profile.C` to align with rootlogon.C (to be honest I just want the editor syntax highlighting...). 3. Do we need `.cling_profile` and `.clingrc` as the original draft implementation?; If inside the script we can tell if cling is in interactive mode by a macro like `CLING_INTERACTIVE` then; only 1 file is needed. My proposal: keep `.cling_profile.C` as the only startup file. Forget about `#define CLING_INTERACTIVE 1` for now.

Testability,"Hi Enrico, thank you very much for taking a look. > 1. I guess the behavior of TTaskGroup should mimic what TThreadExecutor does, e.g. it should use the task arena if it exists, and it should construct one if it doesn't. What's the rationale for doing things independently of ROOT's task arena? Does this mean users might see more cores used than they expect in some cases?. I believe this change only removes an unnecessary restriction on when `TTaskGroup` can be used (i.e. after looking through the implementation, I don't think having IMT globally enabled is a precondition for the use of `TTaskGroup` and test benchmarks using this implementation seem to perform the same). > 2. Are you ok with silently do nothing if R__IMT is undefined? Would it be better to print a warning?. Thank you, yes, a warning would probably be better. > 3. Can we also have a way to disable RNTuple's multi-threading even if implicit MT is enabled, like TTree has?. Yes, this makes sense to me. It will probably need a big warning in the docs about when to call it and/or some graceful shutdown logic. Even if this PR doesn't make it that method might be valuable by itself. > the rationale behind my question is that we should not have N different multi-threading behaviors for N components.

Testability,"Hi John,. > The merge conflict was just because Pere intervened to correct a fix I had made (just a formatting > issue) but he did it directly in the main repository and in a way that left my ‘origin’ out of sync. . Yes and the way it was resolved (presumedly by the web interface) is sub-optimal. The history of master looks like:; ```; * 203703f - (71 minutes ago) coverity 61577: fix resource leak delete [] c — John Harvey; * e815eaa - (2 hours ago) coverity 61279: fix copy/paste error — John Harvey; * ed09395 - (6 days ago) resolving merge conflicts — John Harvey; |\ ; | * 6c63896 - (6 days ago) Fix for failing test (too strict tolerances for floating point values) — Guilherme Amadio; | * 9d6ac44 - (7 days ago) Data members used as array size must be static. — Philippe Canal; | * 27d58ca - (7 days ago) - Allows any number of options - Small mods in the online help - Spell check — Olivier Couet; ....; | * | | | | 7db5e8c - (8 weeks ago) Coverity 94053: fixed uninitialised class members — John Harvey; ....; * | | | | | 96fa411 - (20 hours ago) Downgrade to C++11 — Philippe Canal (origin/master, origin/HEAD); ....; * | a18c480 - (8 weeks ago) Coverity 94053: fixed uninitialised class members — John Harvey; ```.

Testability,"Hi Marcin,. That worked and did some progress in understanding the problem. A potential work-around would be requested the dictionary for the 2 level of namespace/struct that contains the typedef (in the same dictionary). In order to test any solution to the problem I still need a standalone reproducer and I am still having some difficulties. In particular in my attempts to reproduce the dictionary generation the typedef does not appear in the dictionary nor in the rootmap file. Weirder even, when I follow the [instructions](https://atlassoftwaredocs.web.cern.ch/guides/build_release/) to build Athena from scratch (on zeus.lbl.gov; done a couple of weeks ago), I get a different rootmap file (however because the build is currently (for other reason) partially broken I did not try with it):; ```; grep jetlink_t ../atlas_working/build/build/Athena/_CPack_Packages/Linux/RPM/Athena_23.0.17_x86_64-centos7-gcc11-opt/usr/Athena/23.0.17/InstallArea/x86_64-centos7-gcc11-opt/lib/Athena.rootmap; ```; vs; ```; grep jetlink_t /cvmfs/atlas-nightlies.cern.ch/repo/sw/master_Athena_x86_64-centos7-gcc11-opt/2023-03-05T2101/Athena/23.0.20/InstallArea/x86_64-centos7-gcc11-opt/lib/Athena.rootmap; typedef MissingETBase::Types::jetlink_t; ```.

Testability,"Hi Patrick, thanks a lot for these excellent developments! I will start the Jenkins tests to see if the CI can build it. To successfully integrate these developments, we should split the changes up into smaller PRs, as discussed in the RooFit weekly meeting. We could, for example, chunk it like this:. 1. First PR with changes to `math` only (`mathcore` and `minuit2`). Please ensure that no commit in this PR doesn't touch both math packages at the same time if not necessary. As far as I understood, the changes to `mathcore` and `minuit2` factorize, and you can make a commit for `mathcore` and then one or more for `minuit2`.; 2. Second PR with the new `roofit` packages `multiprocess` and `roofitZMQ`, again with separate commits for the individual packages. I guess you'd have to exclude the multiprocessing test that depends on roofit at that point, though. In this PR, we can also discuss in more detail how to manage the zero MQ dependency.; 3. Third PR with the rest, integrating the new `multiprocess` and `roofit/ZMQ` packages into RooFit. Feel free to split it up further if you think that's better. Some general things to consider in the new PRs:. * It seems unfeasible to rewrite the commit history in this PR to something that factorizes as proposed above. I guess you need to create new commits from the diff that only affect single packages.; * Please avoid mixing code formatting changes with actual changes in the same commit.; * Even better, avoid code formatting changes altogether. We want to eventually use a well-defined clang-format style (specified in [this file](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/.clang-format)), so changing the formatting in your PRs to something that is not compliant with the clang-format style is not meaningful.; * If your developments introduce new files (in particular the new `roofit` packages), please apply the ROOT clang-format style, so we don't have to touch these files again later just for the sake of reformatting.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8294#issuecomment-854587983:84,test,tests,84,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8294#issuecomment-854587983,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"Hi Rod,. :confused: So, how did you compile that code exactly? Just `g++ main.cxx`, right?. In that case XRootD would be picked up from `/usr`. Which doesn't tell us much about our problem. Since RD's test job will pick up XRootD from:. ```; /cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/sw/software/21.2/AnalysisBaseExternals/21.2.139/InstallArea/x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt/lib/; ```. This is why I said at the beginning, that I'm suspicious about the `LD_PRELOAD` setting. If that library wants to use XRootD, but it was compiled against a different version of XRootD than what the analysis release comes with, then we're in trouble. Note that **all** ATLAS releases come with their own version of XRootD, not just the analysis releases. So any grid node setup that wants to force one particular version of XRootD on the job, will give us a really bad time...

Testability,"Hi Vicenzo,. I agree building your own python is perhaps somewhat uncommon (and it is especially nonsensical to do it on Fedora, which has up to date distribution packages for both ROOT and python). I was testing an environment intended for clusters where users would not have admin privileges but may generally benefit from improvements in newer python than included, and cppyy must be built with the python you're using for it to work. . I don't think the assertions were necessarily meant to be enabled here, and disabling them does ""fix"" this issue (as the assertion isn't checked), but I think that's potentially somewhat besides the point. While it's very rare to run a python that has assertions enabled, presumably the assertions are there for a reason, even if they're not checked in release builds. The failing invariant could be harmless, or it may be causing subtly wrong behavior in the GC that could cause seemingly random problems down the road in a more complicated script. On the other hand, it also looks like things change again in python 3.12...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13694#issuecomment-1739495970:205,test,testing,205,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13694#issuecomment-1739495970,5,"['assert', 'test']","['assertion', 'assertions', 'testing']"
Testability,"Hi Vincenzo,. So one thing I didn't mention is that in this case, we were also building Python 3.11, and it seems that the key is that it was being built with assertions enabled, unlike the default Fedora 38 python3 build. Whether or not the python3 assertion failing corresponds to a real problem, I can't say... . It seems that it's possible to reproduce the issue without building anything by using the F38-packaged `root` and `python3-debug`, and then running my reproducer with `python3-debug` (which has assertions enabled) rather than python3. . ```; $ cat test.py ; import ROOT. f= ROOT.TFile(""test.root"",""RECREATE""); $ python3 test.py # succeeds; $ python3-debug test.py #fails; python3-debug: /builddir/build/BUILD/Python-3.11.5/Objects/typeobject.c:1210: subtype_traverse: Assertion `type->tp_dictoffset' failed.; *** Break *** abort ; ....; ```.

Testability,"Hi Xavier,. I would very much like to be able to use ROOT together with the latest oneAPI beta, if at all possible. Since oneAPI comes (amongst many other things) with TBB, if I want to use ROOT reliably in that environment, it should really use oneAPI's TBB version. (In the past this worked quite well for my tests.). Wanting to hide the public TBB dependency from your interfaces is a good goal. But I would not do it with a forward declaration. Even in case the class would not be hidden behind version specific namespaces. If you do need to use the TBB class in the interface of the class, then tough luck. Then the class can just not hide its dependence on TBB, and that's the end of it. You could however try to design the class such that it would not have to directly reference the `tbb::task_arena` type at all in its interface. Then you could cleanly hide the include of this type into the source file. Long story short: TBB is changing its interface, as we've been warned for a while. If ROOT wants to be able to use multiple versions of TBB at the same time, it must stop relying on explicit names like `tbb::interface7::task_arena`...

Testability,"Hi all! To assess the situation, I tried to build ROOT with CUDNN 9.0 myself, and it is actually a *huge* interface change!. I wouldn't recommend to anyone to do this migration without the help of CI tests, which we don't have for anything CUDA-related. Just for reference, the previous migration to CUDNN 8.0 wasn't done by a core ROOT developer but indeed generously by the Arch package maintainer @kgizdov in 2020:; https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6058; Of the 3350 lines of code in `tmva/tmva/src/DNN/Architectures/Cudnn`, a significant fraction had to be changed. Therefore, we need to have a discussion: should `cudnn` even be enabled in any build of ROOT?. I have a few more data points, besides the observation that it's only packagers that seem to care about `cudnn=ON`:; * All questions about ""cudnn"" on the forum are about build problems, not actual usage: https://root-forum.cern.ch/search?q=cudnn; * On indico, it also doesn't seem like it's used much: https://indico.cern.ch/search/?q=cudnn&sort=mostrecent; * There is only one presentation about this work (a [summer student talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/833883/contributions/3494481/attachments/1897066/3136480/SFT_Talk.pdf)). For 3350 lines of code in ROOT where we don't know if they are used, the support burden is very high. IMHO, you, @andresailer and @lahwaacz should consider going for `cudnn=OFF`, and we should only continue to invest in this ROOT component once an actual user complains about its absence either here on GitHub or on the forum. @lmoneta and @dpiparo, what is your opinion?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15413#issuecomment-2123646791:200,test,tests,200,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15413#issuecomment-2123646791,1,['test'],['tests']

The main difference of our current 'minitree production' jobs this round is that we included a build of the MCFM physics generator with the build of our analysis code and we use it while running to calculate physics matrix elements for each event. . So to test this, I rebuilt our analysis code without building MCFM, and of course no longer calculate the matrix elements. I submitted this to the BNL site, and we read the files fine:. H4lAnalRun2 INFO processEvents: try to open file: root://dcgftp.usatlas.bnl.gov:1096//pnfs/usatlas.bnl.gov/BNLT0D1/rucio/mc16_13TeV/84/1f/DAOD_HIGG2D1.23315636._000001.pool.root.1; H4lAnalRun2 INFO processEvents: called TFile Open ; H4lAnalRun2 INFO processEvents - opened file 0 root://dcgftp.usatlas.bnl.gov:1096//pnfs/usatlas.bnl.gov/BNLT0D1/rucio/mc16_13TeV/84/1f/DAOD_HIGG2D1.23315636._000001.pool.root.1; H4lAnalRun2 INFO notifyNewFile: Entering. which as you may remember is the TFile::Open on a file which would use xrootd access. The job continues fine, reading 6 files, as one would expect. Now there is no matrix element calculated before we start reading the events. So it must be that somehow linking in the MCFM libraries causes problems for calling the gethostname. I must admit that I have no idea how/why this would 'interfere', since MCFM is not run at all before the TFile::Open. . So I think that we can let this bug report rest for now. If anyone might have ideas on how to check or fix the MCFM problem, suggestions are welcome. But I no longer think that xrootd has a problem. This is clearly a problem in how we have set up our client code.

Testability,"Hi! The `RooTrace` cannot be used like that, because it doesn't track all the constructors and destructors of RooAbsCollection. If you want to use it, you have to change the code in the classes you want to trace. Alternatively, you can measure memory consumption with `ProcInfo`, similar to https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7933:; ```C++; #include ""RooRealVar.h""; #include ""RooGaussian.h""; #include ""RooPlot.h""; #include ""RooTrace.h"". void test() {. RooTrace::active(kTRUE);; RooTrace::mark();; RooRealVar x(""x"",""x"",-10,10);; RooDataSet d(""d"",""d"",RooArgSet(x));; RooRealVar s(""s"",""s"",1,1,10);; RooRealVar m(""m"",""m"",0,-10,10);; RooGaussian g(""gauss"",""gauss(x,m,s)"",x,m,s);; RooPlot *f=x.frame();. for (Int_t j=0; j<300; ++j){; x.setVal(gRandom->Gaus(0,1));; d.add(x);; }. ProcInfo_t pinfo; . for (Int_t i=0; i<1000; i++) {. g.fitTo(d,RooFit::PrintLevel(-1));//,RooFit::SumW2Error(true),RooFit::BatchMode(true));. gSystem->GetProcInfo(&pinfo);; std::cout << i << "" memory usage "" << pinfo.fMemResident << "" "" << pinfo.fMemVirtual << std::endl;; }; }; ```. Now, I don't see any memory increase per fit iteration. The only thing that happens is that the memory consuption climbs very very slowly when you do tens of thousands of fits because of the MemPoolForRooSets (also reported in https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7933). But with the recent changes to the MemPoolForRooSets, this increasing memory consumption is strongly reduced and not relevant in your example. I will close this issue because it relies on a wrong report based on `RooTrace`, but it you have any more memory issues please feel free to open another thread or reopen this one!.

Testability,"Hi, . Thank you Hans for your example, it was very useful for this case. . I have investigate this and I think the assert should be removed and there is no need of a warning or an error. The first time one iterates the first states comes from MnSeed and I think in that case the state is always valid (but not 100% sure); Eventually we could add the assert or (better) an Error but not at line 232, but at line 75, when we enter in the top function VariableMetricBuilder::Minimum. What we should maybe change is the logic around line 150. A covariance matrix is computed via MnHesse. This is done to check the edm. If the edm is still too large the minimization is continued. ; However, if Hesse fails, (for example in the test above f(x) = -x, because the second-derivatives is zero) there is no real point in continuing the minimization. The correct edm will not make sense and one should stop iterating. ; Maybe we could add a Warning there before line 146, like; ```; if (!st.IsValid()) { ; print.Warn(""Invalid Hessian - exit the minimization"");; break; ; }; ```.

Finally, i found that it happens because of this new function: ""TPgSQLStatement::SetSQLParamType"".; The function doesn't take into account all possible cases that have been accounted for before, e.g. if in 'SetBinary(Int_t npar, void* mem, Long_t size, Long_t maxsize)' the 'size' variable is greater than 'maxsize'. In the example the 'SetSQLParamType' function creates buffer with size being equal only 'maxsize', which is less than 'size' of the input array.; The old error-prone implementation worked at all my tests :).

Testability,"Hi, thanks for your comments! I tested the code now with a modified `rooArgusModel` example from https://root.cern/manual/roofit/. What I changed:; * Number of generated toy events increased from 2000 to 200000; * Changed fitting command to `model.fitTo(*data, RooFit::Offset(true), RooFit::Extended(false));`. The offset has to be enabled to cover the changes suggested in this PR. The extended term has to be disabled for the same reason that the offset subtraction has been changed in this PR: the extra term is of the similar order of magnitude as the Kahan sum over events but is summed with the Kahan algorithm. Therefore, the carry is lost and becomes zero. But if the carry is zero, we can't see what's different in the offset subtraction with this PR. In the first three iterations, I printed the result and carry before and after offset subtraction (without this PR):; ```; Without PR. 1. Step:; before offset subtraction : -500453.65447450732 carry -1.2374989921681845e-11 ; ater offset subtraction : 0 carry 0. 2.

Now with the PR I print 3 lines: ; 1) before offset subtraction; 2) after subtracting the offset sum from the result and the offset carry from the result carry; 3) after the dummy addition of `0.0`. ```; After PR. 1.

Testability,"Hi,. Thanks for trying to recreate it! I tried on my end as well, trying to recreate the code snippet the best I can in a standalone .cxx file. Unfortunately, I also couldn't obtain this ""Invalid write of size 1"" either. I have tried with the exact same pathways, same ROOT version, and same compiler. I copied quite a bit of code over to this standalone file from the project. My best guess is that it's a transient problem, and could be a side-effect of memory issues elsewhere in the code. My setup on lxplus while attempting to reproduce the problem; ```; > lsetup ""root 6.28.08-x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt""; > source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/contrib/gcc/13.1.0/x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt/setup.sh; > gcc --version; gcc (GCC) 13.1.0; > root -b -q; Welcome to ROOT 6.28/08; > g++ -o <output> <standalone_file>.cxx `root-config --cflags --glibs`; ```. My setup using setupATLAS when compiling the project ; (And tested with the standalone file as well); ```; setupATLAS; asetup AnalysisBase,24.2.27; ```. **Regarding the debug build**; I used the latest corresponding to `x86_64-el9-gcc13-dbg`; ```; source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/dev3/latest/x86_64-el9-gcc13-dbg/setup.sh; ```. However, this gives a ROOT version of ROOT 6.31/01, which is higher than what I compiled for (6.28/08). With this upgraded ROOT version, my project no longer compiles. (And since we don't plan on updating past the AnalysisBase release, I don't plan to fix the compilation error 🙂); If there's a way of obtaining a debug build of ROOT 6.28/08, I can try it. This coredump only started appearing when our compiler version changed from x86_64-centos7-gcc8-opt to x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt, and we moved to AnalysisBase,24.2.27 from AnalysisBase,22.2.113.

Testability,"Hi,. thanks for this huge PR: you really put forward quite some solid work about several tests - thanks. For what platform (os, compiler, architecture) were you exactly fixing them? We run them on the platforms listed here: http://cdash.cern.ch/index.php?project=ROOT. My comments, file by file, starting from the ones which might need some discussion before being incorporated in the master. The ones labelled with OK, all but 5, listed at at the end, are for me ready to go in.; - math/mathmore/test/testSpecFunc.cxx: we do not see this failure on 64 and 32 bits platforms. On what architecture/compiler did the test fail?; - math/mathmore/test/testSpecFunc.cxx: Nice update for coding conventions. My changes were aiming to fix 32 bits builds. Is this the case for you too?; - test/stressGraphics.ref: I think this is something to be commented by @couet ; - test/stressMathCore.cxx: This was not failing for us. The question asked above about the failing platform still holds.; - test/stressTMVA.cxx: I am not sure I get the advantage of trying 2 paths and then falling back on the file on the web: was this a problem for you?

Testability,"Hi,; I double-checked the behavior of `TTree::Draw` and `TTreeReader` when reading ""misaligned"" friends in a number of situations: as `TTrees`/`TChains`, friends longer/shorter than the main tree, friends with/without a `TTreeIndex`. With the path at https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/7131, which avoids an infinite loop with `TTreeReader` + indexed friend tree, `TTreeReader` and `TTree::Draw` behave the same in all cases except the one reported here. This means e.g. that switching from using a `TTree` to using a `TChain` to read the same data can change the number of entries `TTreeReader` reads in case of a friend that's larger than the main `TTree`. The problematic logic is that of `TTree::LoadTree(entry)`, which does not return an error if `entry` is larger than the number of entries in the main tree as long as the friend tree has enough entries (again note that `TChain` behaves differently, ending the event loop as soon as the main tree entries are over, and `TTree/TChain::Draw` also behaves like that). In particular, these lines are what causes `TTree::LoadTree` to not return an error:. https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/8d616f45e399d3a918b6a78edf98aa54219eb5d2/tree/tree/src/TTree.cxx#L6447-L6452. <hr>. Now, should `TTree::LoadTree` behave differently, or should `TTreeReader::SetEntryBase` not rely (just) on the return value of `LoadTree` to decide whether the event loop is over?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6518#issuecomment-773505129:682,log,logic,682,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/6518#issuecomment-773505129,1,['log'],['logic']

I understood valgrind would give that, but apparently; nothing useful.; The whole thing is running under python, using exec, so maybe this throws; valgrind. For example, there are multiple 'Command' where I expected just 1; for the RD binary, e.g. ==2554== Command: /usr/bin/awk. The grid site could have user/FS/network peculiarities, but it runs in an; identical container everywhere, so there should be no differences in lib; versions. Cheers,; Rod.

I am in no position to actually review the content of the pull request, but it seems you are adding two commits with unclear descriptions that change 37 files and 4000+ lines -- making it a hard PR to review. If you have time and it sounds reasonable to you, it might be desirable to split the PR in commits containing small self-contained logical changes (with a descriptive commit message).

Like this is not needed to be a class, can be simple function in a namespace. The advantage of having as a class is that one can cache some information as class data members. . Then test of the Vavilov is also a good example, however it is better to use the google test framework, resulting in a much simpler test to write. You need just to use the macro defined by test to compare the function value with the reference one. ; You have many examples in ROOT for gtest, for example in `hist/hist/test` directory like `test_TH1.cxx` or `test_TFormula.cxx`, `test_TF123_Moments.cxx`.

Testability,"I agree that it is an unfortunate circumstance to have the test not passing. However, I still urge you to consider the effect on debugability removing strict tests will have. I have wasted a lot of time trying to track down a subtle bug due to loose tests which left me unable to determine where the bug came from. Conversely, setting tests strictly and tracing discrepancies, I found a different bug in the Kahan sum: #11940. Unit tests especially should be as strict as possible. In absence of unit tests (which unfortunately is the case for the parts of RooFit I worked on), strict ""integration"" tests like these are the closest I could get. Note also that it was simply part of my original assignment: to ensure users can trust the new parallelized methods, I built them to be bit-wise exactly equal to the old methods. So, I know from experience how tedious it is to trace down these bit-wise differences to their actual concrete source, but also think that because we are dealing with scientific software, precision, robustness, reliability and interpretability (of components and hence the whole) are important. Of course, performance is an important factor too, but it's just one of the aspects. We want the end-results of experiments to be accurate and explainable, right? I personally at least don't like when I have to sell a ""because of floating point errors"", because I've been bitten by them a few times now. Now, I'm also well aware that the project only has a given amount of resources and I myself am currently more or less out of resources (I can spend only my free time), so my vote probably doesn't count strongly :) If I could be of more practical help in this, I would definitely be happy to, but I also don't have a non-x86 machine, so it's not feasible for me to do much right now.

However, IMHO https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13815#issuecomment-1759250811 clearly shows that the underlying problem is much bigger and older than just the failing test with LLVM 16.

However I quickly got stuck because just removing `o->Print();` on the first loaded object leads to many errors of the form `Error parsing payload code for class Inner` that I can't make sense of...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13815#issuecomment-1768325139:305,test,test,305,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13815#issuecomment-1768325139,3,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,I also found the culprit of the new CI failures. It's the Python [tblib](https://github.com/ionelmc/python-tblib) package (a dependency of Dask) that specifically treats the serialization/deserialization of exceptions. A new release appeared on Oct 22th and that somehow forces the serialization of the `std::runtime_error` thrown in the RDataFrame event loop. Downgrading to the previous tblib version makes the problem disappear on the alma9 CI image that I'm testing with.

Testability,"I am looking for a hotfix for the upcoming llvm release.

Testability,"I discovered 2 memory hoarding issues (which were seen from code paths that were not scaling as expected with the number of dlopen/dlclose cycles). However, the underlying problem is still present but is due glic itself. As seen in https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=tree;f=stdlib;h=b5a85b12ee3a72ea2a6df2be8bea9d0eba38eeb5;hb=refs/heads/release/2.28/master in the files `cxa_atexit.c` and `cxa_finalize.c. When a library is loaded, the atexit functions (including global object destructors) are added to a global linked list `__exit_funcs` (see [cxa_atexit](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blame;f=stdlib/cxa_atexit.c;h=6d65f7e615bd8e9b0bcdb4655945d7ddfc514f2b;hb=refs/heads/release/2.28/master) ). In `cxa_finalize.c` that list is looped over (see line [34+](https://sourceware.org/git?p=glibc.git;a=blame;f=stdlib/cxa_finalize.c;hb=c41041bc2f84eb8f44ff36c3d14e55944185e665#l34)). However, the `__exit_funcs` is never cleaned up (and apparently element are not reused at least in our case). The number of iterations in that loop increased with the number of dlopen/dlclose cycles square. (Indeed the output of callgrind (with `--dump-inst=yes`) confirms that this (and even worse the inner loop) exactly as `(N*(N-1)/2) N=number of dlopen/dlclose`. So the best we can do is to adjust the test length to fit within the timeout (the length is to increase the chances of multi-thread clash).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12863#issuecomment-1561881205:1307,test,test,1307,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12863#issuecomment-1561881205,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"I don't think so? I was proposing to retrieve the verbosity level once, before the RDF event loop, and then only call `R__DEBUG_HERE` if the verbosity level requires it (and the check on the cached verbosity level would not lock, so in the common case you'd have no locking). This is at the cost of ignoring changes in the verbosity level that occur during the event loop, of course. I'm open to better solutions :smile:. But I don't think it's reasonable, as a pattern, to unconditionally take locks every time we _might_ want to log something, it would mean that RDF cannot ever put a `R__DEBUG_HERE` or `R__INFO_HERE` in event loop code. `if (gDebug > 0) Info(...)` does not have that issue.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6875#issuecomment-734279781:531,log,log,531,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6875#issuecomment-734279781,1,['log'],['log']

I concede that the potential for undefined behavior is limited. A user handling two TList* at once, one to GetListOfTasks() and one to something else, and adding a TCanvas* to the former by mistake is not a terribly likely thing to happen. (I just am generally not a fan of static or C-style casts -- which are the casts mostly used in my collaboration. 95% of the time, the object is of the type you expected and nothing bad happens. But in the rare case it is not, I prefer an assert (or even a null pointer dereference) to just reinterpreting the object as a different type and seeing where that takes the code.).

Testability,"I generally expect libraries to be silent and applications to write log files.

If that's the goal here—for RooFit to be a library that other libraries or applications are built upon—then it shouldn't print its banner on startup. Although RooFit's API was designed with data analysts in mind (i.e. as an application), in recent years it has de-facto become a library with the likes of HistFactory, Combine, and lots of mini-frameworks built on top of it.

Testability,"I have extended the Vc GenVector test as requested to include a speed test. The test asserts that, for an equal number of 'photons' the processing time for the vectorised test should be a factor of `Vc::double_v::Size` faster than the scalar test (to within 10% to account for fluctuating machine conditions etc.). Output looks like. ```; Scalar best time = 0.00278807; Vectorised Vc best time = 0.00138211; Vectorised Vc SIMD size = 2; Vectorised Vc speedup = 2.01725; ```.

Testability,"I have modified the initial commit to include the `IgnoreSignal` call in `TXXSystem::Abort` before throwing the signal, in order to avoid the infinite recursion cases. Regarding the two doubts:. > Should it print a stack trace? (This may or may not be useful for an assert). In the end I have not moved the return after `StackTrace`, so with this solution we don't print the stack trace for an unexpected `SIGABRT`. In the case of an assert, the assert failure itself is still notified with a message that tells you the file and line where it happened, so perhaps we don't need a stack trace. > When on the prompt, should it recover or stop the process? (probably stop the process but then again we don't stop the process for other 'bad' state: SigBus, SigSegmentationViolation, SigIllegalInstruction, SigFloatingException). The current solution stops the process. If a `SIGABRT` was thrown it's because a critical (unrecoverable) error happened, so it makes sense to stop.

[EDIT] Never mind, I think it's fine like that, as the important part is, I believe:; ```. if (!(type&kIncremental)) {; // In case of incremental build, we will call Write on the top directory/file, so we do not need; // to call SaveSelf explicilty.; target->SaveSelf(kTRUE);; }; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/15059#issuecomment-2022265350:24,test,test,24,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/15059#issuecomment-2022265350,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"I made some investigations about the possible counter initialization for every translation unit, and I found [this stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19366615/static-member-variable-in-class-template) where someone explains:; >Therefore, a class template will always have external linkage and so are its static data members (const or not). So, Foo<int>::x will always refer to the same entity in memory regardless of which translation units this expression appears in. The linker makes this happen. Of course, this had to be tested before I could believe it. For my test I have three files. First, a source to build an executable that will call two functions where the implementations end up in different translation units:; ```C++; // main.cc; void callOne();; void callTwo();. int main() {; callOne();; callTwo();; return 0;; }; ```; Then, a library that uses a class with a UniqueID as suggested in this PR:; ```C++; // mylib.cc; #ifndef FUNC_NAME; #error ""FUNC_NAME needs to be defined""; #endif. #include ""UniqueId.h"". #include <iostream>. struct MyClass {; UniqueId<MyClass> const& uniqueId() const { return _uniqueId; }; const UniqueId<MyClass> _uniqueId;; };. void FUNC_NAME() {; auto idCounterAddr = &UniqueId<MyClass>::counter;; auto idVal = static_cast<int>(MyClass{}.uniqueId().value());; std::cout << idCounterAddr << "" "" << idVal << std::endl;; }; ```; The point of setting the function name via preprocessor flag is that we can easily compile two identical implementations in two translation units.; Finally, a the test script to compile all the translation units, link them together and run the executable:; ```bash; #!/bin/bash. # test.sh. g++ -DFUNC_NAME=callOne -c mylib.cc -o one.o; g++ -DFUNC_NAME=callTwo -c mylib.cc -o two.o; g++ -c main.cc; g++ -o main main.o one.o two.o. ./main. rm *.o main; ```; The test outputs:; ```; 0x560e77c0f198 1; 0x560e77c0f198 2; ```; So indeed, the linker makes sure that the static counter member of the `UniqueId` class wil",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8324#issuecomment-857743352:548,test,tested,548,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8324#issuecomment-857743352,2,['test'],"['test', 'tested']"
Testability,"I managed to get it to work on HTCondor/lxbatch thanks to the instructions [here](https://batchdocs.web.cern.ch/specialpayload/dask.html). The distributed RDF case (with the `wait_for_workers` call) works fine provided the cluster is configured as:; ```python; import socket ; cluster = HTCondorCluster(cores=1, processes=1, memory=""1GB"", disk=""0.1GB"",; job_extra={; ""+JobFlavour"": '""espresso""',; 'should_transfer_files': 'Yes',; 'when_to_transfer_output': 'ON_EXIT',; 'getenv': 'True'; },; death_timeout = '60', ; scheduler_options={; 'port': 8786,; 'host': socket.gethostname(); },; extra=['--worker-port 10000:10100']; ); ```. Note that for the dask-only example I had to use futures instead of `delayed`, and submit explicitly to the cluster (and this works both with and without the `wait` call, as expected):; ```python; x = client.submit(inc, 1); y = client.submit(inc, 2); z = client.submit(add, x, y); print(f""Result is: {z.result()}""); ```; The dask documentation is not very enlightening about the use of `delayed` with clusters... As for using the `SLURMCluster`, just adding the call to `wait_for_workers` worked fine with the config I had before :+1:.

Testability,I now have a standalone reproducer. The main feature I was missing is that the target of the type is an instance of a class template with a default parameter; consequently it does not have a forward declaration provide as part of the dictionary. It is likely that moving to dictionary using the new 'c++ module' features (where dictionary don't need to have any forward declaration) would work around the issue. I am moving forward to test solution to the original issue.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12378#issuecomment-1467047464:435,test,test,435,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12378#issuecomment-1467047464,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"I pushed an updated version, addressing the recent discussions. The first commit is from https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16391 and changes compared to the original PR version are separate commits to ease review - I plan to eventually squash them before merging. > I think we should test suppressed columns with staged clusters. Done, and it was indeed broken... > I wonder if it wouldn't be better, after all, to make staged clusters part of the normal code path. We would then have `CommitCluster()` being a shorthand for `StageCluster(); CommitStagedClusters();`. As discussed, it would mean that in the code you have to use a different API of you want to use staging. But perhaps that's not such a big deal. After all, even now you have to add extra code to commit the staged clusters. Partially done:; * I propose to rename `RNTupleFillContext::CommitCluster()` to `FlushCluster()`. This conveys the user intent, but gives flexibility to the implementation. `CommitStagedClusters()` can always be called.; * The new sink methods are `StageCluster()` and `CommitStagedClusters()`, for which `CommitCluster()` is a shorthand. The exception is `RPageSinkBuf` where we should still implement it directly because we can do so more efficiently. It is also needed to guarantee sequential files, which might not be the case with two separate critical sections. I also added a tutorial, here is an example output:; ```; === Writing with staged cluster committing ===; Thread #0 wrote events #0 - #24999 as entries #0 - #24999; Thread #1 wrote events #25000 - #49999 as entries #25000 - #49999; Thread #2 wrote events #50000 - #74999 as entries #50000 - #74999; Thread #3 wrote events #75000 - #99999 as entries #75000 - #99999. === ... with sequencing in blocks of 10000 events ===; Thread #0 wrote events #0 - #9999 as entries #0 - #9999; Thread #2 wrote events #50000 - #59999 as entries #10000 - #19999; Thread #3 wrote events #75000 - #84999 as entries #20000 - #29999; Thread #1 wrote events",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16343#issuecomment-2340232828:292,test,test,292,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16343#issuecomment-2340232828,1,['test'],['test']

The first separate folder (Version 2) method was from a discussion with @lmoneta, and the merged folder method (Version 3) was from a request by @amadio.

Testability,"I successfully ran @zzxuanyuan's version but got benchmarks far from mine, so I got suspicious if I'm seing effects of something else that changed in ROOT (or possibly me having changed the compile options with which I compile ROOT).

Testability,"I tested offline @hahnjo 's proposal, as it would have had the nice advantage of avoiding the backwards-incompatible change brought by the current status of this PR. A summary of the insights I gathered:. 1. There are some technical obstacles, the main one being that we don't have a single, coherent code path for all data sources. Crucially, `TTree` is handled differently from any other data format (i.e. it doesn't use the `RDataSource` mechanism). This practically means that I cannot create a lazy `RDataSource` to handle them all. But in first approximation this could have been solved with one extra branching; 2. It is not straightforward to know where exactly to trigger the inferring of the data source. Practically, this is needed at the very latest in `RLoopManager::Run`, i.e. right before the start of the event loop. But it can also be needed before that, namely whenever a node of the computation graph is created it might need to know about the column names it uses, so the dataset schema must be gathered thus the data source type must be inferred. Admittedly, this is also another fixable problem with a better documentation or cleaner code to explain exactly at what point of any RDataFrame application the loop manager would need the dataset schema in place; 3. Probably the greatest obstacle posed by this idea is that it indeed fixes one backwards-incompatible change, but introduces another one. RDataFrame allows some operations to run without triggering the computation graph, actually without even needing to populate the computation graph at all. Specifically, `Describe` produces a string description of some metadata of the dataset wrapped by the RDataFrame, e.g. the name of the TTree and the file it is stored in. This info doesn't need file opening (at least with `TChain`). The lazy data source would effectively change the behaviour of `Describe` as it would hide the type of the data source even if in principle it could be known (supposing the same workflow with ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13090#issuecomment-1889018672:2,test,tested,2,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13090#issuecomment-1889018672,1,['test'],['tested']

If we want something more detailed, like ""this dataframe will run its computations on a dataset named XXX, stored in a container of type YYY placed at ZZZ"", then we're looking for more. For a ttree without friends, this would translate to. * XXX = name of the tree; * YYY = ROOT file / TFile; * ZZZ = path to the ROOT file. And for a csv table it would be; * XXX = None; * YYY = CSV file; * ZZZ = path to the csv file. If the dataset is horizontally extended through e.g. friends, then the information above is not sufficient to identify the full dataset RDataFrame will run its computations on. For a ttree, we would also need to print out XXX,YYY,ZZZ for any friend of the tree.

Testability,"I think there is one thing that is clear:. * T*System::Abort should disable the signal handling before calling ::abort [rather than the caller of gSystem->Abort doing so]. What is not as clear is what should be the behavior for unexpected (which include failure of a 'regular' assert macro):. * Should it print a stack trace? (This may or may not be useful for an assert).; * When on the prompt, should it recover or stop the process? (probably stop the process but then again we don't stop the process for other 'bad' state: SigBus, SigSegmentationViolation, SigIllegalInstruction, SigFloatingException). Note: to print stack and still always abort, we just need to move the return introduce by the PR to after the call to StackTrack and before the call to HandleException/Exit.

Testability,"I'm afraid the ""book everything first, use results later"" is the price to pay to run everything in a single event loop: we need to know what to run before we run it, and at the same time we have to run the event loop to produce the result if you do things with it. However, by the time you lose track of where things were defined because your analysis is too complex, you probably should restructure your code so that you don't keep everything in a single function. Analyses that produce hundreds or thousands of histograms typically have some bookkeeping logic, they don't keep all results at main scope. Some of the more complex RDF tutorials show some possible ways to do it, e.g. in Python we keep `RResultPtr<TH1D>`s in a dictionary. There are other possible designs, like e.g. continuations on futures, but I don't think they increase readability/clarity in general.

I'll take a look but I don't have time to go too deep into the rabbit hole at the moment. @bellenot does this PR substitute #4947 or it complements it?. EDIT: plus, of course, the main question which we are discussing on the PPP channel on mattermost: is `EnableImplicitMT` always expected to be called before constructing `TTreeProcessorMT`? If yes, then these changes are not required if I understand correctly and #4947 is more in the right direction. EDIT2: seems like at least on some linux platforms the problematic tests are not run. there are only 6 gtests run for TTreeProcessorMT (e.g. [here](https://epsft-jenkins.cern.ch/view/ROOT/job/root-nightly-master/LABEL=ROOT-ubuntu18.10,SPEC=default,V=master/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/projectroot.tree.treeplayer/test/gtest_tree_treeplayer_test_treeprocessormt/)), while there are 8 in the corresponding file. plus -- I get a floating point exception if I run that test on my machine. So it might not be a windows-only problem. EDIT3: `clustersInThisFileSize` is zero because in the relevant tests we use empty `TTree`s. @stwunsch is that on purpose?

Testability,"If I merge the master (without the last two commits) into this test-fixes branch and then check the differences with your branch, only the test/TFormulaParsingTests.h file differs. I think the change made in master to that file attempted to fix some of the same test failures I attempted to fix, but not all of them. An fpEqual function was introduced to do comparisons between numbers, but unless the 3rd optional argument is given, that function only does normal operator== between the numbers. And only in one of the calls does it actually set this option. In my version I used a similar approach, but I used TMath::AreEqualAbs instead of writing a new function. I chose this function for consistency since it was already used by a few of the tests in the file. I added calls to TMath::AreEqualAbs to 6 places in the file, not only 1 - though one of the six is the same as the one place where the third option to fpEqual is used. Whether to use the existing TMath::AreEqualAbs or write a new similar function is of course a matter of taste, but since at present in master the third argument to fpEqual is only used at one single place the implementation in master is incomplete and some of the tests will fail in some architectures.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/155#issuecomment-231976502:63,test,test-fixes,63,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/155#issuecomment-231976502,5,['test'],"['test', 'test-fixes', 'tests']"

I think the failing test is just a matter of too strict assumptions, should be easily fixable by relaxing that. Btw, if you have suggestions there of how to construct a better test, I'm all ears. What the failing test does is: 1. assign task priorities, 2. run the tasks and record the order in which they are executed, 3. check the received order against the suggested one via the priorities. The problem is that due to random OS process scheduling delays, the received order is never 100% predictable. The only thing that is guaranteed is that if it has multiple tasks in the queue at one time that it will execute the one with highest priority first. I could introduce `sleep`s in each task so that the queue has time to fill up, but it could still fail randomly if for some reason the queue filling is delayed, so it still doesn't guarantee anything...",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11627#issuecomment-1291893648:97,test,test,97,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11627#issuecomment-1291893648,3,['test'],['test']

This is what I also do in the updated cross-check for the simultaneous fit in this PR #11455 ( see the `testRooSimultaneous` file). In 6.24 or older, you would have to further all all these multi-range normalization correction integrals to the RooAddition, like I introduced it under the hood in #7719.

Testability,"Maybe a few more notes to make the review easier, because this is a huge patch. * The previous code used macros to log things. I found that the macros are not needed, so I replaced all the macros with method calls to MnPrint::Error, MnPrint::Info, ....; * The old logging made a useful habit of prefixing messages with a string to indicate the origin, e.g. when you logged from MnHesse, messages would be prefixed with ""MnHesse:"". Inside ``MnHesse``, to stay with the example, you might have seen code like this; ```c++; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some foo happened"");; [...]; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; MN_INFO_MSG(""MnHesse: Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; Setting the prefix by hand was error prone and repetetive and made the logging code more distractive from the actual code. Especially now, since all the debug messages should also have this prefix, I wanted to automate this. So I turned MnPrint into a class that one can instantiate with a prefix for a given scope.; ```c++; MnPrint print(""MnHesse""); // appears once at the beginning of a long method; [...]; print.Info(""Some foo happened"");; [...]; print.Info(""Some bar happened"");; [...]; int n = 5;; print.Info(""Frobinated"", n, ""glorps"");; ```; The method ``MnPrint::Info`` uses the prefix set in the MnPrint ctor. The ctor of MnPrint also has an optional argument to print with a local print level. If this is not set, the global print level is used. In the long run (not in this patch), we should get rid of the global print level, because global mutable variables are difficult to reason about and in particular do not play nice with multi-threading. This design prepares for that step.; * I generally made sure that the logging messages contain the same information as the previous ones, but I reduced excess whitespace and improved the formatting. Some debug messages added several empty lines to the output, which made the logs hard to read.; * In very few isolated cases I removed redundant messages.

Testability,"My bad for not managing to get to this in time. I think most of the logic would go in `GetColumnReader`, in `ColumnReaderUtils`: it would have to create a `TreeColumnReader` if the column is present in the tree and pick the reader for the default value instead. The main complication is dealing with chains in which _some_ trees contain the column and some do not.; The most direct way to do it is leveraging TChain's callback mechanism to switch column readers as needed, but a) TChain's callback mechanism is a mess and b) even if unused TTreeReaderValues for missing branches might emit warnings (unless they are completely destroyed maybe?).; An more roundabout way to do the same would be to change single-thread RDataFrame so that it runs a separate event loop for each sub-tree and never uses a TChain --> you automatically get a call to `GetColumnReader` that can re-evaluate whether the branch or the default value should be used at the start of every new event loop. Finally, you can implement the default as a `Define` that always returns the same number (and in first approximation that's probably the easiest). A slightly nicer underlying implementation would involve a `ConstReader` that explicitly stores a constant value and always returns that same value, but the advantage is unclear -- a good optimizing compiler would elide the call to the lambda that always returns the same number anyways.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8704#issuecomment-1911020478:68,log,logic,68,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8704#issuecomment-1911020478,1,['log'],['logic']

I am not familiar with what `fpu_control.h` does (apparently it has something to do with float precision), but according to [this](https://sourceforge.net/p/jamvm/patches/6/), it should be replaceable by a standard `fenv.h` header file, which I suggest to do (I have not tested it yet, but I will).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9253#issuecomment-963066852:890,test,tested,890,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9253#issuecomment-963066852,1,['test'],['tested']

Testability,"OK thanks. I believe that ""there is no other way to get reliable results"" is a bit of an exaggeration - many numerical libraries and programs do not turn fp exceptions on. IEEE 754 allows them to survive just fine the cases you are hunting down, because (as you certainly know) IEEE 754 brings defined behavior to ""degenerate"" (not in the IEEE 754 sense) cases. As a matter of fact, I believe you have just proven to yourself that ""there is no other way to get reliable results"" is also incorrect, as the optimizer might change fp operations. Yes, GCC tries to keep them ""fp-safe"" but that might change in any of the upcoming versions, just like it did for instance for clang, the Intel compiler, and - if I remember correctly - MSVC. Our approach is not to rely on fp exceptions but on coverage in regression tests. That has limited reach (as would fp exceptions) but it allows us to detect when results change in a visible, ""unreliable"" way.

For 100M entries per thread into 10 branches, the only worse performance I can find is with 64 threads (on `ntpl-perf01`):; ```; ttreeTBufferMergerBranchesVariableRate.00-master.100000000.10.t64.log: Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 5:08.58; ttreeTBufferMergerBranchesVariableRate.01-limit.100000000.10.t64.log: Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 5:12.00; ttreeTBufferMergerBranchesVariableRate.02-no-queue.100000000.10.t64.log: Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 5:16.36; ```.

CMake will figure it out.; - If you want asserts, there's two easy ways to get them:; 1. Configure with `cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE=""-O2 -g"" ...`; 2.

Worst case received order would be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Basically, two constraints are guaranteed: in the first part of the received array the task number increases monotonically and the second part (after 9) decreases monotonically.

Testability,"Ok, I've had a first quick look. This is rather a feature than a bug. During alignment, some bounding boxes and voxels need to be recomputed (see the logic in [TGeoPhysicalNode::Align](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/7c81a10d9fa965b25f35b0ec709d6095a209ac16/geom/geom/src/TGeoPhysicalNode.cxx#L293#L306)). Since a given volume may be changed by many physical node alignments, their bounding boxes and voxels are only marked to be recomputed, otherwise the operation takes too long for complex cases. This lazy recomputation occurs only when any navigation function is called for the given volume, but not when calling just the getter of the box dimensions. So the behavior runtime should be OK, even if you see that some bounding boxes appear to be zero just after alignment. The recomputation of boxes/voxels can be however triggered manually using the following code:; ```; TIter nextv(gGeoManager->GetListOfVolumes());; TGeoVolume *vol;; while ((vol = (TGeoVolume*)nextv())) {; if (vol->IsAssembly()) vol->GetShape()->ComputeBBox();; auto finder = vol->GetVoxels();; if (finder && finder->NeedRebuild()) {; finder->Voxelize();; vol->FindOverlaps();; }; }; ```; I guess this code could be automatically called inside TGeoManager::RefreshPhysicalNodes() which needs to be called anyway by the user to recover pointer consistency after all alignments are applied.

Testability,"Ok, we reached the first milestone: the upgrade builds on all platforms :tada: . The next step is to investigate the failures in ROOT's tests (but please don't look at the last test report from the new CI, it's incomplete because I messed up the paths when uploading the results; it was done properly in https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/13310). We have a couple of failures across all platforms, and the easiest to understand is that LLVM 16 prepends `class` or `struct` less often for C++ class types. Eventually this comes down to (on `master`):; ```; root [0] struct A { A f(); };; root [1] A a; (A &) @0x7f8a3ca38000; root [2] struct A b; (struct A &) @0x7f8a33db2000; ```; whereas LLVM 16 now prints; ```; root [0] struct A { A f(); };; root [1] A a; (A &) @0x7f025c5a6000; root [2] struct A b; (A &) @0x7f025c5a0000; ```. Similarly the following used to output (on `master`):; ```; root [0] struct A { A f(); };; root [1] .Class A; ===========================================================================; struct A; SIZE: 1 FILE: ROOT_prompt_0 LINE: 1; List of member variables: -------------------------------------------------; List of member functions: -------------------------------------------------; filename line:size busy function type and name; (compiled) (NA):(NA) 0 public: struct A f();; ```; while with LLVM 16 we get; ```; (compiled) (NA):(NA) 0 public: A f();; ```; (funnily enough, `struct A { struct A f(); };` still outputs `public: struct A f();` for LLVM 16). This affects a couple of Cling tests and 3 ROOT tests: `roottest-cling-operator-runEqualTest`, `roottest-cling-template-separateDict-make`, and `roottest-cling-template-separateDictNamespace-make`. I propose we just update the expected reference output and be done with it.

Testability,"On the jenkins build node the error appears likely because of '-Dsoversion=""On""' and the following. One test that fails is 'runload.C' in roottest/root/treeformula/sync. There we have (essentially):; ```; {; gROOT->ProcessLine("".L loadcode.C+"");; ...; TTree *t; _file0->GetObject(""t"",t);; }; ```; The use of TTree means that before executing the script libTree is laoded.; During the execution of CompileMacro, the depend library are loaded (see for example the collection line [3363](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/f32d06e70ce357b53050a25eecd5186859021e30/core/base/src/TSystem.cxx#L3363) .; And in this case the result is:; ```; loadcode_C.so libTree.6.21.01.so libTree.so; ```; which coupled with the ***new*** feature that gSystem->Load first dlclose the library then reopen it means that libTree is dlclose 2 or 3 times (one for both the versioned and unversioned version). This behavior is a **very significant** departure from the existing behavior (where, because the libraries were added to the link line, the library were never reloaded). Reloading arbitrary depend library is never a good idea since they (are likely to) include static object that may do things that are **essential** to do only once (initialization, connection to db). Technically CompileMacro could (as it does elsewhere) first check if the library is loaded. But still several questions:. 1) Why is libTree listed twice in the list of depend library?. 2) When should gSystem->Load automatically reload a library, if ever?. @Axel-Naumann @vgvassilev opinions?. PS. Even-though the set of test would be fixed by updating gSystem->Load and/or CompileMacro, the PR is still likely necessary for the case where CompileMacro generates a pcm (and thus need to support reload) or the case where the user explicitly unload a library.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5420#issuecomment-618042721:104,test,test,104,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5420#issuecomment-618042721,2,['test'],['test']

Then `eps_plus` is also `-inf` and so `S` and `A` too, so you `-inf` times something negative (`t` happens to be negative in this example) so the term becomes `+inf` and eventually you get a `-inf + inf` and that equals `nan`. So, there's at least two options to fix this, both will need some conditionals added in again. 1. Going back to the original algorithm. If I understand the commit message of that change correctly, it was mostly removed because it required cached variables. As I rewrote the algorithm above, no more cached variables are necessary. Of course, it does involve more temporary values than the new algorithm, so perhaps this is another reason to pick the new algorithm.; 2. Adding similar `<= 0` checks to the new algorithm. I think this should take place at the call site, because it doesn't make sense for the other `interpolate6thDegree` usecase where no weird values are expected from logarithms. By the way, why is the interpolation taking place in logarithmic space instead of regular linear space and then transformed back into linear space after interpolation? Doesn't this also mean that the two interpolation schemes (FlexibleInterpVar and PiecewiseInterpolation) are again inconsistent? If the logarithm can be eliminated, I think we can do without introducing conditionals, no? That is, assuming the high and low vectors are fi",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13749#issuecomment-1746494427:176,log,log,176,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13749#issuecomment-1746494427,4,['log'],['log']

Testability,"Playing around I have made an observation which is the order of the ROOT and Vc includes makes a difference w.r.t. whether or not `std::sqrt(x)` works with Vc types or not. Previously I was asked in the test application to list the includes first the ROOT ones, then Vc and finally STL. With this order `std::sqrt` does not work with Vc types when used in the GenVector classes. If though I invert the order, and place the Vc includes before the GenVector ones, then the std::sqrt (and I presume others, I have not tested yet though) work with Vc types. Does anyone know if this is intentional or not ? I have not found any documentation for Vc that says anything about its use of the `std::` name space that would explain this. Or perhaps its some feature of the ROOT includes ?. I need to run some more tests to see if it really fixes all the issues with the gcc builds, but if so I guess its a possible workaround, although I confess I don't really like situations where the order of includes makes a difference.

Testability,"Regarding the titular issue, I have been thinking about it for a bit and I don't think we can do much better than what @pieterdavid already implemented. Solutions considered:. 1. Implicitly converting `TClonesArrays` to `RVecs` would be a) backward-incompatible and b) a silent perf degradation, as it requires a copy. Moreover, if we did this I don't see a migration path that doesn't require that users revise all their TClonesArrays-related logic; 2. Adding a `TClonesArrays2RVec` helper function: it would require a copy (or it would have to return a clunky `RVec<T*>`). It is also trivial to implement for users that need it and don't mind the downsides.; 3. Adding a RDF toggle to tweak ""read TClonesArrays as RVecs"" or not: requires adding a bunch of extra logic to the column-reading mechanism for a feature that might end up being mostly unused (modern data models don't use TClonesArrays), and it would require the extra copy (i.e. silent performance degradation). The best seems to be 3, but feature toggles complicate internals and are typically not easy to discover (might end up mostly unused). It seems simpler to ask users to explicitly do the conversion in a `Redefine` if they need/want to. Sorry I could not come up with something nice :confused: . I will close this in a few days unless people have something against it.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8644#issuecomment-883552286:444,log,logic,444,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/8644#issuecomment-883552286,2,['log'],['logic']

Testability,"Replying to two different comments:. ### 1. > they are automatically inline and should not need the definition out-of-line. My standardese is poor, but reading https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0386r2.pdf : ; Line starting with `n 9.2.3.2p3, change:`; > An inline static data member can be defined in the class definition and may specify; a brace or equal initializer. If the member is declared with the constexpr specifier, it may be; redeclared in namespace scope with no initializer (this usage is deprecated; see D.X). So it says that the usage is deprecated, but it *may* still be used. I couldn't find any specific document on whether the main compiler vendors actually implement this change, since it is not strictly enforced maybe it's just not there?. ### 2. > Would be interesting to know how inline const behaves... So with the patch; ```; diff --git a/core/base/inc/TString.h b/core/base/inc/TString.h; index 58b47530fd..b74fe29e5c 100644; --- a/core/base/inc/TString.h; +++ b/core/base/inc/TString.h; @@ -277,7 +277,7 @@ private:; public:; enum EStripType { kLeading = 0x1, kTrailing = 0x2, kBoth = 0x3 };; enum ECaseCompare { kExact, kIgnoreCase };; - static const Ssiz_t kNPOS = ::kNPOS;; + static inline const Ssiz_t kNPOS = ::kNPOS;; ; TString(); // Null string; explicit TString(Ssiz_t ic); // Suggested capacity; ```.

Testability,"Results of today's investigations: The reason is that `LinkageComputer::getLVForNamespaceScopeDecl` assigns internal linkage to `const` qualified variables without external storage class, which then our `KeepLocalGVPass` changes to a weak symbol. If that happens in multiple transactions, the JIT infrastructure (?) merges the symbols into one memory location but constructors and destructors run multiple times on the same object (see above). We cannot disable `KeepLocalGVPass` because it also takes care of `static` variables in functions that are lazily initialized. Additionally, not merging the constant variables would mean that they have different addresses which could also cause problems (FWIW this is what you get upstream in `clang-repl`). Fun fact: it works by accident in the upgrade to LLVM 16 because I backported https://reviews.llvm.org/D156537, but not https://reviews.llvm.org/D156897 so if a variable `MustBeEmitted` it is actually not re-emitted and `KeepLocalGVPass` works correctly. Conclusion: What I think we should really do here is patch `LinkageComputer::getLVForNamespaceScopeDecl` to not assign internal linkage to `const` qualified variables under `IncrementalExtensions`.

Testability,"Right, of course the tests are correctly failing now where they still use `Offset` for the `NewStyle` likelihoods :). We should probably do two things to finish this PR:; 1. Add a test somewhere (I guess `testLikelihoodGradientJob.cxx` is as good a place as any) that fails when creating a likelihood with the two arguments together. The test can simply check whether the output of `createNLL` is `0`.; 2. Remove `Offset` from the `NewStyle` likelihood creation lines. _Side note:_ I think it would be much better if [`createNLL` just throws here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/src/RooAbsPdf.cxx#L1032) instead of returning zero and causing segfaults along the way.

[DF] Avoid calling InitSlot/FinaliseSlot multiple times on RDefines. Before this commit, each action and filter was calling InitSlot on all; the defines it knew about. As a consequence, RDefine had to keep track; of whether InitSlot was already called on it for a given task and a; given slot. We can avoid the multiple InitSlot calls on the same objects and the; book-keeping of whether the call already happened or not by having; RLoopManager call InitSlot on every defined column once per task and per; slot. To this end, we need to register RDefine objects with the; RLoopManager when they are created and deregister them when they are; destroyed. tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RAction.hxx | 14 +++++++-------; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RBookedDefines.hxx | 5 +++++; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RDefine.hxx | 20 ++++++--------------; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RDefineBase.hxx | 1 -; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RFilter.hxx | 14 ++++++--------; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RInterface.hxx | 8 +++++---; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RJittedDefine.hxx | 1 +; tree/dataframe/inc/ROOT/RDF/RLoopManager.hxx | 4 ++++; tree/dataframe/src/RDFBookedDefines.cxx | 5 +++++; tree/dataframe/src/RDefineBase.cxx | 10 ++++------; tree/dataframe/src/RJittedDefine.cxx | 6 ++++++; tree/dataframe/src/RLoopManager.cxx | 15 +++++++++++++++; 12 files changed, 64 insertions(+), 39 deletions(-); ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10007#issuecomment-1057004565:16,test,testing,16,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/10007#issuecomment-1057004565,2,['test'],"['test', 'testing']"
