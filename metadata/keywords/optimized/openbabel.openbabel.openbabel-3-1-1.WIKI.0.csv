Free Form Fractional format (fract)#; General purpose crystallographic format; The “free-form” fractional format attempts to allow for input from a; range of fractional / crystallography file formats. As such, it has only; a few restrictions on input:. Line one of the file contains a title or comment.; Line two of the file contains the unit cell parameters separated by; whitespace and/or commas (i.e. “a b c alpha beta gamma”).; Any remaining lines are parsed for atom information. Lines start with; the element symbol, followed by fractional X, Y, and Z coordinates; (in angstroms) separated by whitespace. Any numeric input (i.e., unit cell parameters, XYZ coordinates) can include; designations of errors, although this is currently ignored. For example:; C 1.00067(3) 2.75(2) 3.0678(12). will be parsed as:; C 1.00067 2.75 3.0678.

Test using a command-line executable#; At the command-line we can calculate the molecular weight of ethanol as shown below. We are going to do something similar using the Python test framework:; > obabel -:CCO --append MW -otxt; 46.0684. Open test/testbabel.py in an editor. I have grouped tests related to the obabel executable into a class testOBabel, so let’s add a new test there. Somewhere in that class (for example, at the end), add a function such as the following (note: it must begin with the word “test”):; def testMolWtEthanol(self):; """"""Check the molecular weight of ethanol""""""; self.canFindExecutable(""obabel""); answers = [; (""CCO"", 46.07),; (""[H]"", 1.01),; (""[2H]"", 2.01),; ]; for smi, molwt in answers:; output, error = run_exec('obabel -:%s --append mw -otxt' % smi); my_molwt = round(float(output), 2); self.assertEqual(my_molwt, molwt).

Behind the scenes, it adds the full path to the named executable. In the example above, run_exec(stdin, command) took a single argument; the next example will show its use with two arguments - the additional argument is a string which is treated as stdin, and piped through the executable.; In the previous example, each SMILES string was passed in one-at-a-time.

Availability," As open source software, your code is read by many, many people.; Different contributions have often had different indentation styles. Simply making the code indentation consistent across an entire file makes the code easier to read.; The current accepted scheme for Open Babel is a default indent of two spaces, and use of spaces instead of tabs.; For tips on changing your editor to use this indentation style, please e-mail the openbabel-devel list.

Code Maintenance#. Minimize #if/#endif conditional compilation. Some is required for portability, but these should be minimized where possible. If there seems to be some magic #define which accesses parts of the file, it’s probably dead code. As above, dead code makes it harder to maintain and read everything else.; Removing calls to cout, cerr, STDOUT, perror etc. These should use the global error reporting code.; Minimize warnings from compilers (e.g., GCC flags -Wextra -Wall). Sometimes these are innocuous, but it’s usually better to fix the problems before they become bugs.; Use static code analysis tools to find potential bugs in the code and remove them.; Insure proper use of atom and bond iterators, e.g., FOR_ATOMS_OF_MOL rather than atom or bond index access, which will break if indexing changes.

Substructure and similarity searching a large dataset#; Open Babel provides a format called the fs -- fastsearch index which should be used when searching large datasets (like ChEMBL) for molecules similar to a particular query. There are faster ways of searching (like using a chemical database) but FastSearch is convenient, and should give reasonable performance for most people.; To demonstrate similarity searching, we will use the first 1000 molecules in the latest release of ChEMBL:. Download the 2D SDF version of ChEMBL, chembl_nn.sdf.gz, from the ChEMBLdb download site and save in your Work folder. (Note: this is a gzipped file, but Open Babel will handle this without problems.); Set up an SDF to SDF conversion, set chembl_nn.sdf.gz as the input file and 1000_chembl.sdf as the output file.; Only convert the first 1000 molecules by entering 1000 in the box End import at molecule # specified. Click CONVERT. We can going to use the following structure for substructure and similarity searching. It can be represented by the SMILES string Nc1ccc(N)cc1. How the search works; Behind the scenes, the FastSearch index simply stores a path-based; binary fingerprint for each molecule. When used to search, similarity; is measured based on the Tanimoto coefficient. For exact search, hits; are verified by Open Babel’s graph isomorphism matcher. Next, we will create a FastSearch index for this dataset of 1000 molecules:. Convert 1000_chembl.sdf from SDF to FS format, with an output filename of 1000_chembl.fs.

Availability," just want to compile stuff yourself. We understand. Open Babel can be compiled on Linux, MacOSX, BSDs and other Unixes, and also on Windows (with Cygwin, MinGW or MSVC). Requirements#; To build Open Babel, you need the following:. The source code for the latest release of Open Babel; A C++ compiler. Open Babel is written in standards-compliant C++. The best-supported compilers are GCC 4 and MSVC++ 2008, but it also compiles with Clang and Intel Compiler 11. CMake 2.8 or newer. Open Babel uses CMake as its build system. CMake is an open source cross-platform build system from KitWare.; You need to install CMake 2.8 or newer. This is available as a binary package from the KitWare website; alternatively, it may be available through your package manager (on Linux). If necessary, you can also compile it yourself from the source code. If you want to build the GUI (Graphical User Interface), you need the following in addition:. wxWidgets 2.8 (or newer). Binary packages may be available through your package manager (wx-common, wx2.8-headers and libwxbase2.8-dev on Ubuntu) or from http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/. Otherwise, you could try compiling it yourself from the source code. The following are optional when compiling Open Babel, but if not available some features will be missing:. libxml2 development headers are required to read/write CML files and other XML formats (the libxml2-dev package in Ubuntu); zlib development libraries are required to support reading gzipped files (the zlib1g-dev package in Ubuntu); Eigen version 2 or newer is required if using the language bindings in the release. In addition, if it not present, some API classes (OBAlign, OBConformerSearch) and plugins (the QEq and QTPIE charge models, the --conformer and --align operations) will not be available.; Eigen may be available through your package manager (the libeigen2-dev package in Ubuntu).

If you need to specify them, try using the -DZLIB_LIBRARY=wherever option with CMake to specify the location of the DLL or SO file, and -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR=wherever to specify the location of the header files.; What environment variables affect how Open Babel finds formats, plugins and libraries?. LD_LIBRARY_PATH - Used to find the location of the libopenbabel.so file.You should set this if you get error messages about not being able to find libopenbabel.so. BABEL_LIBDIR - Used to find plugins such as the file formatsIf obabel -L formats does not list any file formats, then you need to set this environment variable to the directory where the file formats were installed, typically /usr/local/lib/openbabel/. BABEL_DATADIR - Used to find the location of the data files used for fingerprints, forcefields, etc.If you get errors about not being able to find some .txt files, then you should set this to the name of the folder containing files such as patterns.txt and MACCS.txt. These are typically installed to /usr/local/share/openbabel. Advanced build options#; How do I control whether the tests are built?; The CMake option -DENABLE_TESTS=ON or OFF will look after this. To actually run the tests, use make tests.; How do I do a debug build?; -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug does a debug build (gcc -g). To revert to a regular build use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release.; How do I see what commands cmake is using to build?; Run Make as follows:; $ VERBOSE=1 make. How do I build one specific target?; Just specify the target when running Make. The following just builds the Python bindings:; $ make _openbabel. To speed things up, you can ask Make to ignore dependencies:; $ make _openbabel/fast. How do I create the SWIG bindings?; Use the -DRUN_SWIG=ON option with CMake. This requires SWIG 2.0 or newer.

If this is not available for your Linux distribution, you should compile Open Babel yourself. Compiling Open Babel#; Open Babel is written in C++. Compiling is the process of turning this C++ into instructions that the computer’s processor can understand, machine code.; Although pre-compiled (or “binary”) packages are available for several platforms, there are several reasons you might want to compile Open Babel yourself:. The current release (openbabel-3-1-1) of Open Babel is not available for your platform. We recommend always using the latest release.; You want more control over the features available. For example, perhaps you want the Python bindings but these were not included in your distribution.; You want to use the latest development code.; You want to add a new feature. It is easy to add new formats or operations to Open Babel as it has a plugin architecture (see Adding plugins).; You just want to compile stuff yourself. We understand. Open Babel can be compiled on Linux, MacOSX, BSDs and other Unixes, and also on Windows (with Cygwin, MinGW or MSVC). Requirements#; To build Open Babel, you need the following:. The source code for the latest release of Open Babel; A C++ compiler. Open Babel is written in standards-compliant C++. The best-supported compilers are GCC 4 and MSVC++ 2008, but it also compiles with Clang and Intel Compiler 11. CMake 2.8 or newer. Open Babel uses CMake as its build system.

Fingerprint format#; The Fingerprint format (fpt) is a utility file format that provides access to a number of substructure-based fingerprints, and that enables the user to carry out similarity and substructure searching. You can see the available fingerprints using the following command:; $ babel -L fingerprints; FP2 Indexes linear fragments up to 7 atoms.; FP3 SMARTS patterns specified in the file patterns.txt; FP4 SMARTS patterns specified in the file SMARTS_InteLigand.txt; MACCS SMARTS patterns specified in the file MACCS.txt. At present there are four types of fingerprints:. FP2, a path-based fingerprint which indexes small molecule fragments based on linear segments of up to 7 atoms (somewhat similar to the Daylight fingerprints):. A molecule structure is analysed to identify linear fragments of length from 1-7 atoms. Single atom fragments of C, N, and O are ignored. A fragment is terminated when the atoms form a ring.; For each of these fragments the atoms, bonding and whether they constitute a complete ring is recorded and saved in a set so that there is only one of each fragment type. Chemically identical versions, (i.e. ones with the atoms listed in reverse order and rings listed starting at different atoms) are identified and only a single canonical fragment ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Fingerprints/fingerprints.html:1174,avail,available,1174,docs/Fingerprints/fingerprints.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Fingerprints/fingerprints.html,2,['avail'],['available']

As just described, the flow of information is from the 3D coordinates to Open Babel’s internal record of stereo centers, and this flow is triggered by calling stereo perception (which does nothing if the stereo is marked as already perceived). It follows from this that altering the coordinates after stereo perception (e.g. by reflecting through an axis, thereby inverting chirality) has no affect on the internal stereo data. If operations are performed on the molecule that require stereo is be reperceived, then OBMol::SetChiralityPerceived(false) should be called.; It should also be clear from the discussion above that changing the stereo data (e.g. using SetConfig() to invert a tetrahedral stereocenter) has no affect on the molecule’s coordinates (though it may affect downstream processing, such as the information written to a SMILES string). If this is needed, the user will have to manipulate the coordinates themselves, or generate coordinates for the whole molecule using the associated library functions (e.g. the --gen3d operation).; 2D structures; 2D structures represent a depiction of a molecule, where stereochemistry is usually indicated by wedge or hash bonds. It is sometimes indicated by adopting particular conventions (e.g. the Fischer or Haworth projection of monosaccharides). It should be noted that Open Babel does not support any of these conventions, nor does it support the use of wedge or hash bonds for perspective drawing (e.g. where a thick bond is supported by two wedges). This may change in future, of course, but it’s worth noting that Open Babel is not the only toolkit with these limitations and so what you think you are storing in your database may not be what the ‘computer’ thinks it is.; Stereo centers ar",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:11098,down,downstream,11098,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,2,['down'],['downstream']

User Guide; Write software using the Open Babel library; The Open Babel API. The Open Babel API#; The API (Application Programming Interface) is the set of classes, methods and variables that a programming library provides to the user. The Open Babel API is implemented in C++, but the same set of classes, methods and variables are accessed through the various language bindings.; The API documentation is automatically generated from the source code using the Doxygen tool. The following links point to the various versions of the documentation:. API for the current release; API for the development version (updated nightly, with error report showing errors in documentation); API for specific versions: 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3. The Open Babel toolkit uses a version numbering that indicates how the API has changed over time:. Bug fix releases (e.g., 2.0.0, vs. 2.0.1) do not change API at all.; Minor versions (e.g., 2.0 vs. 2.1) will add function calls, but will be otherwise backwards-compatible.; Major versions (e.g. 2 vs 3) are not backwards-compatible, and have changes in the API. Overall, our goal is for the Open Babel API to remain stable over as long a period as possible. This means that users can be confident that their code will continue to work despite the release of new versions with additional features, file formats and bug fixes. For example, at the time of writing we have been on the version 2 series for almost five years (since November 2005).

Fixed some bugs in; 1.100.1 and added additional improvments.; Support for the command-line “babel” program to convert some or; all structures in a file with multiple molecules. By default this; version will convert all molecules in a file. To change this, use; the -f and -l command-line options as documented in the man page.; Isotope support, including exact masses in the “report” file; format and SMILES data.; Updated API documentation.; Support for the Borland C++ compiler.; Fixed a variety of bugs in the PDB file format support, including; better bond typing.; Support for output of residue information in the Sybyl Mol2 file; format.; Some support for conversion of unit cell information, both in the; library and in some file formats (i.e. DMol3, Cacao).; Coordinates now use double-precision floating point libraries for; greater accuracy in conversions.; Fixed a variety of bugs uncovered in roundtrip testing.; Fixed a bug when attempting to perceive bond information on 2D; structures.; Fixed several rare bugs that could cause segmentation faults.

Availability,"axed with respect to aromaticity. Large datasets#; First of all, you need to create a fastsearch index (see above). The index is created with the following command:; babel mymols.sdf -ofs. Substructure searching is as for small datasets, except that the fastsearch index is used instead of the original file. This command will find all molecules containing 1,2-dicyanobenzene and return the results as SMILES strings:; babel mymols.fs -ifs -sN#Cc1ccccc1C#N results.smi. If all you want output are the molecule names then adding -xt will return just the molecule names:; babel mymols.fs -ifs -sN#Cc1ccccc1C#N results.smi -xt. Case study: Search ChEMBLdb#; This case study uses a combination of the techniques described above for similarity searching using large databases and using small databases. Note that we are using the default fingerprint for all of these analyses. The default fingerprint is FP2, a path-based fingerprint (somewhat similar to the Daylight fingerprints). Download Version 2 of ChEMBLdb from ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/ChEMBLdb/releases/.; After unzipping it, make a fastsearch index (this took 18 minutes on my machine for the 500K+ molecules):; babel chembl_02.sdf -ofs. Let’s use the first molecule in the sdf file as a query. Using Notepad (or on Linux, head -79 chembl_02.sdf) extract the first molecule and save it as first.sdf. Note that the molecules in the ChEMBL sdf do not have titles; instead, their IDs are stored in the “chebi_id” property field.; This first molecule is 100183. Check its ChEMBL page. It’s pretty weird, but is there anything similar in ChEMBLdb? Let’s find the 5 most similar molecules:; babel chembl_02.fs mostsim.sdf -s first.sdf -at5. The results are stored in mostsim.sdf, but how similar are these molecules to the query?:; babel first.sdf mostsim.sdf -ofpt; >; > Tanimoto from first mol = 1; Possible superstructure of first mol; > Tanimoto from first mol = 0.986301; > Tanimoto from first mol = 0.924051; Possible superstructu",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Fingerprints/fingerprints.html:7874,Down,Download,7874,docs/Fingerprints/fingerprints.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Fingerprints/fingerprints.html,1,['Down'],['Download']

For example, many quantum mechanics formats (as well as other formats which do not recognize bonds) offer the following options:; -as Call only :obapi:`OBMol::ConnectTheDots() <OpenBabel::OBMol::ConnectTheDots>` (single bonds only); -ab No bond perception. Make sure to use generic data classes like :obapi:`OBUnitCell` and others as appropriate. If your format stores any sort of common data types, consider adding a subclass of :obapi:`OBGenericData` for use by other formats and user code.; Please make sure to add several example files to the test set repository. Ideally, these should work several areas of your import code – in the end, the more robust the test set, the more stable and useful Open Babel will be. The test files should include at least one example of a correct file and one example of an invalid file (i.e., something which will properly be ignored and not crash babel).; Make sure to document your format using the string returned by Description(). At the minimum this should include a description of all options, along with examples. However, the more information you add (e.g. unimplemented features, applications of the format, and so forth) the more confident users will be in using it.; That’s it!

As a result, the principal documentation is the Open Babel C++ API documentation. A few differences exist, however:. Global variables, global functions and constants in the C++ API can be found in org.openbabel.openbabel_java. The variables are accessible through get methods.; When accessing various types of :obapi:`OBGenericData`, you will need to cast them to the particular subclass using the global functions, toPairData, toUnitCell, etc.; The Java versions of the iterator classes in the C++ API (that is, all those classes ending in Iter) implement the Iterator and Iterable interfaces.

As open source software, your code is read by many, many people.; Different contributions have often had different indentation styles. Simply making the code indentation consistent across an entire file makes the code easier to read.; The current accepted scheme for Open Babel is a default indent of two spaces, and use of spaces instead of tabs.; For tips on changing your editor to use this indentation style, please e-mail the openbabel-devel list. Delete code which is commented out. The SVN version control system maintains history, so if we need it later, we can go back and get that code. Dead code like this simply makes it harder to read the important code!; Marking areas of code which use :obapi:`OBAtom::GetIdx() <OpenBabel::OBAtom::GetIdx>` or other accesses to atom indexes, which may break when atom indexing changes. Code Maintenance#. Minimize #if/#endif conditional compilation. Some is required for portability, but these should be minimized where possible. If there seems to be some magic #define which accesses parts of the file, it’s probably dead code. As above, dead code makes it harder to maintain and read everything else.; Removing calls to cout, cerr, STDOUT, perror etc. These should use the global error reporting code.; Minimize warnings from compilers (e.g., GCC flags -Wextra -Wall). Sometimes these are innocuous, but it’s usually better to fix the problems before they become bugs.; Use static code analysis tools to find potential bugs in the code and remove them.; Insure proper use of atom and bond iterators, e.g., FOR_ATOMS_OF_MOL rather than atom or bond index access, which will break if indexing changes.

Availability,"e yourself, recompile and have the problem fixed very quickly.; If you’re inclined to write code, the GPL is an excellent option for the academic. You’re the original copyright holder, so you can do whatever you want with the code, in addition to selling it. But if you’ve also licensed it under the GPL, no one can distribute it as proprietary (i.e., closed-source) software without your agreement. Fellow academics can use it directly, learn from it, improve it and contribute back to you. Isn’t that why many of us went into science?; Once licensed under the GPL, the code must remain free to interested parties. If someone modifies it, that code must still remain under the GPL, free for all.; What’s in it for an open-source software project?; Certainly the answers for closed-source software and academics also apply for you. Beyond that, if your code is compatible with the GPL, you can directly use Open Babel and all of the API. This is already happening with the Avogadro molecular editor, available under the GPL, and many others (see related projects). There’s a lot of code in Open Babel beyond file translation and more to come. Why reinvent the wheel?; Why is this covered under the GPL instead of license X?; The short answer is that OpenEye Scientific Software employs Matt Stahl, one of the authors of the original Babel. They released a library called OELib under the GPL that did many things that Babel did. Later they decided to release the next version of OELib as a closed-source project–their choice for their code. We took the version of OELib still under GPL and went from there.; If you’d like to see Open Babel licensed differently, we’d suggest asking OpenEye if they’d consider releasing the old code under a new license, e.g. the LGPL. At that point, we’d consider whether Open Babel should be relicensed or not. Obviously all copyright holders must agree to the new license.; It’s worth noting that since OpenEye is developing a closed-source library called OEChem and ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Introduction/faq.html:9369,avail,available,9369,docs/Introduction/faq.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Introduction/faq.html,2,['avail'],['available']

These classes are derived from a common base class, OBFormat, which is in the Conversion Control module. They also make use of the chemical routines in the Chemical Core module. Each format file contains a global object of the format class. When the format is loaded the class constructor registers the presence of the class with OBConversion.

Supported File Formats and Options; Descriptors; Charge models; Release Notes. User Guide; Adding plugins. Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and Martinez, 2007). To add a new plugin of any type, the general method is very simple:.

Availability,"ge any existing code. Error Handling and Warnings#; The general philosophy of the Open Babel project is to attempt to gracefully recover from error conditions. Depending on the severity of the error, a message may or may not be sent to the user – users can filter out developer debugging messages and minor errors, but should be notified of significant problems.; Errors and warnings in Open Babel are handled internally by a flexible system motivated by a few factors:. End users often do not wish to be deluged by debugging or other messages during operation.; Other developers may wish to redirect or filter error/warning output (e.g., in a GUI).; The operation of Open Babel should be open to developers and users alike to monitor an “audit trail” of operations on files and molecules, and debug the program and library itself when the need arises. Multiple error/warning levels exist and should be used by code.

Availability,"helper format.; The objects passed between the modules in the diagram above are polymorphic :obapi:`OBBase` pointers. This means that the conversion framework can be used by any object derived from OBBase (which essentially means anything - chemical or not). Most commonly these refer to OBMol objects, less commonly to OBReaction objects, but could be extended to anything else without needing to change any existing code. Error Handling and Warnings#; The general philosophy of the Open Babel project is to attempt to gracefully recover from error conditions. Depending on the severity of the error, a message may or may not be sent to the user – users can filter out developer debugging messages and minor errors, but should be notified of significant problems.; Errors and warnings in Open Babel are handled internally by a flexible system motivated by a few factors:. End users often do not wish to be deluged by debugging or other messages during operation.; Other developers may wish to redirect or filter error/warning output (e.g., in a GUI).; The operation of Open Babel should be open to developers and users alike to monitor an “audit trail” of operations on files and molecules, and debug the program and library itself when the need arises. Multiple error/warning levels exist and should be used by code. These are defined in the :obapi:`obMessageLevel` enum as follows:. obError – for critical errors (e.g., cannot read a file); obWarning – for non-critical problems (e.g., molecule appears empty); obInfo – for informative messages (e.g., file is a non-standard format); obAuditMsg – for messages auditing methods which destroy or perceive molecular data (e.g., kekulization, atom typing, etc.); obDebug – for messages only useful for debugging purposes.

Install a binary package#. Windows#; Open Babel is available as a binary installer for Windows, both 64-bit (preferred) or 32-bit (indicated by x86 in the filename). It includes several command-line tools as well as a graphical user interface (GUI). The latest version can be download from GitHub.; Advanced users may be interested in compiling Open Babel themselves (see Compiling Open Babel).

If this is not available for your Linux distribution, you should compile Open Babel yourself. Compiling Open Babel#; Open Babel is written in C++. Compiling is the process of turning this C++ into instructions that the computer’s processor can understand, machine code.; Although pre-compiled (or “binary”) packages are available for several platforms, there are several reasons you might want to compile Open Babel yourself:. The current release (openbabel-3-1-1) of Open Babel is not available for your platform. We recommend always using the latest release.; You want more control over the features available. For example, perhaps you want the Python bindings but these were not included in your distribution.; You want to use the latest development code.; You want to add a new feature.

Lazy Evaluation#; The :obapi:`OBMol::BeginModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::BeginModify>` and :obapi:`OBMol::EndModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::EndModify>` calls are part of Open Babel’s lazy evaluation mechanism.; In some cases, code may desire to make a large number of changes to an OBMol object at once. Ideally, this should all happen without triggering unintended perception routines. Therefore, the BeginModify() call marks the beginning of such code, and EndModify() triggers any needed updates of lazy evaluation methods.; For example:; mol.BeginModify();; double x,y,z;; OBAtom *atom;; vector<string> vs;. for (i = 1; i <= natoms; i ++); {; if (!ifs.getline(buffer,BUFF_SIZE)); return(false);; tokenize(vs,buffer);; if (vs.size() != 4); return(false);. atom = mol.NewAtom();; x = atof((char*)vs[1].c_str());; y = atof((char*)vs[2].c_str());; z = atof((char*)vs[3].c_str());. atom->SetVector(x,y,z); //set coordinates; atom->SetAtomicNum(atoi(vs[0].c_str())); // set atomic number; }; mol.ConnectTheDots();; mol.PerceiveBondOrders();; mol.EndModify();. This code reads in a list of atoms with XYZ coordinates and the atomic number in the first column (vs[0]).

Modular design of code base#; Since version 2.0, Open Babel has had a modular structure. Particularly for the use of Open Babel as a chemical file format converter, it aims to:. separate the chemistry, the conversion process and the user interfaces, reducing, as far as possible, the dependency of one on another.; put all the code for each chemical format in one place (usually a single cpp file) and make the addition of new formats simple.; allow the format conversion of not just molecules, but also any other chemical objects, such as reactions. The structure of the Open Babel codebase broken down into modules#. The separate parts of the OpenBabel program are:. The Chemical core, which contains OBMol etc. and has all the chemical structure description and manipulation. This bit is the heart of the application and its API can be used as a chemical toolbox. It has no input/output capabilities.; The Formats, which read and write to files of different types. These classes are derived from a common base class, OBFormat, which is in the Conversion Control module. They also make use of the chemical routines in the Chemical Core module. Each format file contains a global object of the format class. When the format is loaded the class constructor registers the presence of the class with OBConversion. This means the formats are plugins - new formats can be added without changing any framework code.; Common Formats include OBMoleculeFormats and XMLBaseFormat from which most other formats (like Format A and Format B in the diagram) are derived.

User Guide; The Open Babel GUI. The Open Babel GUI#; The obabel command line program converts chemical objects (currently molecules or reactions) from one file format to another. The Open Babel graphical user interface (GUI) is an; alternative to using the command line and has the same capabilities. Since Open Babel 2.3, the GUI is available cross-platform on Windows, Linux and MacOSX. On Windows, you can find it in the Start Menu in the Open Babel folder; on Linux and MacOSX, the GUI can be started with the obgui command.; Since the functionality of the GUI mirrors that of obabel, you should consult the previous chapter to learn about available features and how to use them. This chapter describes the general use of the GUI and then focuses on features that are specific to the GUI.

Subsequently,; clicking “Use restricted set of formats” on the View menu toggles; this facility on and off.; Using a restricted set overcomes an irritating bug in the Windows; version. In the file Open and Save dialogs the files displayed can; be filtered by the current format, All Chemical Formats, or All; Files. The All Chemical Formats filter will only display the first; 30 possible formats (alphabetically). The All Files will indeed; display all files and the conversion processes are unaffected. Other features#; Most of the interface parameters, such as the selected format and; the window size and position, are remembered between sessions.; Using the View menu, the input and output text boxes can be set not; to wrap the text. At present you have to restart the program for; this to take effect.; The message box at the top of the output text window receives; program output on error and audit logging, and some progress; reports. It can be expanded by dragging down the divider between; the windows. Example files#; In the Windows distribution, there are three chemical files included to try out:. serotonin.mol which has 3D atom coordinates; oxamide.cml which is 2D and has a large number of properties that will be seen when converting to SDF; FourSmallMols.cml which (unsurprisingly) contains four molecules with no atom coordinates and can be used to illustrate the handling of multiple molecules:; Setting the output format to SMI (which is easy to see), you can convert only the second and third molecules by entering 2 and 3 in the appropriate option boxes.

There are no restrictions on use of Open Babel code for personal projects, regardless of where you work (academia, industry, … wherever).; However, if you intend on releasing a software package that uses Open Babel code, the GPL requires that your package be released under the GNU GPL license.

It takes one parameter which probably needs to be enclosed in double quotes to avoid confusing the shell or operating system. (You don’t need the quotes with the Windows GUI.) The parameter contains one or more conditional tests. By default, these have all to be true for the molecule to be converted. As well as this implicit AND behaviour, you can write a full Boolean expression (see below). As you can see, there can be spaces or not in sensible places and the conditional tests could be separated by a comma or semicolon.; You can filter on two types of property:. An SDF property, as the identifier ROTATABLE_BOND could be. There is no need for it to be previously known to Open Babel.; A descriptor name (internally, an ID of an OBDescriptor object). This is a plug-in class so that new objects can easily be added. MW is the ID of a descriptor which calculates molecular weight. You can see a list of available descriptors using:; obabel -L descriptors. or from a menu item in the GUI. Faster filtering; Open Babel provides a number of utility file formats (see Supported File Formats and Options). Of these, using the copy format as the output format is particularly useful when filtering (see Copy raw text (copy)). This copies the content of the molecular file directly from input to output. If you are not converting the molecules between different formats, this procedure is much faster and avoids any possibility of information loss.; In addition, if you are converting SDF files and are filtering based on the title, you should consider using -aT (see MDL MOL format (mdl, mol, sd, sdf)). Rather than perceiving the chemistry of the entire molecule, this option will only read in the title. The descriptor names are case-insensitive. With the property names currently, you need to get the case right. Both types of identifier can contain letters, numbers and underscores, ‘_’.

Please cite this paper if you use the coordinate generation features in Open Babel.; The functionality of OBBuilder is not directly available through obabel but it is used as the necessary first step of the Gen3D operation discussed below. Conformer searching#; Given a 3D structure, the goal of conformer searching is to find a low energy conformation. This may be useful as a “clean-up” procedure after an initial 3D structure generation. Note that conformer searching does not alter stereochemistry.; The Open Babel library provides access to several algorithms for conformer searching. All of these algorithms adopt the torsion-driving approach; that is, conformations are generated by setting torsion angles to one of a number of allowed values. The allowed values are listed in the data file torlib.txt; for example, C-C bonds in alkanes have three allowed values: -60, 60 and 180. :obapi:`Systematic Rotor Search <SystematicRotorSearch>`: Systematically; iterate through all possible; conformers according to Open Babel’s torsion library.; This approach is thorough and will; find the global minimum.

Windows#; Open Babel is available as a binary installer for Windows, both 64-bit (preferred) or 32-bit (indicated by x86 in the filename). It includes several command-line tools as well as a graphical user interface (GUI). The latest version can be download from GitHub.; Advanced users may be interested in compiling Open Babel themselves (see Compiling Open Babel).

If this is not available for your Linux distribution, you should compile Open Babel yourself. Compiling Open Babel#; Open Babel is written in C++. Compiling is the process of turning this C++ into instructions that the computer’s processor can understand, machine code.; Although pre-compiled (or “binary”) packages are available for several platforms, there are several reasons you might want to compile Open Babel yourself:. The current release (openbabel-3-1-1) of Open Babel is not available for your platform. We recommend always using the latest release.; You want more control over the features available. For example, perhaps you want the Python bindings but these were not included in your distribution.; You want to use the latest development code.; You want to add a new feature. It is easy to add new formats or operations to Open Babel as it has a plugin architecture (see Adding plugins).; You just want to compile stuff yourself. We understand. Open Babel can be compiled on Linux, MacOSX, BSDs and other Unixes, and also on Windows (with Cygwin, MinGW or MSVC). Requirements#; To build Open Babel, you need the following:.

If you wanted to also include all the molecules without ROTATABLE_BOND defined, use:; obabel filterset.sdf -osmi --filter ""!ROTATABLE_BOND || (ROTATABLE_BOND & MW<130)"". The ! means negate. AND can be & or &&, OR can be | or ||. The brackets are not strictly necessary here because & has precedent over | in the normal way. If the result of a test doesn’t matter, it is parsed but not evaluated. In the example, the expression in the brackets is not evaluated for molecules without a ROTATABLE_BOND property. This doesn’t matter here, but if evaluation of a descriptor involved a lot of computation, it would pay to include it late in the boolean expression so that there is a chance it is skipped for some molecules.; Descriptors must have a conditional test and it is an error if they don’t. The default test, as used by MW or logP, is a numerical one, but the parsing of the text, and what the test does is defined in each descriptor’s code (a virtual function in the OBDescriptor class).

The original Babel is hosted by Smog.com on a Babel homepage, by the Computational Chemistry List (CCL) and of course by Open Babel at SourceForge.net.; Along the way, the two original authors started a rewrite of Babel into C++ they called OBabel, which was never really publicly released. But Matt used some of these ideas in OELib, which was generously released under the GNU GPL by his employer, OpenEye Software, and the last known version of this OELib is still available from our file repository.; OpenEye decided that for their purposes OELib needed a rewrite (now called OEChem), but this would be closed-source to include some advanced algorithms. So the GPL’ed version of OELib would not be maintained. Instead, the free version of OELib was renamed and has become “Open Babel” with the blessing of Matt and other contributors.; Open Babel has evolved quite a lot since its birth in 2001.; What’s the latest version?; As of this writing, the latest version is Open Babel openbabel-3-1-1.

Availability,"roup is expanded and the ‘real’ atoms given reasonable coordinates if the the molecule is 2D or 3D. Writing in alias form, rather than the ‘real’ structure, requires the use of the -xA option. SVGFormat will also display any aliases present in a molecule if the -xA option is set.; The alias names that are recognized are in the file superatoms.txt which can be edited.; Normal molecules can have certain common groups given alternative alias representation using the --genalias option. The groups that are recognized and converted are a subset of those that are read. Displaying or writing them still requires the -xA option. For example, if aspirin.smi contained O=C(O)c1ccccc1OC(=O)C, it could be displayed with the aliases COOH and OAc by:; obabel aspirin.smi -O out.svg --genalias -xA. Forcefield energy and minimization#; Open Babel supports a number of forcefields which can be used for energy evaluation as well as energy minimization.

To evaluate a molecule’s energy using a forcefield, use the --energy option. The energy is put in an OBPairData object “Energy” which is accessible via an SDF or CML property or --append (to title). Use --ff <forcefield_id> to select a forcefield (default is Ghemical) and --log for a log of the energy calculation. The simplest way to output the energy is as follows:; obabel infile.xxx -otxt --energy --append ""Energy"". To perform forcefield minimization, the --minimize option is used. The following shows typical usage:; obabel infile.xxx -O outfile.yyy --minimize --steps 1500 --sd. The available options are as follows:; --log output a log of the minimization process (default= no log); --crit <converge> set convergence criteria (default=1e-6); --sd use steepest descent algorithm (default = conjugate gradient); --ne",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html:27465,avail,available,27465,docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Command-line_tools/babel.html,2,['avail'],['available']

Check out the latest development version:; git clone https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel.git openbabel-dev. This creates a directory called openbabel-dev, which contains the latest source code from Open Babel. Configure and compile this using CMake (see Compiling Open Babel).; After some time passes, and you want the latest bug fixes or new features, you may want to update your source code. To do this, go into the openbabel-dev directory you created above, and type:; git pull -u. Do step (2) again.; If, after updating, the compilation fails please report it to the Open Babel mailing list.

Availability,"s, and also on Windows (with Cygwin, MinGW or MSVC). Requirements#; To build Open Babel, you need the following:. The source code for the latest release of Open Babel; A C++ compiler. Open Babel is written in standards-compliant C++. The best-supported compilers are GCC 4 and MSVC++ 2008, but it also compiles with Clang and Intel Compiler 11. CMake 2.8 or newer. Open Babel uses CMake as its build system. CMake is an open source cross-platform build system from KitWare.; You need to install CMake 2.8 or newer. This is available as a binary package from the KitWare website; alternatively, it may be available through your package manager (on Linux). If necessary, you can also compile it yourself from the source code. If you want to build the GUI (Graphical User Interface), you need the following in addition:. wxWidgets 2.8 (or newer). Binary packages may be available through your package manager (wx-common, wx2.8-headers and libwxbase2.8-dev on Ubuntu) or from http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/. Otherwise, you could try compiling it yourself from the source code. The following are optional when compiling Open Babel, but if not available some features will be missing:. libxml2 development headers are required to read/write CML files and other XML formats (the libxml2-dev package in Ubuntu); zlib development libraries are required to support reading gzipped files (the zlib1g-dev package in Ubuntu); Eigen version 2 or newer is required if using the language bindings in the release. In addition, if it not present, some API classes (OBAlign, OBConformerSearch) and plugins (the QEq and QTPIE charge models, the --conformer and --align operations) will not be available.; Eigen may be available through your package manager (the libeigen2-dev package in Ubuntu). Alternatively, Eigen is available from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. It doesn’t need to be compiled or installed. Just unzip it and specify its location when configuring cmake (see below) using -DEIGEN2_INCLUDE_DIR=whereev",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html:3677,down,downloads,3677,docs/Installation/install.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html,2,['down'],['downloads']

This approach scales to the power of N, where N is the; number of rotatable bonds.; :obapi:`Fast Rotor Search <FastRotorSearch>`: This iterates through the; same conformer space as the; SystematicRotorSearch but it greedily optimises the torsion angle at each; rotatable bond in turn, starting from the most central. Thus it scales; linearly with the number of rotatable bonds.; :obapi:`Random Rotor Search <RandomRotorSearch>`: Conformations are; generated by randomly choosing from the allowed torsion angles.; :obapi:`Weighted Rotor Search <WeightedRotorSearch>`: This method uses an; iterative procedure to find a; global minimum. As with the Random Rotor Search, it randomly choses from; the allowed torsion angles but the choice is reweighted based on the energy; of the generated conformer. Over time, the generated conformer for each; step should become increasingly better. For each of these methods, the lowest energy conformation found is selected. In some cases, the entire set of conformations generated is also available. Many; of these methods include an option to optimize the geometry of conformations; during the search. This greatly slows down the procedure but may produce more; accurate results.; The choice of which algorithm to use depends on the speed/accuracy tradeoff with; which you are happy, and also on the number of rotatable bonds in the molecule.; Are you looking for a reasonable structure for 3D display? Or are you looking; for a structure close to the global minimum?; To use from obabel, see the help for the conformer operation (obabel -L conformer).

You can either install a binary package (the easiest option) or compile Open Babel yourself (also easy, but much more geek cred). Install a binary package#. Windows#; Open Babel is available as a binary installer for Windows, both 64-bit (preferred) or 32-bit (indicated by x86 in the filename). It includes several command-line tools as well as a graphical user interface (GUI). The latest version can be download from GitHub.; Advanced users may be interested in compiling Open Babel themselves (see Compiling Open Babel). Linux#; Open Babel binary packages are available from many Linux distributions including Ubuntu, OpenSUSE and Fedora.; In general, we recommend using the latest release of Open Babel (currently openbabel-3-1-1). If this is not available for your Linux distribution, you should compile Open Babel yourself. Compiling Open Babel#; Open Babel is written in C++. Compiling is the process of turning this C++ into instructions that the computer’s processor can understand, machine code.; Although pre-compiled (or “binary”) packages are available for several platforms, there are several reasons you might want to compile Open Babel yourself:.

Availability,"structure matching.; Unfortunately, substructure matching falls into a category of; “hard” mathematical problems, which means false positives from the; index are a big problem.; Substructure matching (finding a certain functional group within a; molecule) is an example of what mathematicians call; graph isomorphism,; and is in a class of problems called; NP Complete.; Roughly speaking, this means the time it takes to do a substructure; search is non-polynomial, i.e. exponential in the number of atoms; and bonds. To see why this is a computational disaster, compare two; tasks, one that takes polynomial time,; k1*N2, versus one that takes exponential; time k2*2N. Our polynomial task is bad; enough: If we double N, it takes four times as long to solve. But; the exponential task is worse:; Every time we add an atom it doubles. So going from one atom to; two doubles the time, and going from 100 atoms to 101 atoms doubles; the time. Even if we can get k2 down to a millionth of; k1, we’re still in trouble - a million is just; 220 or twenty atoms away.; It has been mathematically proven that substructure searching is in; the set of NP Complete problems, so there’s no point wasting our; time searching for a polynomial algorithm. The good news is that; most molecules have “low connectivity”, meaning most atoms have; fewer than four bonds, unlike the weird and twisted graphs that; mathematicians consider. In practice, most substructure matching; can be done in polynomial time around N2 or; N3. But even with this improvement, substructure; matching is an “expensive” time-consuming task for a computer.; The key point is that indexing is particularly important for; cheminformatics systems. The typical modern computer can only; examine a few thousand molecules per second, so examining millions; of molecules one-by-one is out of the question.

Substructure and similarity searching a large dataset#; Open Babel provides a format called the fs -- fastsearch index which should be used when searching large datasets (like ChEMBL) for molecules similar to a particular query. There are faster ways of searching (like using a chemical database) but FastSearch is convenient, and should give reasonable performance for most people.; To demonstrate similarity searching, we will use the first 1000 molecules in the latest release of ChEMBL:. Download the 2D SDF version of ChEMBL, chembl_nn.sdf.gz, from the ChEMBLdb download site and save in your Work folder. (Note: this is a gzipped file, but Open Babel will handle this without problems.); Set up an SDF to SDF conversion, set chembl_nn.sdf.gz as the input file and 1000_chembl.sdf as the output file.; Only convert the first 1000 molecules by entering 1000 in the box End import at molecule # specified. Click CONVERT. We can going to use the following structure for substructure and similarity searching. It can be represented by the SMILES string Nc1ccc(N)cc1. How the search works; Behind the scenes, the FastSearch index simply stores a path-based; binary fingerprint for each molecule. When used to search, similarity; is measured based on the Tanimoto coefficient. For exact search, hits; are verified by Open Babel’s graph isomorphism matcher.

The “electronic; surface” of the molecule is the important bit - the part that can; interact with other molecules. 3D searches compare the surfaces of; two molecules, and how polarized or polarizable each bit of the; surface is.; 3D similarity searches are uncommon, for two reasons: It’s; difficult and it’s slow. The difficulty comes from the complexity; of molecular interactions - a molecule is not a fixed shape, but; rather a dynamic object that changes according to its environment.; And the slowness comes from the difficulty: To get better results,; scientists employ more and more complex programs. Physical PropertiesThe above 2D and 3D similarity are based on the molecule’s; structure. Another technique compares the properties - either; computed or measured or both - and declares that molecules with; many properties in common are likely to have similar structure. It; is the idea of QSAR taken to the database. Clustering“Clustering” is the process of differentiating a set of things into; groups where each group has common features. Molecules can be; clustered using a variety of techniques, such as common 2D and/or; 3D features.; Note that clustering is not a similarity metric per se (the topic; of this section), but it may use various similarity metrics when; computing clusters. It is included here because it can be used as a; “cheap substitute”. That is, when someone wants to find compounds; similar to a known compound, you can show them the group (the; cluster) to which the compound belongs. It allows you to; pre-compute the clusters, spending lots of computational time up; front, and then give answers very quickly.

User Guide; Install Open Babel. Install Open Babel#; Open Babel runs on Windows, Linux and MacOSX. You can either install a binary package (the easiest option) or compile Open Babel yourself (also easy, but much more geek cred). Install a binary package#. Windows#; Open Babel is available as a binary installer for Windows, both 64-bit (preferred) or 32-bit (indicated by x86 in the filename). It includes several command-line tools as well as a graphical user interface (GUI). The latest version can be download from GitHub.; Advanced users may be interested in compiling Open Babel themselves (see Compiling Open Babel). Linux#; Open Babel binary packages are available from many Linux distributions including Ubuntu, OpenSUSE and Fedora.; In general, we recommend using the latest release of Open Babel (currently openbabel-3-1-1). If this is not available for your Linux distribution, you should compile Open Babel yourself. Compiling Open Babel#; Open Babel is written in C++. Compiling is the process of turning this C++ into instructions that the computer’s processor can understand, machine code.; Although pre-compiled (or “binary”) packages are available for several platforms, there are several reasons you might want to compile Open Babel yourself:. The current release (openbabel-3-1-1) of Open Babel is not available for your platform. We recommend always using the latest release.; You want more control over the features available. For example, perhaps you want the Python bindings but these were not included in your distribution.; You want to use the latest development code.; You want to add a new feature.

The default; options are to show the image on the screen (show=True), not to; write to a file (filename=None), to calculate 2D coordinates; (usecoords=False) but not to store them (update=False).; The addh(); and removeh(); methods allow hydrogens to be added and removed.; If a molecule does not have 3D coordinates, they can be generated; using the make3D(); method. By default, this includes 50 steps of a geometry; optimisation using the MMFF94 forcefield. The list of available; forcefields is stored in the; forcefields; variable. To further optimise the structure, you can use the; localopt(); method, which by default carries out 500 steps of an optimisation; using MMFF94. Note that hydrogens need to be added before calling; localopt().; The calcdesc(); method of a Molecule returns a dictionary containing descriptor; values for LogP, Polar Surface Area (“TPSA”) and Molar Refractivity; (“MR”). A list of the available descriptors is contained in the; variable descs.; If only one or two descriptor values are required, you can specify; the names as follows: calcdesc([""LogP"", ""TPSA""]). Since the; data attribute of a Molecule is also a dictionary, you can; easily add the result of calcdesc() to an SD file (for example); as follows:; mol = next(readfile(""sdf"", ""without_desc.sdf"")); descvalues = mol.calcdesc(); # In Python, the update method of a dictionary allows you; # to add the contents of one dictionary to another; mol.data.update(descvalues); output = Outputfile(""sdf"", ""with_desc.sdf""); output.write(mol); output.close(). For convenience, a Molecule provides an iterator over its Atoms.; This is used as follows:; for atom in myMolecule:; # do something with atom. Atoms have the following attributes: atomicmass, atomicnum,; coords, exactmass, formalcharge, heavyvalence,; heterovalence, hyb, idx, implicitvalence, isotope,; partialcharge, spin, type, valence, vector.

Deployability," As open source software, your code is read by many, many people.; Different contributions have often had different indentation styles. Simply making the code indentation consistent across an entire file makes the code easier to read.; The current accepted scheme for Open Babel is a default indent of two spaces, and use of spaces instead of tabs.; For tips on changing your editor to use this indentation style, please e-mail the openbabel-devel list. Delete code which is commented out. The SVN version control system maintains history, so if we need it later, we can go back and get that code. Dead code like this simply makes it harder to read the important code!; Marking areas of code which use :obapi:`OBAtom::GetIdx() <OpenBabel::OBAtom::GetIdx>` or other accesses to atom indexes, which may break when atom indexing changes. Code Maintenance#. Minimize #if/#endif conditional compilation. Some is required for portability, but these should be minimized where possible. If there seems to be some magic #define which accesses parts of the file, it’s probably dead code. As above, dead code makes it harder to maintain and read everything else.; Removing calls to cout, cerr, STDOUT, perror etc. These should use the global error reporting code.; Minimize warnings from compilers (e.g., GCC flags -Wextra -Wall). Sometimes these are innocuous, but it’s usually better to fix the problems before they become bugs.; Use static code analysis tools to find potential bugs in the code and remove them.; Insure proper use of atom and bond iterators, e.g., FOR_ATOMS_OF_MOL rather than atom or bond index access, which will break if indexing changes. Patches and contributions towards any of these tasks will be greatly appreciated. previous; Adding a new test. next; Adding plugins. On this page; .

Deployability," Babel library; C++. C++#. Quickstart example#; Here’s an example C++ program that uses the Open Babel toolkit to convert between two chemical file formats:; #include <iostream>; #include <openbabel/obconversion.h>; using namespace std;. int main(int argc,char **argv); {; if(argc<3); {; cout << ""Usage: ProgrameName InputFileName OutputFileName\n"";; return 1;; }. ifstream ifs(argv[1]);; if(!ifs); {; cout << ""Cannot open input file\n"";; return 1;; }; ofstream ofs(argv[2]);; if(!ofs); {; cout << ""Cannot open output file\n"";; return 1;; }; OpenBabel::OBConversion conv(&ifs, &ofs);; if(!conv.SetInAndOutFormats(""CML"",""MOL"")); {; cout << ""Formats not available\n"";; return 1;; }; int n = conv.Convert();; cout << n << "" molecules converted\n"";. return 0;; }. Next, we’ll look at how to compile this. How to compile against the Open Babel library#. Using Makefiles#; The following Makefile can be used to compile the above example, assuming that it’s saved as example.cpp. You need to have already installed Open Babel somewhere. If the include files or the library are not automatically found when running make, you can specify the location as shown by the commented out statements in CFLAGS and LDFLAGS below.; CC = g++; CFLAGS = -c # -I /home/user/Tools/openbabel/install/include/openbabel-2.0; LDFLAGS = -lopenbabel # -L /home/user/Tools/openbabel/install/lib. all: example. example: example.o; $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) example.o -o example. example.o: example.cpp; $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) example.cpp. clean:; rm -rf example.o example. Using CMake#; Rather than create a Makefile yourself, you can get CMake to do it for you. The nice thing about using CMake is that it can generate not only Makefiles, but also project files for MSVC++, KDevelop and Eclipse (among others). The following CMakeLists.txt can be used to generate any of these. The commented out lines can be used to specify the location of the Open Babel library and include files if necessary.; cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6); add",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/CppExamples.html:1952,install,installed,1952,docs/UseTheLibrary/CppExamples.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/CppExamples.html,2,['install'],['installed']

CSharp and OBDotNet#; OBDotNet is a compiled assembly that allows Open Babel to be used from the various .NET languages (e.g. Visual Basic, C#, IronPython, IronRuby, and J#) on Windows, Linux and MacOSX. The current version is OBDotNet 0.4. Installation#. Windows#; The OBDotNet.dll assembly provided on Windows was compiled using the .NET framework v3.5 for the x86 platform. To use it, you will need to compile your code using .NET v3.5 or newer and you will also need to target x86 (/platform:x86).; The following instructions describe how to compile a simple C# program that uses OBDotNet:. First you need to download and install the OpenBabelGUI version 2.3.2; Next create an example CSharp program that uses the Open Babel API (see below for one or use this link). Let’s call this example.cs.; Copy OBDotNet.dll from the Open Babel installation into the same folder as example.cs.; Open a command prompt at the location of example.cs and compile it as follows:; C:\Work> C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\csc.exe; /reference:OBDotNet.dll /platform:x86 example.cs. Run the created executable, example.exe, to discover the molecule weight of propane:; C:\Work> example.exe; 44.09562. If you prefer to use the MSVC# GUI, note that the Express edition does not have the option to choose x86 as a target. This will be a problem if you are using a 64-bit operating system. There’s some information at Coffee Driven Development on how to get around this. MacOSX and Linux#; On Linux and MacOSX you need to use Mono, the open source implementation of the .NET framework, to compile the bindings.

Deployability," Others do not.; Some programs specify all atoms. Others use “residues” or omit hydrogen atoms. Individual implementations of even standardized file formats are often buggy, incomplete or do not completely match published standards. As a free, and open source project, Open Babel improves by way of helping others. It gains by way of its users, contributors, developers, related projects, and the general chemical community. We must continually strive to support these constituencies.; We gratefully accept contributions in many forms – from bug reports, complaints, and critiques, which help us improve what we do poorly, to feature suggestions, code contributions, and other efforts, which direct our future development. For end users, we seek to provide a range of utility, from simple (or complex) file interconversion, to indexing, databasing, and transforming chemical and molecular data.; For developers, we seek to provide an easy-to-use free and open source chemical library. This assists a variety of chemical software, from molecular viewers and visualization tools and editors to databases, property prediction tools, and in-house development. To this end, we hope that our tools reflect several key points:. As much chemical information and files should be read and understood by Open Babel. This means that we should always strive to support as many concepts as possible in a given file format, and support for additional file formats is beneficial to the community as a whole.; Releases should be made to be “as good as we can make it” each and every time.; Improving our code and our community to bring in additional contributions in many forms helps both developers and end-users alike. Making development easy for new contributors will result in better tools for users as well. previous; Introduction. next; Frequently Asked Questions. ; ; ; Edit on GitHub; ; ; . ; © Copyright ©2023 The Open Babel Team.; .

Open Babel 1.99#; Released on 2002-1-29.; The Open Babel team is pleased to announce the release of Open Babel 1.99, a first beta release for the 2.0 version of the free, open-source replacement for the Babel chemistry file translation program.; At the moment, the beta release is not a drop-in replacement for babel as some file formats are not implemented and bond orders are not calculated for QM file formats.; Open Babel includes two components, a command-line utility and a C++ library. The command-line utility is intended to be used as a replacement for the original babel program, to translate between various chemical file formats. The C++ library includes all of the file-translation code as well as a wide variety of utilities to foster development of other open source chemistry software. previous; Open Babel 1.100.0. next; API. ; ; ; Edit on GitHub; ; ; . ; © Copyright ©2023 The Open Babel Team.; .

Deployability," an existing installation or you may want to avoid conflicts with a version of Open Babel installed by your package manager.; The solution to all of these problems is to do a local install into a directory somewhere in your home folder.; An additional advantage of a local install is that if you ever want to uninstall it, all you need to do is delete the installation directory; removing the files from a global install is more work. To configure cmake to install into ~/Tools/openbabel-install, for example, you would do the following:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools/openbabel-install. Then you can run make and make install without needing root access:; $ make && make install. Compile the GUI#; The GUI is built using the wxWidgets toolkit. Assuming that you have already installed this (see Requirements above), you just need to configure cmake as follows:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DBUILD_GUI=ON. When you run make and make install, the GUI will be automatically built and installed alongside the main Open Babel library and tools. Compile language bindings#. Eigen required; If you wish to compile the language bindings supplied in the release, Eigen version 2 or newer is required (see Requirements above). When configuring CMake, include options such as -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DRUBY_BINDINGS=ON for whichever bindings you wish to build (valid names are PYTHON, CSHARP, PERL, JAVA or RUBY) or -DALL_BINDINGS=ON to build them all. The bindings will then be built and installed along with the rest of Open Babel. You should note any warning messages in the CMake output.; If CMake cannot find Java, you should set the value of the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the directory containing the Java bin and lib directories. For example, if you download the JDK from Sun and run the self-extracting .bin file, it creates a directory jdk1.6.0_21 (or similar); you should set JAVA_HOME to the full path to this directory.; If CMake cannot find the Perl libraries (whic",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html:7905,install,install,7905,docs/Installation/install.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html,4,['install'],"['install', 'installed']"

Installation#. Windows#; openbabel.jar is installed along with the OpenBabelGUI on Windows, typically in C:/Program Files (x86)/OpenBabel-2.3.2. As an example of how to use openbabel.jar, download OBTest.java and compile and run it as follows:; C:\> set CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenBabel-2.3.2\openbabel.jar;.; C:\> ""C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_16\bin\javac.exe"" OBTest.java; C:\> ""C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_16\bin\java.exe"" OBTest; Running OBTest...; Benzene has 6 atoms.; C:\>. MacOSX and Linux#; The following instructions describe how to compile and use these bindings on MacOSX and Linux:. openbabel.jar is included in the Open Babel source distribution in scripts/java. To compile a Java application that uses this (e.g. the example program shown above), use a command similar to the following:; javac Test.java -cp ../openbabel-2.3.2/scripts/java/openbabel.jar. To run the resulting Test.class on MacOSX or Linux you first need to compile the Java bindings as described in the sectio",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/Java.html:3025,Install,Installation,3025,docs/UseTheLibrary/Java.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/Java.html,1,['Install'],['Installation']
Deployability," build. Now you need to run cmake to configure the build. The following will configure the build to use all of the default options:; $ cd build; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2. If you need to specify an option, use the -D switch to cmake. For example, the following line sets the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG. We will discuss various possible options later. At this point, it would be a good idea to compile Open Babel:; $ make. Have a coffee while the magic happens. If you have a multi-processor machine and would prefer an expresso, try a parallel build instead:; $ make -j4 # parallel build across 4 processors. And finally, as root (or using sudo) you should install it:; # make install. Local build#. Look Ma, no install!; With the right sort of environment variable magic (see below), you can actually use Open Babel straight from the build folder. But life is a bit easier if you install it somewhere, either system-wide or locally. By default, Open Babel is installed in /usr/local/ on a Unix-like system. This requires root access (or sudo). Even if you do have root access, you may not want to overwrite an existing installation or you may want to avoid conflicts with a version of Open Babel installed by your package manager.; The solution to all of these problems is to do a local install into a directory somewhere in your home folder.; An additional advantage of a local install is that if you ever want to uninstall it, all you need to do is delete the installation directory; removing the files from a global install is more work.

Deployability," code contributed by a wide variety of developers (see Thanks). This section describes some general guidelines and “best practices” for code developers. Developer Resources#; For new and existing developers here are some useful resources:. GitHub project page; Development version API documentation; Development version Sphinx documentation. Working with the Development Code#; To download and update the latest version of the Open Babel source code, you need Git. Git is the name of the project used to maintain the Open Babel version control repository. There are many clients for Git, including command-line and GUI applications. Keeping up to date with Git#. Check out the latest development version:; git clone https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel.git openbabel-dev. This creates a directory called openbabel-dev, which contains the latest source code from Open Babel. Configure and compile this using CMake (see Compiling Open Babel).; After some time passes, and you want the latest bug fixes or new features, you may want to update your source code. To do this, go into the openbabel-dev directory you created above, and type:; git pull -u. Do step (2) again.; If, after updating, the compilation fails please report it to the Open Babel mailing list. In the meanwhile, if you want to go back to a particular revision (that is, if you don’t want to use the latest one), just use git log to find the checksum of the current revision, and update to an earlier revision using this:. $ git log; …; commit 1c2916cc5e6ed31a23291524b08291c904506c3f; Author: Noel O’Boyle <baoilleach@gmail.com>; Date: Mon Apr 30 07:33:17 2018 +0100; $ git checkout 1c2916cc5. Modular design of code base#; Since version 2.0, Open Babel has had a modular structure.

Deployability," is a non-standard format); obAuditMsg – for messages auditing methods which destroy or perceive molecular data (e.g., kekulization, atom typing, etc.); obDebug – for messages only useful for debugging purposes. The default filter level is set to obWarning, which means that users are told of critical errors, but not non-standard formatting of input files.; A global error handler :obapi:`obErrorLog` (an instance of :obapi:`OBMessageHandler`) is defined and should be used as shown in the API documentation for the :obapi:`OBMessageHandler` class. Lazy Evaluation#; The :obapi:`OBMol::BeginModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::BeginModify>` and :obapi:`OBMol::EndModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::EndModify>` calls are part of Open Babel’s lazy evaluation mechanism.; In some cases, code may desire to make a large number of changes to an OBMol object at once. Ideally, this should all happen without triggering unintended perception routines. Therefore, the BeginModify() call marks the beginning of such code, and EndModify() triggers any needed updates of lazy evaluation methods.; For example:; mol.BeginModify();; double x,y,z;; OBAtom *atom;; vector<string> vs;. for (i = 1; i <= natoms; i ++); {; if (!ifs.getline(buffer,BUFF_SIZE)); return(false);; tokenize(vs,buffer);; if (vs.size() != 4); return(false);. atom = mol.NewAtom();; x = atof((char*)vs[1].c_str());; y = atof((char*)vs[2].c_str());; z = atof((char*)vs[3].c_str());. atom->SetVector(x,y,z); //set coordinates; atom->SetAtomicNum(atoi(vs[0].c_str())); // set atomic number; }; mol.ConnectTheDots();; mol.PerceiveBondOrders();; mol.EndModify();. This code reads in a list of atoms with XYZ coordinates and the atomic number in the first column (vs[0]). Since hundreds or thousands of atoms could be added to a molecule, followed by creating bonds, the code is enclosed in a BeginModify()/EndModify() pair. previous; Overview. next; Documentation.

The contents of this object will be different depending on the specific type of stereochemistry, e.g. OBCisTransStereo::Config (OBCisTransConfig from Python) records the begin and end Ids of the associated bond, the Ids of the attached atoms, the spatial relationship of those atoms, and whether stereo is specified.; Let’s read the SMILES string F[C@@](Cl)(Br)I and access the stereo.

Deployability," the atom Ids are arranged clockwise? From the documentation for OBTetrahedralStereo::GetConfig, which states that this is the default. You may be used to thinking “How are these atoms arranged looking from here?”. With GetConfig(), you are instead making the request “Give me the atoms in clockwise order looking from here”. It follows from this that you should never need to test the value of the winding, the direction, or the from/towards atom; you provide these, and their values will be whatever you provided. For example, you could instead ask for the anticlockwise arrangement of atoms looking towards the atom with Id 0:; configB = tetstereo.GetConfig(0, ob.OBStereo.AntiClockwise, ob.OBStereo.ViewTowards); print(""Looking towards atom Id {0}, the atoms Ids {1} are arranged anticlockwise"".format(config.from_or_towards, config.refs)). Which prints:; Looking towards atom Id 0, the atoms Ids (2, 3, 4) are arranged anticlockwise. To check whether two Configs represent the same stereo configuration, use the equality operator:; assert config == configB. It should be noted that the Config objects returned by GetConfig() are copies of the stereo configuration. That is, modifying them has no affect on the stereochemistry of the molecule (see the next section). As a result, it is straightforward to keep a copy of the stereo configuration, modify the molecule, and then check whether the modification has altered the stereochemistry using the equality operator of the Config. Modifying the stereochemistry#; We discuss below the interaction between 2D and 3D structural information and how stereochemistry is perceived. For now, let’s avoid these issues by using a 0D structure and modifying its stereochemistry:; from openbabel import pybel; ob = pybel.ob. mol = pybel.readstring(""smi"", ""C[C@@H](Cl)F""); print(mol.write(""smi"", opt={""nonewline"": True})). # Invert the stereo; m = mol.OBMol; facade = ob.OBStereoFacade(m); tetstereo = facade.GetTetrahedralStereo(m.GetAtom(2).GetId()); confi",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:6963,configurat,configuration,6963,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,2,['configurat'],['configuration']
Deployability," the following line sets the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG. We will discuss various possible options later. At this point, it would be a good idea to compile Open Babel:; $ make. Have a coffee while the magic happens. If you have a multi-processor machine and would prefer an expresso, try a parallel build instead:; $ make -j4 # parallel build across 4 processors. And finally, as root (or using sudo) you should install it:; # make install. Local build#. Look Ma, no install!; With the right sort of environment variable magic (see below), you can actually use Open Babel straight from the build folder. But life is a bit easier if you install it somewhere, either system-wide or locally. By default, Open Babel is installed in /usr/local/ on a Unix-like system. This requires root access (or sudo). Even if you do have root access, you may not want to overwrite an existing installation or you may want to avoid conflicts with a version of Open Babel installed by your package manager.; The solution to all of these problems is to do a local install into a directory somewhere in your home folder.; An additional advantage of a local install is that if you ever want to uninstall it, all you need to do is delete the installation directory; removing the files from a global install is more work. To configure cmake to install into ~/Tools/openbabel-install, for example, you would do the following:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools/openbabel-install. Then you can run make and make install without needing root access:; $ make && make install. Compile the GUI#; The GUI is built using the wxWidgets toolkit.

Deployability," to you. Isn’t that why many of us went into science?; Once licensed under the GPL, the code must remain free to interested parties. If someone modifies it, that code must still remain under the GPL, free for all.; What’s in it for an open-source software project?; Certainly the answers for closed-source software and academics also apply for you. Beyond that, if your code is compatible with the GPL, you can directly use Open Babel and all of the API. This is already happening with the Avogadro molecular editor, available under the GPL, and many others (see related projects). There’s a lot of code in Open Babel beyond file translation and more to come. Why reinvent the wheel?; Why is this covered under the GPL instead of license X?; The short answer is that OpenEye Scientific Software employs Matt Stahl, one of the authors of the original Babel. They released a library called OELib under the GPL that did many things that Babel did. Later they decided to release the next version of OELib as a closed-source project–their choice for their code. We took the version of OELib still under GPL and went from there.; If you’d like to see Open Babel licensed differently, we’d suggest asking OpenEye if they’d consider releasing the old code under a new license, e.g. the LGPL. At that point, we’d consider whether Open Babel should be relicensed or not.

Deployability," wide variety of utilities to foster development of other open source scientific software.; How does this relate to BabelChat, BabelFish, Babel IM, etc. …?; It doesn’t. Not surprisingly, “babel” is used frequently in a lot of software names.; Is it Open Babel or OpenBabel?; Your choice. It’s probably easier to call it Open Babel since that’s what it is–an open version of Babel. But if you like one-word, mixed-case project names, then go for OpenBabel. In that case, the space is just too small to be printed.; How does this relate to the original Babel and OELib, the “next” Babel?; The original Babel was written by Pat Walters and Matt Stahl, based on the “convert” program by Ajay Shah, and is still a remarkable application. Both Pat and Matt have moved on to other work. The original Babel is hosted by Smog.com on a Babel homepage, by the Computational Chemistry List (CCL) and of course by Open Babel at SourceForge.net.; Along the way, the two original authors started a rewrite of Babel into C++ they called OBabel, which was never really publicly released. But Matt used some of these ideas in OELib, which was generously released under the GNU GPL by his employer, OpenEye Software, and the last known version of this OELib is still available from our file repository.; OpenEye decided that for their purposes OELib needed a rewrite (now called OEChem), but this would be closed-source to include some advanced algorithms. So the GPL’ed version of OELib would not be maintained. Instead, the free version of OELib was renamed and has become “Open Babel” with the blessing of Matt and other contributors.; Open Babel has evolved quite a lot since its birth in 2001.; What’s the latest version?; As of this writing, the latest version is Open Babel openbabel-3-1-1. This is a stable version suitable for widespread use and development.; Can I use Open Babel code in a personal project?; One common misconception about the GNU GPL license for Open Babel is that it requires users to releas",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Introduction/faq.html:2692,release,released,2692,docs/Introduction/faq.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Introduction/faq.html,2,['release'],['released']
Deployability," your agreement. Fellow academics can use it directly, learn from it, improve it and contribute back to you. Isn’t that why many of us went into science?; Once licensed under the GPL, the code must remain free to interested parties. If someone modifies it, that code must still remain under the GPL, free for all.; What’s in it for an open-source software project?; Certainly the answers for closed-source software and academics also apply for you. Beyond that, if your code is compatible with the GPL, you can directly use Open Babel and all of the API. This is already happening with the Avogadro molecular editor, available under the GPL, and many others (see related projects). There’s a lot of code in Open Babel beyond file translation and more to come. Why reinvent the wheel?; Why is this covered under the GPL instead of license X?; The short answer is that OpenEye Scientific Software employs Matt Stahl, one of the authors of the original Babel. They released a library called OELib under the GPL that did many things that Babel did. Later they decided to release the next version of OELib as a closed-source project–their choice for their code. We took the version of OELib still under GPL and went from there.; If you’d like to see Open Babel licensed differently, we’d suggest asking OpenEye if they’d consider releasing the old code under a new license, e.g. the LGPL. At that point, we’d consider whether Open Babel should be relicensed or not. Obviously all copyright holders must agree to the new license.; It’s worth noting that since OpenEye is developing a closed-source library called OEChem and implies one reason for purchase is in closed-source development products. So we think it’s highly unlikely that OpenEye would allow Open Babel to become a competitor by relicensing under the LGPL.; Where can I read more about the GNU GPL?; The Free Software Foundation maintains a FAQ list about the GNU GPL.

Deployability,"#; Chemical Registration is the “big brother” of cheminformatics.; A cheminformatics system is primarily devoted to recording chemical; structure. Chemical Registration systems are additionally concerned; with:. Structural novelty - ensure that each compound is only; registered once; Structural normalization - ensure that structures with; alternative representations (such as nitro groups, ferrocenes, and; tautomers) are entered in a uniform way.; Structure drawing - ensure that compounds are drawn in a uniform; fashion, so that they can be quickly recognized “by eye”.; Maintaining relationships among related compounds. For example,; all salt forms of a compound should be recognized as being related; to one another, and compounds in different solvates are also; related.; Registering mixtures, formulations and alternative structures.; Registering compounds the structure of which is unknown.; Roles, responsibilities, security, and company workflow.; Updates, amendments and corrections, and controlling propagation; of changes (e.g. does changing a compound change a mixture; containing that compound?). The scope of Chemical Registration Systems is far beyond the goals; of this brief introduction to cheminformatics.

Instead, the free version of OELib was renamed and has become “Open Babel” with the blessing of Matt and other contributors.; Open Babel has evolved quite a lot since its birth in 2001.; What’s the latest version?; As of this writing, the latest version is Open Babel openbabel-3-1-1. This is a stable version suitable for widespread use and development.; Can I use Open Babel code in a personal project?; One common misconception about the GNU GPL license for Open Babel is that it requires users to release any code that uses the Open Babel library. This is completely untrue. There are no restrictions on use of Open Babel code for personal projects, regardless of where you work (academia, industry, … wherever).; However, if you intend on releasing a software package that uses Open Babel code, the GPL requires that your package be released under the GNU GPL license. The distinction is between use and distribution. See What’s in it for me to contribute? below for more on the licensing issues.; How do I cite Open Babel in a paper?; To support development of Open Babel, please cite:. Hutchison et al. [obj2011]. [obj2011]; Noel M. O’Boyle, Michael Banck, Craig A. James, Chris Morley, Tim Vandermeersch, Geoffrey R. Hutchison; Open Babel: An open chemical toolbox.; J. Cheminf. 2011, 3, 33.; [Link].

Deployability,". Additionally, if you have not installed Open Babel globally you should set BABEL_LIBDIR to the location of the Open Babel library and BABEL_DATADIR to the data directory.; Now, run the example application. The output should be as shown above. API#; openbabel.jar provides direct access to the C++ Open Babel library from Java through the namespace org.openbabel. This binding is generated using the SWIG package and provides access to almost all of the Open Babel interfaces from Java, including the base classes :obapi:`OBMol`, :obapi:`OBAtom`, :obapi:`OBBond`, and :obapi:`OBResidue`, as well as the conversion framework :obapi:`OBConversion`.; Essentially any call in the C++ API is available to Java programs with very little difference in syntax. As a result, the principal documentation is the Open Babel C++ API documentation. A few differences exist, however:. Global variables, global functions and constants in the C++ API can be found in org.openbabel.openbabel_java. The variables are accessible through get methods.; When accessing various types of :obapi:`OBGenericData`, you will need to cast them to the particular subclass using the global functions, toPairData, toUnitCell, etc.; The Java versions of the iterator classes in the C++ API (that is, all those classes ending in Iter) implement the Iterator and Iterable interfaces. This means that the following foreach loop is possible:; for(OBAtom atom : new OBMolAtomIter(mol)) {; System.out.println(atom.GetAtomicNum());; }. To facilitate use of the :obapi:`OBMolAtomBFSIter`, OBAtom has been extended to incorporate a CurrentDepth value, accessible through a get method:; for(OBAtom atom : new OBMolAtomBFSIter(mol)) {; System.out.println(atom.GetCurrentDepth());; }. previous; Examples. next; Perl.

Deployability,". We recommend always using the latest release.; You want more control over the features available. For example, perhaps you want the Python bindings but these were not included in your distribution.; You want to use the latest development code.; You want to add a new feature. It is easy to add new formats or operations to Open Babel as it has a plugin architecture (see Adding plugins).; You just want to compile stuff yourself. We understand. Open Babel can be compiled on Linux, MacOSX, BSDs and other Unixes, and also on Windows (with Cygwin, MinGW or MSVC). Requirements#; To build Open Babel, you need the following:. The source code for the latest release of Open Babel; A C++ compiler. Open Babel is written in standards-compliant C++. The best-supported compilers are GCC 4 and MSVC++ 2008, but it also compiles with Clang and Intel Compiler 11. CMake 2.8 or newer. Open Babel uses CMake as its build system. CMake is an open source cross-platform build system from KitWare.; You need to install CMake 2.8 or newer. This is available as a binary package from the KitWare website; alternatively, it may be available through your package manager (on Linux). If necessary, you can also compile it yourself from the source code. If you want to build the GUI (Graphical User Interface), you need the following in addition:. wxWidgets 2.8 (or newer). Binary packages may be available through your package manager (wx-common, wx2.8-headers and libwxbase2.8-dev on Ubuntu) or from http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/. Otherwise, you could try compiling it yourself from the source code. The following are optional when compiling Open Babel, but if not available some features will be missing:. libxml2 development headers are required to read/write CML files and other XML formats (the libxml2-dev package in Ubuntu); zlib development libraries are required to support reading gzipped files (the zlib1g-dev package in Ubuntu); Eigen version 2 or newer is required if using the language bindings in",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html:3167,install,install,3167,docs/Installation/install.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html,2,['install'],['install']

Deployability,"; If CMake cannot find Java, you should set the value of the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the directory containing the Java bin and lib directories. For example, if you download the JDK from Sun and run the self-extracting .bin file, it creates a directory jdk1.6.0_21 (or similar); you should set JAVA_HOME to the full path to this directory.; If CMake cannot find the Perl libraries (which happens on Ubuntu 10.10, surprisingly), you need to configure CMake with something like -DPERL_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libperl.so.5.10 -DPERL_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/lib/perl/5.10.1/CORE.; If you are compiling the CSharp bindings, you should specify the CSharp compiler to use with something like -DCSHARP_EXECUTABLE=C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\csc.exe.; When you run make install, all of the bindings will be installed to the same location as the Open Babel libraries (typically /usr/local/lib).; To prepare to use the bindings, add the install directory to the front of the appropriate environment variable: PYTHONPATH for Python, PERL5LIB for Perl, RUBYLIB for Ruby, CLASSPATH for Java, and MONO_PATH for Mono. For example, for Python:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON; $ make; # make install; $ export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib:$PYTHONPATH. Cygwin#; The basic build instructions up above work just fine so long as you use the CMake provided by Cygwin rather than a native Windows installation.; If you get an error about undefined reference to '_xmlFreeTextReader', you need to specify the location of the XML libraries with the -DLIBXML2_LIBRARIES option:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DLIBXML2_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/libxml2.dll.a. The language bindings don’t seem to work under Cygwin. If you can get them to work, let us know. Also remember that anything that uses Cygwin runs slower than a native build using MinGW or MSVC++, so if speed is an issue you might prefer to compile with MinGW or MSVC++.

Deployability,"C:\>. MacOSX and Linux#; The following instructions describe how to compile and use these bindings on MacOSX and Linux:. openbabel.jar is included in the Open Babel source distribution in scripts/java. To compile a Java application that uses this (e.g. the example program shown above), use a command similar to the following:; javac Test.java -cp ../openbabel-2.3.2/scripts/java/openbabel.jar. To run the resulting Test.class on MacOSX or Linux you first need to compile the Java bindings as described in the section Compile language bindings. This creates lib/libopenbabel_java.so in the build directory.; Add the location of openbabel.jar to the environment variable CLASSPATH, not forgetting to append the location of Test.class (typically “.”):; export CLASSPATH=/home/user/Tools/openbabel-2.3.2/scripts/java/openbabel.jar:. Add the location of libopenbabel_java.so to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Additionally, if you have not installed Open Babel globally you should set BABEL_LIBDIR to the location of the Open Babel library and BABEL_DATADIR to the data directory.; Now, run the example application. The output should be as shown above. API#; openbabel.jar provides direct access to the C++ Open Babel library from Java through the namespace org.openbabel. This binding is generated using the SWIG package and provides access to almost all of the Open Babel interfaces from Java, including the base classes :obapi:`OBMol`, :obapi:`OBAtom`, :obapi:`OBBond`, and :obapi:`OBResidue`, as well as the conversion framework :obapi:`OBConversion`.; Essentially any call in the C++ API is available to Java programs with very little difference in syntax. As a result, the principal documentation is the Open Babel C++ API documentation. A few differences exist, however:.

Deployability,"ILD_TYPE=DEBUG. We will discuss various possible options later. At this point, it would be a good idea to compile Open Babel:; $ make. Have a coffee while the magic happens. If you have a multi-processor machine and would prefer an expresso, try a parallel build instead:; $ make -j4 # parallel build across 4 processors. And finally, as root (or using sudo) you should install it:; # make install. Local build#. Look Ma, no install!; With the right sort of environment variable magic (see below), you can actually use Open Babel straight from the build folder. But life is a bit easier if you install it somewhere, either system-wide or locally. By default, Open Babel is installed in /usr/local/ on a Unix-like system. This requires root access (or sudo). Even if you do have root access, you may not want to overwrite an existing installation or you may want to avoid conflicts with a version of Open Babel installed by your package manager.; The solution to all of these problems is to do a local install into a directory somewhere in your home folder.; An additional advantage of a local install is that if you ever want to uninstall it, all you need to do is delete the installation directory; removing the files from a global install is more work. To configure cmake to install into ~/Tools/openbabel-install, for example, you would do the following:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools/openbabel-install. Then you can run make and make install without needing root access:; $ make && make install. Compile the GUI#; The GUI is built using the wxWidgets toolkit. Assuming that you have already installed this (see Requirements above), you just need to configure cmake as follows:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DBUILD_GUI=ON. When you run make and make install, the GUI will be automatically built and installed alongside the main Open Babel library and tools. Compile language bindings#.

They keep thinking of new file formats.; Indeed, these are not just simple differences in how chemical; data is stored, but often completely different views on molecular; representations. For example, some file formats ignore hydrogen atoms; as “implicit,” while others do not store bonding information. This is,; in fact, a key reason for Open Babel’s existence.; OpenBabel has support for 146 formats in total. It can read 108 formats and can write 107 formats. These formats are identified by a name (for example, ShelX format) and one or more short codes (in this case, ins or res). The titles of each section provide this information (for example, ShelX format (ins, res)).; The short code is used when using obabel or babel to convert files from one format to another:; obabel -iins myfile.ins -ocml. converts from ShelX format to Chemical Markup Language (in this case, ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/FileFormats/Overview.html:1238,Release,Release,1238,docs/FileFormats/Overview.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/FileFormats/Overview.html,1,['Release'],['Release']

User Guide; Write software using the Open Babel library; The Open Babel API. The Open Babel API#; The API (Application Programming Interface) is the set of classes, methods and variables that a programming library provides to the user. The Open Babel API is implemented in C++, but the same set of classes, methods and variables are accessed through the various language bindings.; The API documentation is automatically generated from the source code using the Doxygen tool. The following links point to the various versions of the documentation:. API for the current release; API for the development version (updated nightly, with error report showing errors in documentation); API for specific versions: 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3. The Open Babel toolkit uses a version numbering that indicates how the API has changed over time:. Bug fix releases (e.g., 2.0.0, vs. 2.0.1) do not change API at all.; Minor versions (e.g., 2.0 vs. 2.1) will add function calls, but will be otherwise backwards-compatible.; Major versions (e.g. 2 vs 3) are not backwards-compatible, and have changes in the API. Overall, our goal is for the Open Babel API to remain stable over as long a period as possible. This means that users can be confident that their code will continue to work despite the release of new versions with additional features, file formats and bug fixes. For example, at the time of writing we have been on the version 2 series for almost five years (since November 2005).

Otherwise, you could try compiling it yourself from the source code. The following are optional when compiling Open Babel, but if not available some features will be missing:. libxml2 development headers are required to read/write CML files and other XML formats (the libxml2-dev package in Ubuntu); zlib development libraries are required to support reading gzipped files (the zlib1g-dev package in Ubuntu); Eigen version 2 or newer is required if using the language bindings in the release. In addition, if it not present, some API classes (OBAlign, OBConformerSearch) and plugins (the QEq and QTPIE charge models, the --conformer and --align operations) will not be available.; Eigen may be available through your package manager (the libeigen2-dev package in Ubuntu). Alternatively, Eigen is available from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. It doesn’t need to be compiled or installed. Just unzip it and specify its location when configuring cmake (see below) using -DEIGEN2_INCLUDE_DIR=whereever or -DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=wherever. Cairo development libraries are required to support PNG depiction (the libcairo2-dev package in Ubuntu); If using GCC 3.x to compile (and not GCC 4.x), then the Boost headers are required for certain formats (CML, Chemkin, Chemdraw CDX, MDL RXN and RSMI). If you want to use Open Babel using one of the supported language bindings, then the following notes may apply:. You need the the Python development libraries to compile the Python bindings (package python-dev in Ubuntu); You need the the Perl development libraries to compile the Perl bindings (package libperl-dev in Ubuntu).

The latest version can be download from GitHub.; Advanced users may be interested in compiling Open Babel themselves (see Compiling Open Babel). Linux#; Open Babel binary packages are available from many Linux distributions including Ubuntu, OpenSUSE and Fedora.; In general, we recommend using the latest release of Open Babel (currently openbabel-3-1-1). If this is not available for your Linux distribution, you should compile Open Babel yourself. Compiling Open Babel#; Open Babel is written in C++. Compiling is the process of turning this C++ into instructions that the computer’s processor can understand, machine code.; Although pre-compiled (or “binary”) packages are available for several platforms, there are several reasons you might want to compile Open Babel yourself:. The current release (openbabel-3-1-1) of Open Babel is not available for your platform. We recommend always using the latest release.; You want more control over the features available. For example, perhaps you want the Python bindings but these were not included in your distribution.; You want to use the latest development code.; You want to add a new feature. It is easy to add new formats or operations to Open Babel as it has a plugin architecture (see Adding plugins).; You just want to compile stuff yourself. We understand. Open Babel can be compiled on Linux, MacOSX, BSDs and other Unixes, and also on Windows (with Cygwin, MinGW or MSVC). Requirements#; To build Open Babel, you need the following:. The source code for the latest release of Open Babel; A C++ compiler. Open Babel is written in standards-compliant C++. The best-supported compilers are GCC 4 and MSVC++ 2008, but it also compiles with Clang and Intel Compiler 11. CMake 2.8 or newer. Open Babel uses CMake as its build system.

The language bindings don’t seem to work under Cygwin. If you can get them to work, let us know. Also remember that anything that uses Cygwin runs slower than a native build using MinGW or MSVC++, so if speed is an issue you might prefer to compile with MinGW or MSVC++. MinGW#; Open Babel builds out of the box with MinGW. It’s an awkward system to set up though, so here are some step-by-step instructions…TODO. Windows (MSVC)#; The main Windows build used by Open Babel uses the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (MSVC). Set up the following environment variables:. Add the CMake bin directory to the PATH.; (Optional, see Requirements above) Set EIGEN2_INCLUDE_DIR to the location of the top level Eigen directory (if installed).; (Optional, required for GUI) Set WXWIN to the top level directory of wxWidgets (if installed). Install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 (or newer) compiler.; We use the Visual C++ 2010 (10.0) Express Edition (available for free). Open a command prompt, and change directory to the windows-vc2008 subdirectory. To configure cmake, and generate the VC++ project files, run default_build.bat.; Double-click on windows-vc2008/build/openbabel.sln to start MSVC++. At the top of the window just below the menu bar, choose Release in the drop-down box.; On the left-hand side, right-click on the ALL_BUILD target, and choose Build. Troubleshooting build problems#; CMake caches some variables from run-to-run. How can I wipe the cache to start from scratch?; Delete CMakeCache.txt in the build directory. This is also a very useful file to look into if you have any problems.; How do I specify the location of the XML libraries?; CMake should find these automatically if they are installed system-wide.

It also removes deprecated components and breaks the API in a few places. For information on migrating from the previous version, please see Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x. Notable changes#. The babel program has been removed, and the replacement obabel should be used instead. The obabel program fixes some flaws with the original babel (not least that the user could accidentally overwrite an input file) and so has been preferred for many years.; The Python bindings are now accessed via “from openbabel import pybel” or “from openbabel import openbabel”.; Under the hood, the code for handling implicit hydrogens and kekulization has been entirely replaced in order to address problems with the original approach that had resulted in multiple bug reports over the years. As well as being accurate, the new approach is much faster.; The s",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/ReleaseNotes/ob300.html:1249,release,release,1249,docs/ReleaseNotes/ob300.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/ReleaseNotes/ob300.html,2,['release'],['release']

It is somewhat like searching for “221b Baker Street” and finding; nothing because the database contains “221B Baker Street” and the; system doesn’t consider “b” and “B” a match.; A good similarity search would find the target structure shown; above, because even though it is not a substructure match, it is; highly similar to our query.; There are many ways to measure similarity. 2D topologyThe best-known and most widely used similarity metrics compare the; two-dimensional topology, that is, they only use the molecule’s; atoms and bonds without considering its shape.; Tanimoto similarity is perhaps the best known as it is easy to; implement and fast to compute. An excellent summary of 2D; similarity metrics can be found in section 5.3 of the; Daylight Theory Manual. 3D configurationOne of the most important uses of similarity is in the discovery of; new drugs, and a molecule’s shape is critical to it’s medicinal; value (see QSAR).; 3D similarity searches compare the configuration (also called the; “conformation”) of a molecule to other molecules. The “electronic; surface” of the molecule is the important bit - the part that can; interact with other molecules. 3D searches compare the surfaces of; two molecules, and how polarized or polarizable each bit of the; surface is.; 3D similarity searches are uncommon, for two reasons: It’s; difficult and it’s slow. The difficulty comes from the complexity; of molecular interactions - a molecule is not a fixed shape, but; rather a dynamic object that changes according to its environment.; And the slowness comes from the difficulty: To get better results,; scientists employ more and more complex programs. Physical PropertiesThe above 2D and 3D similarity are based on the molecule’s; structure.

The default; options are to show the image on the screen (show=True), not to; write to a file (filename=None), to calculate 2D coordinates; (usecoords=False) but not to store them (update=False).; The addh(); and removeh(); methods allow hydrogens to be added and removed.; If a molecule does not have 3D coordinates, they can be generated; using the make3D(); method. By default, this includes 50 steps of a geometry; optimisation using the MMFF94 forcefield. The list of available; forcefields is stored in the; forcefields; variable. To further optimise the structure, you can use the; localopt(); method, which by default carries out 500 steps of an optimisation; using MMFF94. Note that hydrogens need to be added before calling; localopt().; The calcdesc(); method of a Molecule returns a dictionary containing descriptor; values for LogP, Polar Surface Area (“TPSA”) and Molar Refractivity; (“MR”).

Deployability,"d#. Look Ma, no install!; With the right sort of environment variable magic (see below), you can actually use Open Babel straight from the build folder. But life is a bit easier if you install it somewhere, either system-wide or locally. By default, Open Babel is installed in /usr/local/ on a Unix-like system. This requires root access (or sudo). Even if you do have root access, you may not want to overwrite an existing installation or you may want to avoid conflicts with a version of Open Babel installed by your package manager.; The solution to all of these problems is to do a local install into a directory somewhere in your home folder.; An additional advantage of a local install is that if you ever want to uninstall it, all you need to do is delete the installation directory; removing the files from a global install is more work. To configure cmake to install into ~/Tools/openbabel-install, for example, you would do the following:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools/openbabel-install. Then you can run make and make install without needing root access:; $ make && make install. Compile the GUI#; The GUI is built using the wxWidgets toolkit. Assuming that you have already installed this (see Requirements above), you just need to configure cmake as follows:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DBUILD_GUI=ON. When you run make and make install, the GUI will be automatically built and installed alongside the main Open Babel library and tools. Compile language bindings#. Eigen required; If you wish to compile the language bindings supplied in the release, Eigen version 2 or newer is required (see Requirements above). When configuring CMake, include options such as -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DRUBY_BINDINGS=ON for whichever bindings you wish to build (valid names are PYTHON, CSHARP, PERL, JAVA or RUBY) or -DALL_BINDINGS=ON to build them all. The bindings will then be built and installed along with the rest of Open Babel.

Deployability,"do a local install into a directory somewhere in your home folder.; An additional advantage of a local install is that if you ever want to uninstall it, all you need to do is delete the installation directory; removing the files from a global install is more work. To configure cmake to install into ~/Tools/openbabel-install, for example, you would do the following:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools/openbabel-install. Then you can run make and make install without needing root access:; $ make && make install. Compile the GUI#; The GUI is built using the wxWidgets toolkit. Assuming that you have already installed this (see Requirements above), you just need to configure cmake as follows:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DBUILD_GUI=ON. When you run make and make install, the GUI will be automatically built and installed alongside the main Open Babel library and tools. Compile language bindings#. Eigen required; If you wish to compile the language bindings supplied in the release, Eigen version 2 or newer is required (see Requirements above). When configuring CMake, include options such as -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DRUBY_BINDINGS=ON for whichever bindings you wish to build (valid names are PYTHON, CSHARP, PERL, JAVA or RUBY) or -DALL_BINDINGS=ON to build them all. The bindings will then be built and installed along with the rest of Open Babel. You should note any warning messages in the CMake output.; If CMake cannot find Java, you should set the value of the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the directory containing the Java bin and lib directories. For example, if you download the JDK from Sun and run the self-extracting .bin file, it creates a directory jdk1.6.0_21 (or similar); you should set JAVA_HOME to the full path to this directory.; If CMake cannot find the Perl libraries (which happens on Ubuntu 10.10, surprisingly), you need to configure CMake with something like -DPERL_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libperl.so.5.10 -DPERL_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/lib/perl/5.10.1",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html:8118,release,release,8118,docs/Installation/install.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html,2,['release'],['release']

It fixes some long-standing issues affecting performance in terms of chemical accuracy and speed, and all users are recommended to upgrade. It also removes deprecated components and breaks the API in a few places. For information on migrating from the previous version, please see Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x. Notable changes#. The babel program has been removed, and the replacement obabel should be used instead. The obabel program fixes some flaws with the original babel (not least that the user could accidentally overwrite an input file) and so has been preferred for many years.; The Python bindings are now accessed via “from openbabel import pybel” or “from openbabel import openbabel”.; Under the hood, the code for handling implicit hydrogens and kekulization has been entirely replaced in order to address problems with the original approach that had resulted in multiple bug reports over the years. As well as being accurate, the new approach is much faster.; The speed of reading and writing SMILES has been improved by more than 50-fold.; A faste",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/ReleaseNotes/ob300.html:1389,upgrade,upgrade,1389,docs/ReleaseNotes/ob300.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/ReleaseNotes/ob300.html,2,['upgrade'],['upgrade']

Using CMake#; Rather than create a Makefile yourself, you can get CMake to do it for you. The nice thing about using CMake is that it can generate not only Makefiles, but also project files for MSVC++, KDevelop and Eclipse (among others). The following CMakeLists.txt can be used to generate any of these. The commented out lines can be used to specify the location of the Open Babel library and include files if necessary.; cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6); add_executable(example example.cpp); target_link_libraries(example openbabel); # target_link_libraries(example /home/user/Tools/openbabel/install/lib/libopenbabel.so); # include_directories(/home/user/Tools/openbabel/install/include/openbabel-2.0).

Deployability,"e formats and, admittedly, those we use in our work. If you’d like to see other file formats added, we need one of:. documentation on the file format; working code to read the file format or translate it; example files in the new file format and in some other format. The latter obviously is the easiest with text file formats. Binary files take some time to reverse engineer without documentation or working code. Also consider pointing developers to this FAQ and the “What’s in it for me?” section.; When I convert from SMILES to MOL2/PDB/etc., why are all of the coordinates zero?; The SMILES format contains 2D information on the molecule. That is, it says which atoms are connected to which other atoms, and what type of bonds are present. MOL2, PDB and several other formats contain 3D coordinate information not present in the SMILES format. Since Open Babel does not attempt to generate 3D structure by default, all of the coordinates are set to zero. However, it is possible to generate 3D structure with the release of Open Babel 2.2.0 using the --gen3d option.; What sorts of features will be added in the future?; It’s an open project, so if features are suggested or donated, they’ll be considered as much as anything else on the drawing board. Some things are pretty clear from the roadmap. What’s in it for me to contribute?#; What’s in it for my chemistry software company?; If your product is closed-source or otherwise incompatible with the GPL, you unfortunately cannot link directly to the code library. You can, however, distribute Open Babel in unmodified form with your products to use the command-line interface. This is fairly easy because the Open Babel babel program allow reading from the standard input and writing to the standard output (functioning as a POSIX pipe).; If you decide to distribute binaries, you should either offer users the source if they want, or point them to the Open Babel website.

Interaction between the atoms and cage points#; Following the calculation of all required atomic properties, the next step in; the calculation of a Spectrophore consists of determining the total; interaction value V(c,p) between each of the atomic contributions of; property p with a set of interaction points on an artificial cage c; surrounding the molecular conformation. Schematic representation of a molecule surrounded by the artifical cage#. For this purpose, each of these; interaction points i on cage c is assigned a value P(c,i); which is either +1 or -1, with the constraint that the sum of all interaction; points on a particular cage should be zero. In a typical Spectrophore; calculation, a cage is represented as a rectangular box encompassing the; molecular conformation in all three dimensions, with the centers of the box; edges being the interaction points. Such a configuration gives twelve; interaction points per cage, and, in the case of a non-stereospecific; distribution of the interaction points, leads to 12 different cages. Although; there are no particular requirements as to the dimensions of the rectangular; cage, the distance between the interaction points and the geometrical extremes; of the molecule should be such that a meaningful interaction value between each; cage point and the molecular entity can be calculated. In this respect, the; default dimensions of the cage are constantly adjusted to enclose the molecule; at a minimum distance of 3 A along all dimensions. This cage size can be; modified by the user and influences the resolution of the Spectrophore.; The total interaction value V(c,p) between the atomic contribution values; A(j,p) of property p for a given molecular conformation and the; cage interaction values P(c,i) for a given cage c is calculated; according a standard interaction energy equation.

Deployability,"esent the methyl radical. How Open Babel does it#; Open Babel accepts molecules with explicit or implicit hydrogens and; can convert between the two. It will also handle radicals (and; other hydrogen-deficient species) with implicit hydrogen by using; internally a property of an atom, _spinmultiplicity, modelled on; the RAD property in MDL MOL files and also used in CML. This can be; regarded in the present context as a measure of the hydrogen; deficiency of an atom. Its value is:. 0 for normal atoms,; 2 for radical (missing one hydrogen) and; 1 or 3 for carbenes and nitrenes (missing two hydrogens). It happens that for some doubly deficient species, like carbene; CH2 and oxygen atoms, the singlet and triplet species are fairly close; in energy and both may be significant in certain applications such; as combustion, atmospheric or preparative organic chemistry, so it; is convenient that they can be described separately. There are of; course an infinity of other electronic configurations of molecules; but Open Babel has no special descriptors for them. However, even; more hydrogen-deficient atoms are indicated by the highest possible; value of spinmultiplicity (C atom has spin multiplicity of 5).; (This extends MDL’s RAD property which has a maximum value of 3.); If the spin multiplicity of an atom is not input explicitly, it is; set (in :obapi:`OBMol::AssignSpinMultiplicity() <OpenBabel::OBMol::AssignSpinMultiplicity>`) when the input format is; MOL, SMI, CML or Therm. This routine is called after all the atoms; and bonds of the molecule are known. It detects hydrogen deficiency; in an atom and assigns spin multiplicity appropriately. But because; hydrogen may be implicit it only does this for atoms which have at; least one explicit hydrogen or on atoms which have had; :obapi:`ForceNoH() <OpenBabel::OBAtom::ForceNoH>` called for them - which is effectively zero explicit; hydrogens. The latter is used, for instance, when SMILES inputs [O]; to ensure that it is seen a",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Features/Radicals.html:2967,configurat,configurations,2967,docs/Features/Radicals.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Features/Radicals.html,2,['configurat'],['configurations']

The current release (openbabel-3-1-1) of Open Babel is not available for your platform. We recommend always using the latest release.; You want more control over the features available. For example, perhaps you want the Python bindings but these were not included in your distribution.; You want to use the latest development code.; You want to add a new feature.

Open Babel can be compiled on Linux, MacOSX, BSDs and other Unixes, and also on Windows (with Cygwin, MinGW or MSVC). Requirements#; To build Open Babel, you need the following:. The source code for the latest release of Open Babel; A C++ compiler. Open Babel is written in standards-compliant C++. The best-supported compilers are GCC 4 and MSVC++ 2008, but it also compiles with Clang and Intel Compiler 11. CMake 2.8 or newer. Open Babel uses CMake as its build system. CMake is an open source cross-platform build system from KitWare.; You need to install CMake 2.8 or newer. This is available as a binary package from the KitWare website; alternatively, it may be available through your package manager (on Linux). If necessary, you can also compile it yourself from the source code. If you want to build the GUI (Graphical User Interface), you need the following in addition:. wxWidgets 2.8 (or newer). Binary packages may be available through your package manager (wx-common, wx2.8-headers and libwxbase2.8-dev on Ubuntu) or from http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/.

Deployability,"figure the build to use all of the default options:; $ cd build; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2. If you need to specify an option, use the -D switch to cmake. For example, the following line sets the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG. We will discuss various possible options later. At this point, it would be a good idea to compile Open Babel:; $ make. Have a coffee while the magic happens. If you have a multi-processor machine and would prefer an expresso, try a parallel build instead:; $ make -j4 # parallel build across 4 processors. And finally, as root (or using sudo) you should install it:; # make install. Local build#. Look Ma, no install!; With the right sort of environment variable magic (see below), you can actually use Open Babel straight from the build folder. But life is a bit easier if you install it somewhere, either system-wide or locally. By default, Open Babel is installed in /usr/local/ on a Unix-like system. This requires root access (or sudo). Even if you do have root access, you may not want to overwrite an existing installation or you may want to avoid conflicts with a version of Open Babel installed by your package manager.; The solution to all of these problems is to do a local install into a directory somewhere in your home folder.; An additional advantage of a local install is that if you ever want to uninstall it, all you need to do is delete the installation directory; removing the files from a global install is more work. To configure cmake to install into ~/Tools/openbabel-install, for example, you would do the following:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools/openbabel-install. Then you can run make and make install without needing root access:; $ make && make install. Compile the GUI#; The GUI is built using the wxWidgets toolkit.

The following CMakeLists.txt can be used to generate any of these. The commented out lines can be used to specify the location of the Open Babel library and include files if necessary.; cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6); add_executable(example example.cpp); target_link_libraries(example openbabel); # target_link_libraries(example /home/user/Tools/openbabel/install/lib/libopenbabel.so); # include_directories(/home/user/Tools/openbabel/install/include/openbabel-2.0).

Deployability,"gic (see below), you can actually use Open Babel straight from the build folder. But life is a bit easier if you install it somewhere, either system-wide or locally. By default, Open Babel is installed in /usr/local/ on a Unix-like system. This requires root access (or sudo). Even if you do have root access, you may not want to overwrite an existing installation or you may want to avoid conflicts with a version of Open Babel installed by your package manager.; The solution to all of these problems is to do a local install into a directory somewhere in your home folder.; An additional advantage of a local install is that if you ever want to uninstall it, all you need to do is delete the installation directory; removing the files from a global install is more work. To configure cmake to install into ~/Tools/openbabel-install, for example, you would do the following:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools/openbabel-install. Then you can run make and make install without needing root access:; $ make && make install. Compile the GUI#; The GUI is built using the wxWidgets toolkit. Assuming that you have already installed this (see Requirements above), you just need to configure cmake as follows:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DBUILD_GUI=ON. When you run make and make install, the GUI will be automatically built and installed alongside the main Open Babel library and tools. Compile language bindings#. Eigen required; If you wish to compile the language bindings supplied in the release, Eigen version 2 or newer is required (see Requirements above). When configuring CMake, include options such as -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DRUBY_BINDINGS=ON for whichever bindings you wish to build (valid names are PYTHON, CSHARP, PERL, JAVA or RUBY) or -DALL_BINDINGS=ON to build them all. The bindings will then be built and installed along with the rest of Open Babel. You should note any warning messages in the CMake output.; If CMake cannot find Java, you should set the value of",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html:7591,install,install,7591,docs/Installation/install.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html,4,['install'],['install']

Deployability,"ing is sometimes referred to as describing a 0.5D structure, as it can describe the relative arrangement of atoms around stereocenters. The SMILES reader simply reads and records this information as stereo data, and then the molecule is marked as having stereo perceived (unless the S option is passed - see below).; Being able to skip the symmetry analysis associated with stereo perception means that SMILES strings can be read quickly - a useful feature if dealing with millions of molecules. However, if you wish to identify additional stereocenters whose stereo configuration is unspecified, or if the SMILES strings come from an untrusted source and stereo may have been incorrectly specified (e.g. on a tetrahedral center with two groups the same), then you may wish to trigger perception.; Without any additional information, stereo cannot be perceived from a structure that has neither 2D nor 3D coordinates. Triggering stereo perception on such a structure will generate stereo data if stereogenic centers are present, but their configuration will be marked as unspecified. However, where existing stereo data is present (e.g. after reading a SMILES string), that data will be retained if the stereocenter is identified by the perception routine as a true stereocenter. This can be illustrated using the S option to the SMILES reader, which tells it not to mark the stereo as perceived on reading; as a result, reperception will occur if triggered by a writer yielding different results in the case of an erroneously specified stereocenter:; $ obabel -:""F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br"" -osmi; F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br; $ obabel -:""F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br"" -aS -osmi; FC(F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br.

In this setting, small local differences in the fields between; pairs of molecules will be picked up much more easily.; The absolute values of the individual Spectrophore data points are dependent; on the used resolution. Low resolution values lead to small values of the; calculated individual Spectrophore data points, while high resolutions will; lead to larger data values. It is therefore only meaningful to compare only; Spectrophores that have been generated using the same resolution settings or; after some kind of normalization is performed.; Computation time is not influenced by the specified resolution and hence; is identical for all different resolution settings. Stereospecificity#; Some of the cages that are used to calculated Spectrophores have a; stereospecific distribution of the interaction points. The resulting; interaction values resulting from these cages are therefore sensitive to the; enantiomeric configuration of the molecule within the cage. The fact that both; stereoselective as well as stereo non-selective cages can be used makes it; possible to include or exclude stereospecificity in the virtual screening; search. Depending on the desired output, the stereospecificity of; Spectrophores can be specified by the user using the -s option:. No stereospecificity (default):Spectrophores are generated using cages; that are not stereospecific. For most applications, these Spectrophores; will suffice.

Mirror stereospecificity:Mirror stereospecific Spectrophores are; Spectrophores resulting from the mirror enantiomeric form of the input; molecules.

Deployability,"irst of all, you need to create a fastsearch index (see above). The index is created with the following command:; babel mymols.sdf -ofs. Substructure searching is as for small datasets, except that the fastsearch index is used instead of the original file. This command will find all molecules containing 1,2-dicyanobenzene and return the results as SMILES strings:; babel mymols.fs -ifs -sN#Cc1ccccc1C#N results.smi. If all you want output are the molecule names then adding -xt will return just the molecule names:; babel mymols.fs -ifs -sN#Cc1ccccc1C#N results.smi -xt. Case study: Search ChEMBLdb#; This case study uses a combination of the techniques described above for similarity searching using large databases and using small databases. Note that we are using the default fingerprint for all of these analyses. The default fingerprint is FP2, a path-based fingerprint (somewhat similar to the Daylight fingerprints). Download Version 2 of ChEMBLdb from ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/ChEMBLdb/releases/.; After unzipping it, make a fastsearch index (this took 18 minutes on my machine for the 500K+ molecules):; babel chembl_02.sdf -ofs. Let’s use the first molecule in the sdf file as a query. Using Notepad (or on Linux, head -79 chembl_02.sdf) extract the first molecule and save it as first.sdf. Note that the molecules in the ChEMBL sdf do not have titles; instead, their IDs are stored in the “chebi_id” property field.; This first molecule is 100183. Check its ChEMBL page. It’s pretty weird, but is there anything similar in ChEMBLdb? Let’s find the 5 most similar molecules:; babel chembl_02.fs mostsim.sdf -s first.sdf -at5. The results are stored in mostsim.sdf, but how similar are these molecules to the query?:; babel first.sdf mostsim.sdf -ofpt; >; > Tanimoto from first mol = 1; Possible superstructure of first mol; > Tanimoto from first mol = 0.986301; > Tanimoto from first mol = 0.924051; Possible superstructure of first mol; > Tanimoto from first mol = 0.86904",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Fingerprints/fingerprints.html:7960,release,releases,7960,docs/Fingerprints/fingerprints.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Fingerprints/fingerprints.html,2,['release'],['releases']
Deployability,"irst step is to create these directories:; $ tar zxf openbabel-2.3.2.tar.gz # (this creates openbabel-2.3.2); $ mkdir build. Now you need to run cmake to configure the build. The following will configure the build to use all of the default options:; $ cd build; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2. If you need to specify an option, use the -D switch to cmake. For example, the following line sets the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG. We will discuss various possible options later. At this point, it would be a good idea to compile Open Babel:; $ make. Have a coffee while the magic happens. If you have a multi-processor machine and would prefer an expresso, try a parallel build instead:; $ make -j4 # parallel build across 4 processors. And finally, as root (or using sudo) you should install it:; # make install. Local build#. Look Ma, no install!; With the right sort of environment variable magic (see below), you can actually use Open Babel straight from the build folder. But life is a bit easier if you install it somewhere, either system-wide or locally. By default, Open Babel is installed in /usr/local/ on a Unix-like system. This requires root access (or sudo). Even if you do have root access, you may not want to overwrite an existing installation or you may want to avoid conflicts with a version of Open Babel installed by your package manager.; The solution to all of these problems is to do a local install into a directory somewhere in your home folder.; An additional advantage of a local install is that if you ever want to uninstall it, all you need to do is delete the installation directory; removing the files from a global install is more work. To configure cmake to install into ~/Tools/openbabel-install, for example, you would do the following:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools/openbabel-install. Then you can run make and make install without need",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html:6549,install,install,6549,docs/Installation/install.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html,2,['install'],['install']
Deployability,"is somewhat like searching for “221b Baker Street” and finding; nothing because the database contains “221B Baker Street” and the; system doesn’t consider “b” and “B” a match.; A good similarity search would find the target structure shown; above, because even though it is not a substructure match, it is; highly similar to our query.; There are many ways to measure similarity. 2D topologyThe best-known and most widely used similarity metrics compare the; two-dimensional topology, that is, they only use the molecule’s; atoms and bonds without considering its shape.; Tanimoto similarity is perhaps the best known as it is easy to; implement and fast to compute. An excellent summary of 2D; similarity metrics can be found in section 5.3 of the; Daylight Theory Manual. 3D configurationOne of the most important uses of similarity is in the discovery of; new drugs, and a molecule’s shape is critical to it’s medicinal; value (see QSAR).; 3D similarity searches compare the configuration (also called the; “conformation”) of a molecule to other molecules. The “electronic; surface” of the molecule is the important bit - the part that can; interact with other molecules. 3D searches compare the surfaces of; two molecules, and how polarized or polarizable each bit of the; surface is.; 3D similarity searches are uncommon, for two reasons: It’s; difficult and it’s slow. The difficulty comes from the complexity; of molecular interactions - a molecule is not a fixed shape, but; rather a dynamic object that changes according to its environment.; And the slowness comes from the difficulty: To get better results,; scientists employ more and more complex programs. Physical PropertiesThe above 2D and 3D similarity are based on the molecule’s; structure. Another technique compares the properties - either; computed or measured or both - and declares that molecules with; many properties in common are likely to have similar structure.

User Guide; Write software using the Open Babel library; The Open Babel API. The Open Babel API#; The API (Application Programming Interface) is the set of classes, methods and variables that a programming library provides to the user. The Open Babel API is implemented in C++, but the same set of classes, methods and variables are accessed through the various language bindings.; The API documentation is automatically generated from the source code using the Doxygen tool. The following links point to the various versions of the documentation:. API for the current release; API for the development version (updated nightly, with error report showing errors in documentation); API for specific versions: 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3. The Open Babel toolkit uses a version numbering that indicates how the API has changed over time:. Bug fix releases (e.g., 2.0.0, vs. 2.0.1) do not change API at all.; Minor versions (e.g., 2.0 vs. 2.1) will add function calls, but will be otherwise backwards-compatible.; Major versions (e.g. 2 vs 3) are not backwards-compatible, and have changes in the API. Overall, our goal is for the Open Babel API to remain stable over as long a period as possible. This means that users can be confident that their code will continue to work despite the release of new versions with additional features, file formats and bug fixes. For example, at the time of writing we have been on the version 2 series for almost five years (since November 2005). In other words, a program written using Open Babel almost five years ago still works with the latest release. previous; Write software using the Open Babel library. next; C++. ; ; ; Edit on GitHub; ; ; . ; © Copyright ©2023 The Open Babel Team.; .

User Guide; Tutorial on using the GUI; Substructure... Substructure and similarity searching a large dataset#; Open Babel provides a format called the fs -- fastsearch index which should be used when searching large datasets (like ChEMBL) for molecules similar to a particular query. There are faster ways of searching (like using a chemical database) but FastSearch is convenient, and should give reasonable performance for most people.; To demonstrate similarity searching, we will use the first 1000 molecules in the latest release of ChEMBL:. Download the 2D SDF version of ChEMBL, chembl_nn.sdf.gz, from the ChEMBLdb download site and save in your Work folder. (Note: this is a gzipped file, but Open Babel will handle this without problems.); Set up an SDF to SDF conversion, set chembl_nn.sdf.gz as the input file and 1000_chembl.sdf as the output file.; Only convert the first 1000 molecules by entering 1000 in the box End import at molecule # specified. Click CONVERT. We can going to use the following structure for substructure and similarity searching. It can be represented by the SMILES string Nc1ccc(N)cc1. How the search works; Behind the scenes, the FastSearch index simply stores a path-based; binary fingerprint for each molecule. When used to search, similarity; is measured based on the Tanimoto coefficient. For exact search, hits; are verified by Open Babel’s graph isomorphism matcher. Next, we will create a FastSearch index for this dataset of 1000 molecules:.

Identical molecule:; obabel index.fs -O outfile.yyy -s SMILES exact. Substructure:; obabel index.fs -O outfile.yyy -s SMILES or; obabel index.fs -O outfile.yyy -s filename.xxx. where xxx is a format id known to OpenBabel, e.g. sdf. Molecular similarity based on Tanimoto coefficient:; obabel index.fs -O outfile.yyy -at15 -sSMILES # best 15 molecules; obabel index.fs -O outfile.yyy -at0.7 -sSMILES # Tanimoto >0.7; obabel index.fs -O outfile.yyy -at0.7,0.9 -sSMILES; # Tanimoto >0.7 && Tanimoto < 0.9. The datafile plus the -ifs option can be used instead of the index file.; NOTE on 32-bit systems the datafile MUST NOT be larger than 4GB.; Dative bonds like -[N+][O-](=O) are indexed as -N(=O)(=O), and when searching; the target molecule should be in the second form.

Deployability,"nEye decided that for their purposes OELib needed a rewrite (now called OEChem), but this would be closed-source to include some advanced algorithms. So the GPL’ed version of OELib would not be maintained. Instead, the free version of OELib was renamed and has become “Open Babel” with the blessing of Matt and other contributors.; Open Babel has evolved quite a lot since its birth in 2001.; What’s the latest version?; As of this writing, the latest version is Open Babel openbabel-3-1-1. This is a stable version suitable for widespread use and development.; Can I use Open Babel code in a personal project?; One common misconception about the GNU GPL license for Open Babel is that it requires users to release any code that uses the Open Babel library. This is completely untrue. There are no restrictions on use of Open Babel code for personal projects, regardless of where you work (academia, industry, … wherever).; However, if you intend on releasing a software package that uses Open Babel code, the GPL requires that your package be released under the GNU GPL license. The distinction is between use and distribution. See What’s in it for me to contribute? below for more on the licensing issues.; How do I cite Open Babel in a paper?; To support development of Open Babel, please cite:. Hutchison et al. [obj2011].

This includes all of the supporting language bindings (for example, Python scripts) as well as C++ programs. To summarise, if you are considering distributing your software to other people, you must make your source code available to them on request. Open Babel is a C++ library and can easily be used from C++. In addition it can be accessed from Python, Perl, Ruby, CSharp and Java. These are referred to as language bindings (the Python bindings, etc.) and they were automatically generated from the C++ library using SWIG.

Deployability,"o a SMILES string). If this is needed, the user will have to manipulate the coordinates themselves, or generate coordinates for the whole molecule using the associated library functions (e.g. the --gen3d operation).; 2D structures; 2D structures represent a depiction of a molecule, where stereochemistry is usually indicated by wedge or hash bonds. It is sometimes indicated by adopting particular conventions (e.g. the Fischer or Haworth projection of monosaccharides). It should be noted that Open Babel does not support any of these conventions, nor does it support the use of wedge or hash bonds for perspective drawing (e.g. where a thick bond is supported by two wedges). This may change in future, of course, but it’s worth noting that Open Babel is not the only toolkit with these limitations and so what you think you are storing in your database may not be what the ‘computer’ thinks it is.; Stereo centers are identified based on a symmetry analysis, and their configuration inferred either from the geometry (for cis/trans bonds) or from bonds marked as wedge/hash (tetrahedral centers). File format readers record information about which bonds were marked as wedges or hashes and this can be accessed with OBBond:IsWedge/IsHash, where the Begin atom of the bond is considered the origin of the wedge/hash. Similar to the situation with 3D perception, changing a bond from a wedge to a hash (or vice versa) has no affect on the stereo objects once stereo has been perceived, but triggering reperception will regenerate the desired stereo data.; It should also be noted that the file writers regenerate the wedges or hashes from the stereo data at the point of writing; in other words, the particular location of the wedge/hash (or even whether it is present) may change on writing. This was done to ensure that the written structure accurately represents Open Babel’s internal view of the molecule; passing wedges/hashes through unchanged may not represent this (consider the case where a",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:12127,configurat,configuration,12127,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,2,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"ochemical configuration is accessed via a Config() object associated with each StereoData. The contents of this object will be different depending on the specific type of stereochemistry, e.g. OBCisTransStereo::Config (OBCisTransConfig from Python) records the begin and end Ids of the associated bond, the Ids of the attached atoms, the spatial relationship of those atoms, and whether stereo is specified.; Let’s read the SMILES string F[C@@](Cl)(Br)I and access the stereo.

Which prints:; Does this atom have tet stereo info? True; The stereocenter is at atom Id 1; Is the configuration specified? Yes; Looking from atom Id 0, the atoms Ids (2, 3, 4) are arranged clockwise. How do I know that I’m looking from atom Id 0, and that the atom Ids are arranged clockwise? From the documentation for OBTetrahedralStereo::GetConfig, which states that this is the default. You may be used to thinking “How are these atoms arranged looking from here?”. With GetConfig(), you are instead making the request “Give me the atoms in clockwise order looking from here”. It follows from this that you should never need to test the value of the winding, the direction, or the from/towards atom; you provide these, and their values will be whatever you provided.

Deployability,"ommended way to build Open Babel is to use a separate source and build directory; for example, openbabel-2.3.2 and build. The first step is to create these directories:; $ tar zxf openbabel-2.3.2.tar.gz # (this creates openbabel-2.3.2); $ mkdir build. Now you need to run cmake to configure the build. The following will configure the build to use all of the default options:; $ cd build; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2. If you need to specify an option, use the -D switch to cmake. For example, the following line sets the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG. We will discuss various possible options later. At this point, it would be a good idea to compile Open Babel:; $ make. Have a coffee while the magic happens. If you have a multi-processor machine and would prefer an expresso, try a parallel build instead:; $ make -j4 # parallel build across 4 processors. And finally, as root (or using sudo) you should install it:; # make install. Local build#. Look Ma, no install!; With the right sort of environment variable magic (see below), you can actually use Open Babel straight from the build folder. But life is a bit easier if you install it somewhere, either system-wide or locally. By default, Open Babel is installed in /usr/local/ on a Unix-like system. This requires root access (or sudo). Even if you do have root access, you may not want to overwrite an existing installation or you may want to avoid conflicts with a version of Open Babel installed by your package manager.; The solution to all of these problems is to do a local install into a directory somewhere in your home folder.; An additional advantage of a local install is that if you ever want to uninstall it, all you need to do is delete the installation directory; removing the files from a global install is more work. To configure cmake to install into ~/Tools/openbabel-install, for example, you would do the following:; $",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html:6494,install,install,6494,docs/Installation/install.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html,4,['install'],['install']

Deployability,"prisingly, “babel” is used frequently in a lot of software names.; Is it Open Babel or OpenBabel?; Your choice. It’s probably easier to call it Open Babel since that’s what it is–an open version of Babel. But if you like one-word, mixed-case project names, then go for OpenBabel. In that case, the space is just too small to be printed.; How does this relate to the original Babel and OELib, the “next” Babel?; The original Babel was written by Pat Walters and Matt Stahl, based on the “convert” program by Ajay Shah, and is still a remarkable application. Both Pat and Matt have moved on to other work. The original Babel is hosted by Smog.com on a Babel homepage, by the Computational Chemistry List (CCL) and of course by Open Babel at SourceForge.net.; Along the way, the two original authors started a rewrite of Babel into C++ they called OBabel, which was never really publicly released. But Matt used some of these ideas in OELib, which was generously released under the GNU GPL by his employer, OpenEye Software, and the last known version of this OELib is still available from our file repository.; OpenEye decided that for their purposes OELib needed a rewrite (now called OEChem), but this would be closed-source to include some advanced algorithms. So the GPL’ed version of OELib would not be maintained. Instead, the free version of OELib was renamed and has become “Open Babel” with the blessing of Matt and other contributors.; Open Babel has evolved quite a lot since its birth in 2001.; What’s the latest version?; As of this writing, the latest version is Open Babel openbabel-3-1-1. This is a stable version suitable for widespread use and development.; Can I use Open Babel code in a personal project?; One common misconception about the GNU GPL license for Open Babel is that it requires users to release any code that uses the Open Babel library. This is completely untrue. There are no restrictions on use of Open Babel code for personal projects, regardless of where you work ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Introduction/faq.html:2767,release,released,2767,docs/Introduction/faq.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Introduction/faq.html,2,['release'],['released']

Deployability,"rich support for your file formats. So if you contribute a small amount of code under the GPL to read/write your files, everything else is handled by Open Babel.; It’s a win-win for everyone. The community benefits by having feature-rich translation code and open file formats. Your company and its programs benefit by the ability to read just about every format imaginable. Users benefit by using the programs they need for the tasks they need.; What’s in it for me as an academic?; If you’re an academic developer, you certainly should read the previous answer too. It takes little work on your part to interface with Open Babel and you get a lot in return.; But even if you’re just an academic user, there’s a lot of reasons to contribute. Most of us deal with a variety of file formats in our work. So it’s useful to translate these cleanly. If a format isn’t currently supported by Open Babel, see above. If you find bugs please report them. Since it’s open source, you can patch the code yourself, recompile and have the problem fixed very quickly.; If you’re inclined to write code, the GPL is an excellent option for the academic. You’re the original copyright holder, so you can do whatever you want with the code, in addition to selling it. But if you’ve also licensed it under the GPL, no one can distribute it as proprietary (i.e., closed-source) software without your agreement. Fellow academics can use it directly, learn from it, improve it and contribute back to you. Isn’t that why many of us went into science?; Once licensed under the GPL, the code must remain free to interested parties. If someone modifies it, that code must still remain under the GPL, free for all.; What’s in it for an open-source software project?; Certainly the answers for closed-source software and academics also apply for you. Beyond that, if your code is compatible with the GPL, you can directly use Open Babel and all of the API.

Deployability,"rmation at Coffee Driven Development on how to get around this. MacOSX and Linux#; On Linux and MacOSX you need to use Mono, the open source implementation of the .NET framework, to compile the bindings. The following instructions describe how to compile and use these bindings:. OBDotNet.dll is included in the Open Babel source distribution in scripts/csharp. To compile a CSharp application that uses this (e.g. the example program shown below), use a command similar to the following:; gmcs example.cs /reference:../openbabel-2.3.2/scripts/csharp/OBDotNet.dll. To run this on MacOSX or Linux you need to compile the CSharp bindings as described in the section Compile language bindings. This creates lib/libopenbabel_csharp.so in the build directory.; Add the location of OBDotNet.dll to the environment variable MONO_PATH. Add the location of libopenbabel_csharp.so to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Additionally, if you have not installed Open Babel globally you should set BABEL_LIBDIR to the location of the Open Babel library and BABEL_DATADIR to the data directory.; Run example.exe:; $ ./example.exe; 44.09562. OBDotNet API#; The API is almost identical to the Open Babel C++ API. Differences are described here.; Using iterators; In OBDotNet, iterators are provided as methods of the relevant class. The full list is as follows:. OBMol has .Atoms(), .Bonds(), .Residues(), and .Fragments(). These correspond to :obapi:`OBMolAtomIter`, :obapi:`OBMolBondIter`, :obapi:`OBResidueIter` and :obapi:`OBMolAtomDFSIter` respectively.; OBAtom has .Bonds() and .Neighbours(). These correspond to :obapi:`OBAtomBondIter` and :obapi:`OBAtomAtomIter` respectively. Such iterators are used as follows:; foreach (OBAtom atom in myobmol.Atoms()); System.Console.WriteLine(atom.GetAtomType());. Other iterators in the C++ API not listed above can still be used through their IEnumerator methods.; Handling OBGenericData; To cast :obapi:`OBGenericData` to a specific subclass, you should use the ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/CSharp.html:3349,install,installed,3349,docs/UseTheLibrary/CSharp.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/CSharp.html,2,['install'],['installed']

Even if you do have root access, you may not want to overwrite an existing installation or you may want to avoid conflicts with a version of Open Babel installed by your package manager.; The solution to all of these problems is to do a local install into a directory somewhere in your home folder.; An additional advantage of a local install is that if you ever want to uninstall it, all you need to do is delete the installation directory; removing the files from a global install is more work. To configure cmake to install into ~/Tools/openbabel-install, for example, you would do the following:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools/openbabel-install. Then you can run make and make install without needing root access:; $ make && make install. Compile the GUI#; The GUI is built using the wxWidgets toolkit. Assuming that you have already installed this (see Requirements above), you just need to configure cmake as follows:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DBUILD_GUI=ON. When you run make and make install, the GUI will be automatically built and installed alongside the main Open Babel library and tools. Compile language bindings#. Eigen required; If you wish to compile the language bindings supplied in the release, Eigen version 2 or newer is required (see Requirements above). When configuring CMake, include options such as -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DRUBY_BINDINGS=ON for whichever bindings you wish to build (valid names are PYTHON, CSHARP, PERL, JAVA or RUBY) or -DALL_BINDINGS=ON to build them all.

CSharp and OBDotNet#; OBDotNet is a compiled assembly that allows Open Babel to be used from the various .NET languages (e.g. Visual Basic, C#, IronPython, IronRuby, and J#) on Windows, Linux and MacOSX. The current version is OBDotNet 0.4. Installation#. Windows#; The OBDotNet.dll assembly provided on Windows was compiled using the .NET framework v3.5 for the x86 platform. To use it, you will need to compile your code using .NET v3.5 or newer and you will also need to target x86 (/platform:x86).; The following instructions describe how to compile a simple C# program that uses OBDotNet:. First you need to download and install the OpenBabelGUI version 2.3.2; Next create an example CSharp program that uses the Open Babel API (see below for one or use this link). Let’s call this example.cs.; Copy OBDotNet.dll from the Open Babel installation into the same folder as example.cs.; Open a command prompt at the location of example.cs and compile it as follows:; C:\Work> C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\csc.exe; /reference:OBDotNet.dll /platform:x86 example.cs. Run the created executable, example.exe, to discover the molecule weight of propane:; C:\Work> example.exe; 44.09562. If you prefer to use the MSVC# GUI, note that the Express edition does not have the option to choose x86 as a target. This will be a problem if you are using a 64-bit operating system. There’s some information at Coffee Driven Development on how to get around this. MacOSX and Linux#; On Linux and MacOSX you need to use Mono, the open source implementation of the .NET framework, to compile the bindings.

You can either install a binary package (the easiest option) or compile Open Babel yourself (also easy, but much more geek cred). Install a binary package#. Windows#; Open Babel is available as a binary installer for Windows, both 64-bit (preferred) or 32-bit (indicated by x86 in the filename). It includes several command-line tools as well as a graphical user interface (GUI). The latest version can be download from GitHub.; Advanced users may be interested in compiling Open Babel themselves (see Compiling Open Babel). Linux#; Open Babel binary packages are available from many Linux distributions including Ubuntu, OpenSUSE and Fedora.; In general, we recommend using the latest release of Open Babel (currently openbabel-3-1-1). If this is not available for your Linux distribution, you should compile Open Babel yourself. Compiling Open Babel#; Open Babel is written in C++. Compiling is the process of turning this C++ into instructions that the computer’s processor can understand, machine code.; Although pre-compiled (or “binary”) packages are available for several platforms, there are several reasons you might want to compile Open Babel yourself:.

To revert to a regular build use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release.; How do I see what commands cmake is using to build?; Run Make as follows:; $ VERBOSE=1 make. How do I build one specific target?; Just specify the target when running Make. The following just builds the Python bindings:; $ make _openbabel. To speed things up, you can ask Make to ignore dependencies:; $ make _openbabel/fast. How do I create the SWIG bindings?; Use the -DRUN_SWIG=ON option with CMake. This requires SWIG 2.0 or newer.

Deployability,"t, Open Babel is installed in /usr/local/ on a Unix-like system. This requires root access (or sudo). Even if you do have root access, you may not want to overwrite an existing installation or you may want to avoid conflicts with a version of Open Babel installed by your package manager.; The solution to all of these problems is to do a local install into a directory somewhere in your home folder.; An additional advantage of a local install is that if you ever want to uninstall it, all you need to do is delete the installation directory; removing the files from a global install is more work. To configure cmake to install into ~/Tools/openbabel-install, for example, you would do the following:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools/openbabel-install. Then you can run make and make install without needing root access:; $ make && make install. Compile the GUI#; The GUI is built using the wxWidgets toolkit. Assuming that you have already installed this (see Requirements above), you just need to configure cmake as follows:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DBUILD_GUI=ON. When you run make and make install, the GUI will be automatically built and installed alongside the main Open Babel library and tools. Compile language bindings#. Eigen required; If you wish to compile the language bindings supplied in the release, Eigen version 2 or newer is required (see Requirements above). When configuring CMake, include options such as -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DRUBY_BINDINGS=ON for whichever bindings you wish to build (valid names are PYTHON, CSHARP, PERL, JAVA or RUBY) or -DALL_BINDINGS=ON to build them all. The bindings will then be built and installed along with the rest of Open Babel. You should note any warning messages in the CMake output.; If CMake cannot find Java, you should set the value of the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the directory containing the Java bin and lib directories. For example, if you download the JDK from Sun and run the self-extracting .b",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html:7748,install,installed,7748,docs/Installation/install.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Installation/install.html,2,['install'],['installed']

Deployability,"the magic happens. If you have a multi-processor machine and would prefer an expresso, try a parallel build instead:; $ make -j4 # parallel build across 4 processors. And finally, as root (or using sudo) you should install it:; # make install. Local build#. Look Ma, no install!; With the right sort of environment variable magic (see below), you can actually use Open Babel straight from the build folder. But life is a bit easier if you install it somewhere, either system-wide or locally. By default, Open Babel is installed in /usr/local/ on a Unix-like system. This requires root access (or sudo). Even if you do have root access, you may not want to overwrite an existing installation or you may want to avoid conflicts with a version of Open Babel installed by your package manager.; The solution to all of these problems is to do a local install into a directory somewhere in your home folder.; An additional advantage of a local install is that if you ever want to uninstall it, all you need to do is delete the installation directory; removing the files from a global install is more work. To configure cmake to install into ~/Tools/openbabel-install, for example, you would do the following:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Tools/openbabel-install. Then you can run make and make install without needing root access:; $ make && make install. Compile the GUI#; The GUI is built using the wxWidgets toolkit. Assuming that you have already installed this (see Requirements above), you just need to configure cmake as follows:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DBUILD_GUI=ON. When you run make and make install, the GUI will be automatically built and installed alongside the main Open Babel library and tools. Compile language bindings#.

Deployability,"the self-extracting .bin file, it creates a directory jdk1.6.0_21 (or similar); you should set JAVA_HOME to the full path to this directory.; If CMake cannot find the Perl libraries (which happens on Ubuntu 10.10, surprisingly), you need to configure CMake with something like -DPERL_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libperl.so.5.10 -DPERL_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/lib/perl/5.10.1/CORE.; If you are compiling the CSharp bindings, you should specify the CSharp compiler to use with something like -DCSHARP_EXECUTABLE=C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\csc.exe.; When you run make install, all of the bindings will be installed to the same location as the Open Babel libraries (typically /usr/local/lib).; To prepare to use the bindings, add the install directory to the front of the appropriate environment variable: PYTHONPATH for Python, PERL5LIB for Perl, RUBYLIB for Ruby, CLASSPATH for Java, and MONO_PATH for Mono. For example, for Python:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON; $ make; # make install; $ export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib:$PYTHONPATH. Cygwin#; The basic build instructions up above work just fine so long as you use the CMake provided by Cygwin rather than a native Windows installation.; If you get an error about undefined reference to '_xmlFreeTextReader', you need to specify the location of the XML libraries with the -DLIBXML2_LIBRARIES option:; $ cmake ../openbabel-2.3.2 -DLIBXML2_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/libxml2.dll.a. The language bindings don’t seem to work under Cygwin. If you can get them to work, let us know. Also remember that anything that uses Cygwin runs slower than a native build using MinGW or MSVC++, so if speed is an issue you might prefer to compile with MinGW or MSVC++. MinGW#; Open Babel builds out of the box with MinGW. It’s an awkward system to set up though, so here are some step-by-step instructions…TODO.

Deployability,"ular location of the wedge/hash (or even whether it is present) may change on writing. This was done to ensure that the written structure accurately represents Open Babel’s internal view of the molecule; passing wedges/hashes through unchanged may not represent this (consider the case where a wedge bond is attached to a tetrahedral center which cannot be a stereocenter).; 0D structures; A SMILES string is sometimes referred to as describing a 0.5D structure, as it can describe the relative arrangement of atoms around stereocenters. The SMILES reader simply reads and records this information as stereo data, and then the molecule is marked as having stereo perceived (unless the S option is passed - see below).; Being able to skip the symmetry analysis associated with stereo perception means that SMILES strings can be read quickly - a useful feature if dealing with millions of molecules. However, if you wish to identify additional stereocenters whose stereo configuration is unspecified, or if the SMILES strings come from an untrusted source and stereo may have been incorrectly specified (e.g. on a tetrahedral center with two groups the same), then you may wish to trigger perception.; Without any additional information, stereo cannot be perceived from a structure that has neither 2D nor 3D coordinates. Triggering stereo perception on such a structure will generate stereo data if stereogenic centers are present, but their configuration will be marked as unspecified. However, where existing stereo data is present (e.g. after reading a SMILES string), that data will be retained if the stereocenter is identified by the perception routine as a true stereocenter. This can be illustrated using the S option to the SMILES reader, which tells it not to mark the stereo as perceived on reading; as a result, reperception will occur if triggered by a writer yielding different results in the case of an erroneously specified stereocenter:; $ obabel -:""F[C@@](F)(F)[C@@H](I)Br"" -osmi; F[C",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html:13831,configurat,configuration,13831,docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Stereochemistry/stereo.html,2,['configurat'],['configuration']

Options specific to particular input or output formatsThese are specified with the -a and -x prefixes. General optionsThese usually operate on a molecule after it has been read by the input format and before it has been written by the output format. The ones of interest here are the general options. These can be single letter options like -c (which centers coordinates), or multi-character options like --separate (which makes separate molecules from disconnected fragments). The ones mentioned are hardwired into the code, but it is possible to define new options that work in a similar way. This is done using the :obapi:`OBOp` class.

The latest version can be download from GitHub.; Advanced users may be interested in compiling Open Babel themselves (see Compiling Open Babel). Linux#; Open Babel binary packages are available from many Linux distributions including Ubuntu, OpenSUSE and Fedora.; In general, we recommend using the latest release of Open Babel (currently openbabel-3-1-1). If this is not available for your Linux distribution, you should compile Open Babel yourself. Compiling Open Babel#; Open Babel is written in C++. Compiling is the process of turning this C++ into instructions that the computer’s processor can understand, machine code.; Although pre-compiled (or “binary”) packages are available for several platforms, there are several reasons you might want to compile Open Babel yourself:. The current release (openbabel-3-1-1) of Open Babel is not available for your platform. We recommend always using the latest release.; You want more control over the features available. For example, perhaps you want the Python bindings but these were not included in your distribution.; You want to use the latest development code.; You want to add a new feature. It is easy to add new formats or operations to Open Babel as it has a plugin architecture (see Adding plugins).; You just want to compile stuff yourself. We understand. Open Babel can be compiled on Linux, MacOSX, BSDs and other Unixes, and also on Windows (with Cygwin, MinGW or MSVC). Requirements#; To build Open Babel, you need the following:.

Adding a new test#; Tests allow us to maintain code quality, ensure that code is working, prevent regressions, and facilitate refactoring. Personally, I find that there is no better motivation for writing tests than knowing that that bug I fixed will stay fixed, and that feature I implemented will not be broken by others. As an open source developer, I never have enough time; tests ensure that what time I have is not wasted.; We can divide the existing tests into three classes, based on how they test the Open Babel codebase:. Tests written in C++ that test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the SWIG bindings to test the public API; Tests written in Python that use the command-line executables for testing. Which type of test should you write? It doesn’t really matter - it’s more important that you write some type of test. Personally, I can more quickly test more if I write the test in Python, so generally I write and check-in tests of type (2) above; when I need to run a testcase in a debugger, I write a sh",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Testing.html:270,Install,Install,270,docs/Contributing/Testing.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Testing.html,2,"['Install', 'Release']","['Install', 'Release']"

Adding new operations and options#; The babel command line has the form:; babel inputfile [outputfile] [options]. There are several types of options:. Options that control the conversion processFor example -i, -o and -m. Options specific to particular input or output formatsThese are specified with the -a and -x prefixes. General optionsThese usually operate on a molecule after it has been read by the input format and before it has been written by the output format. The ones of interest here are the general options. These can be single letter options like -c (which centers coordinates), or multi-character options like --separate (which makes separate molecules from disconnected fragments). The ones mentioned are hardwired into the code, but it is possible to define new options that work in a similar way. This is done using the :obapi:`OBOp` class. The OBOp class#; The name :obapi:`OBOp` is intended to imply an operation as well as an option.

Supported File Formats and Options; Descriptors; Charge models; Release Notes. User Guide; Adding plugins. Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/index.html:267,Install,Install,267,docs/WritePlugins/index.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/index.html,2,"['Install', 'Release']","['Install', 'Release']"

CSharp and OBDotNet#; OBDotNet is a compiled assembly that allows Open Babel to be used from the various .NET languages (e.g. Visual Basic, C#, IronPython, IronRuby, and J#) on Windows, Linux and MacOSX. The current version is OBDotNet 0.4. Installation#. Windows#; The OBDotNet.dll assembly provided on Windows was compiled using the .NET framework v3.5 for the x86 platform. To use it, you will need to compile your code using .NET v3.5 or newer and you will also need to target x86 (/platform:x86).; The following instructions describe how to compile a simple C# program that uses OBDotNet:. First you need to download and install the OpenBabelGUI version 2.3.2; Next create an example CSharp program that uses the Open Babel API (see below for one or use this link). Let’s call this example.cs.; Copy OBDotNet.dll from the Open Babel installation into the same folder as example.cs.; Open a command prompt at the location of example.cs and compile it as follows:; C:\Work> C:\Windows\Micros",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/CSharp.html:272,Install,Install,272,docs/UseTheLibrary/CSharp.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/CSharp.html,2,"['Install', 'Release']","['Install', 'Release']"

The following examples show how this is done. File conversion#; Let’s convert a PDB file to MOL format:. Create a folder on the Desktop called Work; Download the PDB file for insulin (4ins) from the Protein Data Bank and save it in the Work folder; Set the input file format to PDB and the input filename to the downloaded PDB file. Set the output file format to MOL and the output filename to file:4ins.mol in the Work folder. Now click CONVERT. Converting without files#; Rather than use input and output files, it is possible to paste the contents of a chemical file format into the input box, and see the results of the conversion in the output box.; Here we will try this with the SMILES format, and illustrate how stereochemistry is handled by SMILES:. Screenshot. Choose the SMILES format as the input format; Tick the box Input below (ignore input file); Copy and paste the following SMILES",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/GUITutorial/Conversion.html:285,Install,Install,285,docs/GUITutorial/Conversion.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/GUITutorial/Conversion.html,2,"['Install', 'Release']","['Install', 'Release']"

Developing Open Babel#; Due to its open nature of its development, Open Babel contains code contributed by a wide variety of developers (see Thanks). This section describes some general guidelines and “best practices” for code developers. Developer Resources#; For new and existing developers here are some useful resources:. GitHub project page; Development version API documentation; Development version Sphinx documentation. Working with the Development Code#; To download and update the latest version of the Open Babel source code, you need Git. Git is the name of the project used to maintain the Open Babel version control repository. There are many clients for Git, including command-line and GUI applications. Keeping up to date with Git#. Check out the latest development version:; git clone https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel.git openbabel-dev. This creates a directory called openbabel-dev, which contains the latest source code from Open Babel.

Documentation#; Documenting Open Babel is an important and ongoing task. As an open source project, code must be documented, both for other developers to use the API and for others to follow your code. This includes clear documentation on the interfaces of particular classes and methods (that is, the API documentation) but also tutorials and examples of using the Open Babel library to accomplish clear tasks.; Beyond the documentation described above, as an open-source project involving many, many contributors, the internal code should be clearly commented and easy to read (in English, preferably, since this is the common language of developers on the project). Adding New Code#; The golden rule is write the documentation, then code to the specs.; You should never, ever start writing code unless you’ve specified, clearly and exactly, what your code will do. This makes life easier for you (i.e., you know exactly what the code should do), and for others reading your code.; This mantra also facilitates writing tests (see Adding a ne",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Documentation.html:266,Install,Install,266,docs/Contributing/Documentation.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Contributing/Documentation.html,2,"['Install', 'Release']","['Install', 'Release']"

General#; What is Open Babel?; Put simply, Open Babel is a free, open-source version of the Babel chemistry file translation program. Open Babel is a project designed to pick up where Babel left off, as a cross-platform program and library designed to interconvert between many file formats used in molecular modeling, computational chemistry, and many related areas.; Open Babel includes two components, a command-line utility and a C++ library. The command-line utility is intended to be used as a replacement for the original babel program, to translate between various chemical file formats. The C++ library includes all of the file-translation code as well as a wide variety of utilities to foster development of other open source scientific software.; How does this relate to BabelChat, BabelFish, Babel IM, etc. …?; It doesn’t. Not surprisingly, “babel” is used frequently in a lot of software names.; Is it Open Babel or OpenBabel?; Your choice. It’s probably easier to call it Open Babel since that’s what it is–an open version",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Introduction/faq.html:348,Install,Install,348,docs/Introduction/faq.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Introduction/faq.html,2,"['Install', 'Release']","['Install', 'Release']"

OBBuilder#; The :obapi:`OBBuilder` class is the part of Open Babel that can take a; 2D or 0D structure and generate a 3D structure. The 3D structure is; made very quickly using a combination of rules (e.g. sp3 atoms should have four bonds arranged in a tetrahedron) and common fragments (e.g. cyclohexane is shaped like a chair).; The 3D structures that come straight out of OBBuilder may be useful for some purposes but most people will want to “clean them up”. This is because they may have clashes or have high energy structures due to some strain. The conformer search or geometry optimization methods described below are typically used after calling OBBuilder.; Full discussion of the methods for coordinate generation is available in ‘Fast, efficient fragment-based coordinate generation for Open Babel’ *J.

They may also be useful if considering writing some sort of shape comparison method.; Open Babel has two distinct conformer generating codes:.

Goals of the Open Babel project#; Open Babel is a project to facilitate the interconversion of chemical data from one format to another – including file formats of various types. This is important for the following reasons:. Multiple programs are often required in realistic workflows. These may include databases, modeling or computational programs, visualization programs, etc.; Many programs have individual data formats, and/or support only a small subset of other file types.; Chemical representations often vary considerably:. Some programs are 2D. Some are 3D. Some use fractional k-space coordinates.; Some programs use bonds and atoms of discrete types. Others use only atoms and electrons.; Some programs use symmetric representations. Others do not.; Some programs specify all atoms. Others use “residues” or omit hydrogen atoms. Individual implementations of even standardized file formats are often buggy, incomplete or do not completely match published standards. As a free, and open source project, Open Babel improves by way of helping others.

User Guide; Handling of... Handling of aromaticity#; The purpose of this section is to give an overview of how Open Babel handles aromaticity. Given that atoms can be aromatic, bonds can be aromatic, and that molecules have a flag for aromaticity perceived, it’s important to understand how these all work together. How is aromaticity information stored?#; Like many other toolkits, Open Babel stores aromaticity information separate from bond order information. This means that there isn’t a special bond order to indicate aromatic bond. Instead, aromaticity is stored as a flag on an atom as well as a flag on a bond. You can access and set this information using the following API functions:. OBAtom::IsAromatic(), OBAtom::SetAromatic(), OBBond::UnsetAromatic(); OBBond::IsAromatic(), OBBond::SetAromatic(), OBBond::UnsetAromatic(). There is a catch though, or rather a key point to note. OBMols have a flag to indicate whether aromaticity has been perceived. This is set via the following API functions:. OBMol::SetAromaticPerceived(), OBMol::UnsetAromaticPerceived(). The value of this flag determines the behaviour of the OBAtom and OBBond IsAromatic() functions.

Add a new group contribution descriptor#; Group contribution descriptors are a common type of molecular descriptor whose value is a sum of contributions from substructures of the molecule. Such a descriptor can easily be added to Open Babel without the need to recompile the code. All you need is a set of SMARTS strings for each group, and their corresponding contributions to the descriptor value.; The following example shows how to add a new descriptor, hellohalo, whose value increments by 1, 2, 3 or 4 for each F, Cl, Br, and I (respectively) in the molecule. Create a working directory, for example C:\Work.; Copy the plugin definition file, plugindefines.txt to the working directory. This file can be found in the Open Babel data directory (typically in /usr/share/openbabel on Linux systems, or C:\Users\username\AppDataRoaming\OpenBabel-2.3.2\data on Windows).; For the hellohalo descriptor, add the following to the end of plugindefines.txt (make sure to include a blank line b",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddNewDescriptor.html:280,Install,Install,280,docs/WritePlugins/AddNewDescriptor.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddNewDescriptor.html,2,"['Install', 'Release']","['Install', 'Release']"

How to add a new file format#; Adding support for a new file format is a relatively easy process, particularly with Open Babel 2.3 and later. Here are several important steps to remember when developing a format translator:. Create a file for your format in src/formats/ or src/formats/xml/ (for XML-based formats). Ideally, this file is self-contained although several formats modules are compiled across multiple source code files.; Add the name of the new .cpp file to an appropriate place in src/formats/CMakeLists.txt. It will now be compiled as part of the build process.; Take a look at other file format code, particularly exampleformat.cpp, which contains a heavily-annotated description of writing a new format. XML formats need to take a different approach; see the code in xcmlformat.cpp or pubchemformat.cpp.; When reading in molecules (and thus performing a lot of molecular modifications) call :obapi:`OBMol::BeginModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol::BeginModify>` at the beginning and :obapi:`OBMol::EndModify() <OpenBabel::OBMol",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddFileFormat.html:281,Install,Install,281,docs/WritePlugins/AddFileFormat.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/WritePlugins/AddFileFormat.html,2,"['Install', 'Release']","['Install', 'Release']"

User Guide. Python; Introduction. Introduction#; The Python interface to Open Babel is perhaps the most popular of the several languages that Open Babel supports. We provide two Python modules that can be used to access the functionality of Open Babel toolkit:. The openbabel module:. This contains the standard Python bindings automatically generated using SWIG from the C++ API. See The openbabel module. The Pybel module:. This is a light-weight wrapper around the classes and methods in the openbabel module. Pybel provides more convenient and Pythonic ways to access the Open Babel toolkit. See Pybel. You don’t have to choose between them though - they can be used together. previous; Python. next; Install Python bindings. ; ; ; Edit on GitHub; ; ; . ; © Copyright ©2023 The Open Babel Team.; .

The most common type of fingerprint is a series of binary digits (bits) that represent the presence or absence of particular substructures in the molecule. Comparing fingerprints allows you to determine the similarity between two molecules, to find matches to a query substructure, etc.; Open Babel provides several fingerprints of different types:. Fingerprint format: the path-based fingerprint FP2; substructure based fingerprints FP3, FP4 and MACCS; user-defined substructures; Multilevel Neighborhoods of Atoms (MNA) (mna): a circular fingerprint; MolPrint2D format (mpd): a circular fingerprint; Spectrophores™: a fingerprint that encodes the 3D structure of a molecule. The next two sections describe the Fingerprint format and Spectrophores in depth. For the others, see the relevant sections listed above.

The Atom and Molecule classes used by Pybel can be; converted to and from the OBAtom and OBMol used by the; openbabel module. These features are discussed in more detail; below.; The rationale and technical details behind Pybel are described in O’Boyle et al [omh2008]. To support further development of Pybel, please cite this paper if you use Pybel to obtain results for publication.; Information on the Pybel API can be found at the interactive Python; prompt using the help() function. The full API is also listed in; the next section (see Pybel API).; To use Pybel, use from openbabel import pybel. [omh2008]; N.M. O’Boyle, C. Morley and G.R.

User Guide; Stereochemistry. Stereochemistry#; Open Babel stores stereochemistry as the relative arrangement of a set of atoms in space. For example, for a tetrahedral stereocenter, we store information like “looking from atom 2, atoms 4, 5 and 6 are arranged clockwise around atom 3”. This section describes how a user can work with or manipulate this information. This might be useful to invert a particular center, replace a substituent at a stereocenter, enumerate stereoisomers or determine the number of unspecified stereocenters.; Although Open Babel has data structures to support a variety of forms of stereochemistry, currently little use is made of any stereochemistry other than tetrahedral and cis/trans (and square planar to a certain degree).; We will look first of all at how stereochemistry information is stored, accessed, and modified. Then we describe how this information is deduced from the chemical structure. This chapter should be read in combination with the API documentation (see the Stereochemistry overview page found under “Modules”).

When you; type in “Bluegrass John Hartford”, they already know all of the; pages that have “John”, all of the pages with “Hartford”, and all; of the pages with “Bluegrass”.

User Guide; The Open Babel GUI. The Open Babel GUI#; The obabel command line program converts chemical objects (currently molecules or reactions) from one file format to another. The Open Babel graphical user interface (GUI) is an; alternative to using the command line and has the same capabilities. Since Open Babel 2.3, the GUI is available cross-platform on Windows, Linux and MacOSX. On Windows, you can find it in the Start Menu in the Open Babel folder; on Linux and MacOSX, the GUI can be started with the obgui command.; Since the functionality of the GUI mirrors that of obabel, you should consult the previous chapter to learn about available features and how to use them. This chapter describes the general use of the GUI and then focuses on features that are specific to the GUI. Basic operation#; Although the GUI presents many options, the basic operation is straightforward:. Select the type of the type of the input file from the dropdown list.; Click the “…” button and select the file. Its contents are displayed in the textbox below.; Choose the output format and file in a similar way.

Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x#; Open Babel 3.0 breaks the API in a number of cases, and introduces some new behavior behind-the-scenes. These changes were necessary to fix some long standing issues impacting chemical accuracy as well as performance.; Here we describe the main changes, and how to change existing code to adapt. Removal of babel#; The babel executable has been removed, and obabel should be used instead. Essentially obabel is a modern version of babel with additional capabilities and a more standard interface. Typically the only change needed is to place -O before the output filename:; $ babel -ismi tmp.smi -omol out.mol; $ obabel -ismi tmp.smi -omol -O out.mol. Specifically, the differences are as follows:. obabel requires that the output file be specified with a -O option. This is closer to the normal Unix convention for commandline programs, and prevents users accidentally overwriting the input file.; obabel is more flexible when the user needs to ",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html:288,Install,Install,288,docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html,2,"['Install', 'Release']","['Install', 'Release']"

User Guide; Write... Write software using the Open Babel library#; Behind the obabel command line program lies a complete cheminformatics toolkit, the Open Babel library. Using this library, you can write your own custom scripts and software for yourself or others. Note; Any software that uses the Open Babel library must abide by terms of the GNU Public License version 2. This includes all of the supporting language bindings (for example, Python scripts) as well as C++ programs. To summarise, if you are considering distributing your software to other people, you must make your source code available to them on request. Open Babel is a C++ library and can easily be used from C++. In addition it can be accessed from Python, Perl, Ruby, CSharp and Java. These are referred to as language bindings (the Python bindings, etc.) and they were automatically generated from the C++ library using SWIG. For Python we also provide a module (Pybel) that makes it easier to access features of the bindings.

It is a website that illustrates how to program various chemical toolkits to do a set of tasks. To make it easily understandable, these tasks are probably on the simpler side of those in the real world. The Rosetta already contains several examples of using the Open Babel Python bindings to carry out tasks.; Here we focus on the use of the command line application obabel to accomplish the tasks listed in the Rosetta. Inevitably we will struggle with more complicated tasks; however this section is intended to show how far you can go simply using obabel, and to illustrate some of its less common features. Some of the tasks cannot be done exactly as specified, but they are are usually close enough to useful.; Note that except for the examples involving piping, the GUI could also be used.

Energy Efficiency," a low energy conformation. This may be useful as a “clean-up” procedure after an initial 3D structure generation. Note that conformer searching does not alter stereochemistry.; The Open Babel library provides access to several algorithms for conformer searching. All of these algorithms adopt the torsion-driving approach; that is, conformations are generated by setting torsion angles to one of a number of allowed values. The allowed values are listed in the data file torlib.txt; for example, C-C bonds in alkanes have three allowed values: -60, 60 and 180. :obapi:`Systematic Rotor Search <SystematicRotorSearch>`: Systematically; iterate through all possible; conformers according to Open Babel’s torsion library.; This approach is thorough and will; find the global minimum. However as; the number of conformations increases by multiples for each additional; rotational bond, this can take quite a while for molecules with even just; 7 rotatable bonds. This approach scales to the power of N, where N is the; number of rotatable bonds.; :obapi:`Fast Rotor Search <FastRotorSearch>`: This iterates through the; same conformer space as the; SystematicRotorSearch but it greedily optimises the torsion angle at each; rotatable bond in turn, starting from the most central. Thus it scales; linearly with the number of rotatable bonds.; :obapi:`Random Rotor Search <RandomRotorSearch>`: Conformations are; generated by randomly choosing from the allowed torsion angles.; :obapi:`Weighted Rotor Search <WeightedRotorSearch>`: This method uses an; iterative procedure to find a; global minimum. As with the Random Rotor Search, it randomly choses from; the allowed torsion angles but the choice is reweighted based on the energy; of the generated conformer. Over time, the generated conformer for each; step should become increasingly better. For each of these methods, the lowest energy conformation found is selected.

Supported File Formats and Options; Descriptors; Charge models; Release Notes. User Guide; Adding plugins. Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and Martinez, 2007). To add a new plugin of any type, the general method is very simple:. Make a copy of an existing plugin .cpp file; Edit it so that it does what you want; Add the name of the .cpp file to the appropriate CMakeLists.txt. The following sections describe in depth how to add support for a new file format or operation to Open Babel. Remember that if you do add a new plugin, please contribute the code back to the Open Babel project. How to add a new file format; Adding new operations and options; The OBOp class.

To evaluate a molecule’s energy using a forcefield, use the --energy option. The energy is put in an OBPairData object “Energy” which is accessible via an SDF or CML property or --append (to title). Use --ff <forcefield_id> to select a forcefield (default is Ghemical) and --log for a log of the energy calculation. The simplest way to output the energy is as follows:; obabel infile.xxx -otxt --energy --append ""Energy"". To perform forcefield minimization, the --minimize option is used. The following shows typical usage:; obabel infile.xxx -O outfile.yyy --minimize --steps 1500 --sd. The available options are as follows:; --log output a log of the minimization process (default= no log); --crit <converge> set convergence criteria (default=1e-6); --sd use steepest descent algorithm (default = conjugate gradient); --newton use Newton2Num linesearch (default = Simple); --ff <forcefield-id> select a forcefield (default = Ghemical); --steps <number> specify the maximum number of steps (default = 2500); --cut use cut-off (default = don't use cut-off); --rvdw <cutoff> specify the VDW cut-off distance (default = 6.0); --rele <cutoff> specify the Electrostatic cut-off distance (default = 10.0); --freq <steps> specify the frequency to update the non-bonded pairs (default = 10).

Energy Efficiency," standard deviation. In all these cases, normalization is performed on a ‘per-property’ basis, which; means that the data points belonging to the same property set are treated as a; single set and that normalization is only performed on the data points within; each of these sets and not across all data points.; Normalization may be important when comparing the Spectrophores of charged; molecules with those of neutral molecules. For molecules carrying a global; positive charge, the resulting Spectrophore data points of the charge and; electrophilicity properties will both be shifted in absolute value compared to; the corresponding data points of the respective neutral species. Normalization; of the Spectrophores removes the original magnitude differences for the data; points corresponding to the charge and electrophilicity properties of charged; and neutral species. Therefore, if the emphasis of the virtual screening; consists of the identification of molecules with similar property fields without; taking into account differences in absolute charge, then Spectrophores; should be normalized towards zero mean. However, if absolute charge differences; should be taken into account to differentiate between molecules, unnormalized; Spectrophores are recommended. [bll2002]; P. Bultinck, W. Langenaeker, P.

Energy Efficiency," the foundation of chemical; instruction for well over a century.; The valence model is also the foundation of modern chemical; information systems. When a Computer Scientist approaches a; problem, the first task is to figure out a datamodel that; represents the problem to be solved as information. To the; Computer Scientist, the valence model naturally transforms into a; graph, where the nodes are atoms and the edges are bonds.; Computer Scientists know how to manipulate graphs - mathematical; graph theory and computer science have been closely allied since; the invention of the digital computer. There are atoms and space. Everything else is opinion.; —Democritus. However, the valence model of chemistry has many shortcomings. The; most obvious is aromaticity, which quickly required adding the; concept of a non-integral “aromatic” distributed bond, to the; single/double/triple bonds of the simple valence model. And that; was just the start - tautomers, ferrocenes, charged molecules and a; host of other common molecules simply don’t fit the valence model; well.; This complicates life for the computer scientist. As we shall see,; they are the source of most of the complexity of modern; cheminformatics systems. Older systems: Connection Tables#; Most of the early (and some modern) representations of molecules; were in a connection table, literally, a table enumerating the; atoms, and a table enumerating the bonds and which atoms each bond; connected. Here is an example of connection-table (CTAB) portion of; an MDL “SD” file (the data portion is not shown here):; MOLCONV. 3 2 0 0 1 0 1 V2000; 5.9800 -0.0000 -0.0000 Br 0 0 0 0 0 0; 4.4000 -0.6600 0.8300 C 0 0 0 0 0 0; 3.5400 -1.3500 -0.1900 C 0 0 0 0 0 0; 1 2 1 0; 2 3 1 0. This simple example illustrates most of the key features. The; molecule has three atoms, two bonds, and is provided with; three-dimensional (x,y,z) coordinates. MDL provides; extensive documentation; for their various CTFile formats if you are interest",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/Cheminf101/represent.html:2505,charge,charged,2505,docs/Cheminf101/represent.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/Cheminf101/represent.html,2,['charge'],['charged']
Energy Efficiency," you know that the whole molecule is on one; line of a file, it’s easy to parse.; Line notations are also very nice for database applications.; Relational databases have datatypes that, roughly speaking, are; divided into numbers, text, and “everything else”, also known as; “BLOBs” (Binary Large OBjects). You can store line notations in the; “text” fields much more easily than connection tables.; Line notations also have pragmatic advantages. Modern Unix-like; systems (such as UNIX, Linux and Cygwin) have a number of very; powerful “filter” text-processing programs that can be “piped”; together (connected end-to-end) to perform important tasks. For; example, to count the number of molecules containing aliphatic; nitrogen in a SMILES file, I can simply:; grep N file.smi | wc. (grep looks for a particular expression, in this case N, and; prints any line that contains it, and wc (“word count”) counts the; number of words and lines.); This is just a simple example of the power available via “script”; programs using “filters” on Unix-like systems. Unix filters are; much less useful for connection-table formats, because each; molecule is spread over many lines. Query Languages: SMARTS#; In addition to a typographical way to represent molecules, we also; need a way to enter queries about molecules, such as, “Find all; molecules that contain a phenol.”; With text, we’re familiar with the concept of typing a partial; word, such as “ford” to find “Henry Ford” as well as “John; Hartford”. For chemistry, we can also specify partial structures,; and find anything that contains them. For example:. Query; Database; Matches?. YES (matched portion highlighted in blue). NO (double bond indicated doesn’t match). eMolecules, Inc. eMolecules is a one-stop shop for suppliers and information for over 8 million chemical compounds.

Energy Efficiency,"; Since Spectrophore descriptors are dependent on the actual; three-dimensional conformation of the molecule, a typical analysis includes the; calculation of Spectrophores from a reasonable set of different; conformations. It is then up to the user to decide on the most optimal strategy; for processing the different Spectrophore vectors. In a typical virtual; screening application, calculating the average Spectrophore vector from all; conformations of a single molecule may be a good strategy; other applications; have benefit from calculating a weighted average or the minimal values.; For each molecule in the input file, a Spectrophore is calculated and; printed to standard output as a vector of 48 numbers (in the case of a; non-stereospecific Spectrophore. The 48 doubles are organised into 4 sets; of 12 doubles each:. numbers 01-11: Spectrophore values calculated from the atomic partial charges;; numbers 13-24: Spectrophore values calculated from the atomic lipophilicity properties;; numbers 25-36: Spectrophore values calculated from the atomic shape deviations;; numbers 37-48: Spectrophore values calculated from the atomic electrophilicity properties;. Choice of Parameters#. Accuracy#; As already mentioned, the total interaction between cage and molecule for a; given property is minimized by sampling the molecular orientation in angular; steps of a certain magnitude.

User Guide; 3D Structure Generation; Generate... Generate multiple conformers#; In contrast to conformer searching, the goal of conformer generation is not simply to find a low energy conformation but to generate several different conformations. Such conformations may be required by another piece of software such as some protein-ligand docking and pharmacophore programs. They may also be useful if considering writing some sort of shape comparison method.; Open Babel has two distinct conformer generating codes:. Confab: A systematic conformer generator that generates all diverse; low-energy conformers.; Genetic algorithm: This is a stochastic conformer generator that generates; diverse conformers either on an energy or RMSD basis. Genetic algorithm#; A genetic algorithm is a general computational method to find a globally optimum solution to some multiparameter problem. It involves a population of conformers which after a series of generations, iteratively arrive at an optimal solution in terms of either RMSD diversity or energy.; Information about using this method is available at the command-line using: obabel -L conformer. Although labelled as “Conformer Searching”, if you choose the genetic algorithm method (which is the default) then you can save the conformers in the final generation using --writeconformers. For example, the following line creates 30 conformers optimized for RMSD diversity:; obabel startingConformer.mol -O ga_conformers.sdf --conformer --nconf 30; --score rmsd --writeconformers.

Generate multiple conformers#; In contrast to conformer searching, the goal of conformer generation is not simply to find a low energy conformation but to generate several different conformations. Such conformations may be required by another piece of software such as some protein-ligand docking and pharmacophore programs. They may also be useful if considering writing some sort of shape comparison method.; Open Babel has two distinct conformer generating codes:. Confab: A systematic conformer generator that generates all diverse; low-energy conformers.; Genetic algorithm: This is a stochastic conformer generator that generates; diverse conformers either on an energy or RMSD basis. Genetic algorithm#; A genetic algorithm is a general computational method to find a globally optimum solution to some multiparameter problem. It involves a population of conformers which after a series of generations, iteratively arrive at an optimal solution in terms of either RMSD diversity or energy.; Information about using this method is available at the command-line using: obabel -L conformer.

Energy Efficiency,"approach was that the user never needed to consider the implicit hydrogens; their count was calculated based on the explicit atoms (a behavior known as “floating valence”). The disadvantage was that it was difficult for the user to specify non-standard valencies, may have papered-over problems with the data, gave rise to subtle bugs which were not easily addressed and had poorer performance.; As an example of how the behavior has changed, let’s look at creating a bond. If we read the SMILES string C.C, create a bond between the two atoms and write out the SMILES string, we get different answers for OB 2.x (CC) versus OB 3.0 ([CH4][CH4]). OB 2.x just works out the count based on standard valence rules. With OB 3.0, there were four implicit hydrogens on each carbon before we made the bond, and there still are four - they didn’t go anywhere and weren’t automatically adjusted.; While this may seem like a major change, adapting code to handle the change should be straightforward: adding or removing a bond should be accompanied by incrementing or decrementing the implicit hydrogen count by the bond order. This also applies to deleting an atom, since this deletes any bonds connected to it. Note that care should be taken not to set the hydrogen count to a negative value when decrementing.; unsigned int bondorder = 1;; mol->AddBond(1, 2, bondorder);; OBAtom* start = mol->GetAtom(1);; unsigned int hcount = start->GetImplicitHCount();; start->SetImplicitHCount(bondorder >= hcount ? 0 : hcount - bondorder);; OBAtom* end = mol->GetAtom(2);; hcount = end->GetImplicitHCount();; end->SetImplicitHCount(bondorder >= hcount ? 0 : hcount - bondorder);. For the particular case of creating a new atom, it is worth noting that the implicit hydrogen count defaults to zero and that users must set it themselves if necessary. To help with this situation a convenience function has been added to OBAtom that sets the implicit hydrogen count to be consistent with normal valence rules.

Energy Efficiency,"at normalization is only performed on the data points within; each of these sets and not across all data points.; Normalization may be important when comparing the Spectrophores of charged; molecules with those of neutral molecules. For molecules carrying a global; positive charge, the resulting Spectrophore data points of the charge and; electrophilicity properties will both be shifted in absolute value compared to; the corresponding data points of the respective neutral species. Normalization; of the Spectrophores removes the original magnitude differences for the data; points corresponding to the charge and electrophilicity properties of charged; and neutral species. Therefore, if the emphasis of the virtual screening; consists of the identification of molecules with similar property fields without; taking into account differences in absolute charge, then Spectrophores; should be normalized towards zero mean. However, if absolute charge differences; should be taken into account to differentiate between molecules, unnormalized; Spectrophores are recommended. [bll2002]; P. Bultinck, W. Langenaeker, P.

Updating to Open Babel 3.0 from 2.x#; Open Babel 3.0 breaks the API in a number of cases, and introduces some new behavior behind-the-scenes. These changes were necessary to fix some long standing issues impacting chemical accuracy as well as performance.; Here we describe the main changes, and how to change existing code to adapt. Removal of babel#; The babel executable has been removed, and obabel should be used instead. Essentially obabel is a modern version of babel with additional capabilities and a more standard interface. Typically the only change needed is to place -O before the output filename:; $ babel -ismi tmp.smi -omol out.mol; $ obabel -ismi tmp.smi -omol -O out.mol. Specifically, the differences are as follows:. obabel requires that the output file be specified with a -O option. This is closer to the normal Unix convention for commandline programs, and prevents users accidentally overwriting the input file.; obabel is more flexible when the user needs to specify parameter values on options. For instance, the --unique option can be used with or without a parameter (specifying the criteria used). With babel, this only works when the option is the last on the line; with obabel, no such restriction applies. Because of the original design of babel, it is not possi",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html:1344,adapt,adapt,1344,docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/UseTheLibrary/migration.html,2,['adapt'],['adapt']

User Guide; Molecular... Molecular Mechanics and Force Fields#; Used by a number of features, such as 3D coordinate generation,; conformer searching, etc., Open Babel provides support for a variety; of all-atom molecular mechanics force fields. The key idea is to use; classical mechanics to rapidly simulate molecular systems.; Each force field method is parameterized for a set of possible; molecules (e.g., proteins, organic molecules, etc.), building in; assumptions about how various aspects of the molecules contribute to; the overall potential energy.; The total potential energy of the system is usually given as a sum of; multiple components, including some or all of (but not limited to):. Bond stretching; Angle bending; Dihedral torsions; Out-of-plane bending; Van der Waals repulsion; Atomic partial charges (electrostatic). Open Babel supports several force field methods. In general, we; recommend use of either the Generalized Amber Force Field (gaff) or; MMFF94 Force Field (mmff94) for organic molecules, and the; Universal Force Field (uff) for other types of molecules.

Energy Efficiency,"d a new descriptor. Supported File Formats and Options; Descriptors; Charge models; Release Notes. User Guide; Adding plugins. Adding plugins#; Open Babel uses a plugin architecture for file formats, ‘operations’, charge models, forcefields, fingerprints and descriptors. The general idea behind plugins is described on Wikipedia. When you start an application that uses the Open Babel library, it searches for available plugins and loads them. This means, for example, that plugins could be distributed separately to the Open Babel distribution.; In fact, even the plugin types are themselves plugins; this makes it easy to add new categories of plugin. The different types of plugins can be listed using:; C:\>babel -L; charges; descriptors; fingerprints; forcefields; formats; loaders; ops. To list the plugins of a particular type, for example, charge models, just specify the plugin type:; C:\>babel -L charges; gasteiger Assign Gasteiger-Marsili sigma partial charges; mmff94 Assign MMFF94 partial charges; qeq Assign QEq (charge equilibration) partial charges (Rappe and Goddard, 199; 1); qtpie Assign QTPIE (charge transfer, polarization and equilibration) partial; charges (Chen and Martinez, 2007). To add a new plugin of any type, the general method is very simple:. Make a copy of an existing plugin .cpp file; Edit it so that it does what you want; Add the name of the .cpp file to the appropriate CMakeLists.txt. The following sections describe in depth how to add support for a new file format or operation to Open Babel. Remember that if you do add a new plugin, please contribute the code back to the Open Babel project. How to add a new file format; Adding new operations and options; The OBOp class.

Energy Efficiency,"d, this can take quite a while for molecules with even just; 7 rotatable bonds. This approach scales to the power of N, where N is the; number of rotatable bonds.; :obapi:`Fast Rotor Search <FastRotorSearch>`: This iterates through the; same conformer space as the; SystematicRotorSearch but it greedily optimises the torsion angle at each; rotatable bond in turn, starting from the most central. Thus it scales; linearly with the number of rotatable bonds.; :obapi:`Random Rotor Search <RandomRotorSearch>`: Conformations are; generated by randomly choosing from the allowed torsion angles.; :obapi:`Weighted Rotor Search <WeightedRotorSearch>`: This method uses an; iterative procedure to find a; global minimum. As with the Random Rotor Search, it randomly choses from; the allowed torsion angles but the choice is reweighted based on the energy; of the generated conformer. Over time, the generated conformer for each; step should become increasingly better. For each of these methods, the lowest energy conformation found is selected. In some cases, the entire set of conformations generated is also available. Many; of these methods include an option to optimize the geometry of conformations; during the search. This greatly slows down the procedure but may produce more; accurate results.; The choice of which algorithm to use depends on the speed/accuracy tradeoff with; which you are happy, and also on the number of rotatable bonds in the molecule.; Are you looking for a reasonable structure for 3D display? Or are you looking; for a structure close to the global minimum?; To use from obabel, see the help for the conformer operation (obabel -L conformer). This operation is used both for conformer searching and for the genetic algorithm conformer generation described below.; Here is an example of use from Python:; >>> ff = ob.OBForceField.FindForceField(""mmff94""); >>> ff.Setup(obmol); True; >>> print(ff.Energy()); 15.179054202; >>> ff.SystematicRotorSearch(100); >>> print(ff.Energy",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/3DStructureGen/SingleConformer.html:4164,energy,energy,4164,docs/3DStructureGen/SingleConformer.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/3DStructureGen/SingleConformer.html,2,['energy'],['energy']

SMILES format (smi, smiles)#; A linear text format which can describe the connectivity and chirality of a molecule; Open Babel implements the OpenSMILES specification.; It also implements an extension to this specification for radicals.; Note that the l <atomno> option, used to specify a “last” atom, is; intended for the generation of SMILES strings to which additional atoms; will be concatenated. If the atom specified has an explicit H within a bracket; (e.g. [nH] or [C@@H]) the output will have the H removed along with any; associated stereo symbols.

SMILES format using Smiley parser (smy)#; The Smiley parser presents an alternative to the standard SMILES parser; (SMILES format (smi, smiles)). It was written to be strictly compatible with the; OpenSMILES standard (http://opensmiles.org). In comparison, the standard; parser is more forgiving to erroneous input, and also supports some extensions; such as for radicals.; In addition, the Smiley parser returns detailed error messages when problems; arise parsing or validating the SMILES, whereas the standard parser seldom; describes the specific problem. For a detailed description of the OpenSMILES; semantics, the specification should be consulted. In addition to syntactical; and grammatical correctness, the Smiley parser also verifies some basic; semantics.; Here are some examples of the errors reported:; SyntaxError: Bracket atom expression contains invalid trailing characters.; F.FB(F)F.[NH2+251][C@@H](CP(c1c",MatchSource.WIKI,openbabel,openbabel,openbabel-3-1-1,http://openbabel.org//docs/FileFormats/SMILES_format_using_Smiley_parser.html:1518,Charge,Charge,1518,docs/FileFormats/SMILES_format_using_Smiley_parser.html,http://openbabel.org/,http://openbabel.org//docs/FileFormats/SMILES_format_using_Smiley_parser.html,1,['Charge'],['Charge']
