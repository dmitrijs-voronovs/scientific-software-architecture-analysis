To remove an individual module from a JITDylib it must first be added using an; explicit ``ResourceTracker``. The module can then be removed by calling; ``ResourceTracker::remove``:. .. code-block:: c++. auto &JD = ... ;; auto M = ... ;. auto RT = JD.createResourceTracker();; Layer.add(RT, std::move(M)); // Add M to JD, tracking resources with RT. RT.remove(); // Remove M from JD. Modules added directly to a JITDylib will be tracked by that JITDylib's default; resource tracker. All code can be removed from a JITDylib by calling ``JITDylib::clear``. This; leaves the cleared JITDylib in an empty but usable state. JITDylibs can be removed by calling ``ExecutionSession::removeJITDylib``. This; clears the JITDylib and then puts it into a defunct state. No further operations; can be performed on the JITDylib, and it will be destroyed as soon as the last; handle to it is released. An example of how to use the resource management APIs can be found at; ``llvm/examples/OrcV2Examples/LLJITRemovableCode``. How to add the support for custom program representation; --------------------------------------------------------; In order to add the support for a custom program representation, a custom ``MaterializationUnit``; for the program representation, and a custom ``Layer`` are needed. The Layer will have two; operations: ``add`` and ``emit``. The ``add`` operation takes an instance of your program; representation, builds one of your custom ``MaterializationUnits`` to hold it, then adds it; to a ``JITDylib``. The emit operation takes a ``MaterializationResponsibility`` object and an; instance of your program representation and materializes it, usually by compiling it and handing; the resulting object off to an ``ObjectLinkingLayer``.

Assembling a Toolchain:; =======================. The procedure is:. # Build an LLVM toolchain with support for Windows Itanium.; # Use the toolchain from step 1. to build libc++, libc++abi, and libunwind. It is also possible to cross-compile from Linux. One method of building the libraries in step 2. is to build them ""stand-alone"".; A stand-alone build doesn't involve the rest of the LLVM tree. The steps are:. * ``cd build-dir``; * ``cmake -DLLVM_PATH=<path to llvm checkout e.g. /llvm-project/> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install path> <other options> <path to project e.g. /llvm-project/libcxxabi>``; * ``<make program e.g. ninja>``; * ``<make program> install``. More information on standalone builds can be found in the build documentation for; the respective libraries. The next section discuss the salient options and modifications; required for building and installing the libraries using standalone builds. This assumes; that we are building libunwind and ibc++ as DLLs and statically linking libc++abi into; libc++. Other build configurations are possible, but they are not discussed here. Common CMake configuration options:; -----------------------------------. * ``-D_LIBCPP_ABI_FORCE_ITANIUM'``. Tell the libc++ headers that the Itanium C++ ABI is being used. * ``-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=""-lmsvcrt -llegacy_stdio_definitions -D_NO_CRT_STDIO_INLINE""``.

Deployability,"DISCOVERY; --------------. The inputs passed to :program:`lit` can be either individual tests, or entire; directories or hierarchies of tests to run. When :program:`lit` starts up, the; first thing it does is convert the inputs into a complete list of tests to run; as part of *test discovery*. In the :program:`lit` model, every test must exist inside some *test suite*.; :program:`lit` resolves the inputs specified on the command line to test suites; by searching upwards from the input path until it finds a :file:`lit.cfg` or; :file:`lit.site.cfg` file. These files serve as both a marker of test suites; and as configuration files which :program:`lit` loads in order to understand; how to find and run the tests inside the test suite. Once :program:`lit` has mapped the inputs into test suites it traverses the; list of inputs adding tests for individual files and recursively searching for; tests in directories. This behavior makes it easy to specify a subset of tests to run, while still; allowing the test suite configuration to control exactly how tests are; interpreted. In addition, :program:`lit` always identifies tests by the test; suite they are in, and their relative path inside the test suite. For; appropriately configured projects, this allows :program:`lit` to provide; convenient and flexible support for out-of-tree builds. .. _test-status-results:.

This is used for test formats which allow; specifying that a test does not currently work, but wish to leave it in the test; suite. **XPASS**. The test succeeded, but it was expected to fail.

I've updated the documentation to include load store and allocation; instructions (please take a look and let me know if I'm on the right; track):. file:/home/vadve/lattner/llvm/docs/LangRef.html#memoryops. I have a couple of concerns I would like to bring up:. 1. Reference types; Right now, I've spec'd out the language to have a pointer type, which; works fine for lots of stuff... except that Java really has; references: constrained pointers that cannot be manipulated: added and; subtracted, moved, etc... Do we want to have a type like this? It; could be very nice for analysis (pointer always points to the start of; an object, etc...) and more closely matches Java semantics. The; pointer type would be kept for C++ like semantics. Through analysis,; C++ pointers could be promoted to references in the LLVM; representation. 2. Our ""implicit"" memory references in assembly language:; After thinking about it, this model has two problems:; A. If you do pointer analysis and realize that two stores are; independent and can share the same memory source object, there is; no way to represent this in either the bytecode or assembly.; B. When parsing assembly/bytecode, we effectively have to do a full; SSA generation/PHI node insertion pass to build the dependencies; when we don't want the ""pinned"" representation. This is not; cool.; I'm tempted to make memory references explicit in both the assembly and; bytecode to get around this... what do you think?. -Chris.

Deployability,"Deploying the Virtual Analysis Facility; =======================================. Introduction; ------------. Thanks to CernVM and PROOF on Demand, it is possible to deploy a ready; to use Virtual Analysis Facility on your cloud (either public, private; or even your desktop computer). On the server side, ""configuring"" the Virtual Analysis Facility is; simply a matter of starting a certain number of CernVM virtual machines; that will become part of your PROOF cluster. CernVM uses; contextualization to specialize each virtual machine to be either a head; node or a worker node. The Virtual Analysis Facility comes with many preconfigured things:. - a HTCondor cluster capable of running PROOF on Demand. - certificate authentication. - your experiment's software (if available on CernVM-FS). Obtain the CernVM image and contextualization; ---------------------------------------------. ### Download the CernVM bare image. The Virtual Analysis Facility currently works with *CernVM Batch 2.7.1; 64-bit*. This means that you need to have this CernVM image available; either on your local hard disk (in case of a desktop deployment) or in; your cloud's image repository. > For convenience we provide the direct link for the working versions:; >; > - [CernVM 2.7.1 batch 64-bit for; > **KVM**](https://cernvm.cern.ch/releases/19/cernvm-batch-node-2.7.1-2-3-x86_64.hdd.gz); >; > - [CernVM 2.7.1 batch 64-bit for; > **Xen**](https://cernvm.cern.ch/releases/19/cernvm-batch-node-2.7.1-2-3-x86_64.ext3.gz); >; > Images are gzipped. In most cases you'll need to gunzip them before; > registering to your image repository. ### Create VM configuration profiles. CernVM images are base images supporting boot-time customization via; configuration profiles called ""contexts"".

Build option descriptions have been updated to indicate which builtins require; an active network connection during the build. You can inspect the list of; options and their descriptions by running `cmake -LH $PWD` in the build; directory. The build system has been updated to remove most file globbing to improve; the reliability of incremental builds when source files are added or removed. A new check has been added to make ROOT fail during the configuration step; if incompatible versions of the Python interpreter and its libraries are; selected. The `all=ON` option now tries to enable more options. Some options had their; default value toggled to disabled, which affected `all=ON`. Now all options; are listed explicitly so that they are enabled regardless of their default; value. ### Builtins. The following builtins had their versions updated for this release:. * VecCore 0.5.2; * Vc 1.4.1; * XRootD 4.8.5; * OpenSSL 1.0.2q; * PCRE 8.42. ### Header location and `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` / `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`. A change in the argument handling of `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` and `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` might need your attention:; these macros now respect whether a header file was passed with its full relative path (the common case), or with a full path.; The latter allows to find headers at runtime - at the cost of a loss of relocatability: you cannot move the library containing; that dictionary to a different directory, because the header location is stored in the dictionary. This case is used by roottest; but should likely not be used by anything but test suites. Instead pass relative paths, together with a `-I` option to find the headers, plus setting `ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH` for finding the; headers back at runtime. The ROOT stress suite is now updated to follow this behavior; see for instance",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v618/index.md:23402,update,updated,23402,README/ReleaseNotes/v618/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v618/index.md,2,"['release', 'update']","['release', 'updated']"

As a result, the new ``compile_commands.json`` file should appear in the; current directory. You should link it to the LLVM source tree so that; Clang Tooling is able to use it:. .. code-block:: console. $ ln -s $PWD/compile_commands.json path/to/llvm/source/. Now you are ready to build and test LLVM using make:. .. code-block:: console. $ make check-all. Setup Clang Tooling Using CMake on Windows; ==========================================. For Windows developers, the Visual Studio project generators in CMake do; not support `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS; <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html>`_.; However, the Ninja generator does support this variable and can be used; on Windows to generate a suitable ``compile_commands.json`` that invokes; the MSVC compiler. First, you will need to install `Ninja`_. Once installed, the Ninja; executable will need to be in your search path for CMake to locate it. Next, assuming you already have Visual Studio installed on your machine, you; need to have the appropriate environment variables configured so that CMake; will locate the MSVC compiler for the Ninja generator. The `documentation; <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#path_and_environment>`_; describes the necessary environment variable settings, but the simplest thing; is to use a `developer command-prompt window; <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#developer_command_prompt_shortcuts>`_; or call a `developer command file; <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170#developer_command_file_locations>`_; to set the environment variables appropriately. Now you can run CMake with the Ninja generator to export a compilation; database",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.rst:2469,install,install,2469,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/HowToSetupToolingForLLVM.rst,1,['install'],['install']

I agree to some extent, but it also comes at the; > cost of verbosity. And when the types are obvious from people's; > experience (e.g., in the br instruction), it doesn't seem to help as; > much. Very true. We should discuss this more, but my reasoning is more of a; consistency argument. There are VERY few instructions that can have all; of the types eliminated, and doing so when available unnecessarily makes; the language more difficult to handle. Especially when you see 'int; %this' and 'bool %that' all over the place, I think it would be; disorienting to see:. br %predicate, %iftrue, %iffalse. for branches. Even just typing that once gives me the creeps. ;) Like I; said, we should probably discuss this further in person... > On reflection, I really like your idea of having the two different; > switch types (even though they encode implementation techniques rather; > than semantics). It should simplify building the CFG and my guess is it; > could enable some significant optimizations, though we should think; > about which. Great. I added a note to the switch section commenting on how the VM; should just use the instruction type as a hint, and that the; implementation may choose altermate representations (such as predicated; branches). > In the lookup-indirect form of the switch, is there a reason not to; > make the val-type uint?.

Deployability,"GOAL:. Provide http interface to arbitrary ROOT application. USAGE:. At any place of the code create http server:. root [0] serv = new THttpServer. By default, civetweb web server with port number 8080 will be started.; It gets access to files, canvases and trees, registered in gROOT.; One additionally could register other objects to the server:. root [1] serv->Register(""abc/fold1"", hpx);; root [2] serv->Register(""abc/fold2"", hpxpy);; root [3] serv->Register(""extra"", c1);. Once server running, just open in any browser page: http://yourhost:8080. Example macro: $ROOTSYS/tutorials/http/httpserver.C. FAST CGI:. Instead of running http server, one could use fast cgi interface; to normal web server like Apache or lighttpd or any other.; When creating server, one could specify:. root [0] serv = new THttpServer(""fastcgi:9000"");. This opens port 9000, which should be specified in web server configuration.; For instance, lighttpd.conf file could contain path like this:. fastcgi.server = (; ""/remote_scripts/"" =>; (( ""host"" => ""192.168.1.10"",; ""port"" => 9000,; ""check-local"" => ""disable"",; ""docroot"" => ""/""; )); ).

Deployability,"GS`` above. Running CMake and Building; --------------------------. Finally, if you're using your platform compiler, run:. .. code-block:: bash. $ cmake -G Ninja <source-dir> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<type> <options above>. If you're using Clang as the cross-compiler, run:. .. code-block:: bash. $ CC='clang' CXX='clang++' cmake -G Ninja <source-dir> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<type> <options above>. If you have ``clang``/``clang++`` on the path, it should just work, and special; Ninja files will be created in the build directory. I strongly suggest; you to run ``cmake`` on a separate build directory, *not* inside the; source tree. To build, simply type:. .. code-block:: bash. $ ninja. It should automatically find out how many cores you have, what are; the rules that needs building and will build the whole thing. You can't run ``ninja check-all`` on this tree because the created; binaries are targeted to ARM, not x86_64. Installing and Using; --------------------. After the LLVM/Clang has built successfully, you should install it; via:. .. code-block:: bash. $ ninja install. which will create a sysroot on the install-dir. You can then tar; that directory into a binary with the full triple name (for easy; identification), like:. .. code-block:: bash. $ ln -sf <install-dir> arm-linux-gnueabihf-clang; $ tar zchf arm-linux-gnueabihf-clang.tar.gz arm-linux-gnueabihf-clang. If you copy that tarball to your target board, you'll be able to use; it for running the test-suite, for example. Follow the guidelines at; https://llvm.org/docs/lnt/quickstart.html, unpack the tarball in the; test directory, and use options:. .. code-block:: bash. $ ./sandbox/bin/python sandbox/bin/lnt runtest nt \; --sandbox sandbox \; --test-suite `pwd`/test-suite \; --cc `pwd`/arm-linux-gnueabihf-clang/bin/clang \; --cxx `pwd`/arm-linux-gnueabihf-clang/bin/clang++.

Deployability,"H` for finding the; headers back at runtime. The ROOT stress suite is now updated to follow this behavior; see for instance the injection of; `$ROOTSYS/test` in `test/stressMathCore.cxx`, allowing ROOT to find the header at runtime, whether interpreted; (`R__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH`) or compiled (`TROOT::AddExtraInterpreterArgs({""-I...""})` before interpreter construction). If you called `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/subdir/Header1.h LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` then update that; call to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict Header1.h OPTIONS -I subdir LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` *if* the header is usually included as; `#include ""Header1.h""`, or to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict subdir/Header1.h LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` *if* the header is usually; included as `#include ""subdir/Header1.h""`. I.e. the general rule is: pass to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` (or; `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`) the spelling as `#include`ed. As an important side-effect, `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` and thus `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` now *require* the header to; be found at configuration time. We have seen too many cases where the header location was mis-stated, and as a consequence,; CMake did not generate the proper dependencies. If the header should not be taken into account for dependencies and / or if; the header will not be found (e.g. the standard library's `vector`) please pass the header through the `NODEPHEADERS` option; to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` or `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`.

If dead code stripping is enabled then the; linker collects the list of live symbols. Phase 3 : Optimize Bitcode Files; --------------------------------. After symbol resolution, the linker tells the LTO shared object which symbols; are needed by native object files. In the example above, the linker reports; that only ``foo1()`` is used by native object files using; ``lto_codegen_add_must_preserve_symbol()``. Next the linker invokes the LLVM; optimizer and code generators using ``lto_codegen_compile()`` which returns a; native object file creating by merging the LLVM bitcode files and applying; various optimization passes. Phase 4 : Symbol Resolution after optimization; ----------------------------------------------. In this phase, the linker reads optimized a native object file and updates the; internal global symbol table to reflect any changes. The linker also collects; information about any changes in use of external symbols by LLVM bitcode; files. In the example above, the linker notes that ``foo4()`` is not used any; more. If dead code stripping is enabled then the linker refreshes the live; symbol information appropriately and performs dead code stripping. After this phase, the linker continues linking as if it never saw LLVM bitcode; files. .. _libLTO:. ``libLTO``; ==========. ``libLTO`` is a shared object that is part of the LLVM tools, and is intended; for use by a linker. ``libLTO`` provides an abstract C interface to use the LLVM; interprocedural optimizer without exposing details of LLVM's internals.

Deployability,"LLVM Documentation; ==================. LLVM's documentation is written in reStructuredText, a lightweight; plaintext markup language (file extension `.rst`). While the; reStructuredText documentation should be quite readable in source form, it; is mostly meant to be processed by the Sphinx documentation generation; system to create HTML pages which are hosted on <https://llvm.org/docs/> and; updated after every commit. Manpage output is also supported, see below. If you instead would like to generate and view the HTML locally, install; Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/> and then do:. cd <build-dir>; cmake -DLLVM_ENABLE_SPHINX=true -DSPHINX_OUTPUT_HTML=true <src-dir>; make -j3 docs-llvm-html; $BROWSER <build-dir>/docs/html/index.html. The mapping between reStructuredText files and generated documentation is; `docs/Foo.rst` <-> `<build-dir>/docs//html/Foo.html` <-> `https://llvm.org/docs/Foo.html`. If you are interested in writing new documentation, you will want to read; `SphinxQuickstartTemplate.rst` which will get you writing documentation; very fast and includes examples of the most important reStructuredText; markup syntax. Manpage Output; ===============. Building the manpages is similar to building the HTML documentation. The; primary difference is to use the `man` makefile target, instead of the; default (which is `html`). Sphinx then produces the man pages in the; directory `<build-dir>/docs/man/`. cd <build-dir>; cmake -DLLVM_ENABLE_SPHINX=true -DSPHINX_OUTPUT_MAN=true <src-dir>; make -j3 docs-llvm-man; man -l <build-dir>/docs/man/FileCheck.1. The correspondence between .rst files and man pages is; `docs/CommandGuide/Foo.rst` <-> `<build-dir>/docs//man/Foo.1`.; These .rst files are also included during HTML generation so they are also; viewable online (as noted above) at e.g.; `https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/Foo.html`.

Deployability,"LLVM NVPTX target.; The library can be found under ``nvvm/libdevice/`` in the CUDA Toolkit and; there is a separate version for each compute architecture. For a list of all math functions implemented in libdevice, see; `libdevice Users Guide <http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/libdevice-users-guide/index.html>`_. To accommodate various math-related compiler flags that can affect code; generation of libdevice code, the library code depends on a special LLVM IR; pass (``NVVMReflect``) to handle conditional compilation within LLVM IR. This; pass looks for calls to the ``@__nvvm_reflect`` function and replaces them; with constants based on the defined reflection parameters. Such conditional; code often follows a pattern:. .. code-block:: c++. float my_function(float a) {; if (__nvvm_reflect(""FASTMATH"")); return my_function_fast(a);; else; return my_function_precise(a);; }. The default value for all unspecified reflection parameters is zero. The ``NVVMReflect`` pass should be executed early in the optimization; pipeline, immediately after the link stage. The ``internalize`` pass is also; recommended to remove unused math functions from the resulting PTX. For an; input IR module ``module.bc``, the following compilation flow is recommended:. 1. Save list of external functions in ``module.bc``; 2. Link ``module.bc`` with ``libdevice.compute_XX.YY.bc``; 3. Internalize all functions not in list from (1); 4. Eliminate all unused internal functions; 5. Run ``NVVMReflect`` pass; 6. Run standard optimization pipeline. .. note::. ``linkonce`` and ``linkonce_odr`` linkage types are not suitable for the; libdevice functions. It is possible to link two IR modules that have been; linked against libdevice using different reflection variables. Since the ``NVVMReflect`` pass replaces conditionals with constants, it will; often leave behind dead code of the form:. .. code-block:: llvm. entry:; ..; br i1 true, label %foo, label %bar; foo:; ..; bar:; ; Dead code; ..

Deployability,"LVM emits stack map data into the object code within a designated; :ref:`stackmap-section`. This stack map data contains a record for; each stack map. The record stores the stack map's instruction address; and contains an entry for each mapped value. Each entry encodes a; value's location as a register, stack offset, or constant. A patch point is an instruction address at which space is reserved for; patching a new instruction sequence at run time. Patch points look; much like calls to LLVM. They take arguments that follow a calling; convention and may return a value. They also imply stack map; generation, which allows the runtime to locate the patchpoint and; find the location of ``live values`` at that point. Motivation; ==========. This functionality is currently experimental but is potentially useful; in a variety of settings, the most obvious being a runtime (JIT); compiler. Example applications of the patchpoint intrinsics are; implementing an inline call cache for polymorphic method dispatch or; optimizing the retrieval of properties in dynamically typed languages; such as JavaScript. The intrinsics documented here are currently used by the JavaScript; compiler within the open source WebKit project, see the `FTL JIT; <https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/FTLJIT>`_, but they are designed to be; used whenever stack maps or code patching are needed. Because the; intrinsics have experimental status, compatibility across LLVM; releases is not guaranteed. The stack map functionality described in this document is separate; from the functionality described in; :ref:`stack-map`. `GCFunctionMetadata` provides the location of; pointers into a collected heap captured by the `GCRoot` intrinsic,; which can also be considered a ""stack map"". Unlike the stack maps; defined above, the `GCFunctionMetadata` stack map interface does not; provide a way to associate live register values of arbitrary type with; an instruction address, nor does it specify a format for the resulting; stack ma",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst:1703,patch,patchpoint,1703,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,1,['patch'],['patchpoint']

Due to limitations with; ``fast_filter_branch.py``, unannotated tags cannot be renamed; (``fast_filter_branch.py`` considers them branches, not tags). Since; the upstream monorepo had its tags rewritten with an ""llvmorg-""; prefix, name conflicts should not be an issue. ``--tag-prefix`` can; be used to more clearly indicate which tags correspond to various; imported repositories.

Clang provides a collection of CMake; cache scripts to make these features more approachable. CMake cache files are utilized using CMake's -C flag:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -C <path to cache file> <path to sources>. CMake cache scripts are processed in an isolated scope, only cached variables; remain set when the main configuration runs. CMake cached variables do not reset; variables that are already set unless the FORCE option is specified. A few notes about CMake Caches:. - Order of command line arguments is important. - -D arguments specified before -C are set before the cache is processed and; can be read inside the cache file; - -D arguments specified after -C are set after the cache is processed and; are unset inside the cache file. - All -D arguments will override cache file settings; - CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE is evaluated after both the cache file and the command; line arguments; - It is recommended that all -D options should be specified *before* -C.

This similarly; applies for the other IR types, and in some cases can even affect the quality; of optimization. For example, running all loop passes on a loop may cause a; later loop to be able to be optimized more than if each loop pass were run; separately. Inserting Passes into Default Pipelines; =======================================. Rather than manually adding passes to a pass manager, the typical way of; creating a pass manager is to use a ``PassBuilder`` and call something like; ``PassBuilder::buildPerModuleDefaultPipeline()`` which creates a typical; pipeline for a given optimization level. Sometimes either frontends or backends will want to inject passes into the; pipeline. For example, frontends may want to add instrumentation, and target; backends may want to add passes that lower custom intrinsics. For these; cases, ``PassBuilder`` exposes callbacks that allow injecting passes into; certain parts of the pipeline. For example,. .. code-block:: c++. PassBuilder PB;; PB.registerPipelineStartEPCallback([&](ModulePassManager &MPM,; PassBuilder::OptimizationLevel Level) {; MPM.addPass(FooPass());; };. will add ``FooPass`` near the very beginning of the pipeline for pass; managers created by that ``PassBuilder``. See the documentation for; ``PassBuilder`` for the various places that passes can be added. If a ``PassBuilder`` has a corresponding ``TargetMachine`` for a backend, it; will call ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` to allow the; backend to inject passes into the pipeline. Clang's ``BackendUtil.cpp`` shows examples of a frontend adding (mostly; sanitizer) passes to various parts of the pipelin",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst:5368,pipeline,pipeline,5368,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

This file is available in two different locations. * ``<LLVM_INSTALL_PACKAGE_DIR>/LLVMConfig.cmake`` where; ``<LLVM_INSTALL_PACKAGE_DIR>`` is the location where LLVM CMake modules are; installed as part of an installed version of LLVM. This is typically; ``cmake/llvm/`` within the lib directory. On Linux, this is typically; ``/usr/lib/cmake/llvm/LLVMConfig.cmake``. * ``<LLVM_BUILD_ROOT>/lib/cmake/llvm/LLVMConfig.cmake`` where; ``<LLVM_BUILD_ROOT>`` is the root of the LLVM build tree. **Note: this is only; available when building LLVM with CMake.**. If LLVM is installed in your operating system's normal installation prefix (e.g.; on Linux this is usually ``/usr/``) ``find_package(LLVM ...)`` will; automatically find LLVM if it is installed correctly. If LLVM is not installed; or you wish to build directly against the LLVM build tree you can use; ``LLVM_DIR`` as previously mentioned. The ``LLVMConfig.cmake`` file sets various useful variables.

The minimum required version of CMake has been updated to 3.9 or newer to be; able to take advantage of new features such as native support for the CUDA; language, among other things. Please refer to CMake's release notes for further; information. The method to select the C++ standard has changed. Now the recommended way; to select the C++ standard is via the option `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=XX`, which; is the idiomatic way to do it in CMake. The old options still work, but have; been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Build option descriptions have been updated to indicate which builtins require; an active network connection during the build. You can inspect the list of; options and their descriptions by running `cmake -LH $PWD` in the build; directory. The build system has been updated to remove most file globbing to improve; the reliability of incremental builds when source files are added or removed. A new check has been added to make ROOT fail during the configuration step; if incompatible versions of the Python interpreter and its libraries are; selected. The `all=ON` option now tries to enable more options. Some options had their; default value toggled to disabled, which affected `all=ON`. Now all options; are listed explicitly so that they are enabled regardless of their default; value. ### Builtins. The following builtins had their versions updated for this release:. * VecCore 0.5.2; * Vc 1.4.1; * XRootD 4.8.5; * OpenSSL 1.0.2q; * PCRE 8.42. ### Header location and `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` / `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`.

You get the idea. In the past, asserts were used to indicate a piece of code that should not be; reached. These were typically of the form:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(0 && ""Invalid radix for integer literal"");.

Today, we have something much better: ``llvm_unreachable``:. .. code-block:: c++. llvm_unreachable(""Invalid radix for integer literal"");. When assertions are enabled, this will print the message if it's ever reached; and then exit the program. When assertions are disabled (i.e. in release; builds), ``llvm_unreachable`` becomes a hint to compilers to skip generating; code for this branch. If the compiler does not support this, it will fall back; to the ""abort"" implementation. Use ``llvm_unreachable`` to mark a specific point in code that should never be; reached. This is especially desirable for addressing warnings about unreachable; branches, etc., but can be used whenever reaching a particular code path is; unconditionally a bug (not originating from user input; see below) of some kind.; Use of ``assert`` should always include a testable predicate (as opposed to; ``assert(false)``). If the error condition can be triggered by user input then the; recoverable error mechanism described in :doc:`ProgrammersManual` should be; used instead. In cases where this is not practical, ``report_fatal_error`` may; be used. Another issue is that values used only by assertions will produce an ""unused; value"" warning when assertions are disabled.

Deployability,"ProcessControl: Improvements to in-tree support for out-of-process; execution**. The ``TargetProcessControl`` API provides various operations on the JIT; target process (the one which will execute the JIT'd code), including; memory allocation, memory writes, function execution, and process queries; (e.g. for the target triple). By targeting this API new components can be; developed which will work equally well for in-process and out-of-process; JITing. 2. **ORC RPC based TargetProcessControl implementation**. An ORC RPC based implementation of the ``TargetProcessControl`` API is; currently under development to enable easy out-of-process JITing via; file descriptors / sockets. 3. **Core State Machine Cleanup**. The core ORC state machine is currently implemented between JITDylib and; ExecutionSession. Methods are slowly being moved to `ExecutionSession`. This; will tidy up the code base, and also allow us to support asynchronous removal; of JITDylibs (in practice deleting an associated state object in; ExecutionSession and leaving the JITDylib instance in a defunct state until; all references to it have been released). Near Future Work; ----------------. 1. **ORC JIT Runtime Libraries**. We need a runtime library for JIT'd code. This would include things like; TLS registration, reentry functions, registration code for language runtimes; (e.g. Objective C and Swift) and other JIT specific runtime code. This should; be built in a similar manner to compiler-rt (possibly even as part of it). 2. **Remote jit_dlopen / jit_dlclose**. To more fully mimic the environment that static programs operate in we would; like JIT'd code to be able to ""dlopen"" and ""dlclose"" JITDylibs, running all of; their initializers/deinitializers on the current thread. This would require; support from the runtime library described above. 3. **Debugging support**. ORC currently supports the GDBRegistrationListener API when using RuntimeDyld; as the underlying JIT linker.

There are several ways of obtaining `PyROOT`, and which is best depends; on your specific situation. If you work at CERN, you can use the; installation available on `afs`. Otherwise, you will want to build from; source, as `PyROOT` is not build by default in the binaries distributed; from the ROOT project site. If you download the ROOT binaries, take care; to download and install the Python distribution from; <http://www.python.org/> against which they were built. #### Environment Settings. ROOT installations with the build of `PyROOT` enabled are available from; the CERN `afs` cell `/afs/cern.ch/sw/root/<version>/<platform>`. To use; them, simply modify your shell environment accordingly. For Unix:. `export PATH=$ROOTSYS/bin:$PYTHONDIR/bin:$PATH`. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. `export PYTHONPATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONPATH`. For Windows:. `set PATH=%ROOTSYS%/bin;%PYTHONDIR%/bin;%PATH%`. `set PYTHONPATH=%ROOTSYS%/bin;%PYTHONPATH%`. where `$ROOTSYS` should be set to; `/afs/cern.ch/sw/root/<version>/<platform>`, and `PYTHONDIR` to; `/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/Python/2.3.4/<platform>` with `<version>`; and `<platform>` as appropriate. Note that the latest version of Python; is 2.4.1. #### Building from Source. The standard installation instructions for building ROOT from source; apply, with the addition that the build of `PyROOT` needs to be enabled; at the configuration step. First, follow the instructions for obtaining; and unpacking the source, and setting up the build environment.

Deployability,"Q`` loaded from ``P``. Dependency applies only to values derived directly or indirectly from; a particular expression result and does not occur merely because a; separate pointer value dynamically aliases ``P``. Furthermore, this; dependency is not carried by values that are stored to objects. .. admonition:: Rationale. The restrictions on dependency are intended to make this analysis; feasible by an optimizer with only incomplete information about a; program. Essentially, dependence is carried to ""obvious"" uses of a; pointer. Merely passing a pointer argument to a function does not; itself cause dependence, but since generally the optimizer will not; be able to prove that the function doesn't depend on that parameter,; it will be forced to conservatively assume it does. Dependency propagates to values loaded from a pointer because those; values might be invalidated by deallocating the object. For; example, given the code ``__strong id x = p->ivar;``, ARC must not; move the release of ``p`` to between the load of ``p->ivar`` and the; retain of that value for storing into ``x``. Dependency does not propagate through stores of dependent pointer; values because doing so would allow dependency to outlive the; full-expression which produced the original value. For example, the; address of an instance variable could be written to some global; location and then freely accessed during the lifetime of the local,; or a function could return an inner pointer of an object and store; it to a local. These cases would be potentially impossible to; reason about and so would basically prevent any optimizations based; on imprecise lifetime. There are also uncommon enough to make it; reasonable to require the precise-lifetime annotation if someone; really wants to rely on them. Dependency does propagate through return values of pointer type.; The compelling source of need for this rule is a property accessor; which returns an un-autoreleased result; the calling function must; have the",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst:81111,release,release,81111,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.rst,1,['release'],['release']

This allows users to defer the choice of whether; to use LTO or not to link-time, and has been a feature available in other; compilers, like `GCC; <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/LTO-Overview.html>`_, for some time. Under FatLTO the compiler can emit standard object files which contain both the; machine code in the ``.text`` section and LLVM bitcode in the ``.llvm.lto``; section. Overview; ========. Within LLVM, FatLTO is supported by choosing the ``FatLTODefaultPipeline``.; This pipeline will:. #) Run the pre-link (Thin)LTO pipeline on the current module.; #) Embed the pre-link bitcode in a special ``.llvm.lto`` section.; #) Finish optimizing the module using the ModuleOptimization pipeline.; #) Emit the object file, including the new ``.llvm.lto`` section. .. NOTE. Previously, we conservatively ran independent pipelines on separate copies; of the LLVM module to generate the bitcode section and the object code,; which happen to be identical to those used outside of FatLTO. While that; resulted in compiled artifacts that were identical to those produced by the; default and (Thin)LTO pipelines, module cloning led to some cases of; miscompilation, and we have moved away from trying to keep bitcode; generation and optimization completely disjoint. Bit-for-bit compatibility is not (and never was) a guarantee, and we reserve; the right to change this at any time. Explicitly, users should not rely on; the produced bitcode or object code to match their non-LTO counterparts; precisely. They will exhibit similar performance characteristics, but may; not be bit-for-bit the same. Internally, the ``.llvm.lto`` section is created by running the; ``EmbedBitcodePass`` after the ``ThinLTOPreLinkDefaultPipeline``. This pass is; responsible for emitting the ``.llvm.lto`` section. Afterwards, the; ``ThinLTODefaultPipeline`` runs and the compiler can emit the fat object ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FatLTO.rst:1212,pipeline,pipelines,1212,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FatLTO.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/FatLTO.rst,1,['pipeline'],['pipelines']

In the case of AMD; Jaguar, there are two register files, one for floating-point registers (JFpuPRF); and one for integer registers (JIntegerPRF). The table shows that of the 900; instructions processed, there were 900 mappings created. Since this dot-product; example utilized only floating point registers, the JFPuPRF was responsible for; creating the 900 mappings. However, we see that the pipeline only used a; maximum of 35 of 72 available register slots at any given time. We can conclude; that the floating point PRF was the only register file used for the example, and; that it was never resource constrained. The register file statistics are; displayed by using the command option ``-all-stats`` or; ``-register-file-stats``. In this example, we can conclude that the IPC is mostly limited by data; dependencies, and not by resource pressure. Instruction Flow; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; This section describes the instruction flow through the default pipeline of; :program:`llvm-mca`, as well as the functional units involved in the process. The default pipeline implements the following sequence of stages used to; process instructions. * Dispatch (Instruction is dispatched to the schedulers).; * Issue (Instruction is issued to the processor pipelines).; * Write Back (Instruction is executed, and results are written back).; * Retire (Instruction is retired; writes are architecturally committed). The in-order pipeline implements the following sequence of stages:; * InOrderIssue (Instruction is issued to the processor pipelines).; * Retire (Instruction is retired; writes are architecturally committed). :program:`llvm-mca` assumes that instructions have all been decoded and placed; into a queue before the simulation start. Therefore, the instruction fetch and; decode stages are not modeled. Performance bottlenecks in the frontend are not; diagnosed. Also, :program:`llvm-mca` does not model branch prediction.

The default compression algorithm used when writing ROOT files has been updated to use LZ4 in particular to improve read (decompression) performance. You can change this default for each file through (for example) the `TFile constructor` or `TFile::SetCompressionAlgorithm`. It should be noted that ROOT files written with LZ4 compression can not be read with older release of ROOT. Support for LZ4 was however back-ported to the patch branches of previous releases and the following tags (and later release in the same patch series) can read ROOT files written with LZ4 compression:. * v5.34/38; * v6.08/06 [not yet released]; * v6.10/08; * v6.12/02. ## Removed interfaces. ## Core Libraries; - Optimize away redundant deserialization of template specializations. This reduces the memory footprint for hsimple by around 30% while improving the runtime performance for various cases by around 15%.; - When ROOT is signaled with a SIGUSR2 (i.e. on Linux and MacOS X) it will now print a backtrace.; - Move RStringView.h to ROOT/RStringView.hxx and always include ROOT/RStringView.hxx instead of RStringView.h for backward compatibility; - In `TClingCallFunc`, support r-value reference parameters. This paves the way for the corresponding support in PyROOT (implemented now in the latest Cppyy).; - Included the new TSequentialExecutor in ROOT, sharing the interfaces of TExecutor.This should improve code economy when providing a fallback for TThreadExecutor/TProcessExecutor. ### Thread safety; - Resolved several race conditions, dead-locks, performance and order of initialization/destruction issues still lingering",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v614/index.md:1662,release,released,1662,README/ReleaseNotes/v614/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v614/index.md,1,['release'],['released']

Deployability,"Sel is a framework that provides a set of reusable passes and utilities; for instruction selection --- translation from LLVM IR to target-specific; Machine IR (MIR). GlobalISel is intended to be a replacement for SelectionDAG and FastISel, to; solve three major problems:. * **Performance** --- SelectionDAG introduces a dedicated intermediate; representation, which has a compile-time cost. GlobalISel directly operates on the post-isel representation used by the; rest of the code generator, MIR.; It does require extensions to that representation to support arbitrary; incoming IR: :ref:`gmir`. * **Granularity** --- SelectionDAG and FastISel operate on individual basic; blocks, losing some global optimization opportunities. GlobalISel operates on the whole function. * **Modularity** --- SelectionDAG and FastISel are radically different and share; very little code. GlobalISel is built in a way that enables code reuse. For instance, both the; optimized and fast selectors share the :ref:`pipeline`, and targets can; configure that pipeline to better suit their needs. Design and Implementation Reference; ===================================. More information on the design and implementation of GlobalISel can be found in; the following sections. .. toctree::; :maxdepth: 1. GMIR; GenericOpcode; MIRPatterns; Pipeline; Porting; Resources.

Progress and Future Work; ========================. The initial goal is to replace FastISel on AArch64. The next step will be to; replace SelectionDAG as the optimized ISel. ``NOTE``:; While we iterate on GlobalISel, we strive to avoid affecting the performance of; SelectionDAG, FastISel, or the other MIR passes.

Many, many bugs have been fixed; thanks to everyone who has reported them!. #### Cling. Cling is now using a new just-in-time compilation engine called OrcJIT, a development based on MCJIT. It enables interpretation of inline assembly and exceptions; it will hopefully in the near future also support interpreting thread local storage (but doesn't at the moment). Thanks to the new JIT, cling also comes with debug symbols for interpreted code; you can enable them with "".debug"". #### Function evaluation. Function calls through TMethodCall etc have been accelerated. #### llvm / clang. llvm / clang were updated to r227800. This includes everything from the clang 3.6 release. ### Dictionary Generation. Detect usage of #pragma once for inlined headers. Turn on verbosity of genreflex if the VERBOSE environment variable is defined. Optimise forward declarations in rootmap files in order to make their interpretation faster. Propagate attributes specified in xml selection files to selected classes even when selected through typedefs.

Check out the LLVM project:; ; Change directory to where you want the llvm directory placed.; git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git; The above command is very slow. It can be made faster by creating a shallow clone. Shallow clone saves storage and speeds up the checkout time. This is done by using the command:; ; git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git (using this only the latest version of llvm can be built); For normal users looking to just compile, this command works fine. But if someone later becomes a contributor, since they can't push code from a shallow clone, it needs to be converted into a full clone:; ; cd llvm-project; git fetch --unshallow. Build LLVM and Clang:; ; cd llvm-project; mkdir build (in-tree build is not supported); cd build; This builds both LLVM and Clang in release mode.

Code Reviews, Speed, and Reciprocity; ------------------------------------. Sometimes code reviews will take longer than you might hope, especially for; larger features. Common ways to speed up review times for your patches are:. * Review other people's patches.

If it is urgent, provide reasons why it is important to you to; get this patch landed and ping it every couple of days. If it is; not urgent, the common courtesy ping rate is one week.

Developers on IRC will be able to either help you; directly, or tell you who might be a good reviewer.; * Split your patch into multiple smaller patches that build on each other. The; smaller your patch is, the higher the probability that somebody will take a quick; look at it. When doing this, it is helpful to add ""[N/M]"" (for 1 <= N <= M) to; the title of each patch in the series, so it is clear that there is an order; and what that order is.

MathCore Numerical Algorithms. Classes implementing numerical methods which can be used by all the other ROOT library have been added in MathCore. These originate mainly from methods present previously in the implementation of the TF1 class. Now they can be used also outside this class. In addition, in order to have a common entry point, interfaces classes for these numerical algorithms have been; included.; These interfaces are as well implemented by classes using the GSL library and located in the MathMore library. The library can be loaded automatically using the ROOT plug-in manager.; In detail, the new classes containing implementations present previously in TF1 are:. ; GaussIntegrator and GaussLegendreIntegrator for numerical integration of one-dimensional functions. The first class uses Gaussian 8 and 16 point quadrature approximation, it provides the translation of the CERNLIB algorithm; DGAUSS by Sigfried Kolbig, and it is used by the TF1::Integral method. The second one uses the Gauss Legendre quadrature formula. It is used by the TF1::IntegralFast method.; These classes implement both the same virtual interface as the adaptive integration methods provided by the MathMore library. They can all be created and used easily via the common class ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim providing the interfaces for numerical integration.; New template methods have been also included in the common Integration class in order to be able to integrate automatically any C++ callable object.

Because the; intrinsics have experimental status, compatibility across LLVM; releases is not guaranteed. The stack map functionality described in this document is separate; from the functionality described in; :ref:`stack-map`. `GCFunctionMetadata` provides the location of; pointers into a collected heap captured by the `GCRoot` intrinsic,; which can also be considered a ""stack map"". Unlike the stack maps; defined above, the `GCFunctionMetadata` stack map interface does not; provide a way to associate live register values of arbitrary type with; an instruction address, nor does it specify a format for the resulting; stack map. The stack maps described here could potentially provide; richer information to a garbage collecting runtime, but that usage; will not be discussed in this document. Intrinsics; ==========. The following two kinds of intrinsics can be used to implement stack; maps and patch points: ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` and; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``. Both kinds of intrinsics generate a; stack map record, and they both allow some form of code patching. They; can be used independently (i.e. ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``; implicitly generates a stack map without the need for an additional; call to ``llvm.experimental.stackmap``). The choice of which to use; depends on whether it is necessary to reserve space for code patching; and whether any of the intrinsic arguments should be lowered according; to calling conventions. ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` does not; reserve any space, nor does it expect any call arguments. If the; runtime patches code at the stack map's address, it will destructively; overwrite the program text. This is unlike; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``, which reserves space for in-place; patching without overwriting surrounding code. The; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint`` intrinsic also lowers a specif",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst:3053,patch,patch,3053,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,1,['patch'],['patch']

If so, it loads that test suite recursively,; otherwise it instantiates a local test config for the directory (see; :ref:`local-configuration-files`). Tests are identified by the test suite they are contained within, and the; relative path inside that suite.

He needs to create the; `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim` class for integrating one-dimensional functions and `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDim` for multi-dimensional functions.; Through the ROOT Plug-In Manager, the user can initialize `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim` or `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDim` with; any of the concrete integration classes without dealing with them directly.; These two classes provide the same interface as in `VirtualIntegratorOneDim` and `VirtualIntegratorMultiDim`, but with the possibility to choose in the constructor,; which method will be used to perform the integration. The method to set the function to be integrated, must be of the function interface type described before.; `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionOneDimFunction` is used for `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim` and; The only difference between the `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim` and `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDim` resides; in the dimensionality of that function and some specific that will be seen afterwards for the one dimensional one. ![ROOT::Math Numerical Integrator classes](pictures/Integr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md:49028,integrat,integrating,49028,documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/MathLibraries.md,1,['integrat'],['integrating']

Deployability,"The Dataset Stager; ==================. Overview; --------. The [Dataset Stager (afdsmgrd)](http://afdsmgrd.googlecode.com/) is; a daemon that coordinates the transfer of data from a remote storage; to your local storage. For each file to transfer, a script is called. The script can be; customized to support your source and destination protocol. Staging requests are issued from the ROOT console, where you can also; control the progress of your staging. Installation; ------------. The Dataset Stager is distributed both on a repository on its own and as; part of ROOT. The easiest way to compile it is to do it inside ROOT. Installing from ROOT; --------------------. When configuring the ROOT source, enable the Dataset Stager by adding; `--enable-afdsmgrd`. Check in the list of enabled features if you have; ""afdsmgrd"". After running `make` (and, optionally, `make install`) you'll find the; daemon in the same directory of `root.exe`. The configuration file and init.d startup script will be in; `$ROOTSYS/etc/proof`. The daemon can and **must** run as unprivileged; user. Configuration; -------------. The Dataset Stager can share its configuration file with PROOF, as; some directives are the same and unknown directives are just ignored. Directives are one per line and lines beginning with a pound sign (`#`); are used for comments. > The configuration file is automatically checked at each loop: this; > means you can change configuration without restarting the daemon or; > stopping your current transfers. A detailed description of each directive follows. set *VARIABLE=value*; : This statement will substitute every occurrence of `$VARIABLE` with; its *value* in the rest of the configuration file. You can have; multiple `set` statements. xpd.stagereqrepo [dir:]*directory*; : This directive is shared with PROOF: *directory* is the full path to; the dataset repository. **Defaults to empty:** without this; directive the daemon is not operative.

By default, PROOF is not configured and built any more. It will be deprecated in the future given that its functionality is now provided by the superior RDataFrame and its distributed version, [DistRDF](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html#distrdf). ## PyROOT. PyROOT was rebased on the latest version of the [cppyy library](https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).; This means PyROOT benefits from many upstream improvements and fixes, for example related to the conversion of NumPy arrays to vectors, implicit conversion from nested Python tuples to nested initializer lists, and improved overload resolution. Related to this cppyy upgrade, there are some changes in PyROOT behavior. ### Different representation of `std::string`. Calling `repr()` on a `cppyy.gbl.std.string` object now comes with a ""b"" prefix, i.e. a bytes object is returned instead of a Python string.; This is an intentional change for better unicode support. See: https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15153#issuecomment-2040504962. ### No more implicit conversion of static size `char` buffer to Python strings. A static size character buffer of type `char[n]` is not converted to a Python string anymore.; The reason for this: since it was previously assumed the string was; null-terminated, there was no way to get the bytes after a `null`, even if you; wanted to. ```python; import ROOT. ROOT.gInterpreter.Declare(""""""; struct Struct { char char_buffer[5] {}; }; // struct with char[n]; void fill_char_buffer(Struct & st) {; std::string foo{""foo""};; std::memcpy(st.char_buffer, foo.data(), foo.size());; }; """"""). struct = ROOT.Struct(); ROOT.fill_char_buffer(struct",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md:19613,upgrade,upgrade,19613,README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v632/index.md,1,['upgrade'],['upgrade']

Deployability,"Thu Jun 26 14:43:04 CDT 2003. Information about BinInterface; ------------------------------. Take in a set of instructions with some particular register; allocation. It allows you to add, modify, or delete some instructions,; in SSA form (kind of like LLVM's MachineInstrs.) Then re-allocate; registers. It assumes that the transformations you are doing are safe.; It does not update the mapping information or the LLVM representation; for the modified trace (so it would not, for instance, support; multiple optimization passes; passes have to be aware of and update; manually the mapping information.). The way you use it is you take the original code and provide it to; BinInterface; then you do optimizations to it, then you put it in the; trace cache. The BinInterface tries to find live-outs for traces so that it can do; register allocation on just the trace, and stitch the trace back into; the original code. It has to preserve the live-ins and live-outs when; it does its register allocation. (On exits from the trace we have; epilogues that copy live-outs back into the right registers, but; live-ins have to be in the right registers.). Limitations of BinInterface; ---------------------------. It does copy insertions for PHIs, which it infers from the machine; code. The mapping info inserted by LLC is not sufficient to determine; the PHIs. It does not handle integer or floating-point condition codes and it; does not handle floating-point register allocation. It is not aggressively able to use lots of registers. There is a problem with alloca: we cannot find our spill space for; spilling registers, normally allocated on the stack, if the trace; follows an alloca(). What might be an acceptable solution would be to; disable trace generation on functions that have variable-sized; alloca()s. Variable-sized allocas in the trace would also probably; screw things up. Because of the FP and alloca limitations, the BinInterface is; completely disabled right now. Demo; ----.

Deployability,"UN lines are interpreted by :program:`lit`.; Consequently, the syntax differs from shell in a few ways. You can specify; as many RUN lines as needed. :program:`lit` performs substitution on each RUN line to replace LLVM tool names; with the full paths to the executable built for each tool (in; ``$(LLVM_OBJ_ROOT)/bin``). This ensures that :program:`lit` does; not invoke any stray LLVM tools in the user's path during testing. Each RUN line is executed on its own, distinct from other lines unless; its last character is ``\``. This continuation character causes the RUN; line to be concatenated with the next one. In this way you can build up; long pipelines of commands without making huge line lengths. The lines; ending in ``\`` are concatenated until a RUN line that doesn't end in; ``\`` is found. This concatenated set of RUN lines then constitutes one; execution. :program:`lit` will substitute variables and arrange for the pipeline; to be executed. If any process in the pipeline fails, the entire line (and; test case) fails too. Below is an example of legal RUN lines in a ``.ll`` file:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llvm-as < %s | llvm-dis > %t1; ; RUN: llvm-dis < %s.bc-13 > %t2; ; RUN: diff %t1 %t2. As with a Unix shell, the RUN lines permit pipelines and I/O; redirection to be used. There are some quoting rules that you must pay attention to when writing; your RUN lines. In general nothing needs to be quoted. :program:`lit` won't; strip off any quote characters so they will get passed to the invoked program.; To avoid this use curly braces to tell :program:`lit` that it should treat; everything enclosed as one value. In general, you should strive to keep your RUN lines as simple as possible,; using them only to run tools that generate textual output you can then examine.; The recommended way to examine output to figure out if the test passes is using; the :doc:`FileCheck tool <CommandGuide/FileCheck>`. *[The usage of grep in RUN; lines is deprecated - please do not se",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst:9886,pipeline,pipeline,9886,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/TestingGuide.rst,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

Finding Clang runtime libraries; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. clang-cl supports several features that require runtime library support:. - Address Sanitizer (ASan): ``-fsanitize=address``; - Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (UBSan): ``-fsanitize=undefined``; - Code coverage: ``-fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping``; - Profile Guided Optimization (PGO): ``-fprofile-generate``; - Certain math operations (int128 division) require the builtins library. In order to use these features, the user must link the right runtime libraries; into their program. These libraries are distributed alongside Clang in the; library resource directory. Clang searches for the resource directory by; searching relative to the Clang executable. For example, if LLVM is installed; in ``C:\Program Files\LLVM``, then the profile runtime library will be located; at the path; ``C:\Program Files\LLVM\lib\clang\11.0.0\lib\windows\clang_rt.profile-x86_64.lib``. For UBSan, PGO, and coverage, Clang will emit object files that auto-link the; appropriate runtime library, but the user generally needs to help the linker; (whether it is ``lld-link.exe`` or MSVC ``link.exe``) find the library resource; directory. Using the example installation above, this would mean passing; ``/LIBPATH:C:\Program Files\LLVM\lib\clang\11.0.0\lib\windows`` to the linker.; If the user links the program with the ``clang`` or ``clang-cl`` drivers, the; driver will pass this flag for them. If the linker cannot find the appropriate library, it will emit an error like; this::. $ clang-cl -c -fsanitize=undefined t.cpp. $ lld-link t.obj -dll; lld-link: error: could not open 'clang_rt.ubsan_standalone-x86_64.lib': no such file or directory; lld-link: error: could not open 'clang_rt.ubsan_standalone_cxx-x86_64.lib': no such file or directory. $ link t",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:190993,install,installed,190993,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['install'],['installed']

If the former, clone the repository, check out a specific tagged release as; needed, then run the following steps to add Cling and build a wheel.; Once built, install the wheel as appropriate::. $ git clone https://github.com/wlav/cppyy-backend.git; $ cd cppyy-backend/cling; $ python setup.py egg_info; $ python create_src_directory.py; $ python setup.py bdist_wheel; $ python -m pip install dist/cppyy_cling-* --upgrade. .. note::; ``cppyy-cling`` wheels do not depend on the Python interpreter and can; thus be re-used for any version of Python or PyPy.

Deployability,"When and why was Cling developed?; ---------------------------------. Cling was first released in 2014 as the interactive, C++ interpreter in; ROOT. `ROOT <https://root.cern/>`_ is an open-source program written primarily; in C++, developed by research groups in high-energy physics including `CERN; <https://home.cern/>`_, `FERMILAB <https://www.fnal.gov/>`_ and `Princeton; <https://www.princeton.edu/>`_. ROOT is nowadays used by most high-energy; physics experiments. CERN is an European research organization that operates the; largest particle physics laboratory in the world. Its experiments collect; petabytes of data per year to be serialized, analyzed, and visualized as C++; objects. In this framework, Cling was developed with the aim to facilitate the; processing of scientific data in the field of high-energy physics . Cling is a; core component of ROOT: it provides essential functionality for the analysis of; vast amounts of very complex data produced by the experimental high-energy; physics community by enabling (1) interactive exploration in C++, (2) dynamic; interoperability (see `cppyy <https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, an; automatic, runtime Python/C++ binder), and (3) rapid prototyping capabilities.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/cling/docs/chapters/background.rst:86,release,released,86,interpreter/cling/docs/chapters/background.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/cling/docs/chapters/background.rst,1,['release'],['released']
Deployability,"Why interpreting C++ with Cling?; -----------------------------------. 1. **Learning C++:**; ; One use case of Cling is to aid the C++ learning process. Offering imediate; feedback the user can easily get familiar with the structures and spelling of; the language. 2. **Creating scripts:**; ; The power of an interpreter lays as well in the compactness and ease of; repeatedly running a small snippet of code - aka a script. This can be done in; Cling by inserting the bash-like style line:. .. code:: bash; ; #!/usr/bin/cling; ; 3. **Rapid Application Development (RAD):**. Cling can be used successfully for Rapid Application Development allowing for; prototyping and proofs of concept taking advantage of dynamicity and feedback; during the implementation process. 4. **Runtime-Generated Code**. Sometime it's convenient to create code as a reaction to input; (user/network/configuration). Runtime-generated code can interface with C++; libraries. 5. **Embedding Cling:**. The functionality of an application can be enriched by embedding Cling. To embed; Cling, the main program has to be provided. One of the things this main program; has to do is initialize the Cling interpreter. There are optional calls to pass; command line arguments to Cling. Afterwards, you can call the interpreter from; any anywhere within the application. For compilation and linkage the application needs the path to the Clang and LLVM; libraries and the invocation is order dependent since the linker cannot do; backward searches. .. code:: bash. g++ embedcling.cxx -std=c++11 -L/usr/local/lib; -lclingInterpreter -lclingUtils ; -lclangFrontend -lclangSerialization -lclangParse -lclangSema ; -lclangAnalysis -lclangEdit -lclangLex -lclangDriver -lclangCodeGen ; -lclangBasic -lclangAST ; `llvm-config ; --libs bitwriter mcjit orcjit native option ; ipo profiledata instrumentation objcarcopts` ; -lz -pthread -ldl -ltinfo ; -o embedcling; .

Deployability,"With the exception of retains done as part of initializing a ``__strong``; parameter variable or reading a ``__weak`` variable, whenever these semantics; call for retaining a value of block-pointer type, it has the effect of a; ``Block_copy``. The optimizer may remove such copies when it sees that the; result is used only as an argument to a call. When a block pointer type is converted to a non-block pointer type (such as; ``id``), ``Block_copy`` is called.

For more difficult problems the full FOAM may be better. ### How to run application programs ?. The application program can be run in two modes: it can be simply; interpreted by CLING or compiled. The first method is simpler but; results in slower execution. The second method employs ACLiC -; The Automatic Compiler of Libraries, which automatizes the; process of compilation and linking.

The `$ROOTSYS/gdml` directory contains a set of Python modules designed; for writing out Geometry Description Markup Language (GDML) files.; There is also a C++ implementation for the import of GDML into ROOT.; They act as a converter between the GDML geometry files and the TGeo; geometry structures (and vice versa). ### GDML->ROOT. As this binding is integrated into the ROOT installation, you need to; enable the use of the binding at the configure point of the ROOT; installation. This can be done like so:. ~~~ {.cpp}; ./configure --enable-gdml; ~~~. On doing this the libraries will be built by issuing the standard ROOT; make command. The GDML to TGeo converter uses the TXMLEngine to parse; the GDML files. This XML parser is a DOM parser and returns the DOM; tree to the class TGDMLParse. This class then interprets the GDML file; and adds the bindings in their TGeo equivalent. The GDML schema is fully supported with a few exceptions:. - Replica Volumes are not supported; - Loops are not supported; - Matrices are not supported. These will hopefully be added in the near future. Once you have enabled GDML in the configure process for ROOT, to import; a GDML file, this can be done using TGeoManager::Import. This automatically; calls the right method to parse the GDML by detecting the .gdml file; extension. Here is how to do it:. ~~~ {.cpp}; TGeoManager::Import(""test.gdml"");; ~~~. Replace test.gdml with the gdml filename you want to import. Once the; GDML file has been successfully imported, you can view the geometry by; calling:. ~~~ {.cpp}; gGeoManager->GetTopVolume()->Draw(""ogl"");; ~~~.

We have then the following cases depending on the dimension and the distribution object. - For 1D distribution the class **TUnuranContDist** must be used.; - A **TUnuranContDist** object can be created from a function; providing the pdf (probability density function) and optionally one providing the derivative of the pdf.; - If the derivative is not provided and the generation method requires it, then it is estimated numerically.; - The user can optionally provide the; - cdf (cumulative distribution function) via the **TUnuranContDist::SetCdf** function,; - the mode via **TUnuranContDist::SetMode**,; - the domain via **TUnuranContDist::",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/unuran/doc/index.md:422,continuous,continuous,422,math/unuran/doc/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/unuran/doc/index.md,1,['continuous'],['continuous']

Tests are being conducted continuously to ensure correctness of the results, but the interfaces and the instructions on how to use might change. ### Purpose; While fitting, a significant amount of time and processing power is spent on computing the probability function for every event and PDF involved in the fitting model. To speed up this process, roofit can use the computation functions provided in this library. The functions provided here process whole data arrays (batches) instead of a single event at a time, as in the legacy evaluate() function in roofit. In addition, the code is written in a manner that allows for compiler optimizations, notably auto-vectorization. This library is compiled multiple times for different [vector instruction set architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) and the optimal code is executed during runtime, as a result of an automatic hardware detection mechanism that this library contains. **As a result, fits can benefit by a speedup of 3x-16x.**. As of ROOT v6.26, RooBatchComputes also provides multithread and [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) instances of the computation functions, resulting in even greater improvements for fitting times. ### How to use; This library is an internal component of RooFit, so users are not supposed to actively interact with it. Instead, they can benefit from significantly faster times for fitting by calling `fitTo()` and providing a `BatchMode(""cpu"")` or a `BatchMode(""cuda"")` option.; ``` {.cpp}; // fit using the most efficient library that the computer's CPU can support; RooMyPDF.fitTo(data, BatchMode(""cpu""));. //",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/batchcompute.md:406,continuous,continuously,406,roofit/doc/developers/batchcompute.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/batchcompute.md,1,['continuous'],['continuously']

The interface is restricted to; minimization and no parameter interaction is possible. ### Using an application (MnMigrad) ###. MnMigrad uses the VariableMetricMinimizer for minimization but allows as; well for parameter interaction by the user. An instance of MnMigrad is; specific to the current $\mbox{FCN}$ and user parameters. Any; parameter interaction of the user between two minimization steps will; make use of the result of the preceeding minimization in an optimal way.; The interface for parameters (see [api:parameters], [api:covariance] and; [api:state]) is forwardedin MnMigrad. ### Subsequent minimizations ###. M takes care that all information is treated in an optimal and correct; way if the user interacts with the parameters between two minimizations.; MnMigrad retains the result of the last minimization and uses this as; input for the next step. Between two minimization requests to MnMigrad; the user can fix or release parameters, put limits on them or remove; limits from them. Each instance of a MnMigrad object maintains its own; state and one can have multiple instances of MnMigrad objects. ### M fails to find a minimum ###. If M fails to find a minimum, the user is notified by a warning message; issued by M when running into troubles. Problems can be:. - a bug in M. - an error in the $\mbox{FCN}$. - a highly difficult problem (usually strong correlations among; parameters). - floating–point precision. ## The output from minimization ##. ### The FunctionMinimum ###. The output of the minimizers is the FunctionMinimum. The FunctionMinimum; contains the result of the minimization in both internal parameter; representation and external parameter representation. ### User representable format: MnUserParameterState ###. On request, the result of the minimization is transformed into a user; representable format for parameters and errors, the; MnUserParameterState. ### Access values, errors, covari",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:35088,release,release,35088,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['release'],['release']

The file header is always; at the beginning of the file, while the data records and free segments; may in principle appear in any order. The file header is fixed length (64 bytes in the current; release.) It's detailed format is given in \ref header. A free segment is of variable length. One free segment is a set; of contiguous bytes that are unused, and are available for ROOTIO to use; for new or resized data records. The first four bytes of a a free; segment contain the negative of the number of bytes in the segment. The; contents of the remainder of the free segment are irrelevant. A data record represents either user data or data used; internally by ROOTIO. All data records have two portions, a ""key""; portion and a ""data"" portion. The key portion precedes the data; portion. The format of the key portion is the same for all data.; (The key portion corresponds to a class TKey object). The object name; and they key cycle are together sufficient to uniquely determine the; record within the file.

Deployability,"](pictures/020000A6.jpg). If `pad1` is a pad then, it will divide the pad into 3 columns of 2; sub-pads. The generated sub-pads get names `pad1_i` where the index; `i=1` to `nxm` (in our case `pad1_1`, `pad1_2`...`pad1_6)`. The names; `pad1_1 `etc... correspond to new variables in Cling, so you may use them; as soon as the executed method was `pad->Divide()`. However, in a; compiled program, one has to access these objects. Remember that a pad; contains other objects and that these objects may themselves be pads. So; we can use the `GetPrimitive()` method:. ``` {.cpp}; TPad* pad1_1 = (TPad*)(pad1->GetPrimitive(""pad1_1"")); ```. One question remains. In case one does an automatic divide, how one can; set the default margins between pads? This is done by adding two; parameters to `Divide()`, which are the margins in `x` and `y`:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] pad1->Divide(3,2,0.1,0.1); ```. The margins are here set to 10% of the parent pad width. ### Updating the Pad. For performance reasons, a pad is not updated with every change. For; example, changing the coordinates of the pad does not automatically; redraw it. Instead, the pad has a ""bit-modified"" that triggers a redraw.; This bit is automatically set by:. - Touching the pad with the mouse - for example resizing it with the; mouse. - Finishing the execution of a script. - Adding a new primitive or modifying some primitives for example the; name and title of an object. - You can also set the ""bit-modified"" explicitly with the `Modified`; method:. ``` {.cpp}; // the pad has changed; root[] pad1->Modified(); // recursively update all modified pads:; root[] c1->Update(); ```. A subsequent call to `TCanvas::Update()` scans the list of sub-pads; and repaints the pads declared modified. In compiled code or in a long macro, you may want to access an object; created during the paint process. To do so, you can force the painting; with a `TCanvas::Update()`. For example, a **`TGraph`** creates a; histogram (**`TH1`**) to paint itself.

Deployability,"^^. ``llvm.access.group`` metadata can be attached to any instruction that; potentially accesses memory. It can point to a single distinct metadata; node, which we call access group. This node represents all memory access; instructions referring to it via ``llvm.access.group``. When an; instruction belongs to multiple access groups, it can also point to a; list of accesses groups, illustrated by the following example. .. code-block:: llvm. %val = load i32, ptr %arrayidx, !llvm.access.group !0; ...; !0 = !{!1, !2}; !1 = distinct !{}; !2 = distinct !{}. It is illegal for the list node to be empty since it might be confused; with an access group. The access group metadata node must be 'distinct' to avoid collapsing; multiple access groups by content. An access group metadata node must; always be empty which can be used to distinguish an access group; metadata node from a list of access groups. Being empty avoids the; situation that the content must be updated which, because metadata is; immutable by design, would required finding and updating all references; to the access group node. The access group can be used to refer to a memory access instruction; without pointing to it directly (which is not possible in global; metadata).

A fence A which has (at least) ``release`` ordering semantics; *synchronizes with* a fence B with (at least) ``acquire`` ordering; semantics if and only if there exist atomic operations X and Y, both; operating on some atomic object M, such that A is sequenced before X, X; modifies M (either directly or through some side effect of a sequence; headed by X), Y is sequenced before B, and Y observes M. This provides a; *happens-before* dependency between A and B. Rather than an explicit; ``fence``, one (but not both) of the atomic operations X or Y might; provide a ``release`` or ``acquire`` (resp.) ordering constraint and; still *synchronize-with* the explicit ``fence`` and establish the; *happens-before* edge. A ``fence`` which has ``seq_cst`` ordering, in addition to having both; ``acquire`` and ``release`` semantics specified above, participates in; the global program order of other ``seq_cst`` operations and/or; fences. Furthermore, the global ordering created by a ``seq_cst``; fence must be compatible with the individual total orders of; ``monotonic`` (or stronger) memory accesses occurring before and after; such a fence.

Deployability,"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Support for languages which allow unmanaged pointers to garbage collected; objects (i.e. pass a pointer to an object to a C routine) in the abstract; machine model. At the moment, the best idea on how to approach this; involves an intrinsic or opaque function which hides the connection between; the reference value and the raw pointer. The problem is that having a; ptrtoint or inttoptr cast (which is common for such use cases) breaks the; rules used for inferring base pointers for arbitrary references when; lowering out of the abstract model to the explicit physical model. Note; that a frontend which lowers directly to the physical model doesn't have; any problems here. Objects on the Stack; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. As noted above, the explicit lowering supports objects allocated on the; stack provided the collector can find a heap map given the stack address. The missing pieces are a) integration with rewriting (RS4GC) from the; abstract machine model and b) support for optionally decomposing on stack; objects so as not to require heap maps for them. The later is required; for ease of integration with some collectors. Lowering Quality and Representation Overhead; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The current statepoint lowering is known to be somewhat poor. In the very; long term, we'd like to integrate statepoints with the register allocator;; in the near term this is unlikely to happen. We've found the quality of; lowering to be relatively unimportant as hot-statepoints are almost always; inliner bugs. Concerns have been raised that the statepoint representation results in a; large amount of IR being produced for some examples and that this; contributes to higher than expected memory usage and compile times.

LLVM Project Wrappers; =====================. LLVM projects provide lots of wrappers around critical CMake built-in commands.; We use these wrappers to provide consistent behaviors across LLVM components; and to reduce code duplication. We generally (but not always) follow the convention that commands prefaced with; ``llvm_`` are intended to be used only as building blocks for other commands.; Wrapper commands that are intended for direct use are generally named following; with the project in the middle of the command name (i.e. ``add_llvm_executable``; is the wrapper for ``add_executable``). The LLVM ``add_*`` wrapper functions are; all defined in ``AddLLVM.cmake`` which is installed as part of the LLVM; distribution. It can be included and used by any LLVM sub-project that requires; LLVM. .. note::. Not all LLVM projects require LLVM for all use cases. For example compiler-rt; can be built without LLVM, and the compiler-rt sanitizer libraries are used; with GCC. Useful Built-in Commands; ========================. CMake has a bunch of useful built-in commands. This document isn't going to; go into details about them because The CMake project has excellent; documentation. To highlight a few useful functions see:. * `add_custom_command <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.4/command/add_custom_command.html>`_; * `add_custom_target <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.4/command/add_custom_target.html>`_; * `file <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.4/command/file.html>`_; * `list <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.4/command/list.html>`_; * `math <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.4/command/math.html>`_; * `string <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.4/command/string.html>`_.

The 2nd version is optimized to read the content of TClonesArrays and vectors of pointers to objects. The 3rd version is used to streamed any collections. TBufferXML and TBufferSQL overload the loops to introduce extra code to help the buffer keep track of which streamer element is being streamed (this functionality is not used by TBufferFile.). A TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence is an ordered sequence of configured actions. A configured action has both an action which is a free standing function and a configuration object deriving; from TStreamerInfoActions::TConfiguration. The configuration contains information that is specific to the action; but varies from use to use, including the offset from the beginning of the object that needs to be updated.; Other examples of configuration include the number of bits requested for storing a Double32_t or its factor and minimum.

For example you may want to work on clang; or lldb by specifying ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=""clang;lldb""``. **LLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES**:STRING; Control which runtimes are enabled. For example you may want to work on; libc++ or libc++abi by specifying ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES=""libcxx;libcxxabi""``. **LLVM_LIBDIR_SUFFIX**:STRING; Extra suffix to append to the directory where libraries are to be; installed. On a 64-bit architecture, one could use ``-DLLVM_LIBDIR_SUFFIX=64``; to install libraries to ``/usr/lib64``. **LLVM_PARALLEL_{COMPILE,LINK}_JOBS**:STRING; Building the llvm toolchain can use a lot of resources, particularly; linking. These options, when you use the Ninja generator, allow you; to restrict the parallelism. For example, to avoid OOMs or going; into swap, permit only one link job per 15GB of RAM available on a; 32GB machine, specify ``-G Ninja -DLLVM_PARALLEL_LINK_JOBS=2``. **LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD**:STRING; Control which targets are enabled. For example you may only need to enable; your native target with, for example, ``-DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86``. .. _llvm_use_linker:. **LLVM_USE_LINKER**:STRING; Override the system's default linker.

The; command-line interface of the frontend is considered to be an implementation; detail, intentionally has no external documentation, and is subject to change; without notice. Language frontends for other languages; --------------------------------------. Clang can be provided with inputs written in non-C-family languages. In such; cases, an external tool will be used to compile the input. The; currently-supported languages are:. * Ada (``-x ada``, ``.ad[bs]``); * Fortran (``-x f95``, ``.f``, ``.f9[05]``, ``.for``, ``.fpp``, case-insensitive); * Java (``-x java``). In each case, GCC will be invoked to compile the input. Assembler; ---------. Clang can either use LLVM's integrated assembler or an external system-specific; tool (for instance, the GNU Assembler on GNU OSes) to produce machine code from; assembly.; By default, Clang uses LLVM's integrated assembler on all targets where it is; supported. If you wish to use the system assembler instead, use the; ``-fno-integrated-as`` option. Linker; ------. Clang can be configured to use one of several different linkers:. * GNU ld; * GNU gold; * LLVM's `lld <https://lld.llvm.org>`_; * MSVC's link.exe. Link-time optimization is natively supported by lld, and supported via; a `linker plugin <https://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html>`_ when using gold. The default linker varies between targets, and can be overridden via the; ``-fuse-ld=<linker name>`` flag. Runtime libraries; =================. A number of different runtime libraries are required to provide different; layers of support for C family programs. Clang will implicitly link an; appropriate implementation of each runtime library, selected based on; target defaults or explicitly selected by the ``--rtlib=`` and ``--stdlib=``; flags. The set of implicitly-linked libraries depend on the language mode. As a; consequence, you should use ``clang++`` when linking C++ programs in order; to ensure the C++ runtimes are provided. .. no",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Toolchain.rst:4244,integrat,integrated-as,4244,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Toolchain.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Toolchain.rst,1,['integrat'],['integrated-as']

Deployability,"`, it'll be Cortex-A8 with; NEON, but still using soft-float, which is much better, but still not; great. Toolchain Options; -----------------. There are three main options to control access to your cross-compiler:; ``--sysroot``, ``-I``, and ``-L``. The two last ones are well known,; but they're particularly important for additional libraries; and headers that are specific to your target. There are two main ways to have a cross-compiler:. #. When you have extracted your cross-compiler from a zip file into; a directory, you have to use ``--sysroot=<path>``. The path is the; root directory where you have unpacked your file, and Clang will; look for the directories ``bin``, ``lib``, ``include`` in there. In this case, your setup should be pretty much done (if no; additional headers or libraries are needed), as Clang will find; all binaries it needs (assembler, linker, etc) in there. #. When you have installed via a package manager (modern Linux; distributions have cross-compiler packages available), make; sure the target triple you set is *also* the prefix of your; cross-compiler toolchain. In this case, Clang will find the other binaries (assembler,; linker), but not always where the target headers and libraries; are. People add system-specific clues to Clang often, but as; things change, it's more likely that it won't find than the; other way around. So, here, you'll be a lot safer if you specify the include/library; directories manually (via ``-I`` and ``-L``). Target-Specific Libraries; =========================. All libraries that you compile as part of your build will be; cross-compiled to your target, and your build system will probably; find them in the right place. But all dependencies that are; normally checked against (like ``libxml`` or ``libz`` etc) will match; against the host platform, not the target. So, if the build system is not aware that you want to cross-compile; your code, it will get every dependency wrong, and your compilation; will fail during ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/CrossCompilation.rst:6960,install,installed,6960,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/CrossCompilation.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/CrossCompilation.rst,1,['install'],['installed']

Install from source; -------------------; .. _installation_from_source:. To build an existing release from source, tell ``pip`` to not download any; binary wheels.; Build-time only dependencies are ``cmake`` (for general build), ``python``; (obviously, but also for LLVM), and a modern C++ compiler (one that supports; at least C++14).; Use the envar ``STDCXX`` to control the C++ standard version; ``MAKE`` to; change the ``make`` command, ``MAKE_NPROCS`` to control the maximum number of; parallel jobs allowed, and ``VERBOSE=1`` to see full build/compile commands.; Example (using ``--verbose`` to see ``pip`` progress)::. $ STDCXX=17 MAKE_NPROCS=32 pip install --verbose cppyy --no-binary=cppyy-cling. Compilation of the backend, which contains a customized version of; Clang/LLVM, can take a long time, so by default the setup script will use all; cores (x2 if hyperthreading is enabled).; Once built, however, the wheel of ``cppyy-cling`` is reused by pip for all; versions of CPython and for PyPy, thus the long compilation is needed only; once for all different versions of Python on the same machine. See the :ref:`section on repos <building_from_source>` for more; details/options. PyPy; ----. PyPy 5.7 and 5.8 have a built-in module ``cppyy``.; You can still install the cppyy package, but the built-in module takes; precedence.; To use cppyy, first import a compatibility module::. $ pypy; [PyPy 5.8.0 with GCC 5.4.0] on linux2; >>>> import cppyy_compat, cppyy; >>>>.

Deployability,"`-L`` to locate; those extra ones, depending on your distribution. Most of the time, what you want is to have a native compiler to the; platform itself, but not others. So there's rarely a point in compiling; all back-ends. For that reason, you should also set the; ``TARGETS_TO_BUILD`` to only build the back-end you're targeting to. You must set the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``, otherwise a ``ninja install``; will copy ARM binaries to your root filesystem, which is not what you; want. Hacks; -----. There are some bugs in current LLVM, which require some fiddling before; running CMake:. #. If you're using Clang as the cross-compiler, there is a problem in; the LLVM ARM back-end that is producing absolute relocations on; position-independent code (``R_ARM_THM_MOVW_ABS_NC``), so for now, you; should disable PIC:. .. code-block:: bash. -DLLVM_ENABLE_PIC=False. This is not a problem, since Clang/LLVM libraries are statically; linked anyway, it shouldn't affect much. #. The ARM libraries won't be installed in your system.; But the CMake prepare step, which checks for; dependencies, will check the *host* libraries, not the *target*; ones. Below there's a list of some dependencies, but your project could; have more, or this document could be outdated. You'll see the errors; while linking as an indication of that. Debian based distros have a way to add ``multiarch``, which adds; a new architecture and allows you to install packages for those; systems. See https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/HOWTO for more info. But not all distros will have that, and possibly not an easy way to; install them in any anyway, so you'll have to build/download; them separately. A quick way of getting the libraries is to download them from; a distribution repository, like Debian (http://packages.debian.org/jessie/),; and download the missing libraries.

Deployability,"`Instruction Selection; DAGs <SelectionDAG>`. In many cases, while debugging various parts of the; compiler, it is nice to instantly visualize these graphs. LLVM provides several callbacks that are available in a debug build to do; exactly that. If you call the ``Function::viewCFG()`` method, for example, the; current LLVM tool will pop up a window containing the CFG for the function where; each basic block is a node in the graph, and each node contains the instructions; in the block. Similarly, there also exists ``Function::viewCFGOnly()`` (does; not include the instructions), the ``MachineFunction::viewCFG()`` and; ``MachineFunction::viewCFGOnly()``, and the ``SelectionDAG::viewGraph()``; methods. Within GDB, for example, you can usually use something like ``call; DAG.viewGraph()`` to pop up a window. Alternatively, you can sprinkle calls to; these functions in your code in places you want to debug. Getting this to work requires a small amount of setup. On Unix systems; with X11, install the `graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org>`_ toolkit, and make; sure 'dot' and 'gv' are in your path. If you are running on macOS, download; and install the macOS `Graphviz program; <http://www.pixelglow.com/graphviz/>`_ and add; ``/Applications/Graphviz.app/Contents/MacOS/`` (or wherever you install it) to; your path. The programs need not be present when configuring, building or; running LLVM and can simply be installed when needed during an active debug; session. ``SelectionDAG`` has been extended to make it easier to locate *interesting*; nodes in large complex graphs. From gdb, if you ``call DAG.setGraphColor(node,; ""color"")``, then the next ``call DAG.viewGraph()`` would highlight the node in; the specified color (choices of colors can be found at `colors; <http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/colors.html>`_.)

Bitcode files for LLVM IR may also be wrapped in a native object file; (i.e. ELF, COFF, Mach-O). The bitcode must be stored in a section of the object; file named ``__LLVM,__bitcode`` for MachO or ``.llvmbc`` for the other object; formats. ELF objects additionally support a ``.llvm.lto`` section for; :doc:`FatLTO`, which contains bitcode suitable for LTO compilation (i.e. bitcode; that has gone through a pre-link LTO pipeline). The ``.llvmbc`` section; predates FatLTO support in LLVM, and may not always contain bitcode that is; suitable for LTO (i.e. from ``-fembed-bitcode``). The wrapper format is useful; for accommodating LTO in compilation pipelines where intermediate objects must; be native object files which contain metadata in other sections. . Not all tools support this format. For example, lld and the gold plugin will; ignore the ``.llvmbc`` section when linking object files, but can use; ``.llvm.lto`` sections when passed the correct command line options. .. _encoding of LLVM IR:.

The JIT linker concept was introduced in LLVM's earlier generation of JIT APIs,; MCJIT. In MCJIT the *RuntimeDyld* component enabled re-use of LLVM as an; in-memory compiler by adding an in-memory link step to the end of the usual; compiler pipeline. Rather than dumping relocatable objects to disk as a compiler; usually would, MCJIT passed them to RuntimeDyld to be linked into a target; process. This approach to linking differs from standard *static* or *dynamic* linking:. A *static linker* takes one or more relocatable object files as input and links; them into an executable or dynamic library on disk. A *dynamic linker* applies relocations to executables and dynamic libraries that; have been loaded into memory. A *JIT linker* takes a single relocatable object file at a time and links it; into a target process, usually using a context object to allow the linked code; to resolve symbols in the target.

Deployability,"`black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ utility, which is PEP 8 compliant.; Use its default rules. For example, avoid specifying ``--line-length`` even; though it does not default to 80. The default rules can change between major; versions of black. In order to avoid unnecessary churn in the formatting rules,; we currently use black version 23.x in LLVM. When contributing a patch unrelated to formatting, you should format only the; Python code that the patch modifies. For this purpose, use the `darker; <https://pypi.org/project/darker/>`_ utility, which runs default black rules; over only the modified Python code. Doing so should ensure the patch will pass; the Python format checks in LLVM's pre-commit CI, which also uses darker. When; contributing a patch specifically for reformatting Python files, use black,; which currently only supports formatting entire files. Here are some quick examples, but see the black and darker documentation for; details:. .. code-block:: bash. $ pip install black=='23.*' darker # install black 23.x and darker; $ darker test.py # format uncommitted changes; $ darker -r HEAD^ test.py # also format changes from last commit; $ black test.py # format entire file. Instead of individual file names, you can specify directories to; darker, and it will find the changed files. However, if a directory is; large, like a clone of the LLVM repository, darker can be painfully; slow. In that case, you might wish to use git to list changed files.; For example:. .. code-block:: bash. $ darker -r HEAD^ $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=d HEAD^).

This is done by adding the ``ns_consumed`` attribute to; the parameter declaration, like so:. .. code-block:: objc. void foo(__attribute((ns_consumed)) id x);; - (void) foo: (id) __attribute((ns_consumed)) x;. This attribute is part of the type of the function or method, not the type of; the parameter. It controls only how the argument is passed and received. When passing such an argument, ARC retains the argument prior to making the; call. When receiving such an argument, ARC releases the argument at the end of the; function, subject to the usual optimizations for local values. .. admonition:: Rationale. This formalizes direct transfers of ownership from a caller to a callee. The; most common scenario here is passing the ``self`` parameter to ``init``, but; it is useful to generalize. Typically, local optimization will remove any; extra retains and releases: on the caller side the retain will be merged with; a +1 source, and on the callee side the release will be rolled into the; initialization of the parameter. The implicit ``self`` parameter of a method may be marked as consumed by adding; ``__attribute__((ns_consumes_self))`` to the method declaration. Methods in; the ``init`` :ref:`family <arc.method-families>` are treated as if they were; implicitly marked with this attribute. It is undefined behavior if an Objective-C message send to a method with; ``ns_consumed`` parameters (other than self) is made with a null receiver. It; is undefined behavior if the method to which an Objective-C message send; statically resolves to has a different set of ``ns_consumed`` parameters than; the method it dynamically resolves to.

In many cases it is necessary to send some local data to the remote; workers: it is very common, for instance, to distribute a local Grid; authentication proxy on the remote workers to let them authenticate to; access a data storage. The `payload` file must be an executable generating some output that; will be prepended to the remote environment preparation.

Custom lowering of intrinsics; ------------------------------. For GCs which use barriers or unusual treatment of stack roots, the; implementor is responsibly for providing a custom pass to lower the; intrinsics with the desired semantics. If you have opted in to custom; lowering of a particular intrinsic your pass **must** eliminate all; instances of the corresponding intrinsic in functions which opt in to; your GC. The best example of such a pass is the ShadowStackGC and it's; ShadowStackGCLowering pass. There is currently no way to register such a custom lowering pass; without building a custom copy of LLVM. .. _safe-points:. Generating safe points; -----------------------. LLVM provides support for associating stackmaps with the return address of; a call. Any loop or return safepoints required by a given collector design; can be modeled via calls to runtime routines, or potentially patchable call; sequences. Using gcroot, all call instructions are inferred to be possible; safepoints and will thus have an associated stackmap. .. _assembly:. Emitting assembly code: ``GCMetadataPrinter``; ---------------------------------------------. LLVM allows a plugin to print arbitrary assembly code before and after the rest; of a module's assembly code. At the end of the module, the GC can compile the; LLVM stack map into assembly code. (At the beginning, this information is not; yet computed.). Since AsmWriter and CodeGen are separate components of LLVM, a separate abstract; base class and registry is provided for printing assembly code, the; ``GCMetadaPrinter`` and ``GCMetadataPrinterRegistry``. The AsmWriter will look; for such a subclass if the ``GCStrategy`` sets ``UsesMetadata``:. .. code-block:: c++. MyGC::MyGC() {; UsesMetadata = true;; }.

Deployability,"a ""red zone"" region beyond the end of the stack). This region is; guaranteed to be preserved across interrupts and context switches, making the; return address used in returning to the current code remain on the stack and; valid to read. We can emit code in the caller to verify that a return edge was; not mispredicted:; ```; callq other_function; return_addr:; testq -8(%rsp), return_addr # Validate return address.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Update predicate state.; ```. For an ABI without a ""red zone"" (and thus unable to read the return address; from the stack), we can compute the expected return address prior to the call; into a register preserved across the call and use that similarly to the above. Indirect calls (and returns in the absence of a red zone ABI) pose the most; significant challenge to propagate. The simplest technique would be to define a; new ABI such that the intended call target is passed into the called function; and checked in the entry. Unfortunately, new ABIs are quite expensive to deploy; in C and C++. While the target function could be passed in TLS, we would still; require complex logic to handle a mixture of functions compiled with and; without this extra logic (essentially, making the ABI backwards compatible).; Currently, we suggest using retpolines here and will continue to investigate; ways of mitigating this. ##### Optimizations, Alternatives, and Tradeoffs. Merely accumulating predicate state involves significant cost. There are; several key optimizations we employ to minimize this and various alternatives; that present different tradeoffs in the generated code. First, we work to reduce the number of instructions used to track the state:; * Rather than inserting a `cmovCC` instruction along every conditional edge in; the original program, we track each set of condition flags we need to capture; prior to entering each basic block and reuse a common `cmovCC` sequence for; those.; * We could further reuse suffixes when there are multiple `cmov",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:20201,deploy,deploy,20201,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['deploy'],['deploy']

Previously, it was also run eagerly at the point of calling, that; is in the main user process. This is done to better separate the user driver environment and the worker environments. If; necessary, the function passed to `initialize` can be called directly by the user in the main application to reproduce; the same effect as before.; * Some internal details of the `RDataFrame` implementation were reworked to decrease memory usage and runtime of programs; with very deep computation graphs (more than O(10K) nodes in the same branch).

Deployability,"a ROOT call is not owned, but before it; passes to the Python interpreter, its ""must cleanup"" bit is set if; its type is a class derived from **`TObject`**. When the object goes; out of scope on the C++ side, the Python object will change type; into an object that largely behaves like None. The strict policy differs in that it will never relinquish ownership; when passing an object as a parameter to a function. It is then up to; the developer to prevent double deletes. Choosing one or the other; policy is done by:. ``` {.cpp}; ROOT.SetMemoryPolicy( ROOT.kMemoryStrict ); ```. for the strict policy, or for the heuristic policy:. ``` {.cpp}; ROOT.SetMemoryPolicy( ROOT.kMemoryHeuristics ); ```. Care must be taken in the case of graphic objects: when drawn on the; current pad, a reference to the graphics is kept that `PyROOT` isn't; currently aware of, and it is up to the developer to keep at lease one; Python reference alive. See `$ROOTSYS/tutorials/pyroot/zdemo.py`; (available in the latest release) for an example. Alternatively, one can; tell python to give up ownership for individual instances:. ``` {.cpp}; o = ROOT.TObject(); ROOT.SetOwnership( o, False ) # True to own, False to release; ```. #### Memory Management by Hand.

As such, we tend to make much heavier; use of reverts to keep the tree healthy than some other open source projects,; and our norms are a bit different. How should you respond if someone reverted your change?. * Remember, it is normal and healthy to have patches reverted. Having a patch; reverted does not necessarily mean you did anything wrong.; * We encourage explicitly thanking the person who reverted the patch for doing; the task on your behalf.; * If you need more information to address the problem, please follow up in the; original commit thread with the reverting patch author. When should you revert your own change?. * Any time you learn of a serious problem with a change, you should revert it.; We strongly encourage ""revert to green"" as opposed to ""fixing forward"". We; encourage reverting first, investigating offline, and then reapplying the; fixed patch - possibly after another round of review if warranted.; * If you break a buildbot in a way which can't be quickly fixed, please revert.; * If a test case that demonstrates a problem is reported in the commit thread,; please revert and investigate offline.; * If you receive substantial :ref:`post-commit review <post_commit_review>`; feedback, please revert and address said feedback before recommitting.; (Possibly after another round",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst:18915,patch,patch,18915,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,1,['patch'],['patch']

Within this section, the word :arc-term:`function` will be used to; refer to any structured unit of code, be it a C function, an; Objective-C method, or a block. This specification describes ARC as performing specific ``retain`` and; ``release`` operations on retainable object pointers at specific; points during the execution of a program. These operations make up a; non-contiguous subsequence of the computation history of the program.; The portion of this sequence for a particular retainable object; pointer for which a specific function execution is directly; responsible is the :arc-term:`formal local retain history` of the; object pointer. The corresponding actual sequence executed is the; `dynamic local retain history`. However, under certain circumstances, ARC is permitted to re-order and; eliminate operations in a manner which may alter the overall; computation history beyond what is permitted by the general ""as if""; rule of C/C++ and the :ref:`restrictions <arc.objects.retains>` on; the implementation of ``retain`` and ``release``. .. admonition:: Rationale. Specifically, ARC is sometimes permitted to optimize ``release``; operations in ways which might cause an object to be deallocated; before it would otherwise be.

Deployability,"a custom pass order to achieve optimal performance. A; couple specific suggestions:. #. For languages with numerous rarely executed guard conditions (e.g. null; checks, type checks, range checks) consider adding an extra execution or; two of LoopUnswitch and LICM to your pass order. The standard pass order,; which is tuned for C and C++ applications, may not be sufficient to remove; all dischargeable checks from loops. #. If your language uses range checks, consider using the IRCE pass. It is not; currently part of the standard pass order. #. A useful sanity check to run is to run your optimized IR back through the; -O2 pipeline again. If you see noticeable improvement in the resulting IR,; you likely need to adjust your pass order. I Still Can't Find What I'm Looking For; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If you didn't find what you were looking for above, consider proposing a piece; of metadata which provides the optimization hint you need. Such extensions are; relatively common and are generally well received by the community. You will; need to ensure that your proposal is sufficiently general so that it benefits; others if you wish to contribute it upstream.

Steps To Add Builder To LLVM Buildbot; =====================================; Volunteers can provide their build machines to work as build workers to; public LLVM Buildbot. Here are the steps you can follow to do so:. #. Check the existing build configurations to make sure the one you are; interested in is not covered yet or gets built on your computer much; faster than on the existing one. We prefer faster builds so developers; will get feedback sooner after changes get committed. #. The computer you will be registering with the LLVM buildbot; infrastructure should have all dependencies installed and be able to; build your configuration successfully. Please check what degree; of parallelism (-j param) would give the fastest build. You can build; multiple configurations on one computer. #. Install buildbot-worker (currently we are using buildbot version 2.8.4).; This specific version can be installed using ``pip``, with a command such; as ``pip3 install buildbot-worker==2.8.4``. #. Create a designated user account, your buildbot-worker will be running under,; and set appropriate permissions. #. Choose the buildbot-worker root directory (all builds will be placed under; it), buildbot-worker access name and password the build master will be using; to authenticate your buildbot-worker. #. Create a buildbot-worker in context of that buildbot-worker account. Point it; to the **lab.llvm.org** port **9994** (see `Buildbot documentation,; Creating a worker; <http://docs.buildbot.net/current/tutorial/firstrun.html#creating-a-worker>`_; for more details) by running the following command:. .. code-block:: bash. $ buildbot-worker create-worker <buildbot-worker-root-directory> \; lab.llvm.org:9994 \; <buildbot-worker-access-name> \; <buildbot-worker-access-password>.

No illegal operations must remain or be introduced after this pass. Register Bank Selector. All virtual registers must have a register bank assigned after this pass. Instruction Select. No gMIR must remain or be introduced after this pass. In other words, we must; have completed the conversion from gMIR to MIR. In addition to these passes, there are also some optional passes that perform; an optimization. The current optional passes are:. Combiner.

This type of conversion cannot be handled by normal; CastExprs because it requires an extra subexpression(s) to provide the bounds; information necessary to create a wide pointer. Bounds check expression; =======================. Bounds checks are part of semantics defined in the ``-fbounds-safety`` language; model. Hence, exposing the bounds checks and other semantic actions in the AST; is desirable. A new expression for bounds checks has been added to the AST. The; bounds check expression has a ``BoundsCheckKind`` to indicate the kind of checks; and has the additional sub-expressions that are necessary to perform the check; according to the kind. Paired assignment check; =======================. ``-fbounds-safety`` enforces that variables or fields related with the same; external bounds annotation (e.g., ``buf`` and ``count`` related with; ``__counted_by`` in the example below) must be updated side by side within the; same basic block and without side effect in between. .. code-block:: c. typedef struct {; int *__counted_by(count) buf; size_t count;; } sized_buf_t;. void alloc_buf(sized_buf_t *sbuf, sized_t nelems) {; sbuf->buf = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * nelems);; sbuf->count = nelems;; }. To implement this rule, the compiler requires a linear representation of; statements to understand the ordering and the adjacency between the two or more; assignments. The Clang CFG is used to implement this analysis as Clang CFG; provides a linear view of statements within each ``CFGBlock`` (Clang; ``CFGBlock`` represents a single basic block in a source-level CFG).

When we insert the conditional moves, the code ends up looking; like the following:; ```; # %bb.0: # %entry; pushq %rax; xorl %eax, %eax # Zero out initial predicate state.; movq $-1, %r8 # Put all-ones mask into a register.; testl %edi, %edi; jne .LBB0_1; # %bb.2: # %then1; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; testl %esi, %esi; jne .LBB0_1; # %bb.3: # %then2; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; testl %edx, %edx; je .LBB0_4; .LBB0_1:; cmoveq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; popq %rax; retq; .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; ```. Here we create the ""empty"" or ""correct execution"" predicate state by zeroing; `%rax`, and we create a constant ""incorrect execution"" predicate value by; putting `-1` into `%r8`. Then, along each edge coming out of a conditional; branch we do a conditional move that in a correct execution will be a no-op,; but if misspeculated, will replace the `%rax` with the value of `%r8`.; Misspeculating any one of the three predicates will cause `%rax` to hold the; ""incorrect execution"" value from `%r8` as we preserve incoming values when; execution is correct rather than overwriting it. We now have a value in `%rax` in each basic block that indicates if at some; point previously a predicate was mispredicted. And we have arranged for that; value to be particular",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:16777,update,update,16777,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['update'],['update']
Deployability,"a; system somewhere in between these two extremes: Dynamic application ; behavior and social constraints. From a technical perspective, pure static compilation cannot ever give ; optimal performance in all cases, because applications have varying dynamic; behavior that the static compiler cannot take into consideration. Even ; compilers that support profile guided optimization generate poor code in ; the real world, because using such optimization tunes that application ; to one particular usage pattern, whereas real programs (as opposed to ; benchmarks) often have several different usage patterns. On a social level, static compilation is a very shortsighted solution to ; the performance problem. Instruction set architectures (ISAs) continuously ; evolve, and each implementation of an ISA (a processor) must choose a set ; of tradeoffs that make sense in the market context that it is designed for. ; With every new processor introduced, the vendor faces two fundamental ; problems: First, there is a lag time between when a processor is introduced ; to when compilers generate quality code for the architecture. Secondly, ; even when compilers catch up to the new architecture there is often a large ; body of legacy code that was compiled for previous generations and will ; not or can not be upgraded. Thus a large percentage of code running on a ; processor may be compiled quite sub-optimally for the current ; characteristics of the dynamic execution environment. For these reasons, LLVM has been designed from the beginning as a long-term ; solution to these problems. Its design allows the large body of platform ; independent, static, program optimizations currently in compilers to be ; reused unchanged in their current form. It also provides important static ; type information to enable powerful dynamic and link time optimizations ; to be performed quickly and efficiently. This combination enables an ; increase in effective system performance for real world environments.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HistoricalNotes/2001-04-16-DynamicCompilation.txt:2346,upgrade,upgraded,2346,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HistoricalNotes/2001-04-16-DynamicCompilation.txt,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HistoricalNotes/2001-04-16-DynamicCompilation.txt,1,['upgrade'],['upgraded']

In particular this means that several I/O operations (including TDirectory::Write) are thread safe (as long as all the required TClass and TStreamerInfo has been previously setup).; Note: This model does not support sharing TFile amongst threads (i.e. a TFile must be accessed from exactly one thread). This means that whenever a TFile's control is passed from a thread to another, the code must explicitly reset gDirectory to another value or there is a risk for this gDirectory to point to a stale pointer if the other thread deletes the TFile object. A TFile deletion will only affect the value of the local gDirectory and gFile. TMemFile; Introduce TMemFile and update TFileMerger to support incremental merges.

A change in the argument handling of `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` and `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` might need your attention:; these macros now respect whether a header file was passed with its full relative path (the common case), or with a full path.; The latter allows to find headers at runtime - at the cost of a loss of relocatability: you cannot move the library containing; that dictionary to a different directory, because the header location is stored in the dictionary. This case is used by roottest; but should likely not be used by anything but test suites. Instead pass relative paths, together with a `-I` option to find the headers, plus setting `ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH` for finding the; headers back at runtime. The ROOT stress suite is now updated to follow this behavior; see for instance the injection of; `$ROOTSYS/test` in `test/stressMathCore.cxx`, allowing ROOT to find the header at runtime, whether interpreted; (`R__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH`) or compiled (`TROOT::AddExtraInterpreterArgs({""-I...""})` before interpreter construction). If you called `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/subdir/Header1.h LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` then update that; call to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict Header1.h OPTIONS -I subdir LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` *if* the header is usually included as; `#include ""Header1.h""`, or to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict subdir/Header1.h LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` *if* the header is usually; included as `#include ""subdir/Header1.h""`. I.e. the general rule is: pass to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` (or; `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`) the spelling as `#include`ed. As an important side-effect, `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` and thus `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` now *require* the header to; be found at configuration time.

By now, these mechanisms are well proven with commercial java; implementation with a fully relocating collector having shipped using them.; There are a couple places where bugs might still linger; these are called out; below.

If your use case is such; that you need some form of forward compatibility guarantee, please raise the; issue on the llvm-dev mailing list.

Overview & Core Concepts; ========================. To collect dead objects, garbage collectors must be able to identify; any references to objects contained within executing code, and,; depending on the collector, potentially update them. The collector; does not need this information at all points in code - that would make; the problem much harder - but only at well-defined points in the; execution known as 'safepoints' For most collectors, it is sufficient; to track at least one copy of each unique pointer value. However, for; a collector which wishes to relocate objects directly reachable from; running code, a higher standard is required. One additional challenge is that the compiler may compute intermediate; results (""derived pointers"") which point outside of the allocation or; even into the middle of another allocation. The eventual use of this; intermediate value must yield an address within the bounds of the; allocation, but such ""exterior derived pointers"" may be visible to the; collector.

Stand-alone Builds; ------------------. Stand-alone builds allow you to build a sub-project against a pre-built; version of the clang or llvm libraries that is already present on your; system. You can use the source code from a standard checkout of the llvm-project; (as described above) to do stand-alone builds, but you may also build; from a :ref:`sparse checkout<workflow-multicheckout-nocommit>` or from the; tarballs available on the `releases <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/>`_; page. For stand-alone builds, you must have an llvm install that is configured; properly to be consumable by stand-alone builds of the other projects.; This could be a distro provided LLVM install, or you can build it yourself,; like this:. .. code-block:: console. cmake -G Ninja -S path/to/llvm-project/llvm -B $builddir \; -DLLVM_INSTALL_UTILS=ON \; -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/llvm/install/prefix \; < other options >. ninja -C $builddir install.

After adjusting libc++ to work with the changes, the next revision will be; tested by libc++'s; pre-commit CI. For most configurations, the pre-commit CI uses a recent; nightly build of Clang from LLVM's main; branch. These configurations do not use the Clang changes in the; patch. They only use the libc++ changes.; The ""Bootstrapping build"" builds Clang and uses it to build and; test libc++.

Information about CUDA; programming can be found in the; `CUDA programming guide; <http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html>`_. Compiling CUDA Code; ===================. Prerequisites; -------------. CUDA is supported since llvm 3.9. Clang currently supports CUDA 7.0 through; 12.1. If clang detects a newer CUDA version, it will issue a warning and will; attempt to use detected CUDA SDK it as if it were CUDA 12.1. Before you build CUDA code, you'll need to have installed the CUDA SDK. See; `NVIDIA's CUDA installation guide; <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html>`_ for; details. Note that clang `maynot support; <https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26966>`_ the CUDA toolkit as installed by; some Linux package managers. Clang does attempt to deal with specific details of; CUDA installation on a handful of common Linux distributions, but in general the; most reliable way to make it work is to install CUDA in a single directory from; NVIDIA's `.run` package and specify its location via `--cuda-path=...` argument. CUDA compilation is supported on Linux. Compilation on MacOS and Windows may or; may not work and currently have no maintainers. Invoking clang; --------------. Invoking clang for CUDA compilation works similarly to compiling regular C++.; You just need to be aware of a few additional flags. You can use `this <https://gist.github.com/855e277884eb6b388cd2f00d956c2fd4>`_; program as a toy example. Save it as ``axpy.cu``. (Clang detects that you're; compiling CUDA code by noticing that your filename ends with ``.cu``.; Alternatively, you can pass ``-x cuda``.). To build and run, run the following commands, filling in the parts in angle; brackets as described below:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang++ axpy.cu -o axpy --cuda-gpu-arch=<GPU arch> \; -L<CUDA install path>/<lib64 or lib> \; -lcudart_static -ldl -l",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CompileCudaWithLLVM.rst:1158,install,installation,1158,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CompileCudaWithLLVM.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CompileCudaWithLLVM.rst,2,['install'],"['install', 'installation']"

But, as is true to any cross-compiler, and given the complexity of; different architectures, OS's and options, it's not always easy finding; the headers, libraries or binutils to generate target specific code.; So you'll need special options to help Clang understand what target; you're compiling to, where your tools are, etc. Another problem is that compilers come with standard libraries only (like; ``compiler-rt``, ``libcxx``, ``libgcc``, ``libm``, etc), so you'll have to; find and make available to the build system, every other library required; to build your software, that is specific to your target. It's not enough to; have your host's libraries installed. Finally, not all toolchains are the same, and consequently, not every Clang; option will work magically. Some options, like ``--sysroot`` (which; effectively changes the logical root for headers and libraries), assume; all your binaries and libraries are in the same directory, which may not; true when your cross-compiler was installed by the distribution's package; management. So, for each specific case, you may use more than one; option, and in most cases, you'll end up setting include paths (``-I``) and; library paths (``-L``) manually. To sum up, different toolchains can:; * be host/target specific or more flexible; * be in a single directory, or spread out across your system; * have different sets of libraries and headers by default; * need special options, which your build system won't be able to figure; out by itself.

In addition to simple scalar arguments,; the CommandLine library also provides primitives to support CommandLine option; `aliases`_, and `lists`_ of options. .. _aliases:. Argument Aliases; ----------------. So far, the example works well, except for the fact that we need to check the; quiet condition like this now:. .. code-block:: c++. ...; if (!Quiet && !Quiet2) printInformationalMessage(...);; ... ... which is a real pain! Instead of defining two values for the same; condition, we can use the ""`cl::alias`_"" class to make the ""``-q``"" option an; **alias** for the ""``-quiet``"" option, instead of providing a value itself:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<bool> Force (""f"", cl::desc(""Overwrite output files""));; cl::opt<bool> Quiet (""quiet"", cl::desc(""Don't print informational messages""));; cl::alias QuietA(""q"", cl::desc(""Alias for -quiet""), cl::aliasopt(Quiet));. The third line (which is the only one we modified from above) defines a ""``-q``""; alias that updates the ""``Quiet``"" variable (as specified by the `cl::aliasopt`_; modifier) whenever it is specified. Because aliases do not hold state, the only; thing the program has to query is the ``Quiet`` variable now. Another nice; feature of aliases is that they automatically hide themselves from the ``-help``; output (although, again, they are still visible in the ``-help-hidden output``). Now the application code can simply use:. .. code-block:: c++. ...; if (!Quiet) printInformationalMessage(...);; ... ... which is much nicer! The ""`cl::alias`_"" can be used to specify an; alternative name for any variable type, and has many uses. .. _unnamed alternatives using the generic parser:.

LinkGraph; =========. JITLink maps all relocatable object formats to a generic ``LinkGraph`` type; that is designed to make linking fast and easy (``LinkGraph`` instances can; also be created manually. See :ref:`constructing_linkgraphs`). Relocatable object formats (e.g. COFF, ELF, MachO) differ in their details,; but share a common goal: to represent machine level code and data with; annotations that allow them to be relocated in a virtual address space. To; this end they usually contain names (symbols) for content defined inside the; file or externally, chunks of content that must be moved as a unit (sections; or subsections, depending on the format), and annotations describing how to; patch content based on the final address of some target symbol/section; (relocations). At a high level, the ``LinkGraph`` type represents these concepts as a decorated; graph. Nodes in the graph represent symbols and content, and edges represent; relocations. Each of the elements of the graph is listed here:. * ``Addressable`` -- A node in the link graph that can be assigned an address; in the executor process's virtual address space. Absolute and external symbols are represented using plain ``Addressable``; instances. Content defined inside the object file is represented using the; ``Block`` subclass. * ``Block`` -- An ``Addressable`` node that has ``Content`` (or is marked as; zero-filled), a parent ``Section``, a ``Size``, an ``Alignment`` (and an; ``AlignmentOffset``), and a list of ``Edge`` instances.

If you are interested, you can test it; on your favourite platform and email me the results. Depending on the package manager of your distro, you can install the; packages required by CPT to build RPM bundles.

Instrumentation code outlining; ------------------------------. By default AddressSanitizer inlines the instrumentation code to improve the; run-time performance, which leads to increased binary size. Using the; (clang flag ``-fsanitize-address-outline-instrumentation` default: ``false``); flag forces all code instrumentation to be outlined, which reduces the size; of the generated code, but also reduces the run-time performance. Limitations; ===========. * AddressSanitizer uses more real memory than a native run. Exact overhead; depends on the allocations sizes. The smaller the allocations you make the; bigger the overhead is.; * AddressSanitizer uses more stack memory. We have seen up to 3x increase.; * On 64-bit platforms AddressSanitizer maps (but not reserves) 16+ Terabytes of; virtual address space. This means that tools like ``ulimit`` may not work as; usually expected.; * Static linking of executables is not supported. Supported Platforms; ===================. AddressSanitizer is supported on:. * Linux i386/x86\_64 (tested on Ubuntu 12.04); * macOS 10.7 - 10.11 (i386/x86\_64); * iOS Simulator; * Android ARM; * NetBSD i386/x86\_64; * FreeBSD i386/x86\_64 (tested on FreeBSD 11-current); * Windows 8.1+ (i386/x86\_64). Ports to various other platforms are in progress. Current Status; ==============. AddressSanitizer is fully functional on supported platforms starting from LLVM; 3.1. The test suite is integrated into CMake build and can be run with ``make; check-asan`` command. The Windows port is functional and is used by Chrome and Firefox, but it is not; as well supported as the other ports.

RooFit groups model variables into *observables* and *parameters*, depending on if their values are stored in the dataset.; For fits with parameter constraints, there is a third kind of variables, called *global observables*.; These represent the results of auxiliary measurements that constrain the nuisance parameters.; In the RooFit implementation, a likelihood is generally the sum of two terms:; * the likelihood of the data given the parameters, where the normalization set is the set of observables (implemented by `RooNLLVar`); * the constraint term, where the normalization set is the set of *global observables* (implemented by `RooConstraintSum`). Before this release, the global observable values were always taken from the model/pdf.; With this release, a mechanism is added to store a snapshot of global observables in any `RooDataSet` or `RooDataHist`.; For toy studies where the global observables assume a different values for each toy, the bookkeeping of the set of global observables and in particular their values is much easier with this change. Usage example for a model with global observables `g1` and `g2`:; ```C++; auto data = model.generate(x, 1000); // data has only the single observables x; data->setGlobalObservables(g1, g2); // now, data also stores a snapshot of g1 and g2. // If you fit the model to the data, the global observables and their values; // are taken from the dataset:; model.fitTo(*data);. // You can still define the set of global observables yourself, but the values; // will be takes from the dataset if available:; model.fitTo(*data, GlobalObservables(g1, g2));. // To force `fitTo` to take the global observable values from the model even; // though they are in the dataset, you can use the new `GlobalObservablesSource`; // command argument:; model.fitT",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md:27557,release,release,27557,README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,1,['release'],['release']

Each additional style option adds costs to the clang-format project. Some of; these costs affect the clang-format development itself, as we need to make; sure that any given combination of options work and that new features don't; break any of the existing options in any way. There are also costs for end users; as options become less discoverable and people have to think about and make a; decision on options they don't really care about. The goal of the clang-format project is more on the side of supporting a; limited set of styles really well as opposed to supporting every single style; used by a codebase somewhere in the wild. Of course, we do want to support all; major projects and thus have established the following bar for adding style; options. Each new style option must .. * be used in a project of significant size (have dozens of contributors); * have a publicly accessible style guide; * have a person willing to contribute and maintain patches.

This is mainly used for; pointers to incomplete types or types without size such as ``void *``.; * ``__ended_by(P)`` : The pointer has the upper bound of value ``P``, which is; one past the last element of the pointer. In other words, this annotation; describes a range that starts with the pointer that has this annotation and; ends with ``P`` which is the argument of the annotation. ``P`` itself may be; annotated with ``__ended_by(Q)``. In this case, the end of the range extends; to the pointer ``Q``. This is used for ""iterator"" support in C where you're; iterating from one pointer value to another until a final pointer value is; reached (and the final pointer value is not dereferencable). Accessing a pointer outside the specified bounds causes a run-time trap or a; compile-time error. Also, the model maintains correctness of bounds annotations; when the pointer and/or the related value containing the bounds information are; updated or passed as arguments. This is done by compile-time restrictions or; run-time checks (see `Maintaining correctness of bounds annotations`_; for more detail). For instance, initializing ``buf`` with ``null`` while; assigning non-zero value to ``count``, as shown in the following example, would; violate the ``__counted_by`` annotation because a null pointer does not point to; any valid memory location. To avoid this, the compiler produces either a; compile-time error or run-time trap. .. code-block:: c. void null_with_count_10(int *__counted_by(count) buf, unsigned count) {; buf = 0;; // This is not allowed as it creates a null pointer with non-zero length; count = 10;; }. However, there are use cases where a pointer is either a null pointer or is; pointing to memory of the specified size.

In above example, ``runOnFunction`` for ``DominatorTree`` is called by pass; manager before returning a reference to the desired pass.

It is now possible to create running integrals from any RooAbsReal function and; to create cumulative distribution functions from any RooAbsPdf using the following; methods:. // Create int[xlo,x] f(x') dx' from f(x); RooAbsReal* runInt = func.createRunningIntegral(x) ;. // Create int[xlo,x] f(x') dx' from p.d.f f(x) normalized over x; RooAbsReal* cdf = pdf.createCdf(x) ;. // Create int[xlo,x] f(x',y) dx' from p.d.f f(x,y) normalized over (x,y); RooAbsReal* cdf = pdf.createCdf(x,y) ;. ; As with the similarly styled function createIntegral running integrals and c.d.f. can be created; over any number of observables, e.g createCdf(RooArgSet(x,y,z)) will create a three-dimensional; cumulative distribution function. C.d.f and running integrals that are calculated from p.d.fs that have; support for analytical integration are constructed from an appropriately reconnected RooRealIntegral.; If numeric integration is required, the c.d.f or running integral is calculated by a dedicated class; RooRunningIntegral that precalculates results for all observable values, which is more efficient; in most use cases. Cumulative distributions functions that are calculated numerically are handled slightly differently; that standard running integrals: their values is constructed to converge to exactly zero at the lower bound; and exactly 1 at the upper bound so that algorithms that make use of that property of c.d.f can do so reliably. Constraints management. New tools have been added to simplify studies with fits involving (external) constraints on parameters.; The general philosophy is that constraints on parameters can be represented as probability density functions; and can thus be modeled by RooAbsPdf classes (e.g. a RooGaussian for a simple Gaussian constraint on a parameter).; There are two modes of operation: you can add parameter constraints to your problem definition by multiplying; the constrain",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v520/index.html:6049,integrat,integration,6049,roofit/doc/v520/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v520/index.html,2,['integrat'],['integration']

The octopus merge is suboptimal for many cases, because walking back; through the history of one component leaves the other components fixed; at a history that likely makes things unbuildable. Some downstream users track the order commits were made to subprojects; with some kind of ""umbrella"" project that imports the project git; mirrors as submodules, similar to the multirepo umbrella proposed; above. Such an umbrella repository looks something like this::. UM1 ---- UM2 -- UM3 -- UM4 ---- UM5 ---- UM6 ---- UM7 ---- UM8 <- main; | | | | | | |; Lllvm1 Llld1 Lclang1 Lclang2 Lllvm2 Llld2 Lmyproj1. The vertical bars represent submodule updates to a particular local; commit in the project mirror. ``UM3`` in this case is a commit of; some local umbrella repository state that is not a submodule update,; perhaps a ``README`` or project build script update. Commit ``UM8``; updates a submodule of local project ``myproj``. The tool ``zip-downstream-fork.py`` at; https://github.com/greened/llvm-git-migration/tree/zip can be used to; convert the umbrella history into a monorepo-based history with; commits in the order implied by submodule updates::.

The ``U*`` commits represent upstream commits to the monorepo main; branch. Each submodule update in the local ``UM*`` commits brought in; a subproject tree at some local commit. The trees in the ``L*1``; commits represent merges from upstream. These result in edges from; the ``U*`` commits to their corresponding rewritten ``L*1`` commits.; The ``L*2`` commits did not do any merges from upstream.

The previous method was to include ""Patch by John Doe.""; in a separate line of the commit message and there are automated processes that; rely on this format. .. _IR backwards compatibility:. IR Backwards Compatibility; --------------------------. When the IR format has to be changed, keep in mind that we try to maintain some; backwards compatibility. The rules are intended as a balance between convenience; for llvm users and not imposing a big burden on llvm developers:. * The textual format is not backwards compatible. We don't change it too often,; but there are no specific promises. * Additions and changes to the IR should be reflected in; ``test/Bitcode/compatibility.ll``. * The current LLVM version supports loading any bitcode since version 3.0. * After each X.Y release, ``compatibility.ll`` must be copied to; ``compatibility-X.Y.ll``. The corresponding bitcode file should be assembled; using the X.Y build and committed as ``compatibility-X.Y.ll.bc``. * Newer releases can ignore features from older releases, but they cannot; miscompile them. For example, if nsw is ever replaced with something else,; dropping it would be a valid way to upgrade the IR. * Debug metadata is special in that it is currently dropped during upgrades. * Non-debug metadata is defined to be safe to drop, so a valid way to upgrade; it is to drop it. That is not very user friendly and a bit more effort is; expected, but no promises are made. C API Changes; -------------. * Stability Guarantees: The C API is, in general, a ""best effort"" for stability.; This means that we make every attempt to keep the C API stable, but that; stability will be limited by the abstractness of the interface and the; stability of the C++ API that it wraps.

If it is likely that others will want to review a recently-posted patch,; especially if there might be objections, but no one else has done so yet, it is; also polite to provide a qualified approval (e.g., ""LGTM, but please wait for a; couple of days in case others wish to review""). If approval is received very; quickly, a patch author may also elect to wait before committing (and this is; certainly considered polite for non-trivial patches). Especially given the; global nature of our community, this waiting time should be at least 24 hours.; Please also be mindful of weekends and major holidays.

In this case, the; release note should be added to a ``Potentially Breaking Changes`` section of; the notes with sufficient information and examples to demonstrate the; potential disruption.

The patch point intrinsic generates a stack map. It also emits a; function call to the address specified by ``<target>`` if the address; is not a constant null. The function call and its arguments are; lowered according to the calling convention specified at the; intrinsic's callsite. Variants of the intrinsic with non-void return; type also return a value according to calling convention. On PowerPC, note that ``<target>`` must be the ABI function pointer for the; intended target of the indirect call. Specifically, when compiling for the; ELF V1 ABI, ``<target>`` is the function-descriptor address normally used as; the C/C++ function-pointer representation. Requesting zero patch point arguments is valid. In this case, all; variable operands are handled just like; ``llvm.experimental.stackmap.*``. The difference is that space will; still be reserved for patching, a call will be emitted, and a return; value is allowed. The location of the arguments are not normally recorded in the stack; map because they are already fixed by the calling convention. The; remaining ``live values`` will have their location recorded, which; could be a register, stack location, or constant. A special calling; convention has been introduced for use with stack maps, anyregcc,; which forces the arguments to be loaded into registers but allows; those register to be dynamically allocated. These argument registers; will have their register locations recorded in the stack map in; addition to the remaining ``live values``. The patch point also emits nops to cover at least ``<numBytes>`` of; instruction encoding space. Hence, the client must ensure that; ``<numBytes>`` is enough to encode a call to the target address on the; supported targets.

Therefore,; non-ARC callers must ensure that such fields are initialized to a +1; reference, and non-ARC callees must balance that +1 by releasing the; reference or transferring it as appropriate. Likewise, a function returning a non-trivial struct may be written in; ARC and called from non-ARC or vice-versa. The convention for this; always transfers ownership of objects stored in ``__strong`` fields; from the callee to the caller, and so callees must initialize such; fields with +1 references, and callers must balance that +1 by releasing; or transferring them. Similar transfers of responsibility occur for ``__weak`` fields, but; since both sides must use native ``__weak`` support to ensure; calling convention compatibility, this transfer is always handled; automatically by the compiler. .. admonition:: Rationale. In earlier releases, when non-trivial ownership was only permitted; on fields in Objective-C++, the ABI used for such classes was the; ordinary ABI for non-trivial C++ classes, which passes arguments and; returns indirectly and does not transfer responsibility for arguments.; When support for Objective-C structs was added, it was decided to; change to the current ABI for three reasons:. - It permits ARC / non-ARC compatibility for structs containing only; ``__strong`` references, as long as the non-ARC side is careful about; transferring ownership. - It avoids unnecessary indirection for sufficiently small types that; the C ABI would prefer to pass in registers. - Given that struct arguments must be produced at +1 to satisfy C's; semantics of initializing the local parameter variable, transferring; ownership of that copy to the callee is generally better for ARC; optimization, since otherwise there will be releases in the caller; that are much harder to pair with transfers in the callee.

To retrieve a later instance you can; use `GetListOfPrimitives()`, which returns a list of all the objects on; the pad. From the list you can select the object you need. #### Hiding an Object. Hiding an object in a pad can be made by removing it from the list of; objects owned by that pad. This list is accessible by the; `GetListOfPrimitives()` method of **`TPad`**. This method returns a; pointer to a **`TList`**. Suppose we get the pointer to the object, we; want to hide, call it `obj` (see paragraph above). We get the pointer to; the list:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] li = gPad->GetListOfPrimitives(); ```. Then remove the object from this list:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] li->Remove(obj); ```. The object will disappear from the pad as soon as the pad is updated; (try to resize it for example). If one wants to make the object; reappear:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] obj->Draw(); ```.

Rather than manually adding passes to a pass manager, the typical way of; creating a pass manager is to use a ``PassBuilder`` and call something like; ``PassBuilder::buildPerModuleDefaultPipeline()`` which creates a typical; pipeline for a given optimization level. Sometimes either frontends or backends will want to inject passes into the; pipeline.

For these; cases, ``PassBuilder`` exposes callbacks that allow injecting passes into; certain parts of the pipeline. For example,. .. code-block:: c++. PassBuilder PB;; PB.registerPipelineStartEPCallback([&](ModulePassManager &MPM,; PassBuilder::OptimizationLevel Level) {; MPM.addPass(FooPass());; };. will add ``FooPass`` near the very beginning of the pipeline for pass; managers created by that ``PassBuilder``. See the documentation for; ``PassBuilder`` for the various places that passes can be added. If a ``PassBuilder`` has a corresponding ``TargetMachine`` for a backend, it; will call ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` to allow the; backend to inject passes into the pipeline. Clang's ``BackendUtil.cpp`` shows examples of a frontend adding (mostly; sanitizer) passes to various parts of the pipeline.; ``AMDGPUTargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` is an example of a; backend adding passes to various parts of the pipeline.

It should be used as:. ```javascript; import { produceRenderOrder } from './path_to_jsroot/modules/geom/TGeoPainter.mjs';; produceRenderOrder(scene, camera.position, 'box');; ```. Following methods can be applied: ""box"", ""pnt"", ""size"", ""ray"" and ""dflt"". See more info in draw options description for TGeo classes.

There is [code example](https://github.com/root-project/jsroot/tree/master/demo/custom) how custom user class can be implemented.; It shows usage of different draw options for the class and ability to access sub-elements of the object using specialized `expand` function. ### Use with Node.js. To install latest JSROOT release, just do:. ```bash; [shell] npm install jsroot; ```. To use in the Node.js scripts, one should add following line:. ```javascript; import { httpRequest, makeSVG } from 'jsroot';; ```. Using JSROOT functionality, one can open binary ROOT files (local and remote), parse ROOT JSON,; create SVG output. For example, to create SVG image with lego plot, one should do:. ```javascript; import { openFile, makeSVG } from 'jsroot';; import { writeFileSync } from 'fs';. let file = await openFile(""https://root.cern/js/files/hsimple.root"");; let obj = await file.readObject(""hpx;1"");; let svg = await makeSVG({ object: obj, option: ""lego2"", width: 1200, height: 800 });; writeFileSync(""lego2.svg"", svg);; ```. It is also possible to convert any JavaScript object into ROOT JSON string, using `toJSON()` function.

Deployability,"at Tools Are Used for Code Review?; ------------------------------------. Pre-commit code reviews are conducted on GitHub with Pull Requests. See; :ref:`GitHub <github-reviews>` documentation. When Is an RFC Required?; ------------------------. Some changes are too significant for just a code review. Changes that should; change the LLVM Language Reference (e.g., adding new target-independent; intrinsics), adding language extensions in Clang, and so on, require an RFC; (Request for Comment) email on the project's ``*-dev`` mailing list first. For; changes that promise significant impact on users and/or downstream code bases,; reviewers can request an RFC achieving consensus before proceeding with code; review. That having been said, posting initial patches can help with; discussions on an RFC. Code-Review Workflow; ====================. Code review can be an iterative process, which continues until the patch is; ready to be committed. Specifically, once a patch is sent out for review, it; needs an explicit approval before it is committed. Do not assume silent; approval, or solicit objections to a patch with a deadline. Acknowledge All Reviewer Feedback; ---------------------------------. All comments by reviewers should be acknowledged by the patch author. It is; generally expected that suggested changes will be incorporated into a future; revision of the patch unless the author and/or other reviewers can articulate a; good reason to do otherwise (and then the reviewers must agree). If a new patch; does not address all outstanding feedback, the author should explicitly state; that when providing the updated patch. When using the web-based code-review; tool, such notes can be provided in the ""Diff"" description (which is different; from the description of the ""Differential Revision"" as a whole used for the; commit message).

The remainder of this section describes exceptions to these rules, how those; exceptions are detected, and what those exceptions imply semantically. .. _arc.objects.operands.consumed:. Consumed parameters; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A function or method parameter of retainable object pointer type may be marked; as :arc-term:`consumed`, signifying that the callee expects to take ownership; of a +1 retain count. This is done by adding the ``ns_consumed`` attribute to; the parameter declaration, like so:. .. code-block:: objc. void foo(__attribute((ns_consumed)) id x);; - (void) foo: (id) __attribute((ns_consumed)) x;. This attribute is part of the type of the function or method, not the type of; the parameter. It controls only how the argument is passed and received. When passing such an argument, ARC retains the argument prior to making the; call. When receiving such an argument, ARC releases the argument at the end of the; function, subject to the usual optimizations for local values. .. admonition:: Rationale. This formalizes direct transfers of ownership from a caller to a callee. The; most common scenario here is passing the ``self`` parameter to ``init``, but; it is useful to generalize. Typically, local optimization will remove any; extra retains and releases: on the caller side the retain will be merged with; a +1 source, and on the callee side the release will be rolled into the; initialization of the parameter. The implicit ``self`` parameter of a method may be marked as consumed by adding; ``__attribute__((ns_consumes_self))`` to the method declaration. Methods in; the ``init`` :ref:`family <arc.method-families>` are treated as if they were; implicitly marked with this attribute. It is undefined behavior if an Objective-C message send to a method with; ``ns_consumed`` parameters (other than self) is made with a null receiver.

If ``mylib.h`` depends on other headers, then they can be; stored within ``build/usr/include`` in a way that mimics the installed; location. Building a relocatable precompiled header requires two additional; arguments. First, pass the ``--relocatable-pch`` flag to indicate that; the resulting PCH file should be relocatable. Second, pass; ``-isysroot /path/to/build``, which makes all includes for your library; relative to the build directory. For example:. .. code-block:: console. # clang -x c-header --relocatable-pch -isysroot /path/to/build /path/to/build/mylib.h mylib.h.pch. When loading the relocatable PCH file, the various headers used in the; PCH file are found from the system header root. For example, ``mylib.h``; can be found in ``/usr/include/mylib.h``. If the headers are installed; in some other system root, the ``-isysroot`` option can be used provide; a different system root from which the headers will be based. For; example, ``-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk`` will look for; ``mylib.h`` in ``/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/include/mylib.h``.

It is represented by a path like: `/TOP\_1/A\_1/B\_3/C\_1`,; where `B\_3` for instance is a copy of volume `B` positioned inside; volume `A`. A state is always associated to a transformation matrix; `M` of the touchable with respect to the global reference frame; (obtained by piling-up all local transformations of nodes in the branch; with respect to their containers). The current state and the; corresponding global matrix are updated whenever the geometry depth is; modified. The global transformations corresponding to all nodes in the; current branch are kept in an array: (`MTOP\_1, MA\_1, MB\_3, ...`). \image html geometry015.png ""Navigation in the geometry hierarchy"" width=600px.

They; can be used independently (i.e. ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``; implicitly generates a stack map without the need for an additional; call to ``llvm.experimental.stackmap``). The choice of which to use; depends on whether it is necessary to reserve space for code patching; and whether any of the intrinsic arguments should be lowered according; to calling conventions. ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` does not; reserve any space, nor does it expect any call arguments. If the; runtime patches code at the stack map's address, it will destructively; overwrite the program text. This is unlike; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``, which reserves space for in-place; patching without overwriting surrounding code. The; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint`` intrinsic also lowers a specified; number of arguments according to its calling convention. This allows; patched code to make in-place function calls without marshaling. Each instance of one of these intrinsics generates a stack map record; in the :ref:`stackmap-section`.

While executing the whole; wavefront region, the conceptual execution mask is the saved value, not the; ``EXEC`` value. This is handled by defining an artificial variable for the active lane mask. The; active lane mask artificial variable would be the actual ``EXEC`` mask for; normal regions, and the saved execution mask for regions where the mask is; temporarily updated.

Deployability,"ay to tell analysis managers; when results are no longer valid. Much of the analysis manager complexity; comes from trying to invalidate as few analysis results as possible to keep; compile times as low as possible. There are two ways to deal with potentially invalid analysis results. One is; to simply force clear the results. This should generally only be used when; the IR that the result is keyed on becomes invalid. For example, a function; is deleted, or a CGSCC has become invalid due to call graph changes. The typical way to invalidate analysis results is for a pass to declare what; types of analyses it preserves and what types it does not. When transforming; IR, a pass either has the option to update analyses alongside the IR; transformation, or tell the analysis manager that analyses are no longer; valid and should be invalidated. If a pass wants to keep some specific; analysis up to date, such as when updating it would be faster than; invalidating and recalculating it, the analysis itself may have methods to; update it for specific transformations, or there may be helper updaters like; ``DomTreeUpdater`` for a ``DominatorTree``. Otherwise to mark some analysis; as no longer valid, the pass can return a ``PreservedAnalyses`` with the; proper analyses invalidated. .. code-block:: c++. // We've made no transformations that can affect any analyses.; return PreservedAnalyses::all();. // We've made transformations and don't want to bother to update any analyses.; return PreservedAnalyses::none();. // We've specifically updated the dominator tree alongside any transformations, but other analysis results may be invalid.; PreservedAnalyses PA;; PA.preserve<DominatorAnalysis>();; return PA;. // We haven't made any control flow changes, any analyses that only care about the control flow are still valid.; PreservedAnalyses PA;; PA.preserveSet<CFGAnalyses>();; return PA;.

For these; cases, ``PassBuilder`` exposes callbacks that allow injecting passes into; certain parts of the pipeline. For example,. .. code-block:: c++. PassBuilder PB;; PB.registerPipelineStartEPCallback([&](ModulePassManager &MPM,; PassBuilder::OptimizationLevel Level) {; MPM.addPass(FooPass());; };. will add ``FooPass`` near the very beginning of the pipeline for pass; managers created by that ``PassBuilder``. See the documentation for; ``PassBuilder`` for the various places that passes can be added. If a ``PassBuilder`` has a corresponding ``TargetMachine`` for a backend, it; will call ``TargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` to allow the; backend to inject passes into the pipeline. Clang's ``BackendUtil.cpp`` shows examples of a frontend adding (mostly; sanitizer) passes to various parts of the pipeline.; ``AMDGPUTargetMachine::registerPassBuilderCallbacks()`` is an example of a; backend adding passes to various parts of the pipeline. Pass plugins can also add passes into default pipelines. Different tools have; different ways of loading dynamic pass plugins. For example, ``opt; -load-pass-plugin=path/to/plugin.so`` loads a pass plugin into ``opt``. For; information on writing a pass plugin, see :doc:`WritingAnLLVMNewPMPass`. Using Analyses; ==============. LLVM provides many analyses that passes can use, such as a dominator tree.; Calculating these can be expensive, so the new pass manager has; infrastructure to cache analyses and reuse them when possible. When a pass runs on some IR, it also receives an analysis manager which it can; query for analyses. Querying for an analysis will cause the manager to check if; it has already computed the result for the requested IR. If it already has and; the result is still valid, it will return that. Otherwise it will construct a; new result by calling the analysis's ``run()`` method, cache it, and return it.;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst:6460,pipeline,pipeline,6460,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/NewPassManager.rst,1,['pipeline'],['pipeline']

This file is required since Clad will not be able to see anything that is not; inlined and explicitly available to it during compilation (since it has to be; in the same translation). So other than of generating these functions on the; fly, your only other option is to place these functions in a separate header; file and make them inline. Theoretically, multiple header files can also be used and then mashed; together. > Directory path: [roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooFit/Detail/MathFuncs.h](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/roofitcore/inc/RooFit/Detail/MathFuncs.h). ### Step 2.

Here we can see that the name of the variable `x` (remember that ""x"" is a; member of RooPoisson) is retrieved and stored in the `xName` variable. Next,; there's an `if` condition that does an operation on `x` (may or may not round; it to the nearest integer, depending on the condition). The important part is where the `RooPoisson::addResult()` function helps add; the result of evaluating the Poisson function to the context (`ctx`).

There is a demonstration page showing such functionality: <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm>.; This demo page reads in cycle 20 json files and displays them. If one has a web server which already provides such JSON file, one could specify the URL to this file like:. <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm?addr=../httpserver.C/Canvases/c1/root.json.gz>. Here the same problem with [Cross-Origin Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control) can appear. If the web server configuration cannot be changed, just copy JSROOT to the web server itself. ### Binary file-based monitoring (not recommended). Theoretically, one could use binary ROOT files to implement monitoring.; With such approach, a ROOT-based application creates and regularly updates content of a ROOT file, which can be accessed via normal web server. From the browser side, JSROOT could regularly read the specified objects and update their drawings. But such solution has three major caveats. First of all, one need to store the data of all objects, which only potentially could be displayed in the browser. In case of 10 objects it does not matter, but for 1000 or 100000 objects this will be a major performance penalty. With such big amount of data one will never achieve higher update rate. The second problem is I/O. To read the first object from the ROOT file, one need to perform several (about 5) file-reading operations via http protocol.; There is no http file locking mechanism (at least not for standard web servers),; therefore there is no guarantee that the file content is not changed/replaced between consequent read operations. Therefore, one should expect frequent I/O failures while trying to monitor data from ROOT binary files. There is a workaround for the problem - one could load the file completely and exclude many partial I/O operations by this. To achieve this with JSROO",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md:32491,update,update,32491,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,1,['update'],['update']

Today this is possible, even though not common (at least not documented) for; subversion users and for git-svn users. For example, few Git users try to update; LLD or Clang in the same commit as they change an LLVM API. The multirepo variant does not address this: one would have to commit and push; separately in every individual repository. It would be possible to establish a; protocol whereby users add a special token to their commit messages that causes; the umbrella repo's updater bot to group all of them into a single revision. The monorepo variant handles this natively. Branching/Stashing/Updating for Local Development or Experiments; ----------------------------------------------------------------. Currently; ^^^^^^^^^. SVN does not allow this use case, but developers that are currently using; git-svn can do it. Let's look in practice what it means when dealing with; multiple sub-projects.

Occurrences of class `MyClass`; of `MyLib` will now be referenced as `../mylib/MyClass.html`. ### Search Engine. **`THtml`** can invoke external search engines. The ROOT reference guide; sets `Root.Html.Search` to <http://www.google.com/search?q=%s+site%3A%u>.; Calling **`THtml::SetSearchStemURL()`** will set the same. If this URL stem is; set, `THtml` will create search fields in the index pages. It will; send the words entered in these search fields as %s in the URL; %u will; be replaced by the current document's path, allowing a site- and; directory-specific search. ### ViewCVS. Most code is managed in a version control system like CVS. ViewCVS is a; WWW reader interface to the versioning control system that allows e.g.; tracking a file's changes. **`THtml`** will reference these pages; automatically if the `.rootrc` variable `Root.Html.ViewCVS` is set to; the URL stem of the ViewCVS. installation. Alternatively, one can call; THtml::SetViewCVS(). ### Wiki Pages. In some contexts it might be desirable to let users comment on classes,; e.g. for suggestions of use or alternatives, details of behavior, and; cross references to other relevant classes. A successful example of this; is the PHP.net documentation with its user annotations. **`THtml`** can; include a link to a class's Wiki page by setting the Wiki base URL via; `Root.Html.WikiURL` or **`THtml`**`::SetWikiURL()`. ## Tutorial.

If you're new to the LLVM community, you might also find this presentation helpful:; .. _How to Contribute to LLVM, A 2019 LLVM Developers' Meeting Presentation: https://youtu.be/C5Y977rLqpw. A good way for new contributors to increase their knowledge of the code base is; to review code. It is perfectly acceptable to review code and explicitly; defer to others for approval decisions. Experts Should Review Code; --------------------------. If you are an expert in an area of the compiler affected by a proposed patch,; then you are highly encouraged to review the code. If you are a relevant code; owner, and no other experts are reviewing a patch, you must either help arrange; for an expert to review the patch or review it yourself. Code Reviews, Speed, and Reciprocity; ------------------------------------. Sometimes code reviews will take longer than you might hope, especially for; larger features. Common ways to speed up review times for your patches are:. * Review other people's patches. If you help out, everybody will be more; willing to do the same for you; goodwill is our currency.; * Ping the patch. If it is urgent, provide reasons why it is important to you to; get this patch landed and ping it every couple of days. If it is; not urgent, the common courtesy ping rate is one week. Remember that you're; asking for valuable time from other professional developers.; * Ask for help on IRC. Developers on IRC will be able to either help you; directly, or tell you who might be a good reviewer.; * Split your patch into multiple smaller patches that build on each other. The; smaller your patch is, the higher the probability that somebody will take a quick; look at it. When doing this, it is helpful to add ""[N/M]"" (for 1 <= N <= M) to; the title of each patch in the series, so it is clear that there is an order; and what that order is. Developers should participate in code reviews as both reviewers and; authors.

The corresponding bitcode file should be assembled; using the X.Y build and committed as ``compatibility-X.Y.ll.bc``. * Newer releases can ignore features from older releases, but they cannot; miscompile them. For example, if nsw is ever replaced with something else,; dropping it would be a valid way to upgrade the IR. * Debug metadata is special in that it is currently dropped during upgrades. * Non-debug metadata is defined to be safe to drop, so a valid way to upgrade; it is to drop it. That is not very user friendly and a bit more effort is; expected, but no promises are made. C API Changes; -------------. * Stability Guarantees: The C API is, in general, a ""best effort"" for stability.; This means that we make every attempt to keep the C API stable, but that; stability will be limited by the abstractness of the interface and the; stability of the C++ API that it wraps. In practice, this means that things; like ""create debug info"" or ""create this type of instruction"" are likely to be; less stable than ""take this IR file and JIT it for my current machine"". * Release stability: We won't break the C API on the release branch with patches; that go on that branch, with the exception that we will fix an unintentional; C API break that will keep the release consistent with both the previous and; next release. * Testing: Patches to the C API ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst:32349,upgrade,upgrades,32349,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,1,['upgrade'],['upgrades']

Difference between ``install`` and ``install-distribution``; -----------------------------------------------------------. One subtle but important thing to note is the difference between the ``install``; and ``install-distribution`` targets. The ``install`` target is expected to; install every part of LLVM that your build is configured to generate except the; LLVM testing tools. Alternatively the ``install-distribution`` target, which is; recommended for building distributions, only installs specific parts of LLVM as; specified at configuration time by *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS*.

At a high level, whenever MCJIT generates new machine code, it does so in an; in-memory object file that contains the debug information in DWARF format.; MCJIT then adds this in-memory object file to a global list of dynamically; generated object files and calls a special function; ``__jit_debug_register_code`` that the debugger knows about. When the debugger; attaches to a process, it puts a breakpoint in this function and associates a; special handler with it. Once MCJIT calls the registration function, the; debugger catches the breakpoint signal, loads the new object file from the; inferior's memory and resumes execution. This way it can obtain debug; information for pure in-memory object files. GDB Version; ===========. In order to debug code JIT-ed by LLVM, you need GDB 7.0 or newer, which is; available on most modern distributions of Linux. The version of GDB that; Apple ships with Xcode has been frozen at 6.3 for a while. LLDB Version; ============. Due to a regression in release 6.0, LLDB didn't support JITed code debugging for; a while. The bug was fixed in mainline recently, so that debugging JITed ELF; objects should be possible again from the upcoming release 12.0 on. On macOS the; feature must be enabled explicitly using the ``plugin.jit-loader.gdb.enable``; setting. Debugging MCJIT-ed code; =======================. The emerging MCJIT component of LLVM allows full debugging of JIT-ed code with; GDB. This is due to MCJIT's ability to use the MC emitter to provide full; DWARF debugging information to GDB. Note that lli has to be passed the ``--jit-kind=mcjit`` flag to JIT the code; with MCJIT instead of the newer ORC JIT. Example; -------.

The 1st version is optimized to read a single object. The 2nd version is optimized to read the content of TClonesArrays and vectors of pointers to objects. The 3rd version is used to streamed any collections. TBufferXML and TBufferSQL overload the loops to introduce extra code to help the buffer keep track of which streamer element is being streamed (this functionality is not used by TBufferFile.). A TStreamerInfoActions::TActionSequence is an ordered sequence of configured actions. A configured action has both an action which is a free standing function and a configuration object deriving; from TStreamerInfoActions::TConfiguration. The configuration contains information that is specific to the action; but varies from use to use, including the offset from the beginning of the object that needs to be updated.; Other examples of configuration include the number of bits requested for storing a Double32_t or its factor and minimum. When the sequence is intended for a collection, the sequence has a configuration object deriving; from TStreamerInfoActions::TLoopConfiguration which contains for example the size of the element of; a vector or the pointers to the iterators functions (see below). Each TStreamerInfo has 2 reading sequences, one for object-wise reading (GetReadObjectWiseActions); and one for member-wise reading (GetReadMemberWiseActions) which is used when streaming a TClonesArray; of a vector of pointer to the type of objects described by the TClass.

The behavior of these methods is constrained in the following ways. The term; :arc-term:`high-level semantics` is an intentionally vague term; the intent is; that programmers must implement these methods in a way such that the compiler,; modifying code in ways it deems safe according to these constraints, will not; violate their requirements. For example, if the user puts logging statements; in ``retain``, they should not be surprised if those statements are executed; more or less often depending on optimization settings. These constraints are; not exhaustive of the optimization opportunities: values held in local; variables are subject to additional restrictions, described later in this; document. It is undefined behavior if a computation history featuring a send of; ``retain`` followed by a send of ``release`` to the same object, with no; intervening ``release`` on that object, is not equivalent under the high-level; semantics to a computation history in which these sends are removed. Note that; this implies that these methods may not raise exceptions. It is undefined behavior if a computation history features any use whatsoever; of an object following the completion of a send of ``release`` that is not; preceded by a send of ``retain`` to the same object. The behavior of ``autorelease`` must be equivalent to sending ``release`` when; one of the autorelease pools currently in scope is popped. It may not throw an; exception. When the semantics call for performing one of these operations on a retainable; object pointer, if that pointer is ``null`` then the effect is a no-op.

When a function in RooFit is undefined (Poisson with negative mean, PDF with negative values, etc), RooFit can now pass information about the; ""badness"" of the violation to the minimiser. The minimiser can use this to compute a gradient to find its way out of the undefined region.; This can drastically improve its ability to recover when unstable fit models are used, for example RooPolynomial. For details, see the RooFit tutorial [rf612_recoverFromInvalidParameters.C](https://root.cern/doc/v624/rf612__recoverFromInvalidParameters_8C.html); and [arxiv:2012.02746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02746). ### Modernised RooDataHist. RooDataHist was partially modernised to improve const-correctness, to reduce side effects as well as its memory footprint, and to make; it ready for RooFit's faster batch evaluations.; Derived classes that directly access protected members might need to be updated. This holds especially for direct accesses to `_curWeight`,; `_curWeightErrLo`, etc, which have been removed. (It doesn't make sense to write to these members from const functions when the same information; can be retrieved using an index access operator of an array.) All similar accesses in derived classes should be replaced by the getters `get_curWeight()`; or better `get_wgt(i)`, which were also supported in ROOT \<v6.24. More details on what happened:. - Reduced side effects. This code produces undefined behaviour because the side effect of `get(i)`, i.e., loading the new weight into `_curWeight`; is not guaranteed to happen before `weight()` is called:; ```; processEvent(dataHist.get(i), dataHist.weight()); // Dangerous!

In order; to support mutation, we need to change this slightly, so that; ``NamedValues`` holds the *memory location* of the variable in question.; Note that this change is a refactoring: it changes the structure of the; code, but does not (by itself) change the behavior of the compiler. All; of these changes are isolated in the Kaleidoscope code generator. At this point in Kaleidoscope's development, it only supports variables; for two things: incoming arguments to functions and the induction; variable of 'for' loops. For consistency, we'll allow mutation of these; variables in addition to other user-defined variables. This means that; these will both need memory locations. To start our transformation of Kaleidoscope, we'll change the; ``NamedValues`` map so that it maps to AllocaInst\* instead of Value\*. Once; we do this, the C++ compiler will tell us what parts of the code we need; to update:. .. code-block:: c++. static std::map<std::string, AllocaInst*> NamedValues;. Also, since we will need to create these allocas, we'll use a helper; function that ensures that the allocas are created in the entry block of; the function:. .. code-block:: c++. /// CreateEntryBlockAlloca - Create an alloca instruction in the entry block of; /// the function. This is used for mutable variables etc.; static AllocaInst *CreateEntryBlockAlloca(Function *TheFunction,; const std::string &VarName) {; IRBuilder<> TmpB(&TheFunction->getEntryBlock(),; TheFunction->getEntryBlock().begin());; return TmpB.CreateAlloca(Type::getDoubleTy(*TheContext), nullptr,; VarName);; }. This funny looking code creates an IRBuilder object that is pointing at; the first instruction (.begin()) of the entry block. It then creates an; alloca with the expected name and returns it. Because all values in; Kaleidoscope are doubles, there is no need to pass in a type to use.

Deployability,"c generates no code in place, unless nops are; needed to cover its shadow (see below). However, its offset from; function entry is stored in the stack map. This is the relative; instruction address immediately following the instructions that; precede the stack map. The stack map ID allows a runtime to locate the desired stack map; record. LLVM passes this ID through directly to the stack map; record without checking uniqueness. LLVM guarantees a shadow of instructions following the stack map's; instruction offset during which neither the end of the basic block nor; another call to ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` or; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint`` may occur. This allows the runtime to; patch the code at this point in response to an event triggered from; outside the code. The code for instructions following the stack map; may be emitted in the stack map's shadow, and these instructions may; be overwritten by destructive patching. Without shadow bytes, this; destructive patching could overwrite program text or data outside the; current function. We disallow overlapping stack map shadows so that; the runtime does not need to consider this corner case. For example, a stack map with 8 byte shadow:. .. code-block:: llvm. call void @runtime(); call void (i64, i32, ...) @llvm.experimental.stackmap(i64 77, i32 8,; ptr %ptr); %val = load i64, ptr %ptr; %add = add i64 %val, 3; ret i64 %add. May require one byte of nop-padding:. .. code-block:: none. 0x00 callq _runtime; 0x05 nop <--- stack map address; 0x06 movq (%rdi), %rax; 0x07 addq $3, %rax; 0x0a popq %rdx; 0x0b ret <---- end of 8-byte shadow. Now, if the runtime needs to invalidate the compiled code, it may; patch 8 bytes of code at the stack map's address at follows:. .. code-block:: none. 0x00 callq _runtime; 0x05 movl $0xffff, %rax <--- patched code at stack map address; 0x0a callq *%rax <---- end of 8-byte shadow.

Building Clang with PGO; =======================. If you prefer to not use the script or the cmake cache, this briefly goes over; how to build Clang/LLVM with PGO. First, you should have at least LLVM, Clang, and compiler-rt checked out; locally. Next, at a high level, you're going to need to do the following:. 1. Build a standard Release Clang and the relevant libclang_rt.profile library; 2. Build Clang using the Clang you built above, but with instrumentation; 3. Use the instrumented Clang to generate profiles, which consists of two steps:. - Running the instrumented Clang/LLVM/lld/etc. on tasks that represent how; users will use said tools.; - Using a tool to convert the ""raw"" profiles generated above into a single,; final PGO profile. 4. Build a final release Clang (along with whatever other binaries you need); using the profile collected from your benchmark. In more detailed steps:. 1. Configure a Clang build as you normally would. It's highly recommended that; you use the Release configuration for this, since it will be used to build; another Clang. Because you need Clang and supporting libraries, you'll want; to build the ``all`` target (e.g. ``ninja all`` or ``make -j4 all``). 2. Configure a Clang build as above, but add the following CMake args:. - ``-DLLVM_BUILD_INSTRUMENTED=IR`` -- This causes us to build everything; with instrumentation.; - ``-DLLVM_BUILD_RUNTIME=No`` -- A few projects have bad interactions when; built with profiling, and aren't necessary to build. This flag turns them; off.; - ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang`` - Use the Clang we built in; step 1.; - ``-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/stage1/clang++`` - Same as above. In this build directory, you simply need to build the ``clang`` target (and; whatever supporting tooling your benchmark requires).",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.rst:3543,release,release,3543,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/HowToBuildWithPGO.rst,1,['release'],['release']

Deployability,"c versions of the tools are being used on PowerPC. #. **Translate: Tool Specific Argument Translation**. Once a Tool has been selected to perform a particular Action, the; Tool must construct concrete Commands which will be executed during; compilation. The main work is in translating from the gcc style; command line options to whatever options the subprocess expects. Some tools, such as the assembler, only interact with a handful of; arguments and just determine the path of the executable to call and; pass on their input and output arguments. Others, like the compiler; or the linker, may translate a large number of arguments in addition. The ArgList class provides a number of simple helper methods to; assist with translating arguments; for example, to pass on only the; last of arguments corresponding to some option, or all arguments for; an option. The result of this stage is a list of Commands (executable paths and; argument strings) to execute. #. **Execute**. Finally, the compilation pipeline is executed.

Some downstream users track the order commits were made to subprojects; with some kind of ""umbrella"" project that imports the project git; mirrors as submodules, similar to the multirepo umbrella proposed; above.

The vertical bars represent submodule updates to a particular local; commit in the project mirror. ``UM3`` in this case is a commit of; some local umbrella repository state that is not a submodule update,; perhaps a ``README`` or project build script update. Commit ``UM8``; updates a submodule of local project ``myproj``.

The DWARF lane identifier is pushed by; the ``DW_OP_LLVM_push_lane`` DWARF expression operation. See DWARF Version 5; section 2.5 which is updated by *DWARF Extensions For Heterogeneous Debugging*; section :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-expressions`. For AMDGPU, the lane identifier corresponds to the hardware lane ID of a; wavefront. It is numbered from 0 to the wavefront size minus 1. Operation Expressions; ---------------------. DWARF expressions are used to compute program values and the locations of; program objects. See DWARF Version 5 section 2.5 and; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-expressions`. DWARF location descriptions describe how to access storage which includes memory; and registers. When accessing storage on AMDGPU, bytes are ordered with least; significant bytes first, and bits are ordered within bytes with least; significant bits first. For AMDGPU CFI expressions, ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` is used to describe; unwinding vector registers that are spilled under the execution mask to memory:; the zero-single location description is the vector register, and the one-single; location description is the spilled memory location description.

The optional ``!nontemporal`` metadata must reference a single metadata; name ``<nontemp_node>`` corresponding to a metadata node with one ``i32`` entry; of value 1. The existence of the ``!nontemporal`` metadata on the instruction; tells the optimizer and code generator that this load is not expected to; be reused in the cache.

Deployability,"cantfail:. Using cantFail to simplify safe callsites; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Some functions may only fail for a subset of their inputs, so calls using known; safe inputs can be assumed to succeed. The cantFail functions encapsulate this by wrapping an assertion that their; argument is a success value and, in the case of Expected<T>, unwrapping the; T value:. .. code-block:: c++. Error onlyFailsForSomeXValues(int X);; Expected<int> onlyFailsForSomeXValues2(int X);. void foo() {; cantFail(onlyFailsForSomeXValues(KnownSafeValue));; int Y = cantFail(onlyFailsForSomeXValues2(KnownSafeValue));; ...; }. Like the ExitOnError utility, cantFail simplifies control flow. Their treatment; of error cases is very different however: Where ExitOnError is guaranteed to; terminate the program on an error input, cantFail simply asserts that the result; is success. In debug builds this will result in an assertion failure if an error; is encountered. In release builds the behavior of cantFail for failure values is; undefined. As such, care must be taken in the use of cantFail: clients must be; certain that a cantFail wrapped call really can not fail with the given; arguments. Use of the cantFail functions should be rare in library code, but they are; likely to be of more use in tool and unit-test code where inputs and/or; mocked-up classes or functions may be known to be safe. Fallible constructors; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Some classes require resource acquisition or other complex initialization that; can fail during construction. Unfortunately constructors can't return errors,; and having clients test objects after they're constructed to ensure that they're; valid is error prone as it's all too easy to forget the test.

It's probably a good idea if:. - you've landed 3-5 patches of larger scope than ""fix a typo"". - you'd be willing to review changes that are closely related to yours. - you'd like to keep contributing to LLVM. Getting commit access; ---------------------. LLVM uses Git for committing changes.

Actually, this would be a great time to read the rest of the `developer; policy <https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html>`__, too. At minimum,; you need to be subscribed to the relevant commits list before landing; changes (e.g. llvm-commits@lists.llvm.org), as discussion often happens; there if a new patch causes problems. Post-commit errors; ------------------. Once your change is submitted it will be picked up by automated build; bots that will build and test your patch in a variety of configurations. You can see all configurations and their current state in a waterfall; view at http://lab.llvm.org/buildbot/#/waterfall. The waterfall view is good; to get a general overview over the tested configurations and to see; which configuration have been broken for a while. The console view at http://lab.llvm.org/buildbot/#/console helps to get a; better understanding of the build results of a specific patch. If you; want to follow along how your change is affecting the build bots, **this; should be the first place to look at** - the colored bubbles correspond; to projects in the waterfall. If you see a broken build, do not despair - some build bots are; continuously broken; if your change broke the build, you will see a red; bubble in the console view, while an already broken build will show an; orange bubble.

We have a few tricks up in; the sleeves to but they come with given trade-offs. #### Preloading of C++ Modules. The main focus for the technology preview was not in performance until recently.; We have invested some resources in optimizations and we would like to show you; (probably outdated) performance results:. * Memory footprint -- mostly due to importing all C++ Modules at startup; we see overhead which depends on the number of preloaded modules. For; ROOT it is between 40-60 MB depending on the concrete configuration.; When the workload increases we notice that the overall memory performance; decreases in number of cases.; * Execution times -- likewise we have an execution overhead. For ; workflows which take ms the slowdown can be 2x. Increasing of the work; to seconds shows 50-60% slowdowns. The performance is dependent on many factors such as configuration of ROOT and; workflow. You can read more at our Intel IPCC-ROOT Showcase presentation; here (pp 25-33)[[8]]. #### Loading C++ Modules on Demand. In long term, we should optimize the preloading of modules to be a no-op and; avoid recursive behavior based on identifier lookup callbacks. Unfortunately,; at the moment the loading of C++ modules on demand shows significantly better; performance results. You can visit our continuous performance monitoring tool where we compare; the performance of ROOT against ROOT with a PCH [[9]].; *Note: if you get error 400, clean your cache or open a private browser session.*. ## How to use; C++ Modules in ROOT are default since v6.20 (Unix) and v6.22 (OSX).

With this scaffolding, we can now talk about parsing expressions and; function bodies in Kaleidoscope. Parser Basics; =============. Now that we have an AST to build, we need to define the parser code to; build it. The idea here is that we want to parse something like ""x+y""; (which is returned as three tokens by the lexer) into an AST that could; be generated with calls like this:. .. code-block:: c++. auto LHS = std::make_unique<VariableExprAST>(""x"");; auto RHS = std::make_unique<VariableExprAST>(""y"");; auto Result = std::make_unique<BinaryExprAST>('+', std::move(LHS),; std::move(RHS));. In order to do this, we'll start by defining some basic helper routines:. .. code-block:: c++. /// CurTok/getNextToken - Provide a simple token buffer. CurTok is the current; /// token the parser is looking at. getNextToken reads another token from the; /// lexer and updates CurTok with its results.; static int CurTok;; static int getNextToken() {; return CurTok = gettok();; }. This implements a simple token buffer around the lexer. This allows us; to look one token ahead at what the lexer is returning. Every function; in our parser will assume that CurTok is the current token that needs to; be parsed. .. code-block:: c++. /// LogError* - These are little helper functions for error handling.; std::unique_ptr<ExprAST> LogError(const char *Str) {; fprintf(stderr, ""Error: %s\n"", Str);; return nullptr;; }; std::unique_ptr<PrototypeAST> LogErrorP(const char *Str) {; LogError(Str);; return nullptr;; }. The ``LogError`` routines are simple helper routines that our parser will; use to handle errors. The error recovery in our parser will not be the; best and is not particular user-friendly, but it will be enough for our; tutorial. These routines make it easier to handle errors in routines; that have various return types: they always return null",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst:5974,update,updates,5974,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst,1,['update'],['updates']

The patch point also emits nops to cover at least ``<numBytes>`` of; instruction encoding space. Hence, the client must ensure that; ``<numBytes>`` is enough to encode a call to the target address on the; supported targets.

Deployability,"chedResult()``, but getting direct access to an outer level IR analysis; manager to compute an outer level IR analysis is not allowed. This is for a; couple reasons. The first reason is that running analyses across outer level IR in inner level; IR passes can result in quadratic compile time behavior. For example, a module; analysis often scans every function and allowing function passes to run a module; analysis may cause us to scan functions a quadratic number of times. If passes; could keep outer level analyses up to date rather than computing them on demand; this wouldn't be an issue, but that would be a lot of work to ensure every pass; updates all outer level analyses, and so far this hasn't been necessary and; there isn't infrastructure for this (aside from function analyses in loop passes; as described below). Self-updating analyses that gracefully degrade also handle; this problem (e.g. GlobalsAA), but they run into the issue of having to be; manually recomputed somewhere in the optimization pipeline if we want precision,; and they block potential future concurrency. The second reason is to keep in mind potential future pass concurrency, for; example parallelizing function passes over different functions in a CGSCC or; module. Since passes can ask for a cached analysis result, allowing passes to; trigger outer level analysis computation could result in non-determinism if; concurrency was supported. A related limitation is that outer level IR analyses; that are used must be immutable, or else they could be invalidated by changes to; inner level IR. Outer analyses unused by inner passes can and often will be; invalidated by changes to inner level IR. These invalidations happen after the; inner pass manager finishes, so accessing mutable analyses would give invalid; results. The exception to not being able to access outer level analyses is accessing; function analyses in loop passes. Loop passes often use function analyses such; as the dominator tree.

In the following example code, the x variable is used before it is; defined:. int f0() {; __block int x;; return ^(){ return x; }();; }. By an accident of implementation, GCC and llvm-gcc unintentionally always; zero initialized __block variables. However, any program which depends; on this behavior is relying on unspecified compiler behavior. Programs must; explicitly initialize all local block variables before they are used, as with; other local variables.; Clang does not zero initialize local block variables, and programs which rely; on such behavior will most likely break when built with Clang. Inline assembly. In general, Clang is highly compatible with the GCC inline assembly; extensions, allowing the same set of constraints, modifiers and operands as GCC; inline assembly.; On targets that use the integrated assembler (such as most X86 targets),; inline assembly is run through the integrated assembler instead of your system; assembler (which is most commonly ""gas"", the GNU assembler). The LLVM; integrated assembler is extremely compatible with GAS, but there are a couple of; minor places where it is more picky, particularly due to outright GAS bugs.; One specific example is that the assembler rejects ambiguous X86 instructions; that don't have suffixes. For example:. asm(""add %al, (%rax)"");; asm(""addw $4, (%rax)"");; asm(""add $4, (%rax)"");. Both clang and GAS accept the first instruction: because the first; instruction uses the 8-bit %al register as an operand, it is clear that; it is an 8-bit add. The second instruction is accepted by both because the ""w""; suffix indicates that it is a 16-bit add. The last instruction is accepted by; GAS even though there is nothing that specifies the size of the instruction (and; the assembler randomly picks a 32-bit add). Because it is ambiguous, Clang; rejects the instruction with this error message:. <inline asm>:3:1: err",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/compatibility.html:7464,integrat,integrated,7464,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/compatibility.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/compatibility.html,4,['integrat'],['integrated']

Not draining the pool during an unwind is apparently; required by the Objective-C exceptions implementation. .. _arc.misc.externally_retained:. Externally-Retained Variables; -----------------------------. In some situations, variables with strong ownership are considered; externally-retained by the implementation. This means that the variable is; retained elsewhere, and therefore the implementation can elide retaining and; releasing its value. Such a variable is implicitly ``const`` for safety. In; contrast with ``__unsafe_unretained``, an externally-retained variable still; behaves as a strong variable outside of initialization and destruction. For; instance, when an externally-retained variable is captured in a block the value; of the variable is retained and released on block capture and destruction. It; also affects C++ features such as lambda capture, ``decltype``, and template; argument deduction. Implicitly, the implementation assumes that the :ref:`self parameter in a; non-init method <arc.misc.self>` and the :ref:`variable in a for-in loop; <arc.misc.enumeration>` are externally-retained. Externally-retained semantics can also be opted into with the; ``objc_externally_retained`` attribute.

You can use `TAxis::SetRange` or `TAxis::SetRangeUser` to zoom the axis. ``` {.cpp}; TAxis::SetRange(Int_t binfirst,Int_t binlast); ```. The `SetRange` method parameters are bin numbers. They are not axis. For; example if a histogram plots the values from 0 to 500 and has 100 bins,; `SetRange(0,10)` will cover the values 0 to 50. The parameters for; `SetRangeUser` are user coordinates. If the start or end is in the; middle of a bin the resulting range is approximation. It finds the low; edge bin for the start and the high edge bin for the high. ``` {.cpp}; TAxis::SetRangeUser(Axis_t ufirst,Axis_t ulast); ```. Both methods, `SetRange` and `SetRangeUser`, are in the context menu of; any axis and can be used interactively. In addition, you can zoom an; axis interactively: click on the axis on the start, drag the cursor to; the end, and release the mouse button. ### Drawing Axis Independently of Graphs or Histograms. An axis may be drawn independently of a histogram or a graph. This may; be useful to draw for example a supplementary axis for a graph. In this; case, one has to use the **`TGaxis`** class, the graphical; representation of an axis. One may use the standard constructor for this; kind of objects:. ``` {.cpp}; TGaxis(Double_t xmin, Double_t ymin, Double_t xmax, Double_t ymax,; Double_t wmin, Double_t wmax, Int_t ndiv = 510,; Option_t* chopt,Double_t gridlength = 0); ```. The arguments `xmin, ymin` are the coordinates of the axis' start in the; user coordinates system, `and xmax, ymax` are the end coordinates. The; arguments `wmin` and `wmax` are the minimum (at the start) and maximum; (at the end) values to be represented on the axis; `ndiv` is the number; of divisions.

DESCRIPTION; -----------. :program:`clang` is a C, C++, and Objective-C compiler which encompasses; preprocessing, parsing, optimization, code generation, assembly, and linking.; Depending on which high-level mode setting is passed, Clang will stop before; doing a full link. While Clang is highly integrated, it is important to; understand the stages of compilation, to understand how to invoke it. These; stages are:. Driver; The clang executable is actually a small driver which controls the overall; execution of other tools such as the compiler, assembler and linker.; Typically you do not need to interact with the driver, but you; transparently use it to run the other tools. Preprocessing; This stage handles tokenization of the input source file, macro expansion,; #include expansion and handling of other preprocessor directives. The; output of this stage is typically called a "".i"" (for C), "".ii"" (for C++),; "".mi"" (for Objective-C), or "".mii"" (for Objective-C++) file. Parsing and Semantic Analysis; This stage parses the input file, translating preprocessor tokens into a; parse tree. Once in the form of a parse tree, it applies semantic; analysis to compute types for expressions as well and determine whether; the code is well formed. This stage is responsible for generating most of; the compiler warnings as well as parse errors. The output of this stage is; an ""Abstract Syntax Tree"" (AST). Code Generation and Optimization; This stage translates an AST into low-level intermediate code (known as; ""LLVM IR"") and ultimately to machine code. This phase is responsible for; optimizing the generated code and handling target-specific code generation.; The output of this stage is typically called a "".s"" file or ""assembly"" file.

Lots of bug fixes and improvements to analyzer precision (fewer false positives, possibly more bugs found).; Introductory analysis support for C++ and Objective-C++. This build contains basic support for C++ and Objective-C++ that is ready to be tried out; by general users. It is still in its infancy, but establishes a baseline for things to come. The main hope is that it can find some; issues and have a reasonable false positive rate.; Please file bugs when you see issues of any kind so we can assess; where development on C++ analysis support needs to be focused.; To try out C++ analysis support, it should work out of the box using scan-build. If you are using this checker build; as a replacement to the analyzer bundled with Xcode, first use the set-xcode-analyzer script to change Xcode to use; your version of the analyzer. You will then need to modify one configuration file in Xcode to enable C++ analysis support. This can; be done with the following steps:. Find the clang .xcspec file:; $ cd /Developer/Library; $ find . | grep xcspec | grep Clang; ./Xcode/<SNIP>/Clang LLVM 1.0.xcplugin/Contents/Resources/Clang LLVM 1.0.xcspec. The exact location of the file may vary depending on your installation of Xcode. Edit that file, and look for the string ""--analyze"":.

Deployability,"classification tasks (signal over background discrimination). A vast; majority of commonly used neural networks are multilayer perceptrons.; This implementation of multilayer perceptrons is inspired from the; `MLPfit` package, which remains one of the fastest tools for neural; networks studies. ### The MLP. The multilayer perceptron is a simple feed-forward network with the; following structure showed on the left. ![](pictures/0300008D.png). It is made of neurons characterized by a bias and weighted links in; between - let's call those links synapses. The input neurons receive; the inputs, normalize them and forward them to the first hidden layer.; Each neuron in any subsequent layer first computes a linear; combination of the outputs of the previous layer. The output of the; neuron is then function of that combination with f being linear for; output neurons or a sigmoid for hidden layers. Such a structure is very useful because of two theorems:. 1- A linear combination of `sigmoids` can approximate any continuous; function. 2- Trained with `output=1` for the signal and 0 for the background,; the approximated function of inputs `X` is the probability of signal,; knowing `X`. ### Learning Methods. The aim of all learning methods is to minimize the total error on a; set of weighted examples. The error is defined as the sum in quadrate,; divided by two, of the error on each individual output neuron. In all; methods implemented in this library, one needs to compute the first; derivative of that error with respect to the weights. Exploiting the; well-known properties of the derivative, one can express this; derivative as the product of the local partial derivative by the; weighted sum of the outputs derivatives (for a neuron) or as the; product of the input value with the local partial derivative of the; output neuron (for a synapse). This computation is called; ""back-propagation of the errors"". Six learning methods are; implemented. #### Stochastic Minimization.

The default compression algorithm used when writing ROOT files has been updated to use LZ4 in particular to improve read (decompression) performance. You can change this default for each file through (for example) the `TFile constructor` or `TFile::SetCompressionAlgorithm`. It should be noted that ROOT files written with LZ4 compression can not be read with older release of ROOT. Support for LZ4 was however back-ported to the patch branches of previous releases and the following tags (and later release in the same patch series) can read ROOT files written with LZ4 compression:. * v5.34/38; * v6.08/06 [not yet released]; * v6.10/08; * v6.12/02. ## Removed interfaces. ## Core Libraries; - Optimize away redundant deserialization of template specializations. This reduces the memory footprint for hsimple by around 30% while improving the runtime performance for various cases by around 15%.; - When ROOT is signaled with a SIGUSR2 (i.e. on Linux and MacOS X) it will now print a backtrace.; - Move RStringView.h to ROOT/RStringView.hxx and always include ROOT/RStringView.hxx instead of RStringView.h for backward compatibility; - In `TClingCallFunc`, support r-value reference parameters. This paves the way for the corresponding support in PyROOT (implemented now in the latest Cppyy).; - Included the new TSequentialExecutor in ROOT, sharing the interfaces of TExecutor.This should improve code economy when providing a fallback for TThreadExecutor/TProcessExecutor. ### Th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v614/index.md:1475,patch,patch,1475,README/ReleaseNotes/v614/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v614/index.md,4,"['patch', 'release']","['patch', 'release', 'releases']"

Integration tests are checks; which ensure the synergy between different (unit tested) components.

Deployability,"completion of a send of ``release`` that is not; preceded by a send of ``retain`` to the same object. The behavior of ``autorelease`` must be equivalent to sending ``release`` when; one of the autorelease pools currently in scope is popped. It may not throw an; exception. When the semantics call for performing one of these operations on a retainable; object pointer, if that pointer is ``null`` then the effect is a no-op. All of the semantics described in this document are subject to additional; :ref:`optimization rules <arc.optimization>` which permit the removal or; optimization of operations based on local knowledge of data flow. The; semantics describe the high-level behaviors that the compiler implements, not; an exact sequence of operations that a program will be compiled into. .. _arc.objects.operands:. Retainable object pointers as operands and arguments; ----------------------------------------------------. In general, ARC does not perform retain or release operations when simply using; a retainable object pointer as an operand within an expression. This includes:. * loading a retainable pointer from an object with non-weak :ref:`ownership; <arc.ownership>`,; * passing a retainable pointer as an argument to a function or method, and; * receiving a retainable pointer as the result of a function or method call. .. admonition:: Rationale. While this might seem uncontroversial, it is actually unsafe when multiple; expressions are evaluated in ""parallel"", as with binary operators and calls,; because (for example) one expression might load from an object while another; writes to it. However, C and C++ already call this undefined behavior; because the evaluations are unsequenced, and ARC simply exploits that here to; avoid needing to retain arguments across a large number of calls. The remainder of this section describes exceptions to these rules, how those; exceptions are detected, and what those exceptions imply semantically. .. _arc.objects.operands.consumed:.

FatLTO objects are a special type of `fat object file; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_binary>`_ that contain LTO compatible IR in; addition to generated object code, instead of containing object code for; multiple target architectures. This allows users to defer the choice of whether; to use LTO or not to link-time, and has been a feature available in other; compilers, like `GCC; <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/LTO-Overview.html>`_, for some time. Under FatLTO the compiler can emit standard object files which contain both the; machine code in the ``.text`` section and LLVM bitcode in the ``.llvm.lto``; section. Overview; ========. Within LLVM, FatLTO is supported by choosing the ``FatLTODefaultPipeline``.; This pipeline will:. #) Run the pre-link (Thin)LTO pipeline on the current module.; #) Embed the pre-link bitcode in a special ``.llvm.lto`` section.; #) Finish optimizing the module using the ModuleOptimization pipeline.; #) Emit the object file, including the new ``.llvm.lto`` section. .. NOTE. Previously, we conservatively ran independent pipelines on separate copies; of the LLVM module to generate the bitcode section and the object code,; which happen to be identical to those used outside of FatLTO. While that; resulted in compiled artifacts that were identical to those produced by the; default and (Thin)LTO pipelines, module cloning led to some cases of; miscompilation, and we have moved away from trying to keep bitcode; generation and optimization completely disjoint. Bit-for-bit compatibility is not (and never was) a guarantee, and we reserve; the right to change this at any time. Explicitly, users should not rely on; the produced bitcode or object code to match their non-LTO counterparts; precisely. They will exhibit similar performance characteristics, but may; not be bit-for-bit the same.

Now it is possible to centrally define the global minimizer for all RooFit libraries via `ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions::SetDefaultMinimizer()`, or alternatively in the `.rootrc` file by adding for example `Root.Fitter: Minuit2` to select Minuit2. ### Code modernization by using `std::string` in RooFit interfaces. The following lesser-used RooFit functions now return a `std::string` instead of a `const char*`, potentially requiring the update of your code:. - [std::string RooCmdConfig::missingArgs() const](https://root.cern/doc/v628/classRooCmdConfig.html#aec50335293c45a507d347c604bf9651f); ### Uniquely identifying RooArgSet and RooDataSet objects.

Deployability,"correctness of bounds annotations; ---------------------------------------------. ``-fbounds-safety`` maintains correctness of bounds annotations by performing; additional checks when a pointer object and/or its related value containing the; bounds information is updated. For example, ``__single`` expresses an invariant that the pointer must either; point to a single valid object or be a null pointer. To maintain this invariant,; the compiler inserts checks when initializing a ``__single`` pointer, as shown; in the following example:. .. code-block:: c. void foo(void *__sized_by(size) vp, size_t size) {; // Inserted check:; // if ((int*)upper_bound(vp) - (int*)vp < sizeof(int) && !!vp) trap();; int *__single ip = (int *)vp;; }. Additionally, an explicit bounds annotation such as ``int *__counted_by(count); buf`` defines a relationship between two variables, ``buf`` and ``count``:; namely, that ``buf`` has ``count`` number of elements available. This; relationship must hold even after any of these related variables are updated. To; this end, the model requires that assignments to ``buf`` and ``count`` must be; side by side, with no side effects between them. This prevents ``buf`` and; ``count`` from temporarily falling out of sync due to updates happening at a; distance. The example below shows a function ``alloc_buf`` that initializes a struct that; members that use the ``__counted_by`` annotation. The compiler allows these; assignments because ``sbuf->buf`` and ``sbuf->count`` are updated side by side; without any side effects in between the assignments. Furthermore, the compiler inserts additional run-time checks to ensure the new; ``buf`` has at least as many elements as the new ``count`` indicates as shown in; the transformed pseudo code of function ``alloc_buf()`` in the example below. .. code-block:: c. typedef struct {; int *__counted_by(count) buf;; size_t count;; } sized_buf_t;. void alloc_buf(sized_buf_t *sbuf, sized_t nelems) {; sbuf->buf = (int *)malloc(",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:36151,update,updated,36151,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['update'],['updated']

The vertical bars represent submodule updates to a particular local; commit in the project mirror. ``UM3`` in this case is a commit of; some local umbrella repository state that is not a submodule update,; perhaps a ``README`` or project build script update.

This corresponds to the C/C++; ``memory_order_release``.; ``acq_rel`` (acquire+release); Acts as both an ``acquire`` and ``release`` operation on its; address. This corresponds to the C/C++ ``memory_order_acq_rel``.; ``seq_cst`` (sequentially consistent); In addition to the guarantees of ``acq_rel`` (``acquire`` for an; operation that only reads, ``release`` for an operation that only; writes), there is a global total order on all; sequentially-consistent operations on all addresses. Each; sequentially-consistent read sees the last preceding write to the; same address in this global order. This corresponds to the C/C++; ``memory_order_seq_cst`` and Java ``volatile``. Note: this global total order is *not* guaranteed to be fully; consistent with the *happens-before* partial order if; non-``seq_cst`` accesses are involved. See the C++ standard; `[atomics.order] <https://wg21.link/atomics.order>`_ section; for more details on the exact guarantees. .. _syncscope:. If an atomic operation is marked ``syncscope(""singlethread"")``, it only; *synchronizes with* and only participates in the seq\_cst total orderings of; other operations running in the same thread (for example, in signal handlers).

Deployability,"courage you; to use a recent version of a distribution with a modern system compiler that; meets these requirements. Note that it is tempting to install a prior; version of Clang and libc++ to be the host compiler, however libc++ was not; well tested or set up to build on Linux until relatively recently. As; a consequence, this guide suggests just using libstdc++ and a modern GCC as the; initial host in a bootstrap, and then using Clang (and potentially libc++). The first step is to get a recent GCC toolchain installed. The most common; distribution on which users have struggled with the version requirements is; Ubuntu Precise, 12.04 LTS. For this distribution, one easy option is to install; the `toolchain testing PPA`_ and use it to install a modern GCC. There is; a really nice discussions of this on the `ask ubuntu stack exchange`_ and a; `github gist`_ with updated commands. However, not all users can use PPAs and; there are many other distributions, so it may be necessary (or just useful, if; you're here you *are* doing compiler development after all) to build and install; GCC from source.

The important flags to get right are:. * On the pre-release, you should change ``-rc 1`` to ``-final``.

Besides creating the `translate()` function, the; `buildCallToAnalyticIntegral()` function also needs to be added when; `analyticalIntegral()` is found in your class. Depending on the code, you can; call one or more integral functions using the `code` parameter. Our RooFoo; example above only contains one integral function (`integralFoo()`). Similar to `doFoo()`, comment out `integralFoo()' in the original file and; move it to 'MathFuncs.h'. As with `doFoo()`. add the relevant inputs (a,b) as parameters, instead of; just class members. ``` {.cpp}; ///// The MathFuncs.h file; int integralFoo(int a, int b) { return /* whatever */;}; ```. > Directory path: [hist/hist/src/MathFuncs.h](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/hist/hist/src/MathFuncs.h). Next, in the original RooFoo class, update all references to the; `integralFoo()` function with its new fully qualified path (; `EvaluateFunc::integralFoo`) and include the input parameters as well (; `EvaluateFunc::integralFoo(a, b)`). ``` {.cpp}; double analyticalIntegral(Int_t code, const char* rangeName) override {; // Select the right paths for integration using codes or whatever.; return EvaluateFunc::integralFoo(a, b);; }; ```. Next, in the `RooAbsReal::buildCallToAnalyticIntegral()` function, simply; return the output using the `buildCall()` function. ``` {.cpp}; std::string; buildCallToAnalyticIntegral(Int_t code, const char *rangeName, RooFit::Detail::RooFit::Detail::CodeSquashContext &ctx) const override {; return ctx.buildCall(""EvaluateFunc::integralFoo"", a, b);; }; ```. \note The implementation of the `RooAbsReal::buildCallToAnalyticIntegral()`; function is quite similar to the `translate()` function, except that in; `translate()`, you have to add to the result (using `addResult()`), while for; `buildCallToAnalyticIntegral()`, you only have to return the string (using; `buildCall()`). **C",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md:23263,update,update,23263,roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md,1,['update'],['update']

For function-local; jump tables, this is easily arranged by testing the input to the jump table; within each destination (not yet implemented, use retpolines):; ```; pushq %rax; xorl %eax, %eax # Zero out initial predicate state.; movq $-1, %r8 # Put all-ones mask into a register.; jmpq *.LJTI0_0(,%rdi,8) # Indirect jump through table.; .LBB0_2: # %sw.bb; testq $0, %rdi # Validate index used for jump table.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; jmp _Z4leaki # TAILCALL. .LBB0_3: # %sw.bb1; testq $1, %rdi # Validate index used for jump table.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; jmp _Z4leaki # TAILCALL. .LBB0_5: # %sw.bb10; testq $2, %rdi # Validate index used for jump table.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; jmp _Z4leaki # TAILCALL; ... .section .rodata,""a"",@progbits; .p2align 3; .LJTI0_0:; .quad .LBB0_2; .quad .LBB0_3; .quad .LBB0_5; ...; ```.

How to build it; ===============. You need to have gold with plugin support and build the LLVMgold plugin.; The gold linker is installed as ld.gold. To see whether gold is the default; on your system, run ``/usr/bin/ld -v``. It will report ""GNU; gold"" or else ""GNU ld"" if not. If gold is already installed at; ``/usr/bin/ld.gold``, one option is to simply make that the default by; backing up your existing ``/usr/bin/ld`` and creating a symbolic link; with ``ln -s /usr/bin/ld.gold /usr/bin/ld``. Alternatively, you can build; with clang's ``-fuse-ld=gold`` or add ``-fuse-ld=gold`` to LDFLAGS, which will; cause the clang driver to invoke ``/usr/bin/ld.gold`` directly. If you have gold installed, check for plugin support by running; ``/usr/bin/ld.gold -plugin``. If it complains ""missing argument"" then; you have plugin support. If not, and you get an error such as ""unknown option"",; then you will either need to build gold or install a version with plugin; support. * Download, configure and build gold with plugin support:. .. code-block:: bash. $ git clone --depth 1 git://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git binutils; $ mkdir build; $ cd build; $ ../binutils/configure --enable-gold --enable-plugins --disable-werror; $ make all-gold. That should leave you with ``build/gold/ld-new`` which supports; the ``-plugin`` option. Running ``make`` will additionally build; ``build/binutils/ar`` and ``nm-new`` binaries supporting plugins. Once you're ready to switch to using gold, backup your existing; ``/usr/bin/ld`` then replace it with ``ld-new``.

Note that the task of identifying all live pointers to garbage; collected values, transforming the IR to expose a pointer giving the; base object for every such live pointer, and inserting all the; intrinsics correctly is explicitly out of scope for this document.; The recommended approach is to use the :ref:`utility passes; <statepoint-utilities>` described below. This abstract function call is concretely represented by a sequence of; intrinsic calls known collectively as a ""statepoint relocation sequence"". Let's consider a simple call in LLVM IR:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8 addrspace(1)* @test1(i8 addrspace(1)* %obj); gc ""statepoint-example"" {; call void ()* @foo(); ret i8 addrspace(1)* %obj; }. Depending on our language we may need to allow a safepoint during the execution; of ``foo``. If so, we need to let the collector update local values in the; current frame. If we don't, we'll be accessing a potential invalid reference; once we eventually return from the call. In this example, we need to relocate the SSA value ``%obj``. Since we can't; actually change the value in the SSA value ``%obj``, we need to introduce a new; SSA value ``%obj.relocated`` which represents the potentially changed value of; ``%obj`` after the safepoint and update any following uses appropriately. The; resulting relocation sequence is:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i8 addrspace(1)* @test1(i8 addrspace(1)* %obj); gc ""statepoint-example"" {; %0 = call token (i64, i32, void ()*, i32, i32, ...)* @llvm.experimental.gc.statepoint.p0f_isVoidf(i64 0, i32 0, void ()* @foo, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i8 addrspace(1)* %obj); %obj.relocated = call coldcc i8 addrspace(1)* @llvm.experimental.gc.relocate.p1i8(token %0, i32 7, i32 7); ret i8 addrspace(1)* %obj.relocated; }.

To access the set of global observables stored in a `RooAbsData`, call `RooAbsData::getGlobalObservables()`.; It returns a `nullptr` if no global observable snapshots are stored in the dataset. For more information of global observables and how to attach them to the toy datasets, please take a look at the new; [rf613_global_observables.C](https://root.cern/doc/v626/rf613__global_observables_8C.html) / [.py](https://root.cern/doc/v626/rf613__global_observables_8py.html) tutorial. ### Changes in `RooAbsPdf::fitTo` behaviour for multi-range fits. The `RooAbsPdf::fitTo` and `RooAbsPdf::createNLL` functions accept a command argument to specify the fit range.; One can also fit in multiple ranges simultaneously.; The definition of such multi-range likelihoods for non-extended fits changes in this release.; Previously, the individual likelihoods were normalized separately in each range, which meant that the relative number of events in each sub-range was not used to estimate the PDF parameters.; From now on, the likelihoods are normalized by the sum of integrals in each range. This implies that the likelihood takes into account all inter-range and intra-range information. ### Deprecation of the `RooMinuit` class. The `RooMinuit` class was the old interface between RooFit and minuit. With ROOT version 5.24, the more general `RooMinimizer` adapter was introduced, which became the default with ROOT 6.08. Before 6.26, it was possible to still use the `RooMinuit` by passing the `Minimizer(""OldMinuit"", ""minimizer"")` command argument to `RooAbsPdf::fitTo()`.

Deployability,"cts programs against return address overwrites; (e.g. stack buffer overflows.) It works by saving a function's return address; to a separately allocated 'shadow call stack' in the function prolog in; non-leaf functions and loading the return address from the shadow call stack; in the function epilog. The return address is also stored on the regular stack; for compatibility with unwinders, but is otherwise unused. The aarch64 implementation is considered production ready, and; an `implementation of the runtime`_ has been added to Android's libc; (bionic). An x86_64 implementation was evaluated using Chromium and was found; to have critical performance and security deficiencies--it was removed in; LLVM 9.0. Details on the x86_64 implementation can be found in the; `Clang 7.0.1 documentation`_. .. _`implementation of the runtime`: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/808d176e7e0dd727c7f929622ec017f6e065c582/libc/bionic/pthread_create.cpp#128; .. _`Clang 7.0.1 documentation`: https://releases.llvm.org/7.0.1/tools/clang/docs/ShadowCallStack.html. Comparison; ----------. To optimize for memory consumption and cache locality, the shadow call; stack stores only an array of return addresses. This is in contrast to other; schemes, like :doc:`SafeStack`, that mirror the entire stack and trade-off; consuming more memory for shorter function prologs and epilogs with fewer; memory accesses. `Return Flow Guard`_ is a pure software implementation of shadow call stacks; on x86_64. Like the previous implementation of ShadowCallStack on x86_64, it is; inherently racy due to the architecture's use of the stack for calls and; returns. Intel `Control-flow Enforcement Technology`_ (CET) is a proposed hardware; extension that would add native support to use a shadow stack to store/check; return addresses at call/return time.

Redirecting the; output of scan-build to a text file (make sure to redirect standard; error) is useful for filing bug reports against scan-build or the; analyzer, as we can see the exact options (and files) passed to the analyzer.; For more comprehensible logs, don't perform a parallel build.; Run './configure' through scan-build; If an analyzed project uses an autoconf generated configure script,; you will probably need to run configure script through; scan",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/scan-build.html:6162,configurat,configuration,6162,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/scan-build.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/www/analyzer/scan-build.html,2,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"d are; subject to the assign, retain, and copy attribute logic that is; reserved for objects. All Blocks are constructed to be Objective-C objects regardless of; whether the Objective-C runtime is operational in the program or; not. Blocks using automatic (stack) memory are objects and may be; messaged, although they may not be assigned into ``__weak`` locations; if garbage collection is enabled. Within a Block literal expression within a method definition; references to instance variables are also imported into the lexical; scope of the compound statement. These variables are implicitly; qualified as references from self, and so self is imported as a const; copy. The net effect is that instance variables can be mutated. The :block-term:`Block_copy` operator retains all objects held in; variables of automatic storage referenced within the Block expression; (or form strong references if running under garbage collection).; Object variables of ``__block`` storage type are assumed to hold; normal pointers with no provision for retain and release messages. Foundation defines (and supplies) ``-copy`` and ``-release`` methods for; Blocks. In the Objective-C and Objective-C++ languages, we allow the; ``__weak`` specifier for ``__block`` variables of object type. If; garbage collection is not enabled, this qualifier causes these; variables to be kept without retain messages being sent. This; knowingly leads to dangling pointers if the Block (or a copy) outlives; the lifetime of this object. In garbage collected environments, the ``__weak`` variable is set to; nil when the object it references is collected, as long as the; ``__block`` variable resides in the heap (either by default or via; ``Block_copy()``). The initial Apple implementation does in fact; start ``__block`` variables on the stack and migrate them to the heap; only as a result of a ``Block_copy()`` operation.

The intent of the second rule is to say that objects held in normal; ``__strong`` local variables may be released as soon as the value in; the variable is no longer being used: either the variable stops; being used completely or a new value is stored in the variable.

This section mostly applies to Linux and older BSDs. On macOS, you should; have a sufficiently modern Xcode, or you will likely need to upgrade until you; do. Windows does not have a ""system compiler"", so you must install either Visual; Studio 2019 (or later), or a recent version of mingw64. FreeBSD 10.0 and newer; have a modern Clang as the system compiler. However, some Linux distributions and some other or older BSDs sometimes have; extremely old versions of GCC. These steps attempt to help you upgrade you; compiler even on such a system. However, if at all possible, we encourage you; to use a recent version of a distribution with a modern system compiler that; meets these requirements. Note that it is tempting to install a prior; version of Clang and libc++ to be the host compiler, however libc++ was not; well tested or set up to build on Linux until relatively recently. As; a consequence, this guide suggests just using libstdc++ and a modern GCC as the; initial host in a bootstrap, and then using Clang (and potentially libc++). The first step is to get a recent GCC toolchain installed. The most common; distribution on which users have struggled with the version requirements is; Ubuntu Precise, 12.04 LTS. For this distribution, one easy option is to install; the `toolchain testing PPA`_ and use it to install a modern GCC.

Check :doc:`HowToCrossCompileLLVM` and `Clang docs on how to cross-compile in general; <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/CrossCompilation.html>`_ for more information; about cross-compiling. The Location of LLVM Object Files; ---------------------------------. The LLVM build system is capable of sharing a single LLVM source tree among; several LLVM builds. Hence, it is possible to build LLVM for several different; platforms or configurations using the same source tree. * Change directory to where the LLVM object files should live:. .. code-block:: console. % cd OBJ_ROOT. * Run ``cmake``:. .. code-block:: console. % cmake -G ""Unix Makefiles"" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release SRC_ROOT. The LLVM build will create a structure underneath *OBJ_ROOT* that matches the; LLVM source tree. At each level where source files are present in the source; tree there will be a corresponding ``CMakeFiles`` directory in the *OBJ_ROOT*.; Underneath that directory there is another directory with a name ending in; ``.dir`` under which you'll find object files for each source. For example:. .. code-block:: console. % cd llvm_build_dir; % find lib/Support/ -name APFloat*; lib/Support/CMakeFiles/LLVMSupport.dir/APFloat.cpp.o.

For example if the user specifies ``-fno-exceptions`` then a; toolchain could select libraries built without exception support, thereby; reducing the size of the resulting binary. Design; ======. Clang supports GCC's ``-print-multi-lib`` and ``-print-multi-directory``; options. These are described in; `GCC Developer Options <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-12.2.0/gcc/Developer-Options.html>`_. There are two ways to configure multilib in Clang: hard-coded or via a; configuration file. Hard-coded Multilib; ===================. The available libraries can be hard-coded in Clang. Typically this is done; using the ``MultilibBuilder`` interface in; ``clang/include/clang/Driver/MultilibBuilder.h``.; There are many examples of this in ``lib/Driver/ToolChains/Gnu.cpp``.; The remainder of this document will not focus on this type of multilib. EXPERIMENTAL Multilib via configuration file; ============================================. Some Clang toolchains support loading multilib configuration from a; ``multilib.yaml`` configuration file. A ``multilib.yaml`` configuration file specifies which multilib variants are; available, their relative location, what compilation options were used to build; them, and the criteria by which they are selected. Multilib processing; ===================. Clang goes through the following steps to use multilib from a configuration; file:. #. Normalize command line options. Clang can accept the same; information via different options - for example,; ``--target=arm-none-eabi -march=armv7-m`` and; ``--target=armv7m-none-eabi`` are equivalent.; Clang normalizes the command line before passing them to the multilib system.; To see what flags are emitted for a given set of command line options, use; the ``-print-multi-flags-experimental`` command line option; along with the rest of the options you want to use.; #. Load ``multilib.yaml`` from sysroot.; #.

ARC applies to Objective-C pointer types, block pointer types, and; :when-revised:`[beginning Apple 8.0, LLVM 3.8]` :revision:`BPTRs declared; within` ``extern ""BCPL""`` blocks. For now, it is sensible to version this document by the releases of its sole; implementation (and its host project), clang. ""LLVM X.Y"" refers to an; open-source release of clang from the LLVM project. ""Apple X.Y"" refers to an; Apple-provided release of the Apple LLVM Compiler. Other organizations that; prepare their own, separately-versioned clang releases and wish to maintain; similar information in this document should send requests to cfe-dev.

How to build it; ===============. You need to have gold with plugin support and build the LLVMgold plugin.; The gold linker is installed as ld.gold. To see whether gold is the default; on your system, run ``/usr/bin/ld -v``. It will report ""GNU; gold"" or else ""GNU ld"" if not.

Alternatively, you can build; with clang's ``-fuse-ld=gold`` or add ``-fuse-ld=gold`` to LDFLAGS, which will; cause the clang driver to invoke ``/usr/bin/ld.gold`` directly. If you have gold installed, check for plugin support by running; ``/usr/bin/ld.gold -plugin``. If it complains ""missing argument"" then; you have plugin support.

The primary goal of experimental support is to assist in the process of ratification by providing an existence proof of an implementation, and simplifying efforts to validate the value of a proposed extension against large code bases. Experimental extensions are expected to either transition to ratified status, or be eventually removed. The decision on whether to accept an experimental extension is currently done on an entirely case by case basis; if you want to propose one, attending the bi-weekly RISC-V sync-up call is strongly advised. ``experimental-zacas``; LLVM implements the `1.0-rc1 draft specification <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-zacas/releases/tag/v1.0-rc1>`_. ``experimental-zfbfmin``, ``experimental-zvfbfmin``, ``experimental-zvfbfwma``; LLVM implements assembler support for the `1.0.0-rc2 specification <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-bfloat16/releases/tag/v59042fc71c31a9bcb2f1957621c960ed36fac401>`_. ``experimental-zicfilp``, ``experimental-zicfiss``; LLVM implements the `0.4 draft specification <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-cfi/releases/tag/v0.4.0>`__. ``experimental-ztso``; LLVM implements the `v0.1 proposed specification <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/draft-20220723-10eea63/riscv-spec.pdf>`__ (see Chapter 25).

Deployability,"d* pad1_1 = (TPad*)(pad1->GetPrimitive(""pad1_1"")); ```. One question remains. In case one does an automatic divide, how one can; set the default margins between pads? This is done by adding two; parameters to `Divide()`, which are the margins in `x` and `y`:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] pad1->Divide(3,2,0.1,0.1); ```. The margins are here set to 10% of the parent pad width. ### Updating the Pad. For performance reasons, a pad is not updated with every change. For; example, changing the coordinates of the pad does not automatically; redraw it. Instead, the pad has a ""bit-modified"" that triggers a redraw.; This bit is automatically set by:. - Touching the pad with the mouse - for example resizing it with the; mouse. - Finishing the execution of a script. - Adding a new primitive or modifying some primitives for example the; name and title of an object. - You can also set the ""bit-modified"" explicitly with the `Modified`; method:. ``` {.cpp}; // the pad has changed; root[] pad1->Modified(); // recursively update all modified pads:; root[] c1->Update(); ```. A subsequent call to `TCanvas::Update()` scans the list of sub-pads; and repaints the pads declared modified. In compiled code or in a long macro, you may want to access an object; created during the paint process. To do so, you can force the painting; with a `TCanvas::Update()`. For example, a **`TGraph`** creates a; histogram (**`TH1`**) to paint itself. In this case the internal; histogram obtained with `TGraph::GetHistogram()` is created only after; the pad is painted. The pad is painted automatically after the script is; finished executing or if you force the painting with `TPad::Modified()`; followed by a `TCanvas::Update()`. Note that it is not necessary to call; `TPad::Modified()` after a call to `Draw()`. The ""bit-modified"" is set; automatically by `Draw()`. A note about the ""bit-modified"" in sub pads:; when you want to update a sub pad in your canvas, you need to call; `pad->Modified()` rather than `canvas->Modifie",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md:26803,update,update,26803,documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,1,['update'],['update']

An example of similar traversals can be found in the DeadStoreElimination pass. Invalidation and updating; -------------------------. Because ``MemorySSA`` keeps track of LLVM IR, it needs to be updated whenever; the IR is updated. ""Update"", in this case, includes the addition, deletion, and; motion of ``Instructions``. The update API is being made on an as-needed basis.; If you'd like examples, ``GVNHoist`` and ``LICM`` are users of ``MemorySSA``\ s; update API.; Note that adding new ``MemoryDef``\ s (by calling ``insertDef``) can be a; time-consuming update, if the new access triggers many ``MemoryPhi`` insertions and; renaming (optimization invalidation) of many ``MemoryAccesses``\ es. Phi placement; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``MemorySSA`` only places ``MemoryPhi``\ s where they're actually; needed. That is, it is a pruned SSA form, like LLVM's SSA form. For; example, consider:. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @foo() {; entry:; %p1 = alloca i8; %p2 = alloca i8; %p3 = alloca i8; ; 1 = MemoryDef(liveOnEntry); store i8 0, ptr %p3; br label %while.cond. while.cond:; ; 3 = MemoryPhi({%0,1},{if.end,2}); br i1 undef, label %if.then, label %if.else. if.then:; br label %if.end. if.else:; br label %if.end. if.end:; ; MemoryUse(1); %1 = load i8, ptr %p1; ; 2 = MemoryDef(3); store i8 2, ptr %p2; ; MemoryUse(1); %2 = load i8, ptr %p3; br label ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst:14300,update,update,14300,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/MemorySSA.rst,1,['update'],['update']
Deployability,"d-alone Builds; ------------------. Stand-alone builds allow you to build a sub-project against a pre-built; version of the clang or llvm libraries that is already present on your; system. You can use the source code from a standard checkout of the llvm-project; (as described above) to do stand-alone builds, but you may also build; from a :ref:`sparse checkout<workflow-multicheckout-nocommit>` or from the; tarballs available on the `releases <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/>`_; page. For stand-alone builds, you must have an llvm install that is configured; properly to be consumable by stand-alone builds of the other projects.; This could be a distro provided LLVM install, or you can build it yourself,; like this:. .. code-block:: console. cmake -G Ninja -S path/to/llvm-project/llvm -B $builddir \; -DLLVM_INSTALL_UTILS=ON \; -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/llvm/install/prefix \; < other options >. ninja -C $builddir install. Once llvm is installed, to configure a project for a stand-alone build, invoke CMake like this:. .. code-block:: console. cmake -G Ninja -S path/to/llvm-project/$subproj \; -B $buildir_subproj \; -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT=/path/to/lit \; -DLLVM_ROOT=/path/to/llvm/install/prefix. Notice that:. * The stand-alone build needs to happen in a folder that is not the; original folder where LLVMN was built; (`$builddir!=$builddir_subproj`).; * ``LLVM_ROOT`` should point to the prefix of your llvm installation,; so for example, if llvm is installed into ``/usr/bin`` and; ``/usr/lib64``, then you should pass ``-DLLVM_ROOT=/usr/``.; * Both the ``LLVM_ROOT`` and ``LLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT`` options are; required to do stand-alone builds for all sub-projects.

Most significantly, it enables the use of concurrency on the prompt!. ## I/O Libraries. - Introduce TKey::ReadObject<typeName>. This is a user friendly wrapper around ReadObjectAny. For example; ```; auto h1 = key->ReadObject<TH1>; ```; after which h1 will either be null if the key contains something that is not a TH1 (or derived class); or will be set to the address of the histogram read from the file.; - Add the ability to store the 'same' object several time (assumingly with different data) in a single buffer. Instead of. ```; while(...) {; TObjArray arr;; ... update the content of ""arr""; buffer << arr;; }; ```; which would only really stream the array at the first iteration because it will be detected has having the same address and thus assumed to be the same object. We can now do:; ```; while(...) {; TObjArray arr;; ... update the content of ""arr""; buffer.WriteObject(&arr, kFALSE);; }; ```; where the last argument of WriteObject tells the buffer do *not* remember this object's address and to always stream it. This feature is also available via WriteObjectAny. - Added a new mechanism for providing clean forward-compatibility breaks in a ``TTree`` (i.e., a newer version of ROOT writes a ``TTree`` an older version cannot read). When future versions of ROOT utilize an IO feature that this version does not support, ROOT will provide a clear error message instead of crashing or returning garbage data. In future ROOT6 releases, forward-compatibility breaks will only be allowed if a non-default feature is enabled via the ``ROOT::Experimental`` namespace; it is expected ROOT7 will enable forward-compatibility breaks by default. - When a file using an unsupported file format feature is encountered, the error message will be similar to the following:; ```; Error in <TBasket::Streamer>: The value of fIOBits (0000000000000000000000",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v612/index.md:7129,update,update,7129,README/ReleaseNotes/v612/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v612/index.md,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"ddition to running them. Clang frontend; --------------. The Clang frontend (``clang -cc1``) is used to compile C family languages. The; command-line interface of the frontend is considered to be an implementation; detail, intentionally has no external documentation, and is subject to change; without notice. Language frontends for other languages; --------------------------------------. Clang can be provided with inputs written in non-C-family languages. In such; cases, an external tool will be used to compile the input. The; currently-supported languages are:. * Ada (``-x ada``, ``.ad[bs]``); * Fortran (``-x f95``, ``.f``, ``.f9[05]``, ``.for``, ``.fpp``, case-insensitive); * Java (``-x java``). In each case, GCC will be invoked to compile the input. Assembler; ---------. Clang can either use LLVM's integrated assembler or an external system-specific; tool (for instance, the GNU Assembler on GNU OSes) to produce machine code from; assembly.; By default, Clang uses LLVM's integrated assembler on all targets where it is; supported. If you wish to use the system assembler instead, use the; ``-fno-integrated-as`` option. Linker; ------. Clang can be configured to use one of several different linkers:. * GNU ld; * GNU gold; * LLVM's `lld <https://lld.llvm.org>`_; * MSVC's link.exe. Link-time optimization is natively supported by lld, and supported via; a `linker plugin <https://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html>`_ when using gold. The default linker varies between targets, and can be overridden via the; ``-fuse-ld=<linker name>`` flag. Runtime libraries; =================. A number of different runtime libraries are required to provide different; layers of support for C family programs. Clang will implicitly link an; appropriate implementation of each runtime library, selected based on; target defaults or explicitly selected by the ``--rtlib=`` and ``--stdlib=``; flags. The set of implicitly-linked libraries depend on the language mode.

For some bots, the ownership responsibility is split between a ""resource owner""; who provides the underlying machine resource, and a ""configuration owner"" who; maintains the build configuration. Generally, operational responsibility lies; with the ""config owner"". We do expect ""resource owners"" - who are generally; the contact listed in a workers attributes - to proxy requests to the relevant; ""config owner"" in a timely manner.

Check the existing build configurations to make sure the one you are; interested in is not covered yet or gets built on your computer much; faster than on the existing one. We prefer faster builds so developers; will get feedback sooner after changes get committed. #. The computer you will be registering with the LLVM buildbot; infrastructure should have all dependencies installed and be able to; build your configuration successfully. Please check what degree; of parallelism (-j param) would give the fastest build. You can build; multiple configurations on one computer. #. Install buildbot-worker (currently we are using buildbot version 2.8.4).; This specific version can be installed using ``pip``, with a command such; as ``pip3 install buildbot-worker==2.8.4``. #. Create a designated user account, your buildbot-worker will be running under,; and set appropriate permissions. #. Choose the buildbot-worker root directory (all builds will be placed under; it), buildbot-worker access name and password the build master will be using; to authenticate your buildbot-worker. #.

This file is available in two different locations. * ``<LLVM_INSTALL_PACKAGE_DIR>/LLVMConfig.cmake`` where; ``<LLVM_INSTALL_PACKAGE_DIR>`` is the location where LLVM CMake modules are; installed as part of an installed version of LLVM. This is typically; ``cmake/llvm/`` within the lib directory. On Linux, this is typically; ``/usr/lib/cmake/llvm/LLVMConfig.cmake``. * ``<LLVM_BUILD_ROOT>/lib/cmake/llvm/LLVMConfig.cmake`` where; ``<LLVM_BUILD_ROOT>`` is the root of the LLVM build tree. **Note: this is only; available when building LLVM with CMake.**.

The ``AttributeList`` stores a collection of Attribute objects for each kind of; object that may have an attribute associated with it: the function as a whole,; the return type, or the function's parameters. A function's attributes are at; index ``AttributeList::FunctionIndex``; the return type's attributes are at; index ``AttributeList::ReturnIndex``; and the function's parameters' attributes; are at indices 1, ..., n (where 'n' is the number of parameters). Most methods; on the ``AttributeList`` class take an index parameter. An ``AttributeList`` is also a uniqued and immutable object. You create an; ``AttributeList`` through the ``AttributeList::get`` methods. You can add and; remove attributes, which result in the creation of a new ``AttributeList``. An ``AttributeList`` object is designed to be passed around by value. Note: It is advised that you do *not* use the ``AttributeList`` ""introspection""; methods (e.g. ``Raw``, ``getRawPointer``, etc.). These methods break; encapsulation, and may be removed in a future release. ``AttrBuilder``; ===============. Lastly, we have a ""builder"" class to help create the ``AttributeList`` object; without having to create several different intermediate uniqued; ``AttributeList`` objects. The ``AttrBuilder`` class allows you to add and; remove attributes at will. The attributes won't be uniqued until you call the; appropriate ``AttributeList::get`` method. An ``AttrBuilder`` object is *not* designed to be passed around by value. It; should be passed by reference. Note: It is advised that you do *not* use the ``AttrBuilder::addRawValue()``; method or the ``AttrBuilder(uint64_t Val)`` constructor. These are for; backwards compatibility and may be removed in a future release. And that's basically it!

In addition to analysis queries, you must make sure to unconditionally pass LLVM; `update notification`_ methods to the superclass as well if you override them,; which allows all alias analyses in a change to be updated. .. _update notification:. Updating analysis results for transformations; ---------------------------------------------. Alias analysis information is initially computed for a static snapshot of the; program, but clients will use this information to make transformations to the; code. All but the most trivial forms of alias analysis will need to have their; analysis results updated to reflect the changes made by these transformations. The ``AliasAnalysis`` interface exposes four methods which are used to; communicate program changes from the clients to the analysis implementations.; Various alias analysis implementations should use these methods to ensure that; their internal data structures are kept up-to-date as the program changes (for; example, when an instruction is deleted), and clients of alias analysis must be; sure to call these interfaces appropriately. The ``deleteValue`` method; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``deleteValue`` method is called by transformations when they remove an; instruction or any other value from the program (including values that do not; use pointers).

Technically it is a Bash shell script which provides shortcuts for PROOF; on Demand commands and ensures local and remote environment consistency:; by executing it you enter a new clean environment where all your; software dependencies have already been set up. Local and remote environment configuration is split into a series of; files, which give the possibility to:. - have a system-wide, sysadmin-provided experiment configuration. - execute user actions either *before* or *after* the execution of the; system-wide script (for instance, choosing the preferred version of; the experiment's software). - transfer a custom user **payload** on each PROOF worker (for instance,; user's client-generated Grid credentials to make PROOF workers; capable of accessing a remote authenticated storage). Configuration files are searched for in two different locations:. - a system-wide directory: `<client_install_dir>/etc`. - user's home directory: `~/.vaf`. > A system-wide configuration file always has precedence over user's; > configuration. It is thus possible for the sysadmin to enforce a; > policy where some scripts cannot ever be overridden. Thanks to this separation, users can maintain an uncluttered directory; with very simple configuration files that contain only what really needs; or is allowed to be customized: for instance, user might specify a single line; containing the needed ROOT version, while all the technicalities to set; up the environment are taken care of inside system-installed scripts,; leaving the user's configuration directory clean and uncluttered. ### Local environment configuration.

Deployability,"del ``begin()``; as a function that returns this symbol. The array pointed to by that symbol; would be ``bindLoc()``ed to contain the list's contents (probably as a ``CompoundVal``; to produce less bindings in the store). Extent of this array would represent; ``size()`` and would be equal to the length of the list as written. So this sounds good, however apparently it does nothing to address our false; positives: when the list escapes, our ``RegionStoreManager`` is not magically; guessing that the metadata symbol attached to it, together with its contents,; should also escape. In fact, it's impossible to trigger a pointer escape from; within the checker. Approach (1): If only we enabled ``ProgramState::bindLoc(..., notifyChanges=true)``; to cause pointer escapes (not only region changes) (which sounds like the right; thing to do anyway) such checker would be able to solve the false positives by; triggering escapes when binding list elements to the list. However, it'd be as; conservative as the current patch's solution. Ideally, we do not want escapes to; happen so early. Instead, we'd prefer them to be delayed until the list itself; escapes. So i believe that escaping metadata symbols whenever their base regions escape; would be the right thing to do. Currently we didn't think about that because we; had neither pointer-type metadatas nor non-pointer escapes. Approach (2): We could teach the Store to scan itself for bindings to; metadata-symbolic-based regions during scanReachableSymbols() whenever a region; turns out to be reachable. This requires no work on checker side, but it sounds; performance-heavy. Approach (3): We could let checkers maintain the set of active metadata symbols; in the program state (ideally somewhere in the Store, which sounds weird but; causes the smallest amount of layering violations), so that the core knew what; to escape. This puts a stress on the checkers, but with a smart data map it; wouldn't be a problem.

For; changes that promise significant impact on users and/or downstream code bases,; reviewers can request an RFC achieving consensus before proceeding with code; review. That having been said, posting initial patches can help with; discussions on an RFC. Code-Review Workflow; ====================. Code review can be an iterative process, which continues until the patch is; ready to be committed. Specifically, once a patch is sent out for review, it; needs an explicit approval before it is committed. Do not assume silent; approval, or solicit objections to a patch with a deadline. Acknowledge All Reviewer Feedback; ---------------------------------. All comments by reviewers should be acknowledged by the patch author. It is; generally expected that suggested changes will be incorporated into a future; revision of the patch unless the author and/or other reviewers can articulate a; good reason to do otherwise (and then the reviewers must agree). If a new patch; does not address all outstanding feedback, the author should explicitly state; that when providing the updated patch. When using the web-based code-review; tool, such notes can be provided in the ""Diff"" description (which is different; from the description of the ""Differential Revision"" as a whole used for the; commit message). If you suggest changes in a code review, but don't wish the suggestion to be; interpreted this strongly, please state so explicitly. Aim to Make Efficient Use of Everyone's Time; --------------------------------------------. Aim to limit the number of iterations in the review process.

In buildbot; terms, we likely going to need multiple workers to build requests in parallel; under a single builder configuration.

This; is usually done by emitting either a full fence before the loads or a full; fence after the stores; which is preferred varies by architecture. Atomics and IR optimization; ===========================. Predicates for optimizer writers to query:. * ``isSimple()``: A load or store which is not volatile or atomic. This is; what, for example, memcpyopt would check for operations it might transform. * ``isUnordered()``: A load or store which is not volatile and at most; Unordered. This would be checked, for example, by LICM before hoisting an; operation. * ``mayReadFromMemory()``/``mayWriteToMemory()``: Existing predicate, but note; that they return true for any operation which is volatile or at least; Monotonic. * ``isStrongerThan`` / ``isAtLeastOrStrongerThan``: These are predicates on; orderings. They can be useful for passes that are aware of atomics, for; example to do DSE across a single atomic access, but not across a; release-acquire pair (see MemoryDependencyAnalysis for an example of this). * Alias analysis: Note that AA will return ModRef for anything Acquire or; Release, and for the address accessed by any Monotonic operation. To support optimizing around atomic operations, make sure you are using the; right predicates; everything should work if that is done. If your pass should; optimize some atomic operations (Unordered operations in particular), make sure; it doesn't replace an atomic load or store with a non-atomic operation. Some examples of how optimizations interact with various kinds of atomic; operations:. * ``memcpyopt``: An atomic operation cannot be optimized into part of a; memcpy/memset, including unordered loads/stores. It can pull operations; across some atomic operations. * LICM: Unordered loads/stores can be moved out of a loop.

The old name ```gROOTMutex``` and ```gInterpreterMutex``` are deprecated and may be removed in future releases.; - Added ```TReadLockGuard```,```TWriteLockGuard```, ```R__READ_LOCKGUARD``` and```R__WRITE_LOCKGUARD``` to take advantage of the new lock. The legacy ```TLockGuard``` and ```R__LOCKGUARD``` use the write lock.; - Improved scaling of TROOT::RecursiveRemove in the case of large collection.; - Added a thread safe mode for the following ROOT collections: THashList, THashTable, TList and TObjArray. When ROOT's thread safe mode is enabled and the collection is set to use internal locks by calling:; ```; collection->UseRWLock();; ```; all operations on the collection will take the read or write lock when needed, currently they shared the global lock (ROOT::gCoreMutex). ### Interpreter. - cling's LLVM is upgraded to version 5.0; - All of cling's patches to llvm have been upstreamed.; - The interpreter-related lock is now locking only the compilation step, not the execution step. This reduces the scope for lock contention. Most significantly, it enables the use of concurrency on the prompt!. ## I/O Libraries. - Introduce TKey::ReadObject<typeName>. This is a user friendly wrapper around ReadObjectAny. For example; ```; auto h1 = key->ReadObject<TH1>; ```; after which h1 will either be null if the key contains something that is not a TH1 (or derived class); or will be set to the address of the histogram read from the file.; - Add the ability to store the 'same' object several time (assumingly with different data) in a single buffer. Instead of. ```; while(...) {; TObjArray arr;; ... update the content of ""arr""; buffer << arr;; }; ```; which would only really stream the array at the first iteration because it will be detected has having the same address and thus assumed to be the same object.

Deployability,"design between the LTO optimizer and the linker. Design Philosophy; =================. The LLVM Link Time Optimizer provides complete transparency, while doing; intermodular optimization, in the compiler tool chain. Its main goal is to let; the developer take advantage of intermodular optimizations without making any; significant changes to the developer's makefiles or build system. This is; achieved through tight integration with the linker. In this model, the linker; treats LLVM bitcode files like native object files and allows mixing and; matching among them. The linker uses `libLTO`_, a shared object, to handle LLVM; bitcode files. This tight integration between the linker and LLVM optimizer; helps to do optimizations that are not possible in other models. The linker; input allows the optimizer to avoid relying on conservative escape analysis. .. _libLTO-example:. Example of link time optimization; ---------------------------------. The following example illustrates the advantages of LTO's integrated approach; and clean interface. This example requires a system linker which supports LTO; through the interface described in this document. Here, clang transparently; invokes system linker. * Input source file ``a.c`` is compiled into LLVM bitcode form.; * Input source file ``main.c`` is compiled into native object code. .. code-block:: c++. --- a.h ---; extern int foo1(void);; extern void foo2(void);; extern void foo4(void);. --- a.c ---; #include ""a.h"". static signed int i = 0;. void foo2(void) {; i = -1;; }. static int foo3() {; foo4();; return 10;; }. int foo1(void) {; int data = 0;. if (i < 0); data = foo3();. data = data + 42;; return data;; }. --- main.c ---; #include <stdio.h>; #include ""a.h"". void foo4(void) {; printf(""Hi\n"");; }. int main() {; return foo1();; }. To compile, run:. .. code-block:: console. % clang -flto -c a.c -o a.o # <-- a.o is LLVM bitcode file; % clang -c main.c -o main.o # <-- main.o is native object file; % clang -flto a.o main.o -o mai",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst:1467,integrat,integrated,1467,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.rst,1,['integrat'],['integrated']

If different cleanup code needs to get executed for different suspend points,; a similar switch will be in the `f.destroy` function. .. note ::. Using suspend index in a coroutine state and having a switch in `f.resume` and; `f.destroy` is one of the possible implementation strategies. We explored; another option where a distinct `f.resume1`, `f.resume2`, etc. are created for; every suspend point, and instead of storing an index, the resume and destroy; function pointers are updated at every suspend. Early testing showed that the; current approach is easier on the optimizer than the latter so it is a; lowering strategy implemented at the moment. Distinct Save and Suspend; -------------------------. In the previous example, setting a resume index (or some other state change that; needs to happen to prepare a coroutine for resumption) happens at the same time as; a suspension of a coroutine. However, in certain cases, it is necessary to control; when coroutine is prepared for resumption and when it is suspended. In the following example, a coroutine represents some activity that is driven; by completions of asynchronous operations `async_op1` and `async_op2` which get; a coroutine handle as a parameter and resume the coroutine once async; operation is finished. .. code-block:: text. void g() {; for (;;); if (cond()) {; async_op1(<coroutine-handle>); // will resume once async_op1 completes; <suspend>; do_one();; }",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Coroutines.rst:20315,update,updated,20315,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Coroutines.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Coroutines.rst,1,['update'],['updated']

Semantics of Reading Non-Trivial Objects; ========================================. Reading an object with RNTuple should be seen as _overwriting_ its persistent data members.; Given a properly constructed and valid object, the object must ensure that it stays valid when overwriting its persistent data members.; However, the object should not rely on its transient state to remain unchanged during reading:; it may be destructed and constructed again when it is read as part of a collection (see below). An object that is being read from disk may have been constructed by `RField::CreateValue()`.; In this case, the deleter returned by `RField::GetDeleter()` releases the resources. When reading collections of type `T` (`std::vector<T>`, `ROOT::RVec<T>`, ...), RNTuple uses `RField::CreateValue()` to construct elements of the inner type `T`.; As the size of a collection changes from event to event, this has the following effect on its elements; - If the collection shrinks, cut-off elements are destructed; - If the collection grows, new elements are constructed before reading them; - If the array buffer of the collection is reallocated (may happen for both shrinking and growing depending on the collection), all elements are destructed first in the old buffer; and the new number of elements is constructed in the new buffer. So unless the collection buffer needs to be reallocated, RNTuple tries to avoid unnecessary destruction/construction but instead overwrites existing objects.; Note that RNTuple currently does not copy or move existing objects when the collection buffer is reallocated.

Deployability,"distribution`` target described above is for building a single; distribution. LLVM's build system also supports building multiple distributions,; which can be used to e.g. have one distribution containing just tools and; another for libraries (to enable development). These are configured by setting; the *LLVM_DISTRIBUTIONS* variable to hold a list of all distribution names; (which conventionally start with an uppercase letter, e.g. ""Development""), and; then setting the *LLVM_<distribution>_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* variable to the; list of targets for that distribution. For each distribution, the build system; generates an ``install-${distribution}-distribution`` target, where; ``${distribution}`` is the name of the distribution in lowercase, to install; that distribution. Each distribution creates its own set of CMake exports, and the target to; install the CMake exports for a particular distribution for a project is named; ``${project}-${distribution}-cmake-exports``, where ``${project}`` is the name; of the project in lowercase and ``${distribution}`` is the name of the; distribution in lowercase, unless the project is LLVM, in which case the target; is just named ``${distribution}-cmake-exports``.

Unlike with the single distribution setup, when building multiple distributions,; any components specified in *LLVM_RUNTIME_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* are not; automatically added to any distribution. Instead, you must include the targets; explicitly in some *LLVM_<distribution>_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* list.

Release Qualification Criteria; ------------------------------. There are no official release qualification criteria. It is up to the; the release manager to determine when a release is ready. The release manager; should pay attention to the results of community testing, the number of outstanding; bugs, and then number of regressions when determining whether or not to make a; release. The community values time based releases, so releases should not be delayed for; too long unless there are critical issues remaining. In most cases, the only; kind of bugs that are critical enough to block a release would be a major regression; from a previous release. Official Testing; ----------------.

Check out the ``www-releases`` module from GitHub. #. Create a new sub-directory ``X.Y.Z`` in the releases directory. #. Copy and commit the ``llvm/docs`` and ``LICENSE.txt`` files into this new; directory. #. Update the ``releases/download.html`` file with links to the release; binaries on GitHub. #.

Deployability,"e LLVM repository should only use language features; available in this version of Python. The Python code within the LLVM repository should adhere to the formatting guidelines; outlined in `PEP 8 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>`_. For consistency and to limit churn, code should be automatically formatted with; the `black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ utility, which is PEP 8 compliant.; Use its default rules. For example, avoid specifying ``--line-length`` even; though it does not default to 80. The default rules can change between major; versions of black. In order to avoid unnecessary churn in the formatting rules,; we currently use black version 23.x in LLVM. When contributing a patch unrelated to formatting, you should format only the; Python code that the patch modifies. For this purpose, use the `darker; <https://pypi.org/project/darker/>`_ utility, which runs default black rules; over only the modified Python code. Doing so should ensure the patch will pass; the Python format checks in LLVM's pre-commit CI, which also uses darker. When; contributing a patch specifically for reformatting Python files, use black,; which currently only supports formatting entire files. Here are some quick examples, but see the black and darker documentation for; details:. .. code-block:: bash. $ pip install black=='23.*' darker # install black 23.x and darker; $ darker test.py # format uncommitted changes; $ darker -r HEAD^ test.py # also format changes from last commit; $ black test.py # format entire file. Instead of individual file names, you can specify directories to; darker, and it will find the changed files. However, if a directory is; large, like a clone of the LLVM repository, darker can be painfully; slow. In that case, you might wish to use git to list changed files.; For example:. .. code-block:: bash. $ darker -r HEAD^ $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=d HEAD^).

ROOT was, and still is, developed in the ""Bazaar style"", a term from; the book ""The Cathedral and the Bazaar"" by Eric S. Raymond. It means a; liberal, informal development style that heavily relies on the diverse; and deep talent of the user community. The result is that physicists; developed ROOT for themselves; this made it specific, appropriate,; useful, and over time refined and very powerful. The development of; ROOT is a continuous conversation between users and developers with; the line between the two blurring at times and the users becoming; co-developers.

Although M will of course solve easy problems faster than complicated; ones, it is not intended for the repeated solution of identically; parametrized problems (such as track fitting in a detector) where a; specialized program will in general be much more efficient. ## Further remarks ##. M was initially written in Fortran around 1975-1980 at CERN by Fred; James @bib-MINUIT. Its main field of usage is statistical data analysis; of experimental data recorded at CERN, but it is also used by people; doing data analysis outside CERN or outside high energy physics (HEP).; In 2002 Fred James started a project aiming to re-implement M in an; object-oriented way using . More information about recent developments, releases and installation; can be obtained from the M homepage @bib-C++MINUIT. The names of M applications are written in capital letters (e.g.; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, $\mbox{MINOS}$, $\mbox{CONTOURS}$), the; corresponding names of the classes are written using sans-serif font; type (MnMigrad, MnMinos, MnContours). # Introduction: M basic concepts #. [sec:intro]. ## The organization of M ##. The M package acts on a multiparameter *objective function* which is; called — for historical reasons — the $\mbox{FCN}$ function (see; [howto:fcn]). This function is usually a chisquared or a log–likelihood,; but it could also be a mathematical function. The $\mbox{FCN}$; function needs to be written in for which M defines the pure abstract; base class FCNBase as interface. The user must define and implement the; $\mbox{FCN}$ function in a derived class from FCNBase. Sometimes; this is done by an intermediate program such as HippoDraw@bib-HippoDraw,; in which case M is being used under the control of such an intermediat",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:1323,release,releases,1323,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,2,"['install', 'release']","['installation', 'releases']"

To use; them, simply modify your shell environment accordingly. For Unix:. `export PATH=$ROOTSYS/bin:$PYTHONDIR/bin:$PATH`. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. `export PYTHONPATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONPATH`. For Windows:. `set PATH=%ROOTSYS%/bin;%PYTHONDIR%/bin;%PATH%`. `set PYTHONPATH=%ROOTSYS%/bin;%PYTHONPATH%`. where `$ROOTSYS` should be set to; `/afs/cern.ch/sw/root/<version>/<platform>`, and `PYTHONDIR` to; `/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/Python/2.3.4/<platform>` with `<version>`; and `<platform>` as appropriate. Note that the latest version of Python; is 2.4.1. #### Building from Source. The standard installation instructions for building ROOT from source; apply, with the addition that the build of `PyROOT` needs to be enabled; at the configuration step. First, follow the instructions for obtaining; and unpacking the source, and setting up the build environment. Then, use the following command to configure the build process (of; course, feel free to add any additional flags you may need):. `$ ./configure <arch> [--with-python-incdir=<dir>][--with-python-libdir=>dir>]`. For details on `<arch>` see the official build pages, the Python include; directory should point to the directory that contains `Python.h` and the; library directory should point to the directory containing; `libpythonx.y.so`, where '`x`' and '`y`' are the major and minor version; number, respectively. If you do not specify include and library; directories explicitly, the configuration process will try the; `PYTHONDIR` environment variable or, alternatively, the standard; locations.

A way in which dictionaries can be generated is via the `rootcling`; utility. This tool generates takes as input a set of headers and; generates in output the dictionary C++ code and a `pcm` file.; This latter file is fundamental for the correct functioning of the; dictionary at runtime. It should be located in the directory where; the shared library is installed in which the compiled dictionary; resides. NOTA BENE: the dictionaries that will be used within the same project; must have unique names. In other words, compiled object files relative; to dictionary source files cannot reside in the same library or in; two libraries loaded by the same application if the original source; files have the same name.; This loose limitation is imposed by the registration mechanism ROOT; has in place to keep track of dynamically loaded libraries. In the following example, we walk through the steps necessary to; generate a dictionary, I/O, and inspect member functions. Let's start; with a **`TEvent`** class, which contains a collection of **`TTracks`**. The `TEvent.h` header is:. ``` {.cpp}; #ifndef __TEvent__; #define __TEvent__; #include ""TObject.h""; #include ""TCollection.h"". class TTrack;. class TEvent : public TObject {; private:; Int_t fId; // event sequential id; Float_t fTotalMom; // total momentum; TCollection *fTracks; // collection",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/AddingaClass.md:13669,install,installed,13669,documentation/users-guide/AddingaClass.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/AddingaClass.md,1,['install'],['installed']

The first line enables :program:`clang-format` for NORMAL and VISUAL mode, the; second line adds support for INSERT mode. Change ""C-K"" to another binding if; you need :program:`clang-format` on a different key (C-K stands for Ctrl+k). With this integration you can press the bound key and clang-format will; format the current line in NORMAL and INSERT mode or the selected region in; VISUAL mode. The line or region is extended to the next bigger syntactic; entity. It operates on the current, potentially unsaved buffer and does not create; or save any files. To revert a formatting, just undo. An alternative option is to format changes when saving a file and thus to; have a zero-effort integration into the coding workflow. To do this, add this to; your `.vimrc`:. .. code-block:: vim. function!

This is an example to define first the function object. ``` {.cpp}; class MyFunctionObject {; public:; // use constructor to customize your function object; MyFunctionObject(......) { ......}. double operator() (double *x, double *p) {; // function implementation using class data members; }; };; ```. and then use it to create the **`TF1`**:. ```{.cpp}; MyFunctionObject fobj(....); // create the function object; TF1 * f = new TF1(""f"",fobj,xmin,xmax,npar); // create TF1 class with n-parameters and range [xmin,xmax]; ```. If using C++11, one can create a **`TF1`** also from a C++ `lambda` function:. ```{.cpp}; // create TF1 class with 2 parameters and range [xmin,xmax] using a lambda; TF1 * f = new TF1(""f"",[](double*x,double*p){return p[0] + p[1]*x[0];},xmin,xmax,2);; ```. ## Configuring the Fit. We will show here some configuration actions that can or must be done; when fitting histogram or graph using the `Fit` method. ### Fixing and Setting Parameters' Bounds. Parameters must be initialized before invoking the `Fit` method. The; setting of the parameter initial values is automatic for the; predefined functions: `poln`, `exp`, `gaus`, and `landau`. You can fix; one or more parameters by specifying the ""B"" option when calling the; `Fit` method. When a function is not predefined, the fit parameters; must be initialized to some value as close as possible to the expected; values before calling the fit function. To set bounds for one parameter, use `TF1::SetParLimits`:. ``` {.cpp}; func->SetParLimits(0,-1,1);; ```. When the lower and upper limits are equal, the parameter is fixed.; Next two statements fix parameter 4 at 10. ``` {.cpp}; func->SetParameter(4,10);; func->SetParLimits(4,10,10);; ```. However, to fix a parameter to 0, one must call the `FixParameter`; function:. ``` {.cpp}; func->SetParameter(4,0);; func->FixParameter(4,0);; ```.

Since there is a tight; correspondence between what is seen on the screen and the object in; memory, changing the object changes it on the screen. For example, try; to do:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] a.SetX1(0.9); ```. This should change one of the coordinates of our line, but nothing; happens on the screen. Why is that? In short, the canvas is not updated; with each change for performance reasons. See ""Updating the Pad"". ### Selecting Objects. #### The Middle Mouse Button. Objects in a canvas, as well as in a pad, are stacked on top of each; other in the order they were drawn. Some objects may become ""active""; objects, which mean they are reordered to be on top of the others. To; interactively make an object ""active"", you can use the middle mouse; button. In case of canvases or pads, the border becomes highlighted when; it is active. #### With C++ Statements (Programmatically). Frequently we want to draw in different canvases or pads. By default,; the objects are drawn in the active canvas. To activate a canvas you can; use the `TPad::cd()` method. ``` {.cpp}; root[] c1->cd(); ```. ### Context Menus: the Right Mouse Button.

Any pdf term appearing in a product that does not contain an observable and shares one or more parameters; with another pdf term in the same product that does contain an observable is automatically picked up as a constraint term.; For example given a dataset D(x) which defines variable x as observable, the default logic works out as follows. F(x,a,b)*G(a,a0,a1) --> G is constraint term (a also appears in F(x)); F(x,a,b)*G(y,c,d) --> G is dropped (factorizing term). A Constrain(y) term in the above example will still force term G(y,c,d) to be interpreted as constraint term; Automatic caching of numeric integral calculations; Integrals that require numeric integrations in two of more dimensions are now automatically cached in the expensive object store.; The expensive object store allows to cache such values between difference instance of integral objects that represent the; same configuration. If integrals are created from an object (function or pdf) that live in a RooWorkspace the ; expensive object cache of the workspace will be used instead of the global store instance, and values stored in the workspace; store will also be persisted if the workspace is persisted.

Deployability,"e native ``__weak`` support to ensure; calling convention compatibility, this transfer is always handled; automatically by the compiler. .. admonition:: Rationale. In earlier releases, when non-trivial ownership was only permitted; on fields in Objective-C++, the ABI used for such classes was the; ordinary ABI for non-trivial C++ classes, which passes arguments and; returns indirectly and does not transfer responsibility for arguments.; When support for Objective-C structs was added, it was decided to; change to the current ABI for three reasons:. - It permits ARC / non-ARC compatibility for structs containing only; ``__strong`` references, as long as the non-ARC side is careful about; transferring ownership. - It avoids unnecessary indirection for sufficiently small types that; the C ABI would prefer to pass in registers. - Given that struct arguments must be produced at +1 to satisfy C's; semantics of initializing the local parameter variable, transferring; ownership of that copy to the callee is generally better for ARC; optimization, since otherwise there will be releases in the caller; that are much harder to pair with transfers in the callee. Breaking compatibility with existing Objective-C++ structures was; considered an acceptable cost, as most Objective-C++ code does not have; binary-compatibility requirements. Any existing code which cannot accept; this compatibility break, which is necessarily Objective-C++, should; force the use of the standard C++ ABI by declaring an empty (but; non-defaulted) destructor. .. _arc.ownership.inference:.

This highly dependent on the class that; is being transformed for AD support, but will be necessary in those specific; instances. Let's consider a fictional class RooFoo, that performs some arbitrary; mathematical operations called 'Foo' (as seen in doFoo() function below). > Note that doFoo is a simplified example, in many cases the mathematical; operations are not limited to a single function, so they need to be spotted; within the `evaluate()` function. ``` {.cpp}; class RooFoo : public RooAbsReal {; int a;; int b;; int doFoo() { return a* b + a + b; }; int integralFoo() { return /* whatever */;}; public:; // Other functions...; double evaluate() override {; // Do some bookkeeping; return doFoo();; };; double analyticalIntegral(Int_t code, const char* rangeName) override {; // Select the right paths for integration using codes or whatever.; return integralFoo();; }; };; ```. \note All RooFit classes are deriving from the RooAbsReal object, but; its details are not relevant to the current example. Note how the `evaluate()` function overrides the `RooAbsReal` for the RooFoo; class. Similarly, the `analyticalIntegral()` function has also been overridden; from the `RooAbsReal` class. The `evaluate()` function includes some bookkeeping steps (commented out in; above example) that are not relevant to AD. The important part is that it; calls a specific function (doFoo() in this example), and returns the results. Similarly, the `analyticalIntegral()` function calls a specific function (; `integralFoo()` in this example), and returns the results. It may also include; some code that may need to be looked at, but for simplicity, its contents are; commented out in this example. #### Adding Code Generation Support to RooFoo cl",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md:19676,integrat,integration,19676,roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md,1,['integrat'],['integration']

And we have arranged for that; value to be particularly effective when used below to harden loads. ##### Indirect Call, Branch, and Return Predicates. There is no analogous flag to use when tracing indirect calls, branches, and; returns. The predicate state must be accumulated through some other means.; Fundamentally, this is the reverse of the problem posed in CFI: we need to; check where we came from rather than where we are going. For function-local; jump tables, this is easily arranged by testing the input to the jump table; within each destination (not yet implemented, use retpolines):; ```; pushq %rax; xorl %eax, %eax # Zero out initial predicate state.; movq $-1, %r8 # Put all-ones mask into a register.; jmpq *.LJTI0_0(,%rdi,8) # Indirect jump through table.; .LBB0_2: # %sw.bb; testq $0, %rdi # Validate index used for jump table.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; jmp _Z4leaki # TAILCALL. .LBB0_3: # %sw.bb1; testq $1, %rdi # Validate index used for jump table.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; jmp _Z4leaki # TAILCALL. .LBB0_5: # %sw.bb10; testq $2, %rdi # Validate index used for jump table.; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; ...; jmp _Z4leaki # TAILCALL; ... .section .rodata,""a"",@progbits; .p2align 3; .LJTI0_0:; .quad .LBB0_2; .quad .LBB0_3; .quad .LBB0_5; ...; ```. Returns have a simple mitigation technique on x86-64 (or other ABIs which have; what is called a ""red zone"" region beyond the end of the stack). This region is; guaranteed to be preserved across interrupts and context switches, making the; return address used in returning to the current code remain on the stack and; valid to read.

When you call the `Draw` method of a histogram ( **`TH1`**` ::Draw` ); for the first time, it creates a **`THistPainter`** object and saves a; pointer to painter as a data member of the histogram. The; **`THistPainter`** class specializes in the drawing of histograms. It; allows logarithmic axes (x, y, z) when the CONT drawing option is; using. The **`THistPainter`** class is separated from the histogram so; that one can have histograms without the graphics overhead, for; example in a batch program. The choice to give each histogram has its; own painter rather than a central singleton painter, allows two; histograms to be drawn in two threads without overwriting the; painter's values. When a displayed histogram is filled again, you do; not have to call the `Draw` method again. The image is refreshed the; next time the pad is updated. A pad is updated after one of these; three actions:. - A carriage control on the ROOT command line. - A click inside the pad. - A call to **`TPad`**`::Update()`. By default, the **`TH1`**`::Draw` clears the pad before drawing the; new image of the histogram. You can use the `""SAME""` option to leave; the previous display intact and superimpose the new histogram. The; same histogram can be drawn with different graphics options in; different pads. When a displayed histogram is deleted, its image is; automatically removed from the pad. To create a copy of the histogram; when drawing it, you can use **`TH1`**`::DrawClone()`. This will clone; the histogram and allow you to change and delete the original one; without affecting the clone. You can use **`TH1`**`::DrawNormalized()`; to draw a normalized copy of a histogram. ``` {.cpp}; TH1 *TH1::DrawNormalized(Option_t *option,Double_t norm) const; ```.

Deployability,"e resource; cycles to the machine instruction in the sequence. For example, every iteration; of the instruction vmulps always executes on resource unit [6]; (JFPU1 - floating point pipeline #1), consuming an average of 1 resource cycle; per iteration. Note that on AMD Jaguar, vector floating-point multiply can; only be issued to pipeline JFPU1, while horizontal floating-point additions can; only be issued to pipeline JFPU0. The resource pressure view helps with identifying bottlenecks caused by high; usage of specific hardware resources. Situations with resource pressure mainly; concentrated on a few resources should, in general, be avoided. Ideally,; pressure should be uniformly distributed between multiple resources. Timeline View; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^; The timeline view produces a detailed report of each instruction's state; transitions through an instruction pipeline. This view is enabled by the; command line option ``-timeline``. As instructions transition through the; various stages of the pipeline, their states are depicted in the view report.; These states are represented by the following characters:. * D : Instruction dispatched.; * e : Instruction executing.; * E : Instruction executed.; * R : Instruction retired.; * = : Instruction already dispatched, waiting to be executed.; * \- : Instruction executed, waiting to be retired.

Deployability,"e split-level is 1, an object data member is assigned a branch.; If the split-level is 2, the data member objects will be split also, and; a split level of 3 its data members objects, will be split. As the; split-level increases so does the splitting depth. The ROOT default for; the split-level is 99. This means the object will be split to the; maximum. #### Memory Considerations when Splitting a Branch. Splitting a branch can quickly generate many branches. Each branch has; its own buffer in memory. In case of many branches (say more than 100),; you should adjust the buffer size accordingly. A recommended buffer size; is 32000 bytes if you have less than 50 branches. Around 16000 bytes if; you have less than 100 branches and 4000 bytes if you have more than 500; branches. These numbers are recommended for computers with memory size; ranging from 32MB to 256MB. If you have more memory, you should specify; larger buffer sizes. However, in this case, do not forget that your file; might be used on another machine with a smaller memory configuration. #### Performance Considerations when Splitting a Branch. A split branch is faster to read, but slightly slower to write. The; reading is quicker because variables of the same type are stored; consecutively and the type does not have to be read each time. It is; slower to write because of the large number of buffers as described; above. See "". Performance Benchmarks"" for performance impact of split and non-split; mode. #### Rules for Splitting. When splitting a branch, variables of different types are handled; differently. Here are the rules that apply when splitting a branch. - If a data member is a basic type, it becomes one branch of class; **`TBranchElement`**. - A data member can be an array of basic types. In this case, one; single branch is created for the array. - A data member can be a pointer to an array of basic types. The; length can vary, and must be specified in the comment field of the; data member in the class",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:26389,configurat,configuration,26389,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Deployability,"e timeline view is identified by a pair of indices, where; the first index identifies an iteration, and the second index is the; instruction index (i.e., where it appears in the code sequence). Since this; example was generated using 3 iterations: ``-iterations=3``, the iteration; indices range from 0-2 inclusively. Excluding the first and last column, the remaining columns are in cycles.; Cycles are numbered sequentially starting from 0. From the example output above, we know the following:. * Instruction [1,0] was dispatched at cycle 1.; * Instruction [1,0] started executing at cycle 2.; * Instruction [1,0] reached the write back stage at cycle 4.; * Instruction [1,0] was retired at cycle 10. Instruction [1,0] (i.e., vmulps from iteration #1) does not have to wait in the; scheduler's queue for the operands to become available. By the time vmulps is; dispatched, operands are already available, and pipeline JFPU1 is ready to; serve another instruction. So the instruction can be immediately issued on the; JFPU1 pipeline. That is demonstrated by the fact that the instruction only; spent 1cy in the scheduler's queue. There is a gap of 5 cycles between the write-back stage and the retire event.; That is because instructions must retire in program order, so [1,0] has to wait; for [0,2] to be retired first (i.e., it has to wait until cycle 10). In the example, all instructions are in a RAW (Read After Write) dependency; chain. Register %xmm2 written by vmulps is immediately used by the first; vhaddps, and register %xmm3 written by the first vhaddps is used by the second; vhaddps. Long data dependencies negatively impact the ILP (Instruction Level; Parallelism). In the dot-product example, there are anti-dependencies introduced by; instructions from different iterations. However, those dependencies can be; removed at register renaming stage (at the cost of allocating register aliases,; and therefore consuming physical registers).

Basic-mode specific; defaults can be provided in the ``XRAY_BASIC_OPTIONS`` environment variable. Flight Data Recorder Mode; -------------------------. XRay supports a logging mode which allows the application to only capture a; fixed amount of memory's worth of events. Flight Data Recorder (FDR) mode works; very much like a plane's ""black box"" which keeps recording data to memory in a; fixed-size circular queue of buffers, and have the data available; programmatically until the buffers are finalized and flushed. To use FDR mode; on your application, you may set the ``xray_mode`` variable to ``xray-fdr`` in; the ``XRAY_OPTIONS`` environment variable. Additional options to the FDR mode; implementation can be provided in the ``XRAY_FDR_OPTIONS`` environment; variable. Programmatic configuration can be done by calling; ``__xray_log_init_mode(""xray-fdr"", <configuration string>)`` once it has been; selected/installed. When the buffers are flushed to disk, the result is a binary trace format; described by `XRay FDR format <XRayFDRFormat.html>`_. When FDR mode is on, it will keep writing and recycling memory buffers until; the logging implementation is finalized -- at which point it can be flushed and; re-initialised later. To do this programmatically, we follow the workflow; provided below:. .. code-block:: c++. // Patch the sleds, if we haven't yet.; auto patch_status = __xray_patch();. // Maybe handle the patch_status errors. // When we want to flush the log, we need to finalize it first, to give; // threads a chance to return buffers to the queue.; auto finalize_status = __xray_log_finalize();; if (finalize_status != XRAY_LOG_FINALIZED) {; // maybe retry, or bail out.; }. // At this point, we are sure that the log is finalized, so we may try; // flushing the log.; auto flush_status = __xray_log_flushLog();; if (flush_statu",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/XRay.rst:9451,configurat,configuration,9451,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/XRay.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/XRay.rst,3,"['configurat', 'install']","['configuration', 'installed']"

However, this will cause ``!3`` to have the return value of ``@gazonk()`` at; the same time as ``!1`` has the constant value zero -- a pair of assignments; that never occurred in the unoptimized program. To avoid this, we must terminate; the range that ``!1`` has the constant value assignment by inserting a poison; dbg.value before the dbg.value for ``!3``:. .. code-block:: llvm. define i32 @foo(i32 %bar, i1 %cond) {; entry:; call @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 0, metadata !1, metadata !2); %g = call i32 @gazonk(); call @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 poison, metadata !1, metadata !2); call @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 %g, metadata !3, metadata !2); %addoper = select i1 %cond, i32 11, i32 12; %plusten = add i32 %bar, %addoper; %toret = add i32 %plusten, %g; call @llvm.dbg.value(metadata i32 %toret, metadata !1, metadata !2); ret i32 %toret; }. There are a few other dbg.value configurations that mean it terminates; dominating location definitions without adding a new location. The complete; list is:. * Any location operand is ``poison`` (or ``undef``).; * Any location operand is an empty metadata tuple (``!{}``) (which cannot; occur in a ``!DIArgList``).; * There are no location operands (empty ``DIArgList``) and the ``DIExpression``; is empty. This class of dbg.value that kills variable locations is called a ""kill; dbg.value"" or ""kill location"", and for legacy reasons the term ""undef; dbg.value"" may be used in existing code. The ``DbgVariableIntrinsic`` methods; ``isKillLocation`` and ``setKillLocation`` should be used where possible rather; than inspecting location operands directly to check or set whether a dbg.value; is a kill location. In general, if any dbg.value has its operand optimized out and cannot be; recovered, then a kill dbg.value is necessary to terminate earlier variable; locations.

Deployability,"e, a ""liveout"" register list is also recorded. These; are the registers that are live across the stackmap and therefore must; be saved by the runtime. This is an important optimization when the; patchpoint intrinsic is used with a calling convention that by default; preserves most registers as callee-save. Each entry in the liveout register list contains a DWARF register; number and size in bytes. The stackmap format deliberately omits; specific subregister information. Instead the runtime must interpret; this information conservatively. For example, if the stackmap reports; one byte at ``%rax``, then the value may be in either ``%al`` or; ``%ah``. It doesn't matter in practice, because the runtime will; simply save ``%rax``. However, if the stackmap reports 16 bytes at; ``%ymm0``, then the runtime can safely optimize by saving only; ``%xmm0``. The stack map format is a contract between an LLVM SVN revision and; the runtime. It is currently experimental and may change in the short; term, but minimizing the need to update the runtime is; important. Consequently, the stack map design is motivated by; simplicity and extensibility. Compactness of the representation is; secondary because the runtime is expected to parse the data; immediately after compiling a module and encode the information in its; own format. Since the runtime controls the allocation of sections, it; can reuse the same stack map space for multiple modules. Stackmap support is currently only implemented for 64-bit; platforms. However, a 32-bit implementation should be able to use the; same format with an insignificant amount of wasted space. .. _stackmap-section:. Stack Map Section; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

Deployability,"e. Note that the most general form of a ``landingpad``; instruction can have any number of catch, cleanup, and filter clauses (though; having more than one cleanup is pointless). The LLVM C++ front-end can generate; such ``landingpad`` instructions due to inlining creating nested exception; handling scopes. Restrictions; ------------. The unwinder delegates the decision of whether to stop in a call frame to that; call frame's language-specific personality function. Not all unwinders guarantee; that they will stop to perform cleanups. For example, the GNU C++ unwinder; doesn't do so unless the exception is actually caught somewhere further up the; stack. In order for inlining to behave correctly, landing pads must be prepared to; handle selector results that they did not originally advertise. Suppose that a; function catches exceptions of type ``A``, and it's inlined into a function that; catches exceptions of type ``B``. The inliner will update the ``landingpad``; instruction for the inlined landing pad to include the fact that ``B`` is also; caught. If that landing pad assumes that it will only be entered to catch an; ``A``, it's in for a rude awakening. Consequently, landing pads must test for; the selector results they understand and then resume exception propagation with; the `resume instruction <LangRef.html#i_resume>`_ if none of the conditions; match. Exception Handling Intrinsics; =============================. In addition to the ``landingpad`` and ``resume`` instructions, LLVM uses several; intrinsic functions (name prefixed with ``llvm.eh``) to provide exception; handling information at various points in generated code. .. _llvm.eh.typeid.for:. ``llvm.eh.typeid.for``; ----------------------. .. code-block:: llvm. i32 @llvm.eh.typeid.for(i8* %type_info).

This does not impact code that only makes use of entities in the public ROOT namespace, and should not impact downstream code unless it was patching or reusing internal `RDataFrame` types. ### Notable bug fixes and improvements. - A critical issue has been fixed that could potentially result in wrong data being silently read in multi-thread runs when an input `TChain` contained more than one `TTree` coming from the _same_ input file. More details are available at [#7143](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7143).; - The start-up time of event loops with large computation graphs with many just-in-time-compiled expressions (e.g. thousands of string `Filter`s and `Define`s) has been greatly reduced.

The new package allows distributing RDataFrame applications through one of the supported distributed backends. The package was designed so that different backends can be easily plugged in. Currently the [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) backend is supported and support for [Dask](https://dask.org/) is coming soon. The backend submodules of this package expose their own `RDataFrame` objects. The only needed change in user code is to substitute `ROOT.RDataFrame` calls with such backend-specific `RDataFrame`s.

Deployability,"e: Distributions should never be built using the; *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* CMake option. That option exists for optimizing developer; workflow only. Due to design and implementation decisions, LLVM relies on; global data which can end up being duplicated across shared libraries; resulting in bugs. As such this is not a safe way to distribute LLVM or; LLVM-based tools. The simplest example of building a distribution with reasonable performance is; captured in the DistributionExample CMake cache file located at; clang/cmake/caches/DistributionExample.cmake. The following command will perform; and install the distribution build:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -G Ninja -C <path to clang>/cmake/caches/DistributionExample.cmake <path to LLVM source>; $ ninja stage2-distribution; $ ninja stage2-install-distribution. Difference between ``install`` and ``install-distribution``; -----------------------------------------------------------. One subtle but important thing to note is the difference between the ``install``; and ``install-distribution`` targets. The ``install`` target is expected to; install every part of LLVM that your build is configured to generate except the; LLVM testing tools. Alternatively the ``install-distribution`` target, which is; recommended for building distributions, only installs specific parts of LLVM as; specified at configuration time by *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS*. Additionally by default the ``install`` target will install the LLVM testing; tools as the public tools. This can be changed well by setting; *LLVM_INSTALL_TOOLCHAIN_ONLY* to ``On``. The LLVM tools are intended for; development and testing of LLVM, and should only be included in distributions; that support LLVM development. When building with *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* the build system also; generates a ``distribution`` target which builds all the components specified in; the list. This is a convenience build target to allow building just the; distributed pieces without needing t",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst:3136,install,install,3136,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,2,['install'],"['install', 'install-distribution']"
Deployability,"e:. ``zicntr``, ``zicsr``, ``zifencei``, ``zihpm``; Between versions 2.0 and 2.1 of the base I specification, a backwards incompatible change was made to remove selected instructions and CSRs from the base ISA. These instructions were grouped into a set of new extensions, but were no longer required by the base ISA. This change is partially described in ""Preface to Document Version 20190608-Base-Ratified"" from the specification document (the ``zicntr`` and ``zihpm`` bits are not mentioned). LLVM currently implements version 2.1 of the base specification. To maintain compatibility, instructions from these extensions are accepted without being in the ``-march`` string. LLVM also allows the explicit specification of the extensions in an ``-march`` string. .. _riscv-profiles-extensions-note:. ``Za128rs``, ``Za64rs``, ``Zic64b``, ``Ziccamoa``, ``Ziccif``, ``Zicclsm``, ``Ziccrse``; These extensions are defined as part of the `RISC-V Profiles specification <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-profiles/releases/tag/v1.0>`_. They do not introduce any new features themselves, but instead describe existing hardware features. Experimental Extensions; =======================. LLVM supports (to various degrees) a number of experimental extensions. All experimental extensions have ``experimental-`` as a prefix. There is explicitly no compatibility promised between versions of the toolchain, and regular users are strongly advised *not* to make use of experimental extensions before they reach ratification. The primary goal of experimental support is to assist in the process of ratification by providing an existence proof of an implementation, and simplifying efforts to validate the value of a proposed extension against large code bases. Experimental extensions are expected to either transition to ratified status, or be eventually removed. The decision on whether to accept an experimental extension is currently done on an entirely case by case basis; if you want to propose one, attending t",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/RISCVUsage.rst:9309,release,releases,9309,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/RISCVUsage.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/RISCVUsage.rst,1,['release'],['releases']
Deployability,"e; generalized to support location descriptions that can have multiple places. This; is backwards compatible with DWARF Version 5 and allows objects with multiple; places to be supported. For example, the expression that describes how to access; the field of an object can be evaluated with a location description that has; multiple places and will result in a location description with multiple places. With this change, the separate DWARF Version 5 sections that described DWARF; expressions and location lists are unified into a single section that describes; DWARF expressions in general. This unification is a natural consequence of, and; a necessity of, allowing location descriptions to be part of the evaluation; stack. See :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-location-description`. 2.4 Generalize Offsetting of Location Descriptions; --------------------------------------------------. The ``DW_OP_plus`` and ``DW_OP_minus`` operations can be defined to operate on a; memory location description in the default target architecture specific address; space and a generic type value to produce an updated memory location; description. This allows them to continue to be used to offset an address. To generalize offsetting to any location description, including location; descriptions that describe when bytes are in registers, are implicit, or a; composite of these, the ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset``, ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset_uconst``, and; ``DW_OP_LLVM_bit_offset`` offset operations are added. The offset operations can operate on location storage of any size. For example,; implicit location storage could be any number of bits in size. It is simpler to; define offsets that exceed the size of the location storage as being an; evaluation error, than having to force an implementation to support potentially; infinite precision offsets to allow it to correctly track a series of positive; and negative offsets that may transiently overflow or underflow, but end up in; range.

FileCheck defaults to ignoring horizontal whitespace; differences (e.g. a space is allowed to match a tab) but otherwise, the contents; of the ""``CHECK:``"" line is required to match some thing in the test file exactly. One nice thing about FileCheck (compared to grep) is that it allows merging; test cases together into logical groups. For example, because the test above; is checking for the ""``sub1:``"" and ""``inc4:``"" labels, it will not match; unless there is a ""``subl``"" in between those labels.

The following two kinds of intrinsics can be used to implement stack; maps and patch points: ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` and; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``. Both kinds of intrinsics generate a; stack map record, and they both allow some form of code patching. They; can be used independently (i.e. ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``; implicitly generates a stack map without the need for an additional; call to ``llvm.experimental.stackmap``). The choice of which to use; depends on whether it is necessary to reserve space for code patching; and whether any of the intrinsic arguments should be lowered according; to calling conventions. ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` does not; reserve any space, nor does it expect any call arguments. If the; runtime patches code at the stack map's address, it will destructively; overwrite the program text. This is unlike; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``, which reserves space for in-place; patching without overwriting surrounding code. The; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint`` intrinsic also lowers a specified; number of arguments according to its calling convention. This allows; patched code to make in-place function calls without marshaling. Each instance of one of these intrinsics generates a stack map record; in the :ref:`stackmap-section`.

Since these extensions allow location descriptions to be entries on the; stack, a simpler operation to create composite location descriptions could; be defined. For example, just one operation that specifies how many parts,; and pops pairs of stack entries for the part size and location; description. Not only would this be a simpler operation and avoid the; complexities of incomplete composite location descriptions, but it may; also have a smaller encoding in practice. However, the desire for; compatibility with DWARF Version 5 is likely a stronger consideration. 2. ``DW_OP_bit_piece``. ``DW_OP_bit_piece`` has two operands. The first is an unsigned LEB128; integer that represents the part bit size S. The second is an unsigned; LEB128 integer that represents a bit displacement B. The action is the same as for ``DW_OP_piece``, except that any part created; has the bit size S, and the location description PL of any created part is; updated as if the ``DW_OP_constu B; DW_OP_LLVM_bit_offset`` operations were; applied. ``DW_OP_bit_piece`` *is used instead of* ``DW_OP_piece`` *when the piece to; be assembled is not byte-sized or is not at the start of the part location; description.*. *If a computed bit displacement is required, the* ``DW_OP_LLVM_bit_offset``; *operation can be used to update the location description before using it as; the part location description of a* ``DW_OP_bit_piece`` *operation.*. .. note::. The bit offset operand is not needed as ``DW_OP_LLVM_bit_offset`` can be; used on the part's location description. 3. ``DW_OP_LLVM_piece_end`` *New*. If the top stack entry is not a location description L comprised of one; incomplete composite location description SL, then the DWARF expression is; ill-formed. Otherwise, the incomplete composite location storage LS specified by SL is; updated to be a complete composite location description with the same parts. 4. ``DW_OP_L",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst:136808,update,updated,136808,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging.rst,1,['update'],['updated']

Precommit workflow for tests; ----------------------------. If the test does not crash, assert, or infinite loop, commit the test with; baseline check-lines first. That is, the test will show a miscompile or; missing optimization. Add a ""TODO"" or ""FIXME"" comment to indicate that; something is expected to change in a test. A follow-up patch with code changes to the compiler will then show check-line; differences to the tests, so it is easier to see the effect of the patch.; Remove TODO/FIXME comments added in the previous step if a problem is solved. Baseline tests (no-functional-change or NFC patch) may be pushed to main; without pre-commit review if you have commit access. Best practices for regression tests; -----------------------------------. - Use auto-generated check lines (produced by the scripts mentioned above); whenever feasible.; - Include comments about what is tested/expected in a particular test. If there; are relevant issues in the bug tracker, add references to those bug reports; (for example, ""See PR999 for more details"").; - Avoid undefined behavior and poison/undef values unless necessary.

When M needs to be guided to the ""right"" minimum, often the best way to; do this is with the methods e.g. MnMigrad::fix(...) and; MnMigrad::release(...). That is, suppose you have a problem with ten; free parameters, and when you minimize with respect to all at once, M; goes to an unphysical solution characterized by an unphysical or; unwanted value of parameter number four. One way to avoid this is to fix; parameter four at a ""good"" value (not necessarily the best, since you; presumably don't know that yet), and minimize with respect to the; others. Then release parameter four and minimize again. If the problem; admits a ""good"" physical solution, you will normally find it this way.; If it doesn't work, you may see what is wrong by the following sequence; (where $\mbox{xxx}$ is the expected physical value for parameter; four):. MnMigrad migrad(...);; migrad.setValue(4, xxx);; migrad.fix(4);; FunctionMinimum min = migrad();; migrad.release(4);; MnScan scan(...);; std::vector<std::pair<double, double> > points = scan(4);. where $\mbox{SCAN}$ gives you a picture of $\mbox{FCN}$ as a; function of parameter four alone, the others being fixed at their; current best values. If you suspect the difficulty is due to parameter; five, then add. MnContours contour(...);; std::vector<std::pair<double, double> > points = contour(4, 5);. to see a two-dimensional picture. ## Interpretation of parameter errors ##.

Deployability,"eap objects are so common in an object-oriented; program that pointer names rarely reflect the fact - you have to be; careful that you know if you are dealing with an object or its; pointer! Fortunately, the compiler won't tolerate an attempt to do; something like:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] my_objptr.Solve();; ```. As we have seen, heap objects; have to be accessed via pointers, whereas stack objects can be; accessed directly. They can also be accessed via pointers:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] Quad stack_quad(1.,2.,-3.);; root[] Quad *stack_ptr = &stack_quad;; root[] stack_ptr->Solve();; ```. Here we have a `Quad` pointer that has been initialized with the; address of a stack object. Be very careful if you take the address of; stack objects. As we shall see soon, they are deleted automatically,; which could leave you with an illegal pointer. Using it will corrupt; and may as well crash the program!. It is time to look at the destruction of objects. A destructor is a; special C++ function that releases resources for (or destroys) an; object of a class. It is the opposite of a constructor that creates the; object of a class when it is called. The compiler will provide a; destructor that does nothing if none is provided. We will add one to; our Quad class so that we can see when it is called. The class names; the destructor but with a prefix \~ which is the C++ one's complement; i.e. bit wise complement, and hence has destruction overtones! We; declare it in the .h file and define it in the `.cxx` file. It does; not do much except print out that it has been called (still a useful; debug technique despite today's powerful debuggers!). Now run root, load the Quad class and create a heap object:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .L Quad.cxx; root[] Quad *my_objptr = new Quad(1.,2.,-3.);; ```. To delete the object:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] delete my_objptr;; root[] my_objptr = 0;; ```. You should see the print out from its destructor.

Now the recommended way; to select the C++ standard is via the option `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=XX`, which; is the idiomatic way to do it in CMake. The old options still work, but have; been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Build option descriptions have been updated to indicate which builtins require; an active network connection during the build. You can inspect the list of; options and their descriptions by running `cmake -LH $PWD` in the build; directory.

The development of this package has moved to a [separate project](https://github.com/vmc-project/). ROOT's copy of VMC was deprecated since v6.18.; - `TTreeProcessorMT::SetMaxTasksPerFilePerWorker` has been removed. `TTreeProcessorMT::SetTasksPerWorkerHint` is a superior alternative.; - `TTree::GetEntry()` and `TTree::GetEvent()` no longer have 0 as the default value for the first parameter `entry`. We are not aware of correct uses of this function without providing an entry number. If you have one, please simply pass `0` from now on.; - `TBufferMerger` is now out of the `Experimental` namespace (`ROOT::Experimental::TBufferMerger` is deprecated, please use `ROOT::TBufferMerger` instead); - RooFit container classes marked as deprecated with this release: `RooHashTable`, `RooNameSet`, `RooSetPair`, and `RooList`. These classes are still available in this release, but will be removed in the next one. Please migrate to STL container classes, such as `std::unordered_map`, `std::set`, and `std::vector`.; - The `RooFit::FitOptions(const char*)` command to steer [RooAbsPdf::fitTo()](https://root.cern.ch/doc/v628/classRooAbsPdf.html) with an option string in now deprecated and will be removed in ROOT v6.28.

Each *identifier* in the *config-macro-list* specifies the name of a macro. The compiler is required to maintain different variants of the given module for differing definitions of any of the named macros. A *config-macros-declaration* shall only be present on a top-level module, i.e., a module that is not nested within an enclosing module. The ``exhaustive`` attribute specifies that the list of macros in the *config-macros-declaration* is exhaustive, meaning that no other macro definition is intended to have an effect on the API of that module. .. note::. The ``exhaustive`` attribute implies that any macro definitions; for macros not listed as configuration macros should be ignored; completely when building the module. As an optimization, the; compiler could reduce the number of unique module variants by not; considering these non-configuration macros. This optimization is not; yet implemented in Clang. A translation unit shall not import the same module under different definitions of the configuration macros. .. note::. Clang implements a weak form of this requirement: the definitions; used for configuration macros are fixed based on the definitions; provided by the command line.

The diagram below illustrates the logical view of the; **`TFile`** and **`TKey`**. ![ROOT File/Directory/Key description](pictures/030000E7.png). ### Viewing the Logical File Contents. **`TFile`** is a descendent of **`TDirectory`**, which means it behaves; like a **`TDirectory`**. We can list the contents, print the name, and; create subdirectories. In a ROOT session, you are always in a directory; and the directory you are in is called the current directory and is; stored in the global variable ***`gDirectory`***. Let us look at a more; detailed example of a ROOT file and its role as the current directory.; First, we create a ROOT file by executing a sample script. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .x $ROOTSYS/tutorials/hsimple.C; ```. Now you should have `hsimple.root` in your directory. The file was; closed by the script so we have to open it again to work with it. We; open the file with the intent to update it, and list its contents. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile f (""hsimple.root"",""UPDATE""); root[] f.ls(); TFile** hsimple.root; TFile* hsimple.root; KEY: TH1F hpx;1 This is the px distribution; KEY: TH2F hpxpy;1 py vs px; KEY: TProfile hprof;1 Profile of pz versus px; KEY: TNtuple ntuple;1 Demo ntuple; ```. It shows the two lines starting with **`TFile`** followed by four lines; starting with the word ""`KEY`"". The four keys tell us that there are; four objects on disk in this file. The syntax of the listing is:. ``` {.cpp}; KEY: <class> <variable>;<cycle number> <title>; ```. For example, the first line in the list means there is an object in the; file on disk, called `hpx`. It is of the class **`TH1F`**; (one-dimensional histogram of floating numbers). The object's title is; ""This is the `px` distribution"". If the line starts with `OBJ`, the; object is in memory.

In a binned likelihood fit, it is possible to skip the PDF normalization when; the unnormalized binned PDF can be interpreted directly in terms of event; yields. This is now done by default for HistFactory models, which; results in great speedups for binned fits with many channels. Some RooFit users; like ATLAS were already using this for a long time. To disable this optimization when using the `hist2workspace` executable, add the `-disable_binned_fit_optimization` command line argument.; Directly in C++, you can also set the `binnedFitOptimization` to `false` in the; HistFactory configuration as follows:; ```C++; RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(measurement, {.binnedFitOptimization=false});; ```; If your compiler doesn't support aggregate initialization with designators, you; need to create and edit the configuration struct explicitely:; ```C++; RooStats::HistFactory::HistoToWorkspaceFactoryFast::Configuration hfCfg;; hfCfg.binnedFitOptimization = false;; RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(measurement, hfCfg);; ```. ### Disable copy assignment for RooAbsArg and derived types. Copy assignment for RooAbsArgs was implemented in an unexpected and; inconsistent way. While one would expect that the copy assignment is copying; the object, it said in the documentation of `RooAbsArg::operator=` that it will; ""assign all boolean and string properties of the original bject. Transient; properties and client-server links are not assigned.""

Users are encouraged to file bug reports; (for any version of the analyzer) where they encounter false positives or other; issues.; set-xcode-analyzer; Starting with analyzer build checker-234, analyzer builds contain a command; line utility called set-xcode-analyzer that allows users to change what; copy of clang that Xcode uses for analysis:. $ set-xcode-analyzer -h; Usage: set-xcode-analyzer [options]. Options:; -h, --help show this help message and exit; --use-checker-build=PATH; Use the Clang located at the provided absolute path,; e.g. /Users/foo/checker-1; --use-xcode-clang Use the Clang bundled with Xcode. Operationally, set-xcode-analyzer edits Xcode's configuration files; to point it to use the version of clang you specify for static; analysis. Within this model it provides you two basic modes:. --use-xcode-clang: Switch Xcode (back) to using the clang that came bundled with it for static analysis.; --use-checker-build: Switch Xcode to using the clang provided by the specified analyzer build. Things to keep in mind. You should quit Xcode prior to running set-xcode-analyzer. You will need to run set-xcode-analyzer under; sudo in order to have write privileges to modify the Xcode; configuration files. Examples; Example 1: Telling Xcode to use checker-235:. $ pwd; /tmp; $ tar xjf checker-235.tar.bz2; $ sudo checker-235/set-xcode-analyzer --use-checker-build=/tmp/checker-235. Note that you typically won't install an analyzer build in /tmp, but; the point of this example is that set-xcode-analyzer just wants a full; path to an untarred analyzer build.; Example 2: Telling Xcode to use a very specific version of clang:. $ sudo set-xcode-analyzer --use-checker-build=~/mycrazyclangbuild/bin/clang.

First, all tests are executed within the LLVM object directory tree.; They *are not* executed inside of the LLVM source tree. This is because; the test suite creates temporary files during execution. To run the test suite, you need to use the following steps:. #. Check out the ``test-suite`` module with:. .. code-block:: bash. % git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git test-suite. #. FIXME: these directions are outdated and won't work. Figure out; what the correct thing to do is, and write it down here. #. Configure and build ``llvm``. #. Configure and build ``llvm-gcc``. #. Install ``llvm-gcc`` somewhere. #. *Re-configure* ``llvm`` from the top level of each build tree (LLVM; object directory tree) in which you want to run the test suite, just; as you do before building LLVM. During the *re-configuration*, you must either: (1) have ``llvm-gcc``; you just built in your path, or (2) specify the directory where your; just-built ``llvm-gcc`` is installed using; ``--with-llvmgccdir=$LLVM_GCC_DIR``. You must also tell the configure machinery that the test suite is; available so it can be configured for your build tree:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd $LLVM_OBJ_ROOT ; $LLVM_SRC_ROOT/configure [--with-llvmgccdir=$LLVM_GCC_DIR]. [Remember that ``$LLVM_GCC_DIR`` is the directory where you; *installed* llvm-gcc, not its src or obj directory.]. #. You can now run the test suite from your build tree as follows:. .. code-block:: bash. % cd $LLVM_OBJ_ROOT/projects/test-suite; % make. Note that the second and third steps only need to be done once. After; you have the suite checked out and configured, you don't need to do it; again (unless the test code or configure script changes). Configuring External Tests; ==========================. In order to run the External tests in the ``test-suite`` module, you; must specify *--with-externals*.

The default compression algorithm used when writing ROOT files has been updated to use LZ4 in particular to improve read (decompression) performance. You can change this default for each file through (for example) the `TFile constructor` or `TFile::SetCompressionAlgorithm`. It should be noted that ROOT files written with LZ4 compression can not be read with older release of ROOT. Support for LZ4 was however back-ported to the patch branches of previous releases and the following tags (and later release in the same patch series) can read ROOT files written with LZ4 compression:. * v5.34/38; * v6.08/06 [not yet released]; * v6.10/08; * v6.12/02. ## Removed interfaces. ## Core Libraries; - Optimize away redundant deserialization of template specializations.

In order to use these features, the user must link the right runtime libraries; into their program. These libraries are distributed alongside Clang in the; library resource directory. Clang searches for the resource directory by; searching relative to the Clang executable. For example, if LLVM is installed; in ``C:\Program Files\LLVM``, then the profile runtime library will be located; at the path; ``C:\Program Files\LLVM\lib\clang\11.0.0\lib\windows\clang_rt.profile-x86_64.lib``. For UBSan, PGO, and coverage, Clang will emit object files that auto-link the; appropriate runtime library, but the user generally needs to help the linker; (whether it is ``lld-link.exe`` or MSVC ``link.exe``) find the library resource; directory. Using the example installation above, this would mean passing; ``/LIBPATH:C:\Program Files\LLVM\lib\clang\11.0.0\lib\windows`` to the linker.; If the user links the program with the ``clang`` or ``clang-cl`` drivers, the; driver will pass this flag for them. If the linker cannot find the appropriate library, it will emit an error like; this::. $ clang-cl -c -fsanitize=undefined t.cpp. $ lld-link t.obj -dll; lld-link: error: could not open 'clang_rt.ubsan_standalone-x86_64.lib': no such file or directory; lld-link: error: could not open 'clang_rt.ubsan_standalone_cxx-x86_64.lib': no such file or directory. $ link t.obj -dll -nologo; LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'clang_rt.ubsan_standalone-x86_64.lib'. To fix the error, add the appropriate ``/libpath:`` flag to the link line. For ASan, as of this writing, the user is also responsible for linking against; the correct ASan libraries. If the user is using the dynamic CRT (``/MD``), then they should add; ``clang_rt.asan_dynamic-x86_64.lib`` to the link line as a regular input.

There are many planned; enhancements to improve both the precision and scope of its analysis algorithms; as well as the kinds of bugs it will find. While there are fundamental; limitations to what static analysis can do, we have a long way to go before; hitting that wall.; Slower than Compilation; Operationally, using static analysis to; automatically find deep program bugs is about trading CPU time for the hardening; of code. Because of the deep analysis performed by state-of-the-art static; analysis tools, static analysis can be much slower than compilation.; While the Clang Static Analyzer is being designed to be as fast and; light-weight as possible, please do not expect it to be as fast as compiling a; program (even with optimizations enabled). Some of the algorithms needed to find; bugs require in the worst case exponential time.; The Clang Static Analyzer runs in a reasonable amount of time by both; bounding the amount of checking work it will do as well as using clever; algorithms to reduce the amount of work it must do to find bugs.; False Positives; Static analysis is not perfect. It can falsely flag bugs in a program where; the code behaves correctly. Because some code checks require more analysis; precision than others, the frequency of false positives can vary widely between; different checks. Our long-term goal is to have the analyzer have a low false; positive rate for most code on all checks.; Please help us in this endeavor by reporting false; positives. False positives cannot be addressed unless we know about; them.; More Checks; Static analysis is not magic; a static analyzer can only find bugs that it; has been specifically engineered to find.

If a community member expresses a concern about a recent commit, and this; concern would have been significant enough to warrant a conversation during; pre-commit review (including around the need for more design discussions),; they may ask for a revert to the original author who is responsible to revert; the patch promptly. Developers often disagree, and erring on the side of the; developer asking for more review prevents any lingering disagreement over; code in the tree. This does not indicate any fault from the patch author,; this is inherent to our post-commit review practices.; Reverting a patch ensures that design discussions can happen without blocking; other development; it's entirely possible the patch will end up being reapplied; essentially as-is once concerns have been resolved.

One option you may really; want to change, regardless of anything else, might be the; ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` setting to select a directory to INSTALL to; once compiling is complete, although installation is not mandatory for; using LLVM. Another important option is ``LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD``,; which controls the LLVM target architectures that are included on the; build.; * CMake generates project files for all build types. To select a specific; build type, use the Configuration manager from the VS IDE or the; ``/property:Configuration`` command line option when using MSBuild.; * By default, the Visual Studio project files generated by CMake use the; 32-bit toolset. If you are developing on a 64-bit version of Windows and; want to use the 64-bit toolset, pass the ``-Thost=x64`` flag when; generating the Visual Studio solution. This requires CMake 3.8.0 or later. 13. Start Visual Studio and select configuration:. In the directory you created the project files will have an ``llvm.sln``; file, just double-click on that to open Visual Studio. The default Visual; Studio configuration is **Debug** which is slow and generates a huge amount; of debug information on disk.

The parameter value is the update interval in milliseconds. ### JSON file-based monitoring. Solid file-based monitoring (without integration of THttpServer into application) can be; implemented in JSON format. There is the [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTBufferJSON.html) class,; which is capable to convert any (beside TTree) ROOT object into JSON.

Deployability,"en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork>`_.; As GitHub uses the first line of the commit message truncated to 72 characters; as the pull request title, you may have to edit to reword or to undo this; truncation. Creating Pull Requests with GitHub CLI; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; With the CLI it's enough to create the branch locally and then run:. ::. gh pr create. When prompted select to create and use your own fork and follow; the instructions to add more information needed. .. note::. When you let the GitHub CLI create a fork of llvm-project to; your user, it will change the git ""remotes"" so that ""origin"" points; to your fork and ""upstream"" points to the main llvm-project repository. Updating Pull Requests; ----------------------; In order to update your pull request, the only thing you need to do is to push; your new commits to the branch in your fork. That will automatically update; the pull request. When updating a pull request, you should push additional ""fix up"" commits to; your branch instead of force pushing. This makes it easier for GitHub to; track the context of previous review comments. Consider using the; `built-in support for fixups <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---fixupamendrewordltcommitgt>`_; in git. If you do this, you must squash and merge before landing the PR and; you must use the pull request title and description as the commit message.; You can do this manually with an interactive git rebase or with GitHub's; built-in tool. See the section about landing your fix below. When pushing to your branch, make sure you push to the correct fork. Check your; remotes with:. ::. git remote -v. And make sure you push to the remote that's pointing to your fork.

Deployability,"enerated, the path ""caches out"" and we simply reuse the; existing node. Thus the ExplodedGraph is not a DAG; it can contain; cycles as paths loop back onto each other and cache out. ProgramState and ExplodedNodes are basically immutable once created. Once; one creates a ProgramState, you need to create a new one to get a new; ProgramState. This immutability is key since the ExplodedGraph represents; the behavior of the analyzed program from the entry point. To; represent these efficiently, we use functional data structures (e.g.,; ImmutableMaps) which share data between instances. Finally, individual Checkers work by also manipulating the analysis; state. The analyzer engine talks to them via a visitor interface.; For example, the PreVisitCallExpr() method is called by ExprEngine; to tell the Checker that we are about to analyze a CallExpr, and the; checker is asked to check for any preconditions that might not be; satisfied. The checker can do nothing, or it can generate a new; ProgramState and ExplodedNode which contains updated checker state. If it; finds a bug, it can tell the BugReporter object about the bug,; providing it an ExplodedNode which is the last node in the path that; triggered the problem. = Notes about C++ =. Since now constructors are seen before the variable that is constructed; in the CFG, we create a temporary object as the destination region that; is constructed into. See ExprEngine::VisitCXXConstructExpr(). In ExprEngine::processCallExit(), we always bind the object region to the; evaluated CXXConstructExpr. Then in VisitDeclStmt(), we compute the; corresponding lazy compound value if the variable is not a reference, and; bind the variable region to the lazy compound value. If the variable; is a reference, just use the object region as the initializer value. Before entering a C++ method (or ctor/dtor), the 'this' region is bound; to the object region. In ctors, we synthesize 'this' region with; CXXRecordDecl*, which means we do not use type q",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/README.txt:3573,update,updated,3573,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/README.txt,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/lib/StaticAnalyzer/README.txt,1,['update'],['updated']

This is the top level directory of the LLVM source tree. ``OBJ_ROOT``. This is the top level directory of the LLVM object tree (i.e. the tree where; object files and compiled programs will be placed. It can be the same as; SRC_ROOT). Unpacking the LLVM Archives; ---------------------------. If you have the LLVM distribution, you will need to unpack it before you can; begin to compile it. LLVM is distributed as a number of different; subprojects. Each one has its own download which is a TAR archive that is; compressed with the gzip program.

Deployability,"ent contains the LLVM Developer Policy which defines the project's; policy towards developers and their contributions. The intent of this policy is; to eliminate miscommunication, rework, and confusion that might arise from the; distributed nature of LLVM's development. By stating the policy in clear terms,; we hope each developer can know ahead of time what to expect when making LLVM; contributions. This policy covers all llvm.org subprojects, including Clang,; LLDB, libc++, etc. This policy is also designed to accomplish the following objectives:. #. Attract both users and developers to the LLVM project. #. Make life as simple and easy for contributors as possible. #. Keep the top of tree as stable as possible. #. Establish awareness of the project's :ref:`copyright, license, and patent; policies <copyright-license-patents>` with contributors to the project. This policy is aimed at frequent contributors to LLVM. People interested in; contributing one-off patches can do so in an informal way by sending them to the; `llvm-commits mailing list; <http://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/llvm-commits>`_ and engaging another; developer to see it through the process. Developer Policies; ==================. This section contains policies that pertain to frequent LLVM developers. We; always welcome `one-off patches`_ from people who do not routinely contribute to; LLVM, but we expect more from frequent contributors to keep the system as; efficient as possible for everyone. Frequent LLVM contributors are expected to; meet the following requirements in order for LLVM to maintain a high standard of; quality. Stay Informed; -------------. Developers should stay informed by reading the `LLVM Discourse forums`_ and subscribing; to the categories of interest for notifications. Paying attention to changes being made by others is a good way to see what other people; are interested in and watching the flow of the project as a whole. Contibutions to the project are made through :ref:`Gi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst:1102,patch,patches,1102,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,1,['patch'],['patches']
Deployability,"ent is a wrapper around commands sent; to the remote host by means of PROOF on Demand's `pod-remote`. The VAF; client takes care of setting up passwordless SSH from your client node; to the VAF master. ### Getting the credentials. > You can skip this paragraph if the remote server wasn't configured for; > HTTPS+SSH authentication. In our example we will assume that the remote server's name is; `cloud-gw-213.to.infn.it`: substitute it with your remote endpoint. First, check that you have your Grid certificate and private key; installed both in your browser and in the home directory of your; client. Point your browser to `https://cloud-gw-213.to.infn.it/auth/`: you'll; probably be asked for a certificate to choose for authentication. Pick; one and you'll be presented with the following web page:. ![Web authentication with sshcertauth](img/sshcertauth-web.png). The webpage clearly explains you what to do next. ### Customizing user's configuration. Before entering the VAF environment, you should customize the user's; configuration. How to do so depends on your experiment, but usually you; should essentially specify the version of the experiment's software you; need. For instance, in the CMS use case, only one file is needed:; `~/.vaf/common.before`, which contains something like:. ``` {.bash}; # Version of CMSSW (as reported by ""scram list""); export VafCmsswVersion='CMSSW_5_3_9_sherpa2beta2'; ```. ### Entering the VAF environment. Open a terminal on your client machine (can be either your local; computer or a remote user interface) and type:. vaf-enter <username>@cloud-gw-213.to.infn.it. You'll substitute `<username>` with the username that either your system; administrator or the web authentication (if you used it) provided you.

Deployability,"ent stack; maps and patch points: ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` and; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``. Both kinds of intrinsics generate a; stack map record, and they both allow some form of code patching. They; can be used independently (i.e. ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``; implicitly generates a stack map without the need for an additional; call to ``llvm.experimental.stackmap``). The choice of which to use; depends on whether it is necessary to reserve space for code patching; and whether any of the intrinsic arguments should be lowered according; to calling conventions. ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` does not; reserve any space, nor does it expect any call arguments. If the; runtime patches code at the stack map's address, it will destructively; overwrite the program text. This is unlike; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``, which reserves space for in-place; patching without overwriting surrounding code. The; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint`` intrinsic also lowers a specified; number of arguments according to its calling convention. This allows; patched code to make in-place function calls without marshaling. Each instance of one of these intrinsics generates a stack map record; in the :ref:`stackmap-section`.

This first puts the predicate state into the high bits of `%rsp` before calling; the function and then reads it back out of high bits of `%rsp` afterward. When; correctly executing (speculatively or not), these are all no-ops. When; misspeculating, the stack pointer will end up negative. We arrange for it to; remain a canonical address, but otherwise leave the low bits alone to allow; stack adjustments to proceed normally without disrupting this. Within the; called function, we can extract this predicate state and then reset it on; return:; ```; other_function:; # prolog; callq other_function; movq %rsp, %rax; sarq 63, %rax # Sign extend the high bit to all bits.; # ... .LBB0_N:; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; shlq $47, %rax; orq %rax, %rsp; retq; ```. This approach is effective when all code is mitigated in this fashion, and can; even survive very limited reaches into unmitigated code (the state will; round-trip in and back out of an unmitigated function, it just won't be; updated). But it does have some limitations. There is a cost to merging the; state into `%rsp` and it doesn't insulate mitigated code from misspeculation in; an unmitigated caller. There is also an advantage to using this form of interprocedural mitigation: by; forming these invalid stack pointer addresses we can prevent speculative; returns from successfully reading speculatively written values to the actual; stack. This works first by forming a data-dependency between computing the; address of the return address on the stack and our predicate state. And even; when satisfied, if a misprediction causes the state to be poisoned the; resulting stack pointer will be invalid. ##### Rewrite A",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:39928,update,update,39928,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['update'],['update']

If needed, you can enable trigraphs by passing; ``-ftrigraphs``. Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release; -------------------------------------------------. * Clang now has a ``__builtin_vectorelements()`` function that determines the number of elements in a vector.; For fixed-sized vectors, e.g., defined via ``__attribute__((vector_size(N)))`` or ARM NEON's vector types; (e.g., ``uint16x8_t``), this returns the constant number of elements at compile-time.; For scalable vectors, e.g., SVE or RISC-V V, the number of elements is not known at compile-time and is; determined at runtime.; * The ``__datasizeof`` keyword has been added. It is similar to ``sizeof``; except that it returns the size of a type ignoring tail padding.; * ``__builtin_classify_type()`` now classifies ``_BitInt`` values as the return value ``18``; and vector types as return value ``19``, to match GCC 14's behavior.; * The default value of `_MSC_VER` was raised from 1920 to 1933.; * Since MSVC 19.33 added undocumented attribute ``[[msvc::constexpr]]``, this release adds the attribute as well. * Added ``#pragma clang fp re",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst:13949,release,release,13949,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.rst,1,['release'],['release']

PyPy 5.7 and 5.8 have a built-in module ``cppyy``.; You can still install the cppyy package, but the built-in module takes; precedence.; To use cppyy, first import a compatibility module::. $ pypy; [PyPy 5.8.0 with GCC 5.4.0] on linux2; >>>> import cppyy_compat, cppyy; >>>>. You may have to set ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` appropriately if you get an; ``EnvironmentError`` (it will indicate the needed directory). Note that your python interpreter (whether CPython or ``pypy-c``) may not have; been linked by the C++ compiler.; This can lead to problems during loading of C++ libraries and program shutdown.; In that case, re-linking is highly recommended. Very old versions of PyPy (5.6.0 and earlier) have a built-in ``cppyy`` based; on `Reflex`_, which is less feature-rich and no longer supported.; However, both the :doc:`distribution utilities <utilities>` and user-facing; Python codes are very backwards compatible, making migration straightforward.

The; binaries compiled with no debug information range from \~35 MB to \~45; MB depending on the target platform. The installation and building of ROOT is described in Appendix A:; Install and Build ROOT. You can download the binaries, or the source.; The GNU g++ compiler on most UNIX platforms can compile ROOT.

To address such use cases, lit configuration files support; ``config.recursiveExpansionLimit``, which can be set to a non-negative integer; to specify the maximum number of passes through the substitution list. Thus, in; the above example, setting the limit to 2 would cause lit to make a second pass; that expands ``%{inner}`` in the ``RUN:`` line, and the output from the ``echo``; command when then be:. .. code-block:: shell. expanded. To improve performance, lit will stop making passes when it notices the ``RUN:``; line has stopped changing. In the above example, setting the limit higher than; 2 is thus harmless. To facilitate debugging, after reaching the limit, lit will make one extra pass; and report an error if the ``RUN:`` line changes again. In the above example,; setting the limit to 1 will thus cause lit to report an error instead of; producing incorrect output. Options; -------. The llvm lit configuration allows to customize some things with user options:. ``llc``, ``opt``, ...; Substitute the respective llvm tool name with a custom command line.

The function SelectionDAGBuilder::visitConstrainedFPIntrinsic builds DAG nodes; using mappings specified in ConstrainedOps.def. If however this default build is; not sufficient, the build can be modified, see how it is implemented for; STRICT_FP_ROUND. The new STRICT node will eventually be converted; to the matching non-STRICT node. For this reason it should have the same; operands and values as the non-STRICT version but should also use the chain.; This makes subsequent sharing of code for STRICT and non-STRICT code paths; easier::. lib/CodeGen/SelectionDAG/SelectionDAGBuilder.cpp. Most of the STRICT nodes get legalized the same as their matching non-STRICT; counterparts. A new STRICT node with this property must get added to the; switch in SelectionDAGLegalize::LegalizeOp().::. lib/CodeGen/SelectionDAG/LegalizeDAG.cpp. Other parts of the legalizer may need to be updated as well. Look for; places where the non-STRICT counterpart is legalized and update as needed.; Be careful of the chain since STRICT nodes use it but their counterparts; often don't. The code to do the conversion or mutation of the STRICT node to a non-STRICT; version of the node happens in SelectionDAG::mutateStrictFPToFP(). In most cases; the function can do the conversion using information from ConstrainedOps.def. Be; careful updating this function since some nodes have the same return type; as their input operand, but some are different. Both of these cases must; be properly handled::. lib/CodeGen/SelectionDAG/SelectionDAG.cpp. Whether the mutation may happens or not, depends on how the new node has been; registered in TargetLoweringBase::initActions(). By default all strict nodes are; registered with Expand action::. lib/CodeGen/TargetLoweringBase.cpp. To make debug logs readable it is helpful to update the SelectionDAG's; debug logger:::. lib/CodeGen/Selectio",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AddingConstrainedIntrinsics.rst:2051,update,updated,2051,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AddingConstrainedIntrinsics.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/AddingConstrainedIntrinsics.rst,1,['update'],['updated']

For operations that do **not** have native; support, add a callback to the constructor for the ``XXXTargetLowering`` class,; so the instruction selection process knows what to do. The ``TargetLowering``; class callback methods (declared in ``llvm/Target/TargetLowering.h``) are:. * ``setOperationAction`` --- General operation.; * ``setLoadExtAction`` --- Load with extension.; * ``setTruncStoreAction`` --- Truncating store.; * ``setIndexedLoadAction`` --- Indexed load.; * ``setIndexedStoreAction`` --- Indexed store.; * ``setConvertAction`` --- Type conversion.; * ``setCondCodeAction`` --- Support for a given condition code. Note: on older releases, ``setLoadXAction`` is used instead of; ``setLoadExtAction``. Also, on older releases, ``setCondCodeAction`` may not; be supported. Examine your release to see what methods are specifically; supported. These callbacks are used to determine that an operation does or does not work; with a specified type (or types). And in all cases, the third parameter is a; ``LegalAction`` type enum value: ``Promote``, ``Expand``, ``Custom``, or; ``Legal``. ``SparcISelLowering.cpp`` contains examples of all four; ``LegalAction`` values. Promote; ^^^^^^^. For an operation without native support for a given type, the specified type; may be promoted to a larger type that is supported.

It should be assumed that; there are either 0 hash values, or a number equal to the number of type; records in the TPI stream (``TypeIndexEnd - TypeEndBegin``). Thus, if; ``HashBufferLength`` is not equal to ``(TypeIndexEnd - TypeEndBegin) *; HashKeySize`` we can consider the PDB malformed. - **IndexOffsetBufferOffset / IndexOffsetBufferLength** - The offset and size; within the TPI Hash Stream of the Type Index Offsets Buffer. This is a list; of pairs of uint32_t's where the first value is a :ref:`Type Index; <type_indices>` and the second value is the offset in the type record data of; the type with this index.

This appears to; be useful in incremental linking scenarios, so that if a type is modified an; entry can be created mapping the old hash value to the new type index so that; a PDB file consumer can always have the most up to date version of the type; without forcing the incremental linker to garbage collect and update; references that point to the old version to now point to the new version.; The layout of this hash table is described in :doc:`HashTable`. .. _tpi_records:.

This class implements an adaptive quadrature integration method for multi dimensional functions. It is described in this paper; *Genz, A.A. Malik, An adaptive algorithm for numerical integration over an N-dimensional rectangular region, J. Comput. Appl. Math. 6 (1980) 295-302*.; It is part of the *MathCore* library.; The user can control the relative and absolute tolerance and the maximum allowed number of function evaluation. #### `ROOT::Math::GSLMCIntegrator`. It is a class for performing numerical integration of a multidimensional function. It uses the numerical integration algorithms of GSL, which reimplements the algorithms used; in the QUADPACK, a numerical integration package written in Fortran. Plain MC, MISER and VEGAS integration algorithms are supported for integration over finite (hypercubic) ranges.; For a detail description of the GSL methods visit the GSL users guide.; Specific configuration options (documented in the GSL user guide) for the `ROOT::Math::GSLMCIntegration` can be set directly in the class, or when using it via the `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDim`; interface, can be defined using the `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDimOptions`. ## Function Derivation.

The current minimum version of Python required is documented in the :doc:`GettingStarted`; section. Python code in the LLVM repository should only use language features; available in this version of Python. The Python code within the LLVM repository should adhere to the formatting guidelines; outlined in `PEP 8 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>`_. For consistency and to limit churn, code should be automatically formatted with; the `black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ utility, which is PEP 8 compliant.; Use its default rules. For example, avoid specifying ``--line-length`` even; though it does not default to 80. The default rules can change between major; versions of black. In order to avoid unnecessary churn in the formatting rules,; we currently use black version 23.x in LLVM. When contributing a patch unrelated to formatting, you should format only the; Python code that the patch modifies. For this purpose, use the `darker; <https://pypi.org/project/darker/>`_ utility, which runs default black rules; over only the modified Python code. Doing so should ensure the patch will pass; the Python format checks in LLVM's pre-commit CI, which also uses darker. When; contributing a patch specifically for reformatting Python files, use black,; which currently only supports formatting entire files. Here are some quick examples, but see the black and darker documentation for; details:. .. code-block:: bash. $ pip install black=='23.*' darker # install black 23.x and darker; $ darker test.py # format uncommitted changes; $ darker -r HEAD^ test.py # also format changes from last commit; $ black test.py # format entire file.

[FastCGI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCGI) is a protocol for interfacing interactive programs with a web server like `Apache`, `lighttpd`, `Microsoft ISS` and many others. When starting THttpServer, one could specify:. ```cpp; serv = new THttpServer(""fastcgi:9000"");; ```. In fact, the FastCGI interface can run in parallel to http server. One can just call:. ```cpp; serv = new THttpServer(""http:8080"");; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000"");; ```. One could specify a debug parameter to be able to adjust the FastCGI configuration on the web server:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?debug=1"");; ```. By default 10 threads are used to process FastCGI requests. This number can be changed with ""thrds"" url parameter:. ```cpp; serv->CreateEngine(""fastcgi:9000?thrds=20"");; ```. If `thrds=0` parameter specified, the only thread will be use to received and process all requests. All user access will be ruled by the main web server. Authorized account names could be used to configure access restriction in THttpServer. ### Configure fastcgi with Apache2. Since Apache version 2.4 FastCGI is directly supported - there is no need to compile and install external modules any more.; One only need to enable `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_fcgi` modules and add following line to **Apache2** configuration file:. ```; ProxyPass ""/root.app/"" ""fcgi://localhost:9000/"" enablereuse=on; ```. More information can be found in [FastCGI proxy docu](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_fcgi.html).; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md:10521,configurat,configuration,10521,documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

Be aware, that with *lighttpd* one should specify IP address of the host, where ROOT application is running. Address of the ROOT application will be following: `http://lighttpd_host_name/root.app/`. Example of authorization configuration for FastCGI connection:. auth.require = ( ""/root.app"" => (; ""method"" => ""digest"",; ""realm"" => ""root"",; ""require"" => ""valid-user""; ) ). ## Integration with existing applications. In many practical cases no change of existing code is required. Opened files (and all objects inside), existing canvas and histograms are automatically scanned by the server and will be available to the users. If necessary, any object can be registered directly to the server with a [THttpServer::Register()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHttpServer.html#a73658daf379e87a4832fe9dc5c1483ed) call. Central point of integration - when and how THttpServer get access to data from a running application. By default it is done during the `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` call - THttpServer uses a synchronous timer which is activated every 100 ms. Such approach works perfectly when running macros in an interactive ROOT session. If an application runs in compiled code and does not contain `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` calls, two method are available. ### Asynchronous timer. The first method is to configure an asynchronous timer for the server, like for example:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(100, kFALSE);; ```. Then, the timer will be activated even without any gSystem->ProcessEvents() method call. The main advantage of such method is that the application code can be used without any modifications. But there is no control when access to the application data is performed. It could happen just in-between of **`TH1::Fill()`** calls and an histogram object may be incomplete. Therefore such method is not recommended. ### Regular calls of THttpServer::ProcessR",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md:13033,integrat,integration,13033,documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/HttpServer/HttpServer.md,1,['integrat'],['integration']
Deployability,"erver into application) can be; implemented in JSON format. There is the [TBufferJSON](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTBufferJSON.html) class,; which is capable to convert any (beside TTree) ROOT object into JSON. Any ROOT application can use such class to; create JSON files for selected objects and write such files in a directory,; which can be accessed via web server. Then one can use JSROOT to read such files and display objects in a web browser. There is a demonstration page showing such functionality: <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm>.; This demo page reads in cycle 20 json files and displays them. If one has a web server which already provides such JSON file, one could specify the URL to this file like:. <https://root.cern/js/latest/demo/update_draw.htm?addr=../httpserver.C/Canvases/c1/root.json.gz>. Here the same problem with [Cross-Origin Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control) can appear. If the web server configuration cannot be changed, just copy JSROOT to the web server itself. ### Binary file-based monitoring (not recommended). Theoretically, one could use binary ROOT files to implement monitoring.; With such approach, a ROOT-based application creates and regularly updates content of a ROOT file, which can be accessed via normal web server. From the browser side, JSROOT could regularly read the specified objects and update their drawings. But such solution has three major caveats. First of all, one need to store the data of all objects, which only potentially could be displayed in the browser. In case of 10 objects it does not matter, but for 1000 or 100000 objects this will be a major performance penalty. With such big amount of data one will never achieve higher update rate. The second problem is I/O. To read the first object from the ROOT file, one need to perform several (about 5) file-reading operations via http protocol.; There is no http file locking mechanism (at least not for standard web servers),; th",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md:32069,configurat,configuration,32069,documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/JSROOT/JSROOT.md,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

It is the same as the stochastic minimization, but the weights are; updated after considering all the examples, with the total derivative; `dEdw`. The parameters for this method are `Eta`, `EtaDecay`, `Delta`; and `Epsilon`. #### Steepest Descent Algorithm. Weights are set to the minimum along the line defined by the gradient.; The only parameter for this method is `Tau`. Lower `Tau` = higher; precision = slower search. A value `Tau=3` seems reasonable. #### Conjugate Gradients With the Polak-Ribiere Updating Formula. Weights are set to the minimum along the line defined by the conjugate; gradient.

The stack map intrinsic generates no code in place, unless nops are; needed to cover its shadow (see below). However, its offset from; function entry is stored in the stack map. This is the relative; instruction address immediately following the instructions that; precede the stack map. The stack map ID allows a runtime to locate the desired stack map; record. LLVM passes this ID through directly to the stack map; record without checking uniqueness. LLVM guarantees a shadow of instructions following the stack map's; instruction offset during which neither the end of the basic block nor; another call to ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` or; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint`` may occur. This allows the runtime to; patch the code at this point in response to an event triggered from; outside the code. The code for instructions following the stack map; may be emitted in the stack map's shadow, and these instructions may; be overwritten by destructive patching. Without shadow bytes, this; destructive patching could overwrite program text or data outside the; current function. We disallow overlapping stack map shadows so that; the runtime does not need to consider this corner case. For example, a stack map with 8 byte shadow:. .. code-block:: llvm. call void @runtime(); call void (i64, i32, ...) @llvm.experimental.stackmap(i64 77, i32 8,; ptr %ptr); %val = load i64, ptr %ptr; %add = add i64 %val, 3; ret i64 %add.

Now, if the runtime needs to invalidate the compiled code, it may; patch 8 bytes of code at the stack map's address at follows:. .. code-block:: none. 0x00 callq _runtime; 0x05 movl $0xffff, %rax <--- patched code at stack map address; 0x0a callq *",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst:6169,patch,patching,6169,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,1,['patch'],['patching']

Semantics; ---------. There are five :arc-term:`managed operations` which may be performed on an; object of retainable object pointer type.

Deployability,"es to update the headers in the heap; memory, and avoid any type of double-fetching. Randomness; ----------; Randomness is a critical factor to the additional security provided by the; allocator. The allocator trusts the memory mapping primitives of the OS to; provide pages at (mostly) non-predictable locations in memory, as well as the; binaries to be compiled with ASLR. In the event one of those assumptions is; incorrect, the security will be greatly reduced. Scudo further randomizes how; blocks are allocated in the Primary, can randomize how caches are assigned to; threads. Memory reclaiming; -----------------; Primary and Secondary allocators have different behaviors with regard to; reclaiming. While Secondary mapped allocations can be unmapped on deallocation,; it isn't the case for the Primary, which could lead to a steady growth of the; RSS of a process. To counteract this, if the underlying OS allows it, pages; that are covered by contiguous free memory blocks in the Primary can be; released: this generally means they won't count towards the RSS of a process and; be zero filled on subsequent accesses). This is done in the deallocation path,; and several options exist to tune this behavior. Usage; =====. Platform; --------; If using Fuchsia or an Android version greater than 11, your memory allocations; are already service by Scudo (note that Android Svelte configurations still use; jemalloc). Library; -------; The allocator static library can be built from the LLVM tree thanks to the; ``scudo_standalone`` CMake rule. The associated tests can be exercised thanks to; the ``check-scudo_standalone`` CMake rule. Linking the static library to your project can require the use of the; ``whole-archive`` linker flag (or equivalent), depending on your linker.; Additional flags might also be necessary. Your linked binary should now make use of the Scudo allocation and deallocation; functions.

Unlike the stack maps; defined above, the `GCFunctionMetadata` stack map interface does not; provide a way to associate live register values of arbitrary type with; an instruction address, nor does it specify a format for the resulting; stack map. The stack maps described here could potentially provide; richer information to a garbage collecting runtime, but that usage; will not be discussed in this document. Intrinsics; ==========. The following two kinds of intrinsics can be used to implement stack; maps and patch points: ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` and; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``. Both kinds of intrinsics generate a; stack map record, and they both allow some form of code patching. They; can be used independently (i.e. ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``; implicitly generates a stack map without the need for an additional; call to ``llvm.experimental.stackmap``). The choice of which to use; depends on whether it is necessary to reserve space for code patching; and whether any of the intrinsic arguments should be lowered according; to calling conventions. ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` does not; reserve any space, nor does it expect any call arguments. If the; runtime patches code at the stack map's address, it will destructively; overwrite the program text. This is unlike; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint``, which reserves space for in-place; patching without overwriting surrounding code. The; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint`` intrinsic also lowers a specified; number of arguments according to its calling convention. This allows; patched code to make in-place function calls without marshaling. Each instance of one of these intrinsics generates a stack map record; in the :ref:`stackmap-section`. The record includes an ID, allowing; the runtime to uniquely identify the stack ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst:3298,patch,patchpoint,3298,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackMaps.rst,1,['patch'],['patchpoint']

This document discusses the key designs of ``-fbounds-safety``. The document is; subject to be actively updated with a more detailed specification. The; implementation plan can be found in :doc:`BoundsSafetyImplPlans`. Programming Model; =================. Overview; --------. ``-fbounds-safety`` ensures that pointers are not used to access memory beyond; their bounds by performing bounds checking. If a bounds check fails, the program; will deterministically trap before out-of-bounds memory is accessed. In our model, every pointer has an explicit or implicit bounds attribute that; determines its bounds and ensures guaranteed bounds checking. Consider the; example below where the ``__counted_by(count)`` annotation indicates that; parameter ``p`` points to a buffer of integers containing ``count`` elements. An; off-by-one error is present in the loop condition, leading to ``p[i]`` being; out-of-bounds access during the loop's final iteration. The compiler inserts a; bounds check before ``p`` is dereferenced to ensure that the access remains; within the specified bounds. .. code-block:: c. vo",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:2754,update,updated,2754,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"ess. To do so, you can force the painting; with a `TCanvas::Update()`. For example, a **`TGraph`** creates a; histogram (**`TH1`**) to paint itself. In this case the internal; histogram obtained with `TGraph::GetHistogram()` is created only after; the pad is painted. The pad is painted automatically after the script is; finished executing or if you force the painting with `TPad::Modified()`; followed by a `TCanvas::Update()`. Note that it is not necessary to call; `TPad::Modified()` after a call to `Draw()`. The ""bit-modified"" is set; automatically by `Draw()`. A note about the ""bit-modified"" in sub pads:; when you want to update a sub pad in your canvas, you need to call; `pad->Modified()` rather than `canvas->Modified()`, and follow it with a; `canvas->Update()`. If you use `canvas->Modified()`, followed by a call; to `canvas->Update()`, the sub pad has not been declared modified and it; will not be updated. Also note that a call to `pad->Update()` where pad; is a sub pad of canvas, calls `canvas->Update()` and recursively updates; all the pads on the canvas. ### Making a Pad Transparent. As we will see in the paragraph ""Fill Attributes"", a fill style (type of; hatching) may be set for a pad. ``` {.cpp}; root[] pad1->SetFillStyle(istyle); ```. This is done with the `SetFillStyle` method where `istyle` is a style; number, defined in ""Fill Attributes"". A special set of styles allows; handling of various levels of transparency. These are styles number 4000; to 4100, 4000 being fully transparent and 4100 fully opaque. So, suppose; you have an existing canvas with several pads. You create a new pad; (transparent) covering for example the entire canvas. Then you draw your; primitives in this pad. The same can be achieved with the graphics; editor. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] .x tutorials/hist/h1draw.C; root[] TPad *newpad=new TPad(""newpad"",""Transparent pad"",0,0,1,1);; root[] newpad->SetFillStyle(4000);; root[] newpad->Draw();; root[] newpad->cd();; root[] // create",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md:28107,update,updates,28107,documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Graphics.md,1,['update'],['updates']

Deployability,"est/lit.site.cfg.py`` in the build directory.; The ``llvm/test`` Makefile does this work for you. In order for the regression tests to work, each directory of tests must; have a ``lit.local.cfg`` file. :program:`lit` looks for this file to determine; how to run the tests. This file is just Python code and thus is very; flexible, but we've standardized it for the LLVM regression tests. If; you're adding a directory of tests, just copy ``lit.local.cfg`` from; another directory to get running. The standard ``lit.local.cfg`` simply; specifies which files to look in for tests. Any directory that contains; only directories does not need the ``lit.local.cfg`` file. Read the :doc:`Lit; documentation <CommandGuide/lit>` for more information. Each test file must contain lines starting with ""RUN:"" that tell :program:`lit`; how to run it. If there are no RUN lines, :program:`lit` will issue an error; while running a test. RUN lines are specified in the comments of the test program using the; keyword ``RUN`` followed by a colon, and lastly the command (pipeline); to execute. Together, these lines form the ""script"" that :program:`lit`; executes to run the test case. The syntax of the RUN lines is similar to a; shell's syntax for pipelines including I/O redirection and variable; substitution. However, even though these lines may *look* like a shell; script, they are not. RUN lines are interpreted by :program:`lit`.; Consequently, the syntax differs from shell in a few ways. You can specify; as many RUN lines as needed. :program:`lit` performs substitution on each RUN line to replace LLVM tool names; with the full paths to the executable built for each tool (in; ``$(LLVM_OBJ_ROOT)/bin``). This ensures that :program:`lit` does; not invoke any stray LLVM tools in the user's path during testing.

Alternatively the ``install-distribution`` target, which is; recommended for building distributions, only installs specific parts of LLVM as; specified at configuration time by *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS*. Additionally by default the ``install`` target will install the LLVM testing; tools as the public tools. This can be changed well by setting; *LLVM_INSTALL_TOOLCHAIN_ONLY* to ``On``. The LLVM tools are intended for; development and testing of LLVM, and should only be included in distributions; that support LLVM development. When building with *LLVM_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* the build system also; generates a ``distribution`` target which builds all the components specified in; the list. This is a convenience build target to allow building just the; distributed pieces without needing to build all configured targets. .. _Multi-distribution configurations:. Multi-distribution configurations; ---------------------------------. The ``install-distribution`` target described above is for building a single; distribution. LLVM's build system also supports building multiple distributions,; which can be used to e.g. have one distribution containing just tools and; another for libraries (to enable development). These are configured by setting; the *LLVM_DISTRIBUTIONS* variable to hold a list of all distribution names; (which conventionally start with an uppercase letter, e.g. ""Development""), and; then setting the *LLVM_<distribution>_DISTRIBUTION_COMPONENTS* variable to the; list of targets for that distribution. For each distribution, the build system; generates an ``install-${distribution}-distribution`` target, where; ``${distribution}`` is the name of the distribution in lowercase, to install; that distribution. Each distribution creates its own set of CMake exports, and the target to; install the CMake exports for a particular distribution for a project is named; ``${project}-${distribution}-cmake-exports``, where ``${project}`` is the name; of the projec",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst:4272,install,install-distribution,4272,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,1,['install'],['install-distribution']

In a binned likelihood fit, it is possible to skip the PDF normalization when; the unnormalized binned PDF can be interpreted directly in terms of event; yields. This is now done by default for HistFactory models, which; results in great speedups for binned fits with many channels. Some RooFit users; like ATLAS were already using this for a long time. To disable this optimization when using the `hist2workspace` executable, add the `-disable_binned_fit_optimization` command line argument.; Directly in C++, you can also set the `binnedFitOptimization` to `false` in the; HistFactory configuration as follows:; ```C++; RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(measurement, {.binnedFitOptimization=false});; ```; If your compiler doesn't support aggregate initialization with designators, you; need to create and edit the configuration struct explicitely:; ```C++; RooStats::HistFactory::HistoToWorkspaceFactoryFast::Configuration hfCfg;; hfCfg.binnedFitOptimization = false;; RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(measurement, hfCfg);; ```. ### Disable copy assignment for RooAbsArg and derived types.

This contradicted with; the implementation, where the server links were actually copied too.; Furthermore, in `RooAbsRealLValue`, the assigment operator was overloaded by a; function that only assigns the value of another `RooAbsReal`.

C.d.f and running integrals that are calculated from p.d.fs that have; support for analytical integration are constructed from an appropriately reconnected RooRealIntegral.; If numeric integration is required, the c.d.f or running integral is calculated by a dedicated class; RooRunningIntegral that precalculates results for all observable values, which is more efficient; in most use cases. Cumulative distributions functions that are calculated numerically are handled slightly differently; that standard running integrals: their values is constructed to converge to exactly zero at the lower bound; and exactly 1 at the upper bound so that algorithms that make use of that property of c.d.f can do so reliably. Constraints management. New tools have been added to simplify studies with fits involving (external) constraints on parameters.; The general philosophy is that constraints on parameters can be represented as probability density functions; and can thus be modeled by RooAbsPdf classes (e.g. a RooGaussian for a simple Gaussian constraint on a parameter).; There are two modes of operation: you can add",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v520/index.html:5958,integrat,integration,5958,roofit/doc/v520/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v520/index.html,2,['integrat'],['integration']

It refers to; both the location at which the machine state is parsable and the; coordination protocol involved in bring application threads to a; point at which the collector can safely use that information. The; term ""statepoint"" as used in this document refers exclusively to the; former. This document focuses on the last item - compiler support for; safepoints in generated code. We will assume that an outside; mechanism has decided where to place safepoints. From our; perspective, all safepoints will be function calls. To support; relocation of objects directly reachable from values in compiled code,; the collector must be able to:. #. identify every copy of a pointer (including copies introduced by; the compiler itself) at the safepoint,; #. identify which object each pointer relates to, and; #. potentially update each of those copies. This document describes the mechanism by which an LLVM based compiler; can provide this information to a language runtime/collector, and; ensure that all pointers can be read and updated if desired. Abstract Machine Model; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. At a high level, LLVM has been extended to support compiling to an abstract; machine which extends the actual target with a non-integral pointer type; suitable for representing a garbage collected reference to an object. In; particular, such non-integral pointer type have no defined mapping to an; integer representation.

Can Code Be Reviewed After It Is Committed?; -------------------------------------------. Post-commit review is encouraged, and can be accomplished using any of the; tools detailed below. There is a strong expectation that authors respond; promptly to post-commit feedback and address it. Failure to do so is cause for; the patch to be :ref:`reverted <revert_policy>`. If a community member expresses a concern about a recent commit, and this; concern would have been significant enough to warrant a conversation during; pre-commit review (including around the need for more design discussions),; they may ask for a revert to the original author who is responsible to revert; the patch promptly. Developers often disagree, and erring on the side of the; developer asking for more review prevents any lingering disagreement over; code in the tree. This does not indicate any fault from the patch author,; this is inherent to our post-commit review practices.; Reverting a patch ensures that design discussions can happen without blocking; other development; it's entirely possible the patch will end up being reapplied; essentially as-is once concerns have been resolved. Before being recommitted, the patch generally should undergo further review.; The community member who identified the problem is expected to engage; actively in the review.

For example, when; suggesting a change, if you want the author to make a similar set of changes at; other places in the code, please explain the requested set of changes so that; the author can make all of the changes at once.

This allows the patch author and reviewers to make the most efficient; use of their time. LGTM - How a Patch Is Accepted; ------------------------------. A patch is approved to be committed when a reviewer accepts it, and this is; almost always associated with a message containing the text ""LGTM"" (which; stands for Looks Good To Me). Only approval from a single reviewer is required. When providing an unqualified LGTM (approval to commit), it is the; responsibility of the reviewer to have reviewed all of the discussion and; feedback from all reviewers ensuring that all feedback has been addressed and; that all other reviewers will almost surely be satisfied with the patch being; approved. If unsure, the reviewer should provide a qualified approval, (e.g.,; ""LGTM, but please wait for @someone, @someone_else"").

Deployability,"ew algorithmic optimization in the caching of pdfs. So far - in the likelihood - two classes of; objects are identified: those that change with every event (i.e. the pdf) and those that change; only with the parameters (typically pdf normalization integrals). Pdfs are always recalculated; for every event, whereas integrals are only evaluated when needed. The exception to the first type are pdfs; that only depend on constant parameters (or no parameters) - these are identified at the beginning, and precalculated once ; to avoid recalculating an expression with the same outcome for every iteration of the likelihood calculation. For composite pdfs a further optimization has been included: for a M(x,a,b) = f*F(x,a)+(1-f)G(x,b) ; it is e.g. not needed to recalculate G(x,b) if only parameter a has changed w.r.t to the previous likelihood; calculation. This optimization is now implemented by extending the value caching originally designed; for constant terms to be usable for non-constant terms, with a check executed at the beginning of each; likelihood evaluation if selected columns need to be updated because parameters have changed. The speed gain; of this optimization depends much on the structure of the pdf: in models with many free parameters most of the; likelihood evaluations are executed when MINUIT calculates numerical likelihood derivatives which vary ; one parameter at a time and the speedup is potentially larger. In models with few free parameters the; effect will be smaller. The new per-component caching strategy is enabled by default for all pdfs that are a component of; a RooAddPdf or a RooRealSumPdf, unless that component is a RooProdPdf or a RooProduct, in that; case the components of the product are cached instead of the product itself. You can disable this; new optimization by adding Optimize(1) to the RooAbsPdf::fitTo() command line (0 = no caching,; 1 = cache constant terms only, 2 = cache also variable terms according to above mentioned strategy (DEFAUL",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v532/index.html:2784,update,updated,2784,roofit/doc/v532/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v532/index.html,2,['update'],['updated']

Changes that should; change the LLVM Language Reference (e.g., adding new target-independent; intrinsics), adding language extensions in Clang, and so on, require an RFC; (Request for Comment) email on the project's ``*-dev`` mailing list first. For; changes that promise significant impact on users and/or downstream code bases,; reviewers can request an RFC achieving consensus before proceeding with code; review. That having been said, posting initial patches can help with; discussions on an RFC. Code-Review Workflow; ====================. Code review can be an iterative process, which continues until the patch is; ready to be committed. Specifically, once a patch is sent out for review, it; needs an explicit approval before it is committed. Do not assume silent; approval, or solicit objections to a patch with a deadline.

Check if there are files already covering your feature and consider; adding your code there instead of creating a new file. Generating assertions in regression tests; -----------------------------------------. Some regression test cases are very large and complex to write/update by hand.; In that case to reduce the human work we can use the scripts available in; llvm/utils/ to generate the assertions. For example to generate assertions in an :program:`llc`-based test, after; adding one or more RUN lines use:. .. code-block:: bash. % llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc test.ll. This will generate FileCheck assertions, and insert a ``NOTE:`` line at the; top to indicate that assertions were automatically generated. If you want to update assertions in an existing test case, pass the `-u` option; which first checks the ``NOTE:`` line exists and matches the script name. Sometimes a test absolutely depends on hand-written assertions and should not; have assertions automatically generated. In that case, add the text ``NOTE: Do; not autogenerate`` to the first line, and the scripts will skip that test. It; is a good idea to explain why generated assertions will not work for the test; so future developers will understand what is going on. These are the most common scripts and their purposes/applications in generating; assertions:. .. code-block:: none. update_analyze_test_checks.py; opt -passes='print<cost-model>'. update_cc_test_checks.py; C/C++, or clang/clang++ (IR checks). update_llc_test_checks.py; llc (assembly checks). update_mca_test_checks.py; llvm-mca. update_mir_test_checks.py; llc (MIR checks). update_test_checks.py; opt.

To use this intrinsic as a bare-bones stack map, with no code patching; support, the number of shadow bytes can be set to zero. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The stack map intrinsic generates no code in place, unless nops are; needed to cover its shadow (see below). However, its offset from; function entry is stored in the stack map. This is the relative; instruction address immediately following the instructions that; precede the stack map. The stack map ID allows a runtime to locate the desired stack map; record. LLVM passes this ID through directly to the stack map; record without checking uniqueness. LLVM guarantees a shadow of instructions following the stack map's; instruction offset during which neither the end of the basic block nor; another call to ``llvm.experimental.stackmap`` or; ``llvm.experimental.patchpoint`` may occur. This allows the runtime to; patch the code at this point in response to an event triggered from; outside the code. The code for instructions following the stack map; may be emitted in the stack map's shadow, and these instructions may; be overwritten by destructive patching. Without shadow bytes, this; destructive patching could overwrite program text or data outside the; current function. We disallow overlapping stack map shadows so that; the runtime does not need to consider this corner case. For example, a stack map with 8 byte shadow:. .. code-block:: llvm. call void @runtime(); call void (i64, i32, ...) @llvm.experimental.stackmap(i64 77, i32 8,; ptr %ptr); %val = load i64, ptr %ptr; %add = add i64 %val, 3; ret i64 %add.

Deployability,"fault, assumes at; least 1cy between the dispatch event and the issue event. When the performance is limited by data dependencies and/or long latency; instructions, the number of cycles spent while in the *ready* state is expected; to be very small when compared with the total number of cycles spent in the; scheduler's queue. The difference between the two counters is a good indicator; of how large of an impact data dependencies had on the execution of the; instructions. When performance is mostly limited by the lack of hardware; resources, the delta between the two counters is small. However, the number of; cycles spent in the queue tends to be larger (i.e., more than 1-3cy),; especially when compared to other low latency instructions. Bottleneck Analysis; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; The ``-bottleneck-analysis`` command line option enables the analysis of; performance bottlenecks. This analysis is potentially expensive.

They now use `FromSpec` to define multiple samples and `Vary` for systematic variations. ### Distributed RDataFrame. - Vastly improve runtime performance when using an RDataFrame with simulated dataset, i.e. `RDataFrame(nentries)`, by removing usage of `Range` operation to define the per-task entry range. - Explicitly error out when trying to process a TTree with a TTreeIndex in distributed mode. The feature is currently not supported. - JITting the RDataFrame computation graph now only happens once per worker process, not once per task. This greatly reduces memory usage and runtime overhead at of each task. ## TTree Libraries. ## RNTuple; ROOT's experimental successor of TTree has seen a large number of updates during the last few months. Specifically, v6.30 includes the following changes:. - Support for custom ROOT I/O rules that target transient members of a user-defined class (see PR [#11944](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11944)). If a rule only targets transient members and it was working in TTree, it should work unmodified in RNTuple. - Improved support for user-defined classes that behave as a collection. Specifically, RNTuple now relies on the iterator interface defined in `TVirtualCollectionProxy` (see PR [#12380](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12380) for details).; Note that associative collections are not yet supported. - Support for new field types: `std::bitset<N>`, `std::unique_ptr<T>`, `std::set<T>`, `Double32_t`, scoped and unscoped enums with dictionary. - Full support for late model extension, which allows the RNTuple model to be extended after a `RNTupleWriter` has been created from the initial model (see PR [#12376](https",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v630/index.md:6108,update,updates,6108,README/ReleaseNotes/v630/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v630/index.md,1,['update'],['updates']

To enable clang-cl to find system headers, libraries, and the linker when run; from the command-line, it should be executed inside a Visual Studio Native Tools; Command Prompt or a regular Command Prompt where the environment has been set; up using e.g. `vcvarsall.bat <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f2ccy3wt.aspx>`_. clang-cl can also be used from inside Visual Studio by selecting the LLVM; Platform Toolset. The toolset is not part of the installer, but may be installed; separately from the; `Visual Studio Marketplace <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LLVMExtensions.llvm-toolchain>`_.; To use the toolset, select a project in Solution Explorer, open its Property; Page (Alt+F7), and in the ""General"" section of ""Configuration Properties""; change ""Platform Toolset"" to LLVM. Doing so enables an additional Property; Page for selecting the clang-cl executable to use for builds. To use the toolset with MSBuild directly, invoke it with e.g.; ``/p:PlatformToolset=LLVM``. This allows trying out the clang-cl toolchain; without modifying your project files. It's also possible to point MSBuild at clang-cl without changing toolset by; passing ``/p:CLToolPath=c:\llvm\bin /p:CLToolExe=clang-cl.exe``.

The programs define functions that are run multiple times until the; measurement results are statistically significant. - `External/`. Contains descriptions and test data for code that cannot be directly; distributed with the test-suite. The most prominent members of this; directory are the SPEC CPU benchmark suites.; See [External Suites](#external-suites). - `Bitcode/`. These tests are mostly written in LLVM bitcode. - `CTMark/`.

Deployability,"final stage, ROOT might be able to integrate the Name.pcm with the; shared library itself.; * Improved correctness in number of cases -- in a few cases ROOT is more; correct. In particular, when resolving global variables and function; declarations which are not part of the ROOT PCH.; * Enhanced symbol resolution mechanisms, bloom filters -- standard ROOT relies; on information in ROOTMAP files to react when the llvm JIT issues an; unresolved symbol callback. C++ Modules-aware ROOT relies on a behavior much; closer to the standard linker behavior. In particular, we start searching on; the LD_LIBRARY_PATH descending to the system libraries. The algorithm is very; efficient because it uses bloom filters[[5]]. This in turn allows ROOT symbol; to be extended to system libraries. ### Module Registration Approaches. The C++ modules system supports /*preloading*/ of all modules at startup time.; The current implementation of loading of C++ modules in clang has an overhead; and is between 40-60 MB depending on the ROOT configuration while there might; be 2x slowdown depending on the workflow. These issues are very likely to be; addressed by the LLVM community in midterm. Preloading of all C++ modules is semantically the closest to C++ behavior.; However, in order to achieve performance ROOT loads them on demand using; a global module index file. It has sufficient information to map a looked up; identifier to the module which contains the corresponding definition. Switching; back to preloading of all C++ modules is done by setting the `ROOT_USE_GMI`; environment variable to false.; ; ### Supported Platforms. We support all platforms with glibc++ versions: 5.2 onward. We support OSX from XCode 10 onward. ## Changes required by the users; * Self-contained header files -- every header file should be able to compile; on its own.

Deployability,"fixes have been applied to different problems discovered mainly by a test program from Alfio Lazzaro. In detail:; . Fix a bug in MnMinos which was setting wrong initial values when the parameters were limited.; This was resulting in a much larger number of function calls used inside MnMinos. ; Improve MnHesse by returning in the final state the improved gradient step values used in HessianGradientCalculator. With this change same results are obtained from using Hesse in Minuit2 or TMinuit. In addition, the interface of MnHesse (MnHesse::operator() ) has been improved to use it from the FunctionMinimum object (similar to MnMinos) in order to be called after the minimization (Migrad). The API with a MnUserParameterState should not be used after minimization, because in that case the latest state information resulting from the minimum (gradient values and step sizes) is lost. Add support in MnMigrad and MnMinimize for user provided analytical gradient of the FCN function. One needs to pass an instance of a function implementing the ROOT::Minuit2::FcnGradientBase interface. Use now std::string for storing parameter names. This removes the un-necessary limitation on the length of parameter name (10 characters) existing before. The method Name() of MinuitParameter (and of MnUserParameterState and MnUserParameters) still returns a const char * (for backward compatibility). A new method, GetName() has been added to return a std::string. The Minuit2Minimizer class has been improved by having an option to always run Hesse if it was not done before during the minimization. Method to retrieve the correlation coefficients have been also added. More detailed description of the current Minuit2 release can be found at this location. Unuran. A new version, 1.2.4, has been added to fix mainly some problems found in gcc 4.3. For the detailed changes of this new UNU.RAN version see the file $ROOTSYS/math/unuran/src/unuran-1.2.4-root/NEWS.

Nicer plotting: custom variable titles and units can be; assigned in ""AddVariable"" call. Introduced the inverse transformation InverseTransform for; the variable transformations into the framework. While this is; not necessary for classification, it is necessary for; regression. The inverse transformation of the normalization; transformation has been implemented. Started to extend the variable transformations to the; regression targets as well. MethodCuts now produces the 'optimal-cut' histograms needed; by macro mvaeffs.C. (macro 5a of TMVAGui.C); ; MsgLogger can be silenced in order to prevent excess output; during boosting. Third dataset type added centrally (Training, Validation; and Testing). The validation data is split off the original; training data set. Update of GUI and other Macros according to the new; features of PDF and the addition of MethodBoost.; ; Updates in TMVA 4.0.1. ""Spectator"" variables can be defined now which are computed; just as the input variables and which are written out into the; TestTree, but which don't participate in any MVA calculation; (useful for correlation studies).; ; New booking option ""IgnoreNegWeightsInTraining"" to test the; effect of events with negative weights on the training. This is; especially useful for methods, which do not properly deal with; such events. Note that this new option is not available for all; methods (a training interrupt is issued if not available). ; Bug fixes:. Fixed regression bug in VariableNormalizeTransform (Use; number of targets from Event instead of DataSet); ; Fixed Multitarget-Regression in PDEFoam, foam dimensions; were miscalculated. Added writing of targets to the weight files in regression; mode to fix problems in RegressionApplication. Added missing standard C++ header files missing to some; classes, which lead to compilation failures on some; architectures (thanks to Luc",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tmva/doc/v524/index.html:6106,Update,Updates,6106,tmva/doc/v524/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tmva/doc/v524/index.html,1,['Update'],['Updates']

In addition, the %ROOT distribution contains classes; needed to integrate Minuit2 in the %ROOT framework. A new class has been introduced, ROOT::Minuit2::Minuit2Minimizer, which implements; the interface ROOT::Math::Minimizer. Within %ROOT, it can be instantiates also using; the %ROOT plug-in manager. This class provides a convenient entry point for using Minuit2\.; An example of using this interface is the %ROOT tutorial _tutorials/fit/NumericalMinimization.C_; or the Minuit2 test program; [<tt>testMinimize.cxx</tt>](https://github.com/cxx-hep/root-cern/blob/master/math/minuit2/test/testMinimize.cxx). A standalone version of Minuit2 (independent of %ROOT) can be easily built and installed using `CMake`. See this [`README`](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/math/minuit2/README.md) for the instructions on how to get the sources, building and installing a stand-alone Minuit2.

Our RooFoo; example above only contains one integral function (`integralFoo()`). Similar to `doFoo()`, comment out `integralFoo()' in the original file and; move it to 'MathFuncs.h'. As with `doFoo()`. add the relevant inputs (a,b) as parameters, instead of; just class members. ``` {.cpp}; ///// The MathFuncs.h file; int integralFoo(int a, int b) { return /* whatever */;}; ```. > Directory path: [hist/hist/src/MathFuncs.h](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/hist/hist/src/MathFuncs.h).

Deployability,"functions support temporary ranges, for example:. .. code-block:: c++. for (auto [Letter, Count] : zip(SmallVector<char>{'a', 'b', 'c'}, Counts)); errs() << Letter << "": "" << Count << ""\n"";. The difference between the functions in the ``zip`` family is how they behave; when the supplied ranges have different lengths:. * ``zip_equal`` -- requires all input ranges have the same length.; * ``zip`` -- iteration stops when the end of the shortest range is reached.; * ``zip_first`` -- requires the first range is the shortest one.; * ``zip_longest`` -- iteration continues until the end of the longest range is; reached. The non-existent elements of shorter ranges are replaced with; ``std::nullopt``. The length requirements are checked with ``assert``\ s. As a rule of thumb, prefer to use ``zip_equal`` when you expect all; ranges to have the same lengths, and consider alternative ``zip`` functions only; when this is not the case. This is because ``zip_equal`` clearly communicates; this same-length assumption and has the best (release-mode) runtime performance. .. _uf_enumerate:. ``enumerate``; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The ``enumerate`` functions allows to iterate over one or more ranges while; keeping track of the index of the current loop iteration. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. for (auto [Idx, BB, Value] : enumerate(Phi->blocks(),; Phi->incoming_values())); errs() << ""#"" << Idx << "" "" << BB->getName() << "": "" << *Value << ""\n"";. The current element index is provided as the first structured bindings element.; Alternatively, the index and the element value can be obtained with the; ``index()`` and ``value()`` member functions:. .. code-block:: c++. char Letters[26] = ...;; for (auto En : enumerate(Letters)); errs() << ""#"" << En.index() << "" "" << En.value() << ""\n"";.

The BOOTSTRAP\_ prefixes tells CMake to pass the variables on to the instrumented; stage two build. And the CLANG_PGO_TRAINING_DEPS option let's you specify; additional build targets to build before building the external project. The; LLVM Test Suite requires compiler-rt to build, so we need to add the; `runtimes` target as a dependency. After configuration, building the stage2-instrumented-generate-profdata target; will automatically build the stage1 compiler, build the instrumented compiler; with the stage1 compiler, and then run the instrumented compiler against the; perf training data:. .. code-block:: console. $ ninja stage2-instrumented-generate-profdata.

Deployability,"g as the `CMakeCache.txt` file is not removed. Remember that after building a tarball or a binary package you should remove the copied files using:. ```bash; make purge; ```. Otherwise git shows the file as untracked, unless you explicitly remove their tracking yourself with a .gitignore file. ## Building a tarball. Minuit2 standalone also has support for CPack to make installers for different platforms. To build a source package:. ```bash; make package_source; ```. This will create a source file in several formats that you can distribute. Reminder: You **must** have used `-Dminuit2_standalone=ON` when you configured CMake, or many of the files will be missing. ## Building a binary. To build a binary package (add other generators with `-G`):; ```bash; make; make package; ```. ## Maintenance. If new files are needed by Minuit2 due to additions to [ROOT], they should be added to the source files lists in `src/Math/CMakeLists.txt` and `src/Minuit2/CMakeLists.txt` (depending on if it's a new Math or Minuit2 requirement). For testing, the main `test/CMakeLists.txt` is used by ROOT, and the `test/*/CMakeLists.txt` files are used by the standalone build. ## How it works. Extracting from the ROOT sources is made possible through a few careful design features:. * A CMake variable `minuit2_inroot` lets the build system know we are inside ROOT (it looks for `../../build/version_info`); * All files that are not part of the minuit2 directory are passed into `copy_standalone`, and that handles selecting the correct location; * `copy_standalone` copies the files into the minuit2 source directory if `minuit2_standalone` is `ON`. After this happens, all the standard CMake machinery can produce the source distribution. And, CMake correctly builds and installs in either mode, since all source and header files are explicitly listed.

Using libFuzzer as a library; ----------------------------; If the code being fuzzed must provide its own `main`, it's possible to; invoke libFuzzer as a library. Be sure to pass ``-fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link``; during compilation, and link your binary against the no-main version of; libFuzzer. On Linux installations, this is typically located at:. .. code-block:: bash. /usr/lib/<llvm-version>/lib/clang/<clang-version>/lib/linux/libclang_rt.fuzzer_no_main-<architecture>.a. If building libFuzzer from source, this is located at the following path; in the build output directory:. .. code-block:: bash. lib/linux/libclang_rt.fuzzer_no_main-<architecture>.a. From here, the code can do whatever setup it requires, and when it's ready; to start fuzzing, it can call `LLVMFuzzerRunDriver`, passing in the program; arguments and a callback. This callback is invoked just like; `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`, and has the same signature. .. code-block:: c++. extern ""C"" int LLVMFuzzerRunDriver(int *argc, char ***argv,; int (*UserCb)(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size));.

Another important option is ``LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD``,; which controls the LLVM target architectures that are included on the; build.; * CMake generates project files for all build types. To select a specific; build type, use the Configuration manager from the VS IDE or the; ``/property:Configuration`` command line option when using MSBuild.; * By default, the Visual Studio project files generated by CMake use the; 32-bit toolset. If you are developing on a 64-bit version of Windows and; want to use the 64-bit toolset, pass the ``-Thost=x64`` flag when; generating the Visual Studio solution. This requires CMake 3.8.0 or later. 13. Start Visual Studio and select configuration:. In the directory you created the project files will have an ``llvm.sln``; file, just double-click on that to open Visual Studio. The default Visual; Studio configuration is **Debug** which is slow and generates a huge amount; of debug information on disk. For now, we recommend selecting **Release**; configuration for the LLVM project which will build the fastest or; **RelWithDebInfo** which is also several time larger than Release.; Another technique is to build all of LLVM in Release mode and change; compiler flags, disabling optimization and enabling debug information, only; for specific libraries or source files you actually need to debug. 14.

Now we can call the `Loop` method, which will build and display the two; histograms. ``` {.cpp}; root[] m.Loop(); ```. You should now see a canvas that looks like this. ![](pictures/03000106.png). To conclude the discussion on `MakeClass` let us lists the steps that; got us here. - Call `TTree::MakeClass`, which automatically creates a class to loop; over the tree. - Modify the `MyClass::Loop()` method in `MyClass.C` to fit your task. - Load and instantiate `MyClass`, and run `MyClass::Loop()`. ## Using TTree::MakeSelector; \index{tree!MakeSelector}. With a **`TTree`** we can make a selector and use it to process a; limited set of entries. This is especially important in a parallel; processing configuration where the analysis is distributed over several; processors and we can specify which entries to send to each processor.; The `TTree::Process` method is used to specify the selector and the; entries. Before we can use **`TTree::Process`** we need to make a; selector. We can call the `TTree::MakeSelector` method. It creates; two files similar to `TTree::MakeClass`. In the resulting files is a class that is a descendent of; **`TSelector`** and implements the following methods:. - `TSelector::Begin()` `-` this method is called every time a loop; over the tree starts. This is a convenient place to create your; histograms. - `TSelector::Notify()` `-` it is called at the first entry of a new; tree in a chain. - `TSelector::Process()` `-` it is called to process an event. It is; the user's responsibility to read the corresponding entry in memory; (may be just a partial read). Once the entry is in memory one can; apply a selection and if the event is selected histograms can be; filled.

Don't worry, Phabricator; will automatically send a diff with a smaller context in the review; email, but having the full file in the web interface will help the; reviewer understand your code.

Remark streamers; ================. The ``RemarkStreamer`` interface is used to unify the serialization; capabilities of remarks across all the components that can generate remarks. All remark serialization should go through the main remark streamer, the; ``llvm::remarks::RemarkStreamer`` set up in the ``LLVMContext``. The interface; takes remark objects converted to ``llvm::remarks::Remark``, and takes care of; serializing it to the requested format, using the requested type of metadata,; etc. Typically, a specialized remark streamer will hold a reference to the one set; up in the ``LLVMContext``, and will operate on its own type of diagnostics. For example, LLVM IR passes will emit ``llvm::DiagnosticInfoOptimization*``; that get converted to ``llvm::remarks::Remark`` objects. Then, clang could set; up its own specialized remark streamer that takes ``clang::Diagnostic``; objects. This can allow various components of the frontend to emit remarks; using the same techniques as the LLVM remarks. This gives us the following advantages:. * Composition: during the compilation pipeline, multiple components can set up; their specialized remark streamers that all emit remarks through the same; main streamer.; * Re-using the remark infrastructure in ``lib/Remarks``.; * Using the same file and format for the remark emitters created throughout the; compilation. at the cost of an extra layer of abstraction. ..

Deployability,"gned for backwards compatibility then it should be possible to express; compatibility for such architecture versions in the multilib configuration. Not GNU spec files; ------------------. The GNU spec files standard is large and complex and there's little desire to; import that complexity to LLVM. It's also heavily oriented towards processing; command line argument strings which is hard to do correctly, hence the large; amount of logic dedicated to that task in the Clang driver. While compatibility; with GNU would bring benefits, the cost in this case is deemed too high. Avoid re-inventing feature detection in the configuration; ---------------------------------------------------------. A large amount of logic in the Clang driver is dedicated to inferring which; architectural features are available based on the given command line options.; It is neither desirable nor practical to repeat such logic in each multilib; configuration. Instead the configuration should be able to benefit from the; heavy lifting Clang already does to detect features. Low maintenance; ---------------. Multilib is a relatively small feature in the scheme of things so supporting it; should accordingly take little time. Where possible this should be achieved by; implementing it in terms of existing features in the LLVM codebase. Minimal additional API surface; ------------------------------. The greater the API surface, the greater the difficulty of keeping it stable.; Where possible the additional API surface should be kept small by defining it; in relation to existing APIs. An example of this is keeping a simple; relationship between flag names and command line options where possible.; Since the command line options are part of a stable API they are unlikely; to change, and therefore the flag names get the same stability.

Return value (a matrix); from foo() is then copied over to m (via a copy constructor),; and the return value is destroyed. So, the matrix constructor is; called 3 times and the destructor 2 times. For big matrices,; the cost of multiple constructing/copying/destroying of objects; may be very large. *Some* optimized compilers can cut down on 1; copying/destroying, but still it leaves at least two calls to; the constructor. Note, TMatrixDLazy (see below) can construct; TMatrixD m ""inplace"", with only a _single_ call to the; constructor. #### 2. Use ""two-address instructions"". ~~~ {.cpp};",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/matrix/doc/index.md:14698,integrat,integrated,14698,math/matrix/doc/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/matrix/doc/index.md,1,['integrat'],['integrated']

Such regions would save the ``EXEC`` mask,; update it to enable the necessary lanes, perform the operations, and then; restore the ``EXEC`` mask from the saved value. While executing the whole; wavefront region, the conceptual execution mask is the saved value, not the; ``EXEC`` value. This is handled by defining an artificial variable for the active lane mask. The; active lane mask artificial variable would be the actual ``EXEC`` mask for; normal regions, and the saved execution mask for regions where the mask is; temporarily updated.

This case is used by roottest; but should likely not be used by anything but test suites. Instead pass relative paths, together with a `-I` option to find the headers, plus setting `ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH` for finding the; headers back at runtime. The ROOT stress suite is now updated to follow this behavior; see for instance the injection of; `$ROOTSYS/test` in `test/stressMathCore.cxx`, allowing ROOT to find the header at runtime, whether interpreted; (`R__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH`) or compiled (`TROOT::AddExtraInterpreterArgs({""-I...""})` before interpreter construction). If you called `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/subdir/Header1.h LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` then update that; call to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict Header1.h OPTIONS -I subdir LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` *if* the header is usually included as; `#include ""Header1.h""`, or to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY(Dict subdir/Header1.h LINKDEF LinkDef.h)` *if* the header is usually; included as `#include ""subdir/Header1.h""`. I.e. the general rule is: pass to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` (or; `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`) the spelling as `#include`ed. As an important side-effect, `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` and thus `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` now *require* the header to; be found at configuration time. We have seen too many cases where the header location was mis-stated, and as a consequence,; CMake did not generate the proper dependencies. If the header should not be taken into account for dependencies and / or if; the header will not be found (e.g. the standard library's `vector`) please pass the header through the `NODEPHEADERS` option; to `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` or `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE`.

Deployability,"h this approach is that, after hardening, the `%base + (scale *; %index)` subexpression will compute a value near zero (`-1 + (scale * -1)`) and; then a large, positive `offset` will index into memory within the first two; gigabytes of address space. While these offsets are not attacker controlled,; the attacker could chose to attack a load which happens to have the desired; offset and then successfully read memory in that region. This significantly; raises the burden on the attacker and limits the scope of attack but does not; eliminate it. To fully close the attack we must work with the operating system; to preclude mapping memory in the low two gigabytes of address space. ###### 64-bit load checking instructions. We can use the following instruction sequences to check loads. We set up `%r8`; in these examples to hold the special value of `-1` which will be `cmov`ed over; `%rax` in misspeculated paths. Single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```. Two register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the index if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi,%rcx), %edi; ```. This will result in a negative address near zero or in `offset` wrapping the; address space back to a small positive address. Small, negative addresses will; fault in user-mode for most operating systems, but targets which need the high; address space to be user accessible may need to adjust the exact sequence used; above. Additionally, the low addresses will need to be marked unreadable by the; OS to fully harden the load. ###### RIP-relative addressing is even easier to break. There is a common addressing mode idiom that is substantially harder to check:; addressing relative to the instruction pointer.

The ODBC interface, deprecated in ROOT 6.16, is no longer deprecated in ROOT 6.18.; It is the main option to support databases on Windows, so the decision to deprecate; it was reverted. The `xft` option has been merged into `x11` and is no longer used (its value is; now ignored by ROOT). ## Preprocessor deprecation macros; ### Deprecated Classes; * `R__SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE(""Suggestion text"")` macro allows to suggest alternatives to classes.

Deployability,"hat having a; ptrtoint or inttoptr cast (which is common for such use cases) breaks the; rules used for inferring base pointers for arbitrary references when; lowering out of the abstract model to the explicit physical model. Note; that a frontend which lowers directly to the physical model doesn't have; any problems here. Objects on the Stack; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. As noted above, the explicit lowering supports objects allocated on the; stack provided the collector can find a heap map given the stack address. The missing pieces are a) integration with rewriting (RS4GC) from the; abstract machine model and b) support for optionally decomposing on stack; objects so as not to require heap maps for them. The later is required; for ease of integration with some collectors. Lowering Quality and Representation Overhead; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The current statepoint lowering is known to be somewhat poor. In the very; long term, we'd like to integrate statepoints with the register allocator;; in the near term this is unlikely to happen. We've found the quality of; lowering to be relatively unimportant as hot-statepoints are almost always; inliner bugs. Concerns have been raised that the statepoint representation results in a; large amount of IR being produced for some examples and that this; contributes to higher than expected memory usage and compile times.

It means a; liberal, informal development style that heavily relies on the diverse; and deep talent of the user community. The result is that physicists; developed ROOT for themselves; this made it specific, appropriate,; useful, and over time refined and very powerful. The development of; ROOT is a continuous conversation between users and developers with; the line between the two blurring at times and the users becoming; co-developers. When it comes to storing and mining large amount of data, physics; plows the way with its Terabytes, but other fields and industry follow; close behind as they acquiring more and more data over time. They are; ready to use the true and tested technologies physics has invented. In; this way, other fields and industries have found ROOT useful and they; have started to use it also. In the bazaar view, software is released early and frequently to; expose it to thousands of eager co-developers to pound on, report; bugs, and contribute possible fixes. More users find more bugs,; because they stress the program in different ways. By now, after ten; years, the age of ROOT is quite mature.

The algorithm that checks whether two StreamerInfo are equal even-though their; checksum is different has been significantly enhanced in particular to also; check the base classes. ### TFileMerger. - Added possibility to merge only a list of objects/folders from the; input files, specified by name, \; or to skip them from merging. This is fully integrated with the new; PartialMerge(flags) schema. \; Usage: \; The names of the objects to be merged or skipped have to be; specified using the interface:. ``` {.cpp}; TFileMerger::AddObjectNames(const char *names); ```.

Note that you can most of this without actually modifying your project. For; example, if your application targets iPhoneOS 2.2, you could run; scan-build in the following manner from the command line:. $ scan-build xcodebuild -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator2.2. Alternatively, if your application targets iPhoneOS 3.0:. $ scan-build xcodebuild -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator3.0. Gotcha: using the right compiler; Recall that scan-build analyzes your project by using a compiler to; compile the project and clang to analyze your project. The script uses; simple heuristics to determine which compiler should be used (it defaults to; clang on Darwin and gcc on other platforms). When analyzing; iPhone projects, scan-build may pick the wrong compiler than the one; Xcode would use to build your project. For example, this could be because; multiple versions of a compiler may be installed on your system, especially if; you are developing for the iPhone.; When compiling your application to run on the simulator, it is important that scan-build; finds the correct version of gcc/clang. Otherwise, you may see strange build; errors that only happen when you run scan-build. scan-build provides the --use-cc and --use-c++; options to hardwire which compiler scan-build should use for building your code.; Note that although you are chiefly interested in analyzing your project, keep in; mind that running the analyzer is intimately tied to the build, and not being; able to compile your code means it won't get fully analyzed (if at all).; If you aren't certain which compiler Xcode uses to build your project, try; just running xcodebuild (without scan-build). You should see the; full path to the compiler that Xcode is using, and use that as an argument to; --use-cc.

The RNTuple binary format describes the serialized, on-disk representation of an RNTuple data set.; The data on disk is organized in **pages** (typically tens to hundreds of kilobytes in size); and several **envelopes** that contain information about the data such as header and footer.; The RNTuple format specifies the binary layout of the pages and the envelopes. Pages and envelopes are meant to be embedded in a data container; such as a ROOT file or a set of objects in an object store.; Envelopes can reference other envelopes and pages by means of a **locator** or an **envelope link**;; for a file embedding, the locator consists of an offset and a size.; The RNTuple format does _not_ establish a specific order of pages and envelopes.

However, an exception is the normalization of ``-march``.; ``-march`` for Arm architectures contains a list of enabled and disabled; extensions and this list is likely to grow. Therefore ``-march`` flags are; unstable. Incomplete interface; --------------------. The new multilib system does multilib selection based on only a limited set of; command line options, and limits which flags can be used for multilib; selection. This is in order to avoid committing to too large an interface.; Later LLVM versions can add support for multilib selection from more command; line options as needed. Extensible; ----------. It is likely that the configuration format will need to evolve in future to; adapt to new requirements.; Using a format like YAML that supports key-value pairs helps here as it's; trivial to add new keys alongside existing ones. Backwards compatibility; -----------------------. New versions of Clang should be able to use configuration written for earlier; Clang versions.; To avoid behaving in a way that may be subtly incorrect, Clang should be able; to detect if the configuration is too new and emit an error. Forwards compatibility; ----------------------. As an author of a multilib configuration, it should be possible to design the; configuration in such a way that it is likely to work well with future Clang; versions. For example, if a future version of Clang is likely to add support; for newer versions of an architecture and the architecture is known to be; designed for backwards compatibility then it should be possible to express; compatibility for such architecture versions in the multilib configuration.

The ``--build`` option tells ``cmake`` to invoke the underlying build; tool (``make``, ``ninja``, ``xcodebuild``, ``msbuild``, etc.). The underlying build tool can be invoked directly, of course, but; the ``--build`` option is portable. #. After LLVM has finished building, install it from the build directory:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake --build . --target install. The ``--target`` option with ``install`` parameter in addition to; the ``--build`` option tells ``cmake`` to build the ``install`` target. It is possible to set a different install prefix at installation time; by invoking the ``cmake_install.cmake`` script generated in the; build directory:. .. code-block:: console. $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/llvm -P cmake_install.cmake. .. _Basic CMake usage:; .. _Usage:. Basic CMake usage; =================. This section explains basic aspects of CMake; which you may need in your day-to-day usage. CMake comes with extensive documentation, in the form of html files, and as; online help accessible via the ``cmake`` executable itself. Execute ``cmake; --help`` for further help options. CMake allows you to specify a build tool (e.g., GNU make, Visual Studio,; or Xcode). If not specified on the command line, CMake tries to guess which; build tool to use, based on your environment. Once it has identified your; build tool, CMake uses the ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CMake.rst:3351,install,install,3351,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CMake.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CMake.rst,1,['install'],['install']
