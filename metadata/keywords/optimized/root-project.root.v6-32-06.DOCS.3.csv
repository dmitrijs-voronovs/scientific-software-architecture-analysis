Some classes require resource acquisition or other complex initialization that; can fail during construction. Unfortunately constructors can't return errors,; and having clients test objects after they're constructed to ensure that they're; valid is error prone as it's all too easy to forget the test. To work around; this, use the named constructor idiom and return an ``Expected<T>``:. .. code-block:: c++. class Foo {; public:. static Expected<Foo> Create(Resource R1, Resource R2) {; Error Err = Error::success();; Foo F(R1, R2, Err);; if (Err); return std::move(Err);; return std::move(F);; }. private:. Foo(Resource R1, Resource R2, Error &Err) {; ErrorAsOutParameter EAO(&Err);; if (auto Err2 = R1.acquire()) {; Err = std::move(Err2);; return;; }; Err = R2.acquire();; }; };. Here, the named constructor passes an ``Error`` by reference into the actual; constructor, which the constructor can then use to return errors. The; ``ErrorAsOutParameter`` utility sets the ``Error`` value's checked flag on entry; to the constructor so that the error can be assigned to, then resets it on exit; to force the client (the named constructor) to check the error. By using this idiom, clients attempting to construct a Foo receive either a; well-formed Foo or an Error, never an object in an invalid state. Propagating and consuming errors based on types; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". In some contexts, certain types of error are known to be benign. For example,; when walking an archive, some clients may be happy to skip over badly formatted; object files rather than terminating the walk immediately. Skipping badly; formatted objects could be achieved using an elaborate handler method, but the; Error.h header provides two utilities that make this idiom much cleaner: the; type inspection method, ``isA``, and the ``consumeError`` fun",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:34381,error,errors,34381,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['error'],['errors']

Consider baseline x86 instructions like the following, which test three; conditions and if all pass, loads data from memory and potentially leaks it; through some side channel:; ```; # %bb.0: # %entry; pushq %rax; testl %edi, %edi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.1: # %then1; testl %esi, %esi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.2: # %then2; testl %edx, %edx; je .LBB0_3; .LBB0_4: # %exit; popq %rax; retq; .LBB0_3: # %danger; movl (%rcx), %edi; callq leak; popq %rax; retq; ```. When we go to speculatively execute the load, we want to know whether any of; the dynamically executed predicates have been misspeculated. To track that,; along each conditional edge, we need to track the data which would allow that; edge to be taken. On x86, this data is stored in the flags register used by the; conditional jump instruction. Along both edges after this fork in control flow,; the flags register remains alive and contains data that we can use to build up; our accumulated predicate state. We accumulate it using the x86 conditional; move instruction which also reads the flag registers where the state resides.; These conditional move instructions are known to not be predicted on any x86; processors, making them immune to misprediction that could reintroduce the; vulnerability. When we insert the conditional moves, the code ends up looking; like the following:; ```; # %bb.0: # %entry; pushq %rax; xorl %eax, %eax # Zero out initial predicate state.; movq $-1, %r8 # Put all-ones mask into a register.; testl %edi, %edi; jne .LBB0_1; # %bb.2: # %then1; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; testl %esi, %esi; jne .LBB0_1; # %bb.3: # %then2; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; testl %edx, %edx; je .LBB0_4; .LBB0_1:; cmoveq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; popq %rax; retq; .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:15980,alive,alive,15980,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['alive'],['alive']
Availability,"ols for neural; networks studies. ### The MLP. The multilayer perceptron is a simple feed-forward network with the; following structure showed on the left. ![](pictures/0300008D.png). It is made of neurons characterized by a bias and weighted links in; between - let's call those links synapses. The input neurons receive; the inputs, normalize them and forward them to the first hidden layer.; Each neuron in any subsequent layer first computes a linear; combination of the outputs of the previous layer. The output of the; neuron is then function of that combination with f being linear for; output neurons or a sigmoid for hidden layers. Such a structure is very useful because of two theorems:. 1- A linear combination of `sigmoids` can approximate any continuous; function. 2- Trained with `output=1` for the signal and 0 for the background,; the approximated function of inputs `X` is the probability of signal,; knowing `X`. ### Learning Methods. The aim of all learning methods is to minimize the total error on a; set of weighted examples. The error is defined as the sum in quadrate,; divided by two, of the error on each individual output neuron. In all; methods implemented in this library, one needs to compute the first; derivative of that error with respect to the weights. Exploiting the; well-known properties of the derivative, one can express this; derivative as the product of the local partial derivative by the; weighted sum of the outputs derivatives (for a neuron) or as the; product of the input value with the local partial derivative of the; output neuron (for a synapse). This computation is called; ""back-propagation of the errors"". Six learning methods are; implemented. #### Stochastic Minimization. This is the most trivial learning method. The Robbins-Monro stochastic; approximation is applied to multilayer perceptrons.

All of the; LLVM tools that run passes use the PassManager for execution of these passes. The PassManager does two main things to try to reduce the execution time of a; series of passes:. #. **Share analysis results.** The ``PassManager`` attempts to avoid; recomputing analysis results as much as possible. This means keeping track; of which analyses are available already, which analyses get invalidated, and; which analyses are needed to be run for a pass. An important part of work; is that the ``PassManager`` tracks the exact lifetime of all analysis; results, allowing it to :ref:`free memory; <writing-an-llvm-pass-releaseMemory>` allocated to holding analysis results; as soon as they are no longer needed. #. **Pipeline the execution of passes on the program.** The ``PassManager``; attempts to get better cache and memory usage behavior out of a series of; passes by pipelining the passes together. This means that, given a series; of consecutive :ref:`FunctionPass <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>`, it; will execute all of the :ref:`FunctionPass; <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>` on the first function, then all of the; :ref:`FunctionPasses <writing-an-llvm-pass-FunctionPass>` on the second; function, etc... until the entire program has been run through the passes.

Availability,"on and Compilation. As you observed, up to now we heavily exploited the capabilities of ROOT; for interpreting our code, more than compiling and then executing. This; is sufficient for a wide range of applications, but you might have; already asked yourself ""how can this code be compiled ?"". There are two; answers. ### Compile a Macro with ACLiC. ACLiC will create for you a compiled dynamic library for your macro,; without any effort from your side, except the insertion of the; appropriate header files in lines *5--11*. In this example, they are; already included. To generate an object library from the macro code, from inside the; interpreter type (please note the ""+""):. ``` {.cpp}; root [1] .L macro1.C+; ```. Once this operation is accomplished, the macro symbols will be available; in memory and you will be able to execute it simply by calling from; inside the interpreter:. ``` {.cpp}; root [2] macro1(); ```. ### Compile a Macro with the Compiler. A plethora of excellent compilers are available, both free and; commercial. We will refer to the `GCC` compiler in the following. In; this case, you have to include the appropriate headers in the code and; then exploit the *root-config* tool for the automatic settings of all; the compiler flags. *root-config* is a script that comes with ROOT; it; prints all flags and libraries needed to compile code and link it with; the ROOT libraries. In order to make the code executable stand-alone, an; entry point for the operating system is needed, in C++ this is the; procedure `int main();`. The easiest way to turn a ROOT macro code into; a stand-alone application is to add the following ""dressing code"" at the; end of the macro file. This defines the procedure main, the only purpose; of which is to call your macro:. ``` {.cpp}; int main() {; ExampleMacro();; return 0;; }; ```. To create a stand-alone program from a macro called `ExampleMacro.C`, simply type. ``` {.cpp}; > g++ -o ExampleMacro ExampleMacro.C `root-config --cflags --li",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/your_first_ROOT_macro.md:9973,avail,available,9973,documentation/primer/your_first_ROOT_macro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/primer/your_first_ROOT_macro.md,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"on is not exposed. This prevents inadvertent use of system; specific functionality. For example, the ``stat`` system call is notorious for having variations in the; data it provides. ``lib/Support`` must not declare ``stat`` nor allow it to be; declared. Instead it should provide its own interface to discovering; information about files and directories. Those interfaces may be implemented in; terms of ``stat`` but that is strictly an implementation detail. The interface; provided by the Support Library must be implemented on all platforms (even; those without ``stat``). No Exposed Data; ---------------. Any data defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``) must; not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header file; for that function is not exposed. As with functions, this prevents inadvertent; use of data that might not exist on all platforms. Minimize Soft Errors; --------------------. Operating system interfaces will generally provide error results for every; little thing that could go wrong. In almost all cases, you can divide these; error results into two groups: normal/good/soft and abnormal/bad/hard. That is,; some of the errors are simply information like ""file not found"", ""insufficient; privileges"", etc. while other errors are much harder like ""out of space"", ""bad; disk sector"", or ""system call interrupted"". We'll call the first group ""*soft*""; errors and the second group ""*hard*"" errors. ``lib/Support`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors. This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst:7304,error,error,7304,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"on methods of the ``DeclContext``, so; the vast majority of clients can ignore them. Because the same entity can be defined multiple times in different modules,; it is also possible for there to be multiple definitions of (for instance); a ``CXXRecordDecl``, all of which describe a definition of the same class.; In such a case, only one of those ""definitions"" is considered by Clang to be; the definition of the class, and the others are treated as non-defining; declarations that happen to also contain member declarations. Corresponding; members in each definition of such multiply-defined classes are identified; either by redeclaration chains (if the members are ``Redeclarable``); or by simply a pointer to the canonical declaration (if the declarations; are not ``Redeclarable`` -- in that case, a ``Mergeable`` base class is used; instead). Error Handling; --------------. Clang produces an AST even when the code contains errors. Clang won't generate; and optimize code for it, but it's used as parsing continues to detect further; errors in the input. Clang-based tools also depend on such ASTs, and IDEs in; particular benefit from a high-quality AST for broken code. In presence of errors, clang uses a few error-recovery strategies to present the; broken code in the AST:. - correcting errors: in cases where clang is confident about the fix, it; provides a FixIt attaching to the error diagnostic and emits a corrected AST; (reflecting the written code with FixIts applied). The advantage of that is to; provide more accurate subsequent diagnostics. Typo correction is a typical; example.; - representing invalid node: the invalid node is preserved in the AST in some; form, e.g. when the ""declaration"" part of the declaration contains semantic; errors, the Decl node is marked as invalid.; - dropping invalid node: this often happens for errors that we don’t have; graceful recovery.

A second important overhead is in unboxing Python proxies of C++ objects,; in particular when passed as an argument to a Numba-JITed function.; The main costs are in the lookup (types are matched at every invocation) and; to a lesser extent the subsequent copying of the instance data.; Thus, functions that take a C++ object as an argument will require more time; spent in the function body for JITing to be worth it than functions that do; not. The current implementation invokes C++ callables through function pointers; and accesses data through offsets calculations from the object's base; address.; A future implementation may be able to inline C++ into the Numba trace if; code is available in headers files or was JITed.

Remove address space builtin function; -------------------------------------. ``__remove_address_space`` allows to derive types in C++ for OpenCL; that have address space qualifiers removed. This utility only affects; address space qualifiers, therefore, other type qualifiers such as; ``const`` or ``volatile`` remain unchanged. **Example of Use**:. .. code-block:: c++. template<typename T>; void foo(T *par){; T var1; // error - local function variable with global address space; __private T var2; // error - conflicting address space qualifiers; __private __remove_address_space<T>::type var3; // var3 is __private int; }. void bar(){; __global int* ptr;; foo(ptr);; }.

Clang allows use of atomic functions from the OpenCL 1.x standards; with the generic address space pointer in C++ for OpenCL mode.

It can display and; control a hierarchy of multi-column items, and provides the ability to; add new items at any time. By default it doesn't map sub-windows, which; are items of the container. In this case sub-window must provide; `DrawCopy` method, see for example **`TGLVEntry`** class. It is also; possible to use option which allows mapping sub-windows. This option has; much slower drawing speed in case of more than 1000 items placed in; container. To activate this option the fMapSubwindows data member must; be set to `kTRUE` (for example **`TTVLVContainer`** class). A scroll bar only is available when scrolling is necessary.

The current implementation of `RVec` is based on LLVM's SmallVector, extracted; from the head of LLVM's repo around December 2020.; We are not tracking the upstream implementation. Compared to LLVM's SmallVectors:. - memory adoption capabilities have been added; - patches have been applied to make RVec work with (ROOT's version of) cppyy (notably `using` declarations had to be; lowered in the inheritance hierarchy for cppyy to pick them up); - `operator[](mask)` has been added, as well as several other ""numpy-like"" helper; functions (these latter ones are free functions); - logical operators `==`, `<`, `>` etc. return vectors rather than booleans; - the type of fSize and fCapacity is signed rather than unsigned, and fixed to 32 bits; - a number of minor patches have been applied for backward compatibility with the previous; implementation of RVec (which did not have a small buffer optimization and was implemented; in terms of `std::vector` with a custom allocator) and to make the code more consistent; with ROOT's coding conventions. ## RVec design. `SmallVectorBase`; - `fBeginX`; - `fSize`; - `fCapacity`. Basically the same as the corresponding LLVM class, with the template parameter removed: LLVM's SmallVectorBase; is templated over the type of fSize and fCapacity.

Availability,"operates with code produced by the new compiler (which will use native; the atomic instruction). Note that it's possible to write an entirely target-independent implementation; of these library functions by using the compiler atomic builtins themselves to; implement the operations on naturally-aligned pointers of supported sizes, and a; generic mutex implementation otherwise. Libcalls: __sync_*; ==================. Some targets or OS/target combinations can support lock-free atomics, but for; various reasons, it is not practical to emit the instructions inline. There's two typical examples of this. Some CPUs support multiple instruction sets which can be switched back and forth; on function-call boundaries. For example, MIPS supports the MIPS16 ISA, which; has a smaller instruction encoding than the usual MIPS32 ISA. ARM, similarly,; has the Thumb ISA. In MIPS16 and earlier versions of Thumb, the atomic; instructions are not encodable. However, those instructions are available via a; function call to a function with the longer encoding. Additionally, a few OS/target pairs provide kernel-supported lock-free; atomics. ARM/Linux is an example of this: the kernel `provides; <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/arm/kernel_user_helpers.txt>`_ a; function which on older CPUs contains a ""magically-restartable"" atomic sequence; (which looks atomic so long as there's only one CPU), and contains actual atomic; instructions on newer multicore models. This sort of functionality can typically; be provided on any architecture, if all CPUs which are missing atomic; compare-and-swap support are uniprocessor (no SMP). This is almost always the; case. The only common architecture without that property is SPARC -- SPARCV8 SMP; systems were common, yet it doesn't support any sort of compare-and-swap; operation. Some targets (like RISCV) support a ``+forced-atomics`` target feature, which; enables the use of lock-free atomics even if LLVM is not aware of any specific; OS support for ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst:26904,avail,available,26904,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Atomics.rst,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"operating system; to preclude mapping memory in the low two gigabytes of address space. ###### 64-bit load checking instructions. We can use the following instruction sequences to check loads. We set up `%r8`; in these examples to hold the special value of `-1` which will be `cmov`ed over; `%rax` in misspeculated paths. Single register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi), %edi; ```. Two register addressing mode:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; orq %rax, %rsi # Mask the pointer if misspeculating.; orq %rax, %rcx # Mask the index if misspeculating.; movl (%rsi,%rcx), %edi; ```. This will result in a negative address near zero or in `offset` wrapping the; address space back to a small positive address. Small, negative addresses will; fault in user-mode for most operating systems, but targets which need the high; address space to be user accessible may need to adjust the exact sequence used; above. Additionally, the low addresses will need to be marked unreadable by the; OS to fully harden the load. ###### RIP-relative addressing is even easier to break. There is a common addressing mode idiom that is substantially harder to check:; addressing relative to the instruction pointer. We cannot change the value of; the instruction pointer register and so we have the harder problem of forcing; `%base + scale * %index + offset` to be an invalid address, by *only* changing; `%index`. The only advantage we have is that the attacker also cannot modify; `%base`. If we use the fast instruction sequence above, but only apply it to; the index, we will always access `%rip + (scale * -1) + offset`. If the; attacker can find a load which with this address happens to point to secret; data, then they can reach it.

The :program:`opt` command is the modular LLVM optimizer and analyzer. It takes; LLVM source files as input, runs the specified optimizations or analyses on it,; and then outputs the optimized file. The optimizations available via; :program:`opt` depend upon what libraries were linked into it as well as any; additional libraries that have been loaded with the :option:`-load` option. Use; the :option:`-help` option to determine what optimizations you can use. If ``filename`` is omitted from the command line or is ""``-``"", :program:`opt`; reads its input from standard input. Inputs can be in either the LLVM assembly; language format (``.ll``) or the LLVM bitcode format (``.bc``). If an output filename is not specified with the :option:`-o` option,; :program:`opt` writes its output to the standard output. OPTIONS; -------. .. option:: -f. Enable binary output on terminals. Normally, :program:`opt` will refuse to; write raw bitcode output if the output stream is a terminal. With this option,; :program:`opt` will write raw bitcode regardless of the output device. .. option:: -help. Print a summary of command line options. .. option:: -o <filename>. Specify the output filename. .. option:: -S. Write output in LLVM intermediate language (instead of bitcode). .. option:: -{passname}. :program:`opt` provides the ability to run any of LLVM's optimization or; analysis passes in any order. The :option:`-help` option lists all the passes; available. The order in which the options occur on the command line are the; order in which they are executed (within pass constraints). .. option:: -strip-debug.

A classic theory for the reason why modules speed up the compilation is:; if there are ``n`` headers and ``m`` source files and each header is included by each source file,; then the complexity of the compilation is ``O(n*m)``;; But if there are ``n`` module interfaces and ``m`` source files, the complexity of the compilation is; ``O(n+m)``. So, using modules would be a big win when scaling.; In a simpler word, we could get rid of many redundant compilations by using modules. Roughly, this theory is correct. But the problem is that it is too rough.; The behavior depends on the optimization level, as we will illustrate below. First is ``O0``. The compilation process is described in the following graph. .. code-block:: none. ├-------------frontend----------┼-------------middle end----------------┼----backend----┤; │ │ │ │; └---parsing----sema----codegen--┴----- transformations ---- codegen ----┴---- codegen --┘. ┌---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------┐; | │; | source file │; | │; └---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------┘. ┌--------┐; │ │; │imported│; │ │; │ code │; │ │; └--------┘. Here we can see that the source file (could be a non-module unit or a module unit) would get processed by the; whole pipeline.; But the imported code would only get involved in semantic analysis, which is mainly about name lookup,; overload re",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst:40074,redundant,redundant,40074,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.rst,1,['redundant'],['redundant']

For example,; the following directives look for unordered log entries for two tasks in a; parallel program, such as the OpenMP runtime:. .. code-block:: text. // CHECK-DAG: [[THREAD_ID:[0-9]+]]: task_begin; // CHECK-DAG: [[THREAD_ID]]: task_end; //; // CHECK-DAG: [[THREAD_ID:[0-9]+]]: task_begin; // CHECK-DAG: [[THREAD_ID]]: task_end. The second pair of directives is guaranteed not to match the same log entries; as the first pair even though the patterns are identical and even if the text; of the log entries is identical because the thread ID manages to be reused. The ""CHECK-LABEL:"" directive; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Sometimes in a file containing multiple tests divided into logical blocks, one; or more ``CHECK:`` directives may inadvertently succeed by matching lines in a; later block. While an error will usually eventually be generated, the check; flagged as causing the error may not actually bear any relationship to the; actual source of the problem. In order to produce better error messages in these cases, the ""``CHECK-LABEL:``""; directive can be used. It is treated identically to a normal ``CHECK``; directive except that FileCheck makes an additional assumption that a line; matched by the directive cannot also be matched by any other check present in; ``match-filename``; this is intended to be used for lines containing labels or; other unique identifiers. Conceptually, the presence of ``CHECK-LABEL`` divides; the input stream into separate blocks, each of which is processed independently,; preventing a ``CHECK:`` directive in one block matching a line in another block.; If ``--enable-var-scope`` is in effect, all local variables are cleared at the; beginning of the block. For example,. .. code-block:: llvm. define %struct.C* @C_ctor_base(%struct.C* %this, i32 %x) {; entry:; ; CHECK-LABEL: C_ctor_base:; ; CHECK: mov [[SAVETHIS:r[0-9]+]], r0; ; CH",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:21528,error,error,21528,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,2,['error'],['error']

Furthermore, because of this approach,; \<`tab`\>-completion will usually not be available until after the first; use (and hence creation) of a class. Access to class static functions, public data members, enums, etc. is as; expected.

The recipes; section contains a description on working with your own classes (see; ""Using Your Own Classes""). #### Access to STL Classes. The STL classes live in the ROOT.std namespace (or, if you prefer to get; them from there, in the ROOT module directly, but doing so makes the; code less clear, of course). Be careful in their use, because Python; already has types called ""`string`"" and ""`list`."".

The fitting of the data objects in ROOT, histograms, graphs and tree is performed via some common classes,; which are defined in the `ROOT::Fit` namespace.; These classes can be classified in the following groups:. * User classes driving the fit: `ROOT::Fit::Fitter` for executing the fit, `ROOT::Fit::FitConfig` for configuring the fit,; 	`ROOT::Fit::ParameterSettings` to define the properties of the fit parameters (initial; 	values, bounds, etc..), `ROOT::Fit::FitResult` for storing the result of the fit.; * Data classes containing the data sets used in the fitting. These classes are the`ROOT::Fit::BinData`for describing bin data sets,; 	 thus data points containing both coordinates and a corresponding value/weight; 	 with optionally an error on the value or the coordinate and the `ROOT::Fit::UnBinData` for un-binned data sets,; 	 which consists only of a vector of coordinate values. The coordinate values can be; 	 one-dimensional (i.e. one entry per event) or multi-dimensional (N entries per event).; * Function classes defining the type of fit (the objective function used for fitting):; 	- `ROOT::Fit::Chi2FCN` for chi2 (least-square fits),; 	- `ROOT::Fit::PoissonLikelihoodFCN` for binned likelihood fits of histograms,; 	- `ROOT::Fit::LogLikelihoodFCN` for generic un-binned likelihood fits.; 	These classes are templated on the type of function interface they implement (see later). User convenient typedefs are also provided.; 	They derive from the common generic interface multi-dimensional for function evaluation, `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionMultiDim`. In addition the fitter classes make uses of the generic interfaces for parametric function evaluations, `ROOT::Math::IParametricFunctionMultiDim`; to define t",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:27076,error,error,27076,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['error'],['error']

It is made of neurons characterized by a bias and weighted links in; between - let's call those links synapses. The input neurons receive; the inputs, normalize them and forward them to the first hidden layer.; Each neuron in any subsequent layer first computes a linear; combination of the outputs of the previous layer. The output of the; neuron is then function of that combination with f being linear for; output neurons or a sigmoid for hidden layers. Such a structure is very useful because of two theorems:. 1- A linear combination of `sigmoids` can approximate any continuous; function. 2- Trained with `output=1` for the signal and 0 for the background,; the approximated function of inputs `X` is the probability of signal,; knowing `X`. ### Learning Methods. The aim of all learning methods is to minimize the total error on a; set of weighted examples. The error is defined as the sum in quadrate,; divided by two, of the error on each individual output neuron. In all; methods implemented in this library, one needs to compute the first; derivative of that error with respect to the weights. Exploiting the; well-known properties of the derivative, one can express this; derivative as the product of the local partial derivative by the; weighted sum of the outputs derivatives (for a neuron) or as the; product of the input value with the local partial derivative of the; output neuron (for a synapse). This computation is called; ""back-propagation of the errors"". Six learning methods are; implemented. #### Stochastic Minimization. This is the most trivial learning method. The Robbins-Monro stochastic; approximation is applied to multilayer perceptrons. The weights are; updated after each example according to the formula:. $$; w_{ij}(t+1) = w_{ij}(t) + \Delta w_{ij}(t); $$. with:. $$; \Delta w_{ij}(t) = - \eta \left(; \frac{\partial e_p}{\partial w_{ij}} + \delta \right) +; \epsilon \Delta w_{ij}(",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:71501,error,error,71501,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,2,['error'],['error']

In contrast, values of the retainable object pointer types are; never interior. * The type system must reliably indicate how to manage objects of a type.; This usually means that the type must imply a procedure for incrementing; and decrementing retain counts.

What; declarations in those headers are actually meant to be part of the; API, and what declarations are present only because they had to be; written as part of the header file?. Semantic import; ---------------; Modules improve access to the API of software libraries by replacing the textual preprocessor inclusion model with a more robust, more efficient semantic model. From the user's perspective, the code looks only slightly different, because one uses an ``import`` declaration rather than a ``#include`` preprocessor directive:. .. code-block:: c. import std.io; // pseudo-code; see below for syntax discussion. However, this module import behaves quite differently from the corresponding ``#include <stdio.h>``: when the compiler sees the module import above, it loads a binary representation of the ``std.io`` module and makes its API available to the application directly. Preprocessor definitions that precede the import declaration have no impact on the API provided by ``std.io``, because the module itself was compiled as a separate, standalone module. Additionally, any linker flags required to use the ``std.io`` module will automatically be provided when the module is imported [#]_; This semantic import model addresses many of the problems of the preprocessor inclusion model:. * **Compile-time scalability**: The ``std.io`` module is only compiled once, and importing the module into a translation unit is a constant-time operation (independent of module system). Thus, the API of each software library is only parsed once, reducing the *M x N* compilation problem to an *M + N* problem. * **Fragility**: Each module is parsed as a standalone entity, so it has a consistent preprocessor environment. This completely eliminates the need for ``__underscored`` names and similarly defensive tricks.

Now imagine the following AST, where the ``->`` represents dependency in terms; of the import (all nodes are declarations). .. code-block:: text. A->B->C->D; `->E.

A; AB; ABC; ABCD; ABC; AB; ABE; AB; A. If during the visit of E there is an error then we set an error for E, then as; the call stack shrinks for B, then for A:. .. code-block:: text. A; AB; ABC; ABCD; ABC; AB; ABE // Error! Set an error to E; AB // Set an error to B; A // Set an error to A. However, during the import we could import C and D without any error and they; are independent of A,B and E. We must not set up an error for C and D. So, at; the end of the import we have an entry in ``ImportDeclErrors`` for A,B,E but; not for C,D. Now, what happens if there is a cycle in the import path?

(In the limit that a; given parameter is uncorrelated with parameter $\mbox{n}$, its error; will not change when parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed.) However the; procedure is not reversible, since M forgets the original error matrix,; so if parameter $\mbox{n}$ is then released (e.g. via the method; MnMigrad::release(n)), the error matrix is considered as unknown and has; to be recalculated with appropriate commands. ### $\mbox{MINOS}$ errors ###.

Currently, when ROOT is built with `-Druntime_cxxmodules=On` it gives priority to; C++ Module files (real *pcm* files). If such a file is present it reads all; necessary information from it.

The Strategy and the Precision options apply instead only for *Minuit* (and; *Minuit2*). The class supports also setting global default values for the options, by using the static functions `MinimizerOptions::SetDefault...` (for example `MinimizerOptions::SetDefaultPrintLevel(int )`). The; static functions can be also used to set the minimizer options when using `TH1::Fit` or `TGraph::Fit`.; The list of the current option values can be inspected by using `MinimizerOptions::Print`.; ```{.cpp}; ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions() opt;; // print the default minimizer option values; opt.Print();; ```.

Here we have now all the required input ingredients for the fit, the data and the function to fit.; Depending on these we have now several different way to perform the fit, using the corresponding methods of the; `ROOT::Fit::Fitter` class and depending on the type of input data. #### Available fit methods. * **Least-square fit**: `Fitter::LeastSquare(const BinData & )` or `Fitter::Fit(const Bindata &)`. It requires the user to pass a `BinData` object. It should be used when the data values follow a; Gaussian distribution. This fit method is implemented using the class `ROOT::Fit::Chi2FCN`.; * **Binned Likelihood fit** : `Fitter::LikelihoodFit(const Bindata & )`. The user needs to pass a `BinData` object.

In the C family of languages, the interface to a library is accessed by including the appropriate header files(s):. .. code-block:: c. #include <SomeLib.h>. The implementation is handled separately by linking against the appropriate library. For example, by passing ``-lSomeLib`` to the linker. Modules provide an alternative, simpler way to use software libraries that provides better compile-time scalability and eliminates many of the problems inherent to using the C preprocessor to access the API of a library. Problems with the current model; -------------------------------; The ``#include`` mechanism provided by the C preprocessor is a very poor way to access the API of a library, for a number of reasons:. * **Compile-time scalability**: Each time a header is included, the; compiler must preprocess and parse the text in that header and every; header it includes, transitively. This process must be repeated for; every translation unit in the application, which involves a huge; amount of redundant work. In a project with *N* translation units; and *M* headers included in each translation unit, the compiler is; performing *M x N* work even though most of the *M* headers are; shared among multiple translation units. C++ is particularly bad,; because the compilation model for templates forces a huge amount of; code into headers. * **Fragility**: ``#include`` directives are treated as textual; inclusion by the preprocessor, and are therefore subject to any; active macro definitions at the time of inclusion. If any of the; active macro definitions happens to collide with a name in the; library, it can break the library API or cause compilation failures; in the library header itself. For an extreme example,; ``#define std ""The C++ Standard""`` and then include a standard; library header: the result is a horrific cascade of failures in the; C++ Standard Library's implementation.

Availability,"out the fix, it; provides a FixIt attaching to the error diagnostic and emits a corrected AST; (reflecting the written code with FixIts applied). The advantage of that is to; provide more accurate subsequent diagnostics. Typo correction is a typical; example.; - representing invalid node: the invalid node is preserved in the AST in some; form, e.g. when the ""declaration"" part of the declaration contains semantic; errors, the Decl node is marked as invalid.; - dropping invalid node: this often happens for errors that we don’t have; graceful recovery. Prior to Recovery AST, a mismatched-argument function call; expression was dropped though a CallExpr was created for semantic analysis. With these strategies, clang surfaces better diagnostics, and provides AST; consumers a rich AST reflecting the written source code as much as possible even; for broken code. Recovery AST; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. The idea of Recovery AST is to use recovery nodes which act as a placeholder to; maintain the rough structure of the parsing tree, preserve locations and; children but have no language semantics attached to them. For example, consider the following mismatched function call:. .. code-block:: c++. int NoArg();; void test(int abc) {; NoArg(abc); // oops, mismatched function arguments.; }. Without Recovery AST, the invalid function call expression (and its child; expressions) would be dropped in the AST:. ::. |-FunctionDecl <line:1:1, col:11> NoArg 'int ()'; `-FunctionDecl <line:2:1, line:4:1> test 'void (int)'; |-ParmVarDecl <col:11, col:15> col:15 used abc 'int'; `-CompoundStmt <col:20, line:4:1>.

It is perfectly acceptable to review code and explicitly; defer to others for approval decisions. Experts Should Review Code; --------------------------. If you are an expert in an area of the compiler affected by a proposed patch,; then you are highly encouraged to review the code. If you are a relevant code; owner, and no other experts are reviewing a patch, you must either help arrange; for an expert to review the patch or review it yourself. Code Reviews, Speed, and Reciprocity; ------------------------------------. Sometimes code reviews will take longer than you might hope, especially for; larger features. Common ways to speed up review times for your patches are:. * Review other people's patches. If you help out, everybody will be more; willing to do the same for you; goodwill is our currency.; * Ping the patch. If it is urgent, provide reasons why it is important to you to; get this patch landed and ping it every couple of days. If it is; not urgent, the common courtesy ping rate is one week. Remember that you're; asking for valuable time from other professional developers.; * Ask for help on IRC. Developers on IRC will be able to either help you; directly, or tell you who might be a good reviewer.; * Split your patch into multiple smaller patches that build on each other. The; smaller your patch is, the higher the probability that somebody will take a quick; look at it. When doing this, it is helpful to add ""[N/M]"" (for 1 <= N <= M) to; the title of each patch in the series, so it is clear that there is an order; and what that order is. Developers should participate in code reviews as both reviewers and; authors. If someone is kind enough to review your code, you should return the; favor for someone else.

For layering reasons, ``MachineVerifier`` isn't able to be the sole verifier; in GlobalISel. Currently some of the passes also perform verification while; we find a way to solve this problem.

An alternative is to use existing Exprs, e.g. CallExpr for the above example.; This would capture more call details (e.g. locations of parentheses) and allow; it to be treated uniformly with valid CallExprs. However, jamming the data we; have into CallExpr forces us to weaken its invariants, e.g. arg count may be; wrong. This would introduce a huge burden on consumers of the AST to handle such; ""impossible"" cases. So when we're representing (rather than correcting) errors,; we use a distinct recovery node type with extremely weak invariants instead. ``RecoveryExpr`` is the only recovery node so far. In practice, broken decls; need more detailed semantics preserved (the current ``Invalid`` flag works; fairly well), and completely broken statements with interesting internal; structure are rare (so dropping the statements is OK). Types and dependence; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. ``RecoveryExpr`` is an ``Expr``, so it must have a type. In many cases the true; type can't really be known until the code is corrected (e.g. a call to a; function that doesn't exist). And it means that we can't properly perform type; checks on some containing constructs, such as ``return 42 + unknownFunction()``. To model this, we generalize the concept of dependence from C++ templates to; mean dependence on a template parameter or how an error is repaired. The; ``RecoveryExpr`` ``unknownFunction()`` has the totally unknown type; ``DependentTy``, and this suppresses type-based analysis in the same way it; would inside a template.

On the; other hand, if a1.cpp and b1.cpp both define ""foo"" there is no error (different; dynamic libraries may define the same symbol). If main.cpp refers to ""foo"", it; should bind to the definition in LibA rather than the one in LibB, since; main.cpp is part of the ""main"" dylib, and the main dylib links against LibA; before LibB.

The obvious answer is: Yes, that is quite a; possible case. We usually *do* have duplicates and it would be good to get rid; of them. But how do we detect duplicates? This is the idea: we split functions; into smaller bricks or parts and compare the ""bricks"" amount. If equal,; we compare the ""bricks"" themselves, and then do our conclusions about functions; themselves. What could the difference be? For example, on a machine with 64-bit pointers; (let's assume we have only one address space), one function stores a 64-bit; integer, while another one stores a pointer.

On the other; hand, value 2 (high) indicates that M is allowed to waste function calls; in order to be sure that all values are precise; it is intended for; cases where the function is evaluated in a relatively short time and/or; where the parameter errors must be calculated reliably. In addition all; constants set in MnStrategy can be changed individually by the user,; e.g. the number of iteration cycles in the numerical gradient. ## Parameter errors ##. M is usually used to find the ""best"" values of a set of parameters,; where ""best"" is defined as those values which minimize a given function,; $\mbox{FCN}$. The width of the function minimum, or more generally,; the shape of the function in some neighbourhood of the minimum, gives; information about the *uncertainty* in the best parameter values, often; called by physicists the *parameter errors*. An important feature of M; is that it offers several tools to analyze the parameter errors. ### $\mbox{FCN}$ normalization and the error definition ###. Whatever method is used to calculate the parameter errors, they will; depend on the overall (multiplicative) normalization of; $\mbox{FCN}$, in the sense that if the value of $\mbox{FCN}$ is; everywhere multiplied by a constant $\beta$, then the errors will be; decreased by a factor $\sqrt{\beta}$. Additive constants do not change; the parameter errors, but may imply a different goodness-of-fit; confidence level. Assuming that the user knows what the normalization of their; $\mbox{FCN}$ means, and also that they are interested in parameter; errors, the user can change the error definition which allows them to; define what they means by one ""error"", in terms of the change in the; $\mbox{FCN}$ value which should be caused by changing one parameter; by one ""error"".

For example, the following code snippet depends on the values of XMM1 (which; will be set by the tool) and the memory buffer passed in RDI (live in). .. code-block:: none. # LLVM-EXEGESIS-LIVEIN RDI; # LLVM-EXEGESIS-DEFREG XMM1 42; vmulps	(%rdi), %xmm1, %xmm2; vhaddps	%xmm2, %xmm2, %xmm3; addq $0x10, %rdi. Example 3: benchmarking with memory annotations; -----------------------------------------------. Some snippets require memory setup in specific places to execute without; crashing. Setting up memory can be accomplished with the `LLVM-EXEGESIS-MEM-DEF`; and `LLVM-EXEGESIS-MEM-MAP` annotations.

If all contained errors can be handled, ``handleErrors`` will return; ``Error::success()``, otherwise ``handleErrors`` will concatenate the remaining; errors and return the resulting ``ErrorList``. Building fallible iterators and iterator ranges; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". The archive walking examples above retrieve archive members by index, however; this requires considerable boiler-plate for iteration and error checking. We can; clean this up by using the ""fallible iterator"" pattern, which supports the; following natural iteration idiom for fallible containers like Archive:. .. code-block:: c++. Error Err = Error::success();; for (auto &Child : Ar->children(Err)) {; // Use Child - only enter the loop when it's valid. // Allow early exit from the loop body, since we know that Err is success; // when we're inside the loop.; if (BailOutOn(Child)); return;. ...; }; // Check Err after the loop to ensure it didn't break due to an error.; if (Err); return Err;. To enable this idiom, iterators over fallible containers are written in a; natural style, with their ``++`` and ``--`` operators replaced with fallible; ``Error inc()`` and ``Error dec()`` functions. E.g.:. .. code-block:: c++. class FallibleChildIterator {; public:; FallibleChildIterator(Archive &A, unsigned ChildIdx);; Archive::Child &operator*();; friend bool operator==(const ArchiveIterator &LHS,; const ArchiveIterator &RHS);. // operator++/operator-- replaced with fallible increment / decrement:; Error inc() {; if (!A.childValid(ChildIdx + 1)); return make_error<BadArchiveMember>(...);; ++ChildIdx;; return Error::success();; }. Error dec() { ... }; };. Instances of this kind of fallible iterator interface are then wrapped with the; fallible_iterator utility which provides ``operator++`` and ``operator--``,; returning any errors via a reference passed in to the wrapper at construction; time. The fallible_iterator wrapper",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:37584,error,error,37584,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"pe qualifiers like ``const`` or ``volatile``; (see :ref:`QualType <QualType>`), and 2) they implicitly capture typedef; information. Once created, types are immutable (unlike decls). Typedefs in C make semantic analysis a bit more complex than it would be without; them. The issue is that we want to capture typedef information and represent it; in the AST perfectly, but the semantics of operations need to ""see through""; typedefs. For example, consider this code:. .. code-block:: c++. void func() {; typedef int foo;; foo X, *Y;; typedef foo *bar;; bar Z;; *X; // error; **Y; // error; **Z; // error; }. The code above is illegal, and thus we expect there to be diagnostics emitted; on the annotated lines. In this example, we expect to get:. .. code-block:: text. test.c:6:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); *X; // error; ^~; test.c:7:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); **Y; // error; ^~~; test.c:8:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); **Z; // error; ^~~. While this example is somewhat silly, it illustrates the point: we want to; retain typedef information where possible, so that we can emit errors about; ""``std::string``"" instead of ""``std::basic_string<char, std:...``"". Doing this; requires properly keeping typedef information (for example, the type of ``X``; is ""``foo``"", not ""``int``""), and requires properly propagating it through the; various operators (for example, the type of ``*Y`` is ""``foo``"", not; ""``int``""). In order to retain this information, the type of these expressions; is an instance of the ``TypedefType`` class, which indicates that the type of; these expressions is a typedef for ""``foo``"". Representing types like this is great for diagnostics, because the; user-specified type is always immediately available. There are two problems; with this: first, various semantic checks need to make judgements about the; *actual structure* of a type, ignoring typedefs.

Clang provides a number of ways to control which code constructs cause; it to emit errors and warning messages, and how they are displayed to; the console. Controlling How Clang Displays Diagnostics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. When Clang emits a diagnostic, it includes rich information in the; output, and gives you fine-grain control over which information is; printed. Clang has the ability to print this information, and these are; the options that control it:. #. A file/line/column indicator that shows exactly where the diagnostic; occurs in your code [:ref:`-fshow-column <opt_fshow-column>`,; :ref:`-fshow-source-location <opt_fshow-source-location>`].; #. A categorization of the diagnostic as a note, warning, error, or; fatal error.; #. A text string that describes what the problem is.; #. An option that indicates how to control the diagnostic (for; diagnostics that support it); [:ref:`-fdiagnostics-show-option <opt_fdiagnostics-show-option>`].; #. A :ref:`high-level category <diagnostics_categories>` for the diagnostic; for clients that want to group diagnostics by class (for diagnostics; that support it); [:option:`-fdiagnostics-show-category`].; #. The line of source code that the issue occurs on, along with a caret; and ranges that indicate the important locations; [:ref:`-fcaret-diagnostics <opt_fcaret-diagnostics>`].; #. ""FixIt"" information, which is a concise explanation of how to fix the; problem (when Clang is certain it knows); [:ref:`-fdiagnostics-fixit-info <opt_fdiagnostics-fixit-info>`].; #. A machine-parsable representation of the ranges involved (off by; default); [:ref:`-fdiagnostics-print-source-range-info <opt_fdiagnostics-print-source-range-info>`].

Availability,"pects the bounds annotation on; the expression type, including the bounds annotation is implcit. For example,; the global variable ``g`` in the following code is implicitly ``__single`` so; ``typeof(g)`` gets ``char *__single``. The similar is true for the parameter; ``p``, so ``typeof(p)`` returns ``void *__single``. The local variable ``l`` is; implicitly ``__bidi_indexable``, so ``typeof(l)`` becomes; ``int *__bidi_indexable``. .. code-block:: C. char *g; // typeof(g) == char *__single. void foo(void *p) {; // typeof(p) == void *__single. int *l; // typeof(l) == int *__bidi_indexable; }. When the type of expression has an ""external"" bounds annotation, e.g.,; ``__sized_by``, ``__counted_by``, etc., the compiler may report an error on; ``typeof`` if the annotation creates a dependency with another declaration or; variable. For example, the compiler reports an error on ``typeof(p1)`` shown in; the following code because allowing it can potentially create another type; dependent on the parameter ``size`` in a different context (Please note that an; external bounds annotation on a parameter may only refer to another parameter of; the same function). On the other hand, ``typeof(p2)`` works resulting in ``int; *__counted_by(10)``, since it doesn't depend on any other declaration. .. TODO: add a section describing constraints on external bounds annotations. .. code-block:: C. void foo(int *__counted_by(size) p1, size_t size) {; // typeof(p1) == int *__counted_by(size); // -> a compiler error as it tries to create another type; // dependent on `size`. int *__counted_by(10) p2; // typeof(p2) == int *__counted_by(10); // -> no error. }. When ``typeof()`` takes a type name, the compiler doesn't apply an implicit; bounds annotation on the named pointer types. For example, ``typeof(int*)``; returns ``int *`` without any bounds annotation. A bounds annotation may be; added after the fact depending on the context. In the following example,; ``typeof(int *)`` returns ``int *`` so",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst:26399,error,error,26399,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafety.rst,1,['error'],['error']

Availability,"ped network connection, etc.), or; malformed input. These errors should be detected and communicated to a level of; the program where they can be handled appropriately. Handling the error may be; as simple as reporting the issue to the user, or it may involve attempts at; recovery. .. note::. While it would be ideal to use this error handling scheme throughout; LLVM, there are places where this hasn't been practical to apply. In; situations where you absolutely must emit a non-programmatic error and; the ``Error`` model isn't workable you can call ``report_fatal_error``,; which will call installed error handlers, print a message, and abort the; program. The use of `report_fatal_error` in this case is discouraged. Recoverable errors are modeled using LLVM's ``Error`` scheme. This scheme; represents errors using function return values, similar to classic C integer; error codes, or C++'s ``std::error_code``. However, the ``Error`` class is; actually a lightweight wrapper for user-defined error types, allowing arbitrary; information to be attached to describe the error. This is similar to the way C++; exceptions allow throwing of user-defined types. Success values are created by calling ``Error::success()``, E.g.:. .. code-block:: c++. Error foo() {; // Do something.; // Return success.; return Error::success();; }. Success values are very cheap to construct and return - they have minimal; impact on program performance. Failure values are constructed using ``make_error<T>``, where ``T`` is any class; that inherits from the ErrorInfo utility, E.g.:. .. code-block:: c++. class BadFileFormat : public ErrorInfo<BadFileFormat> {; public:; static char ID;; std::string Path;. BadFileFormat(StringRef Path) : Path(Path.str()) {}. void log(raw_ostream &OS) const override {; OS << Path << "" is malformed"";; }. std::error_code convertToErrorCode() const override {; return make_error_code(object_error::parse_failed);; }; };. char BadFileFormat::ID; // This should be declared in the C",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:18735,error,error,18735,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,2,['error'],['error']

Therefore, errors based on; the M error matrix take account of all the parameter correlations, but; not the non-linearities. That is, from the error matrix alone,; two-standard-deviation errors are always exactly twice as big as; one-standard-deviation errors. When the error matrix has been calculated (for example by the successful; execution of $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (MnMigrad::operator(), see; [api:migradop]) or HESSE (MnHesse::operator())) then the parameter; errors printed by M are the square roots of the diagonal elements of; this matrix. The covariance or the correlations can be printed and shown; via std::cout as the ostream operator operator$<<$ is overloaded. The; eigenvalues of the error matrix can be calculated using MnEigen, which; should all be positive if the matrix is positive-definite (see below on; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ and positive-definiteness). The effect of correlations on the individual parameter errors can be; seen as follows. When parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed (e.g. via the; method MnMigrad::fix(n)), M inverts the error matrix, removes the row; and column corresponding to parameter $\mbox{n}$, and re-inverts the; result. The effect on the errors of the other parameters will in general; be to make them smaller, since the component due to the uncertainty in; parameter $\mbox{n}$ has now been removed. (In the limit that a; given parameter is uncorrelated with parameter $\mbox{n}$, its error; will not change when parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed.) However the; procedure is not reversible, since M forgets the original error matrix,; so if parameter $\mbox{n}$ is then released (e.g. via the method; MnMigrad::release(n)), the error matrix is considered as unknown and has; to be recalculated with appropriate commands. ### $\mbox{MINOS}$",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:16410,error,error,16410,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['error'],['error']

This branch (**`TBranchRef`**); will keep all the information needed to find the branches containing; referenced objects at each `Tree::Fill`, the branch numbers containing; the referenced objects are saved in the table of references. When the; Tree header is saved (via `TTree::Write` for example), the branch is; saved, keeping the information with the pointers to the branches having; referenced objects. Enabling this optional table, allow; `TTree::Draw` to automatically load the branches needed to; dereference a **`TRef`** (or **`TRefArray`**) object. ### Autosave. `Autosave` gives the option to save all branch buffers every `n` byte.; We recommend using `Autosave` for large acquisitions. If the acquisition; fails to complete, you can recover the file and all the contents since; the last `Autosave`. To set the number of bytes between `Autosave` you; can use the `TTree::SetAutosave()` method. You can also call; **`TTree::Autosave` in the acquisition loop every `n `entry.**. ### Trees with Circular Buffers.

For example, this can be very useful; for monitoring purpose. ``` {.cpp}; void TTree::SetCircular(Long64_t maxEntries);; ```. where `maxEntries` is the maximum number of entries to be kept in the; buffers. When the number of entries exceeds this value, the first; entries in the **`Tree`** are deleted and the buffers used again.

That makes it a lot easier for programmers wishing to compile to; different platforms and architectures, and for compiler developers that; only have to maintain one build system, and for OS distributions, that; need only one set of main packages. But, as is true to any cross-compiler, and given the complexity of; different architectures, OS's and options, it's not always easy finding; the headers, libraries or binutils to generate target specific code.; So you'll need special options to help Clang understand what target; you're compiling to, where your tools are, etc. Another problem is that compilers come with standard libraries only (like; ``compiler-rt``, ``libcxx``, ``libgcc``, ``libm``, etc), so you'll have to; find and make available to the build system, every other library required; to build your software, that is specific to your target.

This is mainly used for; pointers to incomplete types or types without size such as ``void *``.; * ``__ended_by(P)`` : The pointer has the upper bound of value ``P``, which is; one past the last element of the pointer. In other words, this annotation; describes a range that starts with the pointer that has this annotation and; ends with ``P`` which is the argument of the annotation. ``P`` itself may be; annotated with ``__ended_by(Q)``. In this case, the end of the range extends; to the pointer ``Q``.

Also, the model maintains correctness of bounds annotations; when the pointer and/or the related value containing the bounds information are; updated or passed as arguments.

For instance, initializing ``buf`` with ``null`` while; assigning non-zero value to ``count``, as shown in the following example, would; violate the ``__counted_by`` annotation because a null pointer does not point to; any valid memory location.

As with functions, this prevents inadvertent; use of data that might not exist on all platforms. Minimize Soft Errors; --------------------. Operating system interfaces will generally provide error results for every; little thing that could go wrong. In almost all cases, you can divide these; error results into two groups: normal/good/soft and abnormal/bad/hard. That is,; some of the errors are simply information like ""file not found"", ""insufficient; privileges"", etc. while other errors are much harder like ""out of space"", ""bad; disk sector"", or ""system call interrupted"".

This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level.

In the absence of native support, a type can still be; supported if the compiler can emulate arithmetic on the type by promoting; to ``float``; see below for more information on this emulation. * ``__fp16`` is supported on all targets. The special semantics of this; type mean that no arithmetic is ever performed directly on ``__fp16`` values;; see below. * ``_Float16`` is supported on the following targets:. * 32-bit ARM (natively on some architecture versions); * 64-bit ARM (AArch64) (natively on ARMv8.2a and above); * AMDGPU (natively); * SPIR (natively); * X86 (if SSE2 is available; natively if AVX512-FP16 is also available); * RISC-V (natively if Zfh or Zhinx is available). * ``__bf16`` is supported on the following targets (currently never natively):. * 32-bit ARM; * 64-bit ARM (AArch64); * RISC-V; * X86 (when SSE2 is available). (For X86, SSE2 is available on 64-bit and all recent 32-bit processors.). ``__fp16`` and ``_Float16`` both use the binary16 format from IEEE; 754-2008, which provides a 5-bit exponent and an 11-bit significand; (counting the implicit leading 1). ``__bf16`` uses the `bfloat16; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format>`_ format,; which provides an 8-bit exponent and an 8-bit significand; this is the same; exponent range as `float`, just with greatly reduced precision. ``_Float16`` and ``__bf16`` follow the usual rules for arithmetic; floating-point types. Most importantly, this means that arithmetic operations; on operands of these types are formally performed in the type and produce; values of the type. ``__fp16`` does not follow those rules: most operations; immediately promote operands of type ``__fp16`` to ``float``, and so; arithmetic operations are defined to be performed in ``float`` and so result in; a value of type ``float`` (unless further promoted because of other operands).; See below for ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst:31133,avail,available,31133,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"possible even; for broken code. Recovery AST; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. The idea of Recovery AST is to use recovery nodes which act as a placeholder to; maintain the rough structure of the parsing tree, preserve locations and; children but have no language semantics attached to them. For example, consider the following mismatched function call:. .. code-block:: c++. int NoArg();; void test(int abc) {; NoArg(abc); // oops, mismatched function arguments.; }. Without Recovery AST, the invalid function call expression (and its child; expressions) would be dropped in the AST:. ::. |-FunctionDecl <line:1:1, col:11> NoArg 'int ()'; `-FunctionDecl <line:2:1, line:4:1> test 'void (int)'; |-ParmVarDecl <col:11, col:15> col:15 used abc 'int'; `-CompoundStmt <col:20, line:4:1>. With Recovery AST, the AST looks like:. ::. |-FunctionDecl <line:1:1, col:11> NoArg 'int ()'; `-FunctionDecl <line:2:1, line:4:1> test 'void (int)'; |-ParmVarDecl <col:11, col:15> used abc 'int'; `-CompoundStmt <col:20, line:4:1>; `-RecoveryExpr <line:3:3, col:12> 'int' contains-errors; |-UnresolvedLookupExpr <col:3> '<overloaded function type>' lvalue (ADL) = 'NoArg'; `-DeclRefExpr <col:9> 'int' lvalue ParmVar 'abc' 'int'. An alternative is to use existing Exprs, e.g. CallExpr for the above example.; This would capture more call details (e.g. locations of parentheses) and allow; it to be treated uniformly with valid CallExprs. However, jamming the data we; have into CallExpr forces us to weaken its invariants, e.g. arg count may be; wrong. This would introduce a huge burden on consumers of the AST to handle such; ""impossible"" cases. So when we're representing (rather than correcting) errors,; we use a distinct recovery node type with extremely weak invariants instead. ``RecoveryExpr`` is the only recovery node so far.

Explicitly defined registers are normal operands, and can be accessed; with ``MachineInstr::getOperand(int)::getReg()``. In order to check which; registers are implicitly defined by an instruction, use the; ``TargetInstrInfo::get(opcode)::ImplicitDefs``, where ``opcode`` is the opcode; of the target instruction. One important difference between explicit and; implicit physical registers is that the latter are defined statically for each; instruction, whereas the former may vary depending on the program being; compiled.

The direct mapping provides more flexibility to the developer of the register; allocator; however, it is more error prone, and demands more implementation; work.

The drawback; of this approach is that users of your parser have to be aware that they are; using your parser instead of the builtin ones.

For example, we; would like to parse ""102kb"", ""41M"", ""1G"" into the appropriate integer value. In; this case, the underlying data type we want to parse into is '``unsigned``'.

The ``parse`` method is called whenever the option is; invoked, passing in the option itself, the option name, the string to parse, and; a reference to a return value.

The ROOT [reference guide](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/index.html) is moving; to the Doxygen system. Doxygen is the de-facto standard for code documentation. It offers; many nice features we are now exploring and trying to get the best of them. Having; [MathJax rendered math formula](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTSpectrum2.html#a482a7f144b9cc1b0405d0ac0d8cc9bbb); is one of them. The documentation can be structured in a more logical way; [using groups](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/modules.html). Still there is a lot; to do but big progresses have been done. We developed also a Doxygen filter allowing; to execute macros given as examples in the documentation and show the; [resulting picture directly in the documentation](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTHistPainter.html#HP16). ## Tutorials. [The tutorials](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/group__Tutorials.html) in; `$ROOTSYS/tutorials` are also presented on the web thanks to Doxygen. They; are now part of the reference guide allowing nice cross-referencing with the; classes documentation. Here also a filter has been developed to generate; [the resulting picture](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/ContourList_8C.html). ## Build, Configuration and Testing Infrastructure. ROOT uses the CMake cross-platform build-generator tool as a primary build system. CMake does not build the project, it generates the files needed by your build tool (GNU make, Ninja, Visual Studio, etc) for building ROOT. The classic build with configure/make is is still available but it will not be evolving with the new features of ROOT. We added full support for C++14. Minor changes in the build system:. - Renamed build option POSTGRESQL_LIBRARIES to POSTGRESQL_LIBRARY; - Added build option `builtin_openssl` to build OpenSSL internally.

The format of this section is. .. code-block:: none.

FailtKind describes the reason of expected fault. Currently three kind; of faults are supported:. 1. ``FaultMaps::FaultingLoad`` - fault due to load from memory.; 2. ``FaultMaps::FaultingLoadStore`` - fault due to instruction load and store.; 3. ``FaultMaps::FaultingStore`` - fault due to store to memory.

If both histograms have one empty bin, the number of degree of freedom is decreased by one but the test is performed without reporting an error. If only one histogram is having an empty bin it is considered in the comparison. Fixed a bug in preserving the global statistic information after scaling, adding or rebinning the histogram. TH2. Improve TH2::FitFitSliceX and TH2::FitFitSliceY by adding the possibility to return the generated histograms in a TObjArray when the passed pointer is not null. Support also variable bin size histograms. Improve histogram projections. The implementation of TH2::ProjectionX and TH2::ProjectionY has been combined in a single private method. TH3. Fixed a couple of bugs in TH3::Project3DProfile. TProfile and TProfile2D. Add a new option ""W"" in TProfile::ProjectionX and TProfile::ProjectionXY to be able to return the equivalent weighted filled histogram. Its bin content is equal to the profile bin content multiplied by the bin entries. Implement in the TProfile a new option, ""G"" for the bin error.

In this case, any order of that two ``add`` instructions will be allowed. If you are defining `and` using variables in the same ``CHECK-DAG:`` block,; be aware that the definition rule can match `after` its use. So, for instance, the code below will pass:. .. code-block:: text. ; CHECK-DAG: vmov.32 [[REG2:d[0-9]+]][0]; ; CHECK-DAG: vmov.32 [[REG2]][1]; vmov.32 d0[1]; vmov.32 d0[0].

While this can be very useful, it's also dangerous, because in the case of; register sequence, you must have a strong order (read before write, copy before; use, etc). If the definition your test is looking for doesn't match (because; of a bug in the compiler), it may match further away from the use, and mask; real bugs away.

Otherwise, if the ``-output`` option was not specified, ``bugpoint`` runs the; test program with the ""safe"" backend (which is assumed to generate good code) to; generate a reference output. Once ``bugpoint`` has a reference output for the; test program, it tries executing it with the selected code generator. If the; selected code generator crashes, ``bugpoint`` starts the `crash debugger`_ on; the code generator. Otherwise, if the resulting output differs from the; reference output, it assumes the difference resulted from a code generator; failure, and starts the `code generator debugger`_. Finally, if the output of the selected code generator matches the reference; output, ``bugpoint`` runs the test program after all of the LLVM passes have; been applied to it. If its output differs from the reference output, it assumes; the difference resulted from a failure in one of the LLVM passes, and enters the; `miscompilation debugger`_. Otherwise, there is no problem ``bugpoint`` can; debug. .. _crash debugger:. Crash debugger; --------------.

The LLVM; integrated assembler is extremely compatible with GAS, but there are a couple of; minor places where it is more picky, particularly due to outright GAS bugs.; One specific example is that the assembler rejects ambiguous X86 instructions; that don't have suffixes. For example:. asm(""add %al, (%rax)"");; asm(""addw $4, (%rax)"");; asm(""add $4, (%rax)"");.

When the type of expression has an ""external"" bounds annotation, e.g.,; ``__sized_by``, ``__counted_by``, etc., the compiler may report an error on; ``typeof`` if the annotation creates a dependency with another declaration or; variable. For example, the compiler reports an error on ``typeof(p1)`` shown in; the following code because allowing it can potentially create another type; dependent on the parameter ``size`` in a different context (Please note that an; external bounds annotation on a parameter may only refer to another parameter of; the same function). On the other hand, ``typeof(p2)`` works resulting in ``int; *__counted_by(10)``, since it doesn't depend on any other declaration. ..

Similar errors are produced for other input not conforming to the schema. Scalars; =======. YAML scalars are just strings (i.e. not a sequence or mapping). The YAML I/O; library provides support for translating between YAML scalars and specific; C++ types. Built-in types; --------------; The following types have built-in support in YAML I/O:. * bool; * float; * double; * StringRef; * std::string; * int64_t; * int32_t; * int16_t; * int8_t; * uint64_t; * uint32_t; * uint16_t; * uint8_t.

When reading, YAML I/O will validate that the string found; is convertible to that type and error out if not. Unique types; ------------; Given that YAML I/O is trait based, the selection of how to convert your data; to YAML is based on the type of your data. But in C++ type matching, typedefs; do not generate unique type names. That means if you have two typedefs of; unsigned int, to YAML I/O both types look exactly like unsigned int. To; facilitate make unique type names, YAML I/O provides a macro which is used; like a typedef on built-in types, but expands to create a class with conversion; operators to and from the base type. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. LLVM_YAML_STRONG_TYPEDEF(uint32_t, MyFooFlags); LLVM_YAML_STRONG_TYPEDEF(uint32_t, MyBarFlags). This generates two classes MyFooFlags and MyBarFlags which you can use in your; native data structures instead of uint32_t. They are implicitly; converted to and from uint32_t.

Availability,"r Library; ==============================. Introduction; ------------. This directory contains the generic itanium name demangler; library. The main purpose of the library is to demangle C++ symbols,; i.e. convert the string ""_Z1fv"" into ""f()"". You can also use the CRTP; base ManglingParser to perform some simple analysis on the mangled; name, or (in LLVM) use the opaque ItaniumPartialDemangler to query the; demangled AST. Why are there multiple copies of the this library in the source tree?; ---------------------------------------------------------------------. The canonical sources are in libcxxabi/src/demangle and some of the; files are copied to llvm/include/llvm/Demangle. The simple reason for; this comes from before the monorepo, and both [sub]projects need to; demangle symbols, but neither can depend on each other. * libcxxabi needs the demangler to implement __cxa_demangle, which is; part of the itanium ABI spec. * LLVM needs a copy for a bunch of places, and cannot rely on the; system's __cxa_demangle because it a) might not be available (i.e.,; on Windows), and b) may not be up-to-date on the latest language; features. The copy of the demangler in LLVM has some extra stuff that aren't; needed in libcxxabi (ie, the MSVC demangler, ItaniumPartialDemangler),; which depend on the shared generic components. Despite these; differences, we want to keep the ""core"" generic demangling library; identical between both copies to simplify development and testing. If you're working on the generic library, then do the work first in; libcxxabi, then run libcxxabi/src/demangle/cp-to-llvm.sh. This; script takes as an optional argument the path to llvm, and copies the; changes you made to libcxxabi over. Note that this script just; blindly overwrites all changes to the generic library in llvm, so be; careful. Because the core demangler needs to work in libcxxabi, everything; needs to be declared in an anonymous namespace (see; DEMANGLE_NAMESPACE_BEGIN), and you can't introduc",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/include/llvm/Demangle/README.txt:1074,avail,available,1074,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/include/llvm/Demangle/README.txt,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/include/llvm/Demangle/README.txt,1,['avail'],['available']

Here, the named constructor passes an ``Error`` by reference into the actual; constructor, which the constructor can then use to return errors. The; ``ErrorAsOutParameter`` utility sets the ``Error`` value's checked flag on entry; to the constructor so that the error can be assigned to, then resets it on exit; to force the client (the named constructor) to check the error.

This makes the Tree recoverable up to this point in case the program writing the Tree crashes.; Note that the user can also decide to call FlushBaskets and AutoSave in her event loop on the base of the number of events written instead of the number of bytes written.; New function TTree::OptimizeBaskets. void TTree::OptimizeBaskets(Int_t maxMemory, Float_t minComp, Option_t *option). This function may be called after having filled some entries in a Tree; using the information in the existing branch buffers, it will reassign; new branch buffer sizes to optimize time and memory.; The function computes the best values for branch buffer sizes such that; the total buffer sizes is less than maxMemory and nearby entries written; at the same time.; In case the branch compression factor for the data written so far is less; than compMin, the compression is disabled. if option =""d"" an analysis report is printed.; This function may also be called on an existing Tree to figure out the best values; given the information in the Tree header.

Also, the memory footprint is notified; when the session is terminated. The limit in MBs is set by the; environment variable ""ROOTPROOFASSOFT"". An hard limit can be set via the; env ""ROOTPROOFASHARD"" (also in MBs): the process is automatically; killed by the system if it reaches this limit. Envs variables for the; PROOF processes can be set using the directive 'xpd.putenv' in the; xrootd config file.Input dataIntroduce the; concept of 'input data': these are objects that are distributed in; optimal way to the workers, which are available via the input list, but; which are not saved in the TQueryResult object.

It allows to collect elements from possibly non-adjacent lanes of a vector and store them contiguously in memory in one IR operation. It is useful for targets that support compressing store operations and allows vectorizing loops with cross-iteration dependences like in the following example:. .. code-block:: c. // In this loop we load elements from A and store them consecutively in B; double *A, B; int *C;; for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {; if (C[i] != 0); B[j++] = A[i]; }. .. code-block:: llvm. ; Load elements from A.; %Tmp = call <8 x double> @llvm.masked.load.v8f64.p0(ptr %Aptr, i32 8, <8 x i1> %Mask, <8 x double> poison); ; Store all selected elements consecutively in array B; call <void> @llvm.masked.compressstore.v8f64(<8 x double> %Tmp, ptr %Bptr, <8 x i1> %Mask). ; %Bptr should be increased on each iteration according to the number of '1' elements in the Mask.; %MaskI = bitcast <8 x i1> %Mask to i8; %MaskIPopcnt = call i8 @llvm.ctpop.i8(i8 %MaskI); %MaskI64 = zext i8 %MaskIPopcnt to i64; %BNextInd = add i64 %BInd, %MaskI64.

NumVal = strtod(NumStr.c_str(), 0);; return tok_number;; }. This is all pretty straightforward code for processing input. When; reading a numeric value from input, we use the C ``strtod`` function to; convert it to a numeric value that we store in ``NumVal``. Note that; this isn't doing sufficient error checking: it will incorrectly read; ""1.23.45.67"" and handle it as if you typed in ""1.23"". Feel free to; extend it!

We handle comments by skipping to the end of the line and then return; the next token. Finally, if the input doesn't match one of the above; cases, it is either an operator character like '+' or the end of the; file.

Passes; ------. JITLink passes are ``std::function<Error(LinkGraph&)>`` instances. They are free; to inspect and modify the given ``LinkGraph`` subject to the constraints of; whatever phase they are running in (see :ref:`generic_link_algorithm`). If a; pass returns ``Error::success()`` then linking continues. If a pass returns; a failure value then linking is stopped and the ``JITLinkContext`` is notified; that the link failed. Passes may be used by both JITLink backends (e.g. MachO/x86-64 implements GOT; and PLT construction as a pass), and external clients like; ``ObjectLinkingLayer::Plugin``. In combination with the open ``LinkGraph`` API, JITLink passes enable the; implementation of powerful new features.

Masked Vector Expanding Load and Compressing Store Intrinsics; -------------------------------------------------------------. LLVM provides intrinsics for expanding load and compressing store operations. Data selected from a vector according to a mask is stored in consecutive memory addresses (compressed store), and vice-versa (expanding load). These operations effective map to ""if (cond.i) a[j++] = v.i"" and ""if (cond.i) v.i = a[j++]"" patterns, respectively. Note that when the mask starts with '1' bits followed by '0' bits, these operations are identical to :ref:`llvm.masked.store <int_mstore>` and :ref:`llvm.masked.load <int_mload>`. .. _int_expandload:.

The status of major ABI-impacting C++ features:. * Record layout: :good:`Complete`. We've tested this with a fuzzer and have; fixed all known bugs. * Class inheritance: :good:`Mostly complete`. This covers all of the standard; OO features you would expect: virtual method inheritance, multiple; inheritance, and virtual inheritance. Every so often we uncover a bug where; our tables are incompatible, but this is pretty well in hand. This feature; has also been fuzz tested. * Name mangling: :good:`Ongoing`. Every new C++ feature generally needs its own; mangling. For example, member pointer template arguments have an interesting; and distinct mangling. Fortunately, incorrect manglings usually do not result; in runtime errors. Non-inline functions with incorrect manglings usually; result in link errors, which are relatively easy to diagnose. Incorrect; manglings for inline functions and templates result in multiple copies in the; final image. The C++ standard requires that those addresses be equal, but few; programs rely on this. * Member pointers: :good:`Mostly complete`. Standard C++ member pointers are; fully implemented and should be ABI compatible. Both `#pragma; pointers_to_members`_ and the `/vm`_ flags are supported. However, MSVC; supports an extension to allow creating a `pointer to a member of a virtual; base class`_.

A user's own classes can be accessed after loading, either directly or; indirectly, the library that contains the dictionary. One easy way of; obtaining such a library, is by using ACLiC:. ``` {.cpp}; $ cat MyClass.C; class MyClass {; public:. MyClass(int value = 0) {; m_value = value;; }. void SetValue(int value) {; m_value = value;; }. int GetValue() {; return m_value;; }. private:; int m_value;; };. $ echo .L MyClass.C+ | root.exe -b; [...]; Info in <TUnixSystem::ACLiC>: creating shared library [..]/./MyClass_C.so; $; ```. Then you can use it, for example, like so:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import gSystem. # load library with MyClass dictionary; gSystem.Load('MyClass_C'). # get MyClass from ROOT; from ROOT import MyClass; # use MyClass; m = MyClass(42); print(m.GetValue()); ```. You can also load a macro directly, but if you do not use ACLiC, you; will be restricted to use the default constructor of your class, which; is otherwise fully functional. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; from ROOT import gROOT. # load MyClass definition macro (append '+' to use ACLiC); gROOT.LoadMacro('MyClass.C'). # get MyClass from ROOT; from ROOT import MyClass. # use MyClass; m = MyClass(); m.SetValue(42); print(m.GetValue()); ```; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md:32934,echo,echo,32934,documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/PythonRuby.md,1,['echo'],['echo']

This class is concerned; with two very simple jobs: (1) Running every IR Module that is emitted via this; layer through the transform function object, and (2) implementing the ORC; ``IRLayer`` interface (which itself conforms to the general ORC Layer concept,; more on that below). Most of the class is straightforward: a typedef for the; transform function, a constructor to initialize the members, a setter for the; transform function value, and a default no-op transform. The most important; method is ``emit`` as this is half of our IRLayer interface. The emit method; applies our transform to each module that it is called on and, if the transform; succeeds, passes the transformed module to the base layer. If the transform; fails, our emit function calls; ``MaterializationResponsibility::failMaterialization`` (this JIT clients who; may be waiting on other threads know that the code they were waiting for has; failed to compile) and logs the error with the execution session before bailing; out. The other half of the IRLayer interface we inherit unmodified from the IRLayer; class:. .. code-block:: c++.

This code, from ``llvm/lib/ExecutionEngine/Orc/Layer.cpp``, adds a; ThreadSafeModule to a given JITDylib by wrapping it up in a; ``MaterializationUnit`` (in this case a ``BasicIRLayerMaterializationUnit``).; Most layers that derived from IRLayer can rely on this default implementation; of the ``add`` method. These two operations, ``add`` and ``emit``, together constitute the layer; concept: A layer is a way to wrap a part of a compiler pipeline (in this case; the ""opt"" phase of an LLVM compiler) whose API is opaque to ORC with an; interface that ORC can ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT2.rst:8860,error,error,8860,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT2.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT2.rst,1,['error'],['error']

Therefore, errors based on; the M error matrix take account of all the parameter correlations, but; not the non-linearities. That is, from the error matrix alone,; two-standard-deviation errors are always exactly twice as big as; one-standard-deviation errors. When the error matrix has been calculated (for example by the successful; execution of $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (MnMigrad::operator(), see; [api:migradop]) or HESSE (MnHesse::operator())) then the parameter; errors printed by M are the square roots of the diagonal elements of; this matrix. The covariance or the correlations can be printed and shown; via std::cout as the ostream operator operator$<<$ is overloaded. The; eigenvalues of the error matrix can be calculated using MnEigen, which; should all be positive if the matrix is positive-definite (see below on; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ and positive-definiteness). The effect of correlations on the individual parameter errors can be; seen as follows. When parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed (e.g. via the; method MnMigrad::fix(n)), M inverts the error matrix, removes the row; and column corresponding to parameter $\mbox{n}$, and re-inverts the; result. The effect on the errors of the other parameters will in general; be to make them smaller, since the component due to the uncertainty in; parameter $\mbox{n}$ has now been removed. (In the limit that a; given parameter is uncorrelated with parameter $\mbox{n}$, its error; will not change when parameter $\mbox{n}$ is fixed.) However the; procedure is not reversible, since M forgets the original error matrix,; so if parameter $\mbox{n}$ is then released (e.g. via the method; MnMigrad::release(n)), the error matrix is considered as unknown and has; to be recalculated with appropriate commands. ### $\mbox{MINOS}$ errors ###.

The ""basic"" library contains a; number of low-level utilities for tracking and manipulating source buffers,; locations within the source buffers, diagnostics, tokens, target abstraction,; and information about the subset of the language being compiled for. Part of this infrastructure is specific to C (such as the ``TargetInfo``; class), other parts could be reused for other non-C-based languages; (``SourceLocation``, ``SourceManager``, ``Diagnostics``, ``FileManager``).; When and if there is future demand we can figure out if it makes sense to; introduce a new library, move the general classes somewhere else, or introduce; some other solution. We describe the roles of these classes in order of their dependencies. The Diagnostics Subsystem; -------------------------. The Clang Diagnostics subsystem is an important part of how the compiler; communicates with the human. Diagnostics are the warnings and errors produced; when the code is incorrect or dubious. In Clang, each diagnostic produced has; (at the minimum) a unique ID, an English translation associated with it, a; :ref:`SourceLocation <SourceLocation>` to ""put the caret"", and a severity; (e.g., ``WARNING`` or ``ERROR``). They can also optionally include a number of; arguments to the diagnostic (which fill in ""%0""'s in the string) as well as a; number of source ranges that related to the diagnostic. In this section, we'll be giving examples produced by the Clang command line; driver, but diagnostics can be :ref:`rendered in many different ways; <DiagnosticConsumer>` depending on how the ``DiagnosticConsumer`` interface is; implemented. A representative example of a diagnostic is:. .. code-block:: text. t.c:38:15: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('int *' and '_Complex float'); P = (P-42) + Gamma*4;; ~~~~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~.

Error Handling; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Every import function returns with either an ``llvm::Error`` or an; ``llvm::Expected<T>`` object. This enforces to check the return value of the; import functions. If there was an error during one import then we return with; that error. (Exception: when we import the members of a class, we collect the; individual errors with each member and we concatenate them in one Error; object.) We cache these errors in cases of declarations. During the next import; call if there is an existing error we just return with that. So, clients of the; library receive an Error object, which they must check. During import of a specific declaration, it may happen that some AST nodes had; already been created before we recognize an error. In this case, we signal back; the error to the caller, but the ""to"" context remains polluted with those nodes; which had been created. Ideally, those nodes should not had been created, but; that time we did not know about the error, the error happened later. Since the; AST is immutable (most of the cases we can't remove existing nodes) we choose; to mark these nodes as erroneous. We cache the errors associated with declarations in the ""from"" context in; ``ASTImporter::ImportDeclErrors`` and the ones which are associated with the; ""to"" context in ``ASTImporterSharedState::ImportErrors``. Note that, there may; be several ASTImporter objects which import into the same ""to"" context but from; different ""from"" contexts; in this case, they have to share the associated; errors of the ""to"" context. When an error happens, that propagates through the call stack, through all the; dependant nodes.

If you find something interesting, please go ahead and get your hands dirty!; The list is prioritized in descending order:; Extending and improving the multiline input mode - The multiline mode has to figure out automatically whether the user's input is still incomplete. For example ""if (a < 0) {"" is not fully completed input. Cling should'n try to process the line but to be smart enough to understand that it should wait for continuation. Currently cling switches multiline mode only when there is trailing ""{"". It has to be extended to detect trailing +, unbalanced ',"" and so on.; Implementing auto completion - Clang has good interface for autocompletion which proposes possible completion options considering the current input.; Implementing error recovery verifier - One of the most important parts in cling is the error recovery. The error recovery takes care of reverting clang's internal structures on error in the user input. For instance, user types int i; error_here;. int i should be reverted and the entire input should be invalidated. This is very complex because many implicit template instantiations could be triggered and so on. The idea of the future verifier is to serialize the AST with all the lookup structures (probably in pch or pcm), trigger an error causing a lot of things to happen in clang internally and serialize the new AST.

In C++ it might look like:; ```; template<int a, int b>; class C {; int c = a;; int d = b;; };; C<0, 1> X;; ```. If templates aren't your thing, another way to think of them is as parameters to the constructor of a class. . For instance Python code might look like this:; ```; class C(object):; def __init__(self, a, b):; self.c = a; self.d = b. print(C(0, 1).c); # prints ""0""; ```. ```tablegen; class C <int a, int b> {; int c = a;; int d = b;; }; def X: C<0> {}; ```. <stdin>:5:8: error: value not specified for template argument 'C:b'; def X: C<0> {}; ^; <stdin>:1:21: note: declared in 'C'; class C <int a, int b> {; ^. When not enough arguments are provided, you get an error. Below is what happens when one of those arguments is of the wrong type. ```tablegen; class C <int a, int b> {; int c = a;; int d = b;; }; def X: C<0, ""hello""> {}; ```. <stdin>:5:8: error: Value specified for template argument 'C:b' is of type string; expected type int: ""hello""; def X: C<0, ""hello""> {}; ^.

Availability,"re evaluated and lists all the possible; requirements that can be used to construct a refactoring action rule. Refactoring Action Rule Requirements; ------------------------------------. A refactoring action rule requirement is a value whose type derives from the; ``RefactoringActionRuleRequirement`` class. The type must define an; ``evaluate`` member function that returns a value of type ``Expected<...>``.; When a requirement value is used as an argument to; ``createRefactoringActionRule``, that value is evaluated during the initiation; of the action rule. The evaluated result is then passed to the rule's; constructor unless the evaluation produced an error. For example, the; ``DeleteSelectedRange`` sample rule that's defined in the previous section; will be evaluated using the following steps:. #. ``SourceRangeSelectionRequirement``'s ``evaluate`` member function will be; called first. It will return an ``Expected<SourceRange>``. #. If the return value is an error the initiation will fail and the error; will be reported to the client. Note that the client may not report the; error to the user. #. Otherwise the source range return value will be used to construct the; ``DeleteSelectedRange`` rule. The rule will then be invoked as the initiation; succeeded (all requirements were evaluated successfully). The same series of steps applies to any refactoring rule. Firstly, the engine; will evaluate all of the requirements. Then it will check if these requirements; are satisfied (they should not produce an error). Then it will construct the; rule and invoke it. The separation of requirements, their evaluation and the invocation of the; refactoring action rule allows the refactoring clients to:. - Disable refactoring action rules whose requirements are not supported. - Gather the set of options and define a command-line / visual interface; that allows users to input these options without ever invoking the; action.

If you're compiling with GCC, you can use architecture options for your target,; and the compiler driver will detect everything that it needs:. * ``-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-march=armv7-a -mcpu=cortex-a9 -mfloat-abi=hard'``. However, if you're using Clang, the driver might not be up-to-date with your; specific Linux distribution, version or GCC layout, so you'll need to fudge. In addition to the ones above, you'll also need:. * ``--target=arm-linux-gnueabihf`` or whatever is the triple of your cross GCC.; * ``'--sysroot=/usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf'``, ``'--sysroot=/opt/gcc/arm-linux-gnueabihf'``; or whatever is the location of your GCC's sysroot (where /lib, /bin etc are).; * Appropriate use of ``-I`` and ``-L``, depending on how the cross GCC is installed,; and where are the libraries and headers. You may also want to set the ``LLVM_NATIVE_TOOL_DIR`` option - pointing; at a directory with prebuilt LLVM tools (``llvm-tblgen``, ``clang-tblgen``; etc) for the build host, allowing you to them reuse them if available.; E.g. ``-DLLVM_NATIVE_TOOL_DIR=<path-to-native-llvm-build>/bin``.; If the option isn't set (or the directory doesn't contain all needed tools),; the LLVM cross build will automatically launch a nested build to build the; tools that are required. The CXX flags define the target, cpu (which in this case; defaults to ``fpu=VFP3`` with NEON), and forcing the hard-float ABI. If you're; using Clang as a cross-compiler, you will *also* have to set ``--sysroot``; to make sure it picks the correct linker. When using Clang, it's important that you choose the triple to be *identical*; to the GCC triple and the sysroot. This will make it easier for Clang to; find the correct tools and include headers.

Redirecting the; output of scan-build to a text file (make sure to redirect standard; error) is useful for filing bug reports against scan-build or the; analyzer, as we can see the exact options (and files) passed to the analyzer.; For more comprehensible logs, don't perform a parallel build.; Run './configure' through scan-build; If an analyzed project uses an autoconf generated configure script,; you will probably need to run configure script through; scan-build in order to analyze the project.; Example. $ scan-build ./configure; $ scan-build --keep-cc make. The reason configure also needs to be run through; scan-build is because scan-build scans your source files by; interposing on the compiler. This interposition is currently done by; scan-build temporarily setting the environment variable CC to; ccc-analyzer.

The -opt-bisect-limit option can be used with any tool, including front ends; such as clang, that uses the core LLVM library for optimization and code; generation. The exact syntax for invoking the option is discussed below. This feature is not intended to replace other debugging tools such as bugpoint.; Rather it provides an alternate course of action when reproducing the problem; requires a complex build infrastructure that would make using bugpoint; impractical or when reproducing the failure requires a sequence of; transformations that is difficult to replicate with tools like opt and llc. Getting Started; ===============. The -opt-bisect-limit command line option can be passed directly to tools such; as opt, llc and lli. The syntax is as follows:. ::. <tool name> [other options] -opt-bisect-limit=<limit>. If a value of -1 is used the tool will perform all optimizations but a message; will be printed to stderr for each optimization that could be skipped; indicating the index value that is associated with that optimization.

One debugging technique that's proven particularly valuable is to use the; BlockExtractor to extract basic blocks into new functions. This can be used; to track down correctness bugs and can also be used to track down performance; regressions. It can also be coupled with function attributes to disable; GlobalISel for one or more of the extracted functions. .. image:: block-extract.png. The command to do the extraction is:. .. code-block:: shell. ./bin/llvm-extract -o - -S -b ‘foo:bb1;bb4’ <input> > extracted.ll. This particular example extracts two basic blocks from a function named ``foo``.; The new LLVM-IR can then be modified to add the ``failedISel`` attribute to the; extracted function containing bb4 to make that function use SelectionDAG. This can prevent some optimizations as GlobalISel is generally able to work on a; single function at a time. This technique can be repeated for different; combinations of basic blocks until you have identified the critical blocks; involved in a bug. Once the critical blocks have been identified, you can further increase the; resolution to the critical instructions by splitting the blocks like from:. .. code-block:: none. bb1:; ... instructions group 1 ...; ... instructions group 2 ... into:. .. code-block:: none. bb1:; ... instructions group 1 ...; br %bb2. bb2:; ... instructions group 2 ... and then repeating the process for the new blocks. It's also possible to use this technique in a mode where the main function; is compiled with GlobalISel and the extracted basic blocks are compiled with; SelectionDAG (or the other way around) to leverage the existing quality of; another code generator to track down bugs. This technique can also be used to; improve the similarity between fast and slow code when tracking down performance; regressions and help you zero in on a particular cause of the regression.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/Pipeline.rst:6774,down,down,6774,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/Pipeline.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/GlobalISel/Pipeline.rst,2,['down'],['down']

Availability,"return 42 + unknownFunction()``. To model this, we generalize the concept of dependence from C++ templates to; mean dependence on a template parameter or how an error is repaired. The; ``RecoveryExpr`` ``unknownFunction()`` has the totally unknown type; ``DependentTy``, and this suppresses type-based analysis in the same way it; would inside a template. In cases where we are confident about the concrete type (e.g. the return type; for a broken non-overloaded function call), the ``RecoveryExpr`` will have this; type. This allows more code to be typechecked, and produces a better AST and; more diagnostics. For example:. .. code-block:: C++. unknownFunction().size() // .size() is a CXXDependentScopeMemberExpr; std::string(42).size() // .size() is a resolved MemberExpr. Whether or not the ``RecoveryExpr`` has a dependent type, it is always; considered value-dependent, because its value isn't well-defined until the error; is resolved. Among other things, this means that clang doesn't emit more errors; where a RecoveryExpr is used as a constant (e.g. array size), but also won't try; to evaluate it. ContainsErrors bit; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Beyond the template dependence bits, we add a new “ContainsErrors” bit to; express “Does this expression or anything within it contain errors” semantic,; this bit is always set for RecoveryExpr, and propagated to other related nodes.; This provides a fast way to query whether any (recursive) child of an expression; had an error, which is often used to improve diagnostics. .. code-block:: C++. // C++; void recoveryExpr(int abc) {; unknownFunction(); // type-dependent, value-dependent, contains-errors. std::string(42).size(); // value-dependent, contains-errors,; // not type-dependent, as we know the type is std::string; }. .. code-block:: C. // C; void recoveryExpr(int abc) {; unknownVar + abc; // type-dependent, value-dependent, contains-errors; }.

Using different prefixes makes it easier to have separate; ``RUN:`` lines in the same test file which result in differing diagnostic; behavior.

The verifier will recognize ``foo-error`` and ``bar-error`` as special comments; but will not recognize ``expected-error`` as one because the ``-verify`` line; does not contain that as a prefix. Thus, this test would fail verification; because an unexpected diagnostic would appear on the declaration of ``E``. Multiple occurrences accumulate prefixes. For example,; ``-verify -verify=foo,bar -verify=baz`` is equivalent to; ``-verify=expected,foo,bar,baz``. Specifying Diagnostics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Indicating that a line expects an error or a warning is easy.

For a full description of the matching behavior, including more complex; matching scenarios, see :ref:`matching <DiagnosticMatching>` below.

A typical VP; operation takes a vector mask and an explicit vector length parameter as in:. ::. <W x T> llvm.vp.<opcode>.*(<W x T> %x, <W x T> %y, <W x i1> %mask, i32 %evl). The vector mask parameter (%mask) always has a vector of `i1` type, for example; `<32 x i1>`. The explicit vector length parameter always has the type `i32` and; is an unsigned integer value. The explicit vector length parameter (%evl) is in; the range:. ::. 0 <= %evl <= W, where W is the number of vector elements. Note that for :ref:`scalable vector types <t_vector>` ``W`` is the runtime; length of the vector. The VP intrinsic has undefined behavior if ``%evl > W``. The explicit vector; length (%evl) creates a mask, %EVLmask, with all elements ``0 <= i < %evl`` set; to True, and all other lanes ``%evl <= i < W`` to False. A new mask %M is; calculated with an element-wise AND from %mask and %EVLmask:. ::. M = %mask AND %EVLmask. A vector operation ``<opcode>`` on vectors ``A`` and ``B`` calculates:. ::. A <opcode> B = { A[i] <opcode> B[i] M[i] = True, and; { undef otherwise. Optimization Hint; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Some targets, such as AVX512, do not support the %evl parameter in hardware.; The use of an effective %evl is discouraged for those targets. The function; ``TargetTransformInfo::hasActiveVectorLength()`` returns true when the target; has native support for %evl. .. _int_vp_select:.

Note that the merge from ``U2`` to ``Lclang1`` appears redundant, but; if, say, ``U3`` changed some files in upstream clang, the ``Lclang1``; commit appearing after the ``Llld1`` commit would actually represent a; clang tree *earlier* in the upstream clang history. We want the; ``local/zip`` branch to accurately represent the state of our umbrella; history and so the edge ``U2 -> Lclang1`` is a visual reminder of what; clang's tree actually looks like in ``Lclang1``. Even so, the edge ``U3 -> Llld1`` could be problematic for future; merges from upstream. git will think that we've already merged from; ``U3``, and we have, except for the state of the clang tree. One; possible mitigation strategy is to manually diff clang between ``U2``; and ``U3`` and apply those updates to ``local/zip``. Another,; possibly simpler strategy is to freeze local work on downstream; branches and merge all submodules from the latest upstream before; running ``zip-downstream-fork.py``.

The `InheritsFrom` and `IsA`; methods use the extensive Run Time Type Information (RTTI) available via; the ROOT meta-classes. ### Types of Collections. The ROOT system implements the following basic types of collections:; unordered collections, ordered collections and sorted collections. Next; figure shows the inheritance hierarchy for the primary collection; classes. All primary collection classes derive from the abstract base; class **`TCollection`**. ![The inheritance hierarchy of the primary collection classes](pictures/020001A3.jpg). ### Ordered Collections (Sequences). Sequences are collections that are externally ordered because they; maintain internal elements according to the order in which they were; added. The following sequences are available:. - **`TList`**. - **`THashList`**. - **`TOrdCollection`**. - **`TObjArray`**. - **`TClonesArray`**. The **`TOrdCollection`**, **`TObjArray`** as well as the; **`TClonesArray`** can be sorted using their Sort() member function (for; this, the stored objects must provide a comparison function by; overriding TObject::Compare() and also must enable sorting by overriding; TObject::IsSortable() to return true). Ordered collections all derive; from the abstract base class **`TSeqCollection`**. Sorted collections; are ordered by an internal (automatic) sorting mechanism. The following; sorted collections are available (the stored items must be sortable):. - **`TSortedList`**. - **`TBtree`**. Unordered collections don't maintain the order in which the elements; were added, i.e. when you iterate over an unordered collection, you are; not likely to retrieve elements in the same order they were added to the; collection.

Reference to different views of the matrix can be created through the; classes on the right-hand side, see ""Matrix Views"". These references; provide a natural connection to vectors. Matrix decompositions (used in equation solving and matrix inversion); are available through the classes on the left-hand side (see ""Matrix; Decompositions""). They inherit from the **`TDecompBase`** class. The; Eigen Analysis is performed through the classes at the top, see ""Matrix; Eigen Analysis"". In both cases, only some matrix types can be analyzed.; For instance, **`TDecompChol`** will only accept symmetric matrices as; defined **`TMatrixDSym`**. The assignment operator behaves somewhat; different than of most other classes. The following lines will result in; an error:. ``` {.cpp}; TMatrixD a(3,4);; TMatrixD b(5,6);; b = a;; ```. It required to first resize matrix b to the shape of `a`. ``` {.cpp}; TMatrixD a(3,4);; TMatrixD b(5,6);; b.ResizeTo(a);; b = a;; ```. ## Matrix Properties. A matrix has five properties, which are all set in the constructor:. - `precision` - float or double. In the first case you will use the; **`TMatrixF`** class family, in the latter case the **`TMatrixD`**; one;. - `type` - general (**`TMatrixD`**), symmetric (**`TMatrixDSym`**) or; sparse (**`TMatrixDSparse`**);. - `size` - number of rows and columns;. - `index` - range start of row and column index. By default these; start at zero;. - `sparse` `map` - this property is only relevant for a sparse matrix.; It indicates where elements are unequal zero. ### Accessing Properties.

This better reflects the uncertainty of the MC simulations.; This can be reverted as follows:; // C++:; Channel chan(""channel1"");; chan.SetStatErrorConfig( 0.05, ""Gauss"" );; // Within <Channel ... > XML:; <StatErrorConfig RelErrorThreshold=""0.05"" ConstraintType=""Gauss"" />. #### Less verbose HistFactory; HistFactory was very verbose, writing to the terminal with lots of `cout`. Now, many HistFactory messages are going; into RooFit's message stream number 2. The verbosity can therefore be adjusted using; RooMsgService::instance().getStream(2).minLevel = RooFit::PROGRESS;. `hist2workspace` is also much less verbose. The verbosity can be restored with `hist2workspace -v` or `-vv`. ## 2D Graphics Libraries. - Universal time (correct time zone and daylight sav",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md:5208,error,errors,5208,README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v622/index.md,2,['error'],['errors']

Error handling; --------------. Proper error handling helps us identify bugs in our code, and helps end-users; understand errors in their tool usage. Errors fall into two broad categories:; *programmatic* and *recoverable*, with different strategies for handling and; reporting. Programmatic Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Programmatic errors are violations of program invariants or API contracts, and; represent bugs within the program itself. Our aim is to document invariants, and; to abort quickly at the point of failure (providing some basic diagnostic) when; invariants are broken at runtime. The fundamental tools for handling programmatic errors are assertions and the; llvm_unreachable function. Assertions are used to express invariant conditions,; and should include a message describing the invariant:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(isPhysReg(R) && ""All virt regs should have been allocated already."");. The llvm_unreachable function can be used to document areas of control flow; that should never be entered if the program invariants hold:. .. code-block:: c++. enum { Foo, Bar, Baz } X = foo();. switch (X) {; case Foo: /* Handle Foo */; break;; case Bar: /* Handle Bar */; break;; default:; llvm_unreachable(""X should be Foo or Bar here"");; }. Recoverable Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Recoverable errors represent an error in the program's environment, for example; a resource failure (a missing file, a dropped network connection, etc.), or; malformed input. These errors should be detected and communicated to a level of; the program where they can be handled appropriately. Handling the error may be; as simple as reporting the issue t",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:16961,error,errors,16961,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['error'],['errors']

The; search directions determined by $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ are guaranteed to be; downhill only if the covariance matrix is positive–definite, so in case; this is not true, it makes a positive–definite approximation by adding; an appropriate constant along the diagonal as determined by the; eigenvalues of the matrix. Theoretically, the covariance matrix for a; ""physical"" function must be positive–definite at the minimum, although; it may not be so for all points far away from the minimum, even for a; well–determined physical problem. Therefore, if $\mbox{MIGRAD}$; reports that it has found a non-positive–definite covariance matrix,; this may be a sign of one or more of the following:. - **A non–physical region.** On its way to the minimum,; $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ may have traversed a region which has unphysical; behaviour, which is of course not a serious problem as long as it; recovers and leaves such a region. - **An underdetermined problem.** If the matrix is not; positive–definite even at the minimum, this may mean that the; solution is not well–defined, for example that there are more; unknowns than there are data points, or that the parametrization of; the fit contains a linear dependence. If this is the case, then M; (or any other program) cannot solve your problem uniquely, and the; error matrix will necessarily be largely meaningless, so the user; must remove the under-determinedness by reformulating the; parametrization. M cannot do this itself, but it can provide some; hints (contours, global correlation coefficients, eigenvalues) which; can help the clever user to find out what is wrong. - **Numerical inaccuracies.** It is possible that the apparent lack of; positive–definiteness is in fact only due to excessive roundoff; errors in numerical calculations, either in $\mbox{FCN}$ or in",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:72195,recover,recovers,72195,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['recover'],['recovers']

Availability,"rn a matrix, return a TMatrixTLazy object instead. The; conversion is completely transparent to the end user, e.g.; ""TMatrixT m = THaarMatrixT(5);"" and _is_ efficient. Since TMatrixT et al. are fully integrated in %ROOT, they of course; can be stored in a %ROOT database. ### How to efficiently use this package. #### 1. Never return complex objects (matrices or vectors); Danger: For example, when the following snippet:. ~~~ {.cpp}; TMatrixD foo(int n); {; TMatrixD foom(n,n); fill_in(foom); return foom;; }; TMatrixD m = foo(5);; ~~~. runs, it constructs matrix foo:foom, copies it onto stack as a; return value and destroys foo:foom. Return value (a matrix); from foo() is then copied over to m (via a copy constructor),; and the return value is destroyed. So, the matrix constructor is; called 3 times and the destructor 2 times. For big matrices,; the cost of multiple constructing/copying/destroying of objects; may be very large. *Some* optimized compilers can cut down on 1; copying/destroying, but still it leaves at least two calls to; the constructor. Note, TMatrixDLazy (see below) can construct; TMatrixD m ""inplace"", with only a _single_ call to the; constructor. #### 2. Use ""two-address instructions"". ~~~ {.cpp}; void TMatrixD::operator += (const TMatrixD &B);; ~~~. as much as possible.; That is, to add two matrices, it's much more efficient to write. ~~~ {.cpp}; A += B;; ~~~. than. ~~~ {.cpp}; TMatrixD C = A + B;; ~~~. (if both operand should be preserved, `TMatrixD C = A; C += B;`; is still better). #### 3. Use glorified constructors when returning of an object seems inevitable:. ~~~ {.cpp}; TMatrixD A(TMatrixD::kTransposed,B);; TMatrixD C(A,TMatrixD::kTransposeMult,B);; ~~~. like in the following snippet (from `$ROOTSYS/test/vmatrix.cxx`); that verifies that for an orthogonal matrix T, T'T = TT' = E. ~~~ {.cpp}; TMatrixD haar = THaarMatrixD(5);; TMatrixD unit(TMatrixD::kUnit,haar);; TMatrixD haar_t(TMatrixD::kTransposed,haar);; TMatrixD hth(haar,TMatrixD::kTranspos",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/matrix/doc/index.md:15471,down,down,15471,math/matrix/doc/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/matrix/doc/index.md,1,['down'],['down']

Availability,"rning::; Disclaimer: This documentation is written by LLVM project contributors `not`; anyone affiliated with the CMake project. This document may contain; inaccurate terminology, phrasing, or technical details. It is provided with; the best intentions. Introduction; ============. The LLVM project and many of the core projects built on LLVM build using CMake.; This document aims to provide a brief overview of CMake for developers modifying; LLVM projects or building their own projects on top of LLVM. The official CMake language references is available in the cmake-language; manpage and `cmake-language online documentation; <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.4/manual/cmake-language.7.html>`_. 10,000 ft View; ==============. CMake is a tool that reads script files in its own language that describe how a; software project builds. As CMake evaluates the scripts it constructs an; internal representation of the software project. Once the scripts have been; fully processed, if there are no errors, CMake will generate build files to; actually build the project. CMake supports generating build files for a variety; of command line build tools as well as for popular IDEs. When a user runs CMake it performs a variety of checks similar to how autoconf; worked historically. During the checks and the evaluation of the build; description scripts CMake caches values into the CMakeCache. This is useful; because it allows the build system to skip long-running checks during; incremental development. CMake caching also has some drawbacks, but that will be; discussed later. Scripting Overview; ==================. CMake's scripting language has a very simple grammar. Every language construct; is a command that matches the pattern _name_(_args_). Commands come in three; primary types: language-defined (commands implemented in C++ in CMake), defined; functions, and defined macros. The CMake distribution also contains a suite of; CMake modules that contain definitions for useful functionality.

Availability,"roblems, LLVM uses an incremental development style and we; require contributors to follow this practice when making a large/invasive; change. Some tips:. * Large/invasive changes usually have a number of secondary changes that are; required before the big change can be made (e.g. API cleanup, etc). These; sorts of changes can often be done before the major change is done,; independently of that work. * The remaining inter-related work should be decomposed into unrelated sets of; changes if possible. Once this is done, define the first increment and get; consensus on what the end goal of the change is. * Each change in the set can be stand alone (e.g. to fix a bug), or part of a; planned series of changes that works towards the development goal. * Each change should be kept as small as possible. This simplifies your work; (into a logical progression), simplifies code review and reduces the chance; that you will get negative feedback on the change. Small increments also; facilitate the maintenance of a high quality code base. * Often, an independent precursor to a big change is to add a new API and slowly; migrate clients to use the new API. Each change to use the new API is often; ""obvious"" and can be committed without review. Once the new API is in place; and used, it is much easier to replace the underlying implementation of the; API. This implementation change is logically separate from the API; change. If you are interested in making a large change, and this scares you, please make; sure to first `discuss the change/gather consensus`_ then ask about the best way; to go about making the change. Attribution of Changes; ----------------------. When contributors submit a patch to an LLVM project, other developers with; commit access may commit it for the author once appropriate (based on the; progression of code review, etc.). When doing so, it is important to retain; correct attribution of contributions to their contributors. However, we do not; want the source code",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst:28967,mainten,maintenance,28967,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/DeveloperPolicy.rst,1,['mainten'],['maintenance']

This second form is often more readable for functions that involve multiple; ``Expected<T>`` values as it limits the indentation required. If an ``Expected<T>`` value will be moved into an existing variable then the; ``moveInto()`` method avoids the need to name an extra variable. This is; useful to enable ``operator->()`` the ``Expected<T>`` value has pointer-like; semantics. For example:. .. code-block:: c++.

Availability,"roperty allows code that; was not compiled with ``-fsanitize=cfi-icall`` to take a CFI-valid address; of a function, but it comes with a couple of caveats that are especially; relevant for users of cross-DSO CFI:. - There is a performance and code size overhead associated with each; exported function, because each such function must have an associated; jump table entry, which must be emitted even in the common case where the; function is never address-taken anywhere in the program, and must be used; even for direct calls between DSOs, in addition to the PLT overhead. - There is no good way to take a CFI-valid address of a function written in; assembly or a language not supported by Clang. The reason is that the code; generator would need to insert a jump table in order to form a CFI-valid; address for assembly functions, but there is no way in general for the; code generator to determine the language of the function. This may be; possible with LTO in the intra-DSO case, but in the cross-DSO case the only; information available is the function declaration. One possible solution; is to add a C wrapper for each assembly function, but these wrappers can; present a significant maintenance burden for heavy users of assembly in; addition to adding runtime overhead. For these reasons, we provide the option of making the jump table non-canonical; with the flag ``-fno-sanitize-cfi-canonical-jump-tables``. When the jump; table is made non-canonical, symbol table entries point directly to the; function body. Any instances of a function's address being taken in C will; be replaced with a jump table address. This scheme does have its own caveats, however. It does end up breaking; function address equality more aggressively than the default behavior,; especially in cross-DSO mode which normally preserves function address; equality entirely.

Fit methods such as least square, bin and un-bin likelihood are supported.

Recoverable errors represent an error in the program's environment, for example; a resource failure (a missing file, a dropped network connection, etc.), or; malformed input. These errors should be detected and communicated to a level of; the program where they can be handled appropriately. Handling the error may be; as simple as reporting the issue to the user, or it may involve attempts at; recovery. .. note::. While it would be ideal to use this error handling scheme throughout; LLVM, there are places where this hasn't been practical to apply. In; situations where you absolutely must emit a non-programmatic error and; the ``Error`` model isn't workable you can call ``report_fatal_error``,; which will call installed error handlers, print a message, and abort the; program. The use of `report_fatal_error` in this case is discouraged. Recoverable errors are modeled using LLVM's ``Error`` scheme. This scheme; represents errors using function return values, similar to classic C integer; error codes, or C++'s ``std::error_code``. However, the ``Error`` class is; actually a lightweight wrapper for user-defined error types, allowing arbitrary; information to be attached to describe the error. This is similar to the way C++; exceptions allow throwing of user-defined types. Success values are created by calling ``Error::success()``, E.g.:. .. code-block:: c++. Error foo() {; // Do something.; // Return success.; return Error::success();; }. Success values are very cheap to construct and return - they have minimal; impact on program performance. Failure values are constructed using ``make_error<T>``, where ``T`` is any class; that inherits from the ErrorInfo utility, E.g.:. .. code-block:: c++. class BadFileFormat : public ErrorInfo<BadFileFormat> {; public:; static char ID;; std::string Path;.

It also re-uses; concepts and ideas from the CMS; [Common Vector package](Common Vector package). In contrast to CLHEP or; the ROOT physics libraries, `GenVector` provides class templates for; modeling the vectors. The user can control how the vector is internally; represented. This is expressed by a choice of coordinate system, which; is supplied as a template parameter when the vector is constructed.; Furthermore, each coordinate system is itself a template, so that the; user can specify the underlying scalar type.

We try to minimize any overhead in the run-time performance. We have; deliberately avoided the use of any virtual function and even virtual; destructors in the classes. In addition, as much as possible functions; are defined as inline. For this reason, we have chosen to use template; classes to implement the `GenVector` concepts instead of abstract or; base classes and virtual functions. It is then recommended to avoid; using the `GenVector` classes polymorphically and developing classes; inheriting from them. #### Points and Vector Concept. Mathematically vectors and points are two distinct concepts. They have; different transformations, as vectors only rotate while points rotate; and translate. You can add two vectors but not two points and the; difference between two points is a vector.

This should be done only after careful consideration. If any attempt is made to; convert this error to a ``std::error_code`` it will trigger immediate program; termination. Unless you are certain that your errors will not need; interoperability you should look for an existing ``std::error_code`` that you; can convert to, and even (as painful as it is) consider introducing a new one as; a stopgap measure. ``createStringError`` can take ``printf`` style format specifiers to provide a; formatted message:. .. code-block:: c++. createStringError(errc::executable_format_error,; ""Bad executable: %s"", FileName);.

When called, this function; expects that the current token is a '(' token, but after parsing the; subexpression, it is possible that there is no ')' waiting. For example,; if the user types in ""(4 x"" instead of ""(4)"", the parser should emit an; error. Because errors can occur, the parser needs a way to indicate that; they happened: in our parser, we return null on an error. 2) Another interesting aspect of this function is that it uses recursion; by calling ``ParseExpression`` (we will soon see that; ``ParseExpression`` can call ``ParseParenExpr``). This is powerful; because it allows us to handle recursive grammars, and keeps each; production very simple. Note that parentheses do not cause construction; of AST nodes themselves.

Typo correction is a typical; example.; - representing invalid node: the invalid node is preserved in the AST in some; form, e.g. when the ""declaration"" part of the declaration contains semantic; errors, the Decl node is marked as invalid.; - dropping invalid node: this often happens for errors that we don’t have; graceful recovery. Prior to Recovery AST, a mismatched-argument function call; expression was dropped though a CallExpr was created for semantic analysis. With these strategies, clang surfaces better diagnostics, and provides AST; consumers a rich AST reflecting the written source code as much as possible even; for broken code. Recovery AST; ^^^^^^^^^^^^. The idea of Recovery AST is to use recovery nodes which act as a placeholder to; maintain the rough structure of the parsing tree, preserve locations and; children but have no language semantics attached to them. For example, consider the following mismatched function call:. .. code-block:: c++. int NoArg();; void test(int abc) {; NoArg(abc); // oops, mismatched function arguments.; }. Without Recovery AST, the invalid function call expression (and its child; expressions) would be dropped in the AST:. ::. |-FunctionDecl <line:1:1, col:11> NoArg 'int ()'; `-FunctionDecl <line:2:1, line:4:1> test 'void (int)",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:85303,error,errors,85303,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,2,"['error', 'recover']","['errors', 'recovery']"

The ``joinErrors`` routine builds a special error type called ``ErrorList``,; which holds a list of user defined errors. The ``handleErrors`` routine; recognizes this type and will attempt to handle each of the contained errors in; order. If all contained errors can be handled, ``handleErrors`` will return; ``Error::success()``, otherwise ``handleErrors`` will concatenate the remaining; errors and return the resulting ``ErrorList``. Building fallible iterators and iterator ranges; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". The archive walking examples above retrieve archive members by index, however; this requires considerable boiler-plate for iteration and error checking. We can; clean this up by using the ""fallible iterator"" pattern, which supports the; following natural iteration idiom for fallible containers like Archive:. .. code-block:: c++. Error Err = Error::success();; for (auto &Child : Ar->children(Err)) {; // Use Child - only enter the loop when it's valid. // Allow early exit from the loop body, since we know that Err is success; // when we're inside the loop.; if (BailOutOn(Child)); return;. ...; }; // Check Err after the loop to ensure it didn't break due to an error.; if (Err); return Err;. To enable this idiom, iterators over fallible containers are written in a; natural style, with their ``++`` and ``--`` operators replaced with fallible; ``Error inc()`` and ``Error dec()`` functions. E.g.:. .. code-block:: c++. class FallibleChildIterator {; public:; FallibleChildIterator(Archive &A, unsigned ChildIdx);; Archive::Child &operator*();; friend bool operator==(con",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:37055,error,error,37055,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['error'],['error']

Many existing LLVM APIs use ``std::error_code`` and its partner ``ErrorOr<T>``; (which plays the same role as ``Expected<T>``, but wraps a ``std::error_code``; rather than an ``Error``). The infectious nature of error types means that an; attempt to change one of these functions to return ``Error`` or ``Expected<T>``; instead often results in an avalanche of changes to callers, callers of callers,; and so on. (The first such attempt, returning an ``Error`` from; MachOObjectFile's constructor, was abandoned after the diff reached 3000 lines,; impacted half a dozen libraries, and was still growing). To solve this problem, the ``Error``/``std::error_code`` interoperability requirement was; introduced. Two pairs of functions allow any ``Error`` value to be converted to a; ``std::error_code``, any ``Expected<T>`` to be converted to an ``ErrorOr<T>``, and vice; versa:. .. code-block:: c++. std::error_code errorToErrorCode(Error Err);; Error errorCodeToError(std::error_code EC);. template <typename T> ErrorOr<T> expectedToErrorOr(Expected<T> TOrErr);; template <typename T> Expected<T> errorOrToExpected(ErrorOr<T> TOrEC);. Using these APIs it is easy to make surgical patches that update individual; functions from ``std::error_code`` to ``Error``, and from ``ErrorOr<T>`` to; ``Expected<T>``. Returning Errors from error handlers; """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Error recovery attempts may themselves fail. For that reason, ``handleErrors``; actually recognises three different forms of handler signature:. .. code-block:: c++. // Error must be handled, no new errors produced:; void(UserDefinedError &E);. // Error must be handled, new errors can be produced:; Error(UserDefinedError &E);. // Original error can be inspected, then re-wrapped and returned (or a new; // error can be produced):; Error(std::unique_ptr<UserDefinedError> E);.

For example if the file is too large and exceeds; the disk quota, or the job crashes or a batch job reaches its time limit; before the file can be closed. In these cases, it is imperative to; recover and retain as much information as possible. ROOT provides an; intelligent and elegant file recovery mechanism using the redundant; directory information in the record header. If a file that has been not properly closed is opened again, it is; scanned and rebuilt according to the information in the record header.; The recovery algorithm reads the file and creates the saved objects in; memory according to the header information. It then rebuilds the; directory and file structure. If the file is opened in write mode, the; recovery makes the correction on disk when the file is closed; however; if the file is opened in read mode, the correction can not be written to; disk. You can also explicitly invoke the recovery procedure by calling; the `TFile::Recover()` method. You can recover the directory structure,; but you cannot save what you recovered to the file on disk. In the; following example, we interrupted and aborted the previous ROOT session,; causing the file not to be closed.

In order to implement your own importer or exporter, you can inherit; from the corresponding base classes `RooFit::JSONIO::Importer`; or `RooFit::JSONIO::Exporter`, respectively. You can find; [simple examples](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/hs3/src/JSONFactories_RooFitCore.cxx); as well as; [more complicated ones](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/hs3/src/JSONFactories_HistFactory.cxx); in `ROOT`. Any importer should take the following form:. ``` {.cpp}; class MyClassFactory : public RooFit::JSONIO::Importer {; public:; bool importFunction(RooJSONFactoryWSTool *tool, const JSONNode &p) const override; {; std::string name(RooJSONFactoryWSTool::name(p));. // check if the required keys are available in the JSON; if (!p.has_child(""<class member key #1>"")) {; RooJSONFactoryWSTool::error(""missing key '<class member key #1>' of '"" + name + ""'"");; }; if (!p.has_child(""<class member key #2>"")) {; RooJSONFactoryWSTool::error(""missing key '<class member key #2>' of '"" + name + ""'"");; }. std::string member1(p[""<class member key #1>""].val());; int member2(p[""<class member key #2>""].val_int());. MyClass theobj(name.c_str(), member1, member2);; tool->wsImport(theobj);; return true;; }; };; ```. If the class you are trying to import inherits from `RooAbsPdf` rather; than from `RooAbsReal`, you should define `importPdf` instead of; `importFunction`, with the same signature. Once your importer implementation exists, you need to register it with the tool using a line like the following:. ``` {.cpp}; RooFit::JSONIO::registerImporter(""<json key>"", new MyClassFactory(), true);; ```. As there can be several importers for the same `json` key, the last; (boolean) argument determines whether your new importer should be; added at the top of the priority list (`true`) or at the bottom; (`false`). If the import fails, other importers are attempted. The implementation of an exporter works in a very similar fashion:. ``` {.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_hs3.md:5796,error,error,5796,roofit/doc/developers/roofit_hs3.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_hs3.md,1,['error'],['error']

It can be used to express the maximum acceptable error in the; result of that instruction, in ULPs, thus potentially allowing the; compiler to use a more efficient but less accurate method of computing; it. ULP is defined as follows:. If ``x`` is a real number that lies between two finite consecutive; floating-point numbers ``a`` and ``b``, without being equal to one; of them, then ``ulp(x) = |b - a|``, otherwise ``ulp(x)`` is the; distance between the two non-equal finite floating-point numbers; nearest ``x``. Moreover, ``ulp(NaN)`` is ``NaN``.

If; the loaded or returned value is not in the specified range, a poison value is; returned instead. The ranges are represented with a flattened list of integers.; The loaded value or the value returned is known to be in the union of the ranges; defined by each consecutive pair. Each pair has the following properties:. - The type must match the scalar type of the instruction.; - The pair ``a,b`` represents the range ``[a,b)``.; - Both ``a`` and ``b`` are constants.; - The range is allowed to wrap.; - The range should not represent the full ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:284605,error,error,284605,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['error'],['error']

The function to minimize must be given to the class implementing the algorithm as a; `ROOT::Math::IBaseFunctionOneDim` object. ```{.cpp}; ROOT::Math::Functor1D func( [](double x){ return 1 + -4*x + 1*x*x; } );.

The '``shufflevector``' instruction constructs a permutation of elements; from two input vectors, returning a vector with the same element type as; the input and length that is the same as the shuffle mask. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first two operands of a '``shufflevector``' instruction are vectors; with the same type. The third argument is a shuffle mask vector constant; whose element type is ``i32``. The mask vector elements must be constant; integers or ``poison`` values. The result of the instruction is a vector; whose length is the same as the shuffle mask and whose element type is the; same as the element type of the first two operands. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The elements of the two input vectors are numbered from left to right; across both of the vectors. For each element of the result vector, the; shuffle mask selects an element from one of the input vectors to copy; to the result. Non-negative elements in the mask represent an index; into the concatenated pair of input vectors. A ``poison`` element in the mask vector specifies that the resulting element; is ``poison``.; For backwards-compatibility reasons, LLVM temporarily also accepts ``undef``; mask elements, which will be interpreted the same way as ``poison`` elements.; If the shuffle mask selects an ``undef`` element from one of the input; vectors, the resulting element is ``undef``.

When the axis is embedded into a histogram or a graph, one has to first; extract the axis object:. ``` {.cpp}; h->GetXaxis()->SetTitle(""Whatever title you want""); ```. ### Axis Options and Characteristics. The axis options are most simply set with the styles. The available; style options controlling specific axis options are the following:. ``` {.cpp}; TAxis *axis = histo->GetXaxis();; axis->SetAxisColor(Color_t color = 1);; axis->SetLabelColor(Color_t color = 1);; axis->SetLabelFont(Style_t font = 62);; axis->SetLabelOffset(Float_t offset = 0.005);; axis->SetLabelSize(Float_t size = 0.04);; axis->SetNdivisions(Int_t n = 510, Bool_t optim = kTRUE);; axis->SetNoExponent(Bool_t noExponent = kTRUE);; axis->SetTickLength(Float_t length = 0.03);; axis->SetTitleOffset(Float_t offset = 1);; axis->SetTitleSize(Float_t size = 0.02);; ```. The getters corresponding to the described setters are also available.; The general options, not specific to axis, as for instance; `SetTitleTextColor()` are valid and do have an effect on axis; characteristics. ### Setting the Number of Divisions. Use `TAxis::SetNdivisions(ndiv,optim)` to set the number of divisions; for an axis. The `ndiv` and `optim` are as follows:. - `ndiv = N1 + 100*N2 + 10000*N3`. - `N1 =` number of first divisions. - `N2 =` number of secondary divisions. - `N3 =` number of tertiary divisions. - `optim = kTRUE ` (default), the divisions' number will be optimized; around the specified value. - `optim = kFALSE, ` or n \< 0, the axis will be forced to use exactly; n divisions. For example:. `ndiv = 0`: no tick marks. `ndiv = 2`: 2 divisions, one tick mark in the middle of the axis. `ndiv = 510`: 10 primary divisions, 5 secondary divisions. `ndiv = -10`: exactly 10 primary divisions. ### Zooming the Axis.

The association of semantic meaning with color (e.g. red for; errors) is chosen by the code doing the logging, rather than by the UI; presentation of the symbolizing filter. This is a concession to existing code; (e.g. LLVM sanitizer runtimes) that use specific colors and would require; substantial changes to generate semantic markup instead. * A single control sequence changes ""the state"", rather than being an; hierarchical structure that surrounds affected text. The filter processes ANSI SGR control sequences only within a single line.

The conversion from a lambda to a block pointer is only available in; Objective-C++, and not in C++ with blocks, due to its use of Objective-C memory; management (autorelease). Object Literals and Subscripting; --------------------------------. Clang provides support for :doc:`Object Literals and Subscripting; <ObjectiveCLiterals>` in Objective-C, which simplifies common Objective-C; programming patterns, makes programs more concise, and improves the safety of; container creation. There are several feature macros associated with object; literals and subscripting: ``__has_feature(objc_array_literals)`` tests the; availability of array literals; ``__has_feature(objc_dictionary_literals)``; tests the availability of dictionary literals;; ``__has_feature(objc_subscripting)`` tests the availability of object; subscripting.

Availability,"s are immutable (unlike decls). Typedefs in C make semantic analysis a bit more complex than it would be without; them. The issue is that we want to capture typedef information and represent it; in the AST perfectly, but the semantics of operations need to ""see through""; typedefs. For example, consider this code:. .. code-block:: c++. void func() {; typedef int foo;; foo X, *Y;; typedef foo *bar;; bar Z;; *X; // error; **Y; // error; **Z; // error; }. The code above is illegal, and thus we expect there to be diagnostics emitted; on the annotated lines. In this example, we expect to get:. .. code-block:: text. test.c:6:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); *X; // error; ^~; test.c:7:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); **Y; // error; ^~~; test.c:8:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); **Z; // error; ^~~. While this example is somewhat silly, it illustrates the point: we want to; retain typedef information where possible, so that we can emit errors about; ""``std::string``"" instead of ""``std::basic_string<char, std:...``"". Doing this; requires properly keeping typedef information (for example, the type of ``X``; is ""``foo``"", not ""``int``""), and requires properly propagating it through the; various operators (for example, the type of ``*Y`` is ""``foo``"", not; ""``int``""). In order to retain this information, the type of these expressions; is an instance of the ``TypedefType`` class, which indicates that the type of; these expressions is a typedef for ""``foo``"". Representing types like this is great for diagnostics, because the; user-specified type is always immediately available. There are two problems; with this: first, various semantic checks need to make judgements about the; *actual structure* of a type, ignoring typedefs. Second, we need an efficient; way to query whether two types are structurally identical to each other,; ignoring typedefs. The solution to both of these problems is the ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:62578,error,errors,62578,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['error'],['errors']

Availability,"s fairly common to see a definition such as the following copy-and-pasted throughout the headers:. .. parsed-literal::. #ifndef _SIZE_T; #define _SIZE_T; typedef __SIZE_TYPE__ size_t;; #endif. Unfortunately, when modules compiles all of the C library headers together into a single module, only the first actual type definition of ``size_t`` will be visible, and then only in the submodule corresponding to the lucky first header. Any other headers that have copy-and-pasted versions of this pattern will *not* have a definition of ``size_t``. Importing the submodule corresponding to one of those headers will therefore not yield ``size_t`` as part of the API, because it wasn't there when the header was parsed. The fix for this problem is either to pull the copied declarations into a common header that gets included everywhere ``size_t`` is part of the API, or to eliminate the ``#ifndef`` and redefine the ``size_t`` type. The latter works for C++ headers and C11, but will cause an error for non-modules C90/C99, where redefinition of ``typedefs`` is not permitted. **Conflicting definitions**; Different system headers may provide conflicting definitions for various macros, functions, or types. These conflicting definitions don't tend to cause problems in a pre-modules world unless someone happens to include both headers in one translation unit. Since the fix is often simply ""don't do that"", such problems persist. Modules requires that the conflicting definitions be eliminated or that they be placed in separate modules (the former is generally the better answer). **Missing includes**; Headers are often missing ``#include`` directives for headers that they actually depend on. As with the problem of conflicting definitions, this only affects unlucky users who don't happen to include headers in the right order. With modules, the headers of a particular module will be parsed in isolation, so the module may fail to build if there are missing includes. **Headers that vend multiple ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:53999,error,error,53999,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,1,['error'],['error']

There is ongoing work to support C++ standard libraries from `LLVM's libcxx; <https://libcxx.llvm.org/>`_ in OpenCL kernel code using C++ for OpenCL mode. It is currently possible to include `type_traits` from C++17 in the kernel; sources when the following clang extensions are enabled; ``__cl_clang_function_pointers`` and ``__cl_clang_variadic_functions``,; see :doc:`LanguageExtensions` for more details. The use of non-conformant; features enabled by the extensions does not expose non-conformant behavior; beyond the compilation i.e. does not get generated in IR or binary.; The extension only appear in metaprogramming; mechanism to identify or verify the properties of types. This allows to provide; the full C++ functionality without a loss of portability. To avoid unsafe use; of the extensions it is recommended that the extensions are disabled directly; after the header include. **Example of Use**:. The example of kernel code with `type_traits` is illustrated here. .. code-block:: c++. #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION __cl_clang_function_pointers : enable; #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION __cl_clang_variadic_functions : enable; #include <type_traits>; #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION __cl_clang_function_pointers : disable; #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION __cl_clang_variadic_functions : disable. using sint_type = std::make_signed<unsigned int>::type;. __kernel void foo() {; static_assert(!std::is_same<sint_type, unsigned int>::value);; }. The possible clang invocation to compile the example is as follows:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -I<path to libcxx checkout or installation>/include test.clcpp. Note that `type_traits` is a header only library and therefore no extra; linking step against the standard libraries is required.

Availability,"s found a; non-positive-definite covariance matrix, this may be a sign of one or; more of the following:. #### A Non-physical Region. On its way to the minimum, `MIGRAD` may have traversed a region that; has unphysical behavior, which is of course not a serious problem as; long as it recovers and leaves such a region. #### An Underdetermined Problem. If the matrix is not positive-definite even at the minimum, this may; mean that the solution is not well defined, for example that there are; more unknowns than there are data points, or that the parameterization; of the fit contains a linear dependence. If this is the case, then; `Minuit` (or any other program) cannot solve your problem uniquely.; The error matrix will necessarily be largely meaningless, so the user; must remove the under determinedness by reformulating the; parameterization. `Minuit` cannot do this itself. #### Numerical Inaccuracies. It is possible that the apparent lack of positive-definiteness is due; to excessive round off errors in numerical calculations (in the user; function), or not enough precision. This is unlikely in general, but; becomes more likely if the number of free parameters is very large, or; if the parameters are badly scaled (not all of the same order of; magnitude), and correlations are large. In any case, whether the; non-positive-definiteness is real or only numerical is largely; irrelevant, since in both cases the error matrix will be unreliable; and the minimum suspicious. #### An Ill-posed Problem. For questions of parameter dependence, see the discussion above on; positive-definiteness. Possible other mathematical problems are the; following:. - Excessive numerical round off - be especially careful of; exponential and factorial functions which get big very quickly and; lose accuracy. - Starting too far from the solution - the function may have; unphysical local minima, especially at infinity in some variables. ## Minuit2 Package. `Minuit2` is a new object-oriented implement",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:63659,error,errors,63659,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['error'],['errors']

Multiple different use cases (e.g. definitions; of what are observables vs parameters) can be cached; simultaneously. Now it is also possible to specify that p.d.f.s; should be sampled and cached in one or more parameter dimensions; in addition to the automatically determined set of observables.; as well. Also a complete new line of classes with similar functionality has been added inheriting from RooAbsReal.; These are RooAbsCachedReal,RooAbsSelfCachedReal and RooCachedReal. A newly; added class RooHistFunc presents these shapes and is capable of handling negative entries. New PDF error handling structure. New infrastructure has been put into place to propagate and process p.d.f evaluation errors during fitting.; Previously evaluation errors were marked with a zero p.d.f value and propagated as a special condition; in RooAddPdf, RooProdPdf etc to result in a zero top-level p.d.f value that was caught by the RooFit minuit; interface as a special condition.

Before 6.26, it was possible to still use the `RooMinuit` by passing the `Minimizer(""OldMinuit"", ""minimizer"")` command argument to `RooAbsPdf::fitTo()`. This option is now removed. ### Increase of the `RooAbsArg` class version. The class version of `RooAbsArg` was incremented from 7 to 8 in this release. In some circumstances, this can cause warnings in `TStreamerInfo` for classes inheriting from `RooAbsArg` when reading; older RooFit models from a file. These warnings are harmless and can be avoided by incrementing also the class version of the inheriting class. ### Compile-time protection against creating empty `RooCmdArg`s from strings. The implicit [RooCmdArg](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooCmdArg.html) constructor from `const char*` was removed to avoid the accidental construction of meaningless RooCmdArgs that only have a name but no payload.; This causes new compiler errors in your code if you pass a string instead of a RooCmdArg to various RooFit functions, such as [RooAbsPdf::fitTo()](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooAbsPdf.html#a5f79f16f4a26a19c9e66fb5c080f59c5).; If this happens, please consult the documentation of [fitTo()](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classRooAbsPdf.html#a5f79f16f4a26a19c9e66fb5c080f59c5) to check which of the [free functions in the `RooFit` namespace](https://root.cern/doc/v626/group__CmdArgs.html) you need to use to achieve the desired configuration. **Example** of an error that is now caught at compile time: confusing the [RooAbsPdf::fitTo()]() function signature with the one of [TH1::Fit()](https://root.cern/doc/v626/classTH1.html#a63eb028df86bc86c8e20c989eb23fb2a) and passing the fit range name as a string literal:. ```C++; pdf.fitTo(*data, ""r""); // ERROR!; // Will not compile anymore, as `""r""` is not a recognized command and will be ignored!; // Instead, to restrict to a range called ""r"", use:; pdf.fitTo(*data, RooFit::Range(""r""));; ```. ## TMVA. ### SOFIE : Code generatio",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md:31411,error,errors,31411,README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/README/ReleaseNotes/v626/index.md,1,['error'],['errors']

Availability,"s it ""falls"" through the DAG. If a function's basic block graph is a DAG, then block masses are valid block; frequencies. This works poorly in practice though, since downstream users rely; on adding block frequencies together without hitting the maximum. Loop Scale; ==========. Loop scale is a metric that indicates how many times a loop iterates per entry.; As mass is distributed through the loop's DAG, the (otherwise ignored) backedge; mass is collected. This backedge mass is used to compute the exit frequency,; and thus the loop scale. Implementation: Getting from mass and scale to frequency; ========================================================. After analysing the complete series of DAGs, each block has a mass (local to; its containing loop, if any), and each loop pseudo-node has a loop scale and; its own mass (from its parent's DAG). We can get an initial frequency assignment (with entry frequency of 1.0) by; multiplying these masses and loop scales together. A given block's frequency; is the product of its mass, the mass of containing loops' pseudo nodes, and the; containing loops' loop scales. Since downstream users need integers (not floating point), this initial; frequency assignment is shifted as necessary into the range of ``uint64_t``. Block Bias; ==========. Block bias is a proposed *absolute* metric to indicate a bias toward or away; from a given block during a function's execution. The idea is that bias can be; used in isolation to indicate whether a block is relatively hot or cold, or to; compare two blocks to indicate whether one is hotter or colder than the other. The proposed calculation involves calculating a *reference* block frequency,; where:. * every branch weight is assumed to be 1 (i.e., every branch probability; distribution is even) and. * loop scales are ignored. This reference frequency represents what the block frequency would be in an; unbiased graph. The bias is the ratio of the block frequency to this reference block frequency.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst:3791,down,downstream,3791,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BlockFrequencyTerminology.rst,1,['down'],['downstream']

We gain buffer-overflow and buffer-underflow detection through these guard; pages. When a memory access overruns the allocated buffer, it will touch the; inaccessible guard page, causing memory exception. This exception is caught and; handled by the internal crash handler. Because each allocation is recorded with; metadata about where (and by what thread) it was allocated and deallocated, we; can provide information that will help identify the root cause of the bug. Allocations are randomly selected to be either left- or right-aligned to provide; equal detection of both underflows and overflows. Use after Free Detection; ------------------------. The guarded allocation pool also provides use-after-free detection. Whenever a; sampled allocation is deallocated, we map its guarded slot as inaccessible. Any; memory accesses after deallocation will thus trigger the crash handler, and we; can provide useful information about the source of the error. Please note that the use-after-free detection for a sampled allocation is; transient. To keep memory overhead fixed while still detecting bugs, deallocated; slots are randomly reused to guard future allocations. Usage; =====.

The RField class hierarchy is fixed and not meant to be extended by user classes. ### RField::RValue; The `RValue` class makes the connection between an object in memory and the corresponding field used for I/O.; It contains a shared pointer of the object, i.e. RNTuple and the application share ownership of objects.; The object in an RValue can either be created by an RNTuple field (cf. `RField<T>::CreateValue()` method); or provided by the application (cf. `RField<T>::BindValue()` method).; Raw pointers can be passed with the understanding that the raw pointer is owned by the application and are kept alive during I/O operations. `RValue` objects can only be created from fields, and they are linked to their originating field. ### RNTupleModel; The RNTupleModel represents a data schema as a tree of fields.; The model owns its fields.; A model undergoes the following possible state transitions:; ```; [*] ---> Building / --> Frozen --; Updating | |; ^ | |; |------------- v; ----------------->[*]; ```; During the building/updating phase, new top-level fields are added to the model.; Frozen models can create entries.; Every model has a unique model ID, which is used to identify the entries created from this model.; Unless a model is created as ""bare model"", it owns a default entry that is used by default by the `RNTupleReader` and the `RNTupleWriter`.

If you pass a tree, `MyClass` will use it rather; than the tree from which it was created. - `void Init(TTree *tree) -` it is called by the constructor to; initialize the tree for reading. It associates each branch with the; corresponding leaf data member. - `~MyClass() - `the destructor, nothing special. - `Int_t GetEntry(Int_t entry) -` it loads the class with the entry; specified. Once you have executed `GetEntry`, the leaf data members; in `MyClass` are set to the values of the entry. For example,; `GetEntry(12)` loads the 13th event into the event data member of; `MyClass` (note that the first entry is 0). `GetEntry` returns the; number of bytes read from the file. In case the same entry is read; twice, ROOT does not have to do any I/O. In this case `GetEntry`; returns 1. It does not return 0, because many people assume a return; of 0 means an error has occurred while reading. - `Int_t LoadTree(Int_t entry)` and `void Notify()` - these two; methods are related to chains. `LoadTree` will load the tree; containing the specified entry from a chain of trees. Notify is; called by `LoadTree` to adjust the branch addresses. - `void Loop()` - it is the skeleton method that loops through each; entry of the tree. This is interesting to us, because we will need; to customize it for our analysis. ### MyClass.C. `MyClass::Loop` consists of a for-loop calling `GetEntry` for each; entry.

The name of the user's class to implement the FCNBase interface may be; chosen freely (in documentation we give it the generic name; $\mbox{FCN}$). ### FCNBase::operator()(const std::vector$<$double$>$&) ###. The meaning of the vector of parameters std::vector$<$double$>$ in the; argument of FCNBase::operator() are of course defined by the user, who; uses the values of those parameters to calculate their function value. The; order and the position of these parameters is strictly the one specified; by the user when supplying the starting values for minimization. The starting values must be specified by the user, either via an; std::vector$<$double$>$ or the MnUserParameters (see [api:parameters]); supplied as input to the M minimizers such as VariableMetricMinimizer or; MnMigrad (see [api:migrad]). Later values are determined by M as it; searches for the minimum or performs whatever analysis is requested by; the user. ### FCNBase::up() ###. [howto:errordef] Returns the value of $\mbox{up}$ (default value; $= 1.$), defining parameter errors. M defines parameter errors as the; change in parameter value required to change the function value by; $\mbox{up}$. Normally, for chisquared fits $\mbox{up = 1}$, and; for negative log likelihood, $\mbox{up = 0.5}$. ### $\mbox{FCN}$ function with gradient ###. By default first derivatives are calculated numerically by M . In case; the user wants to supply their own gradient calculator (e.g. analytical; derivatives), they need to implement the FCNGradientBase interface. ![](figures/fcngradientbase.png). The size of the output vector is the same as of the input one. The same; is true for the position of the elements (first derivative of the; function with respect to the $n_\mathrm{th}$ variable has index $n$ in; the output vector). ## M parameters ##.

Availability,"s possible to implement this interface in many different ways. For; example, the normal Clang ``DiagnosticConsumer`` (named; ``TextDiagnosticPrinter``) turns the arguments into strings (according to the; various formatting rules), prints out the file/line/column information and the; string, then prints out the line of code, the source ranges, and the caret.; However, this behavior isn't required. Another implementation of the ``DiagnosticConsumer`` interface is the; ``TextDiagnosticBuffer`` class, which is used when Clang is in ``-verify``; mode. Instead of formatting and printing out the diagnostics, this; implementation just captures and remembers the diagnostics as they fly by.; Then ``-verify`` compares the list of produced diagnostics to the list of; expected ones. If they disagree, it prints out its own output. Full; documentation for the ``-verify`` mode can be found at; :ref:`verifying-diagnostics`. There are many other possible implementations of this interface, and this is; why we prefer diagnostics to pass down rich structured information in; arguments. For example, an HTML output might want declaration names be; linkified to where they come from in the source. Another example is that a GUI; might let you click on typedefs to expand them. This application would want to; pass significantly more information about types through to the GUI than a; simple flat string. The interface allows this to happen. .. _internals-diag-translation:.

During some template calls, implicit conversion is not allowed, giving; preference to new instantiations (as is the case in C++).; If, however, a previously instantiated overload is available and would match; with promotion, it is preferred over a (costly) new instantiation, unless a; template overload is explicitly selected using template arguments.; For example:. .. code-block:: python. >>> cppyy.cppdef(r""""""\; ... template<typename T>; ...

If it is important that a specific overload is selected, then use the; ``__overload__`` method to match a specific function signature.; An optional boolean second parameter can be used to restrict the selected; method to be const (if ``True``) or non-const (if ``False``).; The return value of which is a first-class callable obj",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/functions.rst:8204,avail,available,8204,bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/functions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/bindings/pyroot/cppyy/cppyy/doc/source/functions.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

Even so, the edge ``U3 -> Llld1`` could be problematic for future; merges from upstream. git will think that we've already merged from; ``U3``, and we have, except for the state of the clang tree. One; possible mitigation strategy is to manually diff clang between ``U2``; and ``U3`` and apply those updates to ``local/zip``. Another,; possibly simpler strategy is to freeze local work on downstream; branches and merge all submodules from the latest upstream before; running ``zip-downstream-fork.py``.

If no; mitigating adjective is given in the printout of the errors, then at; least M believes the errors are accurate, although there is always a; small chance that M has been fooled. Some visible signs that M may have; been fooled are:. - Warning messages produced during the minimization or error analysis. - Failure to find new minimum. - Value of $\mbox{EDM}$ too big. For a ""normal"" minimization,; after $\mbox{MIGRAD}$, the value of $\mbox{EDM}$ is usually; more than three orders of magnitude smaller than $\mbox{up}$,; unless a looser tolerance has been specified. - Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some; parameters are known to be uncorrelated with the others. - Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99).\; This indicates both an exceptionally difficult problem, and one; which has been badly parametrized so that individual errors are not; very meaningful because they are so highly correlated. - Parameter at limit. This condition, signalled by a M warning; message, may make both the function minimum and parameter errors; unreliable. See section [answer:right-errors], *Getting the right; parameter errors with limits*. The best way to be absolutely sure of the errors, is to use; ""independent"" calculations and compare them, or compare the calculated; errors with a picture of the function if possible. For example, if there; is only one free parameter, $\mbox{SCAN}$ allows the user to verify; approximately the function curvature. Similarly, if there are only two; free parameters, use $\mbox{CONTOURS}$. To verify a full error; matrix, compare the results of $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ with those; (calculated afterward) by $\mbox{HESSE}$, which uses a different; method.

Availability,"s strictly an implementation detail. The interface; provided by the Support Library must be implemented on all platforms (even; those without ``stat``). No Exposed Data; ---------------. Any data defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``) must; not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header file; for that function is not exposed. As with functions, this prevents inadvertent; use of data that might not exist on all platforms. Minimize Soft Errors; --------------------. Operating system interfaces will generally provide error results for every; little thing that could go wrong. In almost all cases, you can divide these; error results into two groups: normal/good/soft and abnormal/bad/hard. That is,; some of the errors are simply information like ""file not found"", ""insufficient; privileges"", etc. while other errors are much harder like ""out of space"", ""bad; disk sector"", or ""system call interrupted"". We'll call the first group ""*soft*""; errors and the second group ""*hard*"" errors. ``lib/Support`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors. This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``.

We track certain versions of software that are *known* to fail when used as; part of the host toolchain. These even include linkers at times. **GNU ld 2.16.X**. Some 2.16.X versions of the ld linker will produce very long; warning messages complaining that some ""``.gnu.linkonce.t.*``"" symbol was; defined in a discarded section. You can safely ignore these messages as they are; erroneous and the linkage is correct. These messages disappear using ld 2.17. **GNU binutils 2.17**: Binutils 2.17 contains `a bug; <http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3111>`__ which causes huge link; times (minutes instead of seconds) when building LLVM. We recommend upgrading; to a newer version (2.17.50.0.4 or later). **GNU Binutils 2.19.1 Gold**: This version of Gold contained `a bug; <http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9836>`__ which causes; intermittent failures when building LLVM with position independent code. The; symptom is an error about cyclic dependencies. We recommend upgrading to a; newer version of Gold. Getting a Modern Host C++ Toolchain; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

FreeBSD 10.0 and newer; have a modern Clang as the system compiler. However, some Linux distributions and some other or older BSDs sometimes have; extremely old versions of GCC. These steps attempt to help you upgrade you; compiler even on such a system.

Availability,"s the JIT know about sin and cos? The answer is surprisingly; simple: The KaleidoscopeJIT has a straightforward symbol resolution rule that; it uses to find symbols that aren't available in any given module: First; it searches all the modules that have already been added to the JIT, from the; most recent to the oldest, to find the newest definition. If no definition is; found inside the JIT, it falls back to calling ""``dlsym(""sin"")``"" on the; Kaleidoscope process itself. Since ""``sin``"" is defined within the JIT's; address space, it simply patches up calls in the module to call the libm; version of ``sin`` directly. But in some cases this even goes further:; as sin and cos are names of standard math functions, the constant folder; will directly evaluate the function calls to the correct result when called; with constants like in the ""``sin(1.0)``"" above. In the future we'll see how tweaking this symbol resolution rule can be used to; enable all sorts of useful features, from security (restricting the set of; symbols available to JIT'd code), to dynamic code generation based on symbol; names, and even lazy compilation. One immediate benefit of the symbol resolution rule is that we can now extend; the language by writing arbitrary C++ code to implement operations. For example,; if we add:. .. code-block:: c++. #ifdef _WIN32; #define DLLEXPORT __declspec(dllexport); #else; #define DLLEXPORT; #endif. /// putchard - putchar that takes a double and returns 0.; extern ""C"" DLLEXPORT double putchard(double X) {; fputc((char)X, stderr);; return 0;; }. Note, that for Windows we need to actually export the functions because; the dynamic symbol loader will use ``GetProcAddress`` to find the symbols. Now we can produce simple output to the console by using things like:; ""``extern putchard(x); putchard(120);``"", which prints a lowercase 'x'; on the console (120 is the ASCII code for 'x'). Similar code could be; used to implement file I/O, console input, and many other capabilities;",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl04.rst:23612,avail,available,23612,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl04.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl04.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"s they are needed. Types have a couple of non-obvious; features: 1) they do not capture type qualifiers like ``const`` or ``volatile``; (see :ref:`QualType <QualType>`), and 2) they implicitly capture typedef; information. Once created, types are immutable (unlike decls). Typedefs in C make semantic analysis a bit more complex than it would be without; them. The issue is that we want to capture typedef information and represent it; in the AST perfectly, but the semantics of operations need to ""see through""; typedefs. For example, consider this code:. .. code-block:: c++. void func() {; typedef int foo;; foo X, *Y;; typedef foo *bar;; bar Z;; *X; // error; **Y; // error; **Z; // error; }. The code above is illegal, and thus we expect there to be diagnostics emitted; on the annotated lines. In this example, we expect to get:. .. code-block:: text. test.c:6:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); *X; // error; ^~; test.c:7:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); **Y; // error; ^~~; test.c:8:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); **Z; // error; ^~~. While this example is somewhat silly, it illustrates the point: we want to; retain typedef information where possible, so that we can emit errors about; ""``std::string``"" instead of ""``std::basic_string<char, std:...``"". Doing this; requires properly keeping typedef information (for example, the type of ``X``; is ""``foo``"", not ""``int``""), and requires properly propagating it through the; various operators (for example, the type of ``*Y`` is ""``foo``"", not; ""``int``""). In order to retain this information, the type of these expressions; is an instance of the ``TypedefType`` class, which indicates that the type of; these expressions is a typedef for ""``foo``"". Representing types like this is great for diagnostics, because the; user-specified type is always immediately available.

For example if you would like to run a script `myMacro.C` in the; background, redirect the output into a file `myMacro.log`, and exit; after the script execution, use the following syntax:. ```; root -b -q myMacro.C > myMacro.log; ```. If you need to pass a parameter to the script use:. ```; root -b -q 'myMacro.C(3)' > myMacro.log; ```. Be mindful of the quotes, i.e. if you need to pass a string as a; parameter, the syntax is:. ```; root -b -q 'myMacro.C(""text"")' > myMacro.log; ```. You can build a shared library with ACLiC and then use this shared; library on the command line for a quicker execution (i.e. the compiled; speed rather than the interpreted speed). See also ""Cling the C++; Interpreter"". ```; root -b -q myMacro.so > myMacro.log; ```. ROOT has a powerful C/C++ interpreter giving you access to all available; ROOT classes, global variables, and functions via the command line. By; typing C++ statements at the prompt, you can create objects, call; functions, execute scripts, etc. For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] 1+sqrt(9); (const double)4.00000000000000000e+00; root[] for (int i = 0; i<4; i++) cout << ""Hello"" << i << endl; Hello 0; Hello 1; Hello 2; Hello 3; root[] .q; ```.

Here we would like to thank our main co-developers and; contributors:. **Masaharu Goto** wrote the C++ interpreter CINT that was an; essential part of ROOT before ROOT 6. Despite being 8 time zones ahead; of us, we have the feeling he has been sitting in the room next door; since 1995. **Andrei** and **Mihaela Gheata** (Alice collaboration) are co-authors; of the ROOT geometry classes and Virtual Monte-Carlo. They have been; working with the ROOT team since 2000. **Olivier Couet**, who after a successful development and maintenance; of PAW, has joined the ROOT team in 2000 and has been working on the; graphics sub-system. **Ilka Antcheva** has been working on the Graphical User Interface; classes.

The operation may be conditional, when not all bits in the mask are switched on. It is useful for targets that support vector masked scatter and allows vectorizing basic blocks with data and control divergence. Other targets may support this intrinsic differently, for example by lowering it into a sequence of branches that guard scalar store operations. ::. ;; This instruction unconditionally stores data vector in multiple addresses; call @llvm.masked.scatter.v8i32.v8p0(<8 x i32> %value, <8 x ptr> %ptrs, i32 4, <8 x i1> <true, true, .. true>). ;; It is equivalent to a list of scalar stores; %val0 = extractelement <8 x i32> %value, i32 0; %val1 = extractelement <8 x i32> %value, i32 1; ..; %val7 = extractelement <8 x i32> %value, i32 7; %ptr0 = extractelement <8 x ptr> %ptrs, i32 0; %ptr1 = extractelement <8 x ptr> %ptrs, i32 1; ..; %ptr7 = extractelement <8 x ptr> %ptrs, i32 7; ;; Note: the order of the following stores is important when they overlap:; store i32 %val0, ptr %ptr0, align 4; store i32 %val1, ptr %ptr1, align 4; ..; store i32 %val7, ptr %ptr7, align 4.

Default settings for iteration cycles and; tolerances are initialized then. The default setting is set for medium; quality. Value 0 (low) indicates to M that it should economize function; calls; it is intended for cases where there are many variable parameters; and/or the function takes a long time to calculate and/or the user is; not interested in very precise values for parameter errors. On the other; hand, value 2 (high) indicates that M is allowed to waste function calls; in order to be sure that all values are precise; it is intended for; cases where the function is evaluated in a relatively short time and/or; where the parameter errors must be calculated reliably. In addition all; constants set in MnStrategy can be changed individually by the user,; e.g. the number of iteration cycles in the numerical gradient. ## Parameter errors ##. M is usually used to find the ""best"" values of a set of parameters,; where ""best"" is defined as those values which minimize a given function,; $\mbox{FCN}$. The width of the function minimum, or more generally,; the shape of the function in some neighbourhood of the minimum, gives; information about the *uncertainty* in the best parameter values, often; called by physicists the *parameter errors*. An important feature of M; is that it offers several tools to analyze the parameter errors. ### $\mbox{FCN}$ normalization and the error definition ###. Whatever method is used to calculate the parameter errors, they will; depend on the overall (multiplicative) normalization of; $\mbox{FCN}$, in the sense that if the value of $\mbox{FCN}$ is; everywhere multiplied by a constant $\beta$, then the errors will be; decreased by a factor $\sqrt{\beta}$.

In many cases clang can successfully; use this multiarch support when ``--gcc-toolchain=`` and ``--sysroot=`` are not supplied.; Unfortunately clang adds ``/usr/local/include`` before; ``/usr/include/arm-linux-gnueabihf`` leading to errors when compiling the hosts; header files. The multiarch support is not sufficient to build the builtins you will need to; use a separate arm-linux-gnueabihf toolchain. No target passed to clang; -------------------------; If clang is not given a target it will typically use the host target, this will; not understand the Arm assembly language files resulting in error messages such; as ``error: unknown directive .syntax unified``. You can check the clang invocation in the error message to see if there is no; ``--target`` or if it is set incorrectly. The cause is usually; ``CMAKE_ASM_FLAGS`` not containing ``--target`` or ``CMAKE_ASM_COMPILER_TARGET`` not being present. Arm architecture not given; --------------------------; The ``--target=arm-linux-gnueabihf`` will default to arm architecture v4t which; cannot assemble the barrier instructions used in the synch_and_fetch source; files.

C++ commands follow C++ syntax (almost). ``` {.cpp}; root[] TBrowser *b = new TBrowser(); ```. ### Multi-line Commands. You can use the command line to execute multi-line commands. To begin; a multi-line command you must type a single left curly bracket `{`,; and to end it you must type a single right curly bracket `}`.; For example:. ``` {.cpp}; root[] {; end with '}'> Int_t j = 0;; end with '}'> for (Int_t i = 0; i < 3; i++); end with '}'> {; end with '}'> j= j + i;; end with '}'> cout << ""i = "" << i << "", j = "" << j << endl;; end with '}",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/GettingStarted.md:25215,avail,available,25215,documentation/users-guide/GettingStarted.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/GettingStarted.md,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"s; Using ccache materially improves average build times. Incremental builds; can be slightly faster, but introduce the risk of build corruption due to; e.g. state changes, etc... At this point, the recommendation is not to; use incremental builds and instead use ccache as the latter captures the; majority of the benefit with less risk of false positives. One of the non-obvious benefits of using ccache is that it makes the; builder less sensitive to which projects are being monitored vs built.; If a change triggers a build request, but doesn't change the build output; (e.g. doc changes, python utility changes, etc..), the build will entirely; hit in cache and the build request will complete in just the testing time. With multiple workers, it is tempting to try to configure a shared cache; between the workers. Experience to date indicates this is difficult to; well, and that having local per-worker caches gets most of the benefit; anyways. We don't currently recommend shared caches. CCache does depend on the builder hardware having sufficient IO to access; the cache with reasonable access times - i.e. a fast disk, or enough memory; for a RAM cache, etc.. For builders without, incremental may be your best; option, but is likely to require higher ongoing involvement from the; sponsor. Enable batch builds; As a last resort, you can configure your builder to batch build requests.; This makes the build failure notifications markedly less actionable, and; should only be done once all other reasonable measures have been taken. Leave it on the staging buildmaster; While most of this section has been biased towards builders intended for; the main buildmaster, it is worth highlighting that builders can run; indefinitely on the staging buildmaster.

We do not remove the erroneous nodes because by the time when we recognize the error it is too late to remove the node, there may be additional references to that already in the AST.; This is aligned with the overall `design principle of the Clang AST <InternalsManual.html#immutability>`_: Clang AST nodes (types, declarations, statements, expressions, and so on) are generally designed to be **immutable once created**.; Thus, clients of the ASTImporter library should always check if there is any associated error for the node which they inspect in the destination context.; We recommend skipping the processing of those nodes which have an error associated with them.

Availability,"sabling Instrumentation with ``__attribute__((no_sanitize(""undefined"")))``; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------. You disable UBSan checks for particular functions with; ``__attribute__((no_sanitize(""undefined"")))``. You can use all values of; ``-fsanitize=`` flag in this attribute, e.g. if your function deliberately; contains possible signed integer overflow, you can use; ``__attribute__((no_sanitize(""signed-integer-overflow"")))``. This attribute may not be; supported by other compilers, so consider using it together with; ``#if defined(__clang__)``. Suppressing Errors in Recompiled Code (Ignorelist); --------------------------------------------------. UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer supports ``src`` and ``fun`` entity types in; :doc:`SanitizerSpecialCaseList`, that can be used to suppress error reports; in the specified source files or functions. Runtime suppressions; --------------------. Sometimes you can suppress UBSan error reports for specific files, functions,; or libraries without recompiling the code. You need to pass a path to; suppression file in a ``UBSAN_OPTIONS`` environment variable. .. code-block:: bash. UBSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=MyUBSan.supp. You need to specify a :ref:`check <ubsan-checks>` you are suppressing and the; bug location. For example:. .. code-block:: bash. signed-integer-overflow:file-with-known-overflow.cpp; alignment:function_doing_unaligned_access; vptr:shared_object_with_vptr_failures.so. There are several limitations:. * Sometimes your binary must have enough debug info and/or symbol table, so; that the runtime could figure out source file or function name to match; against the suppression.; * It is only possible to suppress recoverable checks. For the example above,; you can additionally pass; ``-fsanitize-recover=signed-integer-overflow,alignment,vptr``, although; most of UBSan checks are recoverable by default.; * Check groups (like ``undefined``) can't be used in suppressions file, only; fin",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.rst:14374,error,error,14374,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.rst,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"sage::addRequired<>`` and ``AnalysisUsage::addRequiredTransitive<>`` methods; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. If your pass requires a previous pass to be executed (an analysis for example),; it can use one of these methods to arrange for it to be run before your pass.; LLVM has many different types of analyses and passes that can be required,; spanning the range from ``DominatorSet`` to ``BreakCriticalEdges``. Requiring; ``BreakCriticalEdges``, for example, guarantees that there will be no critical; edges in the CFG when your pass has been run. Some analyses chain to other analyses to do their job. For example, an; `AliasAnalysis <AliasAnalysis>` implementation is required to :ref:`chain; <aliasanalysis-chaining>` to other alias analysis passes. In cases where; analyses chain, the ``addRequiredTransitive`` method should be used instead of; the ``addRequired`` method. This informs the ``PassManager`` that the; transitively required pass should be alive as long as the requiring pass is. The ``AnalysisUsage::addPreserved<>`` method; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. One of the jobs of the ``PassManager`` is to optimize how and when analyses are; run. In particular, it attempts to avoid recomputing data unless it needs to.; For this reason, passes are allowed to declare that they preserve (i.e., they; don't invalidate) an existing analysis if it's available. For example, a; simple constant folding pass would not modify the CFG, so it can't possibly; affect the results of dominator analysis. By default, all passes are assumed; to invalidate all others. The ``AnalysisUsage`` class provides several methods which are useful in; certain circumstances that are related to ``addPreserved``. In particular, the; ``setPreservesAll`` method can be called to indicate that the pass does not; modify the LLVM program at all (which is true for analyses), and the; ``setPreservesCFG`` method can be used by transforma",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.rst:31088,alive,alive,31088,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.rst,1,['alive'],['alive']
Availability,"sal is *Not* About; =================================. Changing the development policy. This proposal relates only to moving the hosting of our source-code repository; from SVN hosted on our own servers to Git hosted on GitHub. We are not proposing; using GitHub's issue tracker, pull-requests, or code-review. Contributors will continue to earn commit access on demand under the Developer; Policy, except that that a GitHub account will be required instead of SVN; username/password-hash. Why Git, and Why GitHub?; ========================. Why Move At All?; ----------------. This discussion began because we currently host our own Subversion server; and Git mirror on a voluntary basis. The LLVM Foundation sponsors the server and; provides limited support, but there is only so much it can do. Volunteers are not sysadmins themselves, but compiler engineers that happen; to know a thing or two about hosting servers. We also don't have 24/7 support,; and we sometimes wake up to see that continuous integration is broken because; the SVN server is either down or unresponsive. We should take advantage of one of the services out there (GitHub, GitLab,; and BitBucket, among others) that offer better service (24/7 stability, disk; space, Git server, code browsing, forking facilities, etc) for free. Why Git?; --------. Many new coders nowadays start with Git, and a lot of people have never used; SVN, CVS, or anything else. Websites like GitHub have changed the landscape; of open source contributions, reducing the cost of first contribution and; fostering collaboration. Git is also the version control many LLVM developers use. Despite the; sources being stored in a SVN server, these developers are already using Git; through the Git-SVN integration.

A fixed point number represents a real data type for a number that has a fixed; number of digits after a radix point (equivalent to the decimal point '.').; The number of digits after the radix point is referred as the `scale`. These; are useful for representing fractional values to a specific precision. The; following intrinsics perform fixed point arithmetic operations on 2 operands; of the same scale, specified as the third argument.

If :program:`FileCheck` verifies that the file matches the expected contents,; it exits with 0. Otherwise, if not, or if an error occurs, it will exit with a; non-zero value. TUTORIAL; --------. FileCheck is typically used from LLVM regression tests, being invoked on the RUN; line of the test. A simple example of using FileCheck from a RUN line looks; like this:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llvm-as < %s | llc -march=x86-64 | FileCheck %s. This syntax says to pipe the current file (""``%s``"") into ``llvm-as``, pipe; that into ``llc``, then pipe the output of ``llc`` into ``FileCheck``. This; means that FileCheck will be verifying its standard input (the llc output); against the filename argument specified (the original ``.ll`` file specified by; ""``%s``""). To see how this works, let's look at the rest of the ``.ll`` file; (after the RUN line):. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @sub1(i32* %p, i32 %v) {; entry:; ; CHECK: sub1:; ; CHECK: subl; %0 = tail call i32 @llvm.atomic.load.sub.i32.p0i32(i32* %p, i32 %v); ret void; }. define void @inc4(i64* %p) {; entry:; ; CHECK: inc4:; ; CHECK: incq; %0 = tail call i64 @llvm.atom",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst:7734,error,error,7734,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.rst,1,['error'],['error']

Note that when using the common `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDIm` class the enumeration type defining the algorithm must be defined in the namespace `ROOT::Math::IntegrationOneDim` (to distinguish from; the multi-dimensional case) and the rule enumeration (or its corresponding integer) can be passed in the constructor of the `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDIm`. ### Multi-dimensional Integration. The multi-dimensional integration algorithm should be applied to functions with dimension larger than one.; Adaptive multi-dimensional integration works for low function dimension, while MC integration can be applied to higher dimensions. #### Using `ROOT::Math::IntegratorMultiDim`. Here is a code example on how to use the `ROOT::Math::IntegratorOneDim` class; (note that the class is defined in the header file `Math/Integrator.h`). In this example we create; different instance of the class using some of the available algorithms in ROOT. ```{.cpp}; #include ""Math/IntegratorMultiDim.h""; #include ""Math/Functor.h"". double f2(const double * x) {; return x[0] + x[1];; }. int testIntegrationMultiDim() {. const double RESULT = 1.0;; const double ERRORLIMIT = 1E-3;; int status = 0;.

This; option should not be used if your distribution includes static archives, as the; objects inside the archive will be LLVM bitcode, which is not portable. The :doc:`AdvancedBuilds` documentation describes the built-in tooling for; generating LLVM profiling information to drive Profile-Guided-Optimization. The; in-tree profiling tests are very limited, and generating the profile takes a; significant amount of time, but it can result in a significant improvement in; the performance of the generated binaries. In addition to PGO profiling we also have limited support in-tree for generating; linker order files. These files provide the linker with a suggested ordering for; functions in the final binary layout. This can measurably speed up clang by; physically grouping functions that are called temporally close to each other.; The current tooling is only available on Darwin systems with ``dtrace(1)``. It; is worth noting that dtrace is non-deterministic, and so the order file; generation using dtrace is also non-deterministic. Options for Reducing Size; =========================. .. warning::; Any steps taken to reduce the binary size will come at a cost of runtime; performance in the generated binaries. The simplest and least significant way to reduce binary size is to set the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* variable to ``MinSizeRel``, which will set the compiler; optimization level to ``-Os`` which optimizes for binary size. This will have; both the least benefit to size and the least impact on performance. The most impactful way to reduce binary size is to dynamically link LLVM into; all the tools. This reduces code size by decreasing duplication of common code; between the LLVM-based tools. This can be done by setting the following two; CMake options to ``On``: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* and *LLVM_LINK_LLVM_DYLIB*. .. warning::; Distributions should never",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst:9670,avail,available,9670,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

The ``InFlightAlloc`` object has two virtual methods:. .. code-block:: c++. using OnFinalizedFunction = unique_function<void(Expected<FinalizedAlloc>)>;; using OnAbandonedFunction = unique_function<void(Error)>;. /// Called prior to finalization if the allocation should be abandoned.; virtual void abandon(OnAbandonedFunction OnAbandoned) = 0;. /// Called to transfer working memory to the target and apply finalization.; virtual void finalize(OnFinalizedFunction OnFinalized) = 0;. The linking process will call the ``finalize`` method on the ``InFlightAlloc``; object if linking succeeds up to the finalization step, otherwise it will call; ``abandon`` to indicate that some error occurred during linking. A call to the; ``InFlightAlloc::finalize`` method should cause content for the allocation to be; transferred from working to executor memory, and permissions to be run. A call; to ``abandon`` should result in both kinds of memory being deallocated. On successful finalization, the ``InFlightAlloc::finalize`` method should; construct a ``FinalizedAlloc`` object (an opaque uint64_t id that the; ``JITLinkMemoryManager`` can use to identify executor memory for deallocation); and pass it to the ``OnFinalized`` callback. Finalized allocations (represented by ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects) can be; deallocated by calling the ``JITLinkMemoryManager::dealloc`` method. This method; takes a vector of ``FinalizedAlloc`` objects, since it is common to deallocate; multiple objects at the same time and this allows us to batch these requests for; transmission to the executing process.

Unfortunately this can't work because we have to define different macros during; host compilation and during device compilation for each GPU architecture.). clang's approach allows it to be highly robust to C++ edge cases, as it doesn't; need to decide at an early stage which declarations to keep and which to throw; away. But it has some consequences you should be aware of. Overloading Based on ``__host__`` and ``__device__`` Attributes; ---------------------------------------------------------------. Let ""H"", ""D"", and ""HD"" stand for ""``__host__`` functions"", ""``__device__``; functions"", and ""``__host__ __device__`` functions"", respectively. Functions; with no attributes behave the same as H. nvcc does not allow you to create H and D functions with the same signature:. .. code-block:: c++. // nvcc: error - function ""foo"" has already been defined; __host__ void foo() {}; __device__ void foo() {}. However, nvcc allows you to ""overload"" H and D functions with different; signatures:. .. code-block:: c++. // nvcc: no error; __host__ void foo(int) {}; __device__ void foo() {}. In clang, the ``__host__`` and ``__device__`` attributes are part of a; function's signature, and so it's legal to have H and D functions with; (otherwise) the same signature:. .. code-block:: c++. // clang: no error; __host__ void foo() {}; __device__ void foo() {}. HD functions cannot be overloaded by H or D functions with the same signature:. .. code-block:: c++. // nvcc: error - function ""foo"" has already been defined; // clang: error - redefinition of 'foo'; __host__ __device__ void foo() {}; __device__ void foo() {}. // nvcc: no error; // clang: no error; __host__ __device__ void bar(int) {}; __device__ void bar() {}.

We could still handle this case by finding a maximal range in the code where; `pi` could be in the Compatible state, and only refactoring that part. ```c++; void ConflictingOwnership() {; int *pi;; pi = GetPtr();; Borrow(pi);. std::unique_ptr<int> pi_unique = std::make_unique<int>();; Borrow(pi_unique.get());; }; ```. ## Example: finding redundant branch conditions. In the code below `b1` should not be checked in both the outer and inner ""if""; statements. It is likely there is a bug in this code. ```c++; int F(bool b1, bool b2) {; if (b1) {; f();; if (b1 && b2) { // Check `b1` again -- unnecessary!; g();; }; }; }; ```. A checker that finds this pattern syntactically is already implemented in; ClangTidy using AST matchers (`bugprone-redundant-branch-condition`). To implement it using the data flow analysis framework, we can produce a warning; if any part of the branch condition is implied by the flow condition. ```c++; int F(bool b1, bool b2) {; // Flow condition: true.; if (b1) {; // Flow condition: b1.; f();; if (b1 && b2) { // `b1` is implied by the flow condition.; g();; }; }; }; ```. One way to check this implication is to use a SAT solver. Without a SAT solver,; we could keep the flow condition in the CNF form and then it would be easy to; check the implication. ## Example: finding unchecked `std::optional` unwraps. Calling `optional::value()` is only valid if `optional::has_value()` is true. We; want to show that when `x.value()` is executed, the flow condition implies; `x.has_value()`. In the example below `x.value()` is accessed safely because it is guarded by the; `x.has_value()` check. ```c++; void Example(std::optional<int> &x) {; if (x.has_value()) {; use(x.v",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md:26227,redundant,redundant-branch-condition,26227,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/DataFlowAnalysisIntro.md,1,['redundant'],['redundant-branch-condition']

When assertions are enabled, this will print the message if it's ever reached; and then exit the program. When assertions are disabled (i.e. in release; builds), ``llvm_unreachable`` becomes a hint to compilers to skip generating; code for this branch. If the compiler does not support this, it will fall back; to the ""abort"" implementation. Use ``llvm_unreachable`` to mark a specific point in code that should never be; reached. This is especially desirable for addressing warnings about unreachable; branches, etc., but can be used whenever reaching a particular code path is; unconditionally a bug (not originating from user input; see below) of some kind.; Use of ``assert`` should always include a testable predicate (as opposed to; ``assert(false)``). If the error condition can be triggered by user input then the; recoverable error mechanism described in :doc:`ProgrammersManual` should be; used instead. In cases where this is not practical, ``report_fatal_error`` may; be used. Another issue is that values used only by assertions will produce an ""unused; value"" warning when assertions are disabled. For example, this code will warn:. .. code-block:: c++. unsigned Size = V.size();; assert(Size > 42 && ""Vector smaller than it should be"");. bool NewToSet = Myset.insert(Value);; assert(NewToSet && ""The value shouldn't be in the set yet"");. These are two interesting different cases. In the first case, the call to; ``V.size()`` is only useful for the assert, and we don't want it executed when; assertions are disabled. Code like this should move the call into the assert; itself. In the second case, the side effects of the call must happen whether; the assert is enabled or not.

Design Guidelines; -----------------; In what follows, the term ""input IR"" refers to code that is fed into the; vectorizer whereas the term ""output IR"" refers to code that is generated by the; vectorizer. The output IR contains code that has been vectorized or ""widened""; according to a loop Vectorization Factor (VF), and/or loop unroll-and-jammed; according to an Unroll Factor (UF).; The design of VPlan follows several high-level guidelines:. 1. Analysis-like: building and manipulating VPlans must not modify the input IR.; In particular, if the best option is not to vectorize at all, the; vectorization process terminates before reaching Step 3, and compilation; should proceed as if VPlans had not been built. 2. Align Cost & Execute: each VPlan must support both estimating the cost and; generating the output IR code, such that the cost estimation evaluates the; to-be-generated code reliably. 3. Support vectorizing additional constructs:. a. Outer-loop vectorization. In particular, VPlan must be able to model the; control-flow of the output IR which may include multiple basic-blocks and; nested loops.; b. SLP vectorization.; c. Combinations of the above, including nested vectorization: vectorizing; both an inner loop and an outer-loop at the same time (each with its own; VF and UF), mixed vectorization: vectorizing a loop with SLP patterns; inside [4]_, (re)vectorizing input IR containing vector code.; d. Function vectorization [2]_. 4. Support multiple candidates efficiently. In particular, similar candidates; related to a range of possible VF's and UF's must be represented efficiently.; Potential versioning needs to be supported efficiently. 5.

The **cl::Grouping** modifier can be combined with any formatting types except; for `cl::Positional`_. It is used to implement Unix-style tools (like ``ls``); that have lots of single letter arguments, but only require a single dash.; For example, the '``ls -labF``' command actually enables four different options,; all of which are single letters. Note that **cl::Grouping** options can have values only if they are used; separately or at the end of the groups. For `cl::ValueRequired`_, it is; a runtime error if such an option is used elsewhere in the group. The CommandLine library does not restrict how you use the **cl::Prefix** or; **cl::Grouping** modifiers, but it is possible to specify ambiguous argument; settings.

To do this, the CommandLine library uses a greedy algorithm to parse the input; option into (potentially multiple) prefix and grouping options.

ORC's JIT program model aims to emulate the linking and symbol resolution; rules used by the static and dynamic linkers. This allows ORC to JIT; arbitrary LLVM IR, including IR produced by an ordinary static compiler (e.g.; clang) that uses constructs like symbol linkage and visibility, and weak [3]_; and common symbol definitions.

Additionally, the following special; **pattern strings** are rewritten:. * ""%p"" expands out to the process ID. * ""%h"" expands out to the hostname of the machine running the program. * ""%t"" expands out to the value of the ``TMPDIR`` environment variable. On; Darwin, this is typically set to a temporary scratch directory. * ""%Nm"" expands out to the instrumented binary's signature. When this pattern; is specified, the runtime creates a pool of N raw profiles which are used for; on-line profile merging. The runtime takes care of selecting a raw profile; from the pool, locking it, and updating it before the program exits. If N is; not specified (i.e the pattern is ""%m""), it's assumed that ``N = 1``. The; merge pool specifier can only occur once per filename pattern. * ""%c"" expands out to nothing, but enables a mode in which profile counter; updates are continuously synced to a file. This means that if the; instrumented program crashes, or is killed by a signal, perfect coverage; information can still be recovered. Continuous mode does not support value; profiling for PGO, and is only supported on Darwin at the moment.

Cling follows the C++ standard much more strictly than CINT. In; particular some code that used to run with CINT will either issue new; warnings or new compilation errors. For example when CINT was parsing; Namespace::%Symbol it would not only apply the C++ search rules but also; search in the outer scopes and for this example could actually return; ::%Symbol instead of (as Cling now does) issuing a compilation error. #### Template class names; Cling no longer supports refering to a class template instantiation of a; class template that has all default template parameter without the \<\>.; With:. ``` {.cpp}; template <typename T = int> class templt {};; ```. With Cling (and any standard compliant compiler), using `*templt<>*` is; allowed (but `*templt*` is not). #### Namespace prefix of template parameters; Given `namespace N { class A; template <typename T> class B;}`, the name; `N::B<N::A>` is no longer ""shortened"" to `N::B<A>`. This affects the forward; and backward compatibility of files. #### Implicit dynamic up-casts; CINT would perform automatic upcasts to derived classes under certain contexts:. ``` {.cpp}; TH1* h1 = hpx; TH1F* h1f = h1;; ```. Cling does not allow this anymore.

To retrieve them we; need to hand the ASTContext into our RecursiveASTVisitor implementation. The ASTContext is available from the CompilerInstance during the call to; CreateASTConsumer. We can thus extract it there and hand it into our; freshly created FindNamedClassConsumer:. ::. virtual std::unique_ptr<clang::ASTConsumer> CreateASTConsumer(; clang::CompilerInstance &Compiler, llvm::StringRef InFile) {; return std::make_unique<FindNamedClassConsumer>(&Compiler.getASTContext());; }.

In this case, the ``basic-aa`` pass will disambiguate the stores to ``C[0]`` and; ``C[1]`` because they are accesses to two distinct locations one byte apart, and; the accesses are each one byte. In this case, the Loop Invariant Code Motion; (LICM) pass can use store motion to remove the stores from the loop. In; contrast, the following code:. .. code-block:: c++. int i;; char C[2];; char A[10];; /* ... */; for (i = 0; i != 10; ++i) {; ((short*)C)[0] = A[i]; /* Two byte store! */; C[1] = A[9-i]; /* One byte store */; }. In this case, the two stores to C do alias each other, because the access to the; ``&C[0]`` element is a two byte access. If size information wasn't available in; the query, even the first case would have to conservatively assume that the; accesses alias. .. _alias:. The ``alias`` method; --------------------.

See DWARF Version 5 section 2.5 and; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-expressions`. DWARF location descriptions describe how to access storage which includes memory; and registers. When accessing storage on AMDGPU, bytes are ordered with least; significant bytes first, and bits are ordered within bytes with least; significant bits first. For AMDGPU CFI expressions, ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` is used to describe; unwinding vector registers that are spilled under the execution mask to memory:; the zero-single location description is the vector register, and the one-single; location description is the spilled memory location description. The; ``DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address`` is used to specify the address space of the; memory location description. In AMDGPU expressions, ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` is used by the; ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` attribute expression where divergent control flow is; controlled by the execution mask. An undefined location description together; with ``DW_OP_LLVM_extend`` is used to indicate the lane was not active on entry; to the subprogram.

There are two tables that are used by the exception handling runtime to; determine which actions should be taken when an exception is thrown. Exception Handling Frame; ------------------------. An exception handling frame ``eh_frame`` is very similar to the unwind frame; used by DWARF debug info. The frame contains all the information necessary to; tear down the current frame and restore the state of the prior frame. There is; an exception handling frame for each function in a compile unit, plus a common; exception handling frame that defines information common to all functions in the; unit. The format of this call frame information (CFI) is often platform-dependent,; however. ARM, for example, defines their own format. Apple has their own compact; unwind info format. On Windows, another format is used for all architectures; since 32-bit x86. LLVM will emit whatever information is required by the; target. Exception Tables; ----------------.

Availability,"soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` is too low level. It should be; ``OpenOrCreateFileForWriting``. In the case of the soft ""doesn't exist"" error,; this function would just create it and then open it for writing. This design principle needs to be maintained in ``lib/Support`` because it; avoids the propagation of soft error handling throughout the rest of LLVM.; Hard errors will generally just cause a termination for an LLVM tool so don't; be bashful about throwing them. Rules of thumb:. #. Don't throw soft errors, only hard errors. #. If you're tempted to throw a soft error, re-think the interface. #. Handle internally the most common normal/good/soft error conditions; so the rest of LLVM doesn't have to. No throw Specifications; -----------------------. None of the ``lib/Support`` interface functions may be declared with C++; ``throw()`` specifications on them. This requirement makes sure that the; compiler does not insert additional exception handling code into the interface; functions. This is a performance consideration: ``lib/Support`` functions are; at the bottom of many call chains and as such can be frequently called. We; need them to be as efficient as possible.

Availability,"some interesting aspects to this. The most important one is; that this routine eats all of the tokens that correspond to the; production and returns the lexer buffer with the next token (which is; not part of the grammar production) ready to go. This is a fairly; standard way to go for recursive descent parsers. For a better example,; the parenthesis operator is defined like this:. .. code-block:: c++. /// parenexpr ::= '(' expression ')'; static std::unique_ptr<ExprAST> ParseParenExpr() {; getNextToken(); // eat (.; auto V = ParseExpression();; if (!V); return nullptr;. if (CurTok != ')'); return LogError(""expected ')'"");; getNextToken(); // eat ).; return V;; }. This function illustrates a number of interesting things about the; parser:. 1) It shows how we use the LogError routines. When called, this function; expects that the current token is a '(' token, but after parsing the; subexpression, it is possible that there is no ')' waiting. For example,; if the user types in ""(4 x"" instead of ""(4)"", the parser should emit an; error. Because errors can occur, the parser needs a way to indicate that; they happened: in our parser, we return null on an error. 2) Another interesting aspect of this function is that it uses recursion; by calling ``ParseExpression`` (we will soon see that; ``ParseExpression`` can call ``ParseParenExpr``). This is powerful; because it allows us to handle recursive grammars, and keeps each; production very simple. Note that parentheses do not cause construction; of AST nodes themselves. While we could do it this way, the most; important role of parentheses are to guide the parser and provide; grouping. Once the parser constructs the AST, parentheses are not; needed. The next simple production is for handling variable references and; function calls:. .. code-block:: c++. /// identifierexpr; /// ::= identifier; /// ::= identifier '(' expression* ')'; static std::unique_ptr<ExprAST> ParseIdentifierExpr() {; std::string IdName = IdentifierStr;. ge",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst:8827,error,error,8827,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl02.rst,1,['error'],['error']

We maintain a set of ""ideas"" for talented scientists and developers to pick up. An ""idea"" can be a sketch of a development project, a functionality, a missing feature we would like to see in our tool.; A list that we propose is the following:. Ideas. Extending and improving the multiline input mode - The multiline mode has to figure out automatically whether the user's input is still incomplete. For example ""if (a < 0) {"" is not fully completed input. Cling should'n try to process the line but to be smart enough to understand that it should wait for continuation. Currently cling switches multiline mode only when there is trailing ""{"". It has to be extended to detect trailing +, unbalanced ',"" and so on. Implementing error recovery verifier - One of the most important parts in cling is the error recovery. The error recovery takes care of reverting clang's internal structures on error in the user input. For instance, user types int i; error_here;. int i should be reverted and the entire input should be invalidated. This is very complex because many implicit template instantiations could be triggered and so on. The idea of the future verifier is to serialize the AST with all the lookup structures (probably in pch or pcm), trigger an error causing a lot of things to happen in clang internally and serialize the new AST. The comparison with the old one must return perfect match. Enabling clang's static analyzer - coming soon. Enabling ObjectiveC/ObjectiveC++ support - coming soon.

Availability,"source locations, or any other information; provided on the AST level. AST matchers are predicates on nodes in the AST. Matchers are created by; calling creator functions that allow building up a tree of matchers, where; inner matchers are used to make the match more specific. For example, to create a matcher that matches all class or union declarations; in the AST of a translation unit, you can call `recordDecl(); <LibASTMatchersReference.html#recordDecl0Anchor>`_. To narrow the match down,; for example to find all class or union declarations with the name ""``Foo``"",; insert a `hasName <LibASTMatchersReference.html#hasName0Anchor>`_ matcher: the; call ``recordDecl(hasName(""Foo""))`` returns a matcher that matches classes or; unions that are named ""``Foo``"", in any namespace. By default, matchers that; accept multiple inner matchers use an implicit `allOf(); <LibASTMatchersReference.html#allOf0Anchor>`_. This allows further narrowing; down the match, for example to match all classes that are derived from; ""``Bar``"": ``recordDecl(hasName(""Foo""), isDerivedFrom(""Bar""))``. How to create a matcher; -----------------------. With more than a thousand classes in the Clang AST, one can quickly get lost; when trying to figure out how to create a matcher for a specific pattern. This; section will teach you how to use a rigorous step-by-step pattern to build the; matcher you are interested in. Note that there will always be matchers missing; for some part of the AST. See the section about :ref:`how to write your own; AST matchers <astmatchers-writing>` later in this document. .. FIXME: why is it linking back to the same section?!. The precondition to using the matchers is to understand how the AST for what you; want to match looks like.

Flat access to scratch requires hardware aperture setup and setup in the; kernel prologue (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch`). Flat; access to LDS requires hardware aperture setup and M0 (GFX7-GFX8) register; setup (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-m0`).

Recoverable errors represent an error in the program's environment, for example; a resource failure (a missing file, a dropped network connection, etc.), or; malformed input.

Handling the error may be; as simple as reporting the issue to the user, or it may involve attempts at; recovery. .. note::. While it would be ideal to use this error handling scheme throughout; LLVM, there are places where this hasn't been practical to apply. In; situations where you absolutely must emit a non-programmatic error and; the ``Error`` model isn't workable you can call ``report_fatal_error``,; which will call installed error handlers, print a message, and abort the; program. The use of `report_fatal_error` in this case is discouraged. Recoverable errors are modeled using LLVM's ``Error`` scheme. This scheme; represents errors using function return values, similar to classic C integer; error codes, or C++'s ``std::error_code``. However, the ``Error`` class is; actually a lightweight wrapper for user-defined error types, allowing arbitrary; information to be attached to describe the error. This is similar to the way C++; exceptions allow throwing of user-defined types. Success values are created by calling ``Error::success()``, E.g.:. .. code-block:: c++.

Availability,"sses tends to have a lot of non-trivial surface area (e.g. vtables) that; would require great care to mock. Tips for JITLink backend developers; -----------------------------------. #. Make liberal use of assert and ``llvm::Error``. Do *not* assume that the input; object is well formed: Return any errors produced by libObject (or your own; object parsing code) and validate as you construct. Think carefully about the; distinction between contract (which should be validated with asserts and; llvm_unreachable) and environmental errors (which should generate; ``llvm::Error`` instances). #. Don't assume you're linking in-process. Use libSupport's sized,; endian-specific types when reading/writing content in the ``LinkGraph``. As a ""minimum viable"" JITLink wrapper, the ``llvm-jitlink`` tool is an; invaluable resource for developers bringing in a new JITLink backend. A standard; workflow is to start by throwing an unsupported object at the tool and seeing; what error is returned, then fixing that (you can often make a reasonable guess; at what should be done based on existing code for other formats or; architectures). In debug builds of LLVM, the ``-debug-only=jitlink`` option dumps logs from the; JITLink library during the link process. These can be useful for spotting some bugs at; a glance. The ``-debug-only=llvm_jitlink`` option dumps logs from the ``llvm-jitlink``; tool, which can be useful for debugging both testcases (it is often less verbose than; ``-debug-only=jitlink``) and the tool itself. The ``-oop-executor`` and ``-oop-executor-connect`` options are helpful for testing; handling of cross-process and cross-architecture use cases. Roadmap; =======. JITLink is under active development.

If the; size of the sub-vector is larger than the vector size a static assert (a; compilation error) is produced. ``` {.cpp}; SVector>double,N> v;; SVector>double,M> w;; // M <= N otherwise a compilation error is obtained later; // place a vector of size M starting from; // element ioff, v[ioff+i]=w[i]; v.Place_at(w,ioff);; // return a sub-vector of size M starting from; // v[ioff]: w[i]=v[ioff+i]; w = v.Sub < SVector>double,M> > (ioff);; ```. For the vector functions see later in the Matrix and Vector Operators; and Functions paragraph. ### Example: Matrix Class (SMatrix). The template class **`ROOT::Math::SMatrix`** represents a matrix of; arbitrary type with `nrows` `x` `ncol` dimension. The class has 4; template parameters, which define at compile time, its properties:. - type of the contained elements, T, for example float or double;. - number of rows;. - number of columns;. - representation type. This is a class describing the underlined; storage model of the Matrix. Presently exists only two types of this; class:. - **`ROOT::Math::MatRepStd`** for a general `nrows x ncols` matrix.; This class is itself a template on the contained type `T`, the; number of rows and the number of columns.

If one or more of the predecessors of the block can be; proven to always cause a jump to one of the successors, we forward the edge; from the predecessor to the successor by duplicating the contents of this; block. An example of when this can occur is code like this:. .. code-block:: c++. if () { ...; X = 4;; }; if (X < 3) {. In this case, the unconditional branch at the end of the first if can be; revectored to the false side of the second if. .. _passes-lcssa:. ``lcssa``: Loop-Closed SSA Form Pass; ------------------------------------. This pass transforms loops by placing phi nodes at the end of the loops for all; values that are live across the loop boundary. For example, it turns the left; into the right code:. .. code-block:: c++. for (...) for (...); if (c) if (c); X1 = ... X1 = ...; else else; X2 = ... X2 = ...; X3 = phi(X1, X2) X3 = phi(X1, X2); ... = X3 + 4 X4 = phi(X3); ... = X4 + 4. This is still valid LLVM; the extra phi nodes are purely redundant, and will be; trivially eliminated by ``InstCombine``. The major benefit of this; transformation is that it makes many other loop optimizations, such as; ``LoopUnswitch``\ ing, simpler. You can read more in the; :ref:`loop terminology section for the LCSSA form <loop-terminology-lcssa>`. .. _passes-licm:. ``licm``: Loop Invariant Code Motion; ------------------------------------. This pass performs loop invariant code motion, attempting to remove as much; code from the body of a loop as possible. It does this by either hoisting code; into the preheader block, or by sinking code to the exit blocks if it is safe.; This pass also promotes must-aliased memory locations in the loop to live in; registers, thus hoisting and sinking ""invariant"" loads and stores.

One other feature of YAML is the ability to define multiple documents in a; single file. That is why reading YAML produces a vector of your document type. Error Handling; ==============. When parsing a YAML document, if the input does not match your schema (as; expressed in your XxxTraits<> specializations). YAML I/O; will print out an error message and your Input object's error() method will; return true. For instance the following document:. .. code-block:: yaml. - name: Tom; shoe-size: 12; - name: Dan; hat-size: 7. Has a key (shoe-size) that is not defined in the schema.

Similar errors are produced for other input not conforming to the schema. Scalars; =======. YAML scalars are just strings (i.e. not a sequence or mapping). The YAML I/O; library provides support for translating between YAML scalars and specific; C++ types. Built-in types; --------------; The following types have built-in support in YAML I/O:. * bool; * float; * double; * StringRef; * std::string; * int64_t; * int32_t; * int16_t; * int8_t; * uint64_t; * uint32_t; * uint16_t; * uint8_t. That is, you can use those types in fields of MappingTraits or as element type; in sequence. When reading, YAML I/O will validate that the string found; is convertible to that type and error out if not. Unique types; ------------; Given that YAML I/O is trait based, the selection of how to convert your data; to YAML is based on the type of your data. But in C++ type matching, typedefs; do not generate unique type names. That means if you have two typedefs of; unsigned int, to YAML I/O both types look exactly like unsigned int.

Availability,"st`` helper program can be used to test these features. Testing; -------; All functional changes to Clang should come with test coverage demonstrating; the change in behavior. .. _verifying-diagnostics:. Verifying Diagnostics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Clang ``-cc1`` supports the ``-verify`` command line option as a way to; validate diagnostic behavior. This option will use special comments within the; test file to verify that expected diagnostics appear in the correct source; locations. If all of the expected diagnostics match the actual output of Clang,; then the invocation will return normally. If there are discrepancies between; the expected and actual output, Clang will emit detailed information about; which expected diagnostics were not seen or which unexpected diagnostics were; seen, etc. A complete example is:. .. code-block: c++. // RUN: %clang_cc1 -verify %s; int A = B; // expected-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'B'}}. If the test is run and the expected error is emitted on the expected line, the; diagnostic verifier will pass. However, if the expected error does not appear; or appears in a different location than expected, or if additional diagnostics; appear, the diagnostic verifier will fail and emit information as to why. The ``-verify`` command optionally accepts a comma-delimited list of one or; more verification prefixes that can be used to craft those special comments.; Each prefix must start with a letter and contain only alphanumeric characters,; hyphens, and underscores. ``-verify`` by itself is equivalent to; ``-verify=expected``, meaning that special comments will start with; ``expected``. Using different prefixes makes it easier to have separate; ``RUN:`` lines in the same test file which result in differing diagnostic; behavior. For example:. .. code-block:: c++. // RUN: %clang_cc1 -verify=foo,bar %s. int A = B; // foo-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'B'}}; int C = D; // bar-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'D'}}; int E = F; // ex",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:155305,error,error,155305,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['error'],['error']

There is a default implementation in; **`TObject`**, but it is typically overridden for classes that can; report peculiarities for different cursor positions (for example the bin; contents in a TH1). ### IsFolder. By default an object inheriting from **`TObject`** is not brows-able,; because **`TObject::IsFolder()`** returns `kFALSE`.

In general, this method returns `kTRUE` if the object contains; browse-able objects (like containers or lists of other objects). ### Bit Masks and Unique ID. A **`TObject`** descendent inherits two data members: `fBits` and; `fUniqueID`. `fBits `is 32-bit data member used with a bit mask to get; object information.

Availability,"stdin. Platform-Specific Tests; -----------------------. Whenever adding tests that require the knowledge of a specific platform,; either related to code generated, specific output or back-end features,; you must make sure to isolate the features, so that buildbots that; run on different architectures (and don't even compile all back-ends),; don't fail. The first problem is to check for target-specific output, for example sizes; of structures, paths and architecture names, for example:. * Tests containing Windows paths will fail on Linux and vice-versa.; * Tests that check for ``x86_64`` somewhere in the text will fail anywhere else.; * Tests where the debug information calculates the size of types and structures. Also, if the test rely on any behaviour that is coded in any back-end, it must; go in its own directory. So, for instance, code generator tests for ARM go; into ``test/CodeGen/ARM`` and so on. Those directories contain a special; ``lit`` configuration file that ensure all tests in that directory will; only run if a specific back-end is compiled and available. For instance, on ``test/CodeGen/ARM``, the ``lit.local.cfg`` is:. .. code-block:: python. config.suffixes = ['.ll', '.c', '.cpp', '.test']; if not 'ARM' in config.root.targets:; config.unsupported = True. Other platform-specific tests are those that depend on a specific feature; of a specific sub-architecture, for example only to Intel chips that support ``AVX2``. For instance, ``test/CodeGen/X86/psubus.ll`` tests three sub-architecture; variants:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: llc -mcpu=core2 < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=SSE2; ; RUN: llc -mcpu=corei7-avx < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=AVX1; ; RUN: llc -mcpu=core-avx2 < %s | FileCheck %s -check-prefix=AVX2. And the checks are different:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; SSE2: @test1; ; SSE2: psubusw LCPI0_0(%rip), %xmm0; ; AVX1: @test1; ; AVX1: vpsubusw LCPI0_0(%rip), %xmm0, %xmm0; ; AVX2: @test1; ; AVX2: vpsubusw LCPI0_0(%rip), %xmm0, %xmm0.

Availability,"stem call is notorious for having variations in the; data it provides. ``lib/Support`` must not declare ``stat`` nor allow it to be; declared. Instead it should provide its own interface to discovering; information about files and directories. Those interfaces may be implemented in; terms of ``stat`` but that is strictly an implementation detail. The interface; provided by the Support Library must be implemented on all platforms (even; those without ``stat``). No Exposed Data; ---------------. Any data defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``) must; not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header file; for that function is not exposed. As with functions, this prevents inadvertent; use of data that might not exist on all platforms. Minimize Soft Errors; --------------------. Operating system interfaces will generally provide error results for every; little thing that could go wrong. In almost all cases, you can divide these; error results into two groups: normal/good/soft and abnormal/bad/hard. That is,; some of the errors are simply information like ""file not found"", ""insufficient; privileges"", etc. while other errors are much harder like ""out of space"", ""bad; disk sector"", or ""system call interrupted"". We'll call the first group ""*soft*""; errors and the second group ""*hard*"" errors. ``lib/Support`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors. This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function.

Instead; it requires that the function contains ""``subl $nnnnnn, %esp``"" in its; prolog.

Late Machine Code Optimizations; -------------------------------. .. note::. To Be Written. .. _Code Emission:. Code Emission; -------------. The code emission step of code generation is responsible for lowering from the; code generator abstractions (like `MachineFunction`_, `MachineInstr`_, etc) down; to the abstractions used by the MC layer (`MCInst`_, `MCStreamer`_, etc). This; is done with a combination of several different classes: the (misnamed); target-independent AsmPrinter class, target-specific subclasses of AsmPrinter; (such as SparcAsmPrinter), and the TargetLoweringObjectFile class.

Instead, we propose to provide; builtins to extract rows and columns from a matrix. This makes the operations; more explicit. Matrix Type Binary Operators; ----------------------------. Given two matrixes, the ``+`` and ``-`` operators perform element-wise addition; and subtraction, while the ``*`` operator performs matrix multiplication.; ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, and ``/`` can also be used with a matrix and a scalar; value, applying the operation to each element of the matrix.

However, since checkers have no guarantee about the order in which the; program will be explored, or even that all possible paths will be explored, this; state information cannot be kept within individual checkers. Therefore, if; checkers need to store custom information, they need to add new categories of; data to the ProgramState. The preferred way to do so is to use one of; several macros designed for this purpose. They are:. REGISTER_TRAIT_WITH_PROGRAMSTATE:; Used when the state information is a single value.

The methods; available for state types declared with this macro are add,; set, get, remove, and contains. All of these macros take as parameters the name to be used for the custom; category of state information and the data type(s) to be used for storage.

Availability,"t --trees Events --all-branches --threads 8; ```. ## Core Libraries. ### Interpreter. #### Support for profiling/debugging interpreted/JITted code. This version of ROOT adds an LLVM JIT event listener to create perf map files; during runtime. This allows profiling of interpreted/JITted code generated by; cling. Instead of function addresses, the perf data will contain full function; names. In addition, stack frame pointers are enabled in JITted code, so full; stack traces can be generated. Debugging is aided by switching off optimisations; and adding frame pointers for better stack traces. However, since both have a; runtime cost, they are disabled by default. Similar to `LD_DEBUG` and `LD_PROFILE`; for `ld.so`, the environment variables `CLING_DEBUG=1` and/or `CLING_PROFILE=1`; can be set to enable debugging and/or profiling. ### Other changes. - Shadowing of declarations in the `std` namespace is now diagnosed. Specifically, given that ROOT injects `using namespace std` directive, _all_ the names in the `std` namespace become available in the global scope. However, in some circumstances users inadvertently introduce a declaration that conflicts with a name in `std` making references to the former declaration result in ambiguous lookup.; A fairly common case is trying to declare a global variable named `data` which conflict with [`std::data`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/data) [C++17]. See [ROOT-5971](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-5971) for a discussion.; As of v6.28, such declarations result in; ```; root [] int data;; ROOT_prompt_0:1:1: warning: 'data' shadows a declaration with the same name in the 'std' namespace; use '::data' to reference this declaration; int data;; ^; ```. - Line editing at the ROOT interactive prompt has been improved.

The complexity of the `RooNLLVarNew::translate()` function in this example can; be attributed to the more complex scenarios/operations specific to the; computation of negative log-likelihood (NLL) values for probability density; functions (PDFs) in RooFit, especially for simultaneous fits (multiple; simultaneous PDFs being considered) and binned likelihoods (adding further; complexity). In this example, the `RooNLLVarNew::translate()` function generates code to; compute the Negative Log likelihood (NLL). We can see that the intermediate; result variable `resName` is added to the context so that it can be accessed; and used in the generated code. This variable is made available globally; (using `addToGlobalScope()`). If a weight sum is needed, then it creates a loop, and `weightSumName` is; accumulated with the weight variable. Otherwise, if there are multiple; simultaneous PDFs, then it adds a term to the result that scales with the; logarithm of the count of simultaneous PDFs. The rest of the function body; (including the loop scope with NLL computation) has omitted from this example; to keep it brief. Helper functions:. - `makeValidVarName()` helps get a valid name from the name of the respective; RooFit class. It then helps save it to the variable that represents the result; of this class (the squashed code/ C++ function that will be created). - `addToGlobalScope()` helps declare and initialize the results variable, so; that it can be available globally (throughout the function body). For local; variables, the `addToCodeBody()` function can be used to keep the variables in; the respective scope (for example, within a loop). - `beginLoop()` helps build the st",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md:16667,avail,available,16667,roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/developers/roofit_ad.md,1,['avail'],['available']

Availability,"t a refactoring action rule. Refactoring Action Rule Requirements; ------------------------------------. A refactoring action rule requirement is a value whose type derives from the; ``RefactoringActionRuleRequirement`` class. The type must define an; ``evaluate`` member function that returns a value of type ``Expected<...>``.; When a requirement value is used as an argument to; ``createRefactoringActionRule``, that value is evaluated during the initiation; of the action rule. The evaluated result is then passed to the rule's; constructor unless the evaluation produced an error. For example, the; ``DeleteSelectedRange`` sample rule that's defined in the previous section; will be evaluated using the following steps:. #. ``SourceRangeSelectionRequirement``'s ``evaluate`` member function will be; called first. It will return an ``Expected<SourceRange>``. #. If the return value is an error the initiation will fail and the error; will be reported to the client. Note that the client may not report the; error to the user. #. Otherwise the source range return value will be used to construct the; ``DeleteSelectedRange`` rule. The rule will then be invoked as the initiation; succeeded (all requirements were evaluated successfully). The same series of steps applies to any refactoring rule. Firstly, the engine; will evaluate all of the requirements. Then it will check if these requirements; are satisfied (they should not produce an error). Then it will construct the; rule and invoke it. The separation of requirements, their evaluation and the invocation of the; refactoring action rule allows the refactoring clients to:. - Disable refactoring action rules whose requirements are not supported. - Gather the set of options and define a command-line / visual interface; that allows users to input these options without ever invoking the; action.

In all other respects, a method with a related result; type is treated the same way as method that returns ``id``. Use ``__has_feature(objc_instancetype)`` to determine whether the; ``instancetype`` contextual keyword is available. Automatic reference counting; ----------------------------. Clang provides support for :doc:`automated reference counting; <AutomaticReferenceCounting>` in Objective-C, which eliminates the need; for manual ``retain``/``release``/``autorelease`` message sends. There are three; feature macros associated with automatic reference counting:; ``__has_feature(objc_arc)`` indicates the availability of automated reference; counting in general, while ``__has_feature(objc_arc_weak)`` indicates that; automated reference counting also includes support for ``__weak`` pointers to; Objective-C objects. ``__has_feature(objc_arc_fields)`` indicates that C structs; are allowed to have fields that are pointers to Objective-C objects managed by; automatic reference counting. .. _objc-weak:.

In hot loops, consider duplicating instructions from small basic blocks; which end in highly predictable terminators into their successor blocks.; If a hot successor block contains instructions which can be vectorized; with the duplicated ones, this can provide a noticeable throughput; improvement.

Recoverable Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Recoverable errors represent an error in the program's environment, for example; a resource failure (a missing file, a dropped network connection, etc.), or; malformed input. These errors should be detected and communicated to a level of; the program where they can be handled appropriately. Handling the error may be; as simple as reporting the issue to the user, or it may involve attempts at; recovery. .. note::. While it would be ideal to use this error handling scheme throughout; LLVM, there are places where this hasn't been practical to apply. In; situations where you absolutely must emit a non-programmatic error and; the ``Error`` model isn't workable you can call ``report_fatal_error``,; which will call installed error handlers, print a message, and abort the; program. The use of `report_fatal_error` in this case is discouraged. Recoverable errors are modeled using LLVM's ``Error`` scheme. This scheme; represents errors using function return values, similar to classic C integer; error codes, or C++'s ``std::error_code``. However, the ``Error`` class is; actually a lightweight wrapper for user-defined error types, allowing arbitrary; information to be attached to describe the error. This is similar to the way C++; exceptions allow throwing of user-defined types. Success values are created by calling ``Error::success()``, E.g.:. .. code-block:: c++. Error foo() {; // Do something.; // Return success.; return Error::success();; }. Success values are very cheap to construct and return - they have minimal; impact on program performance.

Since the transformation is necessarily; non-linear, it would transform a nice linear problem into a nasty; non-linear one, which is the reason why limits should be avoided if; not necessary. In addition, the transformation does require some; computer time, so it slows down the computation a little bit, and more; importantly, it introduces additional numerical inaccuracy into the; problem in addition to what is introduced in the numerical calculation; of the FCN value. The effects of non-linearity and numerical round off; both become more important as the external value gets closer to one of; the limits (expressed as the distance to nearest limit divided by; distance between limits). The user must therefore be aware of the fact; that, for example, if they put limits of (0, 1010) on a parameter, then; the values 0.0 and 1. 0 will be indistinguishable to the accuracy of; most machines.

Availability,"t can fail but need to return a value the ``Expected<T>``; utility can be used. Values of this type can be constructed with either a; ``T``, or an ``Error``. Expected<T> values are also implicitly convertible to; boolean, but with the opposite convention to ``Error``: true for success, false; for error. If success, the ``T`` value can be accessed via the dereference; operator. If failure, the ``Error`` value can be extracted using the; ``takeError()`` method. Idiomatic usage looks like:. .. code-block:: c++. Expected<FormattedFile> openFormattedFile(StringRef Path) {; // If badly formatted, return an error.; if (auto Err = checkFormat(Path)); return std::move(Err);; // Otherwise return a FormattedFile instance.; return FormattedFile(Path);; }.

Some decisions are local to an instruction in the loop, such as whether to widen; it into a vector instruction or replicate it, keeping the generated instructions; in place. Other decisions, however, involve moving instructions, replacing them; with other instructions, and/or introducing new instructions. For example, a; cast may sink past a later instruction and be widened to handle first-order; recurrence; an interleave group of strided gathers or scatters may effectively; move to one place where they are replaced with shuffles and a common wide vector; load or store; new instructions may be introduced to compute masks, shuffle the; elements of vectors, and pack scalar values into vectors or vice-versa. In order for VPlan to support making instruction-level decisions and analyses,; it needs to model the relevant instructions along with their def/use relations.; This too follows a staged approach: first, the new instructions that compute; masks are modeled as VPInstructions, along with their induced def/use subgraph.; This effectively models masks in VPlan, facilitating VPlan-based predication.; Next, the logic embedded within each Recipe for generating its instructions at; VPlan execution time, will instead take part in the planning process by modeling; them as VPInstructions.

The intersections with displayed nodes appear as segments; having the color of the touched node. ## The Drawing Package. ![](pictures/030001E3.png)The modeller provides a powerful drawing; package, supporting several different options of visualization. A; library separated from the main one provides all functionality being; linked with the underlying ROOT visualization system. This library is; dynamically loaded by the plug-in manager only when drawing features are; requested. The geometrical structures that can be visualized are volumes; and volume hierarchies. The main component of the visualization system is volume primitive; painting in a ROOT pad. Starting from this one, several specific options; or subsystems are available, like: X3D viewing using hidden line and; surface removal algorithms, OpenGL viewing\* or ray tracing. The method `TGeoManager::GetGeomPainter()`loads the painting library in; memory. This is generally not needed since it is called automatically by; `TGeoVolume::Draw()` as well as by few other methods setting; visualization attributes. ### Drawing Volumes and Hierarchies of Volumes. The first thing one would like to do after building some geometry is to; visualize the volume tree. This provides the fastest validation check; for most common coding or design mistakes. As soon as the geometry is; successfully closed, one should draw it starting from the top-level; volume:. ``` {.cpp}; //... code for geometry building; root[] gGeoManager->CloseGeometry();; root[] gGeoManager->GetMasterVolume()->Draw();; ```. Doing this ensures that the original top-level volume of the geometry is; drawn, even if another volume is currently the geometry `root`.

The error matrix, which can assign; only symmetric errors, then becomes essentially meaningless. #### Interpretation of Parameter Errors. There are two kinds of problems that can arise: the reliability of; `Minuit`'s error estimates, and their statistical interpretation,; assuming they are accurate. #### Statistical Interpretation. For discussion of basic concepts, such as the meaning of the elements; of the error matrix, or setting of exact confidence levels see the; articles:. - F.James. Determining the statistical Significance of experimental; Results. Technical Report DD/81/02 and CERN Report 81-03, CERN,; 1981. - W.T.Eadie, D.Drijard, F.James, M.Roos, and B.Sadoulet.; *Statistical Methods in Experimental Physics. North-Holland, 1971*. ### Reliability of Minuit Error Estimates. `Minuit` always carries around its own current estimates of the; parameter errors, which it will print out on request, no matter how; accurate they are at any given point in the execution. For example, at; initialization, these estimates are just the starting step sizes as; specified by the user. After a `HESSE` step, the errors are usually; quite accurate, unless there has been a problem. `Minuit`, when it; prints out error values, also gives some indication of how reliable it; thinks they are. For example, those marked `CURRENT GUESS ERROR` are; only working values not to be believed, and `APPROXIMATE ERROR` means; that they have been calculated but there is reason to believe that; they may not be accurate. If no mitigating adjective is given, then at least `Minuit` believes; the errors are accurate, although there is always a small chance that; `Minuit` has been fooled. Some visible signs that `Minuit` may have; been fooled:. - Warning messages produced during the minimization or error; analysis. - Failure to find new minimum. - Value of EDM too big (estimated Distance to Mi",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md:60586,error,errors,60586,documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/FittingHistograms.md,1,['error'],['errors']

SUBPROGRAM X; BEGIN; a;; IF (c1) THEN; b;; IF (c2) THEN; c;; ELSE; d;; ENDIF; e;; ELSE; f;; ENDIF; g;; END. The AMDGPU backend may generate the following pseudo LLVM MIR to manipulate the; execution mask (``EXEC``) to linearize the control flow. The condition is; evaluated to make a mask of the lanes for which the condition evaluates to true.; First the ``THEN`` region is executed by setting the ``EXEC`` mask to the; logical ``AND`` of the current ``EXEC`` mask with the condition mask. Then the; ``ELSE`` region is executed by negating the ``EXEC`` mask and logical ``AND`` of; the saved ``EXEC`` mask at the start of the region. After the ``IF/THEN/ELSE``; region the ``EXEC`` mask is restored to the value it had at the beginning of the; region. This is shown below. Other approaches are possible, but the basic; concept is the same. .. code::; :number-lines:. $lex_start:; a;; %1 = EXEC; %2 = c1; $lex_1_start:; EXEC = %1 & %2; $if_1_then:; b;; %3 = EXEC; %4 = c2; $lex_1_1_start:; EXEC = %3 & %4; $lex_1_1_then:; c;; EXEC = ~EXEC & %3; $lex_1_1_else:; d;; EXEC = %3; $lex_1_1_end:; e;; EXEC = ~EXEC & %1; $lex_1_else:; f;; EXEC = %1; $lex_1_end:; g;; $lex_end:.

This is useful when debugging a problem exposed by; ``opt``, for example, because it runs over 38 passes. Next, ``bugpoint`` tries removing functions from the test program, to reduce its; size. Usually it is able to reduce a test program to a single function, when; debugging intraprocedural optimizations. Once the number of functions has been; reduced, it attempts to delete various edges in the control flow graph, to; reduce the size of the function as much as possible. Finally, ``bugpoint``; deletes any individual LLVM instructions whose absence does not eliminate the; failure.

However, destructors cannot be overloaded. Using a Different Class on Host/Device; --------------------------------------. Occasionally you may want to have a class with different host/device versions. If all of the class's members are the same on the host and device, you can just; provide overloads for the class's member functions. However, if you want your class to have different members on host/device, you; won't be able to provide working H and D overloads in both classes. In this; case, clang is likely to be unhappy with you. .. code-block:: c++. #ifdef __CUDA_ARCH__; struct S {; __device__ void foo() { /* use device_only */ }; int device_only;; };; #else; struct S {; __host__ void foo() { /* use host_only */ }; double host_only;; };. __device__ void test() {; S s;; // clang generates an error here, because during host compilation, we; // have ifdef'ed away the __device__ overload of S::foo(). The __device__; // overload must be present *even during host compilation*.; S.foo();; }; #endif. We posit that you don't really want to have classes with different members on H; and D. For example, if you were to pass one of these as a parameter to a; kernel, it would have a different layout on H and D, so would not work; properly. To make code like this compatible with clang, we recommend you separate it out; into two classes. If you need to write code that works on both host and; device, consider writing an overloaded wrapper function that returns different; types on host and device. .. code-block:: c++. struct HostS { ... };; struct DeviceS { ... };. __host__ HostS MakeStruct() { return HostS(); }; __device__ DeviceS MakeStruct() { return DeviceS(); }. // Now host and device code can call MakeStruct().

This will break code that was assigning to column values in string expressions: this is an intended side effect as we want to prevent non-expert users from performing assignments (`=`) rather than comparisons (`==`). Expert users can resort to compiled callables if they absolutely have to assign to column values (not recommended). See [ROOT-11009](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-11009) for further discussion.; - For some `TTrees`, `RDataFrame::GetColumnNames` might now returns multiple valid spellings for a given column. For example, leaf `""l""` under branch `""b""` might now be mentioned as `""l""` as well as `""b.l""`, while only one of the two spellings might have been recognized before.; - Certain RDF-related types in the `ROOT::Detail` and `ROOT::Internal` namespaces have been renamed, most notably `RCustomColumn` is now `RDefine`. This does not impact code that only makes use of entities in the public ROOT namespace, and should not impact downstream code unless it was patching or reusing internal `RDataFrame` types. ### Notable bug fixes and improvements. - A critical issue has been fixed that could potentially result in wrong data being silently read in multi-thread runs when an input `TChain` contained more than one `TTree` coming from the _same_ input file. More details are available at [#7143](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/7143).; - The start-up time of event loops with large computation graphs with many just-in-time-compiled expressions (e.g. thousands of string `Filter`s and `Define`s) has been greatly reduced.

This behaviour is essential; when we merge ASTs from different translation units which include the same; header file(s). For example, we want to have only one definition for the class; template ``std::vector``, even if we included ``<vector>`` in several; translation units. To find a structurally equivalent node we can use the regular C/C++ lookup; functions: ``DeclContext::noload_lookup()`` and; ``DeclContext::localUncachedLookup()``. These functions do respect the C/C++; name hiding rules, thus you cannot find certain declarations in a given; declaration context. For instance, unnamed declarations (anonymous structs),; non-first ``friend`` declarations and template specializations are hidden. This; is a problem, because if we use the regular C/C++ lookup then we create; redundant AST nodes during the merge! Also, having two instances of the same; node could result in false :ref:`structural in-equivalencies <structural-eq>`; of other nodes which depend on the duplicated node. Because of these reasons,; we created a lookup class which has the sole purpose to register all; declarations, so later they can be looked up by subsequent import requests.; This is the ``ASTImporterLookupTable`` class.

This may normally happen; only if the parameter is so close to a limit (internal value at an odd; multiple of $\pm \frac{\pi}{2}$ that `Minuit` prints a warning to this; effect when it prints the parameter values. The minimized can become; blocked at a limit, because at a limit the derivative seen by the; minimized $\frac{\partial F}{\partial Pint}$ is zero no matter what the real; derivative $\frac{\partial F}{\partial Pext}$ is. $$; \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial Pint}\right) =; \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial Pext}\right); \left(\frac{\partial Pext}{\partial Pint}\right) =; \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial Pext}\right) = 0; $$. #### Getting the Right Parameter Errors with Limits. In the best case, where the minimum is far from any limits, `Minuit`; will correctly transform the error matrix, and the parameter errors it; reports should be accurate and very close to those you would have got; without limits. In other cases (which should be more common, since; otherwise you would not need limits), the very meaning of parameter; errors becomes problematic. Mathematically, since the limit is an; absolute constraint on the parameter, a parameter at its limit has no; error, at least in one direction. The error matrix, which can assign; only symmetric errors, then becomes essentially meaningless. #### Interpretation of Parameter Errors. There are two kinds of problems that can arise: the reliability of; `Minuit`'s error estimates, and their statistical interpretation,; assuming they are accurate. #### Statistical Interpretation.

While this example is somewhat silly, it illustrates the point: we want to; retain typedef information where possible, so that we can emit errors about; ""``std::string``"" instead of ""``std::basic_string<char, std:...``"". Doing this; requires properly keeping typedef information (for example, the type of ``X``; is ""``foo``"", not ""``int``""), and requires properly propagating it through the; various operators (for example, the type of ``*Y`` is ""``foo``"", not; ""``int``""). In order to retain this information, the type of these expressions; is an instance of the ``TypedefType`` class, which indicates that the type of; these expressions is a typedef for ""``foo``"". Representing types like this is great for diagnostics, because the; user-specified type is always immediately available. There are two problems; with this: first, various semantic checks need to make judgements about the; *actual structure* of a type, ignoring typedefs.

Errors fall into two broad categories:; *programmatic* and *recoverable*, with different strategies for handling and; reporting. Programmatic Errors; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Programmatic errors are violations of program invariants or API contracts, and; represent bugs within the program itself. Our aim is to document invariants, and; to abort quickly at the point of failure (providing some basic diagnostic) when; invariants are broken at runtime. The fundamental tools for handling programmatic errors are assertions and the; llvm_unreachable function. Assertions are used to express invariant conditions,; and should include a message describing the invariant:. .. code-block:: c++. assert(isPhysReg(R) && ""All virt regs should have been allocated already."");. The llvm_unreachable function can be used to document areas of control flow; that should never be entered if the program invariants hold:. .. code-block:: c++. enum { Foo, Bar, Baz } X = foo();. switch (X) {; case Foo: /* Handle Foo */; break;; case Bar: /* Handle Bar */; break;; default:; llvm_unrea",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst:16525,recover,recoverable,16525,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ProgrammersManual.rst,1,['recover'],['recoverable']

Overview:; """""""""""""""""". Reads scalar values from arbitrary memory locations and gathers them into one vector. The memory locations are provided in the vector of pointers '``ptrs``'. The memory is accessed according to the provided mask. The mask holds a bit for each vector lane, and is used to prevent memory accesses to the masked-off lanes. The masked-off lanes in the result vector are taken from the corresponding lanes of the '``passthru``' operand. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first operand is a vector of pointers which holds all memory addresses to read. The second operand is an alignment of the source addresses. It must be 0 or a power of two constant integer value. The third operand, mask, is a vector of boolean values with the same number of elements as the return type. The fourth is a pass-through value that is used to fill the masked-off lanes of the result. The return type, underlying type of the vector of pointers and the type of the '``passthru``' operand are the same vector types. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""". The '``llvm.masked.gather``' intrinsic is designed for conditional reading of multiple scalar values from arbitrary memory locations in a single IR operation. It is useful for targets that support vector masked gathers and allows vectorizing basic blocks with data and control divergence. Other targets may support this intrinsic differently, for example by lowering it into a sequence of scalar load operations.; The semantics of this operation are equivalent to a sequence of conditional scalar loads with subsequent gathering all loaded values into a single vector. The mask restricts memory access to certain lanes and facilitates vectorization of predicated basic blocks. ::. %res = call <4 x double> @llvm.masked.gather.v4f64.v4p0(<4 x ptr> %ptrs, i32 8, <4 x i1> <i1 true, i1 true, i1 true, i1",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:849906,mask,masked-off,849906,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['mask'],['masked-off']

This allows ORC to JIT; arbitrary LLVM IR, including IR produced by an ordinary static compiler (e.g.; clang) that uses constructs like symbol linkage and visibility, and weak [3]_; and common symbol definitions.

Availability,"t_sentinel:. Sentinels; ^^^^^^^^^. ``ilist``\ s have another specialty that must be considered. To be a good; citizen in the C++ ecosystem, it needs to support the standard container; operations, such as ``begin`` and ``end`` iterators, etc. Also, the; ``operator--`` must work correctly on the ``end`` iterator in the case of; non-empty ``ilist``\ s. The only sensible solution to this problem is to allocate a so-called *sentinel*; along with the intrusive list, which serves as the ``end`` iterator, providing; the back-link to the last element. However conforming to the C++ convention it; is illegal to ``operator++`` beyond the sentinel and it also must not be; dereferenced. These constraints allow for some implementation freedom to the ``ilist`` how to; allocate and store the sentinel. The corresponding policy is dictated by; ``ilist_traits<T>``. By default a ``T`` gets heap-allocated whenever the need; for a sentinel arises. While the default policy is sufficient in most cases, it may break down when; ``T`` does not provide a default constructor. Also, in the case of many; instances of ``ilist``\ s, the memory overhead of the associated sentinels is; wasted. To alleviate the situation with numerous and voluminous; ``T``-sentinels, sometimes a trick is employed, leading to *ghostly sentinels*. Ghostly sentinels are obtained by specially-crafted ``ilist_traits<T>`` which; superpose the sentinel with the ``ilist`` instance in memory. Pointer; arithmetic is used to obtain the sentinel, which is relative to the ``ilist``'s; ``this`` pointer. The ``ilist`` is augmented by an extra pointer, which serves; as the back-link of the sentinel. This is the only field in the ghostly; sentinel which can be legally accessed. .. _dss_other:.

First, ``bugpoint`` figures out which combination of optimizer; passes triggers the bug. This is useful when debugging a problem exposed by; ``opt``, for example, because it runs over 38 passes. Next, ``bugpoint`` tries removing functions from the test program, to reduce its; size. Usually it is able to reduce a test program to a single function, when; debugging intraprocedural optimizations. Once the number of functions has been; reduced, it attempts to delete various edges in the control flow graph, to; reduce the size of the function as much as possible. Finally, ``bugpoint``; deletes any individual LLVM instructions whose absence does not eliminate the; failure. At the end, ``bugpoint`` should tell you what passes crash, give you a; bitcode file, and give you instructions on how to reproduce the failure with; ``opt`` or ``llc``. .. _code generator debugger:. Code generator debugger; -----------------------. The code generator debugger attempts to narrow down the amount of code that is; being miscompiled by the selected code generator. To do this, it takes the test; program and partitions it into two pieces: one piece which it compiles with the; ""safe"" backend (into a shared object), and one piece which it runs with either; the JIT or the static LLC compiler. It uses several techniques to reduce the; amount of code pushed through the LLVM code generator, to reduce the potential; scope of the problem. After it is finished, it emits two bitcode files (called; ""test"" [to be compiled with the code generator] and ""safe"" [to be compiled with; the ""safe"" backend], respectively), and instructions for reproducing the; problem. The code generator debugger assumes that the ""safe"" backend produces; good code. .. _miscompilation debugger:.",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst:4048,failure,failure,4048,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/Bugpoint.rst,1,['failure'],['failure']

Details on how the checks; operate in the LLVM backed can be found in LLVM's documentation. By default MisExpect checking is quite strict, because the use of the; ``llvm.expect`` intrinsic is designed for specialized cases, where the outcome; of a condition is severely skewed. As a result, the optimizer can be extremely; aggressive, which can result in performance degradation if the outcome is less; predictable than the annotation suggests. Even when the annotation is correct; 90% of the time, it may be beneficial to either remove the annotation or to use; a different intrinsic that can communicate the probability more directly. Because this may be too strict, MisExpect diagnostics are not enabled by; default, and support an additional flag to tolerate some deviation from the; exact thresholds. The ``-fdiagnostic-misexpect-tolerance=N`` accepts; deviations when comparing branch weights within ``N%`` of the expected values.; So passing ``-fdiagnostic-misexpect-tolerance=5`` will not report diagnostic messages; if the branch weight from the profile is within 5% of the weight added by; the ``llvm.expect`` intrinsic.

For variable parameters with double sided limits $a$ (lower) and $b$; (upper), M uses the following transformation:. $$\begin{aligned}; P_{\mathrm{int}} &=& \arcsin; \left( 2\: \frac{ P_{\mathrm{ext}}-a}{ b-a} - 1 \right) \\; P_{\mathrm{ext}} &=& a + \frac{ b - a}{ 2}; \left( \sin P_{\mathrm{int}} + 1 \right) \end{aligned}$$. so that the internal value $P_{\mathrm{int}}$ can take on any value,; while the external value $P_{\mathrm{ext}}$ can take on values only; between the lower limit $a$ and the upper limit $b$. Since the; transformation is necessarily non-linear, it would transform a nice; linear problem into a nasty non-linear one, which is the reason why; limits should be avoided if not necessary. In addition, the; transformation does require some computer time, so it slows down the; computation a little bit, and more importantly, it introduces additional; numerical inaccuracy into the problem in addition to what is introduced; in the numerical calculation of the $\mbox{FCN}$ value. The effects; of non-linearity and numerical roundoff both become more important as; the external value gets closer to one of the limits (expressed as the; distance to nearest limit divided by distance between limits). The user; must therefore be aware of the fact that, for example, if they put limits; of $(0,10^{10})$ on a parameter, then the values $0.0$ and $1.0$ will be; indistinguishable to the accuracy of most machines. For this purpose single sided limits on parameters are provided by M ,; with their transformation being:. Lower bound $a$:. $$\begin{aligned}; P_{\mathrm{int}} &=& \pm\sqrt{(P_{\mathrm{ext}} - a + 1)^2 - 1} \\; P_{\mathrm{ext}} &=& a - 1 + \sqrt{P_{\mathrm{int}}^2 + 1} \end{aligned}$$. Upper bound $b$:. $$\begin{aligned}; P_{\mathrm{int}} &=& \pm\sqrt{(b - P_{\mathrm{ext}} + 1)^2 - 1} \\; P_{\mathrm{ext}} &=& b + 1 - \sqr",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:8950,down,down,8950,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,1,['down'],['down']

TH1. Fixed a bug in the TH1::KolmogorovTest function in the case of scaled or weighted histograms. The routine has been improved and; now could also be used for comparing an histogram with a function if it is represented as an histogram with zero errors (equivalent to the case of options ""F1"" or ""F2"" in the original HDIFF routine of HBOOK). The bug has been fixed also for the TH2 and TH3 corresponding method. In addition in the case of TH3 use now all 6 axis combinations for estimating the maximum deviation. This is consistent with what is done in the 2D case.; Improved the TH1::Chi2Test for the treatment of empty bins in the histograms. If both histograms have one empty bin, the number of degree of freedom is decreased by one but the test is performed without reporting an error. If only one histogram is having an empty bin it is considered in the comparison. Fixed a bug in preserving the global statistic information after scaling, adding or rebinning the histogram. TH2. Improve TH2::FitFitSliceX and TH2::FitFitSliceY by adding the possibility to return the generated histograms in a TObjArray when the passed pointer is not null.

ROOT installations with the build of `PyROOT` enabled are available from; the CERN `afs` cell `/afs/cern.ch/sw/root/<version>/<platform>`. To use; them, simply modify your shell environment accordingly. For Unix:. `export PATH=$ROOTSYS/bin:$PYTHONDIR/bin:$PATH`. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. `export PYTHONPATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$PYTHONPATH`. For Windows:. `set PATH=%ROOTSYS%/bin;%PYTHONDIR%/bin;%PATH%`. `set PYTHONPATH=%ROOTSYS%/bin;%PYTHONPATH%`. where `$ROOTSYS` should be set to; `/afs/cern.ch/sw/root/<version>/<platform>`, and `PYTHONDIR` to; `/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/Python/2.3.4/<platform>` with `<version>`; and `<platform>` as appropriate.

Availability,"te representation. It is not based on the; "":ref:`landingpad <i_landingpad>`"" instruction like the other two models, and is; described later in this document under :ref:`wineh`. Overview; --------. When an exception is thrown in LLVM code, the runtime does its best to find a; handler suited to processing the circumstance. The runtime first attempts to find an *exception frame* corresponding to the; function where the exception was thrown. If the programming language supports; exception handling (e.g. C++), the exception frame contains a reference to an; exception table describing how to process the exception. If the language does; not support exception handling (e.g. C), or if the exception needs to be; forwarded to a prior activation, the exception frame contains information about; how to unwind the current activation and restore the state of the prior; activation. This process is repeated until the exception is handled. If the; exception is not handled and no activations remain, then the application is; terminated with an appropriate error message. Because different programming languages have different behaviors when handling; exceptions, the exception handling ABI provides a mechanism for; supplying *personalities*. An exception handling personality is defined by; way of a *personality function* (e.g. ``__gxx_personality_v0`` in C++),; which receives the context of the exception, an *exception structure*; containing the exception object type and value, and a reference to the exception; table for the current function. The personality function for the current; compile unit is specified in a *common exception frame*. The organization of an exception table is language dependent. For C++, an; exception table is organized as a series of code ranges defining what to do if; an exception occurs in that range. Typically, the information associated with a; range defines which types of exception objects (using C++ *type info*) that are; handled in that range, and an associate",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst:4365,error,error,4365,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/ExceptionHandling.rst,1,['error'],['error']

Additionally, a program is ill-formed if it declares or; contains a call to an ``init`` method whose return type is neither ``id`` nor; a pointer to a super-class or sub-class of the declaring class (if the method; was declared on a class) or the static receiver type of the call (if it was; declared on a protocol). .. admonition:: Rationale. There are a fair number of existing methods with ``init``-like selectors; which nonetheless don't follow the ``init`` conventions. Typically these; are either accidental naming collisions or helper methods called during; initialization. Because of the peculiar retain/release behavior of; ``init`` methods, it's very important not to treat these methods as; ``init`` methods if they aren't meant to be. It was felt that implicitly; defining these methods out of the family based on the exact relationship; between the return type and the declaring class would be much too subtle; and fragile. Therefore we identify a small number of legitimate-seeming; return types and call everything else an error. This serves the secondary; purpose of encouraging programmers not to accidentally give methods names; in the ``init`` family. Note that a method with an ``init``-family selector which returns a; non-Objective-C type (e.g. ``void``) is perfectly well-formed; it simply; isn't in the ``init`` family. A program is ill-formed if a method's declarations, implementations, and; overrides do not all have the same method family. .. _arc.family.attribute:. Explicit method family control; ------------------------------. A method may be annotated with the ``objc_method_family`` attribute to; precisely control which method family it belongs to.

The second argument is; an integer or vector of integers with the same bit width as the index type; size of the first argument. Overview:; """""""""""""""""""". The ``llvm.ptrmask`` intrinsic masks out bits of the pointer according to a mask.; This allows stripping data from tagged pointers without converting them to an; integer (ptrtoint/inttoptr). As a consequence, we can preserve more information; to facilitate alias analysis and underlying-object detection. Semantics:; """""""""""""""""""".

If the pointer index type size is smaller than the pointer type size, this; implies that pointer bits beyond the index size are not affected by this; intrinsic. For integral pointers, it behaves as if the mask were extended with; 1 bits to the pointer type size. Both the returned pointer(s) and the first argument are based on the same; underlying object (for more information on the *based on* terminology see; :ref:`the pointer aliasing rules <pointeraliasing>`).

A file may become corrupted or it may be impossible to write it to disk; and close it properly. For example if the file is too large and exceeds; the disk quota, or the job crashes or a batch job reaches its time limit; before the file can be closed. In these cases, it is imperative to; recover and retain as much information as possible. ROOT provides an; intelligent and elegant file recovery mechanism using the redundant; directory information in the record header. If a file that has been not properly closed is opened again, it is; scanned and rebuilt according to the information in the record header.; The recovery algorithm reads the file and creates the saved objects in; memory according to the header information. It then rebuilds the; directory and file structure. If the file is opened in write mode, the; recovery makes the correction on disk when the file is closed; however; if the file is opened in read mode, the correction can not be written to; disk. You can also explicitly invoke the recovery procedure by calling; the `TFile::Recover()` method. You can recover the directory structure,; but you cannot save what you recovered to the file on disk. In the; following example, we interrupted and aborted the previous ROOT session,; causing the file not to be closed. When we start a new session and; attempt to open the file, it gives us an explanation and status on the; recovery attempt. ``` {.cpp}; root[] TFile f(""demo.root""); Warning in <TFile::TFile>: file demo.root probably not closed, trying to recover successfully recovered 15 keys; ```. ## The Logical ROOT File: TFile and TKey.

Availability,"text will be updated; once the API churn dies down.**. Welcome to Chapter 3 of the ""Building an ORC-based JIT in LLVM"" tutorial. This; chapter discusses lazy JITing and shows you how to enable it by adding an ORC; CompileOnDemand layer the JIT from `Chapter 2 <BuildingAJIT2.html>`_. Lazy Compilation; ================. When we add a module to the KaleidoscopeJIT class from Chapter 2 it is; immediately optimized, compiled and linked for us by the IRTransformLayer,; IRCompileLayer and RTDyldObjectLinkingLayer respectively. This scheme, where all the; work to make a Module executable is done up front, is simple to understand and; its performance characteristics are easy to reason about. However, it will lead; to very high startup times if the amount of code to be compiled is large, and; may also do a lot of unnecessary compilation if only a few compiled functions; are ever called at runtime. A truly ""just-in-time"" compiler should allow us to; defer the compilation of any given function until the moment that function is; first called, improving launch times and eliminating redundant work. In fact,; the ORC APIs provide us with a layer to lazily compile LLVM IR:; *CompileOnDemandLayer*. The CompileOnDemandLayer class conforms to the layer interface described in; Chapter 2, but its addModule method behaves quite differently from the layers; we have seen so far: rather than doing any work up front, it just scans the; Modules being added and arranges for each function in them to be compiled the; first time it is called. To do this, the CompileOnDemandLayer creates two small; utilities for each function that it scans: a *stub* and a *compile; callback*. The stub is a pair of a function pointer (which will be pointed at; the function's implementation once the function has been compiled) and an; indirect jump through the pointer. By fixing the address of the indirect jump; for the lifetime of the program we can give the function a permanent ""effective; address"", one that can be",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT3.rst:1612,redundant,redundant,1612,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT3.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/tutorial/BuildingAJIT3.rst,1,['redundant'],['redundant']

While not strictly part of the compiler, the diagnostics from Clang's; `static analyzer <https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org>`_ can also be; influenced by the user via changes to the source code. See the available; `annotations <https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/annotations.html>`_ and the; analyzer's `FAQ; page <https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/faq.html#exclude_code>`_ for more; information. .. _usersmanual-precompiled-headers:. Precompiled Headers; -------------------. `Precompiled headers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precompiled_header>`_; are a general approach employed by many compilers to reduce compilation; time. The underlying motivation of the approach is that it is common for; the same (and often large) header files to be included by multiple; source files. Consequently, compile times can often be greatly improved; by caching some of the (redundant) work done by a compiler to process; headers. Precompiled header files, which represent one of many ways to; implement this optimization, are literally files that represent an; on-disk cache that contains the vital information necessary to reduce; some of the work needed to process a corresponding header file. While; details of precompiled headers vary between compilers, precompiled; headers have been shown to be highly effective at speeding up program; compilation on systems with very large system headers (e.g., macOS). Generating a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. To generate a PCH file using Clang, one invokes Clang with the; `-x <language>-header` option. This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch.

ROOT global unchanged; >>> import ROOT; >>> print(ROOT.gDebug); 7 # still the old value (not '5'); >>> ROOT.gDebug = 3 # changes ROOT module reference; >>> gROOT.ProcessLine( 'cout << gDebug << endl;' ); 3 # ROOT global properly changed; >>>; ```.

The mapping used from private; address to physical address is:. ``wavefront-scratch-base +; (private-address * wavefront-size * 4) +; (wavefront-lane-id * 4)``. There are different ways that the wavefront scratch base address is determined; by a wavefront (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`). This; memory can be accessed in an interleaved manner using buffer instruction with; the scratch buffer descriptor and per wavefront scratch offset, by the scratch; instructions, or by flat instructions. If each lane of a wavefront accesses the; same private address, the interleaving results in adjacent dwords being accessed; and hence requires fewer cache lines to be fetched. Multi-dword access is not; supported except by flat and scratch instructions in GFX9-GFX11. The generic address space uses the hardware flat address support available in; GFX7-GFX11. This uses two fixed ranges of virtual addresses (the private and; local apertures), that are outside the range of addressible global memory, to; map from a flat address to a private or local address. FLAT instructions can take a flat address and access global, private (scratch); and group (LDS) memory depending on if the address is within one of the; aperture ranges.

If the expression; appears on the left-hand side of a compound assignment operator (e.g.; +=), the program is ill-formed, because the result of reading an element; is always an Objective-C object pointer and no binary operators are; legal on such pointers.

Availability,"the time is measured for an in-place matrix inversion. Except for `ROOT v3.10`, the algorithms are all based on an; `LU `factorization followed by forward/back-substitution. `ROOT v3.10`; is using the slower Gaussian elimination method. The numerical accuracy; of the `CLHEP` routine is poor:. - up to 6x6 the numerical imprecise Cramer multiplication is hard-coded.; For instance, calculating `U=H*H-1`, where `H` is a (5x5) Hilbert; matrix, results in off-diagonal elements of $10^{-7}$ instead of the $10^{-13}$; using an `LU `according to `Crout`. - scaling protection is non-existent and limits are hard-coded, as a; consequence inversion of a Hilbert matrix for `sizes>(12x12)` fails. In; order to gain speed the `CLHEP` algorithm stores its permutation info of; the pivots points in a static array, making multi-threading not; possible. `GSL` uses LU decomposition without the implicit scaling of `Crout`.; Therefore, its accuracy is not as good. For instance a (10x10) Hilbert; matrix has errors 10 times larger than the `LU Crout` result. In; `ROOT v4.0`, the user can choose between the `Invert()` and; `IvertFast()` routines, where the latter is using the Cramer algorithm; for `sizes<7x7`.

In the absence of native support, a type can still be; supported if the compiler can emulate arithmetic on the type by promoting; to ``float``; see below for more information on this emulation. * ``__fp16`` is supported on all targets. The special semantics of this; type mean that no arithmetic is ever performed directly on ``__fp16`` values;; see below. * ``_Float16`` is supported on the following targets:. * 32-bit ARM (natively on some architecture versions); * 64-bit ARM (AArch64) (natively on ARMv8.2a and above); * AMDGPU (natively); * SPIR (natively); * X86 (if SSE2 is available; natively if AVX512-FP16 is also available); * RISC-V (natively if Zfh or Zhinx is available). * ``__bf16`` is supported on the following targets (currently never natively):. * 32-bit ARM; * 64-bit ARM (AArch64); * RISC-V; * X86 (when SSE2 is available). (For X86, SSE2 is available on 64-bit and all recent 32-bit processors.). ``__fp16`` and ``_Float16`` both use the binary16 format from IEEE; 754-2008, which provides a 5-bit exponent and an 11-bit significand; (counting the implicit leading 1). ``__bf16`` uses the `bfloat16; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format>`_ format,; which provides an 8-bit exponent and an 8-bit significand; this is the same; exponent range as `float`, just with greatly reduced precision. ``_Float16`` and ``__bf16`` follow the usual rules for arithmetic; floating-point types. Most importantly, this means that arithmetic operations; on operands of these types are formally performed in the type and produce; values of the type. ``__fp16`` does not follow those rules: most operations; immediately promote operands of type ``__fp16`` to ``float``, and so; arithmetic operations are defined to be performed in ``float`` and so result in; a value of type ``",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst:31103,avail,available,31103,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/LanguageExtensions.rst,1,['avail'],['available']
Availability,"then uses; SEH (``__try / __except``) to resume execution with new information in the child; frame. In other words, the successive unwinding approach is incompatible with Visual; C++ exceptions and general purpose Windows exception handling. Because the C++; exception object lives in stack memory, LLVM cannot provide a custom personality; function that uses landingpads. Similarly, SEH does not provide any mechanism; to rethrow an exception or continue unwinding. Therefore, LLVM must use the IR; constructs described later in this document to implement compatible exception; handling. SEH filter expressions; -----------------------. The SEH personality functions also use funclets to implement filter expressions,; which allow executing arbitrary user code to decide which exceptions to catch.; Filter expressions should not be confused with the ``filter`` clause of the LLVM; ``landingpad`` instruction. Typically filter expressions are used to determine; if the exception came from a particular DLL or code region, or if code faulted; while accessing a particular memory address range. LLVM does not currently have; IR to represent filter expressions because it is difficult to represent their; control dependencies. Filter expressions run during the first phase of EH,; before cleanups run, making it very difficult to build a faithful control flow; graph. For now, the new EH instructions cannot represent SEH filter; expressions, and frontends must outline them ahead of time. Local variables of; the parent function can be escaped and accessed using the ``llvm.localescape``; and ``llvm.localrecover`` intrinsics. New exception handling instructions; ------------------------------------.

Availability,"throw exceptions. Code Organization; -----------------. Implementations of the Support Library interface are separated by their general; class of operating system. Currently only Unix and Win32 classes are defined; but more could be added for other operating system classifications. To; distinguish which implementation to compile, the code in ``lib/Support`` uses; the ``LLVM_ON_UNIX`` and ``_WIN32`` ``#defines``. Each source file in; ``lib/Support``, after implementing the generic (operating system independent); functionality needs to include the correct implementation using a set of; ``#if defined(LLVM_ON_XYZ)`` directives. For example, if we had; ``lib/Support/Path.cpp``, we'd expect to see in that file:. .. code-block:: c++. #if defined(LLVM_ON_UNIX); #include ""Unix/Path.inc""; #endif; #if defined(_WIN32); #include ""Windows/Path.inc""; #endif. The implementation in ``lib/Support/Unix/Path.inc`` should handle all Unix; variants. The implementation in ``lib/Support/Windows/Path.inc`` should handle; all Windows variants. What this does is quickly inc the basic class; of operating system that will provide the implementation. The specific details; for a given platform must still be determined through the use of ``#ifdef``. Consistent Semantics; --------------------. The implementation of a ``lib/Support`` interface can vary drastically between; platforms. That's okay as long as the end result of the interface function is; the same. For example, a function to create a directory is pretty straight; forward on all operating system. System V IPC on the other hand isn't even; supported on all platforms. Instead of ""supporting"" System V IPC,; ``lib/Support`` should provide an interface to the basic concept of; inter-process communications. The implementations might use System V IPC if; that was available or named pipes, or whatever gets the job done effectively; for a given operating system.

Availability,"ting an inlined function is a bit more work, fortunately broken up into; reasonable steps:. 1. The CoreEngine realizes we're at the end of an inlined call and generates a; CallExitBegin node. 2. ExprEngine takes over (in processCallExit) and finds the return value of the; function, if it has one. This is bound to the expression that triggered the; call. (In the case of calls without origin expressions, such as destructors,; this step is skipped.). 3. Dead symbols and bindings are cleaned out from the state, including any local; bindings. 4. A CallExitEnd node is generated, which marks the transition back to the; caller's LocationContext. 5. Custom post-call checks are processed and the final nodes are pushed back; onto the work list, so that evaluation of the caller can continue. Retry Without Inlining; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In some cases, we would like to retry analysis without inlining a particular; call. Currently, we use this technique to recover coverage in case we stop; analyzing a path due to exceeding the maximum block count inside an inlined; function. When this situation is detected, we walk up the path to find the first node; before inlining was started and enqueue it on the WorkList with a special; ReplayWithoutInlining bit added to it (ExprEngine::replayWithoutInlining). The; path is then re-analyzed from that point without inlining that particular call. Deciding When to Inline; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. In general, the analyzer attempts to inline as much as possible, since it; provides a better summary of what actually happens in the program. There are; some cases, however, where the analyzer chooses not to inline:. - If there is no definition available for the called function or method. In; this case, there is no opportunity to inline. - If the CFG cannot be constructed for a called function, or the liveness; cannot be computed.

Availability,"tion describes some of the important classes. There are also a number; of important subsystems that interact at this layer, they are described later in; this manual. .. _MCStreamer:. The ``MCStreamer`` API; ----------------------. MCStreamer is best thought of as an assembler API. It is an abstract API which; is *implemented* in different ways (e.g. to output a .s file, output an ELF .o; file, etc) but whose API correspond directly to what you see in a .s file.; MCStreamer has one method per directive, such as EmitLabel, EmitSymbolAttribute,; switchSection, emitValue (for .byte, .word), etc, which directly correspond to; assembly level directives. It also has an EmitInstruction method, which is used; to output an MCInst to the streamer. This API is most important for two clients: the llvm-mc stand-alone assembler is; effectively a parser that parses a line, then invokes a method on MCStreamer. In; the code generator, the `Code Emission`_ phase of the code generator lowers; higher level LLVM IR and Machine* constructs down to the MC layer, emitting; directives through MCStreamer. On the implementation side of MCStreamer, there are two major implementations:; one for writing out a .s file (MCAsmStreamer), and one for writing out a .o; file (MCObjectStreamer). MCAsmStreamer is a straightforward implementation; that prints out a directive for each method (e.g. ``EmitValue -> .byte``), but; MCObjectStreamer implements a full assembler. For target specific directives, the MCStreamer has a MCTargetStreamer instance.; Each target that needs it defines a class that inherits from it and is a lot; like MCStreamer itself: It has one method per directive and two classes that; inherit from it, a target object streamer and a target asm streamer. The target; asm streamer just prints it (``emitFnStart -> .fnstart``), and the object; streamer implement the assembler logic for it. To make llvm use these classes, the target initialization must call; TargetRegistry::RegisterAsmStreamer a",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst:27630,down,down,27630,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,1,['down'],['down']

INSTRUMENT REGIONS; ------------------. An InstrumentRegion describes a region of assembly code guarded by; special LLVM-MCA comment directives. .. code-block:: none. # LLVM-MCA-<INSTRUMENT_TYPE> <data>; ... ## asm. where `INSTRUMENT_TYPE` is a type defined by the target and expects; to use `data`. A comment starting with substring `LLVM-MCA-<INSTRUMENT_TYPE>`; brings data into scope for llvm-mca to use in its analysis for; all following instructions. If a comment with the same `INSTRUMENT_TYPE` is found later in the; instruction list, then the original InstrumentRegion will be; automatically ended, and a new InstrumentRegion will begin. If there are comments containing the different `INSTRUMENT_TYPE`,; then both data sets remain available. In contrast with an AnalysisRegion,; an InstrumentRegion does not need a comment to end the region. Comments that are prefixed with `LLVM-MCA-` but do not correspond to; a valid `INSTRUMENT_TYPE` for the target cause an error, except for; `BEGIN` and `END`, since those correspond to AnalysisRegions. Comments; that do not start with `LLVM-MCA-` are ignored by :program `llvm-mca`. An instruction (a MCInst) is added to an InstrumentRegion R only; if its location is in range [R.RangeStart, R.RangeEnd]. On RISCV targets, vector instructions have different behaviour depending; on the LMUL. Code can be instrumented with a comment that takes the; following form:. .. code-block:: none. # LLVM-MCA-RISCV-LMUL <M1|M2|M4|M8|MF2|MF4|MF8>.

This instruction is designed to operate as a standard '``call``'; instruction in most regards. The primary difference is that it; establishes an association with a label, which is used by the runtime; library to unwind the stack. This instruction is used in languages with destructors to ensure that; proper cleanup is performed in the case of either a ``longjmp`` or a; thrown exception. Additionally, this is important for implementation of; '``catch``' clauses in high-level languages that support them. For the purposes of the SSA form, the definition of the value returned; by the '``invoke``' instruction is deemed to occur on the edge from the; current block to the ""normal"" label.

This function implements a very simple parser for the kinds of strings we are; interested in. Although it has some holes (it allows ""``123KKK``"" for example),; it is good enough for this example. Note that we use the option itself to print; out the error message (the ``error`` method always returns true) in order to get; a nice error message (shown below).

These are explained in details in the section; ""Visualization Settings and Attributes"". At this point, you will; probably like to see how this geometry looks like.

A bounds annotation including an internal bounds annotation; (i.e., ``__indexable`` and ``__bidi_indexable``) doesn't affect the alignment of; the original pointer.

While; details of precompiled headers vary between compilers, precompiled; headers have been shown to be highly effective at speeding up program; compilation on systems with very large system headers (e.g., macOS). Generating a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. To generate a PCH file using Clang, one invokes Clang with the; `-x <language>-header` option. This mirrors the interface in GCC; for generating PCH files:. .. code-block:: console. $ gcc -x c-header test.h -o test.h.gch; $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch. Using a PCH File; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. A PCH file can then be used as a prefix header when a ``-include-pch``; option is passed to ``clang``:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -include-pch test.h.pch test.c -o test. The ``clang`` driver will check if the PCH file ``test.h.pch`` is; available; if so, the contents of ``test.h`` (and the files it includes); will be processed from the PCH file. Otherwise, Clang will report an error. .. note::. Clang does *not* automatically use PCH files for headers that are directly; included within a source file or indirectly via :option:`-include`.; For example:. .. code-block:: console. $ clang -x c-header test.h -o test.h.pch; $ cat test.c; #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``. Relocatable PCH Files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. It is sometimes necessary to build a precompiled header from headers; that are not yet in their final, installed locations. For example, one; might build a precompiled header within the build tree that is then; meant to be installed alongside the headers.

In such cases, it; is profitable to make the non-failing case cheaper even if it makes; the failing case significantly more expensive. This asymmetry can be; exploited by folding such safety checks into operations that can be; made to fault reliably if the check would have failed, and recovering; from such a fault by using a signal handler. For example, Java requires null checks on objects before they are read; from or written to. If the object is ``null`` then a; ``NullPointerException`` has to be thrown, interrupting normal; execution. In practice, however, dereferencing a ``null`` pointer is; extremely rare in well-behaved Java programs, and typically the null; check can be folded into a nearby memory operation that operates on; the same memory location.

Introduction; ------------. LibASTMatchers provides a domain specific language to create predicates on; Clang's AST. This DSL is written in and can be used from C++, allowing users; to write a single program to both match AST nodes and access the node's C++; interface to extract attributes, source locations, or any other information; provided on the AST level. AST matchers are predicates on nodes in the AST. Matchers are created by; calling creator functions that allow building up a tree of matchers, where; inner matchers are used to make the match more specific. For example, to create a matcher that matches all class or union declarations; in the AST of a translation unit, you can call `recordDecl(); <LibASTMatchersReference.html#recordDecl0Anchor>`_. To narrow the match down,; for example to find all class or union declarations with the name ""``Foo``"",; insert a `hasName <LibASTMatchersReference.html#hasName0Anchor>`_ matcher: the; call ``recordDecl(hasName(""Foo""))`` returns a matcher that matches classes or; unions that are named ""``Foo``"", in any namespace. By default, matchers that; accept multiple inner matchers use an implicit `allOf(); <LibASTMatchersReference.html#allOf0Anchor>`_. This allows further narrowing; down the match, for example to match all classes that are derived from; ""``Bar``"": ``recordDecl(hasName(""Foo""), isDerivedFrom(""Bar""))``. How to create a matcher; -----------------------. With more than a thousand classes in the Clang AST, one can quickly get lost; when trying to figure out how to create a matcher for a specific pattern. This; section will teach you how to use a rigorous step-by-step pattern to build the; matcher you are interested in. Note that there will always be matchers missing; for some part of the AST.

Like OpenCL, HLSL relies on capturing a lot of information into IR metadata.; *hand wave* *hand wave* *hand wave* As a design principle here we want our IR to; be idiomatic Clang IR as much as possible. We will use IR attributes wherever we; can, and use metadata as sparingly as possible. One example of a difference from; DXC already implemented in Clang is the use of target triples to communicate; shader model versions and shader stages. Our HLSL CodeGen implementation should also have an eye toward generating IR; that will map directly to targets other than DXIL. While IR itself is generally; not re-targetable, we want to share the Clang CodeGen implementation for HLSL; with other GPU graphics targets like SPIR-V and possibly other GPU and even CPU; targets. HLSL Language; =============. The HLSL language is insufficiently documented, and not formally specified.; Documentation is available on `Microsoft's website; <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl>`_.; The language syntax is similar enough to C and C++ that carefully written C and; C++ code is valid HLSL. HLSL has some key differences from C & C++ which we will; need to handle in Clang. HLSL is not a conforming or valid extension or superset of C or C++. The; language has key incompatibilities with C and C++, both syntactically and; semantically. An Aside on GPU Languages; -------------------------.

In; this method a number of curves is calculated with variations of the; parameter values, as sampled from a multi-variate Gaussian p.d.f. that; is constructed from the fit results covariance matrix. The error(x); is determined by calculating a central interval that capture N% of the; variations for each value of x, where N% is controlled by Z (i.e. Z=1; gives N=68%). The number of sampling curves is chosen to be such that; at least 100 curves are expected to be outside the N% interval. Intervals from; the sampling method can be asymmetric, and may perform better in the; presence of strong correlations, but may take (much) longer to; calculate. The sampling method also assumes that the uncertainty on the; parameters can modeled by a multi-variate Gaussian distribution. A complete example is provided in a new tutorial macro rf610_visualerror.C,; the output of which is shown below.

The second is an unsigned; LEB128 integer DR that represents the byte offset of a debugging information; entry D relative to the beginning of the current compilation unit, that; provides the type T of the register value. The operation is equivalent to performing ``DW_OP_regx R; DW_OP_deref_type; DR``. .. note::. Should DWARF allow the type T to be a larger size than the size of the; register R? Restricting a larger bit size avoids any issue of conversion; as the, possibly truncated, bit contents of the register is simply; interpreted as a value of T. If a conversion is wanted it can be done; explicitly using a ``DW_OP_convert`` operation. GDB has a per register hook that allows a target specific conversion on a; register by register basis. It defaults to truncation of bigger registers.; Removing use of the target hook does not cause any test failures in common; architectures. If the compiler for a target architecture did want some; form of conversion, including a larger result type, it could always; explicitly use the ``DW_OP_convert`` operation. If T is a larger type than the register size, then the default GDB; register hook reads bytes from the next register (or reads out of bounds; for the last register!). Removing use of the target hook does not cause; any test failures in common architectures (except an illegal hand written; assembly test). If a target architecture requires this behavior, these; extensions allow a composite location description to be used to combine; multiple registers. 2. ``DW_OP_deref``.

The infectious nature of error types means that an; attempt to change one of these functions to return ``Error`` or ``Expected<T>``; instead often results in an avalanche of changes to callers, callers of callers,; and so on. (The first such attempt, returning an ``Error`` from; MachOObjectFile's constructor, was abandoned after the diff reached 3000 lines,; impacted half a dozen libraries, and was still growing). To solve this problem, the ``Error``/``std::error_code`` interoperability requirement was; introduced.

If your data is stored on a local disk, the system may cache some/all of the file in memory after it is; first read. If this is realistic of how your analysis will run - then there is no concern. However, if; you expect to only read files once in a while - and as such the files are unlikely to be in the cache -; consider clearing the cache before running rootreadspeed.; On Linux this can be done by running 'echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches' as a superuser,; or a specific file can be dropped from the cache with; `dd of=<FILENAME> oflag=nocache conv=notrunc,fdatasync count=0 > /dev/null 2>&1`. ### Known overhead of TTreeReader, RDataFrame. `rootreadspeed` is designed to read all data present in the specified branches, trees and files at the highest; possible speed. When the application bottleneck is not in the computations performed by analysis logic,; higher-level interfaces built on top of TTree such as TTreeReader and RDataFrame are known to add a significant; runtime overhead with respect to the runtimes reported by `rootreadspeed` (up to a factor 2). In realistic analysis; applications it has been observed that a large part of that overhead is compensated by the ability of TTreeReader and; RDataFrame to read branch values selectively, based on event cuts, and this overhead will be reduced significantly; when using RDataFrame in conjunction with RNTuple.; See also [this talk](https://indico.cern.ch/e/PPP138) (slides 16 to 19).; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/readspeed/README.md:3826,echo,echo,3826,tree/readspeed/README.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/tree/readspeed/README.md,1,['echo'],['echo']

If the source language is mapped onto the AMDGPU wavefronts in a SIMT manner the; compiler can use the AMDGPU execution mask register to control which lanes are; active. To describe the conceptual location of non-active lanes requires an; attribute that has an expression that computes the source location PC for each; lane. For efficiency, the expression calculates the source location the wavefront as a; whole. This can be done using the ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` (see; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-to-create-vector-composite-location-descriptions`); operation. The AMDGPU may update the execution mask to perform whole wavefront operations.; Therefore, there is a need for an attribute that computes the current active; lane mask. This can have an expression that may evaluate to the SIMT active lane; mask register or to a saved mask when in whole wavefront execution mode. An example that uses these attributes is referenced in the; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-further-examples` appendix. See ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` and ``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane`` in; :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-composite-location-description-operations`. 2.14 Define Source Language Memory Classes; -------------------------------------------.

Availability,"to; the Clang front-end. First, in general, we prefer the AST to retain the source; code as close to how the user wrote it as possible. This means that if they; wrote ""``5+4``"", we want to keep the addition and two constants in the AST, we; don't want to fold to ""``9``"". This means that constant folding in various; ways turns into a tree walk that needs to handle the various cases. However, there are places in both C and C++ that require constants to be; folded. For example, the C standard defines what an ""integer constant; expression"" (i-c-e) is with very precise and specific requirements. The; language then requires i-c-e's in a lot of places (for example, the size of a; bitfield, the value for a case statement, etc). For these, we have to be able; to constant fold the constants, to do semantic checks (e.g., verify bitfield; size is non-negative and that case statements aren't duplicated). We aim for; Clang to be very pedantic about this, diagnosing cases when the code does not; use an i-c-e where one is required, but accepting the code unless running with; ``-pedantic-errors``. Things get a little bit more tricky when it comes to compatibility with; real-world source code. Specifically, GCC has historically accepted a huge; superset of expressions as i-c-e's, and a lot of real world code depends on; this unfortunate accident of history (including, e.g., the glibc system; headers). GCC accepts anything its ""fold"" optimizer is capable of reducing to; an integer constant, which means that the definition of what it accepts changes; as its optimizer does. One example is that GCC accepts things like ""``case; X-X:``"" even when ``X`` is a variable, because it can fold this to 0.

Availability,"token. .. _Lexer:. The ``Lexer`` class; -------------------. The ``Lexer`` class provides the mechanics of lexing tokens out of a source; buffer and deciding what they mean. The ``Lexer`` is complicated by the fact; that it operates on raw buffers that have not had spelling eliminated (this is; a necessity to get decent performance), but this is countered with careful; coding as well as standard performance techniques (for example, the comment; handling code is vectorized on X86 and PowerPC hosts). The lexer has a couple of interesting modal features:. * The lexer can operate in ""raw"" mode. This mode has several features that; make it possible to quickly lex the file (e.g., it stops identifier lookup,; doesn't specially handle preprocessor tokens, handles EOF differently, etc).; This mode is used for lexing within an ""``#if 0``"" block, for example.; * The lexer can capture and return comments as tokens. This is required to; support the ``-C`` preprocessor mode, which passes comments through, and is; used by the diagnostic checker to identifier expect-error annotations.; * The lexer can be in ``ParsingFilename`` mode, which happens when; preprocessing after reading a ``#include`` directive. This mode changes the; parsing of ""``<``"" to return an ""angled string"" instead of a bunch of tokens; for each thing within the filename.; * When parsing a preprocessor directive (after ""``#``"") the; ``ParsingPreprocessorDirective`` mode is entered. This changes the parser to; return EOD at a newline.; * The ``Lexer`` uses a ``LangOptions`` object to know whether trigraphs are; enabled, whether C++ or ObjC keywords are recognized, etc. In addition to these modes, the lexer keeps track of a couple of other features; that are local to a lexed buffer, which change as the buffer is lexed:. * The ``Lexer`` uses ``BufferPtr`` to keep track of the current character being; lexed.; * The ``Lexer`` uses ``IsAtStartOfLine`` to keep track of whether the next; lexed token will start with its ""st",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:54382,error,error,54382,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"tolerance parameter `fTol` (a member of the base class; **`TDecompBase`**) plays a crucial role in all operations of the; decomposition classes. It gives the user a tool to monitor and steer the; operations its default value is $\varepsilon$ where $1+\varepsilon=1$. If you do not want to be bothered by the following considerations, like; in most other linear algebra packages, just set the tolerance with; `SetTol` to an arbitrary small number. The tolerance number is used by; each decomposition method to decide whether the matrix is near singular,; except of course SVD that can handle singular matrices. This will be; checked in a different way for any decomposition. For instance in LU, a; matrix is considered singular in the solving stage when a diagonal; element of the decomposed matrix is smaller than `fTol`. Here an; important point is raised. The `Decompose()` method is successful as; long no zero diagonal element is encountered. Therefore, the user could; perform decomposition and only after this step worry about the tolerance; number. If the matrix is flagged as being singular, operations with the; decomposition will fail and will return matrices or vectors that are; invalid. If one would like to monitor the tolerance parameter but not; have the code stop in case of a number smaller than `fTol`, one could; proceed as follows:. ``` {.cpp}; TVectorD b = ..;; TMatrixD a = ..;; .; TDecompLU lu(a);; Bool_t ok;; TVectorD x = lu.Solve(b,ok);; Int_t nr = 0;; while (!ok) {; lu.SetMatrix(a);; lu.SetTol(0.1*lu.GetTol());; if (nr++ > 10) break;; x = lu.Solve(b,ok);; }; if (x.IsValid()); cout << ""solved with tol ="" << lu.GetTol() << endl;; else; cout << ""solving failed "" << endl;; ```. The observant reader will notice that by scaling the complete matrix by; some small number the decomposition will detect a singular matrix. In; this case, the user will have to reduce the tolerance number by this; factor.

Availability,"tory to; use the API calls instead of calls like __builtin_ia32_paddw128. Lvalue casts. Old versions of GCC permit casting the left-hand side of an assignment to a; different type. Clang produces an error on similar code, e.g.,. lvalue.c:2:3: error: assignment to cast is illegal, lvalue casts are not supported; (int*)addr = val;; ^~~~~~~~~~ ~. To fix this problem, move the cast to the right-hand side. In this; example, one could use:. addr = (float *)val;. Jumps to within __block variable scope. Clang disallows jumps into the scope of a __block; variable. Variables marked with __block require special; runtime initialization. A jump into the scope of a __block; variable bypasses this initialization, leaving the variable's metadata; in an invalid state. Consider the following code fragment:. int fetch_object_state(struct MyObject *c) {; if (!c->active) goto error;. __block int result;; run_specially_somehow(^{ result = c->state; });; return result;. error:; fprintf(stderr, ""error while fetching object state"");; return -1;; }. GCC accepts this code, but it produces code that will usually crash; when result goes out of scope if the jump is taken. (It's; possible for this bug to go undetected because it often won't crash if; the stack is fresh, i.e. still zeroed.) Therefore, Clang rejects this; code with a hard error:. t.c:3:5: error: goto into protected scope; goto error;; ^; t.c:5:15: note: jump bypasses setup of __block variable; __block int result;; ^. The fix is to rewrite the code to not require jumping into a; __block variable's scope, e.g. by limiting that scope:. {; __block int result;; run_specially_somehow(^{ result = c->state; });; return result;; }. Non-initialization of __block; variables. In the following example code, the x variable is used before it is; defined:. int f0() {; __block int x;; return ^(){ return x; }();; }.

Prefix data is data associated with a function which the code; generator will emit immediately before the function's entrypoint.; The purpose of this feature is to allow frontends to associate; language-specific runtime metadata with specific functions and make it; available through the function pointer while still allowing the; function pointer to be called. To access the data for a given function, a program may bitcast the; function pointer to a pointer to the constant's type and dereference; index -1. This implies that the IR symbol points just past the end of; the prefix data. For instance, take the example of a function annotated; with a single ``i32``,. .. code-block:: llvm. define void @f() prefix i32 123 { ... }. The prefix data can be referenced as,. .. code-block:: llvm. %a = getelementptr inbounds i32, ptr @f, i32 -1; %b = load i32, ptr %a.

Availability,"trivial to destroy exists at that location, the program has; undefined behavior. .. admonition:: Rationale. While these rules are far less fine-grained than C++, they are; nonetheless sufficient to express a wide spectrum of types.; Types that express some sort of ownership will generally be non-trivial; to both copy and destroy and either non-trivial or illegal to; default-initialize. Types that don't express ownership may still; be non-trivial to copy because of some sort of address sensitivity;; for example, a relative reference. Distinguishing default; initialization allows types to impose policies about how they are; created. These rules assume that assignment into an l-value is always a; modification of an existing object rather than an initialization.; Assignment is then a compound operation where the old value is; read and destroyed, if necessary, and the new value is put into; place. These are the natural semantics of value propagation, where; all basic operations on the type come down to copies and destroys,; and everything else is just an optimization on top of those. The most glaring weakness of programming with non-trivial types in C; is that there are no language mechanisms (akin to C++'s placement; ``new`` and explicit destructor calls) for explicitly creating and; destroying objects. Clang should consider adding builtins for this; purpose, as well as for common optimizations like destructive; relocation. Application of the formal C rules to nontrivial ownership qualifiers; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Nontrivially ownership-qualified types are considered non-trivial; to copy, destroy, and default-initialize. A dynamic object of nontrivially ownership-qualified type contingently; exists at a location if the memory is filled with a zero pattern, e.g.; by ``calloc`` or ``bzero``.

However, it gives no reliable; information about parameter errors, no information whatsoever about; parameter correlations, and worst of all cannot be expected to converge; accurately to the minimum in a finite time.

The register allocator must; make sure that none of them are overwritten by the values of virtual registers; while still alive. Mapping virtual registers to physical registers; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. There are two ways to map virtual registers to physical registers (or to memory; slots). The first way, that we will call *direct mapping*, is based on the use; of methods of the classes ``TargetRegisterInfo``, and ``MachineOperand``. The; second way, that we will call *indirect mapping*, relies on the ``VirtRegMap``; class in order to insert loads and stores sending and getting values to and from; memory. The direct mapping provides more flexibility to the developer of the register; allocator; however, it is more error prone, and demands more implementation; work. Basically, the programmer will have to specify where load and store; instructions should be inserted in the target function being compiled in order; to get and store values in memory. To assign a physical register to a virtual; register present in a given operand, use ``MachineOperand::setReg(p_reg)``. To; insert a store instruction, use ``TargetInstrInfo::storeRegToStackSlot(...)``,; and to insert a load instruction, use ``TargetInstrInfo::loadRegFromStackSlot``. The indirect mapping shields the application developer from the complexities of; inserting load and store instructions. In order to map a virtual register to a; physical one, use ``VirtRegMap::assignVirt2Phys(vreg, preg)``. In order to map; a certain virtual register to memory, use; ``VirtRegMap::assignVirt2StackSlot(vreg)``. This method will return the stack; slot where ``vreg``'s value will be located.

M cannot do this itself, but it can provide some; hints (contours, global correlation coefficients, eigenvalues) which; can help the clever user to find out what is wrong. - **Numerical inaccuracies.** It is possible that the apparent lack of; positive–definiteness is in fact only due to excessive roundoff; errors in numerical calculations, either in $\mbox{FCN}$ or in M; . This is unlikely in general, but becomes more likely if the number; of free parameters is very large, or if the parameters are badly; scaled (not all of the same order of magnitude), and correlations; are also large. In any case, whether the non–positive–definiteness; is real or only numerical is largely irrelevant, since in both cases; the error matrix will be unreliable and the minimum suspicious. ## Additional trouble–shooting ##.

Static values of the parameter exist and can be set and retrieved via corresponding static methods.; Fitting Classes: improve in general all classes in view of using them in the histogram and graph fitting routines. Few bugs have been as well fixed (see the cvs log for details). The fitter class, ROOT::Fit::Fitter is used now to implement the fit functionality of the Hist library (i.e. TH1::Fit, TGraph::Fit/; ; The Fitter class has been changed to retain a pointer to the Minimizer and Objective function of the last fit. The objective function depends on a reference to the data and the model function, therefore the objective function pointer is valid as far the data and the model function are maintained alive.; ; The library provides the implementation of standard objective function like the Chi2 function, the Poisson likelihood function (for binned likelihood fits) and the loh likelihood function (for unbinned fits). These standard objective functions can be created with or without gradient functionality. In the first case the minimization will be performed using the gradient provided by the function.

In; the example here, we use data from the file `ExampleData.txt` in text; format:. ``` {.cpp}; root [0] TGraphErrors gr(""ExampleData.txt"");; root [1] gr.Draw(""AP"");; ```. You should see the output shown in Figure [2.2](#f22).

Make sure the file `ExampleData.txt` is available in the directory from; which you started ROOT. Inspect this file now with your favourite; editor, or use the command `less ExampleData.txt` to inspect the file,; you will see that the format is very simple and easy to understand.; Lines beginning with `#` are ignored. It is very convenient to add some; comments about the type of data. The data itself consist of lines with; four real numbers each, representing the x- and y- coordinates and their; errors of each data point. The argument of the method `Draw(""AP"")` is important here. Behind the scenes,; it tells the `TGraphPainter` class to show the axes and to plot markers at the; *x* and *y* positions of the specified data points. Note that this simple; example relies on the default settings of ROOT, concerning the size of; the canvas holding the plot, the marker type and the line colours and; thickness used and so on. In a well-written, complete example, all this; would need to be specified explicitly in order to obtain nice and well; readable results.

A lot of the ""back end; optimization"" happens right along with other data optimizations (ie, CSE; of machine specific things). As far as REAL back end optimizations go, it looks something like this:. 1. Instruction combination: try to make CISCy instructions, if available; 2.

For example, try to get; the first argument of a function to naturally land in %o0 for sparc.; 3. Instruction scheduling: 'nuff said :); 4. Register class preferencing: ??; 5.

Formula expressions are now used to create functions which are passed to Cling to be Just In Time compiled.; The expression is therefore compiled using Clang/LLVVM which will give execution time as compiled code and in addition correctness of the result obtained.; - This class is not 100% backward compatible with the old TFormula class, which is still available in ROOT as =ROOT::v5::TFormula=.; Some of the TFormula member funtions available in version 5, such as =Analyze= and =AnalyzeFunction= are not available in the new TFormula class.; On the other hand formula expressions which were valid in version 5 are still valid in TFormula version 6; - TFormula is not anymore a base class for TF1. ### TF1. - Change of its inheritance structure. `TF1` has not anymore `TFormula` as a base class, so this code. ``` {.cpp}; TF1 * f1 = new TF1(""f1"",""f1"",""sin(x)"",0,10);; TFormula * formula = (TFormula *) f1;; ```. **it is not valid anymore.**; The equivalent correct code is now. ``` {.cpp}; TF1 * f1 = new TF1(""f1"",""f1"",""sin(x)"",0,10);; TFormula * formula = f1->GetFormula();; ```. ### TGraph2DPainter. - In some case and extra point was drawn in the center od the plot when a; `TGRaph2d`was drawn with `P`, `P0`, or `PCOL` options. ### THistPainter. - It was possible to interactively zoom outside the histograms' limits.

It is therefore expected that this; limitation cannot be eliminated with the usage of any parallel analysis; toolkit. ### Optimisation Regarding N-tuples ###. ROOT automatically applies compression algorithms on n-tuples to reduce; the memory consumption. A value that is in most cases the same will; consume only small space on your disk (but it has to be decompressed on; reading). Nevertheless, you should think about the design of your; n-tuples and your analyses as soon as the processing time exceeds some; minutes. - Try to keep your n-tuples simple and use appropriate variable types.; If your measurement has only a limited precision, it is needless to; store it with double precision. - Experimental conditions that do not change with every single; measurement should be stored in a separate tree. Although the; compression can handle redundant values, the processing time; increase with every variable that has to be filled. - The function `SetCacheSize(long)` specifies the size of the cache; for reading a `TTree` object from a file. The default value is 30MB.; A manual increase may help in certain situations. Please note that; the caching mechanism can cover only one `TTree` object per `TFile`; object. - You can select the branches to be covered by the caching algorithm; with `AddBranchToCache` and deactivate unneeded branches with; `SetBranchStatus`. This mechanism can result in a significant; speed-up for simple operations on trees with many branches. - You can measure the performance easily with `TTreePerfStats`. The; ROOT documentation on this class also includes an introductory; example. For example, `TTreePerfStats` can show you that it is; beneficial to store meta data and payload data separately, i.e.; write the meta data tree in a bulk to a file at the end of your job; instead of writing both trees interleaved.

The job of ``classof`` is to dynamically determine whether an object of; a base class is in fact of a particular derived class. In order to; downcast a type ``Base`` to a type ``Derived``, there needs to be a; ``classof`` in ``Derived`` which will accept an object of type ``Base``. To be concrete, consider the following code:. .. code-block:: c++. Shape *S = ...;; if (isa<Circle>(S)) {; /* do something ... */; }. The code of the ``isa<>`` test in this code will eventually boil; down---after template instantiation and some other machinery---to a; check roughly like ``Circle::classof(S)``. For more information, see; :ref:`classof-contract`. The argument to ``classof`` should always be an *ancestor* class because; the implementation has logic to allow and optimize away; upcasts/up-``isa<>``'s automatically.

Note that this is the reason that we did not need to introduce a; ``classof`` into ``Shape``: all relevant classes derive from ``Shape``,; and ``Shape`` itself is abstract (has no entry in the ``Kind`` enum),; so this notional inferred ``classof`` is all we need.

A mask defines which elements to collect from the vector. ::. declare void @llvm.masked.compressstore.v8i32 (<8 x i32> <value>, ptr <ptr>, <8 x i1> <mask>); declare void @llvm.masked.compressstore.v16f32 (<16 x float> <value>, ptr <ptr>, <16 x i1> <mask>). Overview:; """""""""""""""""". Selects elements from input vector '``value``' according to the '``mask``'. All selected elements are written into adjacent memory addresses starting at address '`ptr`', from lower to higher. The mask holds a bit for each vector lane, and is used to select elements to be stored. The number of elements to be stored is equal to the number of active bits in the mask. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first operand is the input vector, from which elements are collected and written to memory. The second operand is the base pointer for the store, it has the same underlying type as the element of the input vector operand. The third operand is the mask, a vector of boolean values.

If the matrix is flagged as being singular, operations with the; decomposition will fail and will return matrices or vectors that are; invalid. If one would like to monitor the tolerance parameter but not; have the code stop in case of a number smaller than `fTol`, one could; proceed as follows:. ``` {.cpp}; TVectorD b = ..;; TMatrixD a = ..;; .; TDecompLU lu(a);; Bool_t ok;; TVectorD x = lu.Solve(b,ok);; Int_t nr = 0;; while (!ok) {; lu.SetMatrix(a);; lu.SetTol(0.1*lu.GetTol());; if (nr++ > 10) break;; x = lu.Solve(b,ok);; }; if (x.IsValid()); cout << ""solved with tol ="" << lu.GetTol() << endl;; else; cout << ""solving failed "" << endl;; ```. The observant reader will notice that by scaling the complete matrix by; some small number the decomposition will detect a singular matrix. In; this case, the user will have to reduce the tolerance number by this; factor. (For CPU time saving we decided not to make this an automatic procedure). ### Condition number. The numerical accuracy of the solution `x` in `Ax = b` can be accurately; estimated by calculating the condition number `k` of matrix $A$, which is defined as:. $k = ||A||_{1}||A^{-1}||_{1}$ where $||A||_{1} = \underset{j}{max}(\sum_{i}|A_{ij}|)$. A good rule of thumb is that if the matrix condition number is 10n,; the accuracy in `x` is `15` - `n` digits for double precision. Hager devised an iterative method (W.W. Hager, Condition estimators,; SIAM J. Sci. Stat. Comp., 5 (1984), pp. 311-316) to; determine $||A^{-1}||_{1}$ without actually having to; calculate $A^{-1}$. It is used when calling `Condition()`. A code example below shows the usage of the condition number. The matrix $A$; is a (10x10) *Hilbert* matrix that is badly; conditioned as its determinant shows.

(See the next section; for details concerning this transformation.) Because this; transformation is non-linear, it is recommended to avoid putting; limits on parameters where they are not needed. As an example, suppose that the user has defined the following; parameters:. - Parameter 0, constant. - Parameter 1, freely variable. - Parameter 2, variable with limits. - Parameter 3, constant. - Parameter 4, freely variable. Then the internal parameter list would be as follows:. - Internal parameter 0 = external parameter 1. - Internal parameter 1 = external parameter 2, transformed; appropriately. - Internal parameter 2 = external parameter 4. In the above example, M considers that the number of external parameters; is 5, and the number of internal parameters is 3. This is the number; which determines, for example, the size of the error matrix of the; parameters, since only variable parameters have errors. An important feature of M is that parameters are allowed to change types; during the M minimization and analysis of a $\mbox{FCN}$ function.; Several applications in M have methods available to make variable; parameters fixed and vice-versa; to impose, change, or remove limits; from variable parameters; and even to define completely new parameters; at any time during a run. In addition, some M applications (notably the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ error analysis) cause one or more variable parameters; to be temporarily fixed during the calculation. Therefore, the; correspondence between external and internal parameter lists is in; general a dynamic one, and the number of internal parameters is not; necessarily constant.

Again, the CommandLine library does not require the options to be specified in; any particular order, so the above declaration is equivalent to:. .. code-block:: c++. cl::opt<string> InputFilename(cl::Positional, cl::Required, cl::desc(""<input file>""));. By simply adding the `cl::Required`_ flag, the CommandLine library will; automatically issue an error if the argument is not specified, which shifts all; of the command line option verification code out of your application into the; library.

While an addition happens to the loaded (potentially secret) value, that; doesn't leak any data and we then immediately harden it. ###### Hardening of loaded values deferred down the data-invariant expression graph. We can generalize the previous idea and sink the hardening down the expression; graph across as many data-invariant operations as desirable. This can use very; conservative rules for whether something is data-invariant. The primary goal; should be to handle multiple loads with a single hardening instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate without leaking.; addl 4(%rsi), %edi # Continue without leaking.; addl 8(%rsi), %edi; orl %eax, %edi # Mask out bits from all three loads.; ```. ###### Preserving the flags while hardening loaded values on Haswell, Zen, and newer processors. Sadly, there are no useful instructions on x86 that apply a mask to all 64 bits; without touching the flag registers. However, we can harden loaded values that; are narrower than a word (fewer than 32-bits on 32-bit systems and fewer than; 64-bits on 64-bit systems) by zero-extending the value to the full word size; and then shifting right by at least the number of original bits using the BMI2; `shrx` instruction:; ```; ... .LBB0_4: # %danger; cmovneq %r8, %rax # Conditionally update predicate state.; addl (%rsi), %edi # Load and accumulate 32 bits of data.; shrxq %rax, %rdi, %rdi # Shift out all 32 bits loaded.; ```. Because on x86 the zero-extend is free, this can efficiently harden the loaded; value. ##### Hardening the address of the load. When hardening the loaded value is inapplicable, most often because the; instruction directly leaks information (like `cmp` or `jmpq`), we switch to; hardening the _address_ of the load instead of the loaded value. This avoids; increasing register pressure by unfolding the load or paying some other high",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md:26838,mask,mask,26838,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.md,1,['mask'],['mask']

The; disadvantage of this was that there was limited room for expansion, and; virtually no support for attribute-value pairs other than alignment. In the new scheme, an ``Attribute`` object represents a single attribute that's; uniqued. You use the ``Attribute::get`` methods to create a new ``Attribute``; object. An attribute can be a single ""enum"" value (the enum being the; ``Attribute::AttrKind`` enum), a string representing a target-dependent; attribute, or an attribute-value pair. Some examples:. * Target-independent: ``noinline``, ``zext``; * Target-dependent: ``""no-sse""``, ``""thumb2""``; * Attribute-value pair: ``""cpu"" = ""cortex-a8""``, ``align = 4``. Note: for an attribute value pair, we expect a target-dependent attribute to; have a string for the value. ``Attribute``; =============; An ``Attribute`` object is designed to be passed around by value. Because attributes are no longer represented as a bit mask, you will need to; convert any code which does treat them as a bit mask to use the new query; methods on the Attribute class. ``AttributeList``; =================. The ``AttributeList`` stores a collection of Attribute objects for each kind of; object that may have an attribute associated with it: the function as a whole,; the return type, or the function's parameters. A function's attributes are at; index ``AttributeList::FunctionIndex``; the return type's attributes are at; index ``AttributeList::ReturnIndex``; and the function's parameters' attributes; are at indices 1, ..., n (where 'n' is the number of parameters). Most methods; on the ``AttributeList`` class take an index parameter. An ``AttributeList`` is also a uniqued and immutable object. You create an; ``AttributeList`` through the ``AttributeList::get`` methods. You can add and; remove attributes, which result in the creation of a new ``AttributeList``.

After the conditional branch is inserted, we move the builder to start; inserting into the ""then"" block. Strictly speaking, this call moves the; insertion point to be at the end of the specified block. However, since; the ""then"" block is empty, it also starts out by inserting at the; beginning of the block. :). Once the insertion point is set, we recursively codegen the ""then""; expression from the AST. To finish off the ""then"" block, we create an; unconditional branch to the merge block. One interesting (and very; important) aspect of the LLVM IR is that it :ref:`requires all basic; blocks to be ""terminated"" <functionstructure>` with a :ref:`control; flow instruction <terminators>` such as return or branch.

The final line here is quite subtle, but is very important.

Specifying Diagnostics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Indicating that a line expects an error or a warning is easy. Put a comment; on the line that has the diagnostic, use; ``expected-{error,warning,remark,note}`` to tag if it's an expected error,; warning, remark, or note (respectively), and place the expected text between; ``{{`` and ``}}`` markers. The full text doesn't have to be included, only; enough to ensure that the correct diagnostic was emitted. (Note: full text; should be included in test cases unless there is a compelling reason to use; truncated text instead.). For a full description of the matching behavior, including more complex; matching scenarios, see :ref:`matching <DiagnosticMatching>` below. Here's an example of the most commonly used way to specify expected; diagnostics:. .. code-block:: c++. int A = B; // expected-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'B'}}. You can place as many diagnostics on one line as you wish. To make the code; more readable, you can use slash-newline to separate out the diagnostics. Alternatively, it is possible to specify the line on which the diagnostic; should appear by appending ``@<line>`` to ``expected-<type>``, for example:. .. code-block:: c++. #warning some text; // expected-warning@10 {{some text}}. The line number may be absolute (as above), or relative to the current line by; prefixing the number with either ``+`` or ``-``. If the diagnostic is generated in a separate file, for example in a shared; header file, it may be beneficial to be able to declare the file in which the; diagnostic will appear, rather than placing the ``expected-*`` directive in the; actual file itself. This can be done using the following syntax:. .. code-block:: c++. // expected-error@path/include.h:15 {{error message}}.

Availability,"unction generates code to; compute the Negative Log likelihood (NLL). We can see that the intermediate; result variable `resName` is added to the context so that it can be accessed; and used in the generated code. This variable is made available globally; (using `addToGlobalScope()`). If a weight sum is needed, then it creates a loop, and `weightSumName` is; accumulated with the weight variable. Otherwise, if there are multiple; simultaneous PDFs, then it adds a term to the result that scales with the; logarithm of the count of simultaneous PDFs. The rest of the function body; (including the loop scope with NLL computation) has omitted from this example; to keep it brief. Helper functions:. - `makeValidVarName()` helps get a valid name from the name of the respective; RooFit class. It then helps save it to the variable that represents the result; of this class (the squashed code/ C++ function that will be created). - `addToGlobalScope()` helps declare and initialize the results variable, so; that it can be available globally (throughout the function body). For local; variables, the `addToCodeBody()` function can be used to keep the variables in; the respective scope (for example, within a loop). - `beginLoop()` helps build the start and the end of a For loop for your; class. Simply place this function in the scope and place the contents of the; `For` loop below this statement. The code squashing task will automatically; build a loop around the statements that follow it. There's no need to worry; about the index of these loops, because they get propagated. For example, if; you want to iterate over a vector of RooFit objects using a loop, you don't; have to think about indexing them properly because the `beginLoop()` function; takes care of that. Simply call this function, place your function call in a; scope and after the scope ends, the loop will also end. - `addToCodeBody()` helps add things to the body of the C++ function that; you're creating.

Docker images are built from a so-called *Dockerfile*, a source file written in; a specialized language that defines instructions to be used when build; the docker image (see `official; documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/>`_ for more; details). A minimal Dockerfile typically contains a base image and a number; of RUN commands that have to be executed to build the image. When building a new; image, docker will first download your base image, mount its filesystem as; read-only and then add a writable overlay on top of it to keep track of all; filesystem modifications, performed while building your image. When the build; process is finished, a diff between your image's final filesystem state and the; base image's filesystem is stored in the resulting image. Overview; ========; The ``llvm/utils/docker`` folder contains Dockerfiles and simple bash scripts to; serve as a basis for anyone who wants to create their own Docker image with; LLVM components, compiled from sources. The sources are checked out from the; upstream git repository when building the image. The resulting image contains only the requested LLVM components and a few extra; packages to make the image minimally useful for C++ development, e.g. libstdc++; and binutils.

To implement this rule, the compiler requires a linear representation of; statements to understand the ordering and the adjacency between the two or more; assignments. The Clang CFG is used to implement this analysis as Clang CFG; provides a linear view of statements within each ``CFGBlock`` (Clang; ``CFGBlock`` represents a single basic block in a source-level CFG). Bounds check optimizations; ==========================. In ``-fbounds-safety``, the Clang frontend emits run-time checks for every; memory dereference if the type system or analyses in the frontend couldn’t; verify its bounds safety. The implementation relies on LLVM optimizations to; remove redundant run-time checks. Using this optimization strategy, if the; original source code already has bounds checks, the fewer additional checks; ``-fbounds-safety`` will introduce. The LLVM ``ConstraintElimination`` pass is; design to remove provable redundant checks (please check Florian Hahn’s; presentation in 2021 LLVM Dev Meeting and the implementation to learn more). In; the following example, ``-fbounds-safety`` implicitly adds the redundant bounds; checks that the optimizer can remove:. .. code-block:: c. void fill_array_with_indices(int *__counted_by(count) p, size_t count) {; for (size_t i = 0; i < count; ++i) {; // implicit bounds checks:; // if (p + i < p || p + i + 1 > p + count) trap();; p[i] = i;; }; }. ``ConstraintElimination`` collects the following facts and determines if the; bounds checks can be safely removed:. * Inside the for-loop, ``0 <= i < count``, hence ``1 <= i + 1 <= count``.; * Pointer arithmetic ``p + count`` in the if-condition doesn’t w",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafetyImplPlans.rst:6250,redundant,redundant,6250,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafetyImplPlans.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/BoundsSafetyImplPlans.rst,1,['redundant'],['redundant']

The ``__block`` Storage Qualifier; =================================. In addition to the new Block type we also introduce a new storage; qualifier, :block-term:`__block`, for local variables. [testme: a; __block declaration within a block literal] The ``__block`` storage; qualifier is mutually exclusive to the existing local storage; qualifiers auto, register, and static. [testme] Variables qualified by; ``__block`` act as if they were in allocated storage and this storage; is automatically recovered after last use of said variable. An; implementation may choose an optimization where the storage is; initially automatic and only ""moved"" to allocated (heap) storage upon; a Block_copy of a referencing Block. Such variables may be mutated as; normal variables are. In the case where a ``__block`` variable is a Block one must assume; that the ``__block`` variable resides in allocated storage and as such; is assumed to reference a Block that is also in allocated storage; (that it is the result of a ``Block_copy`` operation). Despite this; there is no provision to do a ``Block_copy`` or a ``Block_release`` if; an implementation provides initial automatic storage for Blocks.

Nevertheless, with the above caveats, if your system C/C++ run-times are new; enough, the following can be made to work::. $ conda create -n WORK; $ conda activate WORK; (WORK) $ conda install python; (WORK) $ conda install -c conda-forge compilers; (WORK) [current compiler] $ python -m pip install cppyy. C++ standard with pip; ---------------------. The C++20 standard is the default on all systems as of release 3.0.1 (both; PyPI and conda-forge); it is C++17 for older releases.; When installing from PyPI using ``pip``, you can control the standard; selection by setting the ``STDCXX`` envar to '20', '17', or '14' (for Linux,; the backend does not need to be recompiled) for the 3.x releases; '17', '14',; or '11' for the 2.x releases.; Note that the build will automatically lower your choice if the compiler used; does not support a newer standard. Install from source; -------------------; .. _installation_from_source:. To build an existing release from source, tell ``pip`` to not download any; binary wheels.; Build-time only dependencies are ``cmake`` (for general build), ``python``; (obviously, but also for LLVM), and a modern C++ compiler (one that supports; at least C++14).; Use the envar ``STDCXX`` to control the C++ standard version; ``MAKE`` to; change the ``make`` command, ``MAKE_NPROCS`` to control the maximum number of; parallel jobs allowed, and ``VERBOSE=1`` to see full build/compile commands.; Example (using ``--verbose`` to see ``pip`` progress)::. $ STDCXX=17 MAKE_NPROCS=32 pip install --verbose cppyy --no-binary=cppyy-cling. Compilation of the backend, which contains a customized version of; Clang/LLVM, can take a long time, so by default the setup script will use all; cores (x2 if hyperthreading is enabled).; Once built, however, the wheel of ``cppyy-cling`` is reused by pip for all; versions of CPython and for PyPy, thus the long compilation is needed only; once for all different versions of Python on the same machine.

These settings are not optimal for most; desktop systems, and we hope that packagers (e.g., Redhat, Debian, MacPorts,; etc.) will tweak them. This document lists settings we suggest you tweak. LLVM's API changes with each release, so users are likely to want, for example,; both LLVM-2.6 and LLVM-2.7 installed at the same time to support apps developed; against each. Compile Flags; =============. LLVM runs much more quickly when it's optimized and assertions are removed.; However, such a build is currently incompatible with users who build without; defining ``NDEBUG``, and the lack of assertions makes it hard to debug problems; in user code. We recommend allowing users to install both optimized and debug; versions of LLVM in parallel. The following configure flags are relevant:. ``--disable-assertions``; Builds LLVM with ``NDEBUG`` defined. Changes the LLVM ABI. Also available; by setting ``DISABLE_ASSERTIONS=0|1`` in ``make``'s environment. This; defaults to enabled regardless of the optimization setting, but it slows; things down. ``--enable-debug-symbols``; Builds LLVM with ``-g``. Also available by setting ``DEBUG_SYMBOLS=0|1`` in; ``make``'s environment. This defaults to disabled when optimizing, so you; should turn it back on to let users debug their programs. ``--enable-optimized``; (For git checkouts) Builds LLVM with ``-O2`` and, by default, turns off; debug symbols. Also available by setting ``ENABLE_OPTIMIZED=0|1`` in; ``make``'s environment. This defaults to enabled when not in a; checkout. C++ Features; ============. RTTI; LLVM disables RTTI by default. Add ``REQUIRES_RTTI=1`` to your environment; while running ``make`` to re-enable it. This will allow users to build with; RTTI enabled and still inherit from LLVM classes.

An instruction in the timeline view is identified by a pair of indices, where; the first index identifies an iteration, and the second index is the; instruction index (i.e., where it appears in the code sequence). Since this; example was generated using 3 iterations: ``-iterations=3``, the iteration; indices range from 0-2 inclusively. Excluding the first and last column, the remaining columns are in cycles.; Cycles are numbered sequentially starting from 0. From the example output above, we know the following:. * Instruction [1,0] was dispatched at cycle 1.; * Instruction [1,0] started executing at cycle 2.; * Instruction [1,0] reached the write back stage at cycle 4.; * Instruction [1,0] was retired at cycle 10. Instruction [1,0] (i.e., vmulps from iteration #1) does not have to wait in the; scheduler's queue for the operands to become available. By the time vmulps is; dispatched, operands are already available, and pipeline JFPU1 is ready to; serve another instruction. So the instruction can be immediately issued on the; JFPU1 pipeline. That is demonstrated by the fact that the instruction only; spent 1cy in the scheduler's queue. There is a gap of 5 cycles between the write-back stage and the retire event.; That is because instructions must retire in program order, so [1,0] has to wait; for [0,2] to be retired first (i.e., it has to wait until cycle 10). In the example, all instructions are in a RAW (Read After Write) dependency; chain.

Availability,"used when representing different (but related) syntaxes for nodes; with the same or similar semantics. .. _Type:. The ``Type`` class and its subclasses; -------------------------------------. The ``Type`` class (and its subclasses) are an important part of the AST.; Types are accessed through the ``ASTContext`` class, which implicitly creates; and uniques them as they are needed. Types have a couple of non-obvious; features: 1) they do not capture type qualifiers like ``const`` or ``volatile``; (see :ref:`QualType <QualType>`), and 2) they implicitly capture typedef; information. Once created, types are immutable (unlike decls). Typedefs in C make semantic analysis a bit more complex than it would be without; them. The issue is that we want to capture typedef information and represent it; in the AST perfectly, but the semantics of operations need to ""see through""; typedefs. For example, consider this code:. .. code-block:: c++. void func() {; typedef int foo;; foo X, *Y;; typedef foo *bar;; bar Z;; *X; // error; **Y; // error; **Z; // error; }. The code above is illegal, and thus we expect there to be diagnostics emitted; on the annotated lines. In this example, we expect to get:. .. code-block:: text. test.c:6:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); *X; // error; ^~; test.c:7:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); **Y; // error; ^~~; test.c:8:1: error: indirection requires pointer operand ('foo' invalid); **Z; // error; ^~~. While this example is somewhat silly, it illustrates the point: we want to; retain typedef information where possible, so that we can emit errors about; ""``std::string``"" instead of ""``std::basic_string<char, std:...``"". Doing this; requires properly keeping typedef information (for example, the type of ``X``; is ""``foo``"", not ""``int``""), and requires properly propagating it through the; various operators (for example, the type of ``*Y`` is ""``foo``"", not; ""``int``"").

Each group has several members which may; model physically equivalent transformations but with different internal representations.; Transformation classes can operate on all type of vectors using the `operator()`; or the `operator *` and the transformations can also be combined via the `operator *`.; In more detail the transformations available are:. ### 3D Rotations. * ROOT::Math::Rotation3D, rotation described by a 3x3 matrix of doubles; * ROOT::Math::EulerAngles rotation described by the three Euler angles (phi, theta and psi) following the GoldStein [definition](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulerAngles.html).; * ROOT::Math::RotationZYX rotation described by three angles defining a rotation first along the Z axis, then along the rotated Y' axis and then along the rotated X'' axis.; * ROOT::Math::AxisAngle, rotation described",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/genvector/doc/index.md:7566,error,errors,7566,math/genvector/doc/index.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/math/genvector/doc/index.md,1,['error'],['errors']

The interface; provided by the Support Library must be implemented on all platforms (even; those without ``stat``). No Exposed Data; ---------------. Any data defined by system libraries (i.e. not defined by ``lib/Support``) must; not be exposed through the ``lib/Support`` interface, even if the header file; for that function is not exposed. As with functions, this prevents inadvertent; use of data that might not exist on all platforms. Minimize Soft Errors; --------------------. Operating system interfaces will generally provide error results for every; little thing that could go wrong. In almost all cases, you can divide these; error results into two groups: normal/good/soft and abnormal/bad/hard. That is,; some of the errors are simply information like ""file not found"", ""insufficient; privileges"", etc. while other errors are much harder like ""out of space"", ""bad; disk sector"", or ""system call interrupted"". We'll call the first group ""*soft*""; errors and the second group ""*hard*"" errors. ``lib/Support`` must always attempt to minimize soft errors. This is a design; requirement because the minimization of soft errors can affect the granularity; and the nature of the interface. In general, if you find that you're wanting to; throw soft errors, you must review the granularity of the interface because it; is likely you're trying to implement something that is too low level. The rule; of thumb is to provide interface functions that **can't** fail, except when; faced with hard errors. For a trivial example, suppose we wanted to add an ""``OpenFileForWriting``""; function. For many operating systems, if the file doesn't exist, attempting to; open the file will produce an error. However, ``lib/Support`` should not simply; throw that error if it occurs because its a soft error. The problem is that the; interface function, ``OpenFileForWriting`` i",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst:7597,error,errors,7597,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/SupportLibrary.rst,1,['error'],['errors']

Private Module Map Files; ------------------------; Module map files are typically named ``module.modulemap`` and live; either alongside the headers they describe or in a parent directory of; the headers they describe. These module maps typically describe all of; the API for the library. However, in some cases, the presence or absence of particular headers; is used to distinguish between the ""public"" and ""private"" APIs of a; particular library. For example, a library may contain the headers; ``Foo.h`` and ``Foo_Private.h``, providing public and private APIs,; respectively. Additionally, ``Foo_Private.h`` may only be available on; some versions of library, and absent in others. One cannot easily; express this with a single module map file in the library:. .. parsed-literal::. module Foo {; header ""Foo.h""; ...; }. module Foo_Private {; header ""Foo_Private.h""; ...; }. because the header ``Foo_Private.h`` won't always be available. The; module map file could be customized based on whether; ``Foo_Private.h`` is available or not, but doing so requires custom; build machinery. Private module map files, which are named ``module.private.modulemap``; (or, for backward compatibility, ``module_private.map``), allow one to; augment the primary module map file with an additional modules. For; example, we would split the module map file above into two module map; files:. .. code-block:: c. /* module.modulemap */; module Foo {; header ""Foo.h""; }. /* module.private.modulemap */; module Foo_Private {; header ""Foo_Private.h""; }. When a ``module.private.modulemap`` file is found alongside a; ``module.modulemap`` file, it is loaded after the ``module.modulemap``; file. In our example library, the ``module.private.modulemap`` file; would be available when ``Foo_Private.h`` is available, making it; easier to split a library's public and private APIs along header; boundaries.

On the x86 platform we break down the implementation into three core; components: accumulating the predicate state through the control flow graph,; checking the loads, and checking control transfers between procedures. #### Accumulating Predicate State. Consider baseline x86 instructions like the following, which test three; conditions and if all pass, loads data from memory and potentially leaks it; through some side channel:; ```; # %bb.0: # %entry; pushq %rax; testl %edi, %edi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.1: # %then1; testl %esi, %esi; jne .LBB0_4; # %bb.2: # %then2; testl %edx, %edx; je .LBB0_3; .LBB0_4: # %exit; popq %rax; retq; .LBB0_3: # %danger; movl (%rcx), %edi; callq leak; popq %rax; retq; ```. When we go to speculatively execute the load, we want to know whether any of; the dynamically executed predicates have been misspeculated. To track that,; along each conditional edge, we need to track the data which would allow that; edge to be taken. On x86, this data is stored in the flags register used by the; conditional jump instruction.

A better implementation would be to relax the LLVM IR rules for sret; arguments to allow a function with an sret argument to have a non-void; return type, and to have the front-end to set up the sret argument value; as the return value of the function.

Unfortunately, the technique of using `orq`-instructions has a serious flaw on; x86. The very thing that makes it easy to accumulate state, the flag registers; containing predicates, causes serious problems here because they may be alive; and used by the loading instruction or subsequent instructions. On x86, the; `orq` instruction **sets** the flags and will override anything already there.; This makes inserting them into the instruction stream very hazardous.; Unfortunately, unlike when hardening the loaded value, we have no fallback here; and so we must have a fully general approach available. The first thing we must do when generating these sequences is try to analyze; the surrounding code to prove that the flags are not in fact alive or being; used. Typically, it has been set by some other instruction which just happens; to set the flags register (much like ours!) with no actual dependency. In those; cases, it is safe to directly insert these instructions. Alternatively we may; be able to move them earlier to avoid clobbering the used value. However, this may ultimately be impossible.

Availability,"verifier uses types; to detect straightforward type confusion bugs. However, frontends also have to; deal with the complexity of inserting bitcasts everywhere that they might be; required. The community consensus is that the costs of pointee types; outweight the benefits, and that they should be removed. Many operations do not actually care about the underlying type. These; operations, typically intrinsics, usually end up taking an arbitrary pointer; type ``i8*`` and sometimes a size. This causes lots of redundant no-op bitcasts; in the IR to and from a pointer with a different pointee type. No-op bitcasts take up memory/disk space and also take up compile time to look; through. However, perhaps the biggest issue is the code complexity required to; deal with bitcasts. When looking up through def-use chains for pointers it's; easy to forget to call `Value::stripPointerCasts()` to find the true underlying; pointer obfuscated by bitcasts. And when looking down through def-use chains; passes need to iterate through bitcasts to handle uses. Removing no-op pointer; bitcasts prevents a category of missed optimizations and makes writing LLVM; passes a little bit easier. Fewer no-op pointer bitcasts also reduces the chances of incorrect bitcasts in; regards to address spaces. People maintaining backends that care a lot about; address spaces have complained that frontends like Clang often incorrectly; bitcast pointers, losing address space information. An analogous transition that happened earlier in LLVM is integer signedness.; Currently there is no distinction between signed and unsigned integer types, but; rather each integer operation (e.g. add) contains flags to signal how to treat; the integer. Previously LLVM IR distinguished between unsigned and signed; integer types and ran into similar issues of no-op casts.

Let us look at a simple example of a toy experiment comparing two; methods to fit a function to a histogram, the $\chi^{2}$. method and a method called ""binned log-likelihood fit"", both available in ROOT. As a very simple yet powerful quantity to check the quality of the fit; results, we construct for each pseudo-data set the so-called ""pull"", the; difference of the estimated and the true value of a parameter,; normalised to the estimated error on the parameter,; $\frac{(p_{estim} - p_{true})}{\sigma_{p}}$. If everything is OK, the; distribution of the pull values is a standard normal distribution, i.e.; a Gaussian distribution centred around zero with a standard deviation of one. The macro performs a rather big number of toy experiments, where a; histogram is repeatedly filled with Gaussian distributed numbers,; representing the pseudo-data in this example. Each time, a fit is; performed according to the selected method, and the pull is calculated; and filled into a histogram. Here is the code:. ``` {.cpp .numberLines}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/macro9.C; ```. Your present knowledge of ROOT should be enough to understand all the; technicalities behind the macro.

Add the required bots to implement the commit emails, as well as the; umbrella repository update (if the multirepo is selected) or the read-only; Git views for the sub-projects (if the monorepo is selected). Step #2 : Git Move; ------------------. 4. Update the buildbots to pick up updates and commits from the GitHub; repository. Not all bots have to migrate at this point, but it'll help; provide infrastructure testing.; 5. Update Phabricator to pick up commits from the GitHub repository.; 6. LNT and llvmlab have to be updated: they rely on unique monotonically; increasing integer across branch [MatthewsRevNum]_.; 7. Instruct downstream integrators to pick up commits from the GitHub; repository.; 8. Review and prepare an update for the LLVM documentation. Until this point nothing has changed for developers, it will just; boil down to a lot of work for buildbot and other infrastructure; owners. The migration will pause here until all dependencies have cleared, and all; problems have been solved. Step #3: Write Access Move; --------------------------. 9. Collect developers' GitHub account information, and add them to the project.; 10. Switch the SVN repository to read-only and allow pushes to the GitHub repository.; 11. Update the documentation.; 12.

Overview:; """""""""""""""""". Selects elements from input vector '``value``' according to the '``mask``'. All selected elements are written into adjacent memory addresses starting at address '`ptr`', from lower to higher. The mask holds a bit for each vector lane, and is used to select elements to be stored. The number of elements to be stored is equal to the number of active bits in the mask. Arguments:; """""""""""""""""""". The first operand is the input vector, from which elements are collected and written to memory.

It allows to collect elements from possibly non-adjacent lanes of a vector and store them contiguously in memory in one IR operation. It is useful for targets that support compressing store operations and allows vectorizing loops with cross-iteration dependences like in the following example:. .. code-block:: c. // In this loop we load elements from A and store them consecutively in B; double *A, B; int *C;; for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {; if (C[i] != 0); B[j++] = A[i]; }. .. code-block:: llvm. ; Load elements from A.; %Tmp = call <8 x double> @llvm.masked.load.v8f64.p0(ptr %Aptr, i32 8, <8 x i1> %Mask, <8 x double> poison); ; Store all selected elements consecutively in array B; call <void> @llvm.masked.compressstore.v8f64(<8 x double> %Tmp, ptr %Bptr, <8 x i1> %Mask). ; %Bptr should be increased on each iteration according to the number of '1' elements in the Mask.; %MaskI = bitcast <8 x i1> %Mask to i8; %Mas",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst:859543,mask,masked,859543,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/LangRef.rst,1,['mask'],['masked']

If ``callee`` changed its signature to ``uint16x4_t``, which is equivalent in register content, if we passed as ``LD1`` we'd break this code until ``caller`` was updated and recompiled. There is an argument that if the signatures of the two functions are different then the behaviour should be undefined. But there may be functions that are agnostic to the lane layout of the vector, and treating the vector as an opaque value (just loading it and storing it) would be impossible without a common format across ABI boundaries. So to preserve ABI compatibility, we need to use the ``LDR`` lane layout across function calls. Alignment; ---------. In strict alignment mode, ``LDR qX`` requires its address to be 128-bit aligned, whereas ``LD1`` only requires it to be as aligned as the lane size. If we canonicalised on using ``LDR``, we'd still need to use ``LD1`` in some places to avoid alignment faults (the result of the ``LD1`` would then need to be reversed with ``REV``). Most operating systems however do not run with alignment faults enabled, so this is often not an issue. Summary; -------.

In addition all; constants set in MnStrategy can be changed individually by the user,; e.g. the number of iteration cycles in the numerical gradient. ## Parameter errors ##. M is usually used to find the ""best"" values of a set of parameters,; where ""best"" is defined as those values which minimize a given function,; $\mbox{FCN}$. The width of the function minimum, or more generally,; the shape of the function in some neighbourhood of the minimum, gives; information about the *uncertainty* in the best parameter values, often; called by physicists the *parameter errors*. An important feature of M; is that it offers several tools to analyze the parameter errors. ### $\mbox{FCN}$ normalization and the error definition ###. Whatever method is used to calculate the parameter errors, they will; depend on the overall (multiplicative) normalization of; $\mbox{FCN}$, in the sense that if the value of $\mbox{FCN}$ is; everywhere multiplied by a constant $\beta$, then the errors will be; decreased by a factor $\sqrt{\beta}$. Additive constants do not change; the parameter errors, but may imply a different goodness-of-fit; confidence level. Assuming that the user knows what the normalization of their; $\mbox{FCN}$ means, and also that they are interested in parameter; errors, the user can change the error definition which allows them to; define what they means by one ""error"", in terms of the change in the; $\mbox{FCN}$ value which should be caused by changing one parameter; by one ""error"". If the $\mbox{FCN}$ is the usual chisquare function; (defined below) and if the user wants the usual one-standard-deviation; errors, then the error definition (return value of the FCNBase::up(); method, see [howto:errordef]) should be $1.0$. If the $\mbox{FCN}$; is a negative-log-likelihood function, then the one-standard-deviation; value for FCNBase::up() to return is $0.5",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:13078,error,errors,13078,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,2,['error'],['errors']
Availability,"which is being miscompiled. The miscompilation debugger assumes that; the selected code generator is working properly. Advice for using bugpoint; =========================. ``bugpoint`` can be a remarkably useful tool, but it sometimes works in; non-obvious ways. Here are some hints and tips:. * In the code generator and miscompilation debuggers, ``bugpoint`` only works; with programs that have deterministic output. Thus, if the program outputs; ``argv[0]``, the date, time, or any other ""random"" data, ``bugpoint`` may; misinterpret differences in these data, when output, as the result of a; miscompilation. Programs should be temporarily modified to disable outputs; that are likely to vary from run to run. * In the `crash debugger`_, ``bugpoint`` does not distinguish different crashes; during reduction. Thus, if new crash or miscompilation happens, ``bugpoint``; will continue with the new crash instead. If you would like to stick to; particular crash, you should write check scripts to validate the error; message, see ``-compile-command`` in :doc:`CommandGuide/bugpoint`. * In the code generator and miscompilation debuggers, debugging will go faster; if you manually modify the program or its inputs to reduce the runtime, but; still exhibit the problem. * ``bugpoint`` is extremely useful when working on a new optimization: it helps; track down regressions quickly. To avoid having to relink ``bugpoint`` every; time you change your optimization however, have ``bugpoint`` dynamically load; your optimization with the ``-load`` option. * ``bugpoint`` can generate a lot of output and run for a long period of time.; It is often useful to capture the output of the program to file. For example,; in the C shell, you can run:. .. code-block:: console. $ bugpoint ... |& tee bugpoint.log. to get a copy of ``bugpoint``'s output in the file ``bugpoint.log``, as well; as on your terminal. * ``bugpoint`` cannot debug problems with the LLVM linker.

For example:. .. code-block:: c++. // RUN: %clang_cc1 -verify=foo,bar %s. int A = B; // foo-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'B'}}; int C = D; // bar-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'D'}}; int E = F; // expected-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'F'}}. The verifier will recognize ``foo-error`` and ``bar-error`` as special comments; but will not recognize ``expected-error`` as one because the ``-verify`` line; does not contain that as a prefix. Thus, this test would fail verification; because an unexpected diagnostic would appear on the declaration of ``E``. Multiple occurrences accumulate prefixes. For example,; ``-verify -verify=foo,bar -verify=baz`` is equivalent to; ``-verify=expected,foo,bar,baz``. Specifying Diagnostics; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^; Indicating that a line expects an error or a warning is easy. Put a comment; on the line that has the diagnostic, use; ``expected-{error,warning,remark,note}`` to tag if it's an expected error,; warning, remark, or note (respectively), and place the expected text between; ``{{`` and ``}}`` markers. The full text doesn't have to be included, only; enough to ensure that the correct diagnostic was emitted. (Note: full text; should be included in test cases unless there is a compelling reason to use; truncated text instead.). For a full description of the matching behavior, including more complex; matching scenarios, see :ref:`matching <DiagnosticMatching>` below. Here's an example of the most commonly used way to specify expected; diagnostics:. .. code-block:: c++. int A = B; // expected-error {{use of undeclared identifier 'B'}}. You can place as many diagnostics on one line as you wish. To make the code; more readable, you can use slash-newline to separate out the diagnostics. Alternatively, it is possible to specify the line on which the diagnostic; should appear by appending ``@<line>`` to ``expected-<type>``, for example:. .. code-block:: c++. #warning some te",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst:157013,error,error,157013,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/InternalsManual.rst,2,['error'],['error']

Relationship to other ROOT components; -------------------------------------. The RNTuple classes have the following relationship to other parts of ROOT. The RNTuple classes use core ROOT infrastructure classes, such as error handling and logging.; When necessary, RNTuple uses a `TFile` for reading and writing.; The cases of writing to a local file and reading from a local file, a file from XRootD or from HTTP, do _not_ require `TFile`.; For these cases, RNTuple depends on the `RRawFile` class and its XRootD and Davix plugins. For user-defined classes as well as sets and maps, RNTuple uses `TClass`.; Simple types and other stdlib classes are natively supported and do not require dictionaries.; See the format specification for an exhaustive list of types supported in RNTuple.; The streamer field uses the standard ROOT streaming machinery. Integration to RDataFrame is provided through an RNTuple data source.; A universal RDataFrame constructor can create a data frame from either a TTree or an RNTuple with the same syntax. The RBrowser uses RNTuple classes to display RNTuple dataset information. Future Features; ---------------.

Because of the layout manipulation, the; globals' definitions must be available at LTO time. For more information,; see the `control flow integrity design document`_. A type identifier that identifies functions is transformed into a jump table,; which is a block of code consisting of one branch instruction for each; of the functions associated with the type identifier that branches to the; target function. The pass will redirect any taken function addresses to the; corresponding jump table entry. In the object file's symbol table, the jump; table entries take the identities of the original functions, so that addresses; taken outside the module will pass any verification done inside the module. Jump tables may call external functions, so their definitions need not; be available at LTO time. Note that if an externally defined function is; associated with a type identifier, there is no guarantee that its identity; within the module will be the same as its identity outside of the module,; as the former will be the jump table entry if a jump table is necessary.

This is done most easily by; creating a new `TStyle` object with your preferred settings, as; described in the class reference guide, and then use the command; `gROOT->SetStyle(""MyStyleName"");` to make this new style definition the; default one. As an example, have a look in the file `rootlogon.C` coming; with this tutorial. Another relevant file is `rootlogoff.C` that it; called when the session is finished. ### ROOT command history ###. Every command typed at the ROOT prompt is stored in a file `.root_hist`; in your home directory. ROOT uses this file to allow for navigation in; the command history with the up-arrow and down-arrow keys. It is also; convenient to extract successful ROOT commands with the help of a text; editor for use in your own macros. ### ROOT Global Pointers ###. All global pointers in ROOT begin with a small ""g"". Some of them were; already implicitly introduced (for example in the section; [Configure ROOT at start-up](#configure-root-at-start-up)).; The most important among them are presented in the following:. - **[gROOT](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTROOT.html)**: the `gROOT`; variable is the entry point to the ROOT system. Technically it is an; instance of the `TROOT` class. Using the `gROOT` pointer one has; access to basically every object created in a ROOT based program.; The `TROOT` object is essentially a container of several lists; pointing to the main `ROOT` objects. - **[gStyle](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTStyle.html)**: By default; ROOT creates a default style that can be accessed via the `gStyle`; pointer.

The current state; can be serialized using ``-stop-before`` or ``-stop-after`` and loaded using; ``-start-before``, ``-start-after``, and ``-run-pass``.

This can be used; to track down correctness bugs and can also be used to track down performance; regressions. It can also be coupled with function attributes to disable; GlobalISel for one or more of the extracted functions. .. image:: block-extract.png. The command to do the extraction is:. .. code-block:: shell. ./bin/llvm-extract -o - -S -b ‘foo:bb1;bb4’ <input> > extracted.ll. This particular example extracts two basic blocks from a function named ``foo``.; The new LLVM-IR can then be modified to add the ``failedISel`` attribute to the; extracted function containing bb4 to make that function use SelectionDAG.

For more information about the ordering of; lookup in templates, see [temp.dep.candidate]. Unqualified lookup into dependent bases of class templates.

Like we said above, unqualified names like; DoThis and DoThat are looked up when the template; Derived is defined, not when it's instantiated. When we look; up a name used in a class, we usually look into the base classes.; However, we can't look into the base class Base<T>; because its type depends on the template argument T, so the; standard says we should just ignore it.

Availability,"xpected to fail when targeting PowerPC or running on Darwin.; ; XFAIL: target=powerpc{{.*}}, system-darwin. Tips for writing constraints; ----------------------------. **``REQUIRES`` and ``UNSUPPORTED``**. These are logical inverses. In principle, ``UNSUPPORTED`` isn't absolutely; necessary (the logical negation could be used with ``REQUIRES`` to get; exactly the same effect), but it can make these clauses easier to read and; understand. Generally, people use ``REQUIRES`` to state things that the test; depends on to operate correctly, and ``UNSUPPORTED`` to exclude cases where; the test is expected never to work. **``UNSUPPORTED`` and ``XFAIL``**. Both of these indicate that the test isn't expected to work; however, they; have different effects. ``UNSUPPORTED`` causes the test to be skipped;; this saves execution time, but then you'll never know whether the test; actually would start working. Conversely, ``XFAIL`` actually runs the test; but expects a failure output, taking extra execution time but alerting you; if/when the test begins to behave correctly (an XPASS test result). You; need to decide which is more appropriate in each case. **Using ``target=...``**. Checking the target triple can be tricky; it's easy to mis-specify. For; example, ``target=mips{{.*}}`` will match not only mips, but also mipsel,; mips64, and mips64el. ``target={{.*}}-linux-gnu`` will match; x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, but not armv8l-unknown-linux-gnueabihf.; Prefer to use hyphens to delimit triple components (``target=mips-{{.*}}``); and it's generally a good idea to use a trailing wildcard to allow for; unexpected suffixes. Also, it's generally better to write regular expressions that use entire; triple components, than to do something clever to shorten them. For; example, to match both freebsd and netbsd in an expression, you could write; ``target={{.*(free|net)bsd.*}}`` and that would work.

We strongly encourage looking at ``clang/cmake/caches/MultiDistributionExample.cmake``; as an example of configuring multiple distributions. Special Notes for Library-only Distributions; --------------------------------------------. One of the most powerful features of LLVM is its library-first design mentality; and the way you can compose a wide variety of tools using different portions of; LLVM. Even in this situation using *BUILD_SHARED_LIBS* is not supported. If you; want to distribute LLVM as a shared library for use in a tool, the recommended; method is using *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB*, and you can use *LLVM_DYLIB_COMPONENTS*; to configure which LLVM components are part of libLLVM.; Note: *LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB* is not available on Windows. Options for Optimizing LLVM; ===========================. There are four main build optimizations that our CMake build system supports.; When performing a bootstrap build it is not beneficial to do anything other than; setting *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* to ``Release`` for the stage-1 compiler. This is; because the more intensive optimizations are expensive to perform and the; stage-1 compiler is thrown away. All of the further options described should be; set on the stage-2 compiler either using a CMake cache file, or by prefixing the; option with *BOOTSTRAP_*. The first and simplest to use is the compiler optimization level by setting the; *CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE* option. The main values of interest are ``Release`` or; ``RelWithDebInfo``. By default the ``Release`` option uses the ``-O3``; optimization level, and ``RelWithDebInfo`` uses ``-O2``. If you want to generate; debug information and use ``-O3`` you can override the; *CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_RELWITHDEBINFO* option ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst:7454,avail,available,7454,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/BuildingADistribution.rst,1,['avail'],['available']

For a stepping method (like $\mbox{SIMPLEX}$) this seldom poses any; problem, but a method based on derivatives ($\mbox{MIGRAD}$) may; become blocked at such a value. If this happens, it may be necessary to; move the value of the parameter in question a significant distance from; the limit (e.g. with MnMigrad::setValue(...)) and restart the; minimization, perhaps with that parameter fixed temporarily. ### Getting the right parameter errors with limits ###. [answer:right-errors]. In the best case, where the minimum is far from any limits, M will; correctly transform the error matrix, and the parameter errors it; reports should be accurate and very close to those you would have got; without limits. In other cases (which should be more common, since; otherwise you wouldn't need limits), the very meaning of parameter; errors becomes problematic. Mathematically, since the limit is an; absolute constraint on the parameter, a parameter at its limit has no; error, at least in one direction. The error matrix, which can assign; only symmetric errors, then becomes essentially meaningless. On the; other hand, the $\mbox{MINOS}$ analysis is still meaningful, at; least in principle, as long as $\mbox{MIGRAD}$ (which is called; internally by $\mbox{MINOS}$) does not get blocked at a limit.; Unfortunately, the user has no control over this aspect of the; $\mbox{MINOS}$ calculation, although it is possible to get enough; printout from the $\mbox{MINOS}$ result to be able to determine; whether the results are reliable or not. ## Fixing and releasing parameters ##.

Additive constants do not change; the parameter errors, but may imply a different goodness-of-fit; confidence level. Assuming that the user knows what the normalization of their; $\mbox{FCN}$ means, and also that they are interested in parameter; errors, the user can change the error definition which allows them to; define what they means by one ""error"", in terms of the change in the; $\mbox{FCN}$ value which should be caused by changing one parameter; by one ""error"". If the $\mbox{FCN}$ is the usual chisquare function; (defined below) and if the user wants the usual one-standard-deviation; errors, then the error definition (return value of the FCNBase::up(); method, see [howto:errordef]) should be $1.0$. If the $\mbox{FCN}$; is a negative-log-likelihood function, then the one-standard-deviation; value for FCNBase::up() to return is $0.5$. If the $\mbox{FCN}$ is a; chisquare, but the user wants two-standard-deviation errors, then; FCNBase::up() should return $= 4.0$, etc. Note that in the usual case where M is being used to perform a fit to; some experimental data, the parameter errors will be proportional to the; uncertainty in the data, and therefore meaningful parameter errors; cannot be obtained unless the measurement errors of the data are known.; In the common case of",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md:13574,error,errors,13574,documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/minuit2/Minuit2.md,4,['error'],"['error', 'errors']"

Updating Toolchain Requirements; -------------------------------. We intend to require newer toolchains as time goes by. This means LLVM's; codebase can use newer versions of C++ as they get standardized. Requiring newer; toolchains to build LLVM can be painful for those building LLVM; therefore, it; will only be done through the following process:. * It is a general goal to support LLVM and GCC versions from the last 3 years; at a minimum. This time-based guideline is not strict: we may support much; older compilers, or decide to support fewer versions. * An RFC is sent to the `LLVM Discourse forums`_. - Detail upsides of the version increase (e.g. which newer C++ language or; library features LLVM should use; avoid miscompiles in particular compiler; versions, etc).; - Detail downsides on important platforms (e.g. Ubuntu LTS status). * Once the RFC reaches consensus, update the CMake toolchain version checks as; well as the :doc:`getting started<GettingStarted>` guide. This provides a; softer transition path for developers compiling LLVM, because the; error can be turned into a warning using a CMake flag. This is an important; step: LLVM still doesn't have code which requires the new toolchains, but it; soon will. If you compile LLVM but don't read the forums, we should; tell you!. * Ensure that at least one LLVM release has had this soft-error. Not all; developers compile LLVM top-of-tree. These release-bound developers should; also be told about upcoming changes. * Turn the soft-error into a hard-error after said LLVM release has branched. * Update the :doc:`coding standards<CodingStandards>` to allow the new; features we've explicitly approved in the RFC. * Start using the new features in LLVM's codebase.

In the future it can be; extended to track other variable properties. E.g. we plan to extend; implementation with a check to make sure that variable is always initialized; before every read to optimize use-of-uninitialized-memory checks. How it works; ============. The analysis is implemented in two stages:. The intra-procedural, or 'local', stage performs a depth-first search inside; functions to collect all uses of each alloca, including loads/stores and uses as; arguments functions. After this stage we know which parts of the alloca are used; by functions itself but we don't know what happens after it is passed as; an argument to another function. The inter-procedural, or 'global', stage, resolves what happens to allocas after; they are passed as function arguments. This stage performs a depth-first search; on function calls inside a single module and propagates allocas usage through; functions calls. When used with ThinLTO, the global stage performs a whole program analysis over; the Module Summary Index. Testing; =======. The analysis is covered with lit tests. We expect that users can tolerate false classification of variables as; 'unsafe' when in-fact it's 'safe'. This may lead to inefficient code. However, we; can't accept false 'safe' classification which may cause sanitizers to miss actual; bugs in instrumented code. To avoid that we want additional validation tool. AddressSanitizer may help with this validation. We can instrument all variables; as usual but additionally store stack-safe information in the; ``ASanStackVariableDescription``. Then if AddressSanitizer detects a bug on; a 'safe' variable we can produce an additional report to let the user know that; probably Stack Safety Analysis failed and we should check for a bug in the; compiler.; ",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackSafetyAnalysis.rst:1644,toler,tolerate,1644,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackSafetyAnalysis.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/StackSafetyAnalysis.rst,1,['toler'],['tolerate']

To detect and help address some of these problems, the ``clang-tools-extra`` repository contains a ``modularize`` tool that parses a set of given headers and attempts to detect these problems and produce a report. See the tool's in-source documentation for information on how to check your system or library headers. Future Directions; =================; Modules support is under active development, and there are many opportunities remaining to improve it. Here are a few ideas:. **Detect unused module imports**; Unlike with ``#include`` directives, it should be fairly simple to track whether a directly-imported module has ever been used. By doing so, Clang can emit ``unused import`` or ``unused #include`` diagnostics, including Fix-Its to remove the useless imports/includes. **Fix-Its for missing imports**; It's fairly common for one to make use of some API while writing code, only to get a compiler error about ""unknown type"" or ""no function named"" because the corresponding header has not been included. Clang can detect such cases and auto-import the required module, but should provide a Fix-It to add the import. **Improve modularize**; The modularize tool is both extremely important (for deployment) and extremely crude. It needs better UI, better detection of problems (especially for C++), and perhaps an assistant mode to help write module maps for you. Where To Learn More About Modules; =================================; The Clang source code provides additional information about modules:. ``clang/lib/Headers/module.modulemap``; Module map for Clang's compiler-specific header files. ``clang/test/Modules/``; Tests specifically related to modules functionality. ``clang/include/clang/Basic/Module.h``; The ``Module`` class in this header describes a module, and is used throughout the compiler to implement modules. ``clang/include/clang/Lex/ModuleMap.h``; The ``ModuleMap``",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst:56604,error,error,56604,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/Modules.rst,1,['error'],['error']

The; first mode of operation keeps all information in your master p.d.f and may make the logistics of non-trivial; fitting problems easier. It works as follows: first you define your regular p.d.f, then you define your; constraint p.d.f and you multiply them with RooProdPdf. // Construct constraint; RooGaussian fconstraint(""fconstraint"",""fconstraint"",f,RooConst(0.8),RooConst(0.1)) ;. // Multiply constraint with p.d.f; Ro",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v520/index.html:6569,reliab,reliably,6569,roofit/doc/v520/index.html,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/roofit/doc/v520/index.html,1,['reliab'],['reliably']

This mode can be; installed/enabled by setting ``xray_mode=xray-basic`` in the ``XRAY_OPTIONS``; environment variable. Combined with ``patch_premain=true`` this can allow for; tracing applications from start to end. Like all the other modes installed through ``__xray_log_select_mode(...)``, the; implementation can be configured through the ``__xray_log_init_mode(...)``; function, providing the mode string and the flag options. Basic-mode specific; defaults can be provided in the ``XRAY_BASIC_OPTIONS`` environment variable. Flight Data Recorder Mode; -------------------------. XRay supports a logging mode which allows the application to only capture a; fixed amount of memory's worth of events. Flight Data Recorder (FDR) mode works; very much like a plane's ""black box"" which keeps recording data to memory in a; fixed-size circular queue of buffers, and have the data available; programmatically until the buffers are finalized and flushed. To use FDR mode; on your application, you may set the ``xray_mode`` variable to ``xray-fdr`` in; the ``XRAY_OPTIONS`` environment variable. Additional options to the FDR mode; implementation can be provided in the ``XRAY_FDR_OPTIONS`` environment; variable. Programmatic configuration can be done by calling; ``__xray_log_init_mode(""xray-fdr"", <configuration string>)`` once it has been; selected/installed. When the buffers are flushed to disk, the result is a binary trace format; described by `XRay FDR format <XRayFDRFormat.html>`_. When FDR mode is on, it will keep writing and recycling memory buffers until; the logging implementation is finalized -- at which point it can be flushed and; re-initialised later.

In cases where we are confident about the concrete type (e.g. the return type; for a broken non-overloaded function call), the ``RecoveryExpr`` will have this; type. This allows more code to be typechecked, and produces a better AST and; more diagnostics. For example:. .. code-block:: C++. unknownFunction().size() // .size() is a CXXDependentScopeMemberExpr; std::string(42).size() // .size() is a resolved MemberExpr. Whether or not the ``RecoveryExpr`` has a dependent type, it is always; considered value-dependent, because its value isn't well-defined until the error; is resolved. Among other things, this means that clang doesn't emit more errors; where a RecoveryExpr is used as a constant (e.g. array size), but also won't try; to evaluate it. ContainsErrors bit; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. Beyond the template dependence bits, we add a new “ContainsErrors” bit to; express “Does this expression or anything within it contain errors” semantic,; this bit is always set for RecoveryExpr, and propagated to other related nodes.; This provides a fast way to query whether any (recursive) child of an expression; had an error, which is often used to improve diagnostics. .. code-block:: C++. // C++; void recoveryExpr(int abc) {; unknownFunction(); // type-dependent, value-dependent, contains-errors. std::string(42).size(); // value-dependent, contains-errors,; // not type-dependent, as we know the type is std::string; }. .. code-block:: C. // C; void recoveryExpr(int abc) {; unknownVar + abc; // type-dependent, value-dependent, contains-errors; }.

At this point of the guide, some basic questions could have already come; to your mind.

In the official ROOT documentation, you find special data types; replacing the normal ones, e.g. `Double_t`, `Float_t` or `Int_t`; replacing the standard `double`, `float` or `int` types. Using the ROOT; types makes it easier to port code between platforms (64/32 bit) or; operating systems (windows/Linux), as these types are mapped to suitable; ones in the ROOT header files. If you want adaptive code of this type,; use the ROOT type declarations. However, usually you do not need such; adaptive code, and you can safely use the standard C type declarations; for your private code, as we did and will do throughout this guide.

Of course, in practice, you should only set ``DEBUG_TYPE`` at the top of a file,; to specify the debug type for the entire module. Be careful that you only do; this after including Debug.h and not around any #include of headers. Also, you; should use names more meaningful than ""foo"" and ""bar"", because there is no; system in place to ensure that names do not conflict. If two different modules; use the same string, they will all be turned on when the name is specified.; This allows, for example, all debug information for instruction scheduling to be; enabled with ``-debug-only=InstrSched``, even if the source lives in multiple; files. The name must not include a comma (,) as that is used to separate the; arguments of the ``-debug-only`` option. For performance reasons, -debug-only is not available in optimized build; (``--enable-optimized``) of LLVM. The ``DEBUG_WITH_TYPE`` macro is also available for situations where you would; like to set ``DEBUG_TYPE``, but only for one specific ``DEBUG`` statement. It; takes an additional first parameter, which is the type to use. For example, the; preceding example could be written as:. .. code-block:: c++.

Example of authorization configuration for FastCGI connection:. auth.require = ( ""/root.app"" => (; ""method"" => ""digest"",; ""realm"" => ""root"",; ""require"" => ""valid-user""; ) ). ## Integration with existing applications. In many practical cases no change of existing code is required. Opened files (and all objects inside), existing canvas and histograms are automatically scanned by the server and will be available to the users. If necessary, any object can be registered directly to the server with a [THttpServer::Register()](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTHttpServer.html#a73658daf379e87a4832fe9dc5c1483ed) call. Central point of integration - when and how THttpServer get access to data from a running application. By default it is done during the `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` call - THttpServer uses a synchronous timer which is activated every 100 ms. Such approach works perfectly when running macros in an interactive ROOT session. If an application runs in compiled code and does not contain `gSystem->ProcessEvents()` calls, two method are available. ### Asynchronous timer. The first method is to configure an asynchronous timer for the server, like for example:. ```cpp; serv->SetTimer(100, kFALSE);; ```. Then, the timer will be activated even without any gSystem->ProcessEvents() method call.

In our implementation, LLDB’s expression evaluator does not enable the; ``-fbounds-safety`` language option because it’s currently unable to fully; reconstruct the pointers with external bounds annotations, and also because the; evaluator operates in C++ mode, utilizing C++ reference types, while; ``-fbounds-safety`` does not currently support C++.

The MIR and; FileCheck directives can be embedded using strings so you still have access to; the convenience available in llvm-lit. Debugging; ---------. One debugging technique that's proven particularly valuable is to use the; BlockExtractor to extract basic blocks into new functions. This can be used; to track down correctness bugs and can also be used to track down performance; regressions. It can also be coupled with function attributes to disable; GlobalISel for one or more of the extracted functions. .. image:: block-extract.png. The command to do the extraction is:. .. code-block:: shell. ./bin/llvm-extract -o - -S -b ‘foo:bb1;bb4’ <input> > extracted.ll. This particular example extracts two basic blocks from a function named ``foo``.; The new LLVM-IR can then be modified to add the ``failedISel`` attribute to the; extracted function containing bb4 to make that function use SelectionDAG. This can prevent some optimizations as GlobalISel is generally able to work on a; single function at a time. This technique can be repeated for different; combinations of basic blocks until you have identified the critical blocks; involved in a bug.

Though you're probably reading this because you want to write or maintain a; compiler backend, LLVM also fully supports building a native assembler.; We've tried hard to automate the generation of the assembler from the .td files; (in particular the instruction syntax and encodings), which means that a large; part of the manual and repetitive data entry can be factored and shared with the; compiler. Instruction Parsing; -------------------. .. note::. To Be Written. Instruction Alias Processing; ----------------------------. Once the instruction is parsed, it enters the MatchInstructionImpl function.; The MatchInstructionImpl function performs alias processing and then does actual; matching. Alias processing is the phase that canonicalizes different lexical forms of the; same instructions down to one representation. There are several different kinds; of alias that are possible to implement and they are listed below in the order; that they are processed (which is in order from simplest/weakest to most; complex/powerful). Generally you want to use the first alias mechanism that; meets the needs of your instruction, because it will allow a more concise; description. Mnemonic Aliases; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. The first phase of alias processing is simple instruction mnemonic remapping for; classes of instructions which are allowed with two different mnemonics. This; phase is a simple and unconditionally remapping from one input mnemonic to one; output mnemonic. It isn't possible for this form of alias to look at the; operands at all, so the remapping must apply for all forms of a given mnemonic.; Mnemonic aliases are defined simply, for example X86 has:. ::. def : MnemonicAlias<""cbw"", ""cbtw"">;; def : MnemonicAlias<""smovq"", ""movsq"">;; def : Mnemo",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst:81732,down,down,81732,interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/llvm/docs/CodeGenerator.rst,1,['down'],['down']

Some existing tests use ``RUN: true`` in extra files instead of just; putting the extra files in an ``Inputs/`` directory. This pattern is; deprecated. Fragile tests; -------------. It is easy to write a fragile test that would fail spuriously if the tool being; tested outputs a full path to the input file. For example, :program:`opt` by; default outputs a ``ModuleID``:. .. code-block:: console. $ cat example.ll; define i32 @main() nounwind {; ret i32 0; }. $ opt -S /path/to/example.ll; ; ModuleID = '/path/to/example.ll'. define i32 @main() nounwind {; ret i32 0; }. ``ModuleID`` can unexpectedly match against ``CHECK`` lines. For example:. .. code-block:: llvm. ; RUN: opt -S %s | FileCheck. define i32 @main() nounwind {; ; CHECK-NOT: load; ret i32 0; }. This test will fail if placed into a ``download`` directory. To make your tests robust, always use ``opt ... < %s`` in the RUN line.; :program:`opt` does not output a ``ModuleID`` when input comes from stdin. Platform-Specific Tests; -----------------------. Whenever adding tests that require the knowledge of a specific platform,; either related to code generated, specific output or back-end features,; you must make sure to isolate the features, so that buildbots that; run on different architectures (and don't even compile all back-ends),; don't fail. The first problem is to check for target-specific output, for example sizes; of structures, paths and architecture names, for example:. * Tests containing Windows paths will fail on Linux and vice-versa.; * Tests that check for ``x86_64`` somewhere in the text will fail anywhere else.; * Tests where the debug information calculates the size of types and structures.

Let us look at a simple example of a toy experiment comparing two; methods to fit a function to a histogram, the $\chi^{2}$. method and a method called ""binned log-likelihood fit"", both available in ROOT. As a very simple yet powerful quantity to check the quality of the fit; results, we construct for each pseudo-data set the so-called ""pull"", the; difference of the estimated and the true value of a parameter,; normalised to the estimated error on the parameter,; $\frac{(p_{estim} - p_{true})}{\sigma_{p}}$. If everything is OK, the; distribution of the pull values is a standard normal distribution, i.e.; a Gaussian distribution centred around zero with a standard deviation of one. The macro performs a rather big number of toy experiments, where a; histogram is repeatedly filled with Gaussian distributed numbers,; representing the pseudo-data in this example. Each time, a fit is; performed according to the selected method, and the pull is calculated; and filled into a histogram. Here is the code:. ``` {.cpp .numberLines}; @ROOT_INCLUDE_FILE macros/macro9.C; ```. Your present knowledge of ROOT should be enough to understand all the; technicalities behind the macro. Note that the variable `pull` in line; *61* is different from the definition above: instead of the parameter; error on `mean`, the fitted standard deviation of the distribution; divided by the square root of the number of entries,; `sig/sqrt(n_tot_entries)`, is used. - What method exhibits the better performance with the default; parameters ?. - What happens if you increase the number of entries per histogram by; a factor of ten ? Why ?. The answers to these questions are well beyond the scope of this guide.; Basically all books about statistical methods provide a complete; treatment of the aforementioned topics.

Availability,"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. Of course, this alignment scheme works best if the address points are; in fact aligned correctly. To make this more likely to happen, we insert; padding between virtual tables that in many cases aligns address points to; a power of 2. Specifically, our padding aligns virtual tables to the next; highest power of 2 bytes; because address points for specific base classes; normally appear at fixed offsets within the virtual table, this normally; has the effect of aligning the address points as well. This scheme introduces tradeoffs between decreased space overhead for; instructions and bit vectors and increased overhead in the form of padding. We; therefore limit the amount of padding so that we align to no more than 128; bytes. This number was found experimentally to provide a good tradeoff. Eliminating Bit Vector Checks for All-Ones Bit Vectors; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.

Dimitar et. al. proposed a novel approach that interleaves virtual tables in [1]_.; This approach is more efficient in terms of space because padding and bit vectors are no longer needed.; At the same time, it is also more efficient in terms of performance because in the interleaved layout; address points of the virtual tables are consecutive, thus the validity check of a virtual; vtable pointer is always a range check.

Deployability," #include ""test.h""; $ clang test.c -o test. In this example, ``clang`` will not automatically use the PCH file for; ``test.h`` since ``test.h`` was included directly in the source file and not; specified on the command line using ``-include-pch``. Relocatable PCH Files; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. It is sometimes necessary to build a precompiled header from headers; that are not yet in their final, installed locations. For example, one; might build a precompiled header within the build tree that is then; meant to be installed alongside the headers. Clang permits the creation; of ""relocatable"" precompiled headers, which are built with a given path; (into the build directory) and can later be used from an installed; location. To build a relocatable precompiled header, place your headers into a; subdirectory whose structure mimics the installed location. For example,; if you want to build a precompiled header for the header ``mylib.h``; that will be installed into ``/usr/include``, create a subdirectory; ``build/usr/include`` and place the header ``mylib.h`` into that; subdirectory. If ``mylib.h`` depends on other headers, then they can be; stored within ``build/usr/include`` in a way that mimics the installed; location. Building a relocatable precompiled header requires two additional; arguments. First, pass the ``--relocatable-pch`` flag to indicate that; the resulting PCH file should be relocatable. Second, pass; ``-isysroot /path/to/build``, which makes all includes for your library; relative to the build directory. For example:. .. code-block:: console. # clang -x c-header --relocatable-pch -isysroot /path/to/build /path/to/build/mylib.h mylib.h.pch. When loading the relocatable PCH file, the various headers used in the; PCH file are found from the system header root. For example, ``mylib.h``; can be found in ``/usr/include/mylib.h``. If the headers are installed; in some other system root, the ``-isysroot`` option can be used provide; a different system root from which",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst:48535,install,installed,48535,interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/interpreter/llvm-project/clang/docs/UsersManual.rst,1,['install'],['installed']

In this example, we will show how to extend a tree with a branch from; another tree with the Friends feature. ### Adding a Branch to an Existing Tree. You may want to add a branch to an existing tree. For example, if one; variable in the tree was computed with a certain algorithm, you may want; to try another algorithm and compare the results. One solution is to add; a new branch, fill it, and save the tree. The code below adds a simple; branch to an existing tree. Note that the `kOverwrite` option in the; `Write` method overwrites the existing tree. If it is not specified, two; copies of the tree headers are saved. ``` {.cpp}; void tree3AddBranch() {; TFile f(""tree3.root"",""update"");; Float_t new_v;; TTree *t3 = (TTree*)f->Get(""t3"");; TBranch *newBranch = t3-> Branch(""new_v"",&new_v,""new_v/F"");; //read the number of entries in the t3; Int_t nentries = (Int_t)t3->GetEntries();; for (Int_t i = 0; i < nentries; i++){; new_v= gRandom->Gaus(0,1);; newBranch->Fill();; }; t3->Write("""",TObject::kOverwrite); // save only the new version of; // the tree; }; ```. Adding a branch is often not possible because the tree is in a read-only; file and you do not have permission to save the modified tree with the; new branch. Even if you do have the permission, you risk loosing the; original tree with an unsuccessful attempt to save the modification.; Since trees are usually large, adding a branch could extend it over the; 2GB limit. In this case, the attempt to write the tree fails, and the; original data is may also be corrupted. In addition, adding a branch to; a tree enlarges the tree and increases the amount of memory needed to; read an entry, and therefore decreases the performance. For these; reasons, ROOT offers the concept of friends for trees (and chains). We; encourage you to use `TTree::AddFriend` rather than adding a branch; manually. ### TTree::A",MatchSource.DOCS,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md:51556,update,update,51556,documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/v6-32-06/documentation/users-guide/Trees.md,1,['update'],['update']

When you call the `Draw` method of a histogram ( **`TH1`**` ::Draw` ); for the first time, it creates a **`THistPainter`** object and saves a; pointer to painter as a data member of the histogram. The; **`THistPainter`** class specializes in the drawing of histograms. It; allows logarithmic axes (x, y, z) when the CONT drawing option is; using. The **`THistPainter`** class is separated from the histogram so; that one can have histograms without the graphics overhead, for; example in a batch program. The choice to give each histogram has its; own painter rather than a central singleton painter, allows two; histograms to be drawn in two threads without overwriting the; painter's values. When a displayed histogram is filled again, you do; not have to call the `Draw` method again. The image is refreshed the; next time the pad is updated. A pad is updated after one of these; three actions:. - A carriage control on the ROOT command line. - A click inside the pad. - A call to **`TPad`**`::Update()`. By default, the **`TH1`**`::Draw` clears the pad before drawing the; new image of the histogram. You can use the `""SAME""` option to leave; the previous display intact and superimpose the new histogram. The; same histogram can be drawn with different graphics options in; different pads. When a displayed histogram is deleted, its image is; automatically removed from the pad. To create a copy of the histogram; when drawing it, you can use **`TH1`**`::DrawClone()`. This will clone; the histogram and allow you to change and delete the original one; without affecting the clone. You can use **`TH1`**`::DrawNormalized()`; to draw a normalized copy of a histogram. ``` {.cpp}; TH1 *TH1::DrawNormalized(Option_t *option,Double_t norm) const; ```.
