Testability,"I realised I never replied to this. I suggested `2*rtol` in this case because the error propagation in this case would guarantee that this is always sufficient. For other tests, we can always design the test so that it's calculable what the error term should be. I'd say it's generally a good idea to have the tests be as tight as we can possibly make them without risking false-negatives on the results, because otherwise we're not properly testing that the parameters do what they say. Regardless, that test failure isn't due to any of my PRs - it's a pre-existing problem that we happened to get unlucky on this time round. It'll get fixed when I modify `test_mesolve.py`.

Testability,"I think `hypothesis` is the best method here in the long term, but it will most likely have to be a long-term goal. I think the main pro in favour of it is that it actually is making an attempt to remove randomness; it's attempting to comprehensively test a spanning set of input parameters, rather than just Monte-Carlo'ing our way through and hoping. There's a couple of points which make it difficult to implement:. 1. QuTiP can be quite fragile with respect to unexpected input formats, particularly in older parts of the code.; 2. Various components are only accurate up to some tolerance, and the error propagation to work out how that corresponds to useful measurable quantities can be rather tricky. Those are certainly both solvable problems, and point 1 in particular is just general improvement of usability. The second point is about designing the tests well, which again is certainly doable, but will take a while (it takes long enough just to refactor them, let alone a total rewrite of large chunks of them!).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-629272663:251,test,test,251,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-629272663,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"I think the module should really be `qutip.testing` (or `qutip.test` if the name's already taken), not `qutip.core.data.testing`, if you're going to add one. It's very likely to be the case in the future (if it isn't already) that you'll need additional dependencies to define the tests, and you don't want to force _all_ runtime users to have them to install QuTiP. If you put the package in a separate top-level module, it's _far_ easier to separate out all the code, and have `qutip/__init__.py` not import `qutip.testing`, so things won't break. Also, tests generally need to work with a fully imported version of the module. If we start putting testing infrastructure in the core, we're going to encode a whole lot of cyclical dependencies right away, or end up with `testing` modules scattered all across the codebase, for no real gain. For discovery: that would only happen during test generation, which comes after importing the modules and defining the classes, so you'd still be able to define tolerances and influence how the tests ran. The problem with _not_ having discovery is that it becomes very easy to forget to test a function, and with so much of the machinery automated, it's also easy to forget it when reviewing a PR. That's particularly true once you have external contributors writing these sorts of things - we have it in Qiskit, where people add things to our ""standard equivalence library"", and new contributors and new reviewers don't know where all the different tests are, so our discovery tests have helped catch bugs. That happens even with super experienced team members. I'd argue that code coverage metrics are possibly a better way of detecting missing tests - that fails safe if you add broken code and forget to test it, whereas having to specify the tests explicitly means you can accidentally add broken code to a dispatcher and not know, if you forgot to add the test.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-981562735:43,test,testing,43,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-981562735,17,['test'],"['test', 'testing', 'tests']"

The direct method runs out of memory so I was trying all sorts of iterative methods. My conclusion was that the BicgSTAB method is the best for my particular problem. However, the iterative methods are very sensitive to basically everything this is why there are so many different kinds of them. Moreover, the Scipy realisation of these methods is not the most optimal. PyAMG realisation of bicgSTAB worked better for me than the one from scipy. So, please, keep both of the methods in qutip.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/29#issuecomment-20661092:75,test,testing,75,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/29#issuecomment-20661092,1,['test'],['testing']

We could fix the random seed for any test which uses random methods with a fixture to get around that. I actually think this is a true failure; the default solver `rtol = 1e-6`, but here we're using `rtol=1e-7` as the test, so the test is bugged (it's probably not the only one, and I may have missed some of these in `mcsolve` too).

Testability,"I'm not at all a fan of making tests part of the public interface like this. It's something that we make absolutely no stability guarantees about, and coupling downstream packages to our own tests just sounds like a recipe for disaster - if we find a bug in main QuTiP and need to change tests or add methods (which we should be able to do completely freely), we're going to inject a ton of extra code into downstream packages, and may completely break them. To be honest, I'm not even wild about how we distribute our tests as part of the module code at all, but that's what we've got. It _could_ be ok if you import the test case base, and redefine your tests from there. We still don't make any stability guarantees about that, but it's conceivable that we could (though of course, the problem of ""what if we need to add methods"" persists). That would also solve your problems about saying you can't import individual tests.

Testability,"I'm not sure about that, for two reasons. First, `super_tensor` doesn't implement a tensor product but a useful combination of reshuffling and the tensor product that, so calling it `tensor` alone may result in confusion when trying to match to the mathematics of papers and lecture notes which use the tensor product more literally. Second, it's a pretty significant break with previous behavior, such that if someone has implemented reshuffling themselves, that would then stop working if `tensor()` dispatches based on `is_super`. As an alternative, maybe some new function with a name like `composite()` that calls `tensor()` or `super_tensor()` respectively? That way, you're referring to the logical act of compositing two systems together, rather than to the mathematics behind it, and could leave code invariant when changing from unitaries to CPTP maps.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/241#issuecomment-57070065:698,log,logical,698,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/241#issuecomment-57070065,1,['log'],['logical']
Testability,"I'm not sure solution 3 will work as easily as this - if the user's `scipy.linalg.eigh` is broken, then calling it doesn't help, surely?. Also, I can reproduce the segfaults with both `np.ascontiguousarray` and `np.asfortranarray` on my machine, but it is a size of 64 that seems to reliably do me in. Script to reproduce:; ```python; import numpy as np; from scipy.linalg import eigh. def random_hermitian(n):; h = np.random.rand(n, n) + 1j*np.random.rand(n, n); return h + np.conj(h.T). for n in range(1, 101):; print(n); for _ in [None]*100:; x = eigh(np.ascontiguousarray(random_hermitian(n))); ```; and this segfaults on `n=64` reliably with the `pip` version of `scipy` (linked against OpenBLAS 0.3.7), and always succeeds with the `conda` version (linked against MKL 2019.4). Both `scipy` versions are 1.4.1 here. I did the most bare-bones install to test this:; ```; $ conda create -n blastest python; $ conda activate blastest; $ pip install scipy; $ python blas.py; ```; where `blas.py` is the repro script above. Doing this, `pip` pulls me OpenBLAS 0.3.7. Looking at the source of OpenBLAS, the whole heavy-lifting implementation is in Fortran - there's the classic LAPACKe C wrapper around the core Fortran LAPACK, but everything eventually goes down to the Fortran. If it helps, it's an out-of-bounds access error that causes the segfault for me, and the address it's trying to access doesn't look like dummy nonsense (`0x101b95010`). I'm pretty sure it's a nasty Mac/OpenBLAS bug. If the problem is particularly in `zheevr` we could swap the call to `eig` (instead of `eigh`) for Mac only, which should hopefully sidestep the problem, because it'll call `zgeev` instead. All recent pip installs of `scipy` link against OpenBLAS, so there's not much that can sidestep it there, other than mandating `conda` usage, because you can't relink `scipy` to decent libraries without compiling from source.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1197#issuecomment-628780955:858,test,test,858,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1197#issuecomment-628780955,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"I'm sorry I don't have a huge amount of time at the moment, but just to add an extra point (that it looks like I didn't think about before): if we _do_ add this, then any method that requires an unconditional `import qutip` in downstream packages probably isn't a suitable solution - `import qutip` already takes far too long (though a lot of this is importing various parts of `scipy`, which another library might do on our behalf), and it means that they'd have to do their own import checking to handle optional dependencies. In that sense, (ab)using Python's duck-typing with a magic method might be the best way to break the dependency/import problem. I'm definitely still against implicit conversion to `Qobj` in pretty much any situation - I can imagine we could define a safe, fairly forward-compatible interface for letting people do `qutip.Qobj(x)`, but as it stands, that's the limit that I'd want the interface to be used for. I particularly am really against the idea of implicit conversion. I don't see an advantage to allowing QuTiP functions to act implicitly on other objects; it means our own functions are slower (because we have to explicitly test inputs on _everything_), and it restricts us more from improving `Qobj`'s internals, because we have to maintain compatibility with the interface. We'd never really be able to output anything _other_ than a `Qobj` without this, so there's no reason not to just have the user convert the inputs to `Qobj` explicitly themselves - that isolates the efficiency penalty so you only pay it if you need it, and it'll likely be clearer in the end anyway, because explicit is better for following the logic than implicit.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-908380301:1163,test,test,1163,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-908380301,2,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'test']"

One expects the mathematical operations performed by different data backends to give the same results but setting `auto_tidyup` to `[""CSR""]` by default will break that assumption quite badly. For example, matrices might become singular when sparse and not when dense. There is also a danger of making some benchmarks artificially fast.

There is a question here of whether we should specify our minimum supported numpy in ""install_requires"" in ""setup.cfg"" or not. - The majority of our test matrix should *build* qutip with oldest-supported-numpy to match what we distribute. - We should include at least one test run for the oldest numpy we require (i.e. oldest NEP) and one for the most recent (i.e. latest numpy). . - We should include at least one test run for the oldest Python we support and one for the newest. - We should include at least one test run for the oldest SciPy we support and one for the newest. - The NEP doesn't say anything about SciPy, but I propose we select the oldest SciPy that supports our oldest NEP numpy.

Testability,"If it's something we want to support, we'll need a bit of a rewrite of the data-layer testing infrastructure, but nothing too major. I'd be in favour of a bit of a larger restructure:; - rearrange the repo root to have `/src/qutip` and `/test/qutip` instead of `/qutip/tests` (I originally didn't like it, but I now see more and more benefits of the `/src` (or `/lib`) convention in Python projects).; - the current `qutip/tests` should entirely become `/test/qutip`; - a new `/src/qutip/test` becomes a fully-supported _public_ module, including base classes (such as the data-layer mixins) and things like that. We'd need to be careful, because reducing your possibilities for flexibility in testing generally sounds like a bad idea to me, but if we take care to be very limited, it could work. I suspect you won't be able to import the test suite from inside `qutip.core.data` because of cyclical dependencies, which is probably a good thing - it'll force us to put the structure the right way round immediately. For an idea pretty far out of left field:; - the data layer tests should really _discover_ the specialisations rather than us needing to specify them (this is true regardless of this PR); - if so, in the new form, we _could_ directly export this part of the test suite from `qutip.test` (our test suite would import this as well), and add a little bit of logic to allow filtering of which tests need to be run (class decorators, probably); - downstream packages could then test just by importing our classes and disabling any specialisations that are only on internal data-layer objects. I'm not 100% sure how I feel about this, but it's plausible - we'd still be able to add extra methods in our own test suite if we wanted them, because we could just derive from the classes, rather than defining the names into the test suite in those cases. ---.

Testability,"If we don't do `del numpy` in qutip's `__init__.py`, then doing this works:. ```; from import qutip *; numpy.func(...); ```. because numpy was imported but not deleted before the end of qutips init file, and it will be exported form qutip as a global symbol in qutips namespace (which is the callers global name space if called as above). However, this is not a desired behaviour of a module to do like this: importing qutip shouldn't impose that numpy is imported in any particular way (even though qutip uses numpy internally). For example, if a user prefer to import numpy as `np`, then it is pointless that qutip exposes numpy as `numpy` as well. It because even weirder when an import pattern like `import qutip as q` is used, because as it is now then numpy is available through `q.numpy`, which is unnecessary and causes problem with for example nose unit testing of qutip module (because it finds numpy and run all numpy tests as well) and also with module autocompletion in for example spyder and ipython. For these and many other similar reasons, it is neatest if qutip only exports its own symbols, and if a users requires any symbols of other packages they should be explicitly imported from those packages.

Testability,"If you click into ""Files changed"" you can just tick the files as you've looked at them. To make it easier for you, I'd suggest having a copy of the old version next to them and reading the full commit message, because I usually explain what I'm doing in them and why I'm doing it that way. If you're worried about the size of the PR in total, then I'd strongly recommend _not_ squashing this PR if/when it's merged, but instead just rebasing it onto `master` or doing a direct merge. That way it doesn't look huge, it looks like a series of commits which each change one file, which is what you'd get if the PR was initially split. The review doesn't end at the point the code is merged - somebody in the future may very well want to see why I made certain changes.

Testability,"In general in pytest we use the bare keyword `assert` for almost everything. All the functions in `np.testing` are from the ""before times"", when test tooling wasn't as good as it is nowadays - they were a big improvement on available warning messages back before 2015. Nowadays, though, `pytest` does introspection on assertion failures, so it has even better message reporting than the `np.testing` functions, and it lets you write much clearer code. For example, `assert_equal(x, y)` is much better spelled in pytest as `assert x == y`, because it's much faster to read and pytest does better error reporting for it. Similarly, testing for exceptions is better with; ```python; with pytest.raises(ValueError):; call_that_raises(1, ""hello, world""); ```; as opposed to the numpy form `np.testing.assert_raises(ValueError, call_that_raises, 1, ""hello, world"")` - the pytest one is much easier to read, and the error message is better. The only numpy one we still use is `np.testing.assert_allclose` when we're comparing several numpy arrays. That's just because `pytest` doesn't have a good function that's aware of multidimensional arrays (at least not one that I know). This file still has a load of old numpy testing code in it (e.g. `np.testing.assert_equal`) because it was written quite a long time ago, when that was the recommended way of doing things. We're changing over slowly, so we can take advantage of all the nice features of pytest. In this case, I changed `np.testing.assert_allclose(x, y, atol=tol)` to `assert abs(x - y) < tol`. I removed `np.testing.assert_allclose`, because that gives the mistaken impression that we're comparing arrays (we're not, we're comparing two scalars). I could have changed it to `assert x == pytest.approx(y, tol=tol)`, except in this case the test file hasn't been converted to `pytest` style yet, and I wanted to keep the total change of this PR as small as possible.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1498#issuecomment-822737671:46,assert,assert,46,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1498#issuecomment-822737671,16,"['assert', 'test']","['assert', 'assertion', 'test', 'testing']"
Testability,"In general the biggest thing you should consider is readability, and to be fair, that's a little subjective. You're welcome to comment on my PR if you think I've done anything that's unreadable. You can scope fixtures at whatever level is appropriate. In this particular case, I scoped the `dimension` fixture at the module level, because there's loads of places that needed to test varying dimensions, and it's very convenient to define it just once. In the few cases where we needed to override that (e.g. in `dnorm`), I overrode it by providing a definition in a tighter scope - either at class level or per-function (via `pytest.mark.parametrize` directly). The correct scoping just depends a lot on the type of tests you're writing - if you're going to have to overwrite something constantly then module scoping isn't good, but if you have lots of different functions to test, and every test for a given function will want the same parametrisation, then class scoping might be a good choice. If you only need the parametrisation once, then it's best to put it right next to the place it's used (like in the case of mine that you've highlighted). It means that if you've opened that file to read the tests, then everything you need to understand `Test_fidelity.test_known_cases` will be on your screen if you just scroll to it. That makes it much easier for the next person who has to come along to edit your code. I used a couple of temporary variables in that case just to aid readability - my cases wouldn't have nicely fit on one line if I'd shoved the `qutip.basis(2, 0)` stuff inside the `pytest.param` constructors, and it would be hard to read. This way you can easily verify that the code is correct bit-by-bit; you can see clearly that the names are descriptive and match exactly what they say, and that means you can trust them when they then appear in the parametrisation.

Testability,"It seems to work now (the failing test is unrelated). I will briefly summarize what I found out and changed. Setting up and using an MPI environment is surprisingly difficult, and I don't think it is in the scope of qutip to try and make that easier, or guide users to do that. The philosophy here is, if the user can get the `mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor` to work, then they can also use `mpi_pmap` in qutip. However, I did show in the tutorial notebook explicitly as an example how it works on the RIKEN cluster, and I refer to the mpi4py users guide. That being said, we do want to set up an automated test for this, and we do want to understand what went wrong in our initial attempts to set up those tests. The two main problems we encountered were (a) if mpi4py is installed with pip, all mpi_pmap calls hang; (b) if it is installed with conda, test_map_pass_error hangs sometimes.; The difference between pip and conda comes from the fact that mpi4py requires an MPI implementation. If we use mpi4py's GH workflow to install it with pip, it installs MPICH, and with conda, it installs OpenMPI by default. I noticed that in both cases where mpi_pmap hangs, there *are* error messages, but they are captured by pytest and then never printed because the program hangs... Regarding problem (a), in short, it looks like an MPICH bug to me. I thus decided to use OpenMPI instead, and added `conda install ""openmpi<5"" mpi4py` to just one of our test runs (the python 3.12 one). Regarding problem (b), the problem was that we requested more processes than the default number of slots available. With OpenMPI, the default number of slots available is the number of physical cpu cores (which seems to be 2 on the machine running our tests, leaving only one slot for a worker process). In the `parallel` module, if num_cpus is not provided, it defaults to `available_cpu_count()` (which is 4 on this machine, since there are 4 logical cpus). We could try to find a better default value for num_cpus for ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2296#issuecomment-1923102432:34,test,test,34,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2296#issuecomment-1923102432,3,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Previously some operations that went via the sparse data layer may have been tidied up and now they are not. The use of `p != 0` existed in version 4 and is, I think, correct in this particular case. If a POVM is supplied as a list of operators, and some of those operators have zero probability, then one cannot provide a normalized final density matrix, but one still needs to return a value to the user, since they specifically asked about that POVM. Perhaps qutip-qip could apply a tolerance itself on the returned probabilities?.

Testability,"It would maybe be good to keep everything in one PR that can be squashed into a single commit at the end - this is only a single ""logical"" change at the end of the day. Nice to get these things tidied up. You probably need to run all the tests locally before just pushing to check if everything works; QuTiP has quite a few code generation steps and indirect evaluation that can't be detected with static analysis, which is why you're seeing a lot of test failures (though that's _mostly_ `.pyx` files). Something seems wrong with the static analyser if it's not spotting that `Qobj` is used _everywhere_, though, and I notice in several commits it has a lot of false positives for removal. I can't imagine any situation where a static analyser should remove an in-library import from an `__init__.py` file, but it's done that in a couple of places.

Testability,"Just that we also have '_noise_direct()' which does a bit of linear algebra to avoid using the pseudo-inverse. i think it can be a bit more numerically efficient than mucking around with the inverse itself. Maybe doing the pseudo-inverse tends to involve a big large dense matrix, and this avoids it?. iirc, the logic of noise_direct is, since we write the pseudo-inverse like $R=QL^{-1}Q$, the annoying term we have to evaluate in the noise expression is something like:. $$y = I QL^{-1} Q I \rho. $$. so we substitute, for the last few terms. $$x = L^{-1} QI\rho $$. we multiply from the left by L, to get. $$L x = Q I \rho$$. and we can find x using a scipy's solve or something equivalent, and then find y with. $$y = IQ x$$. In the skewness you have this new term,. $$y =I R R I P I \rho$$. which is a bit clunky to manipulate.; maybe we can write something like. $$x = L^{-1}QIPI \rho$$. and again, multiplying by L. $$Lx = QIPI \rho$$. to get x, then the original expression is now. $$y = IQL^{-1}QQx$$. defining a new variable. $$t = L^{-1}QQx$$. we can again, multiply by L. $$Lt = QQx$$,. solve for t, then we get . $$y= IQ t$$. ? i probably made a mistake, so take with a grain of salt!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2435#issuecomment-2138882230:312,log,logic,312,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2435#issuecomment-2138882230,1,['log'],['logic']

This would allow selectively tuning logging for different submodules if requried, and there we not be any need for checking if qutip.settings.debug is set or to set logging levels explicitly in any submodules (as currently in done in the steadystate module for example).

Testability,"Makes sense, thank your for the explanation Eric! While trying to set a sensible value for `tol` I got the problem that 3% of the times the tests fail independently of the `tol` value. This is because the numpy function returns `nan` whereas `trace_csr` does not. To replicate the problem I used the following code:; ```python; import qutip; import scipy; import numpy as np; from qutip.tests.core.data import conftest. # Catch one of those matrices that return nan in the nuclear norm; for i in range(100):; matrix_csr = conftest.random_csr((100,100), 0.001, True); matrix = matrix_csr.to_array() ; result = np.linalg.norm(matrix, 'nuc'). # If it is nan store the matrix for analysis.; if np.isnan(result):; print('got one of those tricky matrices'); nan_matrix = matrix ; nan_matrix_csr = matrix_csr; ; # Scipy's and numpys methods return nan; sc_norm = scipy.linalg.norm(nan_matrix, 'nuc'); print(f'SciPy linalgn nuc norm: {sc_norm}'). np_norm = np.linalg.norm(nan_matrix, 'nuc'); print(f'NumPy linalgn nuc norm: {np_norm}'). # Using svd wich is similar to what numpy/scipy should be doing; u, s, vh = np.linalg.svd(nan_matrix); print(f'SVD method: {s.sum()}'). # Qutip sparse method; print(f'QuTiP trace_csr:{qutip.data.norm.trace_csr(nan_matrix_csr)}'). # This prints; # SciPy linalgn nuc norm: nan; # NumPy linalgn nuc norm: nan; # SVD method: 6.456744360029763; # QuTiP trace_csr:6.456744366739419; ```. As you can see in the above code, it fails to compute a value for NumPy/SciPy but not for a direct method (SVD) or the QuTiP method (which is different to the SVD method but still works). @Ericgig, do you get the same results? They look quite weird and I wonder if I am doing something wrong or whether this is a NumPy/SciPy bug. ```; np.__version__='1.21.2'; qutip.__version__='5.0.0.dev0+7a90dbd'; scipy.__version__='1.7.0'; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1635#issuecomment-930224872:140,test,tests,140,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1635#issuecomment-930224872,2,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"Not to discourage you from contributing, but there's already been some movement on #1208 in #1209. About tests: `qutip` uses `pytest` now, so the preferred method is actually just a bare `assert`, because `pytest` does introspection on the variables on an assertion failure. But yes, any changes to that should be in a new PR, because it's a different logical unit of work. There's some movement on that too (e.g. #1181). About pep8 changes: I'm not a maintainer, but it might be a good idea to be conservative about changing actual public APIs in the name of pep8. Changing public APIs that work fine means the users, who are the reason we're writing the code in the first place, have to adjust, and the pep8 spec explicitly warns against breaking backwards compatibility to match the pep. `N` is fairly consistent within `qutip` for the number of qubits, and the `U` in `U_list` refers to unitary matrices, which are conventionally a capital `U` in mathematical writing. You could argue that `U_list` should perhaps be called `unitaries`, but again, there's a degree of backwards-compatibility that should be maintained.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1212#issuecomment-603560557:105,test,tests,105,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1212#issuecomment-603560557,4,"['assert', 'log', 'test']","['assert', 'assertion', 'logical', 'tests']"

Testability,"Note: in theory you can install QuTiP from the test PyPI server right now by doing; ```; pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple qutip-jakelishman; ```; (that's just the name - you still do `import qutip`) but since it's on the ""wrong"" server, you first have to manually install `numpy` and `scipy`. When it's released properly on PyPI it'll handle the dependencies correctly - this is only an artifact of being on the testing server. Running that command will install a binary version with no compilation, and should work on any (reasonable) Linux machine, Mac (possibly not M1 chips) and Windows. It's possible you may get an error about `ndarray size changed ... this may indicate binary incompatibility` - if so, either force `numpy` up to the new 1.20 or down to 1.19 (whichever one you don't have). This was a breaking change in numpy 1.20. Per my reading of the release notes, it won't be an issue provided in the future we always build against `numpy>=1.20` (even when using lower `numpy` at runtime) because the new version updates a certain C-API macro to take into account the possibility of runtime variability. I have pushed an additional change to the build requirements to ensure this always happens. This has another knock-on effect: numpy 1.20 only supports Python 3.7+ (released June 2017). Currently, officially QuTiP supports Python 3.6, but I think it's reasonable to follow numpy's footsteps and **drop support for python 3.6 from qutip 5.0**. It's offset by gaining support for 3.9. (Apologies for all the force-pushing - whenever I want to re-run a test release on my own branch I have to temporarily add an extra commit to swap to the testing server, then force-push a rewind of this PR's branch.)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1429#issuecomment-770459519:47,test,test,47,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1429#issuecomment-770459519,5,['test'],"['test', 'testing']"

Testability,"Oh, I completely agree with the argument nested loops/if/else. I was more talking about the logistic depth requirement (edit: wrong again, it is called Cognitive Complexity) of code climate. I just realized that is not the climate issue here. But, anyway, indeed `circuit.py` is quite messy. And the Gate class is more or less just a place holder. A refactoring to define each gate as a subclass should make things much easier. Also for this latex method. I like it very much what is going on in `dev.major`!. Tbh the millions of `_gate_resolved` functions are actually already after a short refactoring last year by a brave volunteer. It used to be 400-line functions. That was horrible. Just like the `adjacent_gates` method in `spinchain.py` (another F). I haven't dared to touch it... > For say qobj.py, the master version has maintainability F, while `dev.major` has maintainability A with the only issues being TODOs and like 5 pep8s. That's amazing!

Testability,"Ok there are two issues here. 1. Scipy `atol` keyword argument has only been introduced in Scipy 1.1, the latest version.

Thus, had to move to the Trusty build stack. 2) Although it took forever to hunt down, it appears that when .pyx files are included as package data, Py27 may try to rebuild them upon calling **init**.

Testability,"Ok, it turns out I got the numpy release notes the wrong way round; we have to build our binaries with `1.16.6 <= numpy < 1.20` to maintain ABI compatibility no matter the numpy version. I have updated the compiler infrastructure to take this into account - this is in some ways a temporary restriction until two or three years in the future when we can drop support for all numpy versions less than 1.20. This is ready for final review. If you're fast, you can also try installing from the test PyPI server to see if the wheels work for you. While it's on the temporary server, you need to install `numpy` and `scipy` manually yourself (as they don't exist on test.pypi.org), but pip will do the dependencies correctly for you once it's publishing to the full repo.; ```bash; conda create -n pypi-test; conda install python pip numpy scipy; pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple qutip-jakelishman; python -c 'import qutip; qutip.about()'; ```. @hodgestar, @nathanshammah: perhaps you could just glance over this again and make sure everything looks right to you? Simon, I know you already looked over it once, so if you've not got time again, no problem - barely anything has changed since you last saw it. Nathan: in theory once we're in a position where deployments push to PyPI I think I can write an action for qutip/qutip.github.io to push a commit updating the website with the new information too. However, with the docs currently using a completely separate build process in a different repo, they can't really be triggered by a release here.

Testability,"Ok, so I did some benchmarking at https://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/goerz/34af142b78d7e344417d838bbea78aaf/06_example_3states_benchmark.ipynb ([gist](https://gist.github.com/goerz/34af142b78d7e344417d838bbea78aaf)), based on [one of the example notebooks from the Krotov package](https://qucontrol.github.io/krotov/v1.2.1/notebooks/06_example_3states.html). I'll be referring to the numbered cells in that notebook in the discussion below. @jakelishman in https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-859873615:. > I think you might be able to achieve a lot of what you want already. The pseudo-code looks like it's not using `mesolve` super efficiently, though maybe it's only because of simplifications to make a MWE. For example, if your controls are piecewise constant, then it might be inefficient to represent those terms as ""time dependent""; doing so means you incur the cost of multiplying each term by a scalar at every intermediate step the integrator chooses to take, then you have to perform the matrix-vector product for each one individually and add them up. That's certainly worth trying: when calling `mesolve` in a loop over the time grid, I did indeed see a significant speedup when summing the Lindbladian into a single constant `Qobj`, see `In [21]` vs `In [24]`. On the other hand, it doesn't always give a speedup: in the low-level [`DensityMatrixODEPropagator`](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/propagators.py#L162) it actually makes the propagation slower, see `In [29]` vs `In [32]`. It's a bit surprising, but then, as you say:. > [...] This isn't guaranteed, because it involves copying rather more data _before_ the call. So that's ok. > Would something like this work for you? [...]; >; > By giving `mesolve` the Liouvillian instead of the Hamiltonian and collapse operators separately.

Testability,"Ok, yeah, I definitely see the use-case here. I'll leave it removed from `matmul` for the time being because I hadn't really organised that code to allow safe calling of the function with an `out` parameter, but I'll look to re-instate it, similarly with `add`. For `add`: I envisage a nice possibility for `QobjEvo` using `CSR` backing along the vein of `CQobjEvoTdMatched`: on instantiation we add together all the matrices, then we `memset` all zeroes along the `data` array and store it as `self._structure`. Then each time we `__call__` the object, we simply do `out = self._structure.copy()`, and use that as the output matrix, because we guarantee we'll always have enough space and the correct structure. There's a couple of minor kinks in the logic of `add_csr` that we might have to iron out in order to avoid an additional matrix addition, but the savings in memory allocation could be good. You're absolutely right about the `pxd` files - I haven't taken enough care to make sure they've got all the definitions in yet.

Testability,"On the `test_dqd_current()` test: it appears that the problem is with the element 14 in the `eps_vec`. I did some more checking with different values for `eps_vec`, and there are other values which give problems, you can see the code below. . I defined a function that returns the values for a given value of `eps`:. ```python; def current_noise_eps(eps):; H = (eps/2 * sz + tc * sx); L = qutip.liouvillian(H, c_ops); rhoss = qutip.steadystate(L); current, noise = qutip.countstat_current_noise(L, [],; rhoss=rhoss,; J_ops=J_ops). current2 = qutip.countstat_current(L, rhoss=rhoss, J_ops=J_ops); assert abs(current - current2) < 1e-8. current2 = qutip.countstat_current(L, c_ops, J_ops=J_ops); assert abs(current - current2) < 1e-8. current_target = (tc**2 * GammaR; / (tc**2 * (2+GammaR/GammaL) + GammaR**2/4 + eps**2)); noise_target = current_target * (; 1 - (8*GammaL*tc**2*(4 * eps**2 * (GammaR - GammaL); + GammaR*(3*GammaL*GammaR + GammaR**2 + 8*tc**2)); / (4*tc**2*(2*GammaL + GammaR) + GammaL*GammaR**2; + 4*eps**2*GammaL)**2); ). return current.flatten()[0], current_target, noise.flatten()[0], noise_target, rhoss; ```. Now I have the following:. ```; >>> res = current_noise_eps(1.04); >>> print(res[2:4]); (0.06374906663351243, 0.0011104778081249154); ```. So the `noise` is quite different from `noise_target`.

Testability,"Parallel map function having different behaviour on different OS is not new, it's quite annoying.; I am quite surprised (and sad) that it Mac that is going fine for this one. Most cluster are using linux, so I would be fine to just run the test once on linux... I understand that you are developing with a mpi enable cluster, not just your local machine. Do you use `mpiexec` when running the tests? Maybe not using it with pytest could have side effects. Maybe mpi4py's [discussions board](https://github.com/mpi4py/mpi4py/discussions) could help?

Testability,"Perfect, that's what I thought thanks. `git cherry-pick` isn't a good choice for merging, because it creates new commit objects. Doing that means we never explicitly told git how the two implementations should be picked going forwards, and so any additional changes on `dev.major` _also_ could never be merged in, because they'd have different commits as their parents. Logically it's a merge operation and this is a ""true"" merge conflict, so the right thing to do is to tell git how to solve the conflict. I've already got a fixed merge all ready to go - once we've got #1440 merged I'll make the PR up, so `dev.major` is once again completely ahead of `master`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1289#issuecomment-779255284:370,Log,Logically,370,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1289#issuecomment-779255284,1,['Log'],['Logically']

Testability,"Regarding your questions:. - It's the same in QuTiP 5 currently. I am creating a PR also for that version, but I will include support for multiple coupling operators to the PR.; - Yes, I will add a test for this.; - This parameter is only relevant for `fmmesolve` ( master equation solver ). There is already the parameter `kmax` which sets the truncation of sidebands to be considered for the integration of the coupling operator. The integral to solve reads as:. $$ \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T dt e^{-ik\Omega t} f(t) $$. where $k \in \[-k_{max}, k_{max} \]$ and $f(t)$ is a $T$-periodic function.

But the solver tolerance is for the state itself, not expectation values and other scalars obtained from them. The test is not to check numerical error.

Testability,"Repeating just changes the probability of failure, rather than actually detecting whether it was a rare fail, and `mesolve` tests aren't always the fastest, so repetition here isn't great. For simple unitary qubit operations, I think it should be easy enough to work out how the tolerance translates. It's difficult to say that if there's a numerical error then the error will be much greater - I caught some errors in the `test_gates.py` (I think) that were sneaking through because the tolerances were set too high.

I found that removing the comment would have left a very odd function that was used to decorate test cases, which isn't necessary in `pytest` so much because you can use parametrisation, more description function names, and grouping in `Test*` classes to achieve the same goal with less custom wrappers. Once I was on that, I kind of got carried away changing the rest of the file.

Testability,"Solvers: absolutely the solvers should always be packaged with the main `qutip`. I had sort of envisaged that we'd put them in a `solve` package, which would be exported into the main namespace just like `core` is. This way is more just for greater separation, so that the full core isn't entangled with the solvers themselves - I think separating them like this will help us ensure that we specify the data layer API much more cleanly if the solvers aren't referenced within it. (i.e. there's no reference to any solver within `core`, but the API is built sufficiently cleanly that they can still access all the internals). OpenMP check: I think there's two neater ways:; 1. perhaps `settings` should just be in `core` too? I avoided putting the check in `core/__init__.py` because I'm really trying to avoid bi-directional dependencies between the packages, but moving `settings.py` into `core` would solve that.; 2. alternatively, we could just write `settings.py` as part of `setup.py` - determine whether we built against OpenMP/MKL at compile-time, and then just write it in? We can still choose whether or not to use it in various runtime situations. As for the current test - yeah, the comparative complexity is kind of indicative that this isn't the right way to do it. It's a relatively straightforward use of `importlib`, but still it's more difficult.

I have removed `self.gates` as well as `self.gates_and_measurements`. The replacement is the more ""general"" (and less of a mouthful) `self.circuit_ops` which contains both. I still allow `propagators` function to be allowed in this case (because it is useful internally in `run`). However, now if a circuit with measurement needs to call `resolve_gates` or `adjacent_gates`, it needs to add measurements after the fact. . @BoxiLi, any opinions ?

Testability,Some updates:. 1. All measurements (except the one in the computational basis) have now been moved to qutip/measurement.py. The interface for the previous measurement style (using observables and eigenstates) remains the same. The only difference is that the `measure` and `measurement_statistics` functions now act as dispatch functions that can carry out projective measurements instead when the `op : list of projection operators` ; 2. I have moved all measurement tests to qutip/tests/test_measurement.py as well as moved all measurement tests to pytest style,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1274#issuecomment-643731499:468,test,tests,468,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1274#issuecomment-643731499,3,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"Sorry for such a long delay... @QuantumFall This issue somehow escaped from my email list and I never noticed it. This is actually a situation often encountered when testing just one gate. If Hamiltonian acts trivially on the state for a few time steps, the adaptive solver may decide on a step size so large that all the reaming pulses are skipped. Set the max step size fixes it:; ```python; options = qutip.Options(max_step=0.05); processor_state = processor.run_state(init_state, options=options).states[-1].tidyup(1.0e-6); ```. Usually, this is because the Hamiltonian is 0 at the first few steps. This example is actually slightly different. The first pulse is a non-trivial (sxsx+sysy) (swap-like). Maybe it is because it has no effect on the initial state `(0,0,0,1)`. But `(1,0,0,0)` seems to work well. It seems really necessary to adaptively choose a step size for the simulators.

Testability,"Sorry, I made some mistakes in my previous post, and you are right on the paper. I think I can summarize the two MC simulation strategies into two kinds: one is that we generate a random number at each time step, and then compare it with the jumping probability (**1-P(no jump)**), and decide which jump to make using the jumping operators; the other one is that we generate a random number, and let it to be the no-jumping probability, and let the system evolve until it ends at the so-called waiting time by judging if the probability of no-jumping reaches the generated random number, and then decide which state to jump. My hope is that our mcsolve function can allow users to choose which strategy to employ in the simulation, as both of the strategies are valuable for different purposes, as I have claimed in my earlier thread. This is the feature I am looking for. Is that feasible and reasonable? . I read over the mcsolve code a little bit. From my understanding, the core algorithm of the MC simulation is in the ODE's single-trajectory definition part (_mc_alg_evolve...). Looks like the code is applying the second strategy I mentioned before. But I am not totally sure, as I am confused and got lost on many variables. Like, what does the RHS of the ODE mean? How comes the **array[1, 10, 11]**? ... . At this stage, I have to resort to the original author of the code, and would like to hear your opinions and detailed guidelines. I will write some test codes in Matlab first in the coming weeks, if I have time. Thanks for your response.

Testability,"Sorry, my holidays were not that long... Here are some tests of the proposed modifications. 1 ) Computation of the weight; The proposed modification may lead to a large change of the weight in some circumstances.; For example :; ```; H = sigmaz(); c_op_list = [1e-8*sigmap()]; L = liouvillian(H, c_op_list); n = H.shape[0]; b = np.zeros(n ** 2); print(L.data.todense()). [[ 0.e+00+0.j 0.e+00+0.j 0.e+00+0.j 1.e-16+0.j]; [ 0.e+00+0.j -5.e-17+2.j 0.e+00+0.j 0.e+00+0.j]; [ 0.e+00+0.j 0.e+00+0.j -5.e-17-2.j 0.e+00+0.j]; [ 0.e+00+0.j 0.e+00+0.j 0.e+00+0.j -1.e-16+0.j]]; ```. The elements of the Liouvillian have modulus close to unity, which should be reflected in the value of the weight. ```; # Current version; weight = np.mean(np.abs(L.data.data.max())); print('Weight',weight); b[0] = weight; Ldense = L.data.todense(); Ldense[0, :] = +np.diag(weight*np.ones(n)).reshape((1, n ** 2)); rho1 = np.linalg.solve(Ldense, b). Weight 1.0000000000000001e-16. # Proposed modified version; weight = np.mean(np.abs(L.data).max(0)).real # added .real to get a float ; print('Weight',weight); b[0] = weight; Ldense = L.data.todense(); Ldense[0, :] = +np.diag(weight*np.ones(n)).reshape((1, n ** 2)); rho2 = np.linalg.solve(Ldense, b). Weight 1.0; ```. The current version leads to a very small weight because the imaginary part is discarded. Also, the mean is not doing anything. The proposed modification computes the modulus before evaluating the maximum for each line and then takes the mean. This may change the final steady state in some circumstances, but I could not rapidly find a situation where this is actually important. In this example, the two steady states are the same even though the weights are very different.; ```; np.linalg.norm(rho1-rho2); >> 1.1102230246251565e-16; ```. 2 ) Construction of the matrix to obtain the steady state; As mentioned by @fminga, this should not change anything in most situations.

Testability,"Thank you for such a quick response. I'm sorry for not getting back to you sooner. > First of all, are you sure that either of DrudeLorentzBath and DrudeLorentzPadeBath give the right solution? Because the ck_real / vk_real are supposed to be the coefficients / exponents of the real part of the correlation function (and the others the imaginary part), and if you plug in imaginary parameters, then terms that previously were only in the real parts could pick up imaginary parts etc. Perhaps this kind of thing cancels out when you add the two unphysical D-L baths to get the shifted D-L bath?. One can use the analytic expression for monomer absorption spectra to test which Drude-Lorentz bath is correct. Also, one can use [DM-HEOM](https://github.com/noma/dm-heom) [2], where they have implemented the ""Shifted Drude Lorentz Bath"" [1]. Compared with their Matsubara implementation, it gives the same density matrix evolution (up to the numerical accuracy) as QuTiP's HEOM gives with `DrudeLorentzBath` and $\gamma \rightarrow \gamma \pm \Omega$ and $\lambda \rightarrow \lambda/2$. But it is not the case for `DrudeLorentzPadeBath`. You are right to think that the unphysical part goes away when two baths are added [1], one with $+i\Omega$ and the other with $-i\Omega$. > However, I would want to be very sure that in the case where the parameters are all real, the results are not affected by the change. Is that so? Only asking because that is not clear to me at first glance. You are very much in the right to be absolutely sure before making a change. As far as I understand and have tested, it will not change the real case because the changes are as follows (I have removed all the other lines in between for clarity):. ```python; - ck_real = [np.real(eta) for eta in eta_p]; + ck_real = [eta for eta in eta_p]. - ck_imag = [np.imag(eta_p[0])]; + ck_imag = [-lam*gamma]. - eta_p = [lam * gamma * (self._cot(gamma * beta / 2.0) - 1.0j)]; + eta_p = [lam * gamma * (self._cot(gamma * beta / 2",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2520#issuecomment-2358685274:666,test,test,666,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2520#issuecomment-2358685274,1,['test'],['test']

The only difference with your approach is that I did not include a try expect for import of iPython because the relevant change for the print_figure function was done 8 years ago. Besides, there is also the issue that currently our tests workflows do not install ipython so `repr` in your tests will not call `_repr_svg_`.

Testability,"Thanks @jakelishman.

A technical issue here is QuTiP mostly has function based API. This presents lots of problems when you want to re-use objects, e.g., in this displace function. I had proposed to slowly move to classes, eg., Solver class (https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/962). A possible implementation here would be making a fresh `Displace` class in `qutip.operators` which would work like this:. ```; import numpy as np. from qutip.operators import Displace, displace. N = 32; alpha = 1 + 1j. d = Displace(N=32); d_new = d(alpha); d_old = displace(N, alpha). assert (np.allclose(d_new.full() == d_old.full()); ```. @qutip/core-workers What do you think about making some class based operators?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1293#issuecomment-646612460:833,assert,assert,833,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1293#issuecomment-646612460,1,['assert'],['assert']

Testability,Thanks Chris. This is looking good. I'll try it out in more detail in the comings days. Some immediate comments:; - I don't think we should keep two code-paths for parsing the config file. So either we keep using the old manual parsing or we make configobj the official and only way to parse the config file. In that case I think it would be Ok to simply fail to parse the config file if configobj is not available. I don't think many users use the config file so would be to worried about breaking backwards compatibility with respect to this.; - I think I'd prefer to have the logging module called logging.py rather than _logging.py even though it is supposed to internal to qutip. ; - Please add a `__all__` list in logging.py; - Shouldn't configspec.ini be added to the setup.py file?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/248#issuecomment-61393881:579,log,logging,579,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/248#issuecomment-61393881,3,['log'],['logging']

Testability,"Thanks both @jakelishman and @hodgestar for your comments! I agree that I may be depending too much on the classes in `qutip.tests.core.data` to do the testing both in qutip-tensorflow and qutip-tensornetwork. I myself was worried of ""who is going to tests the tests"" if this trend continued with other packages. Reusing the `qutip.tests.core.data`'s code though helps to speed things up in the development process and also allows QuTiP to strictly define what each specialisation is meant to do. . As you mentioned above, I think it would be best to create a `qutip.core.data.testing` module where all the classes for testing are implemented. Then these classes could be tested to ensure that the proper tests are created and these classes ca be used by both QuTiP and downstream packages. I do not have time for this now but I will come to this later, so lets keep this PR open to discuss any ideas!. ----. > the data layer tests should really discover the specialisations rather than us needing to specify them (this is true regardless of this PR). I am not sure about this one. Automatic discovery of tests for specialisations seems to lead to very restricted flexibility in how tests are parametrized. For instance, I needed to change the `rtol` to accommodate the tests for the complex64 data layer in qutip-tensorflow and I am not sure how this could be added automatically. . Also, as @hodgestar mentioned today, you probably want to be explicit on adding tests so that you are confident that those tests are running. Otherwise you need to constantly check the log to ensure the proper tests are running. . Another thing is that by being explicit on what is tested, you could assert if the tested specialisation has not been registered (which actually happened to both qutip-cupy and qutip-tensorflow before: specialisations where being tested but, surprisingly, they were not registered).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-981550356:125,test,tests,125,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-981550356,21,"['assert', 'log', 'test']","['assert', 'log', 'tested', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"Thanks for looking deeply into it. It's good to know the cause. We shouldn't remove support for SciPy 1.4 unless we _absolutely_ have to. Most users won't use matrices that large so won't be affected, and SciPy 1.5 is only a year old which is too recent to be a requirement in an academic setting. We should maintain at least a 2-year dependency window (like NumPy). Any constraints we make on allowable versions affect any packages downstream of us as well, so we want to try and stay as permissive as possible, as long as there's not new features that we absolutely must have. We already have mechanisms for working around an unstable `eigh` implementation because of problems with mac OpenBLAS `zheevr` in some cases, so we can add in this additional test when setting `eigh_unsafe` in our initialisation. The principle is that we decay to using the general-purpose `eig`, and include a specific orthonormalisation step to stabilise the eigensystem afterwards. This code is already in `qutip/sparse.py`, so it shouldn't be too hard to add an extra condition in `qutip/__init__.py`. Could you also test if the issue is also confined to MKL, or if it persists in OpenBLAS with SciPy 1.4 as well? We lose precision when swapping down to `eig` in place of `eigh`, so it's good to confine the switch to the minimum known-bad set.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1491#issuecomment-818719109:754,test,test,754,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1491#issuecomment-818719109,2,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Thanks for the quick response @bencbartlett. . Feel free to ignore the comments regarding the shortening of arguments. That was just a suggestion to make things shorter. But as you said clarity is more important. I will not change `waveguide` to `wg` and I think you should leave the others as they are if you can't think of shorter ones. Same applies to the `temporal_basis_vector`. I think you can even add a `temporal_basis` as you mentioned. Regarding the double line breaks wrapping top-level functions, I know the pep8 standard is two newlines but some other QuTiP modules follow just a single line break, e.g., [floquet](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/floquet.py). But again some other modules in QuTiP follow the pep8 standard and wrap two newlines for top-level functions. I am in favor of the pep8 standard and have two newlines. @ajgpitch what do you suggest?. Please remove the helper function `count_filled` without the test if it is not required. We aim to test as much as possible and remove redundancy in code. About `__all__`, I will shift all the rest in a new PR and we can keep yours as it is now.

I am also working on a new non-Markovian method which requires a class. Something of that sort is already used in `qutip.nonmarkov.heom`. I understand that many of qutip's solvers are written to be isolated functions but that should not mean that we should not write code to fully use the object oriented framework Python provides. Moreover, I noticed that you have to rewrite wrappers for the functions anyways to deal with repeatedly calculating things such as `scattering_probability` which clearly can be made much more compact if we use a class based approach.

Testability,"Thanks very much @Ericgig for preparing this!. I feel like it will be quite confusing if gates like `cnot` have different signatures than the ones in qutip-qip. Moreover, many of those gates/transformations are not only relevant to `qip`, but also used in other applications, so maybe we should keep more of them in the main qutip. One of the reasons that we want to include those gates into `qutip.operators` is because a few other downstream packages (e.g. `krylovsolver` that is now merged into qutip, and `qutip-tensornetwork` also uses Hadamard transform) also use them for testing (only) purposes. Having them in the main qutip may save them from depending on qutip-qip. I guess it would be better if we either; - Remove all qip and only define a few `_cnot`, `_swap` as private functions for testing inside the main qutip. And ask whoever else wants to use some gates to install `qutip-qip`. This may result in e.g. `qutip-tensornetwork` depending on `qutip-qip or having to implement a copy of some gates. or; - Include some more commonly used gates like `rx`, `ry` (they are unitaries generated by the Paulis and directly relevant to quantum control) `iswap` etc and keep them identical to the ones in qutip-qip, so that those who just want some gates for testing does not have to download the full qutip-qip. If the problem is the `qutip.qip.expand_operator`. I would argue that we can even include it into the main qutip. It is `tensor` + `permutation` and works not just for qubit systems, but also for other composite Hilbert spaces (provided a `dims`). It is quite handy not just for `qip`, but also for control and probably some other applications.

Testability,"Thanks victor!  My main worry as it stands is that, as I mentioned in the previous issue, this fix, on its own, introduces an unwanted additional error for the case with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, as then that time dependence essentially gets shifted twice, once by the H_shifted change, and once again by adding tlist[idx] to tau_list. ; This case of a time-dependent H could do with a test as well I guess. . This can be easily remedied by completely omitting the old method of shifting the time-dependence (e.g., using H and c_ops instead of H_shifted and c_ops_shifted in the call to mesolve(), for example).    But I am a little concerned that the the old method of shifting the time-dependence in H_shifted and C_ops_shifted was there for a reason.  @Ericgig any thoughts?.

Testability,"Thanks, Kevin. And sorry for being slow to review this. I'll certainly merge it soon. One small thing, could you change naming (most importantly in the exception you raise at some point, and also in naming of the unit tests, etc) from old-style to function-callback style, which is how we usually refer to this td-format. I don't like the ""old-style format"" because it suggests that it is deprecated or inferior or has been replaced. Both function-callback and the list-string format for cython are fully supported methods and have their own distinct use-cases. While the cython format is faster, it is rather limited in what it can do, and sometimes the flexibility of the function-callback format is called form. Also, I wonder if you're method could not also be applied to `_correlation_me_2op_2t` ?

If you are just interested in the Liouvillian gap only, that should be fine. . Another faster and more stable technique that can be used in the case that only local dissipation processes are present (while the Hamiltonian is long range), is that of calculating the ""antigap"": since an additional weak PT symmetry is present, the symmetry of the Liouvillian spectrum in the complex plane can be exploited by just calculating the two largest eigenvalues. More details about this method, also benchmarking the validity of the Liouvillian gap calculated from a PIQS object, can be found here https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07570. .

Testability,"The original purpose behind the files was to aid debugging, firstly of the library, then of implementations. Now it turns out that some of the 'test out files' are useful in terms of analysis, e.g. the iteration log, and so I generally have this turned on. Often the optimisation can take a long time, and hence having the files written out during the process can be useful to monitor progress. Also, sometimes the processing is terminated early (by the scheduler on the cluster we use), and so having some filesystem output can mean that some kind of result can be extracted. All this being said, I can see your point that some kind of 'run data' container object would be a better method, as the data could be used interactively.

Testability,"There is one particular setup where the sparse eigen solver segfault. This happen with pure scipy and is not related to qutip.; Looking into it, I saw that when we installed qutip, it updated scipy version. It downgraded scipy 1.12 to 1.11, thus we never tested for 1.12.; Also build isolation meant that the version of numpy, scipy and cython we set in our test matrix did not match the one at installation. This is not ideal for cython since the compilation version could have a major impact. I set it to not use build isolation and used the matrix set version to compile qutip.; This had the side effect of not using the setup that caused the segfault and solving the failing test issue.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2361#issuecomment-2019207660:255,test,tested,255,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2361#issuecomment-2019207660,3,['test'],"['test', 'tested']"

Testability,"There's a distinction between `git` and GitHub here, in that PRs are purely a GitHub thing. As far as `git` is concerned, there's actually no problem at all with a PR being merged from `master` on somebody else's fork (`master` after all is an arbitrary label). The reason to do it is that the person who created the PR will find it harder to incorporate upstream changes, because their `master` will now always be out-of-sync from ours until they fetch from our `master` and do a `git reset --hard` onto it, which would delete their commits and force their branch to line up with ours again. From our side, it makes no difference except that the default commit message that Github gives us will say `Merge branch mlaguna10:master into qutip:master`. You can just change the message and no-one would ever know from looking at the `git log`. I think this is all Boxi meant - it's no issue on our side. If you do the funky two-PR merge/rebase that Alex and I were talking about (by email) then it's all moot anyway, because all commits from this PR and #1212 will get squashed together and GitHub won't know that the PRs were actually merged (the author contributions will count, but I think the PRs will have to be manually closed).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1209#issuecomment-606714637:835,log,log,835,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1209#issuecomment-606714637,1,['log'],['log']

Testability,This is ready to be reviewed and added to QuTiP. Notebooks are in : https://github.com/nathanshammah/piqs/blob/master/notebooks/notebook_piqs.ipynb. One would need to change the import statement to `from qutip.models.dicke import *`. Perhaps some more testing could be done for the states and operators but I want to get this merged first before trying to optimize. The Liouvillian created here works with QuTiP's solver (thanks to Neill's suggestion). Thus one can easily work with ensembles of spins or even ensembles coupled to bosonic cavities and take full advantage of QuTiP machinery. We have an optimized solver for diagonal Hamiltonians which is faster and perhaps there is a scope to make this even faster with the correct RHS calculation.

Testability,"This isn't quite ready for a PR (not tested, missing documentation, etc.), but should show the general scope of what I am planning on. I went with the convention of naming new functions something along the lines of `rand_dm_ginibre` to differentiate from existing functions like `rand_dm`. Does this make sense, or is there another API design that would work better?

Testability,"This issue has a two-fold interest: decreasing test time in general and expand the platforms through which QuTiP is available. . What is the reason it takes so long on Nix? QuTiP, in the [latest PR](https://travis-ci.org/qutip/qutip/builds/628865624?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification), takes on average 20 minutes to run its tests on a given platform. Much of this I think is due to the Cython configurations, indeed the no-cython option takes only 13 minutes. My first suggestion would be to try without Cython if things speed up, from those requirements (@Ericgig set that up and I am not knowledgeable about it). . From your PR on `nixpkgs` do you build on Travis CI or a similar cloud? If you could give a list of time taken by the different tests that would help. . The idea of a subset of tests is interesting (essential tests vs. thorough tests), in general; for example thorough tests could be done only in production and a lighter version could be called with `qutip.testing.run()`. Although, in specific, it is not clear to me how to triage which tests to skip. I would be glad to have the others opinion on this too (pinged them as assignees).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1147#issuecomment-569696700:47,test,test,47,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1147#issuecomment-569696700,9,['test'],"['test', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"Update Travis build passes. ### Summary . This PR helps convert between superop reps with non-square shape. This is needed because quantum channels can have input and output spaces of different dimension. It works between super, choi, kraus. It correctly handles tensor product structures and systems with different dimensions e.g. a qubit and a qutrit. . It does not work for Chi rep or the Steinspring rep. In the Chi rep only the qubit Pauli basis has been implemented. One would need to first get the Chi rep working for Qudits. At the moment it is unclear how to generalize to the Stinespring rep. . **changes**; - in `type_from_dims` the flag `enforce_square` was set to `False`. This helps in the conversion.; - in `qobj`, `__mul__` was extended to allow construction of non square operators from an outer product using the suggestion of @Ericgig ; - `_super_tofrom_choi`, `choi_to_kraus`, `kraus_to_choi` have been changed so they work with non-square shapes.; - to support the above changes `vector_to_operator` and `vec2mat` were changed to allow for non square shapes. **other changes**; - `Qobj permute`. `tidyup` was removed from to resolve a failing test at the suggestion of @nonhermitian ; - `choi_to_kraus` and `to_kraus`. When converting from Choi to to Kraus there are many small norm Kraus operators. A `tol` parameter was added to help remove these spurious operators. ### Added Tests; **test_superoperator_reps**; - Convert non-square Kraus operator to Super + Choi matrix and back.; - Neglect tiny Kraus operators when converting Choi to Kraus. **test_superoper**; - Operator - vector - operator conversion with a tensor product state.; - Operator - vector - operator conversion for non-square matrix. **test_qobj**; - bra and ket multiplication with different dims e.g. [N, 1] and [1, M] for M \neq N",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1098#issuecomment-576981021:1164,test,test,1164,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1098#issuecomment-576981021,2,"['Test', 'test']","['Tests', 'test']"

I'm also not surprised you're not able to reproduce this on your machine on Linux: this is definitely a platform-dependent problem. The issue is that QuTiP's use of Cython is *extremely* brittle. This makes contributing to the library quite difficult. Until the most recent release (4.4.1), these kinds of problems were also affecting me and colleagues a lot as a user, but luckily that seems to have gotten better. Nonetheless, it would be great if QuTiP's low-level parts became even more robust.

Testability,"Well, the default implementation for states is actually nearly completely unchanged (the only difference is that I replaced `np.fliplr(array)` with `array[::-1]`, which I think is a more readable idiom for ""backwards""). You're right that in the new form, basically the method is that you cache various parts of the `np.polyval` call into a 3D tensor, rather than recomputing this large polynomial each time. The `np.polyval` call is how you actually go from an array of different values of `alpha` (which comes from the meshgrid) to the coherent state, but doing it with `polyval` means you construct the coherent state and do the dot product simultaneously to save memory. If you need to repeat the calculations a bunch, and you've got enough memory to spare, you can build up all the `alpha**n / sqrt(factorial(n))` tensor once, then just dot it against every state. Since we're dealing with _complex_ Hilbert spaces, the inner product isn't a straight dot product, it needs the conjugate of one of the sides, so we only store the conjugate of the alpha tensor. You can see in the timings that this isn't _always_ the biggest win you'd expect; in some cases, the additional memory usage causes you to be more heavily bound by memory bandwidth issues rather than CPU pipelined stuff, which is another reason we allow forcing either method to be used. If you're interested in the most readable implementation, you might want to look at the test:; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/a20c26307e2f6e738f87efd75abafc3dff4daad5/qutip/tests/test_wigner.py#L251-L260",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1583#issuecomment-877254212:1440,test,test,1440,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1583#issuecomment-877254212,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"Without seeing the code it is difficult to be sure exactly what this problem was. Python's garbage collection should have been aggressively pruning the stored objects once they were no longer referenced, and I'm not aware of any other people reporting memory usage problems in `mesolve`, but it's possible there was a reference being kept to a dense Liouvillian at every time step at some point in the past (the Liouvillian would explain the N^4 usage, as opposed to a dm which should be just N^2). I'm fairly sure this isn't a problem any more at least; I was able to run the test script; ```python; import qutip; import numpy as np; N = 500; L = [[qutip.liouvillian(qutip.rand_herm(N)), '1']]; rho = qutip.rand_dm(N); times = np.linspace(0, 1, 101); e_op = qutip.jmat((N - 1)/2, 'x'); qutip.mesolve(L, rho, times, e_ops=[e_op]); ```; on a fairly non-descript Macbook without issue as of a `master` shortly (hopefully) before the 4.6 release, without ever exceeding 3GB of RAM used.

Testability,"Without the black changes, the patch would have applied cleanly, I think.

Here's a blog post they made about them, and some of the problems: https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/stop-foxtrots-now/. *Edit*: I usually wouldn't care about this, and we'd just squash the PR into a single commit to avoid all these problems, but in this particular case, the PR is kind of like two logical things at once.

Testability,"Yeah, `qutip-qip` is a much easier build and installation process because you don't need to be concerned about compiler infrastructure, ABI compatibility or stuff like that. In addition in that particular test run, there were three individual calls to change the installed packages, which meant plenty of space for stuff to go wrong. In this case, I think it was a strange interaction between the old `.travis.yml` specifically installing `numpy` and all other dependencies from `conda-forge`, without the channel being in the defaults list. Since `conda uninstall` doesn't specify an additional channel, the dependency calculator considers `defaults` to be higher priority, so it sets various packages to arbitrary allowed ones from `defaults`, which with `openblas` installed like this meant numpy `1.14`. That's my guess at least - it's a pretty weird set up circumstances, but the new `.travis.yml` file that's already in `master` is far simpler about the build process.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1448#issuecomment-782177609:205,test,test,205,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1448#issuecomment-782177609,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"Yeah, auto-tidyup should be a function of CSR matrices only. It doesn't make sense for dense matrices to have it, that's just burning cycles. As Asier mentioned, you already can't rely on floating-point operations being exactly identical between different matrix types, so there's no particular problem there. The point about auto-differentiation is an excellent reason that it must be allowed to vary between types as well. To be honest, I'm not sure how many cases the auto-tidyup operation actually helps in keeping things efficient. It may well be worth us having a proper investigation, and seeing how often it actually helps. I can tweak the addition and matrix-multiplication sparse algorithms to automatically tidy up when generating their output (if they don't already...), in which case we could probably entirely remove all ""automatic"" tidyup, and just have it be a manual operation?. `isherm_csr_full` is actually explicitly meant to handle all cases, _especially_ those involving matrices that have not been tidied up. The logic is actually sound (it's been deployed in `master` for a while now), but looks like there's a typo made when I handled the merge up, and the data-layer is missing a few of its mathematical tests so it didn't get spotted. I'll fix that now.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1610#issuecomment-882040752:1036,log,logic,1036,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1610#issuecomment-882040752,2,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'tests']"
Testability,"Yeah, definitely there's no point running tests that aren't really testing the package properly. I would hope that if we're much more aggressive about converting time-dependent lists into QobjEvo objects inside `mesolve`, `mcsolve` and `sesolve` (or the class-based versions of them), we could significantly reduce the amount of testing that needs to be done with them. Most of the tests of time-dependent formats would then occur in the QobjEvo tests. We could still test all the configurations of the solvers without too heavy a time penalty. If we only use a small number of different time-dependent operators, we can compile them all only once, and have `pytest` manage the resources through shared fixtures. That would really cut down the run times, especially for the current ""slow"" tests. Another avenue for cutting down run time is if we could merge say the MKL and OpenMP tests into one Travis job - the setup time for one job is about 2.5 minutes, and that's before any tests have run at all. I would hazard a guess that having MKL but not OpenMP is a pretty rare case (maybe more common on high-performance clusters where people submit single-cpu jobs?).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1217#issuecomment-604348182:42,test,tests,42,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1217#issuecomment-604348182,9,['test'],"['test', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"Yeah, on the practical side I was using those states to construct collapse operators, and then using these in steadystate() for a large range of parameters. Bit surprised to see what took 20 minutes in 4.7 took >5 hours in in v5 :0 I guess this is a combo of Liouvillian construction taking much longer as it then converts the Hamiltonian to Dense as well, and steady-state solving taking a bit longer too. Of course I can manually make those operators sparse (and then v5 just takes 7 mins!), but more generally, I think the logic of default_dtype is nice; essentially allows you to run QuTiP in that 'mode'. Also useful for cases like making jax objects, etc. ; I have another case where I actually want all operators to be dense, as I use .expm() a lot. . I think most functions in operators.py and states.py follow this logic, e.g., `basis()` in states.py: `dtype = dtype or settings.core[""default_dtype""] or _data.Dense`. I think it seems to make sense to apply it universally, irrespective of whether a particular object is naturally of one type or another, to avoid the cost of conversion when doing lots of repetitive things, avoid accidentally getting or making a particular type when you expect something different from default_dtype, etc. edit: Just to add, your suggestion of having two different default_dtypes could be nice too.

Testability,"Yeah, this is just one of those silly things caused by ImageMagick choosing a _very_ generic name and then getting burned (hence the swap to `magick`...). Probably the best thing to do is to try and run `convert` once at discovery and to see what happens.

If so, try this patch: [check_convert.txt](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/files/4397692/check_convert.txt). It rearranged the functions a little for a more logical order (I'll rebase the PR before merge), but the main change is that it now tests the output of `convert -version` to see if it contains the substring `imagemagick` (case insensitive). The reason to do this now is because if we allowed the error to propagate later, we'd have to check it every time and it would mean we'd have to pass through the ""special cases"" more frequently, and it would make the core logic more complex.

They are not that trivial to implement like the rest of the gates and are also not limited to just `qip`. Keep them consistent with other functions that generate Qobj (support `dtype`).; - Remove all rest of the gates and create some private substitutions just for testing. We should probably add somewhere in the changelog for the major release that if users are using gates like `cnot` for testing and now cannot find it.

Testability,"Yes, there are some cases where the dense operation is much faster. But there will be others (larger H space) where the sparse routine is faster. And it's not really fair to compare when you don't include the preops in the timeit. It's difficult, but not impossible, for us to tell in the code which situation we are in when make a superop vector multiplication. If we add lots of checks in, then this will slow things too. I think this is similar to #818. If we are going to address this, that is use dense matrix algebra for small systems, then we need to do it comprehensively. As is outlined in #437. I don't think we should make small changes in individual functions, this could make a big mess. I am putting a proposal together for a funding application. I have included work to something like #437. Maybe I will have time before also. You could maybe do something in your HEOM work where you have a `dense_oper` attribute, in which case you use numpy dense operations.

Testability,"You could try restarting them if you like, but it's been an issue hitting a few PRs now - I've had random test failures on two or three commits in #1181, now here, and I think one of your recent ones did too?. The oddest thing is that I can't reproduce the failures on my machine at all, so it's difficult to find out what's going on. I may try and make a fake PR which disables all but the nocython tests to see if I can pin it down (or if Eric knows). I ran the tests like 30 times back to back and no failure.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1221#issuecomment-607082956:106,test,test,106,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1221#issuecomment-607082956,3,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"
Testability,"You do as you wish, but I much prefer when you submit things via pull requests rather than pushing directly to master, because it gives an opportunity to give feedback or at least being aware of what is happening before it lands in master.

Testability,"You simple need to create a function starting with `test_` that use the progress bar. Ideally you would use it in a way that ensure all lines of code are used at least once.

Testability,"_**edit to put the positivity up top!**_: This is a very exciting prospect to me, and I'm always happy when other libraries want to interact with QuTiP! In the interests of inciting more discussion, I've got thrown in some more discussion points below - I'm 100% sure they're all solvable, but it also seems like there isn't one way that's unambiguously correct to do them, so they're worth discussing. ---. In principle I'm happy to implement this, though I don't really agree with your assertion that `othertype.toqobj()` is bad style! It might be so in Julia, but Python doesn't have all the same multiple-dispatch niceties that Julia has, so at the end of the day, we have to add in a method with a ""magic"" name somewhere, and it all just comes down to choosing the name of the method. The downside to having a magic name is that it means we have to eschew proper namespacing; what if another library one day wants to call their interface the same thing? Then it's completely impossible for a downstream library to interoperate with both. Having conversions be a non-special method of the downstream class, and leaving our constructor unaware of them alleviates that issue. Numpy can get away with squatting the `__array__` name because they're _huge_, but I would argue that if we do it, we could actually _harm_ the quantum software ecosystem in the long-run - what happens when a package better than QuTiP comes along that wants to call its objects `Qobj` as well? Let's face it - it's a pretty straightforward name!. All that said, I am very aware that not everyone agrees with me on this, and I _am_ a big fan of interfaces. Python doesn't give us the tools to do it properly, but we can emulate it, like you suggest. I have a few more considerations to add to a discussion:. 1. we can't have _proper_ namespacing, but let's at least make the magic name `__qutip_qobj__` so we realistically prevent any chance of a clash - by nature of a centralised package manager, we can be sure that no ot",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507:488,assert,assertion,488,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507,1,['assert'],['assertion']

Testability,"`Qobj` has some fast-path constructors that are basically the solvers saying ""this data is valid, just trust me"", causing it to skip sanity checks. There are a few slow points that can be skipped: copying unnecessary data, parsing/verifying the `dims` data, and determining the properties (`isherm`, `iscp`, etc). All of those add on very non-negligible construction time, but at most points in QuTiP we _know_ the values when passing them. Old-style code uses these magic ""fast-path"" constructors, but the new 5.0 branch gets rid of all of them - you can achieve much more, and more explicitly, by using the kwargs, and function-specific logic stays at the call location, rather than being bolted into `Qobj`. We still want to maintain passing `isherm` to `Qobj` when we know it for speed reasons, especially when we know the most common use of the `Qobj` created by `mesolve` is for finding expectation values. However, you can set the value based on the hermicity of the input density matrix; if you're passed a true density matrix, you'll always get a Hermitian matrix out, whereas you'll generally be in an unknown state if you're not. The test can be; ```python; def mesolve(H, rho0, tlist, ...):; hermicity = rho0.isherm or None; ...; for t in tlist:; output.states.append(Qobj(fdata, dims=dims, isherm=hermicity)); ```; which forces `isherm=True` if that's _known_, but leaves it unset if not. This is approximately how we handle things in 5.0, which is in part why we have huge reductions in `Qobj` construction time in the new version.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1460#issuecomment-796689049:639,log,logic,639,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1460#issuecomment-796689049,2,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'test']"
Testability,"`__array_wrap__` for coercion back (something that isn't currently implemented). At the time and up to inclusively 1.19, the presence of `__array__` caused otherwise scalar types passed alone to `np.array` to return the output of `input.__array__(*args, **kwargs)`, instead of becoming a 0D numpy array (like `np.array(1)` does). Taken purely alone, that could make sense as something we implement. However, this also implies that `Qobj` should fulfil the numpy ufunc interface; `Qobj` would be a container for data such that operations like `np.sin` is the elementwise sin, or (most notably) `np.multiply` is the *elementwise* multiplication. Our `Qobj` _does not_ fulfil the ufunc interface:; 1. elementwise operations don't make sense on quantum objects, which are arrays only as an implementation detail - the `Qobj` class is meant to represent an abstract linear algebra object, not specifically a matrix.; 2. we don't honour the `shape` guarantees of numpy as we test compatibility based on `dims`, which are not 1D (superoperators) so cannot follow numpy's broadcasting rules; 3. we treat multiplication as matrix multiplication, violating how `np.multiply` should behave. My main concern is point 1: I don't think that `Qobj` provides a similar object to an `ndarray` at all. Right now we _do_ use matrices underneath, but proposed additions to QuTiP such as symbolic `Qobj` and adaptive Hilbert spaces are compatible with the idea of ""abstract linear algebra objects"", but do not necessarily have a backing array. Point 2 is mostly an extension of that: I'm not sure there is a sensible way for numpy's broadcasting rules to be applied to quantum objects as they exist now, even without extensions. ## More control over dispatch: `__array_ufunc__` and `__array_function__`. See [NEP 13](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0013-ufunc-overrides.html), [NEP 18](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0018-array-function-protocol.html) and [NEP 35](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0035-array-creation-dispatch-with-arra",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1433#issuecomment-772608902:4420,test,test,4420,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1433#issuecomment-772608902,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"`auto-tidyup` exist to remove 0s stored in sparse matrices. `auto-tidyup` is quite messy, rounding all values under 1e-12 to 0 per default after each matrix operation can only cause problems. . As for the benchmark, why ask for dense operations to add an extra step to increase their outputs error to the same level as sparse operations so their benchmark do not look to good in comparisons. I think it is fair that the sparse operation's timing include the time needed to manage it's structure. . For auto-differentiation, if operations included are done with `Qobj`, it would have to differentiate tidy-up steps after each operation. But since the tidy-up operation does not have a clean derivative (`out[out < 1e-12] = 0`) it will make the auto-differentiation very inefficient. I see `auto-tidyup` more as a necessary evil to keep sparse matrix efficient. I would argue that we should not have `auto-tidyup` in `Qobj` and have sparse matrix operation clean themselves instead.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1610#issuecomment-881709826:205,benchmark,benchmark,205,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1610#issuecomment-881709826,2,['benchmark'],['benchmark']

Testability,"`scipy` 1.5 has changed some of its private attributes for matrix multiplication (to a _much_ better name!), and so matrix-matrix multiplication is completely broken for us at the moment: see scipy/scipy@53fac7a. There's also been some changes to how Hermitian eigenvalues and vectors are calculated (which actually is good news for us in general), which may has a bit of a knock-on for some of the `zheevr` tests, which is going to be a bit of a nuisance to fix. To avoid polluting this PR with (any more) off-topic discussion, I've opened #1299. The new data layer types will fix the matrix multiplication issue permanently, because we'll not be duplicating/reusing large tracts of `scipy` private code - we have our own Cython versions that operate faster on more optimised types.

Testability,"ate this overhead (like the `mesolve_prepare_ode(H, state, c_ops) -> OdeState` that you propose in https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-859917462). On the other hand, looping over the full `mesolve` as in `In [19]` obviously has no problems with parallelization. I wasn't sure if that's what you meant by ""`mesolve` is re-entrant"" or whether recent changes in QuTiP now use a re-entrant internal integrator, i.e. not `scipy.integrate.ode`. At the time I implemented the [`DensityMatrixODEPropagator`](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/propagators.py#L162) by looking at what `mesolve` was doing at a low level for the specific case of density matrices, `scipy.integrate.ode` was definitely being used, and that couldn't handle propagating in parallel (and by ""parallel"" I include alternating propagation steps from two different propagations). I'm also not sure what using `QobjEvo` does: In the benchmarking, there didn't seem to be any difference whether I wrap my nested lists into `QobjEvo` or not. Is there something specific that `QobjEvo` should enable that I can't do with nested lists?. > QuTiP 5 is (probably) going to formalise that (^) sort of low-level calling convention of `mesolve`, but it should work already. The new one look a bit different because instead of doing the setup very manually, there'll be a ""low-level"" function to prepare a master equation problem (and a Schrodinger equation one, etc), and then there'll be a `step` method instead of calling the ""high-level"" interface function `mesolve`, but functionally it'll do largely the same, just with a lot less data copying than the current form has to do. In the new system, it's likely that the function `mesolve` itself will keep the exact same interface it has now, just internally most of its processing will be split into modular components, each of which will be accessible (with different names) to the user to compose themselves, if the",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-860254243:7600,benchmark,benchmarking,7600,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-860254243,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarking']

Testability,"cially with quite how many names `qutip` exports. The `from qutip.very.deep.nested.module import name` is certainly good, and I think I've generally left those. I think I started converting in a few places because there were things like `from qutip import Cubic_Spline` and `from scipy.interpolate import CubicSpline`, and then the test was unreadable as to which was which. Having `qutip.Cubic_Spline` and `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline` is unambiguous. The smaller cases like `from qutip import Qobj` are highly unlikely to have any conflicts, but in general I just went for consistency. That all said, there's certainly arguments both ways, e.g. explicit `qutip.member` is good because it's clearly explicit at point of use which makes reading the code much easier, but bad because it adds unnecessary chaff which makes scanning lines take longer. I hadn't put much thought into it before, and I think I was just generally writing in my default style. #### Test ordering; I hadn't much considered this, but there are certainly ways of doing it. Essentially `pytest` goes through a few stages when you run `pytest` on the command line: discovery, generation, running, reporting, and it has lots of hook functions we can define to modify the state inbetween and during each of them. Default discovery is as you say: files in alphabetic order (I _think_ it's strictly shell globbing order, but generally that's alphabetical), then the contents of each file in order defined by the shared fixtures used. We tend not to need large amounts of state to be held in fixtures, so our files largely just run top-to-bottom. We can add in some logic into the collection-time hooks to re-order the tests. There's a `pytest` plugin called [`pytest-ordering`](https://github.com/ftobia/pytest-ordering), but it looks like it's not really actively maintained any more and the logic is pretty straightforwards, so perhaps not a terrible idea just to do it ourselves.

Testability,"ct? Dictionary support was not tested and supported only for some solver for a long time. It ; > would be strange to have it become the default. Well, this is v5 -- we are trying to make things nicer. The issue with lists of e_ops is that often the e_ops have no sensible ordering. E.g. if the e_ops are, say, the number operator and projectors on to two different bases of interest then `[qutip.num(N), proj1, proj2]` are later accessed as `.expect[0]`, `.expect[1]` and `.expect[2]` which are then unreadable and fairly arbitrary and unmemorable numbers. Having `.expect[""num""]`, `.expect[""proj1""]` and `.expect[""proj2""]` is much more readable and will result in fewer mistakes. I *really* like the dict interface because it gives this readability to results. I'm happy to accept that others may prefer lists, but providing multiple interfaces creates a problem for any code working with results. So it is a bit of tricky question to resolve. > For MC result, it has little impact, dict are a little more annoying to work with compared to list, but it need the expect as ndarray; not list or dict anyway. The MC result classes already have to work around these things in awkward ways, and probably need to be a lot more careful -- e.g. e_ops functions can return strange things like Qobjs or perhaps even stranger things like strings or dicts which can't be averaged over. > There are a some differences for the user. Code using `np.array(result.expect)` or `for expect in result.expect:` will break. Agreed, although unless `result.expect` contains a uniform set of things, this are probably not sensible things to be doing. I have some other ideas but I think they make more of a mess -- e.g. keep `.expect` a list but provide `.expect_d` which is a dict. If one needs to write v4 compatible code one can always pass a list of e_ops and then work with `.expect` a bit carefully (i.e. as a dict). Thoughts?. I have added tests now, so it's just the `.expect` issue to resolve for this PR, I think.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1907#issuecomment-1141326041:1959,test,tests,1959,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1907#issuecomment-1141326041,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"d_col)),; shape=(nds**2, nds**2),; dtype=np.complex128); ```; and recompile. If you want to make a PR of something similar against QuTiP, I'll accept it. I would actually file this against `scipy.sparse` - I think our usage is completely in line with the contract of `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` and they've got a bug in their dtype handling. You currently can't construct a CSR matrix using the COO triplet format for complex data, unless the dtype is made explicit _somewhere_, but the constructor is meant to correctly infer a suitable dtype if one is not passed. Basic Scipy reproducer to illustrate the problem:; ```python; >>> import scipy.sparse; >>> scipy.__version__; '1.6.1'; >>> scipy.sparse.csr_matrix(([1+1j], ([0], [0])), shape=(2, 2)); Traceback (most recent call last):; File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>; File ""/Users/jake/.anaconda3/envs/qutip-dev/lib/python3.8/site-packages/scipy/sparse/compressed.py"", line 54, in __init__; other = self.__class__(coo_matrix(arg1, shape=shape,; File ""/Users/jake/.anaconda3/envs/qutip-dev/lib/python3.8/site-packages/scipy/sparse/coo.py"", line 161, in __init__; self.data = np.array(obj, copy=copy, dtype=data_dtype); TypeError: can't convert complex to float; ```. This can be fixed either by passing `dtype=np.complex128` to the constructor, or passing the data inside a NumPy array, since that'll also fix the dtype. I imagine with their implicit conversions, SciPy may also need to test the special cases where all list elements are things like `1+0j`, which have type `complex` but can be safely represented by reals - the Python call `float(1 + 0j)` is forbidden even though the imaginary part is 0. I actually originally thought this was the problem in this issue, since all the Lindbladian data tested is real numbers with complex type. I suppose it's up to SciPy to decide how they want to handle that case - either always maintaining `complex` or putting in a special-case cast (`np.real(x)`) for known-safe complex -> float conversions.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1451#issuecomment-784265398:1770,test,test,1770,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1451#issuecomment-784265398,2,['test'],"['test', 'tested']"

Testability,"e fixtures at whatever level is appropriate. In this particular case, I scoped the `dimension` fixture at the module level, because there's loads of places that needed to test varying dimensions, and it's very convenient to define it just once. In the few cases where we needed to override that (e.g. in `dnorm`), I overrode it by providing a definition in a tighter scope - either at class level or per-function (via `pytest.mark.parametrize` directly). The correct scoping just depends a lot on the type of tests you're writing - if you're going to have to overwrite something constantly then module scoping isn't good, but if you have lots of different functions to test, and every test for a given function will want the same parametrisation, then class scoping might be a good choice. If you only need the parametrisation once, then it's best to put it right next to the place it's used (like in the case of mine that you've highlighted). It means that if you've opened that file to read the tests, then everything you need to understand `Test_fidelity.test_known_cases` will be on your screen if you just scroll to it. That makes it much easier for the next person who has to come along to edit your code. I used a couple of temporary variables in that case just to aid readability - my cases wouldn't have nicely fit on one line if I'd shoved the `qutip.basis(2, 0)` stuff inside the `pytest.param` constructors, and it would be hard to read. This way you can easily verify that the code is correct bit-by-bit; you can see clearly that the names are descriptive and match exactly what they say, and that means you can trust them when they then appear in the parametrisation. I won't pretend to be perfect at any part of coding, and particularly testing. I rewrote all the testing files starting from those beginning with ""a"" up to (now) ""metrics"" while I was first getting to know the QuTiP codebase, and hopefully you can see that my early efforts weren't that great, and they get a bit better",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1487#issuecomment-815044706:1204,test,tests,1204,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1487#issuecomment-815044706,1,['test'],['tests']
Testability,"e just dump out some information. ## Things you should know if you've not worked with segfaults before. - `Abort trap 6`, `Segmentation fault` and a few other points can all be from the same cause; - Segmentation faults are typically caused by reading or writing to memory that isn't owned by our process. These often occur by reading/writing too much data to an allocated pointer, or trying to read/write a memory location where the location was read from uninitialised memory.; - Segfaults will not always reliably occur. It's _very_ difficult to prove that swapping tools ""fixes"" a segfault; it can often just move around enough allocations to mask the problem, not fix it.; - Python stack traces are likely to be almost entirely unreliable in these cases, because the segfault may often occur while the garbage collector is running, and that will happen at seemingly non-deterministic times.; - Running files in a slightly different interpreter, running within a test runner with differing numbers of files, doing different work before and after will all cause the segfault to change, and may mask it.; - As annoying as they are, segfaults are actually the _good_ case of the bug - the worst is when we have invalid memory writes but _no_ segfault, because then we have memory corruption that's gone undetected. ## Thoughts about #1120. This issue is still present using Andrew's `Malloc.py` file as of the current master branch (commit 624405e7), and is in QuTiP 4.6.0 and most previous versions. I have been able to reproduce the segfaults with Python 3.7, but not Python 3.8, and I can reproduce it with all allowable values of `PYTHONMALLOC`. The most telling is `pymalloc_debug`, where the entire operation completes (it prints ""500""), and _then_ the fault occurs. This along with the error message should hopefully make it clear that an out-of-bounds write occurs occasionally, and it is temperamental where exactly this happens. This is typically not detected until the object is freed, wh",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1160#issuecomment-826124807:1248,test,test,1248,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1160#issuecomment-826124807,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"en module scoping isn't good, but if you have lots of different functions to test, and every test for a given function will want the same parametrisation, then class scoping might be a good choice. If you only need the parametrisation once, then it's best to put it right next to the place it's used (like in the case of mine that you've highlighted). It means that if you've opened that file to read the tests, then everything you need to understand `Test_fidelity.test_known_cases` will be on your screen if you just scroll to it. That makes it much easier for the next person who has to come along to edit your code. I used a couple of temporary variables in that case just to aid readability - my cases wouldn't have nicely fit on one line if I'd shoved the `qutip.basis(2, 0)` stuff inside the `pytest.param` constructors, and it would be hard to read. This way you can easily verify that the code is correct bit-by-bit; you can see clearly that the names are descriptive and match exactly what they say, and that means you can trust them when they then appear in the parametrisation. I won't pretend to be perfect at any part of coding, and particularly testing. I rewrote all the testing files starting from those beginning with ""a"" up to (now) ""metrics"" while I was first getting to know the QuTiP codebase, and hopefully you can see that my early efforts weren't that great, and they get a bit better and easier to read as time went on. (The later files haven't been converted yet.) The main things are to always be thinking about readability both of the code and the error messages that are coming out, and making sure that your tests are really testing that your functions have your behaviour you want them to have.

Testability,"er than a hard limit, but it's a good rule of thumb for testing one piece of functionality. [Here's a (slightly out-dated) list of our current longest tests](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1217#issuecomment-604116373), bearing in mind that some of those ones actually test many many things in the same test function. The test seems structured ok to me. Certainly the testing algorithm isn't the major cause of speed loss. You could try timing some ""real-world"" examples of using your measurements, and try running them in a profiler to see if there are any obvious ways to speed things up. With any luck the new data-layer tools and the possibility of using dense `Qobj` storage will give you a fair amount of speed-up once they're complete, since I imagine in your small circuit you're paying quite a lot of sparse matrix overhead. I'll prefix this last part with: _you should always profile your code before optimising it_. That said, let me wildly break that rule and guess at where I think you'll find big speed-ups: caching and pre-computation. If you know you're going to run the same thing loads and loads of times, then you shouldn't have to call `self.propagators` each time, or build `measurement_ops` inside `measure_comp_basis`. Do those once at the start of `run_statistics`, and save them. Minor things that _may_ speed up - check the profiling!; 1. ""compress"" the output of `self.propagators`: consecutive propagators with no measurements or classical controls inbetween can be pre-multiplied together at the start to make one matrix. This will save you ~3 matrix multiplications per run in the test.; 2. use more efficient ways to construct large tensor spaces: `qutip.basis`, `qutip.projection` and `qutip.qeye` can all directly constructor product spaces (e.g. `qutip.basis([2, 2, 2], [0, 1, 0])`). `tensor` is a comparatively expensive operation, and tensoring a list of elements internally is effectively `tensor(...(tensor(tensor(els[0], els[1]), els[2]), ...), els[-1])`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1274#issuecomment-640127213:1669,test,test,1669,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1274#issuecomment-640127213,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"es occur. In the meantime, I'll generally share some (what I _think_ is) relevant experience in the context of handling randomness in tests:; - My understanding is that we're talking about not testing the behaviour of random-number generations per se, but how the numbers they generate affect the non-deterministic functions/algorithms, which depend on the former. In such cases, I've either used a fixed seed (as you've mentioned in your [original post](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issue-619006856)), which can get a bit messy, as there's Python's `random`, NumPy's `random` (which also comes in a legacy and a modern flavour, namely `numpy.random.RandomState` and `numpy.random.Generator`). Also, as you've mentioned, there's tight coupling between the implementation logic and the corresponding set of tests, and updates in the former require constant maintenance of the latter.; - As an alternative, I've sometimes resorted to [`mock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html)ing the random-number generation process itself, and - in a way equivalent to using a fixed seed - providing a pre-defined sequence of numbers to the functions which depend on those. It comes with the same disadvantage of relatively tight coupling, but is somehow more flexible and powerful than just setting the seeds.; - I have used Hypothesis in the past (on a relatively small-scale project), and it's indeed a great framework with a lot of interesting and nice functionalities. I like it very much, but one disadvantage I ran into was the increased overall time for completion of a test run. In my case, a viable approach, for instance, was to run my Hypothesis tests (which were a subset of all tests) with a bit larger periodicity (in the CI pipeline) than the regular tests. Another concern that I intuitively have (I may be _wildly_ wrong on this one, though, not having yet properly explored QuTiP's testing landscape) is that - depending on how some Hypothesis tests are set up - th",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-1123679707:1831,mock,mock,1831,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-1123679707,1,['mock'],['mock']

Testability,"icit `qutip.member` is good because it's clearly explicit at point of use which makes reading the code much easier, but bad because it adds unnecessary chaff which makes scanning lines take longer. I hadn't put much thought into it before, and I think I was just generally writing in my default style. #### Test ordering; I hadn't much considered this, but there are certainly ways of doing it. Essentially `pytest` goes through a few stages when you run `pytest` on the command line: discovery, generation, running, reporting, and it has lots of hook functions we can define to modify the state inbetween and during each of them. Default discovery is as you say: files in alphabetic order (I _think_ it's strictly shell globbing order, but generally that's alphabetical), then the contents of each file in order defined by the shared fixtures used. We tend not to need large amounts of state to be held in fixtures, so our files largely just run top-to-bottom. We can add in some logic into the collection-time hooks to re-order the tests. There's a `pytest` plugin called [`pytest-ordering`](https://github.com/ftobia/pytest-ordering), but it looks like it's not really actively maintained any more and the logic is pretty straightforwards, so perhaps not a terrible idea just to do it ourselves. Maybe I'm not javascript enough to enjoy a good micro-dependency?. It would also be quite nice if we could define the whole logical structure of the `qutip` package, to help keep everything in order as the package grows larger. By that I generally just mean the internal structure, though cutting down the amount of global names exported could also be done in a sort of organisation like this: we could get a little more aggressive at not exporting things like `enr_*` or `three_level_*` to the global namespace, but instead put them in submodules. While I think this isn't what you were asking, it's also quite easy to just run specific parts of the testing suite if you're doing it from the command l",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-601793386:1846,log,logic,1846,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-601793386,2,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'tests']"

Testability,"ing clearer in the code - some of the earlier parametrizations I did were too aggressive because I wasn't used to the tools yet. The `test_control_pulseoptim` parts are very complex, in part because the underlying calling convention of that code is complex too. I'll try and add more comments to it to ease that along, especially in the part where I just defined a load of systems to test. That certainly should have been commented. There are general comments about what I was using the `pytest` tooling for in the commit messages, but I didn't necessarily want to leave ""intro to pytest"" comments throughout, because it would mostly crowd out the actual tests, and the `pytest` documentation online is probably going to be a better explanation than what I can do. I'm also learning `pytest` by doing this (I'd not used it before I opened the first PR)!. About the PRs: I'm happy with whatever workflow works best for you guys - I don't have any control over when the PR gets merged. It might be a little difficult for me to maintain two branches at once (i.e. if the first PR with ~10 tests is awaiting merging), because there's likely to be conflicts in `conftest.py` (in particular). Even if I branched the new PR off the previous one on the expectation that it would be merged, I'd have to keep adding merge commits into (or force-rebasing) the other branch to keep it up-to-date, which wouldn't be completely ideal in that it would make a bit of a mess in the git log. If you want to merge this one (after I've gone through and put some more comments in), I'm happy to start a new one. I can also start a new one on a new branch, I think it might just make a bit more of a mess than it solves. I think this one only got big because I had a good amount of free time at the same time as a `qutip` release happened, and most of the maintainers took a break for a few weeks. Right now I'm a bit busier with work so my conversion rate has slowed a little. I'll probably be back on it in a week or so.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-591413241:1339,test,tests,1339,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-591413241,2,"['log', 'test']","['log', 'tests']"
Testability,"ing it. Essentially `pytest` goes through a few stages when you run `pytest` on the command line: discovery, generation, running, reporting, and it has lots of hook functions we can define to modify the state inbetween and during each of them. Default discovery is as you say: files in alphabetic order (I _think_ it's strictly shell globbing order, but generally that's alphabetical), then the contents of each file in order defined by the shared fixtures used. We tend not to need large amounts of state to be held in fixtures, so our files largely just run top-to-bottom. We can add in some logic into the collection-time hooks to re-order the tests. There's a `pytest` plugin called [`pytest-ordering`](https://github.com/ftobia/pytest-ordering), but it looks like it's not really actively maintained any more and the logic is pretty straightforwards, so perhaps not a terrible idea just to do it ourselves. Maybe I'm not javascript enough to enjoy a good micro-dependency?. It would also be quite nice if we could define the whole logical structure of the `qutip` package, to help keep everything in order as the package grows larger. By that I generally just mean the internal structure, though cutting down the amount of global names exported could also be done in a sort of organisation like this: we could get a little more aggressive at not exporting things like `enr_*` or `three_level_*` to the global namespace, but instead put them in submodules. While I think this isn't what you were asking, it's also quite easy to just run specific parts of the testing suite if you're doing it from the command line. You can do `pytest file.py` to run only those in a specific file, or `pytest -m ""mark logic""` (e.g. `pytest -m ""not slow""`) to hit specifically marked tests. Perhaps most powerfully, and one I use a lot when writing these, you can do `pytest -k ""substring logic""` to run every test (potentially in the specified file(s)) that contains the elements specified in `""substring logic""`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-601793386:2288,log,logical,2288,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-601793386,7,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'logical', 'test', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"it of a larger restructure:; - rearrange the repo root to have `/src/qutip` and `/test/qutip` instead of `/qutip/tests` (I originally didn't like it, but I now see more and more benefits of the `/src` (or `/lib`) convention in Python projects).; - the current `qutip/tests` should entirely become `/test/qutip`; - a new `/src/qutip/test` becomes a fully-supported _public_ module, including base classes (such as the data-layer mixins) and things like that. We'd need to be careful, because reducing your possibilities for flexibility in testing generally sounds like a bad idea to me, but if we take care to be very limited, it could work. I suspect you won't be able to import the test suite from inside `qutip.core.data` because of cyclical dependencies, which is probably a good thing - it'll force us to put the structure the right way round immediately. For an idea pretty far out of left field:; - the data layer tests should really _discover_ the specialisations rather than us needing to specify them (this is true regardless of this PR); - if so, in the new form, we _could_ directly export this part of the test suite from `qutip.test` (our test suite would import this as well), and add a little bit of logic to allow filtering of which tests need to be run (class decorators, probably); - downstream packages could then test just by importing our classes and disabling any specialisations that are only on internal data-layer objects. I'm not 100% sure how I feel about this, but it's plausible - we'd still be able to add extra methods in our own test suite if we wanted them, because we could just derive from the classes, rather than defining the names into the test suite in those cases. ---. About us breaking downstream CI: having been a maintainer of QuTiP and now Qiskit, I have a deep-rooted hatred for any upstream package that forces CI failures on its dependents, because it _requires_ the lower packages to move ""fix CI"" way up to the top of their priority list; you can't m",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-979917075:1076,test,tests,1076,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-979917075,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

Testability,"ly by a sparse matrix, and instead it'll be a Fortran-ordered dense matrix, for which the stack/unstack is a free operation. That's an extremely exciting prospect! I'd love to be able to have internal sparse data for Qobj's that represent Hamiltonians/Liouvillians, but dense data for Qobj's that represent Hilbert space states or Density matrices. In fact, it looks like a significant part of the overhead in the [calculation of the Krotov's pulse update](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/optimize.py#L466) is due to the stacking/unstacking, see [`profile.svg`](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/goerz/34af142b78d7e344417d838bbea78aaf/raw/f3f49104083d59b9612f153d2f0ff652ea6a9f01/profile.svg) in the [gist](https://gist.github.com/goerz/34af142b78d7e344417d838bbea78aaf#file-profile-svg). In the benchmarking notebook, for the optimization in `In [34]`, that's the extra 6 seconds per iteration (iterations 1-3 should ideally take exactly twice as long as iteration 0, as iteration 0 is a simple forward propagation and all later iterations are one forward and one backward propagations). That's what we have in our Fortran implementation, too: the runtime of the optimization is basically just the runtime of all the internal propagations; calculating the updates should be completely negligible. There's also [shape conversions](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/propagators.py#L254-L260) happening in [`DensityMatrixODEPropagator`](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/propagators.py#L162) which would be nice to eliminate. Lastly, having dense internal storage for states might actually give the same speedup as we've demonstrated in https://qucontrol.github.io/krotov/v1.2.1/notebooks/09_example_numpy.html for doing Krotov with numpy arrays instead of Qobj's -- potentially even more speedup, in fact, since with nump",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-860254243:3870,benchmark,benchmarking,3870,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-860254243,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarking']

I opened a PR, also running the last blocks and qutip.about(), https://github.com/qutip/qutip-notebooks/pull/72. . * In [development-qobjevo-timing.ipynb](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-notebooks/blob/master/development/development-qobjevo-timing.ipynb), `Time for cte` could be more explanatory. Similarly elsewhere. * I wonder whether instead `QobjEvo`, `Qobjt` could be even more intuitive for the user. * I would really encourage you to write one notebook (or more), about the new functionalities of the stochastic solvers, as well as the old methods. This could be the to-go resource, beyond documentation, to understand how these stochastic solvers are now expanded and coherently defined. It does not need to be a lot of work, it can copy a lot of stuff from the development notebooks. It would be fundamental to have the solvers' master equations written down, explaining for each solver what each term is, e.g., the jump operator. Also, in `development-smesolve-tests`, the equations are already there for example. Block 23 is beautiful, and it could be reproduced in the tutorial. . * Similarly, a user guide entry would really enhance the adoption of these solvers. At a later stage, some more refined example applications could be provided. * Review is still ongoing, I will provide comments on the .py files and other solvers files. Help from other developers is welcome as these are massive changes.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/969#issuecomment-489565751:3682,test,tests,3682,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/969#issuecomment-489565751,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"n't put much thought into it before, and I think I was just generally writing in my default style. #### Test ordering; I hadn't much considered this, but there are certainly ways of doing it. Essentially `pytest` goes through a few stages when you run `pytest` on the command line: discovery, generation, running, reporting, and it has lots of hook functions we can define to modify the state inbetween and during each of them. Default discovery is as you say: files in alphabetic order (I _think_ it's strictly shell globbing order, but generally that's alphabetical), then the contents of each file in order defined by the shared fixtures used. We tend not to need large amounts of state to be held in fixtures, so our files largely just run top-to-bottom. We can add in some logic into the collection-time hooks to re-order the tests. There's a `pytest` plugin called [`pytest-ordering`](https://github.com/ftobia/pytest-ordering), but it looks like it's not really actively maintained any more and the logic is pretty straightforwards, so perhaps not a terrible idea just to do it ourselves. Maybe I'm not javascript enough to enjoy a good micro-dependency?. It would also be quite nice if we could define the whole logical structure of the `qutip` package, to help keep everything in order as the package grows larger. By that I generally just mean the internal structure, though cutting down the amount of global names exported could also be done in a sort of organisation like this: we could get a little more aggressive at not exporting things like `enr_*` or `three_level_*` to the global namespace, but instead put them in submodules. While I think this isn't what you were asking, it's also quite easy to just run specific parts of the testing suite if you're doing it from the command line. You can do `pytest file.py` to run only those in a specific file, or `pytest -m ""mark logic""` (e.g. `pytest -m ""not slow""`) to hit specifically marked tests. Perhaps most powerfully, and one I use a",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-601793386:2074,log,logic,2074,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-601793386,1,['log'],['logic']

Testability,"ngs regarding porting it directly into qutip, and we agreed it would be a good addition as a separate solver. There are a couple of we-believe-good reasons to provide <code>krylovsolve</code> as another qutip solver. As you mention, the method is currently limited to constant closed system Hamiltonians. Another possible addition discussed during the meetings was support for open quantum systems, which provides another unitary-fund grant opportunity for some students!. Another important application for many-body systems comes in handy with Krylov. Given the memory limitations from matrix representation of operators and the exponential growth of many-body systems Hilbert spaces, the limit of qubits on which the solvers live is around 15 qubits. This limitation gets expanded (in exchange for some slow down in the computations) to a few more qubits exploiting the binary operational nature of many-body systems. While any solver could use operations instead of matrices, it is a good testing bead to use Krylov's algorithm because of a property when constructing this space. This feature is a must-have within our research group, and everyone could also benefit from it. More importantly, Krylov is gaining increasing interest in the research community, and we believe that providing it as a qutip solver will increase the traffic of the repository. Regarding benchmarks and some documentation, we have a public jupyter notebook with some benchmarks here [krylov use examples](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f7ng8q9QNEzaZ97vGop3aIip8GPtl3GR?usp=sharing), and there's also a [medium blog post](https://medium.com/@julian.ruffinelli/krylov-approximation-method-for-quantum-evolution-148b3f023ec4) with some other details. As for maintenance, yes, the way this code-block fits in should not be problematic to update even with qutip changes. We use <code>krylovsolve</code> for research and will keep the solver repo outside qutip up to date and (hopefully!) inside of it for the communi",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1668#issuecomment-926236528:1112,test,testing,1112,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1668#issuecomment-926236528,1,['test'],['testing']

Testability,"regarding porting it directly into qutip, and we agreed it would be a good addition as a separate solver. There are a couple of we-believe-good reasons to provide <code>krylovsolve</code> as another qutip solver. As you mention, the method is currently limited to constant closed system Hamiltonians. Another possible addition discussed during the meetings was support for open quantum systems, which provides another unitary-fund grant opportunity for some students!. Another important application for many-body systems comes in handy with Krylov. Given the memory limitations from matrix representation of operators and the exponential growth of many-body systems Hilbert spaces, the limit of qubits on which the solvers live is around 15 qubits. This limitation gets expanded (in exchange for some slow down in the computations) to a few more qubits exploiting the binary operational nature of many-body systems. While any solver could use operations instead of matrices, it is a good testing bead to use Krylov's algorithm because of a property when constructing this space. This feature is a must-have within our research group, and everyone could also benefit from it. More importantly, Krylov is gaining increasing interest in the research community, and we believe that providing it as a qutip solver will increase the traffic of the repository. Regarding benchmarks and some documentation, we have a public jupyter notebook with some benchmarks here [krylov use examples](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f7ng8q9QNEzaZ97vGop3aIip8GPtl3GR?usp=sharing), and there's also a [medium blog post](https://medium.com/@julian.ruffinelli/krylov-approximation-method-for-quantum-evolution-148b3f023ec4) with some other details. As for maintenance, yes, the way this code-block fits in should not be problematic to update even with qutip changes. We use <code>krylovsolve</code> for research and will keep the solver repo outside qutip up to date and (hopefully!) inside of it for the community.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1668#issuecomment-926236528:1488,benchmark,benchmarks,1488,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1668#issuecomment-926236528,2,['benchmark'],['benchmarks']

Testability,"sis (`sigmaz()`, `num()` and so on all imply a particular basis). Beyond that, the ENR functions would attach some basis information onto their outputs to make them safe, and functions like `Qobj.transform` could take a required argument to name the new basis. . I'm certainly not considering this a priority, just a possible solution to the ENR problem and a couple of people had expressed interest in basis safety in the google group. We can always tack it on in a later release if it ever seems like a good idea in the future. #### Point 3. Yeah, this is absolutely all intended to be internal only. We wouldn't even print out this form in `Qobj.__repr__`, to my mind. You'd still type `dims=[[2], [1]]` to get a qubit ket and `dims=[[1], [2]]` for a qubit bra, so I don't think there's any confusion there. The reason there's not a special ""bra"" structure internally is because it's not necessary; a bra really is just a linear mapping from a particular vector space to the field, so having a special case for that makes more complex - the matmul compatibility test with `Map(Space, Field)` and `Map(Space, Space)` is the exact same test as for two operators, which simplifies the logic. ---. After sleeping on it, I still generally like the singleton pattern for this, but I think _completely_ relying on referential equality is probably a bit short-sighted. We can define, for example, `Space.__eq__` as; ```python; class Space:; def __eq__(self, other):; return (; self is other; or (; isinstance(other, Space); and self.size == other.size; and self.basis == other.basis; ); ); ```; so we'll almost invariably get the benefits right now, but we're rather more future-proof in the code. By analogy, it's clearly wrong to do `(1, 2) is (1, 2)` to compare tuples, even though `tuple` produces singletons in CPython (and that code will generally be `True`). The Python `tuple` class is basically what inspired me, and I'm 100% certain that the Python devs are smarter than I am, so we should probab",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1421#issuecomment-764870661:2921,test,test,2921,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1421#issuecomment-764870661,3,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'test']"

Testability,"sorption spectra to test which Drude-Lorentz bath is correct. Also, one can use [DM-HEOM](https://github.com/noma/dm-heom) [2], where they have implemented the ""Shifted Drude Lorentz Bath"" [1]. Compared with their Matsubara implementation, it gives the same density matrix evolution (up to the numerical accuracy) as QuTiP's HEOM gives with `DrudeLorentzBath` and $\gamma \rightarrow \gamma \pm \Omega$ and $\lambda \rightarrow \lambda/2$. But it is not the case for `DrudeLorentzPadeBath`. You are right to think that the unphysical part goes away when two baths are added [1], one with $+i\Omega$ and the other with $-i\Omega$. > However, I would want to be very sure that in the case where the parameters are all real, the results are not affected by the change. Is that so? Only asking because that is not clear to me at first glance. You are very much in the right to be absolutely sure before making a change. As far as I understand and have tested, it will not change the real case because the changes are as follows (I have removed all the other lines in between for clarity):. ```python; - ck_real = [np.real(eta) for eta in eta_p]; + ck_real = [eta for eta in eta_p]. - ck_imag = [np.imag(eta_p[0])]; + ck_imag = [-lam*gamma]. - eta_p = [lam * gamma * (self._cot(gamma * beta / 2.0) - 1.0j)]; + eta_p = [lam * gamma * (self._cot(gamma * beta / 2.0))]; ```; if `gamma` is real, `lam * gamma * self._cot(gamma * beta / 2.0)` would be real, and hence `ck_real` would stay the same as before, and the same can be said for `ck_imag`. After all, this is how it is done for `DrudeLorentzBath`, so it should not impact anything. > A more ""complete"" and probably more efficient solution would be to add a whole new ShiftedDrudeLorentzBath, and to put in analytically derived formulas for the Matsubara / Pade expansion coefficients. (As a first step, you could also calculate these coefficients manually and create a BosonicBath object from them directly.). This is what I have been using locally.

In any case, I'd strongly recommend performing a time-boxed experiment on a small subset of tests, which are more suited to property-based testing, and examining how that affects the test-run-completion time(s) and whether it introduces more failures than what would be desired/cost-efficient.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-1123679707:2428,test,test,2428,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-1123679707,9,['test'],"['test', 'test-run-completion', 'testing', 'tests']"

Testability,"t I've been working on. Beyond that, I've been working on adding a third system to this paper I'm; working on that describes FLiME. This third system should be able to show; changes based on the time_sense argument that aren't shown with the other; two systems, as those systems are so dominated by their primary frequency; that relaxing the secular approximation doesn't seem to change much in; terms of the results. The happy side effect is that I've had to fix some; issues with dimensionality that Eric mentioned, such that it ended up being; good bug testing for FLiMESolve as well. I'm hoping to have another pull request ready for review by the end of this; week or early next week, but I'm trying to really put everything under a; magnifying glass to the best of my ability, such that I don't leave Eric; wading through a bunch of formatting and code issues again.

Testability,"tate, time, e_ops); integrator = _mesolve_process_instructions(instructions, integrator); ```; and a call to `mesolve` would be like; ```python; solver = mesolve(H, rho0, times, c_ops); try:; result = next(solver); while True:; next_control = krotov.get_next_control(result.time, result.state); result = solver.send([; ('update-arguments', {'control': next_control}),; ('update-hamiltonian', ...),; ('add-c_op', ...),; # possible examples of API commands; ]); except StopIteration:; pass; ```; That's not super user friendly, but it _is_ nicely re-entrant. You'd have a single object you can copy and branch off, and QuTiP would be able to update the relevant objects for you at any given time. Still, I don't think it's a good strategy in general - we'd have to _very_ rigorously define the ""instructions"" API, and it would be pretty awkward to use. It would also be a nuisance for extensibility, probably; the intermediate state and instructions of `mesolve` would just more APIs we have to maintain and keep constant. Note that you can achieve the exact same thing with a callback function pattern here, except that control would never really pass back to the caller, so it would be impossible to (for example) branch execution part way through. The new, modular system we want to put into QuTiP 5 is an attempt to get the best of all these worlds. For users who don't need all this low-level behaviour, there'll still be the convenient `mesolve`, which just keeps working the same way it does now. For users (like you) who need more, we'll expose all the inner logic of the `mesolve` loop as separate components, so you'll still get all the nice set-up utilities if you want them, but you'll also then just be able to run the inner loop yourself. Since everything is modular, you'll have access to modify _everything_ that `mesolve` can access, so we won't need to define a specific, awkward API, and you can change it in whatever programming style you like, and is appropriate for your use case.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-859907481:3536,log,logic,3536,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-859907481,1,['log'],['logic']
Testability,"tbh, the only real use-case for `git cherry-pick` is to backport single bug-fix commits from `master` onto an already existing release branch without merging in additional feature commits. Since `dev.major` is intended to _include_ all of `master` (and `master` will eventually point to the `dev.major` tip), we shouldn't cherry pick from one to the other, but merge all changes. Having both #1289 and #1337 is effectively the same as having cherry-picked the feature onto both branches already, which is why the merge is now a bit tricky. That's not a problem at all (with how we developed it, it's the correct thing to do), it just means that when I joined them back together, I just merged this bit with the (logical - I did it all in one go) strategy `--ours` to tell `git` to keep the `dev.major` version.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1289#issuecomment-779258918:712,log,logical,712,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1289#issuecomment-779258918,1,['log'],['logical']

Testability,"thanks Dani, I think if you encode the problem in a more standard qutip structure the dependence on the small frequencies disappears;; ```; d = destroy(2).dag(); L_s = liouvillian(0*d.dag()*d, [np.sqrt(Gamma_l) *d, np.sqrt(Gamma_r) *d.dag()]); rho_ss = steadystate(L_s); I_s = Gamma_r * sprepost(d.dag(),d); current, noise, skw = third_cumulant(L_s, rhoss=rho_ss, J_ops=[I_s], I_ops=[I_s], sparse=True, method=""pinv""); ```. So I would prefer to revert the pseudo_inverse change (which is there originally to catch a different issue with the noise exploding). But nice example! this would make a great test I think. For the third_cumulant itself, maybe better to combine with the existing countstat_current_noise function, and provide the third cumulant, and support J_ops!=I_ops, as options?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2435#issuecomment-2134515607:601,test,test,601,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2435#issuecomment-2134515607,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"the quick response @bencbartlett. . Feel free to ignore the comments regarding the shortening of arguments. That was just a suggestion to make things shorter. But as you said clarity is more important. I will not change `waveguide` to `wg` and I think you should leave the others as they are if you can't think of shorter ones. Same applies to the `temporal_basis_vector`. I think you can even add a `temporal_basis` as you mentioned. Regarding the double line breaks wrapping top-level functions, I know the pep8 standard is two newlines but some other QuTiP modules follow just a single line break, e.g., [floquet](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/floquet.py). But again some other modules in QuTiP follow the pep8 standard and wrap two newlines for top-level functions. I am in favor of the pep8 standard and have two newlines. @ajgpitch what do you suggest?. Please remove the helper function `count_filled` without the test if it is not required. We aim to test as much as possible and remove redundancy in code. About `__all__`, I will shift all the rest in a new PR and we can keep yours as it is now. Coming to the more important discussion regarding the `class` based implementation, I have started pushing for similar approaches in newer modules such as [qutip.models.piqs](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/models/piqs.py). I am also working on a new non-Markovian method which requires a class. Something of that sort is already used in `qutip.nonmarkov.heom`. I understand that many of qutip's solvers are written to be isolated functions but that should not mean that we should not write code to fully use the object oriented framework Python provides. Moreover, I noticed that you have to rewrite wrappers for the functions anyways to deal with repeatedly calculating things such as `scattering_probability` which clearly can be made much more compact if we use a class based approach. I am not making this suggestion just for the minor performance impro",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/848#issuecomment-384860713:989,test,test,989,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/848#issuecomment-384860713,1,['test'],['test']

Regarding problem (b), the problem was that we requested more processes than the default number of slots available. With OpenMPI, the default number of slots available is the number of physical cpu cores (which seems to be 2 on the machine running our tests, leaving only one slot for a worker process). In the `parallel` module, if num_cpus is not provided, it defaults to `available_cpu_count()` (which is 4 on this machine, since there are 4 logical cpus). We could try to find a better default value for num_cpus for mpi_pmap, but I feel like writing that well would require deeper MPI knowledge than I have.

My hope is that our mcsolve function can allow users to choose which strategy to employ in the simulation, as both of the strategies are valuable for different purposes, as I have claimed in my earlier thread. This is the feature I am looking for. Is that feasible and reasonable?; > ; > I read over the mcsolve code a little bit. From my understanding, the core algorithm of the MC simulation is in the ODE's single-trajectory definition part (_mc_alg_evolve...). Looks like the code is applying the second strategy I mentioned before. But I am not totally sure, as I am confused and got lost on many variables. Like, what does the RHS of the ODE mean?

This was done with commit 624405e7, SciPy 1.6.2 and Numpy 1.19.5. My BLAS version has chopped and changed an awful lot, but I believe that run was with MKL implementations. The ""random"" stack trace from pytest looks to me like the error came about during garbage collection, and I really don't imagine pytest is to blame. We have in the past had issues with some bad calls in SciPy linalg functions, so it's _possible_ that they are the cause again, but I doubt it; we'd expect the stack traces to reliably show scipy to be the problem in that case. I wasn't able to reproduce this segfault on Windows, but that doesn't mean a huge amount, because I also can't reliably reproduce it on Mac. I suspect that the cause is some dodgy handling of pointers in the `struct CSR_Matrix` type in `qutip/cy/sparse_routines.pxi`, but this is just a suspicion. As far as I remember, I have _never_ seen this segfault when using the `dev.major` branch, which completely removes `CSR_Matrix` and replaces it with a much more robust Cython `CSR` type, which adds to my suspicion, but again, because the reproducer is unreliable, I cannot be sure.

Testability,"y.linalg.eigh_tridiagonal`. This lets us get the full eigensystem of `T`, which is related to that of `G` by dividing the eigenvalues by the scaling factor, and multiplying the eigenvectors by `P` to transform them into the correct basis. We now have a diagonalised matrix `G = Q^-1 . D . Q`, so `exp(G) = Q^-1 . exp(D) . Q`, which is now trivial because `D` is diagonal. Putting all this together allows us to use our knowledge of the problem domain to convert the matrix exponentiation problem into a much simpler real-symmetric tridiagonal eigensystem problem, which gets us a nice big speed up, and it's equivalent up to the tolerance of the eigenvalue solver (~1e-14). Even better for you, a lot of the hard work is done in the eigensystem solver, and I scaled out `alpha` at the start, so we can do a good chunk _without fixing alpha_. That means we can pay the computational cost only once at the start, and then get faster calculations from then on. If I make a totally fair test, and simply replicate the full functionality of `qutip.displace` (including creating a `Qobj` at the end), my method is ~4x faster on small matrices (`1 <= dim <= 20`) and it only goes up from there (I found it's about ~10x faster at `dim = 1000`, and beyond that `qutip.displace` is too slow to bother). If I store the calculation of the eigensystem, and output an `ndarray` instead of converting to `csr_matrix` (and so don't produce a `Qobj`), then I find speed ups in getting the operator for a new `alpha` as ~100x for small matrices and ~25x for large ones. The larger a matrix is, the more the computational time is dominated by the dense dot product at the end.

Usability," a bit silly that I haven't yet, since one thing that was frustrating me previously was not understanding what was trying to be done! I think as time goes by I'm getting a bit better about being clearer in the code - some of the earlier parametrizations I did were too aggressive because I wasn't used to the tools yet. The `test_control_pulseoptim` parts are very complex, in part because the underlying calling convention of that code is complex too. I'll try and add more comments to it to ease that along, especially in the part where I just defined a load of systems to test. That certainly should have been commented. There are general comments about what I was using the `pytest` tooling for in the commit messages, but I didn't necessarily want to leave ""intro to pytest"" comments throughout, because it would mostly crowd out the actual tests, and the `pytest` documentation online is probably going to be a better explanation than what I can do. I'm also learning `pytest` by doing this (I'd not used it before I opened the first PR)!. About the PRs: I'm happy with whatever workflow works best for you guys - I don't have any control over when the PR gets merged. It might be a little difficult for me to maintain two branches at once (i.e. if the first PR with ~10 tests is awaiting merging), because there's likely to be conflicts in `conftest.py` (in particular). Even if I branched the new PR off the previous one on the expectation that it would be merged, I'd have to keep adding merge commits into (or force-rebasing) the other branch to keep it up-to-date, which wouldn't be completely ideal in that it would make a bit of a mess in the git log. If you want to merge this one (after I've gone through and put some more comments in), I'm happy to start a new one. I can also start a new one on a new branch, I think it might just make a bit more of a mess than it solves. I think this one only got big because I had a good amount of free time at the same time as a `qutip` release h",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-591413241:1027,learn,learning,1027,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-591413241,1,['learn'],['learning']

For completeness, the rest of this comment is stuff I find out while researching. ## The `__array__()` and `__array_wrap__()` methods. These have been special methods understood by numpy since at least 1.3 (2009 - the oldest docs still on scipy.org), and I imagine long before then too. `__array__` is mentioned (and still is) in the documentation of `np.array`, which is unchanged since 2009 and says that its argument should be; > An array, any object exposing the array interface, an object whose `__array__` method returns an array, or any (nested) sequence. and `__array_wrap__` is like the reverse - it's for coercing numpy arrays back into this class. If we were to keep `__array__` in `Qobj`, we should also implement `__array_wrap__` for coercion back (something that isn't currently implemented). At the time and up to inclusively 1.19, the presence of `__array__` caused otherwise scalar types passed alone to `np.array` to return the output of `inp",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1433#issuecomment-772608902:2670,clear,clear,2670,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1433#issuecomment-772608902,1,['clear'],['clear']

Usability,"1. Adding a new data type is a large undertaking which will likely be very infrequent, so it's perhaps not so sensible to optimise in favour of making this especially simple. More likely is that new operations will be added to the data layer more frequently (e.g. you found that you wanted specific things for `CQobjEvo`), and this format makes _those_ PRs much easier to review. But mostly, because organising by file type is ok when all operations are like `matmul(CSR, CSR) -> CSR`, but which file should the operation `matmul(CSR, Dense) -> COO` go into? Much easier to find what you're looking for if all `matmul` functions are together, and then setting up the dispatcher will be the last item in the `matmul` file. It also means the files stay a bit smaller and easier to manage within themselves - you're less likely to ""lose"" code when each module is small and very focussed. 2. Exactly - it's more of an internal type. Currently `Qobj` converts the underlying data object to dense `ndarray` and prints it for its `repr` method - I don't have any plans to change that, so `Qobj` will still be full and user-facing. My `CSR` repr actually just tells you the same information that `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` does, just in a slightly more Python-looking form. 3. Yes, in some form or another. Perhaps we could talk about the best way to do that in a future meeting?. 4. `PyDataMem_NEW` isn't actually a Python routine, it's a numpy one, but that's largely irrelevant. The Python equivalent is `cpython.mem.PyMem_Malloc` and family. The reason I don't use the latter in general is because sometimes `PyMem_Malloc` allocates into Python-reserved stack-space, and if we subsequently pass the pointer to numpy, it will try to free it and cause a segfault. The reason for using `malloc` and `free` here is mostly just because there was a comment in the code I copied it from saying that raw `malloc` and `free` were slightly faster for allocating heap space to be released within the same function, so",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1296#issuecomment-648270004:167,simpl,simple,167,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1296#issuecomment-648270004,1,['simpl'],['simple']
Usability,"5.0 - we can change its backend, but I think it'll be a huge hindrance to adoption of 5.0 if we make major breaking changes to effectively our premier function, and I don't see a need to do that. We can add, rather than change, and keep `mesolve` as the ""quick-and-dirty"" method that just works.; > * I'm in favour of exposing the different parts of the `mesolve` process as user-accessible, composable chunks. So something like exposing a `mesolve_prepare_ode(H, state, c_ops) -> OdeState` function, where `OdeState` has properties `rhs: QobjEvo`, `state: Qobj`, `time: float` (`sesolve_prepare_ode` and `mcsolve_prepare_ode` would presumably return the same object, or a derived object). Then we'd have an `Integrator` class, which encapsulates an integration step using whatever integrator of choice, so there's one that encapsulates the scipy integrator, one which is a Cython-ised RK4 implementation, etc. Then the low-level user would simply write the `for time in times` loop themselves; at this level, there's nothing fancy that QuTiP adds, so we may as well just expose it directly. That sounds like the exact right solution! ;-). > I think this architecture is approximately what Eric had in mind too, though I presumably haven't used the same names. Yeah, I think we're actually all on the same page, irrespective of minor implementation/naming details: Have an object that keeps internal state of `mesolve` and allows to advance step-by-step. Personally, I like the naming of `MeSolver` that @Ericgig wrote out in https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-858740451, but `mesolve_prepare_ode`/`OdeState` works too. @Ericgig in https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-859791561:. > Most of scipy's solver are not ""thread-safe"", but we will be able to use other solvers in the new version.

Maybe there is some middle ground. My initial thought was to do something like use tuples instead of `Seq` and lists instead of `Par`, but that then ran into a couple issues.

Usability,"> General comment about plotting on the Bloch sphere:; > ; > QuTiP currently supports drawing either ""points"" or ""vectors"" (i.e. arrows). Both are specified as `(x, y, z)` coordinates and these are _not_ required to lie on the surface of the sphere. Lying outside the sphere is perhaps a bit odd, but lying inside the sphere is a common occurrence -- e.g. when plotting sub-components of a density matrix.; > ; > There is a method `add_states` that converts states into `(x, y, z)` coordinates and adds them as either points or vectors as requested.; > ; > I would thus recommend being able to specify lines and arcs using either `(x, y, z)` coordinates or states and not introducing spherical coordinates right now.; > ; > I'm not against duplicating some of the functionality of `add_points(..., meth=""l"")` in the new functions we add here. For one, the `meth=""l""` is not particular intuitive when looking for a function to draw lines, and, secondly, it doesn't provide particularly flexible styling.; > ; > My vote is to keep the old method interfaces fairly consistent with how they are now so as not to disrupt existing uses (adding some new optional parameters or tweaking things to look better is fine), and to add a couple of new methods.

Usability,"> However if `default_dtype` can be seen as _running in that mode_, it certainly could cause confusion. It's not clear how it is understood in some places.

Or should only the returned ket be in CSR format?; > ; > In my tries, the dense steadystate was faster that the sparse one. Could it be an issue that some matrices where too big to fit in RAM forcing to use swap space? We could have a warning when matrices over a certain size are allocated. I guess this was mostly because I wasn't explicitly calling steadystate with sparse=False so it was getting converted back to CSR anyway, and slowing things down. Largely I see similar performance between CSR and dense (using sparse=False), unless I use very small systems (16x16 Liouvillians), though this seemed a bit scipy/method dependent. I guess as you said this also raises the question about whether stuff like eigenstates and steadystate() should default to using methods based on the data layer of the object, instead of kwargs? My feeling is not, since eigenstates+sparse can be bad and steadystate+largesystem+dense could be bad, so its worth having some default conversion cost in place.

I ended up always calling `e_ops` functions with `f(t, ado_state)`. This is a bit different to other solvers, but makes what the HEOMSolver considers the evolution state consistent.

Usability,"> I suspect the method of using QobjEvo that was suggested above only use two time steps (initial and final time) in evolving the Hamiltonian as the seed and interpolate the Hamiltonian at the time between the initial and final time using some interpolation function. This is not the case. The answer to your question is to use `QobjEvo` as suggested. For example, here is a simple example using a fast-oscillating array function in a `QobjEvo` and a much shorter `tlist` in `mesolve`. You may need to set the solver options `nsteps`, `atol` and `rtol` to suitable values, as I have done here. ```python; import qutip; import numpy as np. fast_ts = np.linspace(0, 1, 1001); fast_xs = 2.9e3*np.pi * np.cos(2*np.pi * 2.91e2 * fast_ts); # This is the behaviour you were suggesting is happening.; bad_interpolation_xs = np.array([fast_xs[0], fast_xs[-1]]). H = qutip.QobjEvo([[qutip.sigmax(), fast_xs]], tlist=fast_ts); H_bad = [[qutip.sigmax(), bad_interpolation_xs]]; rho = qutip.basis(2, 0).proj(); times = np.array([0., 1]); e_ops = [qutip.sigmay()]; options = qutip.Options(nsteps=10_000_000, atol=1e-14, rtol=1e-12). two_times = qutip.mesolve(H, rho, times, e_ops=e_ops, options=options); many_times = qutip.mesolve(H, rho, fast_ts, e_ops=e_ops, options=options); bad_times = qutip.mesolve(H_bad, rho, times, e_ops=e_ops, options=options). assert len(two_times.expect[0]) == 2; assert len(many_times.expect[0]) == 1001. print(two_times.expect[0][-1]) # -0.59736575; print(many_times.expect[0][-1]) # -0.59736575; print(bad_times.expect[0][-1]) # -4.5466086e-08; ```. You can see that I was able to do a successful integration with only 2 times in `mesolve`, but many in a fast-oscillating Hamiltonian.

Besides, [`check_unitary`](http://qutip.org/docs/latest/apidoc/classes.html?highlight=check_isunitary#qutip.Qobj.check_isunitary) is a public API, it is a class method under `Qobj`, rather than a function, see bellow. > Qobj vs qobj link. `qutip.qobj.isoperbra` and `qutip.Qobj.isoperbra` are different. The lower case `qobj` is a submodule in QuTiP (qobj.py) while `Qobj` is a class. `isoperbra` is not a class method under `Qobj`. It is a function defined under the submodule `qobj`. So only `qutip.qobj.isoperbra` is the correct path. To make the life simpler, I would recommend to use the shortcut ``:func:`.isoperbra` `` for functions and ``:meth:`.Qobj.class_method` ``. Or even simpler: ``:obj:`.isoperbra` ``. Sphinx will automatically look for the correct match. As long as there are no two functions with the same name, we are safe.

One option is forbid them entirely from the data layer -- i.e. to check and raise an error whenever a new data layer is created. A potential downside to this is we'd have to check often to be sure, since any operation can potentially create `nan` and `inf`, even simple addition:; ```python; >>> 1e308 + 1e308; inf; >>> (1e308 + 1e308) - (1e308 + 1e308); nan; ```; an alternative is to try propagate `nan` and `inf` only as correctly as, e.g., `BLAS`.

We need to define clearly what we want to propose. E.g. Initially the request was just for the constructor to work, i.e. `Qobj(netket_operator)`, and later in the discussion it expanded to include all operations and methods, e.g. `qutip.groundstate(netket_operator)`, `qobj * netket_operator`, ... . These are proposals of quite different scope. 2. There clearly isn't a huge advantage either way to having `Qobj(netket_operator)` vs `netket_operator.to_qobj()` except perhaps that people don't need to remember to what kind of thing `netket_operator` is exactly if they are swapping between libraries. 3. It is already *almost* possible to implement `Qobj(netket_operator)` on top of QuTiP v5 (i.e. the dev.major branch) without any changes to QuTiP itself and it might be beneficial to close that slight gap for multiple reasons.

Usability,"@ajgpitch, I think that instance method picking is still somewhat of an issue in python 3, (which is what I use primarily) although I could be wrong. Either way, since the current QuTiP version supports 2.7, we would need to make this backward compatible to do multiprocessing correctly, so I'm glad you agree that option 3 is best. As to dropping python2 support, I think that this would be a good idea for v5.0, since [python is dropping support for 2.7 in two years](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/), which could be close to the time that QuTiP v5 is released (depending on how long the changes take). @sahmed95, thanks for making those final changes - sorry, I had forgotten to make the docstring capitalization changes.

Usability,"@arnelg and @cgranade, you are both raising good points here. I'm not exactly sure what the best solution for this particular issue is, but do tend to agree with @arnelg that we do not want functions that perform unexpected actions, if possible, and that explicit is better than implicit. However, ultimately, it has to be the docstrings that should resolve any ambiguities, because not all functions can be intuitive to everyone, since we all have different backgrounds and expectations. So if the current behaviour is clearly described in the docstring, it should also be an acceptable solution I think. But one important thing that @arnelg also alluded to is that if at some point we expect that we might want to use `composite(S, O)` to mean something different than `composite(S, to_super(O))`, then we should better not implement the operator-to-superoperator promotion implicitly in `composite` now. Since the `composite` function is brand new it might be a good idea at this point to avoid doing these implicit assumptions on how it will be used until various use-cases has been explored in more details. I absolutely agree that it is great to have discussions about these kind of design issues, and it's great that you both have taken an interest in this particular issue. I also agree that Qobj.dims is a bit obscure and not that flexible, and maybe insufficient for complex cases with mixes of operators, kets, superoperators along different subsystems. This would not be an easy thing to change, but having a discussion about the short-comings and possible solutions would be great.

Usability,"@bopardikarsoham It can definitely still be looked at, but the situation needs to be untangled before any code change is made:. - If one is using Lindblad operators (see the equation with `L_i` on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindbladian) then `a` and `b` are the same and the code is currently correct.; - If one is using some other set of basis operators `A_n` for the bounder operators on `H`, then you will need to include terms for both `n, m` and `m, n` and the sum of the those two terms will again be the same for the current code and the proposed change. So the physics will not change from what it is now if we make the proposed change and it appears that how the terms are organized within the larger sum is a convention. So the question is whether there is a standard convention to follow or not, and I don't know the answer. Step 1 is probably to find some textbooks or canonical references which make the choice clear.

Usability,"@cgranade I'm really liking the overall look of the Instrument class -- it's a much easier way to deal with measurements than calling the measurement operations all the time & of combine measurement operations with other operations on Qobjs. I'm keen to hear feedback from others too, but in the mean time I'm going to note some thoughts here for when I come back to this:. * It would be good to think about how all the operations on Qobj match up with QuTiP version 5 (since this draft is based on v4 currently).; * I'd like to think about removing `Seq` and `Par` and replacing them with some simple rules for sequences, strings and numbers. This would match, e.g., `qutip.ket(""01"")` and `qutip.basis([2, 2], [0, 1])`. `Seq` and `Par` do however make it really clear that in one case measurements follow each other on the same subspaces and in the other they are performed simultaneously on different subspaces, so I'm not quite sure. Maybe there is some middle ground.; * In QuTiP it's more normal to have the helper constructors not on the class as classmethods. I do like secondary constructors as classmethods, but I think in cases like this where there are essentially an infinite number of possible constructors, it makes sense to not ""bless"" any of them by sticking them on the class.; * It would be good to have one really nice use case that we could turn into a guide entry in the documentation. The current small examples are great, but it would be good to add one slightly bigger worked example that did something more ""exciting"".; * I would not push everything into the `qutip` namespace (largely because we would likely not want that in v5, although I should actually check what v5 is doing in `qutip.__init__` these days).; * We should decide whether to target QuTiP 4.7 or 4.7 and 5 for this. Target just v5 means not having to worry about making it nice in both, but will mean it'll be a bit more of a delay before release).

Usability,"@goerz I think one of Mølmer's papers (maybe the one I have pointed out) addressed the equivalence of the two methods. Sorry, I don't have a definite paper to point out at this moment. I was actually organizing the Julia community to work on this direction (see [JuliaQuantum](http://juliaquantum.github.io)) from scratch, and hence didn't follow up the efforts in the measurement simulation within QuTiP. . When I was writing my paper on continuous measurement ([PRA, 93.023817](http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.93.023817)), I came up the argument that the former method may be more appropriate for measurement models. This is because measurements have to happen in evenly spaced time steps determined by the detector's integrating time, so it is intuitive to use a random number to judge if on each measurement step the quantum jump will happen. There may be a way to use the second method to implement the same measurement simulation model, but I didn't think too much on it. In reality, I developed another more efficient method without actually evolving the density operator in my paper to simulate continuous measurement using a set of stochastic equations for squeezing thousands of atoms' state which has not been included in QuTiP yet. Sorry I don't have more useful reference that explains this point in more details at this moment.

Usability,"@hodgestar. > I don't know what this measures exactly (e.g. is there clock scaling of some sort so that the measured CPU frequency might not be the maximum CPU frequency?) and it seems a lot of work to get a piece of information that isn't used directly by QuTiP, ... My code implementation is actually very simple. The [script](https://github.com/BitesPotatoBacks/osx-cpufreq/blob/main/osx-cpufreq/main.m) works by measuring the time it takes to execute a decrementing loop (the loop will take a certain amount of CPU cycles to complete based on the CPUs frequency). The loop is executed using inline assembly. The assembly is `volatile` to prevent the loop from being moved and reprioritized by the system (This increases accuracy). Then we do some calculations with some very special numbers and voila -- we've found our CPUs current frequency. I've gotten this trick to work on x86 now as well. > ... so I just fixed the result to 3.2 GHz for now (which according to Wikipedia is the clock speed for current M1s). I believe it would be best to refrain from setting a fixed value of 3.2 Ghz, because this may create issues for future machines with newer silicon that (may) run at higher or lower frequencies. On Apple Silicon, if you _must_ use sysctl, use `sysctl hw.tbfrequency`. This is basically Apple Silicon's version of `sysctl hw.cpufrequency`.

Usability,"@jakelishman this is great, also thanks @dweigand for this PR. I tried out the function and it is very fast and could be great for specific use cases. My idea was a bit more simple - precomputing the `coherent_dm` operators (using qutip.coherent_dm) and using the `expect` function. But that performs worse that the original `qfunc` as well as this implementation of course. So this is great. I would be happy to merge this but have one thought:. This new implementation is sacrificing the ease-of-understanding of how Q-functions are computed with a very efficient and fast, but complicated class-based implementation. This means that users who want to look under the hood will not fully understand how this is working. I believe the crux of this implementation is a fast computation of the tensors of `coherent_dm` operators for all the alpha values at (x + iy). Personally, on many occasions, I have looked at qutip implementations of quantum operations just to understand what is happening under the hood and I believe several users have often done this to hack around. If someone were to try and understand Q-function computation from this code, it seems simple enough with the call:. ```; np.abs(np.dot(alphas, (self._g*0.5)*vector))**2; ```. for state vectors, or decomposing a density matrix into state vectors and then running the above call. Or . ```; out = np.polyval(; (0.5*g * vector / np.sqrt(scipy.special.factorial(ns)))[::-1],; alpha.conj,; ); ```. But the object `alpha` now constructed with `_qfunc_alpha_matrix` class is a bit difficult to understand. The variable `self.conj = np.empty(x.shape, dtype=np.complex128)` creates a tensor and sets it to a mesh grid (x, -y), but then what does the `__call__()` return? The tensor of `coherent_dm(x+iy)` for each x and y coordinate? But how is it computing it without knowing the Hilbert space dim for the state, which I think is computed on the fly by `ns = np.arange(first, last).reshape(1, 1, -1)`. It seems it caches the `coherent_d",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1583#issuecomment-877241762:174,simpl,simple,174,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1583#issuecomment-877241762,1,['simpl'],['simple']

Usability,"@jakelishman, about the two issues you raised:. 1. Import time related to `import qutip`; I agree with you that in order to make it frictionless for downstream libraries to implement qutip's interface you'd want not to increase their loading times. That would easily be achieved by defining the `__qutip_qobj__` as the entry point of this API. A drawback of this implementation is that it requires the conversion method to be defined on the object itself.; The dispatch-like solution, as was proposed by @hodgestar, is easier to play with, can be defined in a separate file, can be added to a separate package like `netket_qutip_interop` or even using setuptools entry points, though that would add complexity. Again, I'm personally not biased. I would go with option 1 because it's simpler, but I do like the organisational beauty of option 2 (that is used throughout the jax ecosystem). 2. About implicit conversion; - Assume we can distinguish two level of APIs exposed by qutip, similar in spirit to the distinction there is between BLAS and LAPACK. ; - There are low level (BLAS-like) operations on Qobjs such as addition, kron, sum, ecc that are performed repeatedly, can be efficiently implemented only among objects whose data structure is well know. Everything is built on top of those, so they need to be fast with a low overhead. ; - There are higher-level (LAPACK-like) operations on Qobjs, such as `.eigenvalues()` or `eigenstates()`, or `sesolve/mesolve` which are built by combining several low level operations. Their runtime is much higher, and they perform a fair bit of setup/input handling, which comes at the price of some overhead, but which is negligible compared to the runtime cost for most meaningfully large systems. I'd then like to state that; - *I have never suggested to insert a mechanism to insert implicit conversion in the low-level operations.* ; - In this RFC in no way have I proposed to implement implicit conversion anywhere else then were is already done in qu",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-913661687:783,simpl,simpler,783,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-913661687,1,['simpl'],['simpler']

With respect to plots - still I learnt them how to _make_ plots instead of just _using_ them, so after I make fixes I would appreciate . `complex_array_to_rgb` I am exposing it on purpose, not by an accident (see `__init__.py`).; The rationale is following: in QM one works with complex numbers, be it in wave functions, density matrices or other operators. However, I am not aware of cmap-like functions for complex numbers in Scipy (except for some dedicated packages; see also: [my answer to this StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15207255/is-there-any-way-to-use-bivariate-colormaps-in-matplotlib/17113417#17113417)). If you do know a more standard/supported/general/canonical method of mapping complex numbers to colors, I would be happy to use it (instead of `complex_array_to_rgb`). Otherwise, having `complex_array_to_rgb` exposed allows plotting other kinds of things.; For example:. ```; imshow(complex_array_to_rgb(a_density_matrix.full()), interpolation='none'); ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/105#issuecomment-41377018:151,learn,learnt,151,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/105#issuecomment-41377018,1,['learn'],['learnt']
Usability,"@maij Thanks! The test code looks like a good start. Could you add it to `qutip/tests/test_wigner.py`?. Other tests we could add:. * We could write a more general test that compares the output of spin_q_function to a simpler implementation based on the definition -- something like:; ```python; state = qutip.spin_coherent(spin, theta_prime, phi_prime); direct_q = (state.dag() * qutip.ket2dm(psi) * state).norm() / np.pi; ```; Note: I named the angles `theta_prime` and `phi_prime` to emphasize that we can apply this test to cases where the angles for the state psi and the ones passed to spin_q_function are different. * We should also add a test for passing in arrays of theta and phi (i.e. were we really get out a mesh grid for Q values) since that was the primary use case for which `spin_q_function` was defined. Ideas for future PRs:. * It would be nice to also add tests for `spin_wigner` (I am suspicious of it now because of the problems with spin_q_function).

Usability,"@maij The code is looking good to me. I've requested some changes and after that I'd like to do a final review, but I think we're in good shape. My thoughts on the remaining questions:. > Decide if the spin_wigner function should return only real values be default (as is currently done for the spin_q_function). I'm +1 on returning real values since the Wigner function is real valued and this is more consistent (unless you're aware of any strange cases where it might somehow not be?). > Decide whether to integrate the W function normalization in _rho_kq rather than at the top level. We divide all terms by (2*j + 1) only to end up multiplying it back out at the end which is a waste of time (_rho_kq is called d**2 times, d=2*j+1) . The benefit of leaving it as-is is that it reads like most definitions in literature. I'm +1 on sticking to the definitions in literature unless there is a measured speed penalty. `2*j + 1` likely can't be that big and the small number of arithmetic operations required is probably dwarfed by the matrix multiplications happening. . > Decide if normalization factor for Wigner and spin Q function should be included (Davis et al. suggest the normalization factor is only introduced during integration: Eq 14 https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10167). Here I would try stick as closely as possible to the previous behaviour of these functions (i.e. cases which worked before should hopefully return the same answer now) and then document clearly what the normalization factor is and how it should be added or removed.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1632#issuecomment-904598186:1468,clear,clearly,1468,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1632#issuecomment-904598186,1,['clear'],['clearly']

Usability,"@nathanshammah: It seems that travis fails before it even gets to the testing, when calibrating openmp. I cannot replicate the error on my end, the calibration takes only about a second for me. I did make 535010d more similar to 5501b2e by no longer using numpy.testing.assert_raises, numpy.testing.assert_warns and a ResourceWarning. Instead I use a try-except construction now. That seems to have fixed things, so I suspect that importing/calling one of the functions or the warning makes openmp fail on the rig used by travis.

Usability,"@quantshah: Simon and I had temporarily stepped back from this one at the time, because we weren't entirely confident that the physics was being handled correctly - the initial version of the PR certainly had invalid physics, and it was hard to evaluate the new stuff from that perspective. It's changed since then, and it might be ok now, but it'll be easier to re-review now we've cleared the old context from our minds. About your Choi matrices - right now, `Qobj` doesn't have an `act` method, but that could well be a useful addition. It _does_ have `Qobj.__call__` which does a similar thing in a very few cases, so we could properly beef that up, but we might want to discuss exactly what spec it should have. @MrRobot2211: I very quickly glanced through the diff of this, but there still seem to be several points where I asked for changes that haven't been changed: things like removing unnecessary calls to `np.array`, and explaining _why_ dimensions needed to be changed in some tests. Can you go back through the PR and make sure you've addressed everything? Also, since you're trying to add new functionality, please make sure you add tests of explicit, analytically known cases against the whole matrix, in addition to the properties like the dimensions (also asked above). In a super ideal world it'd be great if you could find a published reference for those tests, but if the maths is simple enough that we can verify it by hand, then showing us would be ok.

Usability,"@sbisw002 All contributions to QuTiP must follow the pep8 standard. You should read https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/, especially the section on naming conventions. I see @nathanshammah has made some specific comments along these lines, but there are too many examples to begin to comment on them. But in general, we like descriptive names for variables. One exception we have to pep8 is that we allow some use of capital letters in variable names, but only at the start, as this relates well to the corresponding mathematics. We reserve these for operators and matrices (in the mathematical sense), so for instance `H` is ok for a Hamiltonian, but `N` is not okay for an integer. `H_cell` is also fine, but `cellH` or `cell_H` is not. All caps are not to be used for anything. If you wish to abbreviate 'periodic boundary condition', then `pbc` would be ok as a local variable, but not as an attribute name, `period_bnd_cond` would be good.

Usability,"A few points which came up:. - We can make the solve call very similar to `mesolve` where the user specifies a Hamiltonian, the coefficients describing the system and the size of the system as an argument dictionary. ```; system = {""N"": 100, ""emmission"": 0.5, ""loss"": 0.1}; pisolve(H, tlist, c_ops, e_ops, args=system); ```; - However this only works for Hamiltonians constructed with some specific operators. As the method is for dicke states only, the distinction between this solver and `mesolve` should be stated clearly. This is to prevent someone trying to pass a generic Hamiltonian. - Checks have to be included to make sure that the Hamiltonian and the operators specified are proper for the dicke states. - Since the user will not be concerned with the matrix M which governs the evolution `dp/dt = Mp`, we should probably find better ways to represent it and perform the dot product to generate RHS. @nonhermitian We have the M matrix as a pure dictionary of {(row, col): val}. We can write our own function for the dot product just by using this dictionary. Or, is it better to convert it into a sparse matrix and use Scipy's dot product function ?

You can still do the Taylor expansion to try (you can find a similar result for 3x3 spin matrices to the 2x2 case), but there's not going to be a cancellation I thought there might have been. Right now, QuTiP doesn't support arbitrary time-dependence in collapse operators, so if you can't find a way to write it in that form, you might have to do the integration manually yourself until we've added it - the QuTiP guide [explains how QuTiP does the integration](http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-monte.html).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1308#issuecomment-739883642:528,guid,guide,528,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1308#issuecomment-739883642,2,['guid'],['guide']

Usability,"Ah, nice catch thanks, and thanks for the super clear repro. We're overhauling the solvers for QuTiP 5.0, which will include a lot more rigorous input checking on entry, but also it uses far safer low-level datatypes that would catch this shape mismatch in the C layer (even though the `dims` _should_ have been checked by `mesolve`). I'll check the other solvers and patch in a sanity test - probably after these lines: https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/d5e305513d9186df74beee4fd8da680e89f29d15/qutip/mesolve.py#L259-L261; we can just insert a test; ```python; if rho0.dims[0] != rho0.dims[1]:; raise ValueError(; ""input state must be a pure state or square density matrix""; ); ```. There may also be other segfaults lurking if you use a Python function to generate a time-dependent `Qobj` value in the Liouvillian or the expectation operators, but right now you're unlikely to use that form (because it's slow as anything). The bug slips through because we unsafely pass off a matrix down to C code (where we currently don't have sanity checks) without first verifying that it is a valid shape in Python space - the C code is working as designed, so there shouldn't be problems with correct inputs. Removing `c_ops` causes `mesolve` to delegate to `sesolve` which presumably is better at its type-checking, and I expect that a small dimension size working is likely just `malloc` having slack in the memory it gives us for small sizes or small requests being allocated into the special pre-allocated store.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1456#issuecomment-791925169:48,clear,clear,48,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1456#issuecomment-791925169,1,['clear'],['clear']

Usability,"Anything we do will be made on the `dev.major` branch, where the constructor is _much_ simpler and easier to work with, which hopefully should make things rather easier for you. The dimensions objects will probably change a lot before then as well (they should in principle accept any type, it's just historical that they only accept `list`). The `Qobj` constructor is intended to allow the first argument to be passed positionally, but all others are _expected_ to be keyword-only. We'll probably start enforcing those semantics from 5.0 onwards (we need to issue deprecation warnings before we change behaviour). Answers to questions:; - For tensor products, we use the same ordering as `np.kron`. The column-stacking convention is about the conversion of operators into operator-kets when moving to the superoperator formalism.; - In theory it should recognise a suitable `dims`, but right now construction will be faster if you provide `type='super'` as well. Construction speed is hugely improved in `dev.major`. You only need to define `superrep` if you're giving us a Choi (`superrep='choi'`) or chi (`superrep='chi'`) matrix instead.; - No, it should really be any indexable quantity (requiring list is a historical artifact, not a conscious choice). The entire parsing structure of dimensions objects are going to change in 5.0 (though the list structure will still work). This should even give you more freedom, if you need it - I've got some plans for vastly improved handling of restricted-entry Hilbert spaces (basically spaces that are small embeddings into a larger space that's all 0).; - I am very strongly against accepting this (like I said above):. > Oh, one thing that I'd like to suggest we _don't_ do: use this interface to _implicitly_ create `Qobj` inside our functions.; ; To me, this is absolutely one of the mistakes that Numpy made in their implementation, and we shouldn't be copying it.

Usability,"Apologies for another long delay. I'd be happy to hop on a video call sometime to discuss the design.

Parameters; ---------------; copy : {True, False}, default True; If True, a new independent Qobj should be returned. If False, a reference to an existing Qobj; may be returned. Returns; ----------; Qobj; The Qobj representation of this object.; """""" ; return qutip.Qobj(self._stuff, copy=copy); ```; and we can figure out how to make that work on our side. How that looks under the hood depends quite a bit on whether the `Data` object will grow `dims` support or not. We have another use case for `dims` on the data layer (a tensor network data backend that we're starting work on) but it is a bit of a philosophical shift in what the `Data` layer is, so we'll need to think carefully (e.g. all `Data` operations would have to keep track of `dims` which is a big change; and it's also a bit strange because the operations themselves are just 2D matrix operations, where dims are meaningless). @PhilipVinc I'm not sure if we discussed this before, but do you have some short code snippets showing how you see this Qobj support being used in user code?

Obviously, this falls into the ""quite a bit of work"" category, assuming it's possible at all. Personally, I also want to clarify that in #853, I wasn't thinking clearly when I titled it ""moderately big tensor products"" (obviously, it was an insanely large product).

The original certainly isn't great, but I think its defaults have produced a somewhat better result in this case. It might be worth having a look at some of the defaults here, particularly with regards to the z-axis tic labelling. While we're at it, the rainbow colour scheme is not a good choice - it'd be much better to use a diverging colourmap, and preferably something a bit more perceptually uniform. ---. I'm not completely sold on the idea that our functions should take so many different optional arguments. We return the figure and axes instances, which means anything the user can do anything that's basic matplotlib commands - we don't need to reimplement their interface. Things like the figure size, azimuth and elevation are particular examples of this - it's very simple to set them using matplotlib's interface, and we don't really provide any added benefit by having the options here. Another is the truncated colourbars: why not only accept a `cmap` argument, and allow the user to pass anything that `matplotlib.pyplot.plot` would accept?

Usability,"As a note: `qutip.vector_to_operator` is part of the implementation of superoperators. The ""vector"" in the name refers to the idea that a superoperator in a Hilbert space can be represented as a vector on a different Hilbert space which comprises of two copies of the original space tensor-producted together. It doesn't refer to a ""vector"" in the sense of a ""ket"". The difference was introduced in c62a8e9, which is the amalgamated commit encompassing all the discussion in #1098. `qutip.vector_to_operator` expects to receive an argument whose `dims` parameter is of the form `[operator_dims , [1]]`, where `operator_dims` is the dimensions of a regular operator (for example `[[2], [2]]` for a single qubit Hilbert space, or `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]` for an operator acting on a Hilbert space with two qubits in. The exception occurs because `vector_to_operator` attempts to access the two elements of the `operator_dims` array to discover the output shape. Since there is an insufficient number of lists for it to access, it just ends up reading the dimensions of the first two elements of the tensor product, and `np.prod` (used to calculate the output shape) doesn't complain when passed scalars. Notice that running the code with `nb_qubits = 1` will cause an `IndexError`, as there are insufficient tensor-product elements. The immediate solution for your code is to use `qutip.ket2dm`, which converts a ket into a density matrix. I think this is what you're actually trying to do. For a fix, there are two points:; 1. The fix is simply to test that the input dimensions are of the correct form, rather than assuming; this will allow us to provide a more descriptive error.; 2. Perhaps worth considering is moving the super-operator functionality in a sub-module `qutip.super`, and not importing all the functions into the main namespace.

Usability,"Bumping an old topic with two major new considerations. Number one: Travis is [changing its pricing model for open source software](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing), and generally it seems like [it's going to become unfeasible for us](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/travis-cis-new-pricing-plan-threw-wrench-my-open-source-works). Over the past month or so, queue times on Linux builds have increased massively (from near-instant to up to 90 minutes), and the number of allowed concurrent builds has already limited the amount of testing we are able to do - we don't even have Windows tests because we couldn't fit them in. In around March 2021 we expect the old travis-ci.org that QuTiP is grandfathered onto to shut down completely, forcing us onto the new model on travis-ci.com. Number two: in November 2019, GitHub released their own CI, GitHub Actions. This is (as best as I can tell) completely free for open source, public repositories like QuTiP, and offers access to a large number of Linux, macOS and Windows containers. This completely free period of GitHub Actions might not last forever (you can imagine maybe they're just trying to drive adoption before increasing the cost), but especially with the new time pressure from Travis, this seems like the right choice for now. Our testing set up is fairly straightforward, so migrating to a new CI shouldn't be too difficult. I just wrote (#1429) a GitHub Actions workflow to build and distribute binary releases of QuTiP on Linux/Mac/Windows, and I'm pretty convinced by the power of their CI. It's got an awful lot of flexibility with a _lot_ of customisation so its initial learning curve is a little steep (or maybe I'm just not used to CI tools), but I'm impressed by what's available.

Usability,"For point 2: adding marks right now will cause conflicts, but if #1181 gets merged then it'll be much simpler. The main issue is that a lot of the testing structure has changed for tests up to `test_mcsolve.py` alphabetically, and so in general the tests are just not the same. The principle is pretty straightforwards - just like #1181 introduces a `requires_cython` mark, we would add `uses_cython`, `uses_mkl` and `uses_openmp` marks. These would be even simpler to add than `requires_cython` because unlike it, they don't require any test-generation logic at all. The change would simply be to add them to `pytest.ini`, mark the requisite functions and then change the pytest invocation of the specialised test to `pytest -m ""uses_cython""` or whatever. As far as I'm aware, the only parts of their codebase which modify their behaviour based on whether `Cython` is available is `QobjEvo`. The other parts (like `brmesolve`) just don't work if Cython isn't there. The MKL tests would become very short; by my reckoning, MKL is only used by `steadystate` and `countstat`. OpenMP is much more pervasive, as `sesolve`, `mesolve` and `brmesolve` all use it, and parts which depend on those are generally the slowest tests. The short tests could just become `pytest -m ""not slow""`? That's not super speedy, but it takes about half the time, maybe. If you want more, then a good starting point is `pytest --durations=0` which will tell us which tests are the slowest (perhaps that was what you already did when marking the slow ones?).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1217#issuecomment-604011776:102,simpl,simpler,102,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1217#issuecomment-604011776,3,['simpl'],"['simpler', 'simply']"

Usability,"General comment about plotting on the Bloch sphere:. QuTiP currently supports drawing either ""points"" or ""vectors"" (i.e. arrows). Both are specified as `(x, y, z)` coordinates and these are *not* required to lie on the surface of the sphere. Lying outside the sphere is perhaps a bit odd, but lying inside the sphere is a common occurrence -- e.g. when plotting sub-components of a density matrix. There is a method `add_states` that converts states into `(x, y, z)` coordinates and adds them as either points or vectors as requested. I would thus recommend being able to specify lines and arcs using either `(x, y, z)` coordinates or states and not introducing spherical coordinates right now. I'm not against duplicating some of the functionality of `add_points(..., meth=""l"")` in the new functions we add here. For one, the `meth=""l""` is not particular intuitive when looking for a function to draw lines, and, secondly, it doesn't provide particularly flexible styling. My vote is to keep the old method interfaces fairly consistent with how they are now so as not to disrupt existing uses (adding some new optional parameters or tweaking things to look better is fine), and to add a couple of new methods.

For all examples we could add details of a typical example with current times/bottlenecks (we could use gists). This can be of very wide interest, but finding physical examples of interests and use cases would be helpful. For example, qubit space nevertheless explodes exponentially. But adding even a bit more qubits in `steadystate` can impact state of the art simulation of dissipative phase transitions in many-body systems.

Usability,"He did - he's the original feature requester, but given super super weird interactions with ufuncs (see #1433), it's not so clear to me that it was _necessarily_ the right idea to implement especially now it's causing problems with how numpy arrays are used in the library. There always was a work-around; allowing `np.array(qobj)` was more to save him from writing `x = x.full() if isinstance(x, Qobj) else np.asarray(x)`. That said, I came round to the idea more as I read more about the control we can have over the rest of the numpy infrastructure. We can allow `np.array` on `Qobj` (satisfying Michael's original request), and with a little bit of extra code we can prevent all the super weird ufunc/implicit casting behaviour, because `Qobj` shouldn't be able to implicitly interoperate with raw arrays. I know in my personal code I'd rather use `Qobj.full()`, but I no longer think it's _wrong_ to allow `np.array(qobj)` given that other people like it, even with these numpy 1.20 problems.

Also using mech_dms = np.asarray(mech_dms) fails, I think because it sees a Qobj instead of a real number.; 3.

Usability,"Hi @Ericgig ; Thanks for investigating this so thoroughly. ; I guess it makes sense that unpacking a dict at each call is inefficient, so I think we should drop this idea. As you have suggested previously, users can always use module variables if they wish to avoid passing vars in `args`. So I think we should aim to keep it simple. I think adding `f(t)` as a signature option will be sufficient for what @goerz wanted and would be sufficient for using a Numba jit. So, my suggestion for the next major release (v5) would be that we have only two call sigs:; - `f(t, args)` (default); - `f(t)`. For now we will have to have the three (although I don't think the `rhs_with_state` is not widely used, if at all).; - `f(t, args)` (default); - `f(t)`; - `f(t, state, args)`; The default needs to remain as it is, because it is widely used. I think it makes sense to use introspection to decide which has been specified by the user, as the sig is clearly distinguishable by the number of args. So effectively we can ignore the `rhs_with_state` option, but I think we should give a deprecation warning that the `f(t, state, args)` signature will be removed in the next version. So, I think this means we can keep the new method of passing the state in the args dict. I would suggest we make it a bit more simple though. I notice that the processing of the option is a bit involved. So I suggest that any element of the `args` dict where the key is of the form `name:special_value_kind` be considered some kind of special value. If `special_value_kind` is not recognised then it should throw a `ValueError`. For now we will have the `special_value_kind` of:; - `state`: Qobj of the state at time `t`, with the correct dimensions; - `state_vec`: ndarray of state as a vector; - `expect`: I can't remember exactly what you did here. The `state_vec` will clearly be much more efficient, as this is what the ODE solver maintains. However, for completeness I think we should have the `state` option.

Usability,"Hi @VolodyaCO, thanks for reporting this!; I think the reason for `tlist` being overridden is because the result will be independent of `tlist` when the input is a steady-state. This can be seen in the following equations:; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57414022/121327018-5d313680-c913-11eb-9760-ca6004daca18.png); where rho is the initial state (`state0`) and H is the Hamiltonian of the system. I use the fact that rho is a steady-state to remove its temporal dependence. This derivation is simplified assuming unitary evolution (no collapse operators) but the same applies in the most general case where we include the collapse operators. This is my guess on why `tlist=[0]` is employed when using `state0=None`: the result does not depend on `tlist`. Hence, this is probably not a bug as the result should be mathematically correct. That being said, I would also expect the same output shape for the cases shown above unless explicitly mentioned in the docstring of the function. Thus, I think the way to go here is to document this behaviour in the docstring (as well as removing the t appearing in correlation_..._1t docstring) as any change in the output shape will break backwards compatibility. However, it may be worth considering whether this is the intended behaviour for QuTiP 5. I would suggest removing `state0=None` as possible input for simplicity in the maintenance and testing or at least I would make the example shown by @VolodyaCO to be consistent and have the same output.

This behaviour in QuTiP is intentional for the following reason: If the dims of the system are `[2, 2]` then it's unambiguous how the system should be partitioned into two parts because the dims specify what the two parts. If the dims are `[4]` then one could divide the system in multiple ways depending on how one considers the four basis vectors. If one knows that the four basis states are `00`, `01`, `10`, `11`, one can override the dims by writing `dm.dims = [[2, 2], [2, 2]]` or `qutip.Qobj(dm, dims=[[2, 2], [2, 2]])`. Hope this helps.

Usability,"Hi @jakelishman , Thanks for the great work and effort! I'm reading your code and also try to learn some pytest. . If I may, I have a minor suggestion. Could you maybe leave some more descriptive comments in the tests? I find it a bit hard to follow the logic when tests are automatically generated or parametrized, e.g. in test_control_pulseoptim. A lot of things are defined for the fixtures in the beging. It took me some time to understand what is happening. I guess it is because I'm not yet very familiar with the tools in pytest. Maybe some description like ; > We first define 4 test cases: ... or. > Test function1 against case1, case2 ... This might make it easier for whoever wants to add more tests later to understand what has been tested without too much digging. And another personal idea, maybe it is good to make a separate PR every 10 or 15 tests? A new branch can still base on this one. Just after the old PR is merged, fewer changes will be shown the new PR. It might make the later review a bit easier. Just personal ideas.

Usability,"Hi @jakelishman, I like your implementation but this will sometimes return a Qobj and other times a class instance when you call `displace()`. I am not in favour of that just out of the principle that functions should be simple and do one thing only as you also point out. . I would say if we do not want to break the user-interface, we keep the same implementation as `displace()` returning a `Qobj` (even if internally it calls the faster private `_Displace` method). . Users who want to use the class anyway can dig in and find `_Displace`. The use case here for moving to classes is rather specific and related to optimisation/control. We want to compute this operator very fast with multiple values of `alpha`, independently, on multiple cores (this was why we needed the faster implementation to run a GPU optimisation routine). Of course for sigmax(), or sigmay() we do not have any parameters to optimise and it is overkill to make them into classes. I do not suggest that at all. . I understand the inclination to be `functional`. It is how QuTiP was written and is supposed to be used, mostly. But one of the arguments for classes is that for some solvers, or operations we needed to re-use information, eg. qutip.piqs or the heom solvers where we had to make classes anyways. . I would propose just having a private `_Displace` method which is called by `displace` but not changing the output to be conditioned on `alpha`. Later on, if we incline a bit more towards classes we can make `Displace` public.

Usability,"Hi @michelinesoley,. Your bug report inspired me to dig into the `qutip.control.optimize_pulse` sparse matrix support which lead to some fixes in #1621. When you increase `N` in your example from 2 to 3, it changes the internal type used by the optimizer to represent propagators. You can also make the `N = 2` case fail by changing the last line to:. ```python; result = cpo.optimize_pulse_unitary(..., dyn_params=dict(oper_dtype=Qobj, sparse_eigen_decomp=True)); ```. Your example can be made to work for `N = 3` (albeit slowly) by changing the following lines:. ```python; mapped = Qobj(mapped, dims=[[N]*4 + [2]*4] * 2); ```; (which was a bug in the example itself -- it created a Qobj with the right shape but wrong dimensions) and the last line to . ```python; result = cpo.optimize_pulse_unitary(..., dyn_params=dict(oper_dtype=Qobj, sparse_eigen_decomp=False)); ```; For me the `N = 3` case was slower with `sparse_eigen_decomp=True`, but perhaps it will be better for your full problem. If you would like to try `sparse_eigen_decomp=True` you are welcome to try the patch in PR #1621 and I would appreciate feedback on any performance issues for larger systems.

Usability,"Hi Kevin. Thanks for your efforts on this. However, I am not in favor of merging this PR in this form. It is way too intrusive on the old API, it would break backwarks compatibility for no good reason as I see it. Personally I don't think that the _2t and _1t names are that confusing. As you point out, _1t is still a two-time correlation function (a one-time correlation function would not be a correlation function, just a simple expectation value), but the _1t and _2t is intended to refer to the number of free time variables. Perhaps this should be explained more clearly in the docstrings, but I don't think it is worth changing the API for this reason. I would prefer if you added the new mc solvers using the current API conventions, and preferably without changing the me and es based solvers. If you want to propose a new API the correct way to do it would be:; 1. First discuss the idea, so that everyone interested could weight in on the naming of the functions, the style of parameters and arguments etc.; 2. Implement the new API without disrupting the previous API; 3. Deprecate the previous API, so that using it gives a warning (but still works!). ; 4.

Usability,"Hi Louis,. There is work in development that will allow `QobjEvo` to be build from callback also, not just list. This will make callback work anywhere easily. . I was in the impression that H callback worked already for mcsolve. I rewrote part of mcsolve and broke it. Looking at your commit, I inverted `_funcrhs_with_state` and `_funcrhs`...; Sorry to have you take time to correct it. The 20x is big, but the list format allows for optimizations that are hard to do with a callback. A big one is that you don't need to create a new matrix/Qobj when calling `mul_vec`, just use it. With this code, I see a 20x between `mul_vec` and creating a Qobj a python function. . ```; import numpy as np; import qutip as qt. qoe = qt.QobjEvo([qt.qeye(3),[qt.destroy(3), lambda t,_:np.sin(t)]]); qoe.compile(). o1 = qt.qeye(3); o2 = qt.destroy(3) ; def H(t):; return o1 + o2 * np.sin(t). v = np.ones(3)+0j; %timeit qoe(0); %timeit qoe.mul_vec(0, v); %timeit H(0); %timeit H(0).data * v; ```. One optimization you could do is having the callback return a `np.array` instead of a Qobj. In `mcsolve`, this would probably be simple to implement and I expect some speed gain. But it can't really be officially supported in Qutip, for now. . ps. All those 'redundant' argument setting are for reusing the system (`ss`) in multiple call of `mcsolve` with different args, used in `correlation`. Using string coefficient, the compilation step can take a few second, so it is set to be able to reuse a compiled system, changing the `psi0`, `args`, `e_ops`, etc. This will become a less obscure feature in v5 when solver object are available.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1260#issuecomment-629231634:1111,simpl,simple,1111,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1260#issuecomment-629231634,1,['simpl'],['simple']

However, I think it is difficult to write a general solver using waiting time distributions, because they usually require some analytical treatment and are therefore problem specific. As far as I know, if you don't have an analytical mean of finding the correct waiting time distribution you need to use the comparison of the decaying norm and a random number. In the paper by Dum et al that you refer to they also use this method, which is very similar to the one we use in mcsolve (the description you give in the first paragraph is not quite correct; we do use the decay of the wavefunction norm in the condition for when jumps occurs, like in Dum et al). See Fig. 1 in that paper for example.

Usability,"Hi Subimal,. This happens because of the truncation of the Fock space. You can see a related discussion here ; https://groups.google.com/g/qutip/c/DD6z8kYUU1I/m/k48XZS1AAgAJ. But in short, with truncation there is always an error in the commutators, so for truncating the Fock states at N photons, I think you find that [a,a.dag()] = \sum_{n=0}^(N-1) |n><n| - N|N><N| (you can check this by writing out these operators as projectors onto fock states, you will notice a*a.dag() is missing a term due to the truncation that should cancel with a term in a.dag()*a). Similarly putting the creation and annihilation operators into the position/momentum definition of the Hamiltonian, you find H = sum_{n=0}^(N-1)(n+0.5) |n><n| + N/2 |N><N|. Hence, since you truncated at 9 photons in your example, there is a degeneracy of the 4.5 eigenvalue. I am not sure if there is much can be done about this in general, perhaps the discussion I linked above might be useful. The main message I suppose is always take a larger cut-off than you think you might need, particularly if you are relying on the commutation relations to simplify things for you (which, given your example, can be a bad idea some times!). . I guess there is an interesting question about what is the best practice in these things, e.g., if you have a non-linear model, what form is it best to put it in before moving to a truncated basis? given your example, I would expect something like normal ordering to be better.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1587#issuecomment-869408770:1113,simpl,simplify,1113,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1587#issuecomment-869408770,1,['simpl'],['simplify']
Usability,"Hi Vutshi. Yes, it is perfectly possible to implement the heterodyne detection using two homodyne detections with 50% efficiency, like you suggest. For the Milstein solver it might be the best, or at least the quickest, way to implement heterodyne, but I don't really agree that the current method is overcomplicated. It is in fact basically the same as the method you suggest, so I don't see that either would be more complicated or simpler than the other. The only issue is whether the two stochastic increments are divided up in several stochastic collapse operators or if the d2 function internally takes care of the both stochastic increments for a given stochastic collapse operator. The complexity is just shifted from the d2 function to somewhere else, which in general doesn't simplify anything. However, since the milstein solver you submitted is written so that it only support one increment per collapse operators, then there might be a real advantage of splitting the heterodyne process into two homodyne processes. . I've tried to make the qutip stochastic solver API as general as I could (and it is still a work in process), so that it will be as flexible as possible for implementing custom types of SMEs. Having support for multiple stochastic increments per collapse operators seems to be useful in certain applications. Although such SMEs could probably always be rewritten as multiple collapse operators with single stochastic increments, it might not always be the most natural way to define the SME. The heterodyne detection is one example of this, and it can be formulated in both ways, but I want the qutip SME API to work with both methods (at least with the basic euler solver, not necessarily with every solver we implement). However, that doesn't mean that the implementation of heterodyne for a particular solver has to use one way or the other. We should just document which solvers support multiple increments per operators and which solvers don't. So if it is easier t",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/35#issuecomment-22543416:434,simpl,simpler,434,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/35#issuecomment-22543416,2,['simpl'],"['simpler', 'simplify']"
Usability,"Hi again. I've looked at your notebook and code in some more detail now, and I have attempted to make the change in how the rhs function behaves. I had not seen an example where the contributions form different stochastic collapse operators depended on each other before, but I now see the need for having this possibility from looking at your implementation of the Milstein implementation with multiple Wiener processes. I have created a new branch in qutip called sme-rhs-restructuring (see commit 0b4a1a7a6591aca27ff6cb71310cf73af7ae2d7f and https://github.com/qutip/qutip/tree/sme-rhs-restructuring) where I have experimented with rhs functions that internally loop through the A_ops list. In simple cases it only loops through the list and calculates a contribution for each stochastic collapse operator, but now it is also possible to do something more sophisticated, like in your milstein solver. I've edited your notebook so that it uses the standard (now modified) smesolve and your rhs functions for the milstein methods. http://nbviewer.ipython.org/6153688. Note that I still only use the rhs function for the contributions due to the stochastic collapse operators (both the deterministic and stochastic part), and it does not include the unitary part or the deterministic collapse operators (if those are given as well), so it is not quite what you suggested when proposing that the rhs should calculate \rho_{n+1}. Do you think this approach is reasonable, or do you see any problems with it?. Regarding your milstein implementation, it seems that it is only valid for homodyne detection, since your have hardcoded the d1 and d2 function into the rhs function. I've tried to separate the definition of the SDE (d1 and d2) from the implementation of the SDE integrator (rhs), and naively it seems like you could use the d1 and d2 functions in rhs_milstein to make it possible to use it with hetrodyne detection as well.

Usability,"Hi guys,; yeah, the conflicts are because of the now merged #1224, which we knew about when we merged that one. It's a simple fix, but I'm hesitant to do it directly on this PR, depending on how we want to merge it. The simplest way is that I make the required changes, fix the merge conflict, and we keep going until this whole behemoth merges in one go. This ends up in the commit history being a bit of a mess, and it'll take ages. Instead, I think it might be better if I instead split this PR into a few different ones:; 1. add `pytest` markers and other test niceties; 2. the test files that Eric is checking; 3. the QIP-related ones so that Boxi can check those; 4. `brmesolve` tests; 5. trivially changed files; 6. whatever's left. This has the advantage that I can rebase them all individually to neaten them up with any changes suggested, and we can get parts merged in faster. PRs 2 to 6 will depend on PR 1, so this would require getting that first one merged ASAP, then the others will all be modular and can be merged in any order at any speed.

I had a poke around in discussion forums for numpy and scipy, and it seems like the problem is that they throw an exception when they decide L is ""exactly singular"" (which technically it is). Sometimes numerical rounding errors prevent this exception, as occurs in larger systems, or adding a finite frequency, so it tries to solve it anyway and succeeds, because the projector Q on the right-hand side guarantees a solution.

Usability,"Hi!. #### Imports; Honestly it wasn't really a particularly conscious decision, and there's no problem with `from qutip import (x, y, z)` lines though I don't think `from qutip import *` is a very good idea, especially with quite how many names `qutip` exports. The `from qutip.very.deep.nested.module import name` is certainly good, and I think I've generally left those. I think I started converting in a few places because there were things like `from qutip import Cubic_Spline` and `from scipy.interpolate import CubicSpline`, and then the test was unreadable as to which was which. Having `qutip.Cubic_Spline` and `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline` is unambiguous. The smaller cases like `from qutip import Qobj` are highly unlikely to have any conflicts, but in general I just went for consistency. That all said, there's certainly arguments both ways, e.g. explicit `qutip.member` is good because it's clearly explicit at point of use which makes reading the code much easier, but bad because it adds unnecessary chaff which makes scanning lines take longer. I hadn't put much thought into it before, and I think I was just generally writing in my default style. #### Test ordering; I hadn't much considered this, but there are certainly ways of doing it. Essentially `pytest` goes through a few stages when you run `pytest` on the command line: discovery, generation, running, reporting, and it has lots of hook functions we can define to modify the state inbetween and during each of them. Default discovery is as you say: files in alphabetic order (I _think_ it's strictly shell globbing order, but generally that's alphabetical), then the contents of each file in order defined by the shared fixtures used. We tend not to need large amounts of state to be held in fixtures, so our files largely just run top-to-bottom. We can add in some logic into the collection-time hooks to re-order the tests. There's a `pytest` plugin called [`pytest-ordering`](https://github.com/ftobia/pytest-ordering)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-601793386:906,clear,clearly,906,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1181#issuecomment-601793386,1,['clear'],['clearly']
Usability,"Hi!. About the comments: yes, absolutely I'll leave more. It's a bit silly that I haven't yet, since one thing that was frustrating me previously was not understanding what was trying to be done! I think as time goes by I'm getting a bit better about being clearer in the code - some of the earlier parametrizations I did were too aggressive because I wasn't used to the tools yet. The `test_control_pulseoptim` parts are very complex, in part because the underlying calling convention of that code is complex too. I'll try and add more comments to it to ease that along, especially in the part where I just defined a load of systems to test. That certainly should have been commented. There are general comments about what I was using the `pytest` tooling for in the commit messages, but I didn't necessarily want to leave ""intro to pytest"" comments throughout, because it would mostly crowd out the actual tests, and the `pytest` documentation online is probably going to be a better explanation than what I can do. I'm also learning `pytest` by doing this (I'd not used it before I opened the first PR)!. About the PRs: I'm happy with whatever workflow works best for you guys - I don't have any control over when the PR gets merged. It might be a little difficult for me to maintain two branches at once (i.e. if the first PR with ~10 tests is awaiting merging), because there's likely to be conflicts in `conftest.py` (in particular). Even if I branched the new PR off the previous one on the expectation that it would be merged, I'd have to keep adding merge commits into (or force-rebasing) the other branch to keep it up-to-date, which wouldn't be completely ideal in that it would make a bit of a mess in the git log. If you want to merge this one (after I've gone through and put some more comments in), I'm happy to start a new one.

Usability,"Hi, interesting, thank you for your detailed description!. > When the transformation is made for DrudeLorentzBath, the result generated differs from that for DrudeLorentzPadeBath (and it is not about the number of frequencies used). First of all, are you sure that either of `DrudeLorentzBath` and `DrudeLorentzPadeBath` give the right solution? Because the `ck_real` / `vk_real` are supposed to be the coefficients / exponents of the real part of the correlation function (and the others the imaginary part), and if you plug in imaginary parameters, then terms that previously were only in the real parts could pick up imaginary parts etc. Perhaps this kind of thing cancels out when you add the two unphysical D-L baths to get the shifted D-L bath?. Regarding your proposed solution -- I would say, in the case where `gamma` is not real, the spectral density is unphysical and there is no *a priori* correct way to handle this case. In other words, in a sense, the code before the change is wrong (or right) and the code after the change is just as wrong (or right). I therefore think it wouldn't hurt to implement this change so that your use case can be supported. However, I would want to be very sure that in the case where the parameters are all real, the results are not affected by the change. Is that so?

Usability,"Hi, thank you very much for the quick responses and linking the other issues. . > But your making sparse matrices dense. Yes, I agree. But I was trying to just work out a simple problem which looks like. `dp[n]/dt = spre(Q)*p[n-1] + spost(Q)*p[n+1]. where p is a list of flattened density matrices. I understand that a better version of this would be to completely flatten p and write the RHS as a large `L` as Alex points out and then use `cy_ode_rhs`. But here is the issue, in the HEOM case, building `L` runs out of memory if we consider a large size for the set of auxiliary density matrices `p`. As such, I cannot completely build the `L` for the cases I am looking into. The approach that I was trying to take was to keep building the p's as we integrate. In this case, each RHS computation is a small dense matrix-vector computation and I can choose to keep or discard it depending on the max value of its elements. This gives the flexibility to truncate how many auxiliary density matrices I keep. The motivation is that in some papers on the Heom method, there is a dynamic filtering of the auxiliary matrices and it has been shown that with just a few 100s of auxiliary matrices, you can get a reasonable result. But the way we have the code in QuTiP now pre-computes the `L` and gets stuck due to memory limitations. @agpitch Thanks for the suggestions. I am trying to make the HEOM work without building the `L`. Perhaps I will still run into memory issues if I try to initialize the full set of `p` but if the dynamic filtering approach works out, then I can escape the memory problem by only building a few of the `p`'s and deciding to append them or not based on some conditions.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/831#issuecomment-368980965:171,simpl,simple,171,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/831#issuecomment-368980965,1,['simpl'],['simple']

Usability,"Hi,; The documentation is not clear for this and propagator is a little strange for `t`. Propagator uses the `t` as a list the same way `tlist` is used by `sesovle` or `mesolve` and those solver support continuing an evolution:; ```; H = [op1, [op2, f]]; res1 = qutip.sesolve(H, psi0, tlist=[0,1,2,3,4]); res2 = qutip.sesolve(H, res1.states[-1], tlist=[4,5,3,7,8]); ```; So if `tlist` is a list with one element, it does no evolution and the propagator is 1 (`qeye`). If you were to compute propagators with `tlist` with 3 or more elements, you would receive a list of propagator and the first one would always be 1. I am not sure where or if it is documented that evolution starts at the first element of the list of time, not at zero.

Usability,"Hi. Thanks for reporting this problem. I'm not sure if I'd call it a bug or not, but I understand that this behavior can be a bit confusing. With odeOpts.rhs_reuse = True the same function will be use until rhs_clear() is called, which in your case would be. qtp.rhs_clear(); qtp.propagator([H0, [Hint, '1-w*t']], 5, [], {'w':1/5.}, opt=odeOpts). when yo change the time-dependency function strings. . Maybe this needs to be emphasized more in the documentation, or perhaps rhs_clear() could be called automatrically from within propagator, but this could prevent one from really reusing the rhs function for several propagators with the same rhs function (for example with different H0 or Hint). .

Usability,"Hmmm. You're right that there will be some nasty merge conflicts with #1181, but I don't see anyway around those, to be honest without that PR being merged before this one (which doesn't look very likely). Barring #1181 getting merged in the next day or two, I'd just go ahead with these commits as written. If the new-style tests were merged, `test_gates.py` would have a much tinier diff. The single-qubit gates would just go between lines 222 and 223 in https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/77c21f8a97ddfff2353490d3587cc1effdfe9abc/qutip/tests/test_gates.py#L222-L239 as; ```python; pytest.param(gates.x_gate, 0, ""X""),; pytest.param(gates.y_gate, 0, ""Y""),; ...; ```; (and we'd probably change the function name to `test_one_qubit`).

Overall, it's clear that you can't write sensible new-style tests without #1181 having been merged, so I wouldn't worry about it too much. I did drop in a couple of comments in-line (minor nitpicking), but given that this file may well get pretty much overwritten - keeping the actual tests, of course! - in short order, I wouldn't consider them changes that need to be made, unless Boxi asks. Also, as you noted, `test_gates.py` doesn't really do much testing of the actual form of the gates yet.

Usability,"I added a section to the test suite that will skip the tests if pyopencl is not installed in the last commit. To get them working, installing pyopencl via pip will not be sufficient. There are nice guides for setting up OpenCL in [Gentoo](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/OpenCL) and [Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GPGPU#OpenCL). But most OpenCL implementations are proprietary. I found an example of installing AMDAPP in a travis vm [here](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/OpenCL.jl/blob/master/.travis.yml). This is the OpenCL implementation I would recommend in absence of a GPU. But this script circumvents the license agreement and I am not sure whether this is legal. If you still intent to set this up, you can push changes to this branch as well. As for documentation I feel there is not much to document.

Usability,I agree with @jakelishman's general principle (and maybe we should even move the tests out of the `qutip` package for v5 still) but it's also really important to have an easy way for data layer implementations to run a comprehensive test suite *that is defined by the data layer*. I suspect that if anyone is running tests against master (i.e. what is currently dev.major) they will *want* tests to break if we add new methods. I have a slightly different proposal:. What if we create `qutip.core.data.testing` which is an explicitly exported suite of pytest classes that we intentionally expose for data layers to use? Initially the file can just import test classes from `qutip.tests.core.data`. I would also not use `__all__` in the individual test packages but instead import the test classes explicitly in `qutip.core.data.testing` so that it's 100% clear by reading just that file what the exported interface is (and adding new tests requires explicitly adding them into the exposed package).,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-979884874:855,clear,clear,855,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1723#issuecomment-979884874,1,['clear'],['clear']

The problem is clearly in the fact that you compute the fidelity of ket states by converting them into density matrices and using the general formula:; https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/564c987bdca385ae179730d0aad7b0d1e624e14d/qutip/metrics.py#L88-L113. This is fine in general, but can be very inefficient for large states, and is less numerically stable. An easy solution is to just compute the fidelity as the inner product when both states are kets. Moreover, the general formula might also be improvable: consider the following example (which uses the variables defined in the previous snippet):. ```; final_dm = qutip.ket2dm(final_state); target_dm = qutip.ket2dm(target_state); sqrt_final_dm = final_dm.sqrtm(); sqrt_target_dm = target_dm.sqrtm(); eig_vals = (sqrt_final_dm * target_dm * sqrt_final_dm).eigenenergies(); bad_fid = np.sqrt(eig_vals[eig_vals > 0]).sum(). prod_sqrt = (sqrt_final_dm * sqrt_target_dm); better_fid = scipy.linalg.svdvals(prod_sqrt.full()).sum(). print('bad fid: {}'.format(bad_fid)); print('better fid: {}'.format(better_fid)). # bad fid: 1.000000072436338; # better fid: 0.9999999999",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/925#issuecomment-542318121:895,clear,clearly,895,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/925#issuecomment-542318121,1,['clear'],['clearly']
Usability,"I also note that I'm not replying to the thread I thought I was - I thought I was in `krotov`! For my response to the discussion points:; - I think the function `qutip.mesolve` shouldn't change interface at all for 5.0 - we can change its backend, but I think it'll be a huge hindrance to adoption of 5.0 if we make major breaking changes to effectively our premier function, and I don't see a need to do that. We can add, rather than change, and keep `mesolve` as the ""quick-and-dirty"" method that just works.; - I'm in favour of exposing the different parts of the `mesolve` process as user-accessible, composable chunks. So something like exposing a `mesolve_prepare_ode(H, state, c_ops) -> OdeState` function, where `OdeState` has properties `rhs: QobjEvo`, `state: Qobj`, `time: float` (`sesolve_prepare_ode` and `mcsolve_prepare_ode` would presumably return the same object, or a derived object). Then we'd have an `Integrator` class, which encapsulates an integration step using whatever integrator of choice, so there's one that encapsulates the scipy integrator, one which is a Cython-ised RK4 implementation, etc. Then the low-level user would simply write the `for time in times` loop themselves; at this level, there's nothing fancy that QuTiP adds, so we may as well just expose it directly.

Usability,"I am on the side on having 2 `default_dtype` options for the `Qobj` creation functions. I have some question as to how/where to make `default_dtype` more consistent. Applying the default at Qobj creation feels risky to me. In the solver it will end up converting the states before computing the expectation value. It could create strange interactions with operators and unitary transformations (`Qobj[Dense].dag() -> Qobj[CSR]`). `Qobj(scipy_csr)` could be converted to something else... However if `default_dtype` can be seen as _running in that mode_, it certainly could cause confusion.; It's not clear how it is understood in some places. In `eigenstates`, if we run in `CSR` mode, then does that mean that we use the sparse eigen solver? It's a lot worst than the dense one. Or should only the returned ket be in CSR format? . In my tries, the dense steadystate was faster that the sparse one. Could it be an issue that some matrices where too big to fit in RAM forcing to use swap space? We could have a warning when matrices over a certain size are allocated. ps. Should `eigenstates` return the states in one operator instead of a list of kets?

Usability,"I completely agree with you that random tests really aren't the right way to go in general, but right now our problem is that basically QuTiP's entire testing suite is based on randomised tests, and that's an awful lot of technical debt to overcome any time soon :(. . The `dnorm` tests have historically been a huge problem, even though basically nobody's worked on `dnorm` for a long long time now (for context, see in particular #880 and #874). We don't actually even know if the failures in `dnorm` are deterministic and reproducible, although it turns out that I had a brief look into this when I joined as a GSoC student about a year ago... I don't remember doing it at all!. I know this is super inelegant and not the perfect method, but it's kind of a nasty trade-off - I don't have time to really dig into `dnorm` (a topic I know almost nothing about) to work out an appropriate solution to temperamental errors, we do want `dnorm` to be tested since we're shipping it, and the slight flakiness keeps causing us test suite failures about 1 in 10 times. I'm somewhat opposed to fixing the random seed because having the variance over several test runs does actually help us cover more ground (eventually) - fixing it to a ""known good"" seed actually seems to me to be more of a mask of potential problems than this. Of note: the pytest plugin I'm using reports the number of reruns it performed in the analysis at the bottom - they show up in a yellow alongside the ""skips"" and ""xfails"" - so it's not completely hidden. I'd love to have a property-based testing suite like hypothesis up and running - that definitely seems like the proper solution to this in the end. In the meantime, I'm open to swapping to a fixed random seed if you think that's much better - testing is one place where I'm really aware of my lack of formal experience in software engineering, so I'm basically just learning as I go.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1490#issuecomment-815317227:1893,learn,learning,1893,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1490#issuecomment-815317227,1,['learn'],['learning']

Usability,"I do not think it's a _good first issue_...; There are multiple possible solutions and it is not clear which is the best one:. 1. Ensure all eigen values and eigen vectors are computed.; 1.1 This could be done by finding an alternative to scipy to solve for sparse matrix decomposition, but it would add extra requirement and it must be easy to install with pip.; 1.2 Use a third call to `scipy.sparse.linalg.eigs`/ `scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh` using `sigma` to find all the pseudo degenerate values. It need to be done while being careful about special cases. This would make the sparse eigen solver even slower than it already is.; 2. Allow to sort by other orders, such as the complex value or magnitude. This would not solve the issue, but give some options to go around it. However the dense eigen solver would be expected to behave the same and the dense eigen solver does not have this options, so we need to implement it ourselves. This sorting option would also be required for any other data type we want to support. To go around that, the `Qobj` methods could be responsible for the sorting, the `sort` argument would only be passed to the dispatched function when `sparse=True`.; 3. Refuse to use the sparse solver for the full decomposition as scipy does. The sparse eigensolver is both slow and hard to use in this case. Also the eigen vectors computed by the sparse solver are stored in a dense array, so it is not that useful to save memory...; 4. Implement our own sparse eigen decomposition...; 5. Only document the issue without fixing. The default is the dense solver, which is both faster and safer in almost all cases.; 6. Something else...; ; I would personally go for either 1.2 of 3. ; Adding different sorting options in `Qobj` methods (2) and removing them from the dispatched functions, could be nice, but it's not a fix.

Usability,"I don't have xvfb (pytest-xvfb) installed specifically for qutip, but it is used by other packages (The general use of pytest-xvfb is to facilitate testing of GUI, graphical or windowing functionality without having an normal Xserver active. That is, it can be useful for automated CI testing of gui packages, for instance in chroots or cloud CI infrastructure). Since qutip doesn't use xvfb directly this bug won't be a problem for general CI testing, where only qutip is loaded on a cloud instance (for instance Debian testing done at https://ci.debian.net/packages/q/qutip/). But before I upload a package to the Debian infrastructure, I like to run the tests on my own system to be confident they're likely to pass. So this is where the problem happens, running tests on my own system, where I have pytest-xvfb installed for testing other packages. (pytest has this bad habit of loading all available plugins whether or not they're actually used by the tests being run. It's quite annoying actually. It would be better if it only loaded plugins specified in conftest.py). So the use case is running the qutip tests on my own system, where pytest-xvfb simply happens to be installed for other purposes not related to qutip. There are ways of working around the problem, for instance the `--no-xvfb` option could be explicitly added to the `pytest` command line. But it can be useful if the test code itself can be made robust with respect to the problem (e.g. in this case just replacing `plt.clf()` with `plt.close('all')`)",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1639#issuecomment-909115791:1155,simpl,simply,1155,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1639#issuecomment-909115791,1,['simpl'],['simply']
Usability,"I don't think it breaks the functional API at all - in fact it almost makes it stronger, since everything is a ""function"" at every stage. This kind of partial application is classic part of functional programming. Perhaps I don't understand _why_ you want to move to a class-based API? I'd be quite strongly against having the user have to instantiate classes to do very simple parts like creating operators. Certainly in Python programming, I don't think a class-based interface is de facto the right sort to aim for, and procedural is much more ""Pythonic"". For one, it's a lot of unnecessary boilerplate for simple operations. It adds cognitive complexity for the advanced user to decide ""should I use `displace` or `Displacer`?"", and in the strong majority of use-cases, the operator creation is not a computational bottleneck so we'd be adding it for no gain. A lot of operators have no meaningful reason to live in a class, like `sigmax` and so on, so now you have a split between operators that need a class and operators that don't, or you do something really crazy like requiring the user to do; ```python; sx_builder = qutip.operators.SigmaX(); sx = sx_builder.get_operator(); sy_builder = qutip.operators.SigmaY(); sy = sy_builder.get_operator(); sz_builder = qutip.operators.SigmaZ(); sz = sz_builder.get_operator(); ```; when all they wanted was `qutip.sigmax(), qutip.sigmay(), qutip.sigmaz()`. Obviously that example is a bit facetious, but what benefit does the user derive from having to write boilerplate to access simple functionality?. All the operators already share a class in `Qobj`, and things like `displace` and `sigmax` are factory methods of `Qobj`. What shared functionality do the factory methods possess that means they should be classes?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1293#issuecomment-646631332:371,simpl,simple,371,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1293#issuecomment-646631332,3,['simpl'],['simple']

Usability,"I ended up closing this PR because the implementation needs a significant overhaul. Now that I understand the code better it's clear that the pulse generation classes are intended to produce a single specific pulse and not a set of pulses for each control. The current implementation attempts to do the latter, resulting in having to pass the control index as an (very hacky) input to all the pulse methods. In other parts of control module, the former approach of a list of pulse instances is already taken, so this PR also results in both the ""correct"" and the ""hacky"" approach being used.

Usability,"I still vote for keeping it as it is, because I think it makes sense to keep Qobj \* Qobj in the space of Qobj. This is now numpy.ndarray, numpy.matrix and scipy,sparse.spmatrix works, and I think that one would expect Qobj to do the same. A simple example: imagine you get a Qobj x as an argument to a function, and you do some computation like x.dag() \* op \* x with some operator op. If x is a ket you will get a Python complex as a result with your suggested behavior. But if x is an operator instead you will get a Qobj. Or if x is a tensor of an operator and a ket (like in the top of this issue) you will get something in between, a reduced dimensionality operator. I think it makes a lot more sense to keep the results of all these cases as Qobj. Then if one for example want to do the trace of the result it should work in all cases, and no special handing of C-numbers would be required since Qobj([1]).tr() would give something reasonable, but (Python complex).tr() would obviously fail.

Usability,"I think `hypothesis` is the best method here in the long term, but it will most likely have to be a long-term goal. I think the main pro in favour of it is that it actually is making an attempt to remove randomness; it's attempting to comprehensively test a spanning set of input parameters, rather than just Monte-Carlo'ing our way through and hoping. There's a couple of points which make it difficult to implement:. 1. QuTiP can be quite fragile with respect to unexpected input formats, particularly in older parts of the code.; 2. Various components are only accurate up to some tolerance, and the error propagation to work out how that corresponds to useful measurable quantities can be rather tricky. Those are certainly both solvable problems, and point 1 in particular is just general improvement of usability. The second point is about designing the tests well, which again is certainly doable, but will take a while (it takes long enough just to refactor them, let alone a total rewrite of large chunks of them!).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-629272663:809,usab,usability,809,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-629272663,1,['usab'],['usability']

Usability,"I think you might be able to achieve a lot of what you want already. The pseudo-code looks like it's not using `mesolve` super efficiently, though maybe it's only because of simplifications to make a MWE. For example, if your controls are piecewise constant, then it might be inefficient to represent those terms as ""time dependent""; doing so means you incur the cost of multiplying each term by a scalar at every intermediate step the integrator chooses to take, then you have to perform the matrix-vector product for each one individually and add them up. It might be faster already if you evaluate the piecewise varying parts into one ""constant"" part at each point. This isn't guaranteed, because it involves copying rather more data _before_ the call (to construct the constant matrix once), but if the integrator would need to take many intermediate time steps, I expect it would win out.

That fixed it, but I'm not sure how that affects the H1_coeff function. Is it as simple as including a (w-w0) term there as well, or do I need to adjust it some other way?

The pre-compiled pip/conda releases could be `int64`. That might be a simple way to provide some support for ""both"". Somehow, I thought that SciPy would put a lot more emphasis on performance, and do things like Kronecker products without conversion. It would seem that SciPy should be the place to really optimize the sparse linear algebra implementation, including all the possible combinations like `CSR * DIA`. Then everyone could build on top of that, making custom sparse-matrix implementation unnecessary. Maybe when someone gets some serious funding for working on QuTiP, encapsulating all of this better would be doable. So, just something to keep in mind before bolting on too many things onto the existing custom implementation (like multiple sparse and full storage formats). Once you open up that can of worms, it just might be better to re-design `Oobj.data` to have a very broad base (e.g. SciPy), and keep the custom CSR as an optional, highly efficient implementation for the special case, maybe in a separate package.

Usability,"I was just thinking about this again and came up with a good speed up for the truncated Hilbert space. I can't think of any method to get analytic closed-form solutions for the truncated space, though, so this is just a more efficient numerical method. First we take the generator of the displacement operator `G`, such that `exp(G)` is the displacement operator we're looking for. `G` is anti-Hermitian, and so it shares its eigensystem (up to scaling of the eigenvalues) with the Hermitian `i G` and consequently is diagonalised by a unitary formed of its eigenvectors. Now `S = i G / abs(alpha)` is a tridiagonal Hermitian, and with a similarity transformation we can find a _real-symmetric_ tridiagonal `T = P^-1 . S . P` for some diagonal unitary `P` (which is easy to calculate). The reason for scaling out `alpha` here should become clear at the end. The main diagonal of `T` is all zeros, and the first sub- and super-diagonals look like; ```[sqrt(1), -sqrt(2), sqrt(3), -sqrt(4), ...]```; and the diagonal of `P` looks like; ```[i, e^(-1i arg(alpha)), i e^(-2i arg(alpha)), e^(-3i arg(alpha)), ...]```. Now this real-symmetric tridiagonal form is the basis of Hermitian eigenvalue solvers, and has direct entry points in LAPACK (e.g. `?stemr`), which allow us to pass only the main diagonal and the first subdiagonal. Scipy provides convenient wrapped access in Python by `scipy.linalg.eigh_tridiagonal`. This lets us get the full eigensystem of `T`, which is related to that of `G` by dividing the eigenvalues by the scaling factor, and multiplying the eigenvectors by `P` to transform them into the correct basis. We now have a diagonalised matrix `G = Q^-1 . D . Q`, so `exp(G) = Q^-1 . exp(D) . Q`, which is now trivial because `D` is diagonal. Putting all this together allows us to use our knowledge of the problem domain to convert the matrix exponentiation problem into a much simpler real-symmetric tridiagonal eigensystem problem, which gets us a nice big speed up, and it's equival",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1293#issuecomment-645685030:840,clear,clear,840,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1293#issuecomment-645685030,1,['clear'],['clear']

Usability,"I'll add that it might be worth addressing the fact that there are two common conventions for representing quantum states as tensors that each have their pros and cons. Perhaps this would be better placed in a separate issue, but I'll explain here anyway. Consider a joint state like $` |\psi_1 \psi_2 \rangle \langle \psi_3 \psi_4 | `$ where the dimensions of $` |\psi_i\rangle `$ are $` d_i `$. Two common representations of this abstract state as a tensor are; 1. $` (|\psi_1\rangle \otimes |\psi_2\rangle) \otimes (\langle \psi_3| \otimes \langle \psi_4|) `$, which has shape $`(d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4)`$; 2. $` (|\psi_1\rangle \otimes \langle \psi_3|) \otimes (|\psi_2\rangle \otimes \langle \psi_4|) `$, which has shape $` (d_1, d_3, d_2, d_4) `$. These two conventions essentially correspond to the ""super"" and ""choi"" representations for channels. Representation 1. is nice when you are doing most of your calculations with pure states, but then want a density matrix towards the end, which you can do with just `np.tensordot(my_ket_tensor, np.conj(my_ket_tensor), 0)`. Representation 2. is nice when you are working with density matrices and want to combine multiple subsystems, which you can do with `np.tensordot(my_density_tensor_1, my_density_tensor_2, 0)`. Doing either of these operations in the other representation involves very error-prone index permutation in my experience. When I said above that these two conventions should be ""addressed"" in some way, I was intentionally vague because I'm honestly not sure what the best way to do that would be. One option would be to simply mention it in the user guide somewhere, perhaps near the section on the Super and Choi representations. Another would be to support both conventions via optional parameters like `to_tensor_rep(my_qobj, convention='super')` or `to_tensor_rep(my_qobj, convention='choi')`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2353#issuecomment-2007183867:1587,simpl,simply,1587,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2353#issuecomment-2007183867,2,"['guid', 'simpl']","['guide', 'simply']"

Usability,"I'm sorry I don't have a huge amount of time at the moment, but just to add an extra point (that it looks like I didn't think about before): if we _do_ add this, then any method that requires an unconditional `import qutip` in downstream packages probably isn't a suitable solution - `import qutip` already takes far too long (though a lot of this is importing various parts of `scipy`, which another library might do on our behalf), and it means that they'd have to do their own import checking to handle optional dependencies. In that sense, (ab)using Python's duck-typing with a magic method might be the best way to break the dependency/import problem. I'm definitely still against implicit conversion to `Qobj` in pretty much any situation - I can imagine we could define a safe, fairly forward-compatible interface for letting people do `qutip.Qobj(x)`, but as it stands, that's the limit that I'd want the interface to be used for. I particularly am really against the idea of implicit conversion. I don't see an advantage to allowing QuTiP functions to act implicitly on other objects; it means our own functions are slower (because we have to explicitly test inputs on _everything_), and it restricts us more from improving `Qobj`'s internals, because we have to maintain compatibility with the interface. We'd never really be able to output anything _other_ than a `Qobj` without this, so there's no reason not to just have the user convert the inputs to `Qobj` explicitly themselves - that isolates the efficiency penalty so you only pay it if you need it, and it'll likely be clearer in the end anyway, because explicit is better for following the logic than implicit.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-908380301:1588,clear,clearer,1588,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-908380301,1,['clear'],['clearer']

Usability,"I've had a thorough look. Simplifying the SolverOptions class is an excellent idea, but I think the PR currently doesn't go far enough and ends up with the solver classes, the integrator classes and the solver option classes required to share too much internal state with each other. As a next step to try untangle things, I suggest the following:. - Let's remove the `known_solvers` and the solver `name` from the SolverOptions and instead have the base solver pass the allowed options with defaults in to the SolverOptions constructor directly. If the allowed options list is `None`, then we can allow all options (for the convenience of users who really want to make their own SolverOptions instances).; - Having the options able to notify a listener of changes seems great -- let's keep that.; - When a solver is created, let's have the base solver create a new SolverOptions instance, either from a dictionary or another SolverOptions instance, but with the allowed options and defaults now specified.; - To deal with the integrator options, let's go back to having a single option named `ode`, but have the value of `ode` have type `SolverOptions`, and be a child of the solver options (if the child has a value modified, it should notify the parent of the change).; - For convenience, when passing options as a dictionary, one should be able to use `{""ode.method"": ""vern9""}` or `{""ode"": {""method"": ""vern9""}`. I think that should be enough to disentangle things from each other. The base solver would need to update the integrator if integrator options change and deal with any changes to the base options. It's not completely clear to me whether the result options should also be sub-options or just be included in the solver options. I'm happy for them to be included in the solver options, as long as the solver options are passed to the result class constructor.

A simple call like that changing ""global"" state of the object is dangerous; it has a habit of leaking out even in single-threaded applications, just like the bug I described previously with a call to `mesolve` modifying an existing `QobjEvo` in place. In this case I don't see an immediate bug, but it's very non-obvious behaviour and it would be easy to accidentally introduce one in it in the future (or maybe I just can't think of one now).

Usability,"In general in pytest we use the bare keyword `assert` for almost everything. All the functions in `np.testing` are from the ""before times"", when test tooling wasn't as good as it is nowadays - they were a big improvement on available warning messages back before 2015. Nowadays, though, `pytest` does introspection on assertion failures, so it has even better message reporting than the `np.testing` functions, and it lets you write much clearer code. For example, `assert_equal(x, y)` is much better spelled in pytest as `assert x == y`, because it's much faster to read and pytest does better error reporting for it. Similarly, testing for exceptions is better with; ```python; with pytest.raises(ValueError):; call_that_raises(1, ""hello, world""); ```; as opposed to the numpy form `np.testing.assert_raises(ValueError, call_that_raises, 1, ""hello, world"")` - the pytest one is much easier to read, and the error message is better.

That's just because `pytest` doesn't have a good function that's aware of multidimensional arrays (at least not one that I know). This file still has a load of old numpy testing code in it (e.g. `np.testing.assert_equal`) because it was written quite a long time ago, when that was the recommended way of doing things. We're changing over slowly, so we can take advantage of all the nice features of pytest. In this case, I changed `np.testing.assert_allclose(x, y, atol=tol)` to `assert abs(x - y) < tol`. I removed `np.testing.assert_allclose`, because that gives the mistaken impression that we're comparing arrays (we're not, we're comparing two scalars). I could have changed it to `assert x == pytest.approx(y, tol=tol)`, except in this case the test file hasn't been converted to `pytest` style yet, and I wanted to keep the total change of this PR as small as possible.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1498#issuecomment-822737671:438,clear,clearer,438,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1498#issuecomment-822737671,1,['clear'],['clearer']

Usability,"In theory the `correlation_2op_1t` function is only valid when you pass in the steady state solution of the Liouvillian. However, we implement it just by calculating `<A(t) B(0)>` - it's not _immediately_ clear to me that that our output is necessarily correct when you don't pass in a steadystate (especially if `taulist` doesn't start from 0). I _think_ it's fine in all cases, but perhaps Neill you can check me on that front?. I'd agree with Neill that truncation of the thermal state basis is likely the reason you were failing to get that to work exactly right. The tolerance calculation will actually be a bit more involved because QuTiP returns a normed dm. That will cause all the values to shift by relatively the same amount, and then you've got to factor in the solver tolerance on top of those errors, but the principle is correct for sure. *edit*: I'm happy and ready to merge this, but I'll just hold off for a day or so in case Neill has chance to answer my last minor query.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1478#issuecomment-815021669:205,clear,clear,205,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1478#issuecomment-815021669,1,['clear'],['clear']

Usability,"It seems to work now (the failing test is unrelated). I will briefly summarize what I found out and changed. Setting up and using an MPI environment is surprisingly difficult, and I don't think it is in the scope of qutip to try and make that easier, or guide users to do that. The philosophy here is, if the user can get the `mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor` to work, then they can also use `mpi_pmap` in qutip. However, I did show in the tutorial notebook explicitly as an example how it works on the RIKEN cluster, and I refer to the mpi4py users guide. That being said, we do want to set up an automated test for this, and we do want to understand what went wrong in our initial attempts to set up those tests. The two main problems we encountered were (a) if mpi4py is installed with pip, all mpi_pmap calls hang; (b) if it is installed with conda, test_map_pass_error hangs sometimes.; The difference between pip and conda comes from the fact that mpi4py requires an MPI implementation. If we use mpi4py's GH workflow to install it with pip, it installs MPICH, and with conda, it installs OpenMPI by default. I noticed that in both cases where mpi_pmap hangs, there *are* error messages, but they are captured by pytest and then never printed because the program hangs... Regarding problem (a), in short, it looks like an MPICH bug to me. I thus decided to use OpenMPI instead, and added `conda install ""openmpi<5"" mpi4py` to just one of our test runs (the python 3.12 one). Regarding problem (b), the problem was that we requested more processes than the default number of slots available. With OpenMPI, the default number of slots available is the number of physical cpu cores (which seems to be 2 on the machine running our tests, leaving only one slot for a worker process). In the `parallel` module, if num_cpus is not provided, it defaults to `available_cpu_count()` (which is 4 on this machine, since there are 4 logical cpus). We could try to find a better default value for num_cpus for ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2296#issuecomment-1923102432:254,guid,guide,254,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2296#issuecomment-1923102432,2,['guid'],['guide']

Usability,"Looking at our algorithm, it does seem a bit questionable for positive-definite matrices, but to be fair, what constitutes sufficiently random? The eigenvalues being chosen on the interval (0, 1] is also pretty arbitrary. When you start throwing in extra constraints like ""matrix density"" and ""positive-definite"", it becomes difficult to sample a useful measure that has an intuitive definition of random. We're certainly not against improving the algorithm if you've got ideas, though. The current algorithm (noted in the docstring) is ""diagonal dominance"" - basically we add extra stuff onto the diagonal to ensure that the eigenvalues end up all positive. That's why you see them getting bigger as the dimension increases. To some degree, it's the intended behaviour. @hodgestar: this is specifically about positive-definite matrices, and supplying eigenvalues is incompatible with that (though perhaps that's a bug!). It shouldn't be too difficult to make that work by messing around with the Cholesky decomposition, but that would be hard to get right with respect to the density.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1642#issuecomment-905696188:374,intuit,intuitive,374,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1642#issuecomment-905696188,1,['intuit'],['intuitive']
Usability,"Looking into the issue in more detail, I think that the documentation wasn't just misleading but wrong: because QuTiP uses the column-stacking notation, the order of `dims` for `type='super'` doesn't have the same meaning as for `type='oper'` or for vectors. In particular, the column-stacking basis maps |i><j| to |j> |i>, such that the order of the tensor indices for superoperators is swapped from the ordering `[left, right]` that is used by QuTiP's `dims` notation. I'll break this out into another Issue, but I think the simplest way of handling it is to keep `dims` the same as it is now (I don't want to break that, for crying out loud), but to transform the arguments to `_tensor_contract_dense` if the order of `dims` doesn't match the order that we need to pass to `np.reshape`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/385#issuecomment-152462241:527,simpl,simplest,527,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/385#issuecomment-152462241,1,['simpl'],['simplest']

In principle you could put this progress bar in a separate module and still use it with qutip (as long as it supports qutip's basic progressbar interface). Then it could also be used in non-qutip related projects. . If its to be included in qutip, I think it should not be added to qutip/ui/progressbar, but as an module of its own that would not be loaded by default, so a user would have to load it explicitly when using it, like the way the current ipynbtools and picloud modules work. . Perhaps it would make sense to move these ""extras"" or ""extensions"" modules to a subdirectory of their own, say ""qutip/extensions"" or ""qutip/ext"" to keep the import paths manageable. In that case I think that qutip.picloud should be moved to that directory as well.

Usability,"Most of it is already in qutip or in development:; - We already have a progress bar.; - We have feedback to support solvers where parameters are changed depending on the current state.

Usability,"My thinking on this basically comes down to two points. First, the behavior of `composite` is explicitly not the same as that of `tensor()` or `super_tensor()`, as it's a common usecase to compose operators defined on different subsystems without reference to representation. While I agree that it would be good to have more generic wire-bending support in QuTiP, I think that's likely out of scope for this particular feature, as it would require some significant rethinking of how `dims` is currently implemented. Second, I think that it's entirely defensible that the current behavior of `composite` promotes operators by `spre() * spost()`, as this is consistent with the view that superoperators are matrix representations of group action by conjugation. That is, `composite` returns the composite of the same group action applied to each of several subsystems, though the action can be more general for `type='super'` arguments. This could perhaps be made more clear by renaming `composite` to `composite_oper` or similar, but I think that the _behavior_ of the current function is correct and consistent, if admittedly, poorly described.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/241#issuecomment-58038276:967,clear,clear,967,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/241#issuecomment-58038276,1,['clear'],['clear']

The only use I personally see from this would be case like:; ```; out = qzero(dims); for i in range(N):; out += f(i, dims); ```; Cases were the qobj is more of a dummy variable than a physical operator. `coherent` and `create` have a physical meaning and I would not know what `coherent([2,10])` is supposed to be, but I understand what `tensor(coherent(2), coherent(10))` is. For `projector`, it could be added, it's meaning is clear. To make it consistent, removing the list support from `qeye`, etc. and fixing the few case that it is used, might be a better option.

Usability,"No, my Hamiltonian does not have a lot of zeros but it has fast oscillating term cos (omega(t)*t) where omega(t) is a non-analytic term and is a very large number compared to the 1/final time. So, to get the correct result, I have to use a large number of time_grid. I suspect the method of using QobjEvo that was suggested above only use two time steps (initial and final time) in evolving the Hamiltonian as the seed and interpolate the Hamiltonian at the time between the initial and final time using some interpolation function. This will not give the correct result since my Hamiltonian has fast oscillating terms which requires a lot of time steps to be given as an input for mesolve. This is why the method of using QobjEvo gives different answer than if I use my initial time grid (which is time grid = 1000000) in the mesolve. . Since I am using a very large time grid in mesolve, my program ran very slowly. I would like to speed up my simulation by having mesolve to evaluate the expectation value of the operator only at the final time and not at all time steps. My question is very simple: Is there a way that I can still use a very large time grid in evolving my Hamiltonian using mesolve but have the mesolve evaluating the expectation value of the operator ONLY at the final time? If not, is it possible to add this feature in qutip?.

Usability,"Note: in theory you can install QuTiP from the test PyPI server right now by doing; ```; pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple qutip-jakelishman; ```; (that's just the name - you still do `import qutip`) but since it's on the ""wrong"" server, you first have to manually install `numpy` and `scipy`. When it's released properly on PyPI it'll handle the dependencies correctly - this is only an artifact of being on the testing server. Running that command will install a binary version with no compilation, and should work on any (reasonable) Linux machine, Mac (possibly not M1 chips) and Windows. It's possible you may get an error about `ndarray size changed ... this may indicate binary incompatibility` - if so, either force `numpy` up to the new 1.20 or down to 1.19 (whichever one you don't have). This was a breaking change in numpy 1.20. Per my reading of the release notes, it won't be an issue provided in the future we always build against `numpy>=1.20` (even when using lower `numpy` at runtime) because the new version updates a certain C-API macro to take into account the possibility of runtime variability. I have pushed an additional change to the build requirements to ensure this always happens. This has another knock-on effect: numpy 1.20 only supports Python 3.7+ (released June 2017). Currently, officially QuTiP supports Python 3.6, but I think it's reasonable to follow numpy's footsteps and **drop support for python 3.6 from qutip 5.0**. It's offset by gaining support for 3.9.

Sure, you may also be able to use `Cubic_Spline`, but if we punish you for using arrays by swapping your options, why do we provide them? I think we should only warn and change the settings if _nothing_ is going to be stored - `store_final_state` should be enough to suppress it and not store the intermediate states, even if that implies the user might not be doing the fastest possible thing.

Usability,"Ok, it turns out I got the numpy release notes the wrong way round; we have to build our binaries with `1.16.6 <= numpy < 1.20` to maintain ABI compatibility no matter the numpy version.

This is ready for final review. If you're fast, you can also try installing from the test PyPI server to see if the wheels work for you.

The pseudo-code looks like it's not using `mesolve` super efficiently, though maybe it's only because of simplifications to make a MWE. For example, if your controls are piecewise constant, then it might be inefficient to represent those terms as ""time dependent""; doing so means you incur the cost of multiplying each term by a scalar at every intermediate step the integrator chooses to take, then you have to perform the matrix-vector product for each one individually and add them up. That's certainly worth trying: when calling `mesolve` in a loop over the time grid, I did indeed see a significant speedup when summing the Lindbladian into a single constant `Qobj`, see `In [21]` vs `In [24]`. On the other hand, it doesn't always give a speedup: in the low-level [`DensityMatrixODEPropagator`](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/propagators.py#L162) it actually makes the propagation slower, see `In [29]` vs `In [32]`. It's a bit surprising, but then, as you say:. > [...] This isn't guaranteed, because it involves copying rather more data _before_ the call. So that's ok. > Would something like this work for you?

Usability,"Ok, yeah, I definitely see the use-case here. I'll leave it removed from `matmul` for the time being because I hadn't really organised that code to allow safe calling of the function with an `out` parameter, but I'll look to re-instate it, similarly with `add`. For `add`: I envisage a nice possibility for `QobjEvo` using `CSR` backing along the vein of `CQobjEvoTdMatched`: on instantiation we add together all the matrices, then we `memset` all zeroes along the `data` array and store it as `self._structure`. Then each time we `__call__` the object, we simply do `out = self._structure.copy()`, and use that as the output matrix, because we guarantee we'll always have enough space and the correct structure.

Usability,"So, while I agree that having a flexible storage format is a good way to go, the truth of the matter is that no one has time to implement such a big change. SciPy supports both 32 and 64-bit ints, and checks to see which ones are needed at runtime. e.g. a tensor product of two sparse matrices with int32, may need int64 in the result since their shape is larger. We could also do a similar thing, but it is a lot of work. The reason why we no longer use standard SciPy sparse objects is: 1) They tend to have a sizeable overhead when being created and/or manipulated do to redundant safety checks. 2) Many of the sparse operations are not well optimized. Because SciPy supports many different sparse formats, they had to generalize many of their core operations, making them slower. For example, the sparse kronecker product first converts to COO format, does the tensoring, and then converts back to the original format. Our method is much faster. Supporting more than just the current CSR format is also problematic. As already mentioned, there would be type checks, conditionals, and format conversions everywhere. e.g. what happens when DIA * CSR. As usual, available time is the limiting factor here. Support for both int32 and int64 is not that hard, but would take some time. Just int64 would make smaller matrices larger, but would allow for much greater system dimensions. In this later case, it would be a simple switch `int` -> `int64` and `size_t` -> `uint64` in the Cython code, and the fastsparse module (plus probably other places.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/850#issuecomment-384005667:1417,simpl,simple,1417,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/850#issuecomment-384005667,1,['simpl'],['simple']

Although I'm not sure I understand how #1123 fits in: what is the plan for `Qobjevofunc`, and how would it fit in to specifying time-dependent Hamiltonians?. The only thing that's ever really bothered me was the mandatory `args` as part of the signature, even if it's not used. That's lead to the need for workarounds like the `allow_args` parameter in; https://github.com/qucontrol/qdynpylib/blob/f7b54af3e586683cdfd9b3dd666c5cf540d843e1/src/qdyn/pulse.py#L555.

In the abstract, `f(t, **args)` and `f(t, state_vec, **args)` would be the most elegant, but if there's a severe performance hit, that could be a problem. I'm surprised, though: I would have thought that `f(t, **args)` and `f(t, args)` should be almost the same thing in the Python internals, since you can modify `args` inside of `f` and pass it to lowerlevel function as `**args` again. Even from the user's perspective any current code with signature `f(t, args)` could have its signature replaced with `f(t, **args)` without requiring any change to the function body. But I'm clearly missing something. Can you point me to lines in the code where this becomes a bottleneck?. I'm also quite in favor of introspection to accept a wide variety of signatures: you can even introspect argument names, so the possibilities are endless.

Usability,"Thanks ! I have removed the table. . Couple of questions : . - What's the preferred method to link functions not in public API ? ; I could create a [sphinx reference label](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/domains.html#basic-markup) to link to these functions either by using Github's permalink or [a path to such functions in the directory](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html#the-doc-role). You can see this when I try to link `check_isunitary` which is not in the API but is defined in `Qobj` file in the linked branch. ; - Qobj vs qobj link : ; There are problems with linking functions for `Qobj` class. For example, if I want to link to [`isoperbra`](http://qutip.org/docs/latest/apidoc/functions.html#qutip.qobj.isoper) then the only link that will work is `qutip.qobj.isoperbra` not `qutip.Qobj.isoperbra`. If latter is preferred then I will have to create `ref` labels for each of these functions as stated above. More examples can be observed in the `superrep` attributes of `Qobj` class of linked branch.

In that case I think it would be Ok to simply fail to parse the config file if configobj is not available. I don't think many users use the config file so would be to worried about breaking backwards compatibility with respect to this.; - I think I'd prefer to have the logging module called logging.py rather than _logging.py even though it is supposed to internal to qutip. ; - Please add a `__all__` list in logging.py; - Shouldn't configspec.ini be added to the setup.py file?,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/248#issuecomment-61393881:348,simpl,simply,348,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/248#issuecomment-61393881,1,['simpl'],['simply']

That's a good point about the eigenstate problem.

But to do that, qutip would have to know the observable is simple so it could take advantage of the symmetries. Are there any flags I can give it to tip it off?

Usability,"Thanks for reporting this - it's an important bug that's snuck in. Right now, there's a few errors in your code that you can fix to get on your way again, but we need to fix the error on our side. You're using `sigmap()` which is the Pauli excitation operator and is only defined for a Hilbert space with dimension 2. You actually are working with a Hilbert space of dimension `nmax * nmax` (a tensor-product space), so your `e_ops` argument to `sesolve` is wrong - it's difficult to know exactly what you meant here. `destroy(2)` is equivalent to `sigmap()`, so it's possible you intended to have `e_ops` be `[qutip.tensor(a1, a2)]`?. ---. Maintainers: The error is actually a segfault, because QuTiP 4.5 (probably 4.4 too) does not do sufficient error checking on`e_ops` arguments - probably they're missing in the conversion to `CQobjEvo`. When the expectation is called, it has already sidestepped `Qobj`'s dimensions check and there is no matrix size check, so it simply segfaults on OOB access. The fix for the 4.x branch is to have a very loud Python-space error due to mismatched `Qobj` dimensions on entry to the solvers, or insert a size check within `CQobjEvo`. High priority: there's no reason we should be segfaulting here. Partially fixed in the 5.x branch; all matrix multiplications that take place in C-space have a size check and throw a Python exception, however the solvers still sidestep the `Qobj` dimension check so a tensor-product-space mismatch will not be detected.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1374#issuecomment-717495492:969,simpl,simply,969,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1374#issuecomment-717495492,1,['simpl'],['simply']

Regarding 1/2: ; In my code, using tuples does result in different behaviour. I cannot (so far) think of a good simple example to reproduce this though, and am hesitant to upload the full code in which I see the difference as it is work in progress. What I can say is that when looking at expectation values after running mesolve, the list-vs-tuple question seems to not matter, at least for the things I tend to look at. However, when using qt.correlations_2op_2t, the results are very drastically different, and it seems to me that using tuples actually gets results closer to what I would expect to see.

Usability,"Thanks for the useful feedback, both here and in PR #1611 ! From the discussion in PR #1611 it seems that the second option with the modifications proposed by Jake in this issue seems to be the most sensible approach. Hence, if there are no objections, I will open a PR (which I will probably do tomorrow) where I implement the following changes (adapted from Simon's comment in PR #1611):. - `Qobj.__mul__(self, other) ` ; - dispatch to `data.matmul` if `other` is a `Qobj`; - dispatch to `data.mul` otherwise which will return `NotImplemented` if it does not know how to handle `other`. ; - `Qobj.__rmul__(self, other) `:; - Dispatch to `data.mul` (`other` will never be a Qobj): Notice that in this way both left and right multiplication will behave in the same way. This would also ""solve"" the inconsistency PR #1611 was trying to solve but this time `data.mul` will handle it and will raise NotImplemented whenever required. . - `mul_dense` and `mul_csr`:; - Use a thin wrapper that returns `NotImplemeneted` if input is not a complex python scalar. There are a few things I would like to discuss before opening a PR:; 1) These changes will break backwards compatibility as:; ```python; matrix = np.random.random((2, 2)); qobj = qutip.Qobj(array). qobj * matrix # With the changes this also returns NotImplemented.; matrix * qobj # With the changes this also returns NotImplemented; ```; will now behave consistently (""fixes"" PR #1611). Is this acceptable? I would say yes given that we are doing a major version change. However, it may be a good idea to start raising a deprecation warning in QuTiP 4 if these changes go forward. 2) `data.add` has a similar behaviour to `data.mul` in that it accepts `scale` which is not a `Data` (there are a few more specialisations that also accept an argument that is not a `Data`). Should these specialisations behave in the same way allowing arbitrary python objects as ""scale"" and raise NotImplemented when required or should they just allow a complex py",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1607#issuecomment-883317473:22,feedback,feedback,22,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1607#issuecomment-883317473,1,['feedback'],['feedback']

Replace `.evolve_dm` with a `.unitary` attribute on the solver itself. The attribute should be `True` if that particular instance of the solver can guarantee that the evolution it produces is unitary, and `False` otherwise. This will be more generally useful and will simplify the code inside the propagator a bit. **For `.sys_dims`**:. The meaning of what `.sys_dims` returns is already unclear in this PR. The docstring says its the dimension of the system. Practically I assume that to mean ""the dimension of the initial state or dm passed to .run()"".

We already have some operators where `CSR` seems to the sensible default and others where the sensible default seems to be `Dia`. On the other hand eventually on probably wants to combine these operators into one system, so maybe picking a single operator default is the right thing to do.

Usability,"The main function of the `Options` class is to hold the documentation of the options supported by solver, mostly integrator related ones are an issue. Since sub-packages can add new integration methods, it should be somewhere dynamic that can fetch them at runtime. We can't have them in the description of the function interface directly, but it must be clear from that documentation where to find them.; We can't have them in the documentation of the solver class. It could be in a solver instance, but that too late: needing to initialize a `BrSolver` or `HEOMSolver` just to know which options `bsmesolve` and `heomsolve` support is not user friendly.; The Integrator class is useless for the users: if they want to solve ODE, they should use `scipy.integrate`, for quantum systems evolution, `mesolve` etc. So we should not ask them to look there. `SolverOptions(name)` make it reasonably easy to check the supported options and their default before using the solver. Another approach I see is to fix the integrator when using the functions interface, this way we could properly document the function with all items from both the solver and integrator. When using the class interface, we keep both options separated (and make the choice of integrator it's own keyword):; ```; solver = SeSolver(H, integrator_method='adams', options=solver_options, ode_options=ode_options); solver.options # Solver options only. solver.set_integrator('vern7', ode_options); help(solver.ode_options) # See description of integrator options; ```. That way the function calls is very close to v4 and easy to use, and the class interface give access to new features. ; This also makes `krylovsolve` fit more. Since `method` is used by the solver, not the integrator, it should not be under the `options.ode`, but it seems confusing to have it with the normal options, so having it as an independent parameter could make it clearer.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1947#issuecomment-1174438897:355,clear,clear,355,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1947#issuecomment-1174438897,2,['clear'],"['clear', 'clearer']"

The argument from Liouvillian doesn't work here - even before the new data layer, `liouvillian` never called the `tidyup` code because it accessed the `Qobj.data` field directly, rather than used `Qobj`. Since it then goes into `CQobjEvo` in most of the solvers, which also don't touch the `tidyup` code, it doesn't get called. I don't think there's any safe way to know if small values should actually be zero, or if they're just small values. It makes sense that we want to maintain as much sparsity as possible when values are truly zero, but I think having the QuTiP default be to attempt to tidy up after every addition, multiplication and matrix multiplication is quite unsafe, and for people who aren't doing very very sparse calculations, it's actually a slow down.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1349#issuecomment-680011384:347,clear,clearly,347,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1349#issuecomment-680011384,1,['clear'],['clearly']

This is slightly hacky, but very convenient, and usually `t=0` is a valid time. Feedback breaks this assumption though because now `t=0` is insufficient information. We also need the current state, but we can't create a dummy state because we don't know what its dims should be yet. So there is a cycle we have to break somehow. Currently we break this by having the user supply an initial state, but perhaps we could do other things. The worst case is when the Qobj part of an EvoElement is supplied by a function. Then we can't get the dims without calling it. When the Qobj part is just a Qobj, getting the dims is fairly straight forward. So one option would be to ask the user to supply the dims if there are no EvoElements that provide a Qobj to look at, or to guarantee that their function is callable with just `t=0`.

It's not using the data-layer correctly at all, and if we were to include it, we'd really want to do something like that in a more structured way in core QuTiP. Really it should be a properly dispatched implementation of `einsum`, but I think this should come in as part of a much larger discussion on how to handle tensor networks completely; to have it be nice and ergonomic in all cases, I think this will come in at the same time or after the introduction of new dimensions objects. I'm also very wary of introducing code to QuTiP which is licensed by a different holder.

Usability,"This is a style question.

If I'm not very familiar with qutip and I am reading the latter as part of some code, I could equally well think it means a number of different things, whereas the first use-case leaves very little room for confusion. Maybe I'm being a bit pedantic now, for this particular example, but I think it's a good idea to have discussions on style in general, and long term the code will benefit from being explicit, and also letting the user handle exceptions as much as possible. Anyway, we can agree or disagree on style, but you raise an interesting point regarding `dims`. I have actually always found `dims` a bit ""user unfriendly"".

Much of this I think is due to the Cython configurations, indeed the no-cython option takes only 13 minutes. My first suggestion would be to try without Cython if things speed up, from those requirements (@Ericgig set that up and I am not knowledgeable about it). . From your PR on `nixpkgs` do you build on Travis CI or a similar cloud? If you could give a list of time taken by the different tests that would help. . The idea of a subset of tests is interesting (essential tests vs. thorough tests), in general; for example thorough tests could be done only in production and a lighter version could be called with `qutip.testing.run()`.

As another work around I found that (after updating matplotlib to my current version) I can get some of the expected behaviour from b.show() within VS code by adding the `plt.pause(interval)` command after b.show() (as descibed previously however now I can actually render someting), where the interval is how many seconds I want to view the Bloch sphere for. The b.save() function also works as expected so I can use that as a workaround for now at least. Some more odd behaviour - likely caused by all the updating an reinstalling trying to fix things - is that the plt.show() no longer works as described before.

Usability,"We can in theory drop that requirement for users - it was there in the immediate aftermath of the Numpy 1.20 release, which broke C-ABI compatibility with previous versions, and we had a couple of problems with people building against Numpy 1.20 but trying to run against a prior version. Our CI and release versions will still all need to be built against Numpy 1.16 (or our minimum supported runtime Numpy) as the lowest common denominator until we drop support for all Numpy releases before 1.20, but we enforce that in our build pipelines anyway. Just to be clear (though I think you knew this):. > Can qutip be updated to run with current versions of Numpy?.

Usability,"We probably shouldn't mutate the given `Options` object, but the call as written here doesn't make a huge amount of sense - why would you want to run the integrator but not have any output stored at all?

There's also interplay with `store_final_state` here too; it's questionable technique to do `e_ops=None, store_final_state=True` with a `tlist` with more than two elements, but probably people who aren't familiar with `nsteps` will do something like that, and it seems a bit picky to prevent/warn on that when the intention seems clear. I think that the current behaviour doesn't take this case into account when falling back - it'll store all states, which in the 4.x branch is a fairly major time sink (but much much faster in 5.0).

I'd probably do something like:; 1. if we change the `Options`, we have to clone it first to prevent leaking our mutations; 2. if we're not going to save anything, we should warn the user but then do it anyway - maybe their time-dependence functions leak state, and they're just doing something weird with that; 3. `store_final_state` should count as ""storing something"", so no need to set `store_states` if `store_final_states=True` and there are no `e_ops`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1437#issuecomment-775216824:687,clear,clear,687,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1437#issuecomment-775216824,1,['clear'],['clear']

I'm saying that to do each state independently, `mesolve` and `sesolve` have to independently integrate each state, so even if we added this functionality into those functions directly, it would be little more than that loop I just wrote if you have used the tools I described in the first comment. If you want the entire system propagator, `qutip.propagator` can calculate that for you. Lots of people have successfully used QuTiP already as part of reinforcement learning protocols - I've worked with at least a couple, but if you have very specific domain knowledge of your system, you often will be able to write an integrator which is faster for your cases, rather than the full general-purposes ones in QuTiP.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1323#issuecomment-660471465:645,learn,learning,645,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1323#issuecomment-660471465,1,['learn'],['learning']

Usability,"What's wrong with just using a loop? Adding the `combine` statement is already extra work for you, and using the solver in a loop will be much clearer about what's going on. The `Qobj` object container is not meant to a vector of objects itself - use a list for that, or a numpy array if you're only going to do simple mathematical operations that you want broadcasting for (numpy will broadcast `*`, `/`, `+`, `-` and `**` correctly). The calculational complexity of the solver isn't helped by knowing you're going to do it a few times, but there are some setup costs that QuTiP already gives you the tools to alleviate. `mesolve` constructs a Liouvillian out the Hamiltonian and collapse operators; if you want to reuse the result of this, you should use `qutip.liouvillian` and `qutip.QobjEvo`, and use the `compile` method of the latter. You can pass the result of this directly as the `H` parameter of `mesolve` and it'll skip all the setup. There is some work going on about making a class-based interface to the solvers, which allows easier use of the tools to reduce setup time, but those likely won't be released for some time yet. In the meantime, just use a loop here. There will not be a notable slow down (unlike numpy maths operations) because the Python iteration over elements takes a negligible amount of time compared to single numerical intergration. As a side note, in this particular case you're doing unitary dynamics with state vectors, so this call to `mesolve` is actually translated into one to `sesolve`, which does not need to construct the Liouvillian.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1323#issuecomment-660459774:143,clear,clearer,143,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1323#issuecomment-660459774,2,"['clear', 'simpl']","['clearer', 'simple']"
Usability,"When no options and no e_ops are given, the solver should store the states, otherwise nothing is done. Since the default value si `store_states=False`, the solver don't know that the value was explicitly given or the default. We should have `store_states=None` as the default. This allow us to respect an explicit False while keeping the expected behaviour when no options are given. I will make this change in the v5 solver (And make sure no Options are modified). `tlist` was never meant to control time dependence, it represent the time at which the solver look at the state (+ first and last times). I added array support as coefficient as a shortcut to Cubic_Spline and I used the already existing tlist, but this is clearly a limitation and in v5 they will be controlled independently.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1437#issuecomment-775976194:722,clear,clearly,722,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1437#issuecomment-775976194,1,['clear'],['clearly']
Usability,"While you could probably make it work but manually updating the state at each times of `tlist` is certainly not a usage I planned for... If you could use `mesolve` instead of `mcsolve` it would be simpler:; ```; solver = MeSolver(...); solver.start(rho0, t0); for t in tlist[1:]:; rho_t = solver.step(t); solver.start(rho_t @ projection, t); ```. With `mcsolve`, if you use it like this, it would normalize the state at each step possibly breaking the montecarlo part of the evolution. The way I would do it is by making a child class overwriting the step of `McTrajectorySolver`:. ```; class MyMcTrajectorySolver(McTrajectorySolver):; def _step(self, t):; super()._step(t); _, raw_state = self._integrator.get_state() # state not normalized; new_state = _data.matmul(projector, state) # projector is a Data object: Qobj.data; self._integrator.set_state(t, new_state); return _data.mul(new_state, 1 / _data.norm.l2(new_state)). class MyMcSolver(McSolver):; _traj_solver_class = MyMcTrajectorySolver; ```; If done this way, you should be able to use the normal solver interface. This projection should be done once per call of `step` or per time in `tlist`, but I would confirm it before running simulation. `step` does not return the `collapse` part of the results. So if a collapse happen, it will not output it nor the time at which it happen. But the state evolution is done normally, collapse will happen as expected. To get them, you will need to fetch them with `solver.traj_solvers[i].collapse`. Feel free to comment on the new solver interface.

Usability,"Yeah, `qutip-qip` is a much easier build and installation process because you don't need to be concerned about compiler infrastructure, ABI compatibility or stuff like that. In addition in that particular test run, there were three individual calls to change the installed packages, which meant plenty of space for stuff to go wrong. In this case, I think it was a strange interaction between the old `.travis.yml` specifically installing `numpy` and all other dependencies from `conda-forge`, without the channel being in the defaults list. Since `conda uninstall` doesn't specify an additional channel, the dependency calculator considers `defaults` to be higher priority, so it sets various packages to arbitrary allowed ones from `defaults`, which with `openblas` installed like this meant numpy `1.14`. That's my guess at least - it's a pretty weird set up circumstances, but the new `.travis.yml` file that's already in `master` is far simpler about the build process.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1448#issuecomment-782177609:942,simpl,simpler,942,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1448#issuecomment-782177609,1,['simpl'],['simpler']

Usability,"Yeah, this is just one of those silly things caused by ImageMagick choosing a _very_ generic name and then getting burned (hence the swap to `magick`...). Probably the best thing to do is to try and run `convert` once at discovery and to see what happens.

It rearranged the functions a little for a more logical order (I'll rebase the PR before merge), but the main change is that it now tests the output of `convert -version` to see if it contains the substring `imagemagick` (case insensitive). The reason to do this now is because if we allowed the error to propagate later, we'd have to check it every time and it would mean we'd have to pass through the ""special cases"" more frequently, and it would make the core logic more complex.

This is big problem in IPython notebooks, where one cannot hit Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Z until process is stopped..

Usability,"You have a couple of ways of going about this. The simplest is to use the callback form of `e_ops` - you make a single function which looks like; ```python; def e_op(t, state):; # [...]; return expectation; ```; where `t` is the time and `state` is a `Qobj`. You can return whatever you like here, really, so you can return a tuple of values if you want to track more than one. If you do this, then you do; ```python; result = qutip.sesolve(H, psi0, times, e_ops=e_op); ```; and `result.expect` is a list of the same length as `times`, where `result.expect[k]` is the output of your function at a time `times[k]` (note that this is a slightly different output format to the normal method). Alternatively, you can do the calculation yourself without too much difficulty if your observables can be put in the form `A(t) = sum_k f_k(t) A_k`, like your example here. Because the expectation is a linear operation `expect(A(t), psi(t)) = sum_k f_k(t) expect(A_k, psi(t))`, so you can pass the list of `A_k` to `sesolve` and then just calculate the time-dependent coefficients yourself afterwards and add them up.

If you need it for HEOM, let's go for it. I don't like having expect being a dict. I was actually thinking of going with supporting the 3 cases, at least for the output. If we keep `expect` as a property, the format change can be done only there and we can keep it in another format, dict or list, inside. Simplifying `_post_init` will be tricky, normalization does not depend only on the option, but also the state...

Usability,"`. So I think we should aim to keep it simple. I think adding `f(t)` as a signature option will be sufficient for what @goerz wanted and would be sufficient for using a Numba jit. So, my suggestion for the next major release (v5) would be that we have only two call sigs:; - `f(t, args)` (default); - `f(t)`. For now we will have to have the three (although I don't think the `rhs_with_state` is not widely used, if at all).; - `f(t, args)` (default); - `f(t)`; - `f(t, state, args)`; The default needs to remain as it is, because it is widely used. I think it makes sense to use introspection to decide which has been specified by the user, as the sig is clearly distinguishable by the number of args. So effectively we can ignore the `rhs_with_state` option, but I think we should give a deprecation warning that the `f(t, state, args)` signature will be removed in the next version. So, I think this means we can keep the new method of passing the state in the args dict. I would suggest we make it a bit more simple though. I notice that the processing of the option is a bit involved. So I suggest that any element of the `args` dict where the key is of the form `name:special_value_kind` be considered some kind of special value. If `special_value_kind` is not recognised then it should throw a `ValueError`. For now we will have the `special_value_kind` of:; - `state`: Qobj of the state at time `t`, with the correct dimensions; - `state_vec`: ndarray of state as a vector; - `expect`: I can't remember exactly what you did here. The `state_vec` will clearly be much more efficient, as this is what the ODE solver maintains. However, for completeness I think we should have the `state` option. The initial value, as in `args = {'psi:state':psi0}`, seems fairly arbitrary, as I guess we can just just set the t=0 value anyway. I think you also implemented `expect` as a special_value_kind. I guess maybe the value of the element is the e_op, or maybe you use the `e_ops` param?.

Usability,"`QobjEvo` have a `with_state` method `QobjEvo.with_state(t, psi, args={})` which can be used instead of `__call__` if needed. It compute the coefficient on the python side and send them to the cython part if needed. But I don't like it like this, using `__call__` will raise and error if a psi is needed, and we need to treat it differently in solvers.; How about having the state inserted in the args dictionary.; So if the users have the key ""psi_vec"" or ""psi_Qobj"" in args and mul_vec (spmv)/ expect is used, it is automatically updated. With that definition most solvers could work without a special cases for `rhs_with_state=True`. The present method could still be supported using decorator.; Also it would be relatively simple to support expectation value in args in a similar way:; if a specific key/value is found in the dictonary (`args[""_expect""+name] = Qobj/ QobjEvo` ), it is replaced with the operator expectation value when possible. . For the present case, we should document it more than change it, going back to Qobj will slow the simulation. Maybe `rhs_with_state` could be more than a bool and offer the option?; Here ` expect_rho_vec(data, vec, isherm)` from qutip.expect could be used to skip the vec -> Qobj conversion. .

No-one's complaining about the difficult of maintaining them, because nobody _is_ maintaining them. `eseries` hasn't been meaningfully touched since 2014, and there's been an issue recently (#1262) where somebody pointed out that `essolve` doesn't do really simple parts of its spec.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1281#issuecomment-638112689:755,simpl,simple,755,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1281#issuecomment-638112689,1,['simpl'],['simple']

Usability,"`namedtuple` is not a bad idea, although it's a bit odd because `e_ops` is never a namedtuple and it doesn't solve the problem of what type `.e_ops` has. And `namedtuple` forbids attributes which aren't identifiers, which is also problematic. I guess we could write our own type, `Expect`, that acts enough like a list for numpy, etc but still allows item and attribute access. That feels a bit crazy, but maybe it is worth it?. I still feel that all of these options are overly complicated. `e_ops` is not a list conceptually. Lists are typically ordered, but unstructured. The `e_ops` are clearly not ordered because `e_ops[0]` doesn't ""come before"" `e_ops[1]` in any meaningful way. The order of the indexes in a list `e_ops` are meaningless -- they exist only because that is how Python lists work. *Sometimes* there may be a natural ordering to e_ops -- e.g. if they happen to be the projectors onto a complete set of basis elements -- but this a small subset of the more general situation where e_ops might be any set of operators and functions.

Usability,"`qutip.liouvillian` takes a Hamiltonian `H` and transforms it into the Liouvillian superoperator, which if no Lindbladian `c_ops` are supplied `liouvillian` is simply the `[H, .]` term you want. This is what `mesolve` does internally, if its first argument is an operator. The subsequent additions I made to the Liouvillian afterwards in that loop add on your non-Lindbladian collapse operators - `mesolve` will recognise that you have passed a superoperator and the only further processing it will to is to add any further Lindblad-form collapse operators found in the `c_ops` list.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1435#issuecomment-774026381:160,simpl,simply,160,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1435#issuecomment-774026381,1,['simpl'],['simply']
Usability,"agine, but not an unsolvable one.; - error if you pass something that defines `__qutip_qobj__` in addition to keywords. This isn't ideal because it gives `Qobj` special treatment - additional kwargs can override `Qobj` settings if they're compatible. ---. Just in the interest of completeness, let me also just bring up some of the sweeping changes we'll bringing in in QuTiP 5.0 as well, which massively overhaul how `Qobj` is constructed, and how its data is stored. These aren't _directly_ applicable to the current discussion, but they're worth keeping in mind since they're a huge overhaul of how things will be handled, and may have some implications for how implementors of this interface might behave. The new `Qobj` will no longer have the same `fast_csr_matrix` type as its `data` attribute, but instead will have an extensible data type. The two that will be distributed with the library will be `Dense` and `CSR` (which simply do what they say on the tin), and all linear algebra operations between multiple `Qobj` are handled by a custom multiple-dispatch system that allows additional specialisations to be added in a similar way to Julia. Say you want to define `matmul` between `Dense` on the left and `CSR` on the right to produce a `CSR` output (a specialisation that we likely won't ship with because it's unlikely to be efficient). You'd write your function; ```python; def matmul_dense_csr_csr(left, right):; ...; return out; ```; and then because unlike Julia it's not built-in, you just manually add it to the dispatch table for `matmul`:; ```python; qutip.data.matmul.add_specialisations(matmul_dense_csr_csr, (Dense, CSR), CSR); ```; QuTiP then knows about it, so it'll get used when appropriate. You can also add entirely new types to the dispatch table by adding them to the ""cast"" table `qutip.data.to`, giving at least one method to convert the new type into an already-known one, and at least one method to convert an already-known type into the new type.

Usability,"can propagate over the entire time grid in less than a few seconds. That would be a huge improvement over the current situation, where the lack of a good propagator limits the optimization effectively to toy problems. We *may* still try to implement in Cython some polynomial propagators (propagators that evaluate `exp[-i H dt] Ψ` or `exp[L dt] ρ` via expansion into a polynomial series - think Taylor series but faster converging, through the use of Chebychev or Newton polynomials). That work hasn't really been going anywhere lately, though. It may or may not end up being faster than `mesolve`, but it's certainly less flexible. So even then, an mesolve that can do single steps would still be great. I would also think that being able to do time steps would be exceedingly useful to *any* gradient-based optimal control scheme. Wouldn't it greatly simplify your own GRAPE implementation? I'm referring to the ""Object model"" in [Optimal Quantum Control in QuTiP](https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/guide-control.html?highlight=grape#optimal-quantum-control-in-qutip), specifically the `TimeslotComputer` (in fact, we looked at whether `TimeslotComputer` could be used for krotov at the time, but couldn't quite figure it out). I elaborated a little bit in https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/issues/93#issuecomment-859717563 on the requirements: beyond yielding the propagated states, we'll also have to modify the controls, i.e. the time-dependencies for QuTiP's nested-list format. Within the `krotov` package, these would always be numpy arrays. As an explanation, see [the figure for Krotov's update scheme](https://qucontrol.github.io/krotov/v1.2.1/_images/krotovscheme.svg) from [the documentation](https://qucontrol.github.io/krotov/v1.2.1/07_krotovs_method.html#time-discretization).

Be careful that the trajectory result have the final state stored. So I'm not entirely sure what you want the behaviour to be for each set of options. I think it is confusing to return a density matrix if you request store_states - the density matrix is not the same as the state of the system, and surely v5 is the perfect time to clear up issues like this. Personally I found this behaviour very surprising when updating to V5. I do agree that `density_matricies` should maybe be `average_density_matricies`.

Maybe there is some middle ground. My initial thought was to do something like use tuples instead of `Seq` and lists instead of `Par`, but that then ran into a couple issues. Namely, it wasn't as obvious what each kind of container meant, and it was harder to automatically flatten (e.g.: `Seq(1, Seq(2, 3), 4)` is identical to `Seq(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `Seq(1, Par(2), 3)` is identical to `Seq(1, 2, 3)` but distinct from `Seq(1, Par(2, 3))`). One alternative may be to have a single subclass `Outcome` of `tuple` instead of both, then overload operators like `|` to mean parallel. Internally, could use two subclasses like `Seq` and `Par` but display visually as `Outcome(1, 2 | 3, 4)` instead of `Outcome(1, Par(2, 3), 4)`. > * In QuTiP it's more normal to have the helper constructors not on the class as classmethods.

Usability,"ed features for a pulse-level description of quantum circuits and noise models. A new class `Processor` and several subclasses are added to represent different platforms for quantum computing. They can transfer a quantum circuit into the corresponding control sequence and simulate the dynamics with QuTiP solvers. Different noise models can be added to `qutip.qip.noise` to simulate noise in a quantum device. This module is still young and many features can be improved, including new device models, new noise models and integration with the existing general framework for quantum circuits (`qutip.qip.circuit`). There are also possible applications such as error mitigation techniques [1-3]. The tutorial notebooks can be found at http://qutip.org/tutorials.html#nisq. A recent presentation on the FOSDEM conference may help you get an overview (https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/quantum_qutip/). See also the Github Project page for a collection of related issues and ongoing Pull Requests. ### Expected outcomes; - More devices defined in the `qutip.qip.device` module. At the moment, we have two models: spin chain and cavity QED. We would like to include some other commonly used planform such as Superconducting system, Ion trap system or silicon system. Each model will need a new set of control hamiltonian and a compiler that find the control pulse of a quantum gate. This part is gonna involve some physics and study of commonly used hardware platforms.

Usability,"ee to re-organize it afterwards as he likes. . > 3 - we need to take care to do this in a way that still allows QuTiP to iterate and improve Qobj.__init__ between major versions. You could for example require that `__qutip_qobj__(self, version, *kwargs)` takes in a version of the API? I believe that is what numpy does in `__array_interface__`. And it's on implementers of the interface the burden of checking the api version and throwing an error if it's not supported. Or the inverse, where implementers return whatever data they return and a version of the API they are using, and qutip can throw an error if that is an older version. The latter would make it harder to support multiple versions of qutip in the implementers, but I would not worry too much about it. You can throw an error saying that this other package is not supported and you should either nag it's developers or downgrade qutip. I'm not particularly worried about the blame: even if the error is thrown from qutip, if the message is clear enough it will be clear that the fault is in the downstream implementors of the API. -- ; About keyword handling: copy-pasting the list of kwargs of `Qobj`...; ```python; inpt : array_like = Data for vector/matrix representation of the quantum object.; dims : list = Dimensions of object used for tensor products.; shape : list = Shape of underlying data structure (matrix shape).; copy : bool = Flag specifying whether Qobj should get a copy of the input data, or use the original.; fast : bool = Flag for fast qobj creation when running ode solvers.; ```. For the case of the usage that netket would have, our objects already define the Hilbert space they are acting on (so `dims` and `shape`). `copy` doesn't really make sense for us, because we would be building the representation . The way I see it, `Qobj(other_pkg_obj,**kwargs)` should behave like `Qobj(qutip_obj, **kwargs)`, so `__qutip_qobj__` should return the matrix data, shape and dims if possible, and qutip will handle i",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825710810:1813,clear,clear,1813,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825710810,2,['clear'],['clear']
Usability,"emal eigenvalues: that is, eigenvalues with large magnitudes. In particular, using which = 'SM' may lead to slow execution time and/or anomalous results. A better approach is to use shift-invert mode."". See also the example on that page. I tried using the 'shift-invert mode' as suggested, and that gave better results. But, they are still pretty bad for the problem I want to solve: I'm trying to find the low lying spectrum for a very large Liouvillian, as I vary a single external Hamiltonian parameter. The smallest one (in magnitude) is always zero, and all others are negative. Supposedly, the vanishing of the real part of the eigenvalue with the second largest (closest to zero) real part can be useful for characterizing phase transitions, see, for example, this recent paper: http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v110/i15/e150401. I attach a plot where I have computed the eigenvalue with second largest real part (which is also the one with second smallest magnitude; the two criteria coincide) using 1) scipy.linalg.eigvals (green line) and 2) scipy.sparse.linalg.eigs (blue line): https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6042643/liouvspec.png. As you can see, the results from the sparse solver are pretty poor (I assume the dense solver results are correct). . As far as the physics goes: Another thing to notice is that the system goes through phase transitions at -2.0, 0.5 and 2.0 for the parameter along the x-axis, and there are no signs of that in the plot. On a side note, I also wasn't able to reproduce Fig 2(a), middle panel, of the PRL paper I linked to, although I got qualitative agreement if I tried with different parameters than what is quoted in the figure caption. Do you by any chance happen to have any experience with this way of characterizing dynamical phase transitions?. I might try to make a simpler example illustrating the problem later. The Liouvillian I am considering now is too big to use as an example, as using the dense solver requires a huge amount of memory.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/16#issuecomment-16416062:2154,simpl,simpler,2154,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/16#issuecomment-16416062,1,['simpl'],['simpler']
Usability,"er function to handle the specific case of local multiplication, which examines the dimensions and target specifiers to produce the input to the `einsum`-like function, then calls the `Dispatcher` with this information. I think this form would likely be preferable for several reasons:; 1. it will allow arbitrary mixing of different data types (`CSR` complete space and `Dense` operator, or both `CSR`, or whatever), with the allowed conversions respecting the global dispatcher rules, not having this function use a different, special configuration; 2. it will mean that the function can also be implemented by plug-in data types (TF/CuPy/etc), installed separately to QuTiP; 3. it will be more general, and easier to maintain; the current `subsystem_apply`, `partial_transpose`, `ptrace`, `tensor_contract` and this can all become special cases of this backing `einsum`-like routine.; 4. after we've implemented new dimensions objects, we'll be able to use a more standardised description of how to refer to individual subspaces of a Hilbert space, which will provide a more consistent UX across the library. This is particularly important if we want this to work well with superoperators. Really, thank you very much for making the PR - I really am excited to see people with an interest in the new data layer! I'm sorry that I took quite so long to respond properly to it, and that when I have, I've ended up being somewhat against the implementaton as it is. I would be really interested in pursuing this, likely after the initial release of 5.0, but right now I think we might need to get our ducks in a row about licensing primarily, and then about how we're going to handle tensor networks in general. In order to prevent headaches down the line (and again, very very sorry), would it be ok if we leave this unmerged, and don't attempt to modify it in any way?

Usability,"er the hood will not fully understand how this is working. I believe the crux of this implementation is a fast computation of the tensors of `coherent_dm` operators for all the alpha values at (x + iy). Personally, on many occasions, I have looked at qutip implementations of quantum operations just to understand what is happening under the hood and I believe several users have often done this to hack around. If someone were to try and understand Q-function computation from this code, it seems simple enough with the call:. ```; np.abs(np.dot(alphas, (self._g*0.5)*vector))**2; ```. for state vectors, or decomposing a density matrix into state vectors and then running the above call. Or . ```; out = np.polyval(; (0.5*g * vector / np.sqrt(scipy.special.factorial(ns)))[::-1],; alpha.conj,; ); ```. But the object `alpha` now constructed with `_qfunc_alpha_matrix` class is a bit difficult to understand. The variable `self.conj = np.empty(x.shape, dtype=np.complex128)` creates a tensor and sets it to a mesh grid (x, -y), but then what does the `__call__()` return? The tensor of `coherent_dm(x+iy)` for each x and y coordinate? But how is it computing it without knowing the Hilbert space dim for the state, which I think is computed on the fly by `ns = np.arange(first, last).reshape(1, 1, -1)`. It seems it caches the `coherent_dm` computed upto `current_size` and then extends it to `size` for new Hilbert space dimensions. . I am sorry if I am being a bit thick here because I understand the overall idea of the code but somehow I am not confident it will be easy for others to understand on first read. Do you think we can make it a bit more transparent how the `_qfunc_alpha_matrix` works and that the crux of the method is computing the operators `coherent_dm` in an efficient way and saving them? If I have understood the code correct, I could try to document it a bit more and simplify it. .

Usability,"ex_array_to_rgb` could be useful in other contexts as well. I am not aware of any standard way of doing this, but if you are interested in this kind of mapping you might want to have a look at a similar mapping of complex values to color that we have in the function `matrix_histogram_complex`. In that case we map only the phase to the color, and the magnitude is shown by the bar heights, but if you map the magnitude to the alpha channel or the overall intensity you get something the is similar to what you use. For example, with the code from `matrix_histogram_complex` you get something like. ```; x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100); X, Y = np.meshgrid(x,x); Z = X + 1j * Y; cdict = {'blue': ((0.00, 0.0, 0.0),; (0.25, 0.0, 0.0),; (0.50, 1.0, 1.0),; (0.75, 1.0, 1.0),; (1.00, 0.0, 0.0)),; 'green': ((0.00, 0.0, 0.0),; (0.25, 1.0, 1.0),; (0.50, 0.0, 0.0),; (0.75, 1.0, 1.0),; (1.00, 0.0, 0.0)),; 'red': ((0.00, 1.0, 1.0),; (0.25, 0.5, 0.5),; (0.50, 0.0, 0.0),; (0.75, 0.0, 0.0),; (1.00, 1.0, 1.0))}. cmap = mpl.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap('phase_colormap', cdict, 256); norm = mpl.colors.Normalize(-pi, pi); colors = cmap(norm(np.angle(Z))); colors[:,:,3] = sqrt(abs(Z)) / sqrt(abs(Z)).max(). plt.imshow(colors, interpolation='none');; ```. which produces the following map of the complex plane:. ![complex-plane-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1198183/2809239/c3f6c3cc-cd61-11e3-83a1-cc4fff3f303c.png). compared to. ```; plt.imshow(complex_array_to_rgb(Z), interpolation='none');; ```. which produces. ![complex-plane-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1198183/2809256/29caad3e-cd63-11e3-8e7a-3187afc2744f.png). Either mapping is fine of course, but I think a nice property of the first one is that real numbers and imaginary numbers are mapped to simple colors (real positive->blue, negative->red and imaginary positive green, imaginary negative turquoise), and complex number with both real and imaginary part are mapped to colors that are relatively simple to interpret.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/105#issuecomment-41473950:1792,simpl,simple,1792,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/105#issuecomment-41473950,2,['simpl'],['simple']

Usability,"her would be responsible to ensure that the correct scalar gets passed appropriately to the specialisation and for returning not implemented if necessary. ; - This solves the inconsistency problem as you could register a ""new"" scalar and define how it gets cast to a python complex scalar with a function (in most of the times, if not always, this will be `complex(other)`). ; - This does _not_ solve having `NotImplemented` at the python space.; - It seems to be challenging to implement and will probably make things more difficult to maintain. 3) We can also define more rigorously what a scalar is for `Qobj` with a list, `_ALLOWED_SCALARS = [numbers.Number, ...]` that defines what we accept as scalars. We then do: `isinstace(other, _ALLOWED_SCALARS)` and return `NotImplemented` if not there. Two options here:; 1) QuTiP allows only `numbers.Number`:; - In this case `qutip-tensorflow` can extend `_ALLOWED_SCALARS` with tf.Variable and tf.Tensor. However, if the user uses two plug-ins, say qutip-tensorflow and qutip-something-that-does-not-work-well-with-tensorflow (second plug-in), the second plug-in may not work properly. ; - The above point is not a big deal if we make clear that _ALLOWED_SCALARS must accept `complex(other)` for compatibility reasons. In this way the second plug-in can always default to `complex(other)` (this is already the default behaviour of `mul_dense`).; 2) QuTiP allows `numbers.Number`, `ndarray` of shape `(,)`, `tf.Variable` of shape `(,)` and more in the future.; - The upside of this method with respect to 3.1 is that users know which types they must accept.; - This is probably not a good idea as it means qutip has to handle new dependencies (tensorflow and probalby more in the future).; - This _still_ defines what an scalar is at he `Qobj` level.

Usability,"ild of Python, and Python also typically optimises small allocations by using a custom allocator into some pre-allocated space it manages itself - invalid writes that still fall within this may not get detected by valgrind. Here is the output of `valgrind` running on the `kraus.py` file I wrote in the previous section: [kraus_valgrind.txt](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/files/6370180/kraus_valgrind.txt) (note I filtered out like 30,000 errors that stem from Python's internal memory management - they're nothing to worry about, they're just what happens when you have your own allocator). The important part is. ```; ==54133== Invalid write of size 8; ==54133== at 0x10AFAFA8A: ??? (in /Users/jake/.anaconda3/envs/py38/lib/libmkl_intel_thread.dylib); ==54133== by 0xFFFFFFFF: ???; ==54133== by 0x1162E4DEF: ???; ==54133== by 0x1162E3A5F: ???; ==54133== by 0x10550EB3F: ???; ==54133== by 0x3FEFFFFFFFFFFFFF: ???; ```. Obviously I don't have the debugging symbols for MKL, so it's pretty hard to say where exactly it's coming from, but it is at least clearly inside that library. I ran `valgrind` on the `Malloc.py` file above, and get the exact same invalid write, which is promising. So the most likely public Python call is `scipy.linalg.eig`. ## Minimal reproducer. Ok, so now let me cut it down to a minimum `eig.py`:. ```python; import numpy as np; import scipy.linalg. x = np.random.rand(25, 25) + 1j*np.random.rand(25, 25); scipy.linalg.eig(x); ```.

Usability,"ingle time steps with `mesolve`, optimization becomes feasible for any system that `mesolve` can propagate over the entire time grid in less than a few seconds. That would be a huge improvement over the current situation, where the lack of a good propagator limits the optimization effectively to toy problems. We *may* still try to implement in Cython some polynomial propagators (propagators that evaluate `exp[-i H dt] Ψ` or `exp[L dt] ρ` via expansion into a polynomial series - think Taylor series but faster converging, through the use of Chebychev or Newton polynomials). That work hasn't really been going anywhere lately, though. It may or may not end up being faster than `mesolve`, but it's certainly less flexible. So even then, an mesolve that can do single steps would still be great. I would also think that being able to do time steps would be exceedingly useful to *any* gradient-based optimal control scheme. Wouldn't it greatly simplify your own GRAPE implementation? I'm referring to the ""Object model"" in [Optimal Quantum Control in QuTiP](https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/guide-control.html?highlight=grape#optimal-quantum-control-in-qutip), specifically the `TimeslotComputer` (in fact, we looked at whether `TimeslotComputer` could be used for krotov at the time, but couldn't quite figure it out). I elaborated a little bit in https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/issues/93#issuecomment-859717563 on the requirements: beyond yielding the propagated states, we'll also have to modify the controls, i.e. the time-dependencies for QuTiP's nested-list format. Within the `krotov` package, these would always be numpy arrays. As an explanation, see [the figure for Krotov's update scheme](https://qucontrol.github.io/krotov/v1.2.1/_images/krotovscheme.svg) from [the documentation](https://qucontrol.github.io/krotov/v1.2.1/07_krotovs_method.html#time-discretization).

Usability,"ion to decide which has been specified by the user, as the sig is clearly distinguishable by the number of args. So effectively we can ignore the `rhs_with_state` option, but I think we should give a deprecation warning that the `f(t, state, args)` signature will be removed in the next version. So, I think this means we can keep the new method of passing the state in the args dict. I would suggest we make it a bit more simple though. I notice that the processing of the option is a bit involved. So I suggest that any element of the `args` dict where the key is of the form `name:special_value_kind` be considered some kind of special value. If `special_value_kind` is not recognised then it should throw a `ValueError`. For now we will have the `special_value_kind` of:; - `state`: Qobj of the state at time `t`, with the correct dimensions; - `state_vec`: ndarray of state as a vector; - `expect`: I can't remember exactly what you did here. The `state_vec` will clearly be much more efficient, as this is what the ODE solver maintains. However, for completeness I think we should have the `state` option. The initial value, as in `args = {'psi:state':psi0}`, seems fairly arbitrary, as I guess we can just just set the t=0 value anyway. I think you also implemented `expect` as a special_value_kind. I guess maybe the value of the element is the e_op, or maybe you use the `e_ops` param?. So, when there are special_value_kind args given, these are replaced with an arg `{name:value}` with the `value` being the value of the special_value_kind at time t. We should use internal flags (attribs) to control the special_value_kind processing, This will be more efficient than checking the args dict at every time step for special_value_kind keys, e.g.; - `_state_vec_key`: default `None`, or string key to the arg element. So, unless I have missed something regarding the importance of `**args`, then I think this plan covers what we need and makes everything a bit simpler, which is always good.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1136#issuecomment-562523162:2847,simpl,simpler,2847,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1136#issuecomment-562523162,1,['simpl'],['simpler']
Usability,"is a rounding match, because it gives a total `True` or `False` based on a floating point tolerance, not on exact equality. I'm not aware of any hash function which can handle this. Second, the `data` attribute of a `Qobj` is mutable in-place, and so hashing based on the data in the object is not valid. This is the same reason that `list` and `np.ndarray` are also not hashable types. If your cache is just for memoisation over a small number of `Qobj` where you know that floating-point tolerance will never be an issue, you may be able to get away with rolling your own cache decorator which uses linear lookup rather than constant-time. I mean something like; ```python; In [1]: import functools; ...: import qutip; ...:; ...: def linear_cache(f):; ...: cache = []; ...: @functools.wraps(f); ...: def out(*args):; ...: for cached_args, cached_value in cache:; ...: if args == cached_args:; ...: print(""Getting from cache""); ...: return cached_value; ...: print(""Computing new value""); ...: value = f(*args); ...: cache.append((args, value)); ...: return value; ...: return out; ...:; ...: @linear_cache; ...: def negate(x):; ...: return -x; ...:; ...: sx = qutip.sigmax(); ...: sy = qutip.sigmay(); ...: negate(sx); ...: negate(sx); ...: negate(sy); ...: negate(sx); ...: negate(sy); Computing new value; Getting from cache; Computing new value; Getting from cache; Getting from cache; ```; This will lead to degraded performance if you need to do it for a large number of possible inputs, but if you have a relatively small number of inputs and your cached function is computationally expensive, this may be a way to achieve what you want. Also note that this is not infallible: the floating-point tolerance used in `__eq__` means that `Qobj` does not satisfy transitive equality (i.e. `a == b and b == c` does not imply `a == c`). The primary consequence of this is that the cache will simply be a little under-zealous, and sometimes it will calculate the value twice for three similar `Qobj`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1321#issuecomment-658078277:2345,simpl,simply,2345,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1321#issuecomment-658078277,1,['simpl'],['simply']
Usability,"is is that the integrator component will just be one element of a composable system, so we'll not be tied to scipy integrators any more. I would absolutely not expect you to modifying how `mesolve` works directly. In fact, I would strongly recommend leaving the `mesolve` interface unchanged. The internal refactoring is all I'm after here. @jakelishman in https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-859917462:. > I also note that I'm not replying to the thread I thought I was - I thought I was in `krotov`! For my response to the discussion points:. Yeah, sorry the discussion got a little confused between what I was suggesting in https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/issues/93 for myself to try out (adding a `yield` to `mesolve` as a dirty hack) and the discussion here about how to address the underlying use case properly in QuTiP itself. So just to be clear: Do *not* add a `yield` to the existing `mesolve` function in QuTiP! I would strongly recommend keeping the existing interface for `mesolve` and just refactor what is going on in the backend to enable single-time-step propagation with as little overhead as possible. > * I think the function `qutip.mesolve` shouldn't change interface at all for 5.0 - we can change its backend, but I think it'll be a huge hindrance to adoption of 5.0 if we make major breaking changes to effectively our premier function, and I don't see a need to do that. We can add, rather than change, and keep `mesolve` as the ""quick-and-dirty"" method that just works.; > * I'm in favour of exposing the different parts of the `mesolve` process as user-accessible, composable chunks. So something like exposing a `mesolve_prepare_ode(H, state, c_ops) -> OdeState` function, where `OdeState` has properties `rhs: QobjEvo`, `state: Qobj`, `time: float` (`sesolve_prepare_ode` and `mcsolve_prepare_ode` would presumably return the same object, or a derived object).

Usability,"ite something constantly then module scoping isn't good, but if you have lots of different functions to test, and every test for a given function will want the same parametrisation, then class scoping might be a good choice. If you only need the parametrisation once, then it's best to put it right next to the place it's used (like in the case of mine that you've highlighted). It means that if you've opened that file to read the tests, then everything you need to understand `Test_fidelity.test_known_cases` will be on your screen if you just scroll to it. That makes it much easier for the next person who has to come along to edit your code. I used a couple of temporary variables in that case just to aid readability - my cases wouldn't have nicely fit on one line if I'd shoved the `qutip.basis(2, 0)` stuff inside the `pytest.param` constructors, and it would be hard to read. This way you can easily verify that the code is correct bit-by-bit; you can see clearly that the names are descriptive and match exactly what they say, and that means you can trust them when they then appear in the parametrisation. I won't pretend to be perfect at any part of coding, and particularly testing. I rewrote all the testing files starting from those beginning with ""a"" up to (now) ""metrics"" while I was first getting to know the QuTiP codebase, and hopefully you can see that my early efforts weren't that great, and they get a bit better and easier to read as time went on. (The later files haven't been converted yet.) The main things are to always be thinking about readability both of the code and the error messages that are coming out, and making sure that your tests are really testing that your functions have your behaviour you want them to have. Another thing we really don't have enough of in QuTiP yet is tests for ""negative"" behaviour, i.e. testing that functions _fail_ when they're passed incorrect inputs - consequently, quite a lot of QuTiP actually will just silently do the wrong thi",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1487#issuecomment-815044706:1737,clear,clearly,1737,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/1487#issuecomment-815044706,1,['clear'],['clearly']

Usability,"les in QuTiP follow the pep8 standard and wrap two newlines for top-level functions. I am in favor of the pep8 standard and have two newlines. @ajgpitch what do you suggest?. Please remove the helper function `count_filled` without the test if it is not required. We aim to test as much as possible and remove redundancy in code. About `__all__`, I will shift all the rest in a new PR and we can keep yours as it is now. Coming to the more important discussion regarding the `class` based implementation, I have started pushing for similar approaches in newer modules such as [qutip.models.piqs](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/models/piqs.py). I am also working on a new non-Markovian method which requires a class. Something of that sort is already used in `qutip.nonmarkov.heom`. I understand that many of qutip's solvers are written to be isolated functions but that should not mean that we should not write code to fully use the object oriented framework Python provides. Moreover, I noticed that you have to rewrite wrappers for the functions anyways to deal with repeatedly calculating things such as `scattering_probability` which clearly can be made much more compact if we use a class based approach. I am not making this suggestion just for the minor performance improvement. It improves the organization of the code, allows greater flexibility in adding new things to an existing class and modifying it easily. In terms of user experience, this means less clutter in the code and verbosity of arguments. You can initialize something once and keep re-calculating things by dynamically changing the parameters and calling the `class` method. If it does not hurt to slowly shift in this direction then I think we should go for it. If there is an alternative reason for not having classes then please let us know as the cons @bencbartlett mentions has more to do with following qutip precedent than some fundamental disadvantage in performance or use. @ajgpitch @nonhermitian",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/848#issuecomment-384860713:1871,clear,clearly,1871,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/848#issuecomment-384860713,2,"['clear', 'user experience']","['clearly', 'user experience']"
Usability,"lution that works for both. > * What is the advantage of this over using the existing superoperator representations?. I don't think there is one, per se, in the same sense that there's no strict advantage to superoperators over Choi operators over χ operators — each is useful in different contexts, such that QuTiP supports all three in order to allow users to pick the right representation for their problem. Similarly, operator-sum decompositions of channels are quite common and are useful in some special circumstances (e.g.: expressing a Choi-rank–sparse channel without requiring a 4^n × 4^n matrix). In the Quantum Development Kit, for instance, we use `qutip.to_kraus` to express user-supplied superoperators, Choi operators, and χ operators in terms of an operator-sum decomposition that is then passed to the underlying open systems simulator. While the operator-sum decomposition is quite useful internally to the simulator, that's not a detail that we want to enforce upon users, such that QuTiP's support for multiple superoperator representations is quite useful in presenting a user-friendly interface for configuring noise models. > * Can this advantage be carryied over into, e.g., using solvers, eigenvalue finding, etc?. I'm not sure I entirely follow, sorry?. > * Would it be better to have a new object, sort of like QobjEvo but for sums rather than evolutions?. Perhaps, but at least for the operator-sum decomposition of channels, it would feel a bit weird to me to have superoperators, Choi operators and χ operators all have one Python type, but for Kraus representations to have a fully different Python type. Whether I represent Λ(ρ) by 0.9 𝟙ρ𝟙 + 0.1 𝑋ρ𝑋 or {√(0.9) 𝟙, √(0.1) 𝑋}, they both represent the same function from density operators to density operators. > * How do you see the various mathematical operations working?.

Usability,"ly by a sparse matrix, and instead it'll be a Fortran-ordered dense matrix, for which the stack/unstack is a free operation. That's an extremely exciting prospect! I'd love to be able to have internal sparse data for Qobj's that represent Hamiltonians/Liouvillians, but dense data for Qobj's that represent Hilbert space states or Density matrices. In fact, it looks like a significant part of the overhead in the [calculation of the Krotov's pulse update](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/optimize.py#L466) is due to the stacking/unstacking, see [`profile.svg`](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/goerz/34af142b78d7e344417d838bbea78aaf/raw/f3f49104083d59b9612f153d2f0ff652ea6a9f01/profile.svg) in the [gist](https://gist.github.com/goerz/34af142b78d7e344417d838bbea78aaf#file-profile-svg). In the benchmarking notebook, for the optimization in `In [34]`, that's the extra 6 seconds per iteration (iterations 1-3 should ideally take exactly twice as long as iteration 0, as iteration 0 is a simple forward propagation and all later iterations are one forward and one backward propagations). That's what we have in our Fortran implementation, too: the runtime of the optimization is basically just the runtime of all the internal propagations; calculating the updates should be completely negligible. There's also [shape conversions](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/propagators.py#L254-L260) happening in [`DensityMatrixODEPropagator`](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/propagators.py#L162) which would be nice to eliminate. Lastly, having dense internal storage for states might actually give the same speedup as we've demonstrated in https://qucontrol.github.io/krotov/v1.2.1/notebooks/09_example_numpy.html for doing Krotov with numpy arrays instead of Qobj's -- potentially even more speedup, in fact, since with nump",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-860254243:4063,simpl,simple,4063,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-860254243,1,['simpl'],['simple']

In that case we map only the phase to the color, and the magnitude is shown by the bar heights, but if you map the magnitude to the alpha channel or the overall intensity you get something the is similar to what you use.

Usability,"m()` and so on all imply a particular basis). Beyond that, the ENR functions would attach some basis information onto their outputs to make them safe, and functions like `Qobj.transform` could take a required argument to name the new basis. . I'm certainly not considering this a priority, just a possible solution to the ENR problem and a couple of people had expressed interest in basis safety in the google group. We can always tack it on in a later release if it ever seems like a good idea in the future. #### Point 3. Yeah, this is absolutely all intended to be internal only. We wouldn't even print out this form in `Qobj.__repr__`, to my mind. You'd still type `dims=[[2], [1]]` to get a qubit ket and `dims=[[1], [2]]` for a qubit bra, so I don't think there's any confusion there. The reason there's not a special ""bra"" structure internally is because it's not necessary; a bra really is just a linear mapping from a particular vector space to the field, so having a special case for that makes more complex - the matmul compatibility test with `Map(Space, Field)` and `Map(Space, Space)` is the exact same test as for two operators, which simplifies the logic. ---. After sleeping on it, I still generally like the singleton pattern for this, but I think _completely_ relying on referential equality is probably a bit short-sighted. We can define, for example, `Space.__eq__` as; ```python; class Space:; def __eq__(self, other):; return (; self is other; or (; isinstance(other, Space); and self.size == other.size; and self.basis == other.basis; ); ); ```; so we'll almost invariably get the benefits right now, but we're rather more future-proof in the code. By analogy, it's clearly wrong to do `(1, 2) is (1, 2)` to compare tuples, even though `tuple` produces singletons in CPython (and that code will generally be `True`). The Python `tuple` class is basically what inspired me, and I'm 100% certain that the Python devs are smarter than I am, so we should probably stick with them.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1421#issuecomment-764870661:3566,clear,clearly,3566,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1421#issuecomment-764870661,1,['clear'],['clearly']

Usability,"minate. Lastly, having dense internal storage for states might actually give the same speedup as we've demonstrated in https://qucontrol.github.io/krotov/v1.2.1/notebooks/09_example_numpy.html for doing Krotov with numpy arrays instead of Qobj's -- potentially even more speedup, in fact, since with numpy now *everything* is dense (including the Hamiltonian), whereas the best thing to do numerically would be to do sparse-matrix-dense-vector operations (which is what we do in Fortran, incidentally). > In the form I've written it, this loop is thread-safe already. As it stands in the 4.x series, `mesolve` is re-entrant (I'm fairly sure), but note that it does generally mutate its arguments, especially if you pass a `QobjEvo` Liouvillian as the first argument. As long as you make sure you give each thread a distinct copy of the input Liouvillian, `mesolve` itself doesn't access global state as far as I recall. Just to be clear: there's two interconnected issues here: One is just being ""reentrant"" in the sense that I can safely have multiple `mesolve`'s run in parallel. This doesn't seem to be a problem for `mesolve` as a whole (propagating over the entire time grid). The other issue, at a lower level is whether I can keep the internal state of the integrator (`scipy.integrate.ode` or whatever else `mesolve` might be using) when propagating a single time step (and whether I can have multiple integrators to run in parallel that each safely keep track of their own state). That comes down to the integrator itself being ""reentrant"", of course. Certainly, calling `mesolve` in a loop (`In [19]`) doesn't keep the internal state of the integrator, hence the overhead between `In [21]` compared to `In [18]`. I wouldn't expect it to, of course, but the question is whether a refactoring of `mesolves` internals into an object that keeps state in a thread-safe way and allows doing time steps would alleviate this overhead (like the `mesolve_prepare_ode(H, state, c_ops) -> OdeState` tha",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-860254243:5639,clear,clear,5639,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1571#issuecomment-860254243,1,['clear'],['clear']

Usability,"n at seemingly non-deterministic times.; - Running files in a slightly different interpreter, running within a test runner with differing numbers of files, doing different work before and after will all cause the segfault to change, and may mask it.; - As annoying as they are, segfaults are actually the _good_ case of the bug - the worst is when we have invalid memory writes but _no_ segfault, because then we have memory corruption that's gone undetected. ## Thoughts about #1120. This issue is still present using Andrew's `Malloc.py` file as of the current master branch (commit 624405e7), and is in QuTiP 4.6.0 and most previous versions. I have been able to reproduce the segfaults with Python 3.7, but not Python 3.8, and I can reproduce it with all allowable values of `PYTHONMALLOC`. The most telling is `pymalloc_debug`, where the entire operation completes (it prints ""500""), and _then_ the fault occurs. This along with the error message should hopefully make it clear that an out-of-bounds write occurs occasionally, and it is temperamental where exactly this happens. This is typically not detected until the object is freed, when the Python allocators do a little bit of checksumming. I think that in _all_ cases we're seeing the failure come from the garbage collection, but I can't be 100% certain - note that this almost certainly means the failure is somewhere completely different, and it's only _detected_ at garbage collection. Here is the output of a Python 3.8 crash on the `Malloc.py` file with some additional debugging enabled. This is with Python 3.8.8, Numpy 1.19.2, Scipy 1.6.2 and MKL:; ```; jake@tauros$ PYTHONMALLOC=pymalloc_debug python -Xfaulthandler Malloc.py; 500; Debug memory block at address p=0x7fa2e02de610: API 'r'; 61503 bytes originally requested; The 7 pad bytes at p-7 are FORBIDDENBYTE, as expected.; The 8 pad bytes at tail=0x7fa2e02ed64f are not all FORBIDDENBYTE (0xfd):; at tail+0: 0x00 *** OUCH; at tail+1: 0x00 *** OUCH; at tail+2: 0x00 *** OUC",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1160#issuecomment-826124807:2114,clear,clear,2114,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1160#issuecomment-826124807,1,['clear'],['clear']
Usability,"name `__qutip_qobj__` so we realistically prevent any chance of a clash - by nature of a centralised package manager, we can be sure that no other package will ever be called QuTiP. If it's a hidden name, it doesn't matter how ""pretty"" it is.; 2. having the check in `__init__` might not be correct - it feels like it belongs in `__new__` to me. `__init__` modifies an object that's already been created in Python-space, whereas `__new__` allows you to replace the object creation entirely.; 3. we need to take care to do this in a way that still allows QuTiP to iterate and improve `Qobj.__init__` between major versions. If _we_ define a public interface like this rather than having external libraries provide their own implementations, it puts the burden of maintain compatability on us, and takes it off downstream packages, who are able to define version requirements. For example, calling `otherlib.obj.toqobj()` and having it fail with QuTiP next.0 makes it clear that `otherlib` isn't compatible with QuTiP next, whereas `Qobj(otherlib.obj)` failing would (rightly) be taken as QuTiP being at fault, which stymies our development a little because we're forced to be more conservative than we otherwise would be with our constructor. This is going to be a particular problem with handling `dims`, since we're talking about completely changing the structure for how that's managed internally to help us in other parts of our library.; 4. what will happen with all the other keyword arguments passed to the `Qobj` constructor? We have probably three choices:; - pass all keywords on (which is a big problem in conjunction with the point above);; - pass none of them on, call `__qutip_qobj__` within `Qobj.__new__`, and then pass through `Qobj.__init__` like normal, but now with our new `Qobj` instance as the argument. This would have a slightly nontrivial interaction with the `copy` keyword, I imagine, but not an unsolvable one.; - error if you pass something that defines `__qutip_qobj__` ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507:2824,clear,clear,2824,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825608507,1,['clear'],['clear']
Usability,"ndarray(dtype=object)` arrays behaved when containing objects that all implemented `__array__`. To get around _some_ of these problems, they've introduced `__array_function__` and `__array_ufunc__`, though to me at best these are bandages. Those two concerns aren't immediately applicable in QuTiP, but they're sort of indicative of potential problems when using a `__qutip_qobj__` method implicitly in functions like `Qobj.__add__`. These are where it becomes very evident that Julia-style programming doesn't apply in the same way in Python. Python is only a single-dispatch language, so `a + b` will dispatch using the table of `a` predominantly, whereas `b + a` will dispatch on `b`. In a proper multiple-dispatch library the rules are separate to the classes, so neither class is called preferentially, there's just one rule and either library can define it. My point with this is that if `Qobj.__add__` has a case where it handles Qobj-like types, then we prevent the other library from overriding the method. Multi-methods like this simply don't work the same in Python as they do in Julia, so even if `Qobj` implements interfaces from a variety of other libraries, we'd never get good consistent behaviour with functions like this. Operations that ought to be commutative like `+` would become dependent on operand order. To some degree, implementing the interface would be a guarantee that an object would always be able to follow QuTiP's semantics, otherwise it would just be annoying to users - _sometimes_ an object would be able to be used implicitly, sometimes not. I know the ""Python way"" is supposedly ""try it and see"", but if you're doing any serious development, that quickly becomes unreasonable if a type works some times, but not others. The other part of the Python way is ""explicit is better than implicit"", and here having an explicit type conversion to me is just being explicit about which library's semantics you want to follow, which is easier to read and easier to debug.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825646108:1657,simpl,simply,1657,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1508#issuecomment-825646108,1,['simpl'],['simply']
Usability,"ng like use tuples instead of `Seq` and lists instead of `Par`, but that then ran into a couple issues. Namely, it wasn't as obvious what each kind of container meant, and it was harder to automatically flatten (e.g.: `Seq(1, Seq(2, 3), 4)` is identical to `Seq(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `Seq(1, Par(2), 3)` is identical to `Seq(1, 2, 3)` but distinct from `Seq(1, Par(2, 3))`). One alternative may be to have a single subclass `Outcome` of `tuple` instead of both, then overload operators like `|` to mean parallel. Internally, could use two subclasses like `Seq` and `Par` but display visually as `Outcome(1, 2 | 3, 4)` instead of `Outcome(1, Par(2, 3), 4)`. > * In QuTiP it's more normal to have the helper constructors not on the class as classmethods.

Usability,"ng the SolverOptions class is an excellent idea, but I think the PR currently doesn't go far enough and ends up with the solver classes, the integrator classes and the solver option classes required to share too much internal state with each other. As a next step to try untangle things, I suggest the following:. - Let's remove the `known_solvers` and the solver `name` from the SolverOptions and instead have the base solver pass the allowed options with defaults in to the SolverOptions constructor directly. If the allowed options list is `None`, then we can allow all options (for the convenience of users who really want to make their own SolverOptions instances).; - Having the options able to notify a listener of changes seems great -- let's keep that.; - When a solver is created, let's have the base solver create a new SolverOptions instance, either from a dictionary or another SolverOptions instance, but with the allowed options and defaults now specified.; - To deal with the integrator options, let's go back to having a single option named `ode`, but have the value of `ode` have type `SolverOptions`, and be a child of the solver options (if the child has a value modified, it should notify the parent of the change).; - For convenience, when passing options as a dictionary, one should be able to use `{""ode.method"": ""vern9""}` or `{""ode"": {""method"": ""vern9""}`. I think that should be enough to disentangle things from each other. The base solver would need to update the integrator if integrator options change and deal with any changes to the base options. It's not completely clear to me whether the result options should also be sub-options or just be included in the solver options. I'm happy for them to be included in the solver options, as long as the solver options are passed to the result class constructor. That keeps things a bit simpler and if solver needs new result options it can always create its own result sub-class and just process its options there.

Usability,"nstructors when passed sequences of objects that all implement `__array__`. It is still possible to make a Numpy array of `Qobj` even with `Qobj.__array__` defined in Numpy 1.20, but you have to be rather more indirect about it:. ```python; >>> arr = np.empty((3,), dtype=object); >>> arr[:] = [qutip.qeye(2), qutip.qeye(2), qutip.qeye(2)]; >>> arr.shape; (3,); >>> arr[0]; Quantum object: dims = [[2], [2]], shape = (2, 2), type = oper, isherm = True; Qobj data =; [[1. 0.]; [0. 1.]]; ```. The reason numpy does this now is because (my understanding is that) defining `__array__` was meant to be a much stronger guarantee than just ""it's convenient to let `np.array` know about this object"". It was meant to be an indication that your class can be safely coerced into `ndarray` (and potentially coerced back afterwards), and that mathematical operations will satisfy the normal ufunc broadcasting rules, which isn't true of `Qobj`. That means that arrays of things implementing `__array__` should be safely representable as `ndarray`, which clearly isn't true for us. Similarly, ever since `Qobj.__array__` was first defined you could use Numpy ufuncs on `Qobj`, which would get implicitly converted to `ndarray` and then return complete nonsense, rather than throwing an error like ""what you're doing is silly"":; ```python; >>> np.sin(qutip.basis(2, 1)); array([[0. ],; [0.84147098]]); ```; (imo that should really be a `TypeError` if done without an explicit conversion into Numpy semantics). There is a way around that latter point in modern Numpy - defining `Qobj.__array_ufunc__ = Qobj.__array_function__ = None` - but it does raise the question of whether we _should_ define `Qobj.__array__`; we have no intention of implying that `Qobj` satisfies the general Numpy ufunc interface, and it isn't any sort of `ndarray`-like type, because it satisfies matrix semantics, not array semantics. That's the reason `scipy.sparse` types don't implement `__array__`.

Usability,"ntermediate step the integrator chooses to take, then you have to perform the matrix-vector product for each one individually and add them up. That's certainly worth trying: when calling `mesolve` in a loop over the time grid, I did indeed see a significant speedup when summing the Lindbladian into a single constant `Qobj`, see `In [21]` vs `In [24]`. On the other hand, it doesn't always give a speedup: in the low-level [`DensityMatrixODEPropagator`](https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov/blob/cfe6b108708cdfd29ab7eee24f2112977b951ed2/src/krotov/propagators.py#L162) it actually makes the propagation slower, see `In [29]` vs `In [32]`. It's a bit surprising, but then, as you say:. > [...] This isn't guaranteed, because it involves copying rather more data _before_ the call. So that's ok. > Would something like this work for you? [...]; >; > By giving `mesolve` the Liouvillian instead of the Hamiltonian and collapse operators separately. To be clear, I personally never use collapse operators (and the Krotov documentation heavily discourages it). Instead, I have a nested list like `[L0, [L1, control1], ...]` where `L0`, `L1`, ... are super-operators. I should also note that I use `mesolve` both for Schrödinger equations and Lindblad equations (relying on `mesolve` delegating to `sesolve`), and the Krotov package uses `H` as a variable/attribute name to refer to nested-Lindbladians or nested Hamiltonians interchangeable. Sorry if that's causing a bit of confusion. I am ultimately interested both in open system and closed system dynamics interchangeably. > [...] In the 5.x series, almost all the intermediary operations should get a speed up as well (`Qobj.__init__` is getting its time slashed, and the line `current_liouvillian += control * operator` may be able to be replaced with one that applies the same in-place calculation optimisations that `mesolve` does internally).

Usability,"ospection to decide which has been specified by the user, as the sig is clearly distinguishable by the number of args. So effectively we can ignore the `rhs_with_state` option, but I think we should give a deprecation warning that the `f(t, state, args)` signature will be removed in the next version. So, I think this means we can keep the new method of passing the state in the args dict. I would suggest we make it a bit more simple though. I notice that the processing of the option is a bit involved. So I suggest that any element of the `args` dict where the key is of the form `name:special_value_kind` be considered some kind of special value. If `special_value_kind` is not recognised then it should throw a `ValueError`. For now we will have the `special_value_kind` of:; - `state`: Qobj of the state at time `t`, with the correct dimensions; - `state_vec`: ndarray of state as a vector; - `expect`: I can't remember exactly what you did here. The `state_vec` will clearly be much more efficient, as this is what the ODE solver maintains. However, for completeness I think we should have the `state` option. The initial value, as in `args = {'psi:state':psi0}`, seems fairly arbitrary, as I guess we can just just set the t=0 value anyway. I think you also implemented `expect` as a special_value_kind. I guess maybe the value of the element is the e_op, or maybe you use the `e_ops` param?. So, when there are special_value_kind args given, these are replaced with an arg `{name:value}` with the `value` being the value of the special_value_kind at time t. We should use internal flags (attribs) to control the special_value_kind processing, This will be more efficient than checking the args dict at every time step for special_value_kind keys, e.g.; - `_state_vec_key`: default `None`, or string key to the arg element. So, unless I have missed something regarding the importance of `**args`, then I think this plan covers what we need and makes everything a bit simpler, which is always ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1136#issuecomment-562523162:1846,clear,clearly,1846,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1136#issuecomment-562523162,1,['clear'],['clearly']

Usability,"plicit conversions. I really do appreciate the interest, and I _am_ keen to let us have better compatibility with the rest of the community, but there are a lot of design concerns that we're going to want to work on our side first - I just want to caution you in case you're trying to work towards a PR, because I'm not close to being happy to accept one, yet. If we're going to do this (and we haven't decided if we will yet), we're going to need to get a lot of wide-ranging input from many different libraries, and we'll want to write out a proper design document and get approval of it before we get deep into the implementation. > The latter would make it harder to support multiple versions of qutip in the implementers, but I would not worry too much about it.

I'm concerned from a user's perspective. QuTiP has a wide user base, and we're beyond the stage where ""iterate fast and break things"" is ok for us (though of course it's fine and even good for pre-stable libraries, to avoid getting weighed down). We've got to be concerned with backwards and forwards compatibility; what if a user wants to install and use QuTiP and a different library in the same environment _without_ using them together, but can't even have them coexist because of version incompatibilities in optional conversion features? That's frustrating for users, even though it's not really anybody's fault. Bugging developers is fine when people want to use packages that are still maintained, but I'm sure we've all come up against times in research when you get to trying out a package to do one specific thing that's been abandoned for a while.

Usability,"ptions` class, is the way in v4 and will probably stay that way for a while. Having a options not knowing about the solver let it accept bad options and typos. Also it hides the options documentation: solver's options could be in the `??solve` function, but not integrator options. The integrator was merged into the solver in v4 and is not made to be used directly by the average user. So the user should not need to know they exist to use qutip, nor refer to them directly to see which options are supported. I'm not sure I am quite following, but my thought was that options would be checked by the solver class when they are passed in. The mechanism the solver class would use for doing the check, would be to pass the description of the allowed options to the SolverOptions class, along with the options themselves. > Not sure I understand why this would be convenient, flat seems a easier to use and less confusing. Ideally the user should not need to know that there are 2 levels of options. The reason for nesting the ode options a little, is to make it clear which options might change if the ODE method changes. If one hides the structure completely, there is nothing to guide the user as to which options are related to what. E.g. If ODE method ""A"" took option ""opt1"" and method ""B"" took ""opt2"" then it's much clearer what is happening if one has to pass `""ode"": {""method"": ""A"", ""opt1"": 1}` and `""ode"": {""method"": ""B""}` than `""method"": ""A"", ""opt1"": 1"" and `""method"": ""B"", ""opt2"": 2`. In the flat case, one might accidentally have `""method"": ""B"": ""opt1"": 1` and ""opt1"" would be ignored. I am not too hung up on the exact approach for this bit though -- I just want it to be clear to the user what is going wrong, and for it to be a little be hard to options for different ODE methods clash with each other or other solver options.

Usability,"r guarantee than just ""it's convenient to let `np.array` know about this object"". It was meant to be an indication that your class can be safely coerced into `ndarray` (and potentially coerced back afterwards), and that mathematical operations will satisfy the normal ufunc broadcasting rules, which isn't true of `Qobj`. That means that arrays of things implementing `__array__` should be safely representable as `ndarray`, which clearly isn't true for us. Similarly, ever since `Qobj.__array__` was first defined you could use Numpy ufuncs on `Qobj`, which would get implicitly converted to `ndarray` and then return complete nonsense, rather than throwing an error like ""what you're doing is silly"":; ```python; >>> np.sin(qutip.basis(2, 1)); array([[0. ],; [0.84147098]]); ```; (imo that should really be a `TypeError` if done without an explicit conversion into Numpy semantics). There is a way around that latter point in modern Numpy - defining `Qobj.__array_ufunc__ = Qobj.__array_function__ = None` - but it does raise the question of whether we _should_ define `Qobj.__array__`; we have no intention of implying that `Qobj` satisfies the general Numpy ufunc interface, and it isn't any sort of `ndarray`-like type, because it satisfies matrix semantics, not array semantics. That's the reason `scipy.sparse` types don't implement `__array__`. There always was a sanctioned method for converting `Qobj` to `ndarray` - `Qobj.full()`, similar to `scipy`'s `spmatrix.toarray()` - so `Qobj.__array__` was never a _necessity_, just a convenience in some workflows. Given the tools we can use to suppress the ufunc behaviour, the only question we need to decide on is whether that particular convenience (converting a single `Qobj` to `ndarray` with `np.array` rather than `Qobj.full`) is worth the loss of another (it's now rather faffy to put `Qobj` into an `ndarray`). Both have simple alternatives and I'll go along with either, though my personal preference is not to define `Qobj.__array__`.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1433#issuecomment-773992094:3876,simpl,simple,3876,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1433#issuecomment-773992094,1,['simpl'],['simple']

Usability,"re those written in the notebook. Various stochastic integration method are provided, the default is the taylor expansion of order 1.5. Thank you very much for your reply, but I still don't quite understand `smesolve`'s `expect` are just the expectation value of the state of each trajectories”. In my understanding, solving for 'smesolve' gives the corresponding 'ρ(t)' and then 'expect'. But 'smesolve' provides **[ntraj [int] number of trajectors]**, which means that there are _ntraj_ 'ρ(t)' (`expect`). If I want to show all _ntraj_ ‘s 'expect', how can I do it?. Can I understand `result.measurement` as measuring(POVM) the `smesolve.result` (where ρ(t) was given by solving the stochastic master equation) .$\hat{\rho}_{f}=\frac{\hat{\Omega}_{m}\hat{\rho}\hat{\Omega}_{m}^{\dagger}}{\mathrm{Tr}[\hat{\Omega}_{m}\hat{\rho}\hat{\Omega}_{m}^{\dagger}]}$。If this is the case, I don't understand the point of doing the measurement again here, because the stochastic master equation itself has a continuous measurement. What I want to do is simply solve the stochastic master equation to get enough trajectories **ρ(t)** and solve the relevant expected value **Tr[ρ(t)A]**. On the one hand, I want to see the expectations of all N quantum trajectories ρ(t)'s expect (**Tr[ρ(t)A] maybe with different dW**), and on the other hand I want to compare the expected average of N quantum trajectories with the result of the master equation(`mesolve.expect`).

Usability,"sis (`sigmaz()`, `num()` and so on all imply a particular basis). Beyond that, the ENR functions would attach some basis information onto their outputs to make them safe, and functions like `Qobj.transform` could take a required argument to name the new basis. . I'm certainly not considering this a priority, just a possible solution to the ENR problem and a couple of people had expressed interest in basis safety in the google group. We can always tack it on in a later release if it ever seems like a good idea in the future. #### Point 3. Yeah, this is absolutely all intended to be internal only. We wouldn't even print out this form in `Qobj.__repr__`, to my mind. You'd still type `dims=[[2], [1]]` to get a qubit ket and `dims=[[1], [2]]` for a qubit bra, so I don't think there's any confusion there. The reason there's not a special ""bra"" structure internally is because it's not necessary; a bra really is just a linear mapping from a particular vector space to the field, so having a special case for that makes more complex - the matmul compatibility test with `Map(Space, Field)` and `Map(Space, Space)` is the exact same test as for two operators, which simplifies the logic. ---. After sleeping on it, I still generally like the singleton pattern for this, but I think _completely_ relying on referential equality is probably a bit short-sighted. We can define, for example, `Space.__eq__` as; ```python; class Space:; def __eq__(self, other):; return (; self is other; or (; isinstance(other, Space); and self.size == other.size; and self.basis == other.basis; ); ); ```; so we'll almost invariably get the benefits right now, but we're rather more future-proof in the code. By analogy, it's clearly wrong to do `(1, 2) is (1, 2)` to compare tuples, even though `tuple` produces singletons in CPython (and that code will generally be `True`). The Python `tuple` class is basically what inspired me, and I'm 100% certain that the Python devs are smarter than I am, so we should probab",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1421#issuecomment-764870661:3026,simpl,simplifies,3026,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1421#issuecomment-764870661,1,['simpl'],['simplifies']
Usability,"specific use cases. My idea was a bit more simple - precomputing the `coherent_dm` operators (using qutip.coherent_dm) and using the `expect` function. But that performs worse that the original `qfunc` as well as this implementation of course. So this is great. I would be happy to merge this but have one thought:. This new implementation is sacrificing the ease-of-understanding of how Q-functions are computed with a very efficient and fast, but complicated class-based implementation. This means that users who want to look under the hood will not fully understand how this is working. I believe the crux of this implementation is a fast computation of the tensors of `coherent_dm` operators for all the alpha values at (x + iy). Personally, on many occasions, I have looked at qutip implementations of quantum operations just to understand what is happening under the hood and I believe several users have often done this to hack around. If someone were to try and understand Q-function computation from this code, it seems simple enough with the call:. ```; np.abs(np.dot(alphas, (self._g*0.5)*vector))**2; ```. for state vectors, or decomposing a density matrix into state vectors and then running the above call. Or . ```; out = np.polyval(; (0.5*g * vector / np.sqrt(scipy.special.factorial(ns)))[::-1],; alpha.conj,; ); ```. But the object `alpha` now constructed with `_qfunc_alpha_matrix` class is a bit difficult to understand. The variable `self.conj = np.empty(x.shape, dtype=np.complex128)` creates a tensor and sets it to a mesh grid (x, -y), but then what does the `__call__()` return? The tensor of `coherent_dm(x+iy)` for each x and y coordinate? But how is it computing it without knowing the Hilbert space dim for the state, which I think is computed on the fly by `ns = np.arange(first, last).reshape(1, 1, -1)`. It seems it caches the `coherent_dm` computed upto `current_size` and then extends it to `size` for new Hilbert space dimensions. .

Usability,"ssues/1268#issue-619006856)), which can get a bit messy, as there's Python's `random`, NumPy's `random` (which also comes in a legacy and a modern flavour, namely `numpy.random.RandomState` and `numpy.random.Generator`). Also, as you've mentioned, there's tight coupling between the implementation logic and the corresponding set of tests, and updates in the former require constant maintenance of the latter.; - As an alternative, I've sometimes resorted to [`mock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html)ing the random-number generation process itself, and - in a way equivalent to using a fixed seed - providing a pre-defined sequence of numbers to the functions which depend on those. It comes with the same disadvantage of relatively tight coupling, but is somehow more flexible and powerful than just setting the seeds.; - I have used Hypothesis in the past (on a relatively small-scale project), and it's indeed a great framework with a lot of interesting and nice functionalities. I like it very much, but one disadvantage I ran into was the increased overall time for completion of a test run. In my case, a viable approach, for instance, was to run my Hypothesis tests (which were a subset of all tests) with a bit larger periodicity (in the CI pipeline) than the regular tests. Another concern that I intuitively have (I may be _wildly_ wrong on this one, though, not having yet properly explored QuTiP's testing landscape) is that - depending on how some Hypothesis tests are set up - there might be a cost incurred in that, eventually, one might have to implement guards against inputs, that would be virtually impossible (or very close to that) to occur in practical scenarios. In any case, I'd strongly recommend performing a time-boxed experiment on a small subset of tests, which are more suited to property-based testing, and examining how that affects the test-run-completion time(s) and whether it introduces more failures than what would be desired/cost-efficient.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-1123679707:2647,intuit,intuitively,2647,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/1268#issuecomment-1123679707,1,['intuit'],['intuitively']
Usability,"st sub- and super-diagonals look like; ```[sqrt(1), -sqrt(2), sqrt(3), -sqrt(4), ...]```; and the diagonal of `P` looks like; ```[i, e^(-1i arg(alpha)), i e^(-2i arg(alpha)), e^(-3i arg(alpha)), ...]```. Now this real-symmetric tridiagonal form is the basis of Hermitian eigenvalue solvers, and has direct entry points in LAPACK (e.g. `?stemr`), which allow us to pass only the main diagonal and the first subdiagonal. Scipy provides convenient wrapped access in Python by `scipy.linalg.eigh_tridiagonal`. This lets us get the full eigensystem of `T`, which is related to that of `G` by dividing the eigenvalues by the scaling factor, and multiplying the eigenvectors by `P` to transform them into the correct basis. We now have a diagonalised matrix `G = Q^-1 . D . Q`, so `exp(G) = Q^-1 . exp(D) . Q`, which is now trivial because `D` is diagonal. Putting all this together allows us to use our knowledge of the problem domain to convert the matrix exponentiation problem into a much simpler real-symmetric tridiagonal eigensystem problem, which gets us a nice big speed up, and it's equivalent up to the tolerance of the eigenvalue solver (~1e-14). Even better for you, a lot of the hard work is done in the eigensystem solver, and I scaled out `alpha` at the start, so we can do a good chunk _without fixing alpha_. That means we can pay the computational cost only once at the start, and then get faster calculations from then on.

Usability,"torial notebook explicitly as an example how it works on the RIKEN cluster, and I refer to the mpi4py users guide. That being said, we do want to set up an automated test for this, and we do want to understand what went wrong in our initial attempts to set up those tests. The two main problems we encountered were (a) if mpi4py is installed with pip, all mpi_pmap calls hang; (b) if it is installed with conda, test_map_pass_error hangs sometimes.; The difference between pip and conda comes from the fact that mpi4py requires an MPI implementation. If we use mpi4py's GH workflow to install it with pip, it installs MPICH, and with conda, it installs OpenMPI by default. I noticed that in both cases where mpi_pmap hangs, there *are* error messages, but they are captured by pytest and then never printed because the program hangs... Regarding problem (a), in short, it looks like an MPICH bug to me. I thus decided to use OpenMPI instead, and added `conda install ""openmpi<5"" mpi4py` to just one of our test runs (the python 3.12 one). Regarding problem (b), the problem was that we requested more processes than the default number of slots available. With OpenMPI, the default number of slots available is the number of physical cpu cores (which seems to be 2 on the machine running our tests, leaving only one slot for a worker process). In the `parallel` module, if num_cpus is not provided, it defaults to `available_cpu_count()` (which is 4 on this machine, since there are 4 logical cpus). We could try to find a better default value for num_cpus for mpi_pmap, but I feel like writing that well would require deeper MPI knowledge than I have. What I did instead is, I tried to make it clear in the documentation that the default value might be unsuitable for MPI applications, and I emit a warning if the default value is used. At the same time, I set `OMPI_MCA_rmaps_base_oversubscribe=true` in the test run, which allows OpenMPI to create more processes than the number of available slots.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2296#issuecomment-1923102432:2135,clear,clear,2135,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/2296#issuecomment-1923102432,1,['clear'],['clear']

I think I can summarize the two MC simulation strategies into two kinds: one is that we generate a random number at each time step, and then compare it with the jumping probability (1-P(no jump)), and decide which jump to make using the jumping operators; the other one is that we generate a random number, and let it to be the no-jumping probability, and let the system evolve until it ends at the so-called waiting time by judging if the probability of no-jumping reaches the generated random number, and then decide which state to jump.

Usability,"ts could pick up imaginary parts etc. Perhaps this kind of thing cancels out when you add the two unphysical D-L baths to get the shifted D-L bath?. One can use the analytic expression for monomer absorption spectra to test which Drude-Lorentz bath is correct. Also, one can use [DM-HEOM](https://github.com/noma/dm-heom) [2], where they have implemented the ""Shifted Drude Lorentz Bath"" [1]. Compared with their Matsubara implementation, it gives the same density matrix evolution (up to the numerical accuracy) as QuTiP's HEOM gives with `DrudeLorentzBath` and $\gamma \rightarrow \gamma \pm \Omega$ and $\lambda \rightarrow \lambda/2$. But it is not the case for `DrudeLorentzPadeBath`. You are right to think that the unphysical part goes away when two baths are added [1], one with $+i\Omega$ and the other with $-i\Omega$. > However, I would want to be very sure that in the case where the parameters are all real, the results are not affected by the change. Is that so? Only asking because that is not clear to me at first glance. You are very much in the right to be absolutely sure before making a change. As far as I understand and have tested, it will not change the real case because the changes are as follows (I have removed all the other lines in between for clarity):. ```python; - ck_real = [np.real(eta) for eta in eta_p]; + ck_real = [eta for eta in eta_p]. - ck_imag = [np.imag(eta_p[0])]; + ck_imag = [-lam*gamma]. - eta_p = [lam * gamma * (self._cot(gamma * beta / 2.0) - 1.0j)]; + eta_p = [lam * gamma * (self._cot(gamma * beta / 2.0))]; ```; if `gamma` is real, `lam * gamma * self._cot(gamma * beta / 2.0)` would be real, and hence `ck_real` would stay the same as before, and the same can be said for `ck_imag`. After all, this is how it is done for `DrudeLorentzBath`, so it should not impact anything. > A more ""complete"" and probably more efficient solution would be to add a whole new ShiftedDrudeLorentzBath, and to put in analytically derived formulas for the Matsubara",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2520#issuecomment-2358685274:1456,clear,clear,1456,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/issues/2520#issuecomment-2358685274,1,['clear'],['clear']

I do understand your point, and I see how you want to be backward and forward compatible, however I don’t think that my proposal would break different tools in the same environment. What I propose would simply prevent `qutip.Qobj(otherlibraryobject)` from working (with an explicative error message) if `otherlibrary` does not support the same qobj interface version. Everything else would work the same. You can still import and use the two libraries independently without issues. It’s indeed possible to design around this and supporting at the same time different versions of the interface, however, and there’s value in doing so. > To me, this is absolutely one of the mistakes that Numpy made in their implementation, and we shouldn't be copying it.

Usability,"u supply the arguments for the particular Hamiltonian, i.e., pulse_length, area, `n_emission` etc. This is similar to the wrapping function that you wrote for your `pool` processes in the notebook. I need to understand the physics a little bit more to ascertain which are the quantitites that would form the arguments for the scattering_probability function and which ones would be fixed for an experiment (hamiltonian for instance). But the overall idea is that you make a class for a particular scattering experiment, give it a fixed Hamiltonian function and keep the calculations flexible wrt to the parameters of interest (pulses, gamma etc). A prototype example would then be:; ```; from qutip.scattering import PhotonScattering; from qutip.scattering import hamiltonian_tls, hamiltonian_rft; ...; scatter = PhotonScattering(hamiltonian_tls, tlist, c_ops, zero_state = psi0, effective_hamiltonian = True); prob_scatter = scatter.scattering_probability(n_emissions, gamma, pulse_length, pulse_area); ```; For a different hamiltonian, the example would be:; ```; scatter = PhotonScattering(hamiltonian_spdc, tlist, c_ops_spdc, zero_state = psi0); prob_scatter = scatter.scattering_probability(n_emissions, pulse_length=pulse_len); ```; I will be happy to help with this and discuss if you are interested, @bencbartlett. Adding these small changes from your notebook example into the main code could make your module more general and flexible. It is just a design choice and is usually followed in many Machine Learning modules (sklearn) where an experiment is abstracted in a class with global parameters (a Hamiltonian or propagators for instance) and then the methods of the class are used to compute things on-the-fly by supplying the variables of interest (gamma, pulse_area etc). We can still add the code in the current form but nevertheless I would like to discuss this once. This gives more functionality to the tool and could make it very flexible and easy to use. @ajgpitch @nonhermitian",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,qutip,qutip,v5.0.4,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/848#issuecomment-384566684:2080,Learn,Learning,2080,https://qutip.org,https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/848#issuecomment-384566684,1,['Learn'],['Learning']

Usability,"y.linalg.eigh_tridiagonal`. This lets us get the full eigensystem of `T`, which is related to that of `G` by dividing the eigenvalues by the scaling factor, and multiplying the eigenvectors by `P` to transform them into the correct basis. We now have a diagonalised matrix `G = Q^-1 . D . Q`, so `exp(G) = Q^-1 . exp(D) . Q`, which is now trivial because `D` is diagonal. Putting all this together allows us to use our knowledge of the problem domain to convert the matrix exponentiation problem into a much simpler real-symmetric tridiagonal eigensystem problem, which gets us a nice big speed up, and it's equivalent up to the tolerance of the eigenvalue solver (~1e-14). Even better for you, a lot of the hard work is done in the eigensystem solver, and I scaled out `alpha` at the start, so we can do a good chunk _without fixing alpha_. That means we can pay the computational cost only once at the start, and then get faster calculations from then on. If I make a totally fair test, and simply replicate the full functionality of `qutip.displace` (including creating a `Qobj` at the end), my method is ~4x faster on small matrices (`1 <= dim <= 20`) and it only goes up from there (I found it's about ~10x faster at `dim = 1000`, and beyond that `qutip.displace` is too slow to bother).
