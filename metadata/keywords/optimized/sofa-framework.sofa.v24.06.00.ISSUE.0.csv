Availability," #1527. ## What; SofaHelper, SofaDefaulttype, SofaCore and SofaSimulationCore does not respect the new naming convention (following namespace, etc). So this PR renames those 4 modules:; - SofaHelper ▶ Sofa.Helper; - SofaDefaulttype ▶ Sofa.Defaulttype; - SofaCore ▶ Sofa.Core; - SofaSimulationCore ▶ Sofa.SimulationCore (this one will need more work for the namespaces etc). This PR does not rename physically the folders, I preferred split the renaming in two steps (and have a less chaotic git history). ## Breaking?; Nope, thanks to the Alias system in CMake (I would have not bet on that at the beginning 😗); I could compile SofaPy3 out-of-tree without changing anything. I added some compatibility for the previous cmake macro/variables in the config.h (e.g SOFAHELPER_HAVE_BOOST instead of the new variable SOFA_HELPER_HAVE_BOOST).; These variables are not used at all in the code base of SOFA but some users might use them in their external plugins?. Actually, it could break projects using directly SofaHelper(&co) directly, i.e not handling CMake target but library names directly. (but people should not do that 🤥). Tested with an out-of-tree build of SofaPy3. ## After; Once everything is done, and once things are calming down in the SofaFramework, the folders themselves can be renamed. . ______________________________________________________.

It is undeniable that `std::map` and `std::unordered_map` are faster than `sofa::helper::map_ptr_stable_compare`. However, I don't know how crucial it is to have this kind of map with a dedicated comparator. Is this feature necessary? If not, I am in favour of using `std::unordered_map` wherever `sofa::helper::map_ptr_stable_compare` is used, for performances reasons. Overall, we won't get a huge gain of fps, but still it has an impact on the peformances of `NarrowPhaseDetection`. Initially, I wondered why `NarrowPhaseDetection` took so much time for so simple instructions. ______________________________________________________.

CompressedRowSparseMatrixMat3x3d is faster because it manipulates blocks of 3x3, which is the best strategy in this case. Unfortunately, Eigen manipulates scalars only.; To be fair, EigenSparseMatrixd must be compared to CompressedRowSparseMatrixd. We notice a slight speed up with EigenSparseMatrixd . I wanted to use Eigen::BlockSparseMatrix to have blocks of 3x3, but as an unsupported module, it does not compile with Eigen 3.4. I increased the resolution of the grid: MBKBuild becomes slower than CompressedRowSparseMatrixd, and MBKSolve stays faster than CompressedRowSparseMatrixd. Due to the slow down in MBKBuild, EigenSparseMatrixd is not very interesting in this example. I'll continue my investigations on the use of these wrappers. ______________________________________________________.

The speed up is quite disappointing. But the benchmarks explain it. The speed up depends on the size of the matrix, the sparsity and overall on the size of the intersection.; Yet, there is a speedup. And compared to the reference timings before the series of optimizations (https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/2362), `MechanicalMatrixMapper` is about twice faster (in the example). Some notes:. - I added a skeleton to also support product of `CompressedRowSparseMatrix`, but it is not implemented yet. In `MechanicalMatrixMapper`, a `CompressedRowSparseMatrix` is converted to Eigen to do the product. It is not clear yet if the copy to Eigen is required if we are able to perform the fast product on a `CompressedRowSparseMatrix`. So, an implementation of the fast product of `CompressedRowSparseMatrix` may be introduced in the future. Otherwise, I'll remove the files.; - This work has been started by @Esther-R during her internship; - Contrary to the regular product, the product using the intersection can be parallelized for more speed up.; - More speed up in `MechanicalMatrixMapper` using multithreading can be considered. ______________________________________________________.

Availability," CompressedRowSparseMatrix . I renamed all the **bloc** words to **block** as well. The previous CRSMatrix could be used as a BaseMatrix (solvers), ConstraintMatrix (iterations) and as a pure CRS itself.; This new CRSMatrix is decomposed in several types:; - CRSGeneric (name to be changed maybe): the pure CRS structure; - CRSMechanical: inheriting/implementing BaseMatrix; - (in a next PR) CRSConstraintMatrix, with the same API as the old CRSMatrix used for ConstraintMatrices (for iterating). Different purposes need different traits (some case would prefer autocompression, etc), so a lot of compile-time options are present. They are called policy.; I needed to change some flags from the Insimo's version to have the same behavior for the tests. So in the future, it could be interesting to see if those changes should be integrated later for more performance (but the tests would need to be changed). For compatibility reasons, the old ""CRSMatrix"" type is an alias on CRSMechanical. In this PR, no change of performance is noted (neither regression or upgrade).

Availability," Now, `x`, `y`, `z` and `w` are compiled conditionally. Other methods, such as `Identity`, `transpose` etc, are also concerned for squared matrices. The `static_assert` are therefore no longer useful. . `Identity` has been changed so it is `static constexpr` and it returns a reference. So there is no need to compute the identity matrix each time it is called. `s_identity` is now deprecated. The static variable is now included in the `Identity` method. It is better for static initialization fiasco and required for a `constexpr` context. Also, `s_identity` does not make sense for rectangular matrices. Since it is not possible to conditionally add a class member, it is hidden in the conditionally compiled method `Identity`. In `fixed_array`, the `operator<` is moved out of the class. This allows to compile this operator only when used, and not in explicit instantiations. This is necessary because the operator on `fixed_array<Vec3>` is not implemented (and does not make sense). The 3x3 matrix product and the `multTranspose` operation are specialized for a speedup. https://github.com/alxbilger/SofaBenchmark was used. Results show that this implementation is closer to the Eigen implementation. Unit tests are added.

Availability," an existing ""Intersection"", e.g MinProximityIntersection and MeshMinProximityIntersection, which add triangles, etc methods to MinProximityIntersection. Note that even if it is called ""Intersection"" it is not a ""Intersection"" 🤪; There is kind of mechanism with a IntersectorCreator/IntersectorFactory which does the ""plugin"" automatically.; The problem is that the intersector gets a pointer to its intersection at the load-time (when the dll is loaded).; The intersector needs the intersection to get alarm/contact distance (defined for all Intersection) or custom parameters (useSurfaceNormal for MinProximityIntersection). **Consequence:** if there are multiple simulation (in multiple thread) in the same time, a different thread will get a pointer to an other Intersection while doing its intersect code.

Availability," convention as the one used in DataTypeInfo<>. So ```f``` instead of ```float```, ```vector<f>``` instead of ```vector<float>```, ```Vec3d``` instead of ```Vec<3, double>```. Unifying the other way around would have implied to use ```Vec<3, double>``` in our scene templates... which was a bit too much :); With that in mind, the current implementation of DataExchange is behaving exactly as it should. . The unittest you are pointing is showing a normal behavior. This behavior is that the template type that does not have a Name() static method and used in a class that is not implementing GetCustomTemplate will fall back to the automatic generation decoded from the typeid(). But this automatic generation is the code we want to get rid of (if one day someone has enough time to fix that) and not desired behavior to align with. Automatic decoding function to avoid breaking too much things until future evolution. . So currently the DataExchange implementation is using GetCustomClassName in order to implement consistent templates name with the other sofa components and not relying on the automatic generation. . If you are interested in unifying things i would recommend:; short term: implement a way to automatically use the DataTypeInfo<>::name() in the NameDecoder. If I remember well initially we didn't wanted to... because sofa::defaulttype was not a dependency of sofa::helper but now we have cleaned a lot that part it is possible to make something quickly. This would allow to remove all the GetCustomClassName in our code base to directly forward to DataTypeInfo<DataType>::name() when available instead of falling back. middleterm: add deprecation management to the falling back code to warn user it will disapear (when it was done we didn't has deprecation menagement...maybe it is worth having a look at that part nowaydays). longterm: remove all that crappy template DataTypeInfo<DataType>::name() and use the thing introduced in https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3289",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3461#issuecomment-1307815952:1859,avail,available,1859,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3461#issuecomment-1307815952,1,['avail'],['available']

This probably indicates that the method is adapted for very sparse matrices; - The parallel fast matrix product algorithm is always faster than the sequential algorithm, except for very small matrices where the overhead of parallelism is not negligible. However, the speed up is not linear with the number of cores and can be disappointing.; - The parallel fast matrix product is always faster than the regular product even for the matrix of size 1000 and sparsity of 15%, but not for very small matrices (overhead). ______________________________________________________.

Availability," it was provided as an explicit parameter to the method; * later changes refactored this to add new features (such capturing which level of the class hierarchy is creating each Data), and the actual registration of the `Data*` in the list within Base was moved to the Data constructor, where the `Data*` pointer is available so the one from `initData()` became redundant. The newer similar design for initializing BaseLink did use an `initLink()` method without this pointer. And regarding this change:; * a useful aspect of having the pointer to the Data as the first parameter of `initData()` is to unambiguously know the type of the final `Data<T>`, so that there could be (relatively) good compile errors if the type of the provided default value is not matching it. I'm not sure how this PR is affecting / handling that (i.e. if you set a `float` value as a default to a `Data<int>`, how the gcc/clang/msvc error messages look like?); * one drawback in the current design is that there are sometimes bugs introduced by the multiple overloads of `initData()`, because of the ambiguity between the optional default value and the optional pair of bool flags at the end. In particular, for a `Data<std::string>`, calling `initData(&d, ""mydefaultvalue"", ""mydata"", ""help message"")` will incorrectly use the `initData()` version without default value but with one boolean flag, as `""mydefaultvalue""` is a `const char*` which requires a ""user-defined"" conversion to `std::string`, while `""help message""` is implicitely convertible to `bool` without any ""user-defined"" conversion, so preferred by the compiler. So if we break the compatibility to the current `initData()` API, I would strongly suggest to remove this issue, by removing the two optional bool flags which are seldom used anyway (and can be replaced by a call to `setDisplayed()` or `setReadOnly()`).; * compared to when this code was originally written, c++ now allows to put initializers of member variables in the class declaration direct",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3167#issuecomment-1196855283:1631,error,error,1631,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3167#issuecomment-1196855283,1,['error'],['error']
Availability," just need to parse the link's value, follow the path to the linked component's datafield, check its type and that's it), it is a bit trickier when it comes to outputs:; - During the creation of a PSDE's output field, we don't know yet what it's gonna be linked against, so deriving the type is not possible. We have to wait for the creation of the component that will take the PSDE's output as a link to derive it. This means that the steps to derive an output's datatype are the following:. - in Python, in the `parse()` method, call addNewOuput, and give it a datafield name, but no type and an input value field `addNewInput(""MyName"", value="""")`; - in C++, a new datafield is created, but its datatype is void*. To know that this field has been created from a PSDE output, and is not yet properly connected, an alias is added on the data `addAlias(""psde_output"");`; - The next component is created in the scene, a c++ component this time, that knows the type of its inputs. ; - In its parse method, the link is found to the PSDE's output, but its type is incompatible (void* vs vector<Vec3d> for instance). ; - We check if the linked datafield has an alias ""psde_output"" and if so, remove that datafield and recreate it with the same field name, but this time the good datatype; - We set the newly created field as the parent of the parsed datafield in the component. Done. . To do so it was necessary to:; - Make creation of Data possible through a `getNewInstance()` method in Base; - Make BaseData removable from Sofa components in Base `removeData(BaseData*)`; - add in Binding_Base a method called from `addNewIO()` to find a data's type from its value when a link is provided (`deriveTypeFromParentValue()`) ; - Modify Base::parseField() to handle connecting to a parent value that has incompatible type when necessary; - Modify quite a bit the error handling process in addNewData() and parse() (which I hope to have done properly).

Availability," load all the available plugins. Loading a library in the process memory will have several side effects which are difficult to anticipate before hand. The major one is the evaluation of all the global variables, which will result in populating the `ObjectFactory` with all the components that this library contains. I would suggest something different for this kind of having a list of default plugins that are loaded directly with your application ( here `runSofa` ). - derive a sort of sofa plugin manifest file, which can be generated as a post-build step. This should be an easy to parse file which could contain the various informations exposed by the `getModuleName()`, `getModuleVersion()`... without having to load the library in the process memory. This manifest file must be stored in an easy to find location in your build tree, an be installed properly ( they need also to be bundled when you deploy your application ). That means they should be located with a similar relative path with respect to the application ( `runSofa` ) when in the build tree or in the install tree. There should be a proposal about that to define : ; - the manifest file type ( ie how are we going to parse it ? json xml text ? ); - the manifest file content itself. - any application could then define the list of predefined plugin it wants to load using a simple configuration file. A default configuration can be provided, but it could be easily overriden. With this mechanism, no recompilation is required when you want to change the list of default plugins, you just change the config file. NB : a bit unrelated but there is a small code ""snippet"" that can be used to recover all the components attached to a library in two lines ; ```cpp; const char* getModuleComponentList(); {; /// string containing the names of the classes provided by the plugin; static std::string classes = sofa::core::ObjectFactory::getInstance()->listClassesFromTarget(sofa_tostring(SOFA_TARGET));; return classes.c_str();; }; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/253#issuecomment-296982188:2010,recover,recover,2010,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/253#issuecomment-296982188,1,['recover'],['recover']
Availability," most of our code base, dynamic typeinfo (aka the one following the AbstractTypeInfo interface) are available because they only requires opaque data types. And it is only on purpose that developper can include (most of the time in a .cpp) the static typeinfos. So in short...it is abstract by default and static after a specific include. Bying abstract by default ...make that the dependencies is reduced a lot. . This PR:; - add DataTypeId<xxxx> so we can have an unique id per data type. This unique id is statically allocated and is used a way to access the DataTypeInfoRegistry in an efficiant way. ; - add a unique storage repository (DataTypeInfoRegistry). This storage is holding all the typeinfo use in Sofa. There is two way ; to be registered in the repository, the first one consist consist in explcitly adding a typeinfo instance in the storage. This is what to do when we want to be sure the fully defined data type is registered. ; - the other was implemented to mimick at best the the existing behavior in Sofa while fixing some of its error. It works the following way... when a Data<Type> is used this automatically trigs the setting of the typeinfo in the repository. If no DataTypeInfo<> is available this fallback to the default one but the data info cannot be used... if in a subsequent compilation unit (.cpp) the same Data<Type> is used with the complete type, the registring is done again...and if the type is more complete...then the old (partial) type is replaced with the new one. ; - the common data type info are now in their own file in sofa/defaulttype/typeinfo/TypeInfo_XXXX.h/cpp; - the templated code shared between multiple data type info are now in the sofa/defaulttype/typeinfo/models/XXXXX.h; - there is no more dependency to some specific contained data type (eg: RGBAcolor, Vec, Matrice, Set,) in AbstractDataTypeInfo or DataTypeInfo.; - there is a mechanism to get the list of registered typeinfo and wheter the are fully defined or only partially. . ________",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1552:3102,error,error,3102,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1552,1,['error'],['error']

I'm not 100% sure that I found all instances of those calls in Sofa's core, but it seems like it is *exclusively* used with TDataType::Coord and TDataType::Deriv (which are either VecX or RigidCoord/RigidDeriv). In conclusion the usage of DataTypeInfo in BaseData justifies its existence to me. Maybe some features could be isolated in a separate API, but that would only mean maintaining 2 APIs instead of one. I think that instead of trying to remove it from SOFA, we should investigate how to make the API better:; 1. size() / byteSize() / size(void* data) are really unclear (hence the shitty doc on those methods I guess, and it is really hard to know which of these methods serves what purpose. If we base ourselves on the terminology of another data abstraction tool (say numpy), we will still not be able to easily cover complex data types such as sparse matrices easily, but we at least will have a way clearer API to dig into: len, size, shape, ndim...; 2. just like SimpleLayout, we could add a dedicated flag for specific types, to simplify conversions in bindings (Keep the Container flag but maybe add additional ""Matrix"", ""Vector"", and ""Complex"" flags to further discriminate, maybe a SparseMatrix too...; 3. We could add extra pre-filled specializations of DataTypeInfo with clear names to simplify writing new ones (so that we don't have to fill up every flags ourselves everytime); 3. @jnbrunet @damienmarchal what do you think?. ______________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [ ] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [ ] does not generate new warnings.; - [ ] does not generate new unit test failures.; - [ ] does not generate new scene test failures.; - [ ] does not break API compatibility.; - [ ] is more than 1 week old (or has fast-merge label). **Reviewers will merge only if all these checks are true.**",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1385:4055,failure,failures,4055,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1385,2,['failure'],['failures']

They are not using any of specific feature of SingleLink (like path read/writing which is actually invalid behavior as the content of the container is fully defined by the node and cannot be filled with user specified component). . At that time the sole puprose of using SingleLink seems to able to expose the content of these container in the GUI. If this is the case a much simpler code architecture should be used to avoid bloating the Node.h and API. In this PR we replace the Node::Single by the combination of two objects:; - NodeContainerSingle which only handle the ""container"" specific part of the SingleLink; - LinkeableContainer which wrap a container to expose it as a BaseLink. . The advantage of this design is twofold:; - only NodeContainerSingle is needed in Node.h and has a much reduce code-generation compared to SingleLink. ; - NodeContainerSingle can operate with forward declaration (which is not the case of SingleLink which helps to keep clean the inclusion tree.; - there is a clear separation between the Container and the Link part which lead to a very readable code.

Doing that, it allows to actually compile the debug content of both function. And I noticed that they had compilation errors (we could not detect it as SOFA_VERBOSE_TRAVERSAL is never defined). My concerns:. 1. I wanted to use `Visitor::runVisitorTask` in other visitors than BaseMechanicalVisitor. But the logic is not the same. BaseMechanialVisitor is the only visitor checking the tags. Should we always check the tags? Also, the debug boilerplate code is not consistent over all the visitors.; 2. `Visitor::for_each` returns only the result of the last call in the loop. In another loop on the solvers at the beginning of `BaseMechanicalVisitor::processNodeTopDown`, we check the intermediate values. It is not consistent. I suspect that `Visitor::for_each` must also check intermediate values.; 3. In `BaseMechanicalVisitor::processNodeTopDown`, between the process of `mechanicalMapping` and `mechanicalState`, we don't check if `res == RESULT_PRUNE`. It means we do the process of `mechanicalState` even if the process of `mechanicalMapping` returned `RESULT_PRUNE`. It's not consistent with the rest of the code.; 4.

This can happen often: when calling reinit from a c++ program that doesn't use runSofa's GUI for instance.; In order to guarantee that the state is set properly on reinit(), reinit should be a delegate method nested in a method performing the check on the msg_error, and setting the Valid / Invalid flag appropriately.

This compat layer only works for `Data<T>` every types that inherits from it, will only see the original `Data<T>` methods taken into account in the compact layer. This was the case here for `DataFileName` and all `TopologicalData`. . I've decided to adopt two different strategy : ; 1. For `DataFileName` I didn't put my component and still usef the 'setParent' strategy. This is because, a priori, we won't chage a filename data during execution, this is often a given parameter, but we often use methods specific to `DataFileName`. ; 2. For the topological one, usually topological mechanisms are used in very specific classes to handle topological changes. But in a user perspective, it is often used as a classical `Data<vector<Index>>`. So What I did is use `RenamedData` on those, allowing the compat on the `Data<T>` level, but not for the topological methods which are not working anymore on the old symbol (and will create a compilation error if used)... ; ; To make it cleaner we might need to create new `RenamedData` class for all classes inheriting from `Data<T>`.

Availability,"""Solve"" the discrepancy of the regression test of MeshSpringForceField.; Sorting the bboxes of the different levels needs a predicate (a boolean function) to compare two bboxes; https://github.com/fredroy/sofa/blob/master/Sofa/Component/Collision/Geometry/src/sofa/component/collision/geometry/CubeModel.h#L72. But it can happen that v1 == v2 ; and std::sort does not guarantee stability in these cases.; I suppose the result will depend of the implementation of the STL so it would explain the difference between msvc, gcc, clang/lin and clang/mac. By using stable_sort, we can get stability and thus the same results between the different platforms.; Questions are:; - stable_sort is a bit slower than sort https://stackoverflow.com/a/34668459 so set the stability as an option?; - the stability itself seems only relevant is some cases (scenes using penalities?).

The API between them is quite similar but still different:; - value when adding parameter are std::string (instead of the type of the parameter); - implemented a callback system in ArgumentParser because cxxopts does not offer it (boost's name is ""notifier""); - when adding a new parameter boost is ""long_name,short_name"" whereas cxxopts is ""short_name,long_name"". More generally, I tried to hide most of the cxxopts use in ArgumentParser (previously there was a weird mix-up with boost), the only inconvenient place is when adding a new parameter. ## Notes; - Gui (and use of argumentparser) is really.... messy with static functions/variables and unsafe pointer uses here and there.

Availability,"### Description; This PR removes option to apply projective constraints during velocity and/or position propagation visitors, as it makes it unreliable to put projective constraints in child nodes (required when they apply on the DOFs but with a different/subset topology). All codes (solvers and animationloop) must now explicitly call projection operations/visitors before propagations when required (mostly after `OdeSolver::solve())`. This PR is changing the behavior as projective constraints because they are no longer applied at the end of Simulation::init(). To clearly make that visible to calling's code the propagate visitor was renamed to make sure existing codes fail at compilation time. ; To fix that in private/external repos should be easy:; - if projective constraints should not be applied, simply apply the rename to the visitor class; - if projective constraints should be applied, add a MechanicalProject???Visitor first, then rename the existing one.

This is require due to the version of my CUDA (v10.2) from the Sofa docker. Programs containing CUDA libraries of this version require **gcc-8** or less. Sofa compiles with no error, but there is no link to the library _std::filesystem_, as it does not exist for versions lower than **gcc-9.1**.

Main problem is the linear solvers using CSPARSE, which only handles double.; Actually, SparseCholesky was using buffers of float with pointers of double (which obviously causes a crash).; SparseLU is more convenient, it tried to use SReal, and make the compilation failing directly. There were at least two way to solve this problem:; - disable in the CMakeLists directly (if floating_point is float); - do not compile the instance templated on float (effectivement does not compile the two solvers). I chose the latter to keep them visible in the base code, but I totally agree with the former solution (but requires to access to the Cmake variable SOFA_FLOATING_POINT from Sofa.Config in the CMakefile of S.C.LS.Direct).

Availability,"- Task #3770 . Main goal is to remove the ObjectFactory singleton (later) ***and*** the implicit registration of objects while loading dynamic libraries (plugins). In this PR, the explicit registration is applied on components of `Sofa.Component.StateContainer`. The legacy RegisterObject mechanism is preserved and will warn the user at the compilation and at run-time. EDIT:. - add tests about plugins non-registering/registering implicitly/registering explicitly; - add deprecations/warnings in RequiredPlugin; - add a function registerPlugin in PluginManager. This function is simply an alias for loadPlugin() because loadPlugin() does much more than just loading a plugin by itself.

This permits to have clean include directories and thus prevents `find_package` from giving access to unwanted foreign headers.; e.g. doing `find_package(SofaFramework)` will NOT be sufficient to `#include <SofaSomething/anything.h>` (you will get a file not found error).; I think it is way easier to understand that a `find_package` is missing when `#include` fails with ""file not found"" error (at write time if you have a good IDE, at build time otherwise) than with link error (at build time).; Moreover, it will be easier to understand what package is needed for a module by navigating in the include directory.; More details in commit message. ### [[CMake] Make plugins relocatable](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/commit/5b0585f9ad2884cb5462884dffd711ae4d6f2266); **THIS FEATURE IS OPTIONAL**. See the RELOCATABLE parameter of sofa_generate_package.; When building and installing SOFA with plugins - internal (in applications/plugins) or external (included with SOFA_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES) - the plugins will not be mixed with SOFA anymore.; Instead, they will be installed in their own directory under `<install_prefix>/plugins`.; More importantly, they will be relocatable which means they will behave like if they were built out-of-SOFA.; Principal advantage: we will be able to get redistributable plugin binaries through a classic SOFA build. . ### [Defrost binaries ",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1018:1585,error,error,1585,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1018,2,['error'],['error']

Availability,"3 scenes were displaying an error following the PR #2465 . After some investigations, it appeared that those 3 scenes were not working for a while (and the PR merely showed that statement), and the culprit was that GridMeshCreator was not calling its doLoad() method.; doLoad() in MeshLoader components is triggered when d_filename is set.; But GridMeshCreator is procedural and does not any filename at all. Therefore doLoad() was never called.; This PR forcefully set the data d_filename to dirty to force-trigger the callback. Moreover, insertTriangle and insertQuad were using beginEdit()/endEdit() which were triggering also a doLoad() (resulting in a lot of useless edges/triangles); This PR uses WriteOnlyAccessor to avoid this problem.

Availability,":warning: depends on #1488. This refactoring guarantees size consistency between `position / forces / velocity / external_forces` buffers when resized. Since those fields are coupled, changing the size of one should change the size of the others. except it's not the case.; plus, there's a ""size"" datafield that is supposed to determine the size of the buffers. Thus it is now impossible to edit the size of those buffers directly. any insertion / removal of a line in the buffers must be preceded with a change of size, which in turn will redimension the buffers. Also: When creating the scene (before executing the simulation) init_size and init_position should be used.; The idea behind that last change is that we should have separate datafields for inputs and outputs, instead of mixing both concepts together. :warning: **THIS IS BREAKING** because there are probably tons of codes out there that resize position manually and then call` init / reinit / bwdInit` on MOs, hoping for them to update the component (I should know I've been doing it for 6years :D). ______________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [ ] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [ ] does not generate new warnings.; - [ ] does not generate new unit test failures.; - [ ] does not generate new scene test failures.; - [ ] does not break API compatibility.; - [ ] is more than 1 week old (or has fast-merge label). **Reviewers will merge only if all these checks are true.**",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1489:1322,failure,failures,1322,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1489,2,['failure'],['failures']

Availability,"; Problem with the compile version of Sofa using gcc-8 or any version of the ""GNU"" compiler less than 9.1. This is require due to the version of my CUDA (v10.2) from the Sofa docker. Programs containing CUDA libraries of this version require **gcc-8** or less. Sofa compiles with no error, but there is no link to the library _std::filesystem_, as it does not exist for versions lower than **gcc-9.1**.

Creating 2 trackers could create real bugs if topologicalChanges are applied (basically changes will be applied twice); I see several options:; - init should not be applied several times in those examples; - If we decide init could be applied several times, we need to change the code to check tracker are not created twice.

Availability,"> Could you give us more precisions regarding the need to change from enums to strings for the integration methods?. Two reasons motivated the use of strings : ; 1) Right now when specifying the type of numerical integration method in python or xml scripts the user had to use for instance numericalIntegrationMethod=""3"" which is not descriptive at all. It is preferable to use numericalIntegrationMethod=""Tetrahedron Gauss"" for the maintenance of the code. Using OptionsGroup could solve this issue I believe. 2) Inheritance. In the plugin ""SofaHighOrder"" I specify new types of numerical integration methods on triangles. While the APi allows to add a new method, the enum class cannot be extended ( I can use a number like 4 but this creates warnings and is not satisfactory). Therefore using a string class is more versatile. . > **If** the goal is to simplify the conversion from the string (passed in XML / Python scenes) to the C++ enums, wouldn't it be best to take advangate of the OptionsGroup datatype already present in SOFA?.

Availability,"> Thanks @sergeiNikolaev for this contribution and making this nice effort of bringing back this work.; > ; > * Is any test available with these new classes?; > * is there any example scene?. @hugtalbot; Here is the test to verify polynomial springs (Python2 scripts). [polynomial_spring_test.zip](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/files/4540453/polynomial_spring_test.zip). The test ""spring_verification.py"" depicts two points (p1, p2) connected with a spring. One point (p1) is fixed, another (p2) is moving in space. The external impact (f_external) to the system could be applied using LinearForceField (you need to make target_force as a Data<> object in order to collect its information, but I have this modification) or ControlPoint (third point (p_control), attached with a linear rest shape spring). In case of a second option, the external force is computed as (p_control - p2)*k_rest_shape_spring.; During the simulation process, the position ""p2"" and forces ""f2"" for point p2, and also the external force or the position of the control point are saved to data files.; The script ""spring_verification_draw_result.py"" loads all data. The strain for spring is computed as ; (norm(p2-p1) - l0) / l0 for PolynomialSpring or as norm(p2-p1) / l0 for RestShapePolynomialSpring.; I use static solver with many iterations to make spring force equal to external force, but I guess it is also possible to compute the spring force as difference f2 - f_external.; Based on this data, a force-strain relation is plotted and compared with polynomial values.; And this is the end of the test. NOTE: Please, keep in mind, that configuration parameters have to be the same for both scripts, in order to get a valid result.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1342#issuecomment-620055719:124,avail,available,124,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1342#issuecomment-620055719,1,['avail'],['available']

Dear, @hugtalbot,; Thank you for kind supports from you and @epernod. First, I implemented this FF mostly based on two following references:; 1. Book: ""Structural Analysis with the Finite Element Method, Linear static, Vol. 2, chapter 8""; 2. And the most recent paper of our group: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9247533; On the other hand, at this stage, this FF fairly meets our expectations for the current project. I definitely want to improve it in the near future. However, FEM is not my field (I am basically an end-user) and I have been in the middle of something else, therefore, It is gonna take time for me to be able to complete it. I would love to cooperate with SOFA team to complete it.; I'm sorry, but I'm quite unsure when you said rotation around z-axis (normal axis of the element?). Do you mean the consideration of rotating element around its normal axis? (i.e., co-rotational LARGE method (am I right?)). Right now, my priority is to take the rest two rotation dofs of a node (location rotations of around x and y direction) because, at this moment, I assumed they are zeros. But, so far, I have no idea how to include them; Finally, if it is necessary, I am willing to have a face-to-face discussion as long as I am available.

Availability,"@damienmarchal , discussions during the SOFA-dev meeting lead to a question over the developed design and your opinion is needed. . The problem was that some scenes tests where crashing at exit. This is due to the SofaPython3 cache (`s_objectcache` there https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3/blob/1b5d271aa21df06c4c5ab75599e364adb0c1e9be/Plugin/src/SofaPython3/DataHelper.cpp#L252C1-L252C73) . The problem was that this is a static object containing python objects and is thus cleaned at the very end of the program exit, after the python interpreter, which is not authorized. . To fix it, following [pybind11 suggestions](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/misc.html) I've added a member to the module Sofa.Core that insured that the cleanup is called while the interpreter is still alive (see the PR https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3/pull/425). But is was not enough because the interpreter is not cleaned correctly either : the static method ""Release"" of SofaPython3, in charge of cleaning up python and deleting the interpreter was never called when launching scene in runSofa. . This lead to the need of cleaning up *explicitly* the plugin before exiting the main function. This design was not liked by every dev, some wanting a Raii-like cleanup, in the destructor of some member, which is in my mind not possible because the interpreter instance is static in the SofaPython3 plugin and thus we have no guaranty that it would not be deleted before any other static member.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/4828#issuecomment-2233357216:809,alive,alive,809,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/4828#issuecomment-2233357216,1,['alive'],['alive']
Availability,"@damienmarchal ; This is yet another instance of the ""most vexing parse"", which I assume most c++ programmers are familiar with (c++ really is a terrible language).

I agree that it makes it a bit tricky to look into the inner mechanisms of the creation of datafields from the createObject method.; I tried to make it as clear / explicit / fail-safe as possible though: ; - datafields passed through the createObject() function MUST be inputs fields referenced in the `args` dictionnary present in the Python class and there is a nice warning showing up when you try to pass an argument that doesn't exist in the args `dictionary` to createObject; - The user needs to explicitely use the decorator function in the SofaPython module on the parse() method, so he kinda has to know what the decorator does; - The syntax is as close as possible to the syntaxt of normal sofa::core::DataEngines created in python:; ```node.createObject('TransformEngine', input_position='@component.data', translation='0 0 0')```; would translate into; ```node.createObject('PythonScriptDataEngine', input_position='@component.data', translation='0 0 0', filename=__file__, classname='PyTransformEngine')```. I personnally believe it's a must-have feature, because, let's say you have a python scene in which you have to create 5 times the same PSDE component, a custom TransformEngine for instance:; - Without this PR, you would have to create 5 separated classes, with the exact same implementation, just a different value in the addNewInput() in parse().

Availability,"@francoisfaure It is true that having dense matrix blocks is a must-have for some applications, but I wonder about the API: . - for efficiency reasons, we need the DOF types to be available if we want to implement this proposal; - it is quite difficult to recover actual DOF types *from outside* the mapping/forcefield, except when working with a component at the same graph level as the mapping/forcefield, so it seems restrictive to expect the caller to know the DOF types (or is it not?). Which leaves us with the following: back-inserting typed triplets into a container with `template`/overloaded insertion methods, one for each data chunk type. This way the mapping/forcefield DOF types are not part of the API (only the container type is), yet the mapping/forcefield calls the appropriate container method knowing its own DOF types. Of course, the overloaded insertion method must not be `virtual`, which would defeat the whole point. The container must know how to push typed chunks into its internal state (easy), but also how to use/recover it (harder since it needs to remember the types, e.g. for sorting typed triplets later on). This is not unfeasible, but it is not straightforward either. It also adds some complexity/overhead compared to scalar-only back-insertion. Is this worth it? . In order to remember ""typed contexts"" easily, we can draw inspiration from c++14's `std::variant`, where a small integer stores a type index from a variadic argument list, and this index is used for jumping in a static dispatch table.

Availability,"@ggrosshenny ; Thank you for you PR. Being able to save timing in JSON is a very nice idea and as more and more sofa component are using JSON so it make sense to have that. . Now, some feedback about the implementation:; - There is a lot of new functions but there is not test for any of them. . - The way you handle errors in the binding code is now deprecated as it was not following the python standard. The proper way is that failure in binding code must return NULL (and not Py_RETURN_NONE). You can add an execption and a custom message with PyErr_SetString(...) but you don't need to do that when the failure is because of PyArg_ParseTuple...as it set the message itself so that it is standardized. . So, it should be like that: ; ```cpp; if(!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, ""sO"", &id, &tempNode)); return NULL;; ```; Instead of:; ```cpp; if(!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, ""sO"", &id, &tempNode)); {; PyErr_BadArgument();; Py_RETURN_NONE;; }; ```. - You are commenting the python binding code using doxygen, thank you very much for that ! As these are python functions it would be great if you could also provide python docstrings (as this is the python standard of documenting code). You are using the SP_MODULE_METHOD macro which have and empty docstring by default... sofa is missing a macro one to specify the docstring (it exists for SP_CLASS_METHOD_DOC). So to document you functions you first need to add a new macro close to SP_MODULE_METHOD with:; ```cpp; #define SP_MODULE_METHOD_DOC(MODULENAME,M, D) {#M, MODULENAME##_##M, METH_VARARGS, D},; ```; Then you can document the python code in a way similar to when using ""SP_CLASS_METHOD_DOC"". . - the externals libraries should be in the repository extlibs/* so sofa/helper/json.hpp should be moved there. - I have no opinion whether the JSON output should be activated only when the json.hpp is found or if we should systematically ship this lib with sofa. @hugtalbot probably have better opinion on these aspects as this have connection with the Licens",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/360#issuecomment-322555885:317,error,errors,317,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/360#issuecomment-322555885,3,"['error', 'failure']","['errors', 'failure']"

Availability,"@sescaida I just took a look at the code of the ScriptDataEngine class.; You are partially right, the current implementation is the following:. `// Ok, so in the end we're stuck with using the AnimationBeginEvent? (20.02.2018, sescaida); void PythonScriptDataEngine::handleEvent(Event *event); {; if (AnimateBeginEvent::checkEventType(event)); {; setDirtyValue();; update();; }; }`; Here clearly, update is called everytime a AnimateBegin event is sent to the component. If it were a ""normal component"" (i.e. if it were a BaseObject-based component) that would be the only moment that update() method would be called. But the ScriptDataEngine also inherits core::DataEngine.; This is what I talked about during my presentation at the STC#5:; DataEngine both inherits from DDGNode & BaseObject. The update function is ""manually called"" from handleEvent, but it actually shouldn't be, because this is redundant to how DataEngine works, which is having its update() method called **when and only when** a component, taking as an input the output data of that engine, calls getValue() on that data, WHILE any of the engine's INPUTS are flagged dirty. . So basically, while some people call update() in their handleEvent method, this should never be done, except in some (quite) twisted cases.; Btw, it took me quite some time to understand that.. few months ago, all my engines were calling update() in handleEvent, and I had a lot of problems because of that.. ^^. Technically, in the case of the scriptDataEngine, if you remove entirely the call to the update function in handleEvent, and if your dependency graph is well built, you should get the behavior you want",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/629#issuecomment-407008370:899,redundant,redundant,899,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/629#issuecomment-407008370,1,['redundant'],['redundant']
Availability,"@sescaida Thanks for the review; The reason why I didn't add examples for this PR is because the current examples themselves, without any modification, demonstrate that it works as-is, thus showing that the call to update() in the handleEvent method was redundant with the default DDGNode's update mechanism. Basically, if your scene is well created (links are properly made between datafields & data are correctly accessed by components lower in the scene graph), everything should work just as well as before. The only difference I would say, is that the user has the hand over the cleanDirty() method, which allows him to fix use cases where a read acces is performed on an input, after setting an output's value has been set, in update(). as for whether it is a good idea to keep that system, I must say, that I agree with you, as we discussed before: Bringing the complexity of the DDGNode's mechanism in Python might be something we want to avoid.; Although, I think that the good approach to fight this issue would rather be to solve the problem on the C++ side (simplifying the Data-Update mechanism) than to diverge from it by simplifying the Python process.; I think @damienmarchal woul be the best placed to give us a feedback on this question, maybe?

Availability,"@sescaida as a reply to you previous comment:. - I think we should indeed remove the call to update from handleEvent, in the dataEngine. Although there are some twisted cases where it is necessary, it is not how it was designed initially I believe. I'd like @damienmarchal 's input on that, though.; Concerning the default value in addNewOutput, I totally agree with you. The only reason I kept it is because it would have even more impact on the error handling codebase in Sofa, which currently forces the existence of a ""value"" field to guarantee that the datatype can be deduced (which we are bypassing for outputs..); Overall, I think there's a decent amount of cleaning to do in this PR before it can be merged, including removing all the warnings that appear because we're working our way around the ""standard"" way to build datafields.; - I also agree with you that we need some reviews on this PR, and maybe also split it in multiple PRs for simpler reviewing.

Availability,"@sescaida, you can find [here](https://github.com/marques-bruno/snippets/blob/master/testDataEngine.cpp) a test code for Sofa showing what happens when cleanDirty is called at the wrong moment. After testing a little bit the engines, I noticed that the only case where it wouldn't work (to have all the data updates & cleanDirty() before calling the update() method would be in the very unlikely case where the update() method would fetch an earlier engine in the dependency graph through getContext, and set its output value. this is very unlikely, which means that, apart for some performance reasons, I don't see why it would be important to bind the cleanDirty() method in python. Since python is much slower anyway, I think this PR does not make much sense anymore. although, I still insist on removing the call to update() from handleEvent, since it is redundant with its normal on-demand calling mechanism. :) I'll update the PR soon!",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/751#issuecomment-417357372:859,redundant,redundant,859,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/751#issuecomment-417357372,1,['redundant'],['redundant']

Availability,@thomas-lemaire currently I see that some components are doing; ```cpp; if(printLog) sout << ; ```; While the 'sout' is already checking the printLog which is redundant. This is what I'm refering as mis-usagse. To me the cleaning consist in defining what is the right pattern to employ and this may (or not) result in removing the if(printLog) from the component and replace them with the use of 'sout'. . About the link with PR106. With the PR a dedicated message handler has to be installed in the application or the scene to activate loggin into component... this is done with the following code ; ```cpp; MessageDispatcher::addHandler(&MainPerComponentLoggingMessageHandler::getInstance()) ;; ```; But currently this is not done in runSofa or any other app and the messages are not added to the log. This is why I'm saying the PR is independent and is without side effect. . When the printLog expected behavior is clear the current log 'to the big string' should be removed and replaced by installing the logging proposed in PR106.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/160#issuecomment-276932662:159,redundant,redundant,159,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/160#issuecomment-276932662,1,['redundant'],['redundant']
Availability,"@thomas-lemaire please be tatillon because it is a good question :) . Initially it was not part of the PR (have a look at the first commit to see what was my initial code) but on windows the static_asserts were causing compilation failure on V2015 and VS2013 builds. After some digging and request for discussions (in issue: https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/130)) my conclusion was that the failure was not because of my code but because that somehow there was implicit instanciation of the function like Vec<4,float>::set(...,...,N...) with N!=4. And as they were instanciated this was causing the static_assert to reject the code when N==4. . I have the feeling that the static_assert in Vec was only working because of side effects on way compiler interleave optimization and instantiation of templates (but I may be totally wrong). Basically all the set(...,) function are present but they were removed because they were not used before the check by static_assert. .

Availability,"A bit of explanation about this PR:; When a attribute is passed to createObject, it is added to the BaseObjectDescription of the component. This means that, in cpp, the parse() method, that takes a BaseObjectDescription in parameter, has this information. The problem is, that in the PythonScriptDataEngine, the parse method calls the python version of the parse() method, which doesn't take this BaseObjectDescription in parameter (maybe that should change btw, since its mainly a simple key/value dictionnary after all...); The datafields could be added directly from the C++, but since most of the error handling in the creation of derived I/Os in #742 is performed in the bindings, it would mean recoding a lot of redundant code.; Since I didn't want to touch the parse() method, I created an additional method, that can (or not) be used in PSDEs, named ""datalinks"". This method is called right after the parse() binding, and takes a filtered version of the BaseObjectDescription as an argument (all datafields already created in the parse() method are removed from the dictionnary). The function then calls addNewInput() on each of the leftover fields. I'm certain there is a cleaner way of doing that.; - I was thinking maybe calling directly the python addNewInput() method from the cpp parse() method, to avoid the creation of this extra module function, but I am not sure I know how to do that. ; - Another idea would be to pass the BaseObjectDescription in the parse() method of the PSDE (as it should be done IMHO), and let the user decide whether or not he wants to loop over those fields to create inputs.. more error prone in my opinion.

Availability,"A new DataEngine is introduced: `FillReducingOrdering`. A DataEngine to reorder the degrees of freedom in a mesh in order to reduce fill-in in sparse matrix factorization. In other terms, the algorithm minimizes the number of non-zeros entries in the factorization of the sparse matrix of a FEM problem by reordering the degrees of freedom. The implementation is based on METIS. Note: some of the direct linear solvers embed such a reordering internally (e.g. SparseLDLSolver), but not all of them (e.g SparseLUSolver, SparseCholeskySolver etc). An example is also introduced (`examples/Components/engine/FillReducingOrdering.scn`).; Here is the comparison of the two system matrices:. Initial matrix:; ![initial_matrix00001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10572752/143068764-2cbd09b4-906b-4bc1-b3c6-03cd3034a1ab.jpg).

Availability,About failure by default on warning & deprecated...this is a choice. . The positive thing about this 'bold' behavior is that it force tests maker to care about warning and deprecated messages otherwise they tend to ignore them. As I prefer to specify explicitely in every test case the expected behavior I dont' feel very concerned about that 'default mode'. ; But I think this 'bold' behavior sound nice to me and from the new failure we can see in the test reports this mode is rising interesting issue that requires investigations. About the disable color while testing. I disable it only for the tests to see if it improve the readability. Now red in the console only means that a test have failed and it not obfuscated with the red from an expected error message. (I 'm not sure I'm clear here). You can change that if you prefer :) .

Availability,"Based on #2043. A new component is introduced: `ParallelBVHNarrowPhase`. As the name suggests, it is the parallel implementation of `BVHNarrowPhase`. ## Details. The broad phase provides a list of pairs of collision models. In the initial `BVHNarrowPhase` component, the list was processed sequentially. In `ParallelBVHNarrowPhase` each pair is processed in a task, which is given to a thread pool. Note that the traversal of the bounding volume hierarchy is not parallel. It is still single threaded. Due to race conditions, some operations must be done prior to the parallel tasks: . 1. Detection output creation. This operation is very time consuming (see #2047). If #2047 is merged, we can expect better results.; 2. Topology initialization. ## Results. The tested scene is `applications/plugins/MultiThreading/examples/ParallelBruteForceBroadPhase.scn` during 500 time steps.

Availability,"Based on #3548 . Similar to ParallelHexahedronFEMForceField. `addDForce` and `addKToMatrix` are the parallelized functions.; `addForce` is not parallelized. It would require to duplicate code from the base class. Hence a refactoring is needed for a proper implementation (in another PR). Note that `addForce` is usually not the bottleneck. Quick benchmarks show performances improvement on the provided example. I think there is still room for improvement in `addDForce`. But it would require a few changes in the base class. Instead of having a force vector for each task, I suggest to store only the force on the DoFs that have been visited during the task. I am not sure if it will bring more perfs improvements. In this PR, `addKToMatrix` is parallelized. It is not in `ParallelHexahedronFEMForceField`, but the same principle can be applied (in another PR). ______________________________________________________.

The conversion gets triplets and detects duplicates and does the compression. Therefore, all the work to build a matrix is done in the conversion. This work is not required during the accumulation as it is done later in any case. I propose to accumulate all the matrix entries in a simple list. This accumulation does nothing else than inserting a new element in the vector. This should be faster than using a `CompressedRowSparseMatrix`. ______________________________________________________.

Availability,"Based on https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3548. In the `addDForce` method, the parallel algorithm consists in computing a thread-specific `dF` and then combine them all in the main `dF`. It requires a synchronisation mechanism as it may create race conditions. This PR introduce an alternative method which is lock-free. It divides the model into smaller subdomains that can be solved in parallel without synchronization. Since the domains are visited sequentially (it's the elements of each domain that are visited in parallel), it comes with an overhead. Therefore, this method is particularly suited for large models where the overhead can be amortized. I have the following results on the provided example:. ```; 1000 steps ; 17775 elements (hexa). domain decomposition:; 35.1703 s ( 28.4331 FPS). naive:; 76.5666 s ( 13.0605 FPS). sequential:; 192.688 s ( 5.18974 FPS).; ```.

Availability,"CImgData.h only contains classes and things related to the image plugin.; Thats why it seems more consistent to move this file directly into the image plugin. Moreover, it had a non-met (soft) dependency on SofaBaseVisual (as there is no cpp, and it is only used by the image plugin, this was not an issue before). IMO, CImgPlugin should be only a plugin:; - introducing the cimg library; - using cimg, allowing loading various picture file format (jpg/png, etc).

Availability,"CRSMultiMatrixAccessor was isolated in #2220 and was make compilable by default.; The only case where it could be used is in MatrixLinearSolver by defining a macro (SOFA_SUPPORT_CRS_MATRIX), but this one was never defined so effectively the CRSMultiMatrixAccessor was never used (even if compiled). Thing is, CRSMultiMatrixAccessor takes a **loooong** time to compile (and takes heap of memory).; The reason is that it needs to compile ~~(6 * 6 * 6 * 2 * 2) * 2 = **1728**~~ functions because of chains of template. (EDIT actually it is even more than that: `(6 + (6*6) + (6*6*6) + (6*6*6*2) + (6*6*6*2*2)) * 2` = **3108**). So in the end, either you want to compile it and use it, or dont use it but dont compile it... ; A cmake (advanced) option is introduced for people who really wish to use it.; By the way CRSMultiMatrixAccessor code quality is very dubious (const_cast<> everywhere...), ; and the english comments are.... _special_.

Availability,"Compiling sofa with SOFA_FLOATING_POINT_TYPE=double (no float) leads to a series of compile errors in Mapping and MultiMapping. I believe the bug has been introduced in PR #738. The reason for this crash is that some Mappings double->float are necessary for some applications (usually for visual models, CUDA, etc.).; Thus ExtVecXfTypes are always compiled, even when #ifndef SOFA_FLOAT. This PR fixes the bug, but also raises an important underlying point:; Having ifndefs everywhere in the code is very intrusive, source of errors, and most importantly, prevents having a full code coverage in the CI in a single build. Floats are slower, and much less precise than Doubles. We do not support XBox / PS3 code, thus we have one less reason to keep this code smell in the core of sofa.; If the only reason we still need floats is for Cuda compatibility and other visual rendering stuff, shouldn't the conversions be done in those components / plugins, instead of having this FLOAT things affecting the whole codebase of SOFA?.

Availability,Create a Camera component so that it become possible to render a scene. The difference with InteractionCamera is that the Camera component is not having any interaction so you can implement; your own 'application specific behavior' by using an external Controller (eg: PythonScriptController). Changes:; - the BaseCamera now has a link to a BackgroundSetting so multiple camera can have multiple background. ; - the BaseCamera now implement a draw() method. If you don't want to see what is drawn...then; restrict the rendering of your scene graph to only call drawVisuals() which is what it is supposed to do :) ; - the Camera alias is not anymore creating an InteractionCamera but a Camera object.

Availability,"Currently in Sofa the Link implementation is very hard to maintain because; in a single implementation based on type-traits we are trying to handle to object; of different nature that are BaseData and Base. Link between Base is used everywhere in Sofa but a Link between two data; is only to hold the parent of a Data. It is questionable if such complex; implementation for Link is needed for just this single use case ?. Not doing that have a lot of consequence:; - Data implementation is simpler (because it is no needed to have Class ); - Link implementation is much simpler (and Link is used everywhere); - The instanciation of Link is time consuming in the compilation process and; requieres a lot of #include<> making the dependency graph more dense and thus; slow to compile.

Availability,"Currently in Sofa we are using a lot the ""call super"" design pattern as in:; ```cpp; class BaseObject; {; public:; virtual void init(); { ; checksDataFields(); ; }. virtual void draw() {} ; };; class MyObject : public BaseObject; {; public:; void init() override; {; componentState = Invalid; BaseObject::init(); /// .......... do here the object specific initialization.; if(error); {; emitMessage(); componentState = Invalid; return;; } ; componentState = Valid; }; ; void draw() override ; {; if(componentState != valid); return; /// ......... do here the drawing ; } ; }; ```; This pattern used for init() and draw() has several drawbacks. The most problematic is that it delegates to the child classes the role of guaranting the correctness (ie: the child musn't forget to call BaseObject::init in MyObject::init). Doing so, at the right location(begin, end fo the init) also force the child to ""know"" what the super::init implementation is doing (to not duplicate) and that the implementation of BaseObject::init() will not change. . This kind of pattern can be replace with the ""delegate pattern"" (not sure this is its official name). Which leads to:; ```cpp; class BaseObject; {; public:; void init(); { ; checksDataFields(); ; doBaseObjectInit();; setComponentStateOnError();; }; ; void draw(); {; if(componentState != valid); return; doBaseObjectDraw(); ; }; private:; virtual void doBaseObjectInit() {}; virtual void doBaseObjectDraw() {}; };. class MyObject : public BaseObject; {; public:; void doBaseObjectInit() override final; {; /// do here the object specific initialization without bothering of what your parent is doing. ; }; ; void doBaseObjectDraw() override final; {; /// do here the object specific drawing without bothering of what your parent is doing. ; }; }; ```; The latter pattern allows to implement a general behavior in a parent class and be sure this behavior is never broken up by ; the child. .

Availability,"Currently in Sofa we aren't catching any exceptions. . The consequence is that every exception propagates to the top level exception handler halting the application. ; Un-handled exception are useful to detect bugs but this is a non-sense to use such top level handler to process possible application errors like failure to load a plugin or a scene. . A good approach should be that any exception that can be fixed without editting the source code (ie. but by editting the scene or changing some system configuration and so on) should ends with a gracefull error message indicating to the user how to fix the error cause. To implement this I suggest to:; - add a close to top-level try/catch block around simulations/plugin actions; - add a SofaSimulationException that has an error message, the component that emitted it and can have a backtrace as well as a top level reactions to do (eg: set componentstate to invalid and stop simulation). We should also use this SofaSimulationException at any place we are using msg_error(). ; (Actually it could even make sense to replace the msg_error macro by throwing the exception). ______________________________________________________.

Availability,"Explicit instantiations of common `Mat` sizes led to compilation errors. For example, `z()` throws a `static_assert` for `Mat<2,2,>` because there is only 2 elements. Now, `x`, `y`, `z` and `w` are compiled conditionally. Other methods, such as `Identity`, `transpose` etc, are also concerned for squared matrices. The `static_assert` are therefore no longer useful. . `Identity` has been changed so it is `static constexpr` and it returns a reference. So there is no need to compute the identity matrix each time it is called. `s_identity` is now deprecated. The static variable is now included in the `Identity` method. It is better for static initialization fiasco and required for a `constexpr` context. Also, `s_identity` does not make sense for rectangular matrices. Since it is not possible to conditionally add a class member, it is hidden in the conditionally compiled method `Identity`. In `fixed_array`, the `operator<` is moved out of the class. This allows to compile this operator only when used, and not in explicit instantiations. This is necessary because the operator on `fixed_array<Vec3>` is not implemented (and does not make sense). The 3x3 matrix product and the `multTranspose` operation are specialized for a speedup. https://github.com/alxbilger/SofaBenchmark was used. Results show that this implementation is closer to the Eigen implementation. Unit tests are added.

Availability,"FWIW at Anatoscope we've been using exceptions for quite a while now, and we generally `std::throw_with_nested` to provide additional context as exceptions bubble up (this is handy when pulling on long engine/data chains) to help debugging scene issues. One of the main issues is to get proper exception translation across c++/python boundaries (both ways) while retaining as much of the original error as possible. IMHO the ""expected"" approach is currently lacking on ergonomics (unlike say, haskell or rust's equivalents) and will probably put some more pressure on compile times if used widely. On the other hand it does solve some of the pain points with exceptions (types/speed). I recall there was some discussion in the C++ committee a few years back in order to have some kind of lightweight exception mechanism (see e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os7cqJ5qlzo) but this is still mostly future work as far as I can tell.

Availability,"FYI, the decision back in the sofa coding sprint of June 2014 (as fas as I remember), was to remove all `*GridTopology`, in favor of a new design based on `*GridLoader` or `*GridEngine` types of components. A workgroup worked on this topic during the sprint. The associated branch may or may not still exist, but unfortunatly it was not completed and merged back. The rational however is still valid, the current design of those topologies introduce many complexities that are not providing a lot of value, given how rarely then end-up being used, outside of quick and useful examples, but for which the performance gain (if any) of using these grids directly instead of using `MeshTopology` or `HexahedronSetTopologyContainer` does not really matter. So in term of maintenance it seems more practical to remove them completely from the codebase, once we have a usable (and simpler) alternative in place.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/162#issuecomment-281638098:766,mainten,maintenance,766,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/162#issuecomment-281638098,1,['mainten'],['maintenance']

Availability,"Factories were used only with `std::string` as a key. That is why it was not noticeable that factories were not compatible with other types than `std::string` as the key.; The limitations come from:. - `logFactoryRegister` assumed `Key` is a string. It is now a template function.; - `Creator` inherits from `Key` and instances was used such as it was a string. Now, `Creator` no longer inherits from `Key` but just stores the key as a class member. A unit test is added for enum type as a key. Small downside: `std::string& getFactoryLog()` is now available outside the translation unit. ______________________________________________________.

Same problem with drawTriangle and drawPoint,; I suppose that these functions, at the beginning, was just needed to factorize OpenGL code (but still you needed to use OpenGL with it). ; Now that we remove the explicit calls, those functions should not be accessible outside.; But a few code in Sofa (and maybe plugins?) are using those calls to draw one primitive. Finally, what have been done:; - remove public visibility to those functions and rename it to internalDrawXXXX (where XXXX is point, triangle, quad); - keep the old calls to keep compatibility; - add addLine to keep consistency with the other primitives. I am wondering if in the future (or just right now), the drawXXX (drawing ONE primitive) should be removed and force users to use the drawXXXXs with a vector (and oblige user to build a std::vector with ONE primitive. ______________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [x] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [x] does not generate new warnings.; - [x] does not generate new unit test failures.; - [x] does not generate new scene test failures.; - [x] does not break API compatibility.; - [ ] is more than 1 week old (or has fast-merge label). **Reviewers will merge only if all these checks are true.**",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/293:1239,failure,failures,1239,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/293,2,['failure'],['failures']

I made them disabled, if somebody wants to fix them... ### 4; Sofa.Helper does not need boost::thread anymore and thus is removed from the CMake files.; ______________________________________________________.

Availability,"Following a recent update of my fork from SOFA master, I observed a strange behaviour in the GUI while running a scene of mine where I'm doing catheter navigation (similarly to BeamAdapter). Namely :; - Before, Ctrl was the default key to use interactive controls, for instance `Ctrl+uparrow` was caught by `if event['key'] == chr(19)` in my Python controller. Now `uparrow` is caught by the same line.; - Before, keeping `Ctrl+uparrow` pushed down was automatically playing the control over and over (until the key was released). Now I have to release the key (`uparrow`) and press it again to redo the control. Talking with @fredroy, it seems that I'm not the only one to have observed this problem, so it might come from a PR undesirable side effect. Additionally, it apparently doesn't come from SofaPython3. Regarding the master, all I can say is that the previous update I made was on the 30/09/2022 (so I didn't have this issue at the time), and that the issue appeared after my last update on the 24/11/2022. I briefly went through the merged PR in between these dates, but could find one which could be incriminated. I'm working on Ubuntu (20.04). It is also worth mentioning that I did some other updates during the time lapse (basically, all default updates suggested by Ubuntu's Software Updater), but no major change in any software version.

A base class for TopologicalMapping is introduced (BaseTopologicalMapping). It has no link to topologies. SubsetMultiMapping is now a BaseTopologicalMapping and has MultiLinks for input topologies and output topologies.; The consequence is that SubsetMultiMapping gets the propagation of the topological changes through the visitor `TopologyChangeVisitor`. It does not need any callback and subscribe to any topology. Note that `TopologyChangeVisitor` is now called on the root, rather than on the Node of the topology undergoing changes.

Availability,"Following the issue #183 , this is a proposed solution since the issue is starting to date and is still present on OS X. Don't hesitate to refuse it if you prefer to go with another solution. At least now this fix will be publicly seen by people who wish to get a fast fix for the bug. This is a small change that forces the GUI to use the Qt menu instead of the native one for Mac OS X. This feature is available for other operating system by disabling a new cmake option named ""SOFAGUI_ENABLE_NATIVE_MENU"" (the name matches the other gui related cmake options). This cmake option is true by default on every OSes except Mac OS X (Darwin). . Since I think that many people execute runSofa directly in the build directory instead of a bundled mac application (.app), this should fix the unresponsive menu bug. Note that the menu will be displayed directly onto the GUI instead of the native menus of OS X GUI. Note also that I didn't test this feature on Windows since I don't own a license. It does work well on Gnome shell based linux distro last time I checked. But anyway, the feature is disabled on other OSes than OS X, so it shouldn't change anything for those who use Windows or Linux. If some people could help me by testing this feature on Windows and some Linux desktop environments, that would be great and bullet proofing the feature for people who wish to use the Qt menus even if they are not with OS X.; ______________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [x] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [x] does not generate new warnings.; - [x] does not generate new unit test failures.; - [x] does not generate new scene test failures.; - [x] does not break API compatibility.; - [x] is more than 1 week old (or has fast-merge label). **Reviewers will merge only if all these checks are true.**",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/366:404,avail,available,404,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/366,3,"['avail', 'failure']","['available', 'failures']"

Availability,"For historical explanations:; * we need to gather the pointers to all Data in a Base instance, so there must be a function somewhere that is called with both the pointer to the `Base*` object and to the `Data*`.; * a simple option could be to have the `Base*` pointer as a parameter of the Data constructor, however most compilers issue a warning if `this` is explicitly used when initializing member variables, as it is not fully constructed yet; * however, compilers are happy with calling a method, which itself use `this`, hence the initial implementation of `initData()` (which was called `dataField()`) had the `this` pointer implicitely, but needed the `Data*` pointer to add if to the ""fields"" map, which is why it was provided as an explicit parameter to the method; * later changes refactored this to add new features (such capturing which level of the class hierarchy is creating each Data), and the actual registration of the `Data*` in the list within Base was moved to the Data constructor, where the `Data*` pointer is available so the one from `initData()` became redundant. The newer similar design for initializing BaseLink did use an `initLink()` method without this pointer. And regarding this change:; * a useful aspect of having the pointer to the Data as the first parameter of `initData()` is to unambiguously know the type of the final `Data<T>`, so that there could be (relatively) good compile errors if the type of the provided default value is not matching it. I'm not sure how this PR is affecting / handling that (i.e. if you set a `float` value as a default to a `Data<int>`, how the gcc/clang/msvc error messages look like?); * one drawback in the current design is that there are sometimes bugs introduced by the multiple overloads of `initData()`, because of the ambiguity between the optional default value and the optional pair of bool flags at the end. In particular, for a `Data<std::string>`, calling `initData(&d, ""mydefaultvalue"", ""mydata"", ""help message"")` w",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3167#issuecomment-1196855283:1034,avail,available,1034,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/3167#issuecomment-1196855283,2,"['avail', 'redundant']","['available', 'redundant']"

Availability,"Hello François (@fjourdes),. Thank for the long and interesting reply. . Your last comment rise an interesting question related to differentiating unittest to functionnal tests. ; Currently in Sofa we don't make any distinction between unit test and functionnal test but my thinking is that in general utility classes have unit tests while components have functional tests . Making the distinction would be indeed better so the question is how to get there from where we are a now. Here is a proposal. ; In the current PR there is a ```BaseTest``` and ```BaseSimulationTest```, this could actually be transformed without too much effort into UnitTest and FunctionalTest. The tests inheriting from UnitTest shouldn't use the factory in any way and shouldn't have external dependencies. The test in-heriting from FunctionalTest should use the factory and can make the assumption that specific plugins are loaded. We could event go one step further and emphasizing things by having two set of file, ones named *MyClass_unittest.cpp* and *MyComponent_functionaltest.cpp* and in our CMakeLists.txt compile the two set of tests separately with different build targets. This would make things very clear, be compatible with your workflow where unit test are considered as compilation failure, be compatible with our workflow where functional tests are used because they allow to get decent code coverage and last point as it would use the loose coupling approach it would totally cut the dependency at compile time to SofaTest. . Small note, some Functional tests may rely on components implemented in plugins. I have not clear view if we should disable the test if the plugin is not there or if we should make it fails or if we should ""disable"" it at runtime. .

Availability,"Hello François, . Here is a summary of my current understanding of your comments. ; It seems that you want to:; 1 - cut the dependency to SofaTest; 2 - have a clear separation between unittest vs functionaltest; 3 - cut the dependency to SofaFramework (ie not having the test inheriting from SofaFramework/BaseTest or something like that) for the unittests. . Initially this PR was only about -1- cutting the dependency to SofaTest. My thinking is that the SofaTest dependency is a major problem for everyone using the master branch of sofa because of the high impact on code coupling. . About -2- Following your remarks I'm in favor of improving a more clear separation between unit-test and functional test but as this is something new and maybe this should discussed that in the ""issues"" section of github instead of inside a specific PR. . About -3- cutting the dependency to SofaFramework. This is something that was never discussed before and worse than that, up to now the general consensus that, as we are in Sofa, we should inherit from a single BaseTest that install all the may be needed to do the test. A good reason for this scenario is nothing related to Scene/Simulation management but because BaseTest provides a default handler for EXPECT_MSG_EMIT/NOEMIT. Of course if your code is not using at all those elements, then you should feel free to use gtest. . As said in previous comment compared to the current Sofa code base I would be very happy to have -1- and -2- done. . It seems that -3- is not a big deal for people using the CMakelists.txt from Sofa but it may be of importance for your specific workflow in which, if I understand your previous answers, you integrate unittest as compilation failure. Maybe you can provide us more details on your workflow so that we can see the drawback of having the tests written in SofaFramework to be inheriting from a BaseTest (which is also defined in SofaFramework).

Availability,"Hello François,. Thanks for the PR, my bad. To answer your question the CI is compiling Sofa in debug on linux...so this rise the question why we didn't notice that before ? . I look at the code and this bug being un-noticed for so long result from interesting side effect ; so here are the details:; In LCPCalc.cpp I replaced the function afficheResult by resultToString; In LCPCalc.h I forgot to remove the afficheResult; In ConstraintAnimationCode.cpp the calling code is; ```cpp; if (EMIT_EXTRA_DEBUG_MESSAGE); {; msg_info() << ""getF() after setConstraintEquations:"" ;; helper::afficheResult(CP.getF()->ptr(),CP.getSize());; }; ```; The remarquable thing is that this is not and #ifdef but a normal if. So the problematic code *is* compiled and as the definition is in the .h, everything is fine (at compilation time). Let's now have a look at how is defined the condition, there we have:; ```cpp; #define EMIT_EXTRA_DEBUG_MESSAGE false; ```; This means the code is really compiled but that during the optimization pass (that take place before linking) the bloc of code is removed because it is unreachable. So at link time the call is not there anymore. ; To have the link error happens you either need to set the condition to true (it is not connected with debug flags so you have to manually change that in the .cpp) or to use a compiler that does not do unreachable code removal (maybe a compiler option or something). . So your PR really fix the problem . Now to conclude:; - I'm happy to see that the compiled successfully optimize if(true/false) condition so we can use them much more to replace #ifdef / #endif whenever possible (more readable, easier to maintain). ; - the EMIT_EXTRA_DEBUG_MESSAGE is not linked in any way to the debug compilation...should it be ?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/473#issuecomment-336552959:1178,error,error,1178,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/473#issuecomment-336552959,1,['error'],['error']
Availability,"Hello Marc, and thanks a lot for your feedback !. I'll address some of your points below:. > **determinism**: as @matthieu-nesme mentionned, the order of initialization of objects with static storage duration is undefined across translation units. This is the first reason why I introduced the init() functions: to make initialization deterministic and reliable. And this is the same reason why it's better to call those functions explicitely, at the right time: the program will work correctly by design, not by coincidence;. To be more explicit: there is no guarantee whatsoever that calling `init` in a `static` RAII constructor will get called *after* every other `static` variable in the shared library is initialized. This can indeed be an issue. I was under the impression that there is exactly one of such RAII per dynamic library loaded by SOFA, so as long as `init` does not involve messing around with other `static` variables in the library we should be safe, right?. > **readability** (or something like that): calling the initialization function ""manually"" makes programs more readable: you can just start from the main() function and understand what code is going to run without actually running the code inside a debugger (or reading the entirety of SOFA's source code);. Come on, we're talking about SOFA here ;-). > **choice** (or whatever): with an explicit call to init(), an application writer gets to decide both whether and when to initialize SOFA. Not sure I agree: when `dlopen`-ing a shared library, I prefer to have it initialized automatically if possible (and safe) as the converse is error-prone. In any case, `cleanup` should really be called in the RAII destructor, otherwise resources will leak in case an exception is thrown and not caught, or somebody calls `std::exit` (which they *can*). And of course, the destructor should not do silly stuff like calling a `MessageDispatcher` that was destructed already.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/168#issuecomment-280066333:353,reliab,reliable,353,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/168#issuecomment-280066333,2,"['error', 'reliab']","['error-prone', 'reliable']"
Availability,"Hello all,. This PR adds (hopefully) proper GIL handling to `SofaPython`, so that it is possible to run python threads concurrently with the main Sofa program. It enables the following scene to run concurrently with the main program: . ```python; def createScene(node):. from threading import Thread; import time; ; def target():; while True:; time.sleep(1); print(""it's aliiive!""); ; thread = Thread(target = target); thread.daemon = True; thread.start(). time.sleep(2); ```. This is achieved through the RAII class `PythonEnvironment::gil`, which is meant to protect the boundaries between c++ and python code as follows:. ```c++; // some function called from the c++ side; {; PythonEnvironment::gil lock;; // safely call python functions here: the GIL ; // is acquired and released automatically; }; ```. The trick is that the GIL should also be released prior to the first lock so that the last object to unlock the GIL gives an opportunity to python threads to run, if any. Otherwise, the main thread still holds the GIL after the last lock is destroyed, and python threads never get to run. This is a work in progress, but should be pretty harmless and easy to disable if something goes wrong.

Availability,"Hello, in my opinion, this bug is related to the actual status of solvers in SOFA. Since CG is a very ""robust"" solver (where ""robust"" means that it constructs solutions which are mathematically not always justifiable), it is used everywhere in examples. However, there are other solvers available in SOFA (even if not used often), such as SparseLDL, SparseLU. I think it might be highly ""surprising"" for someone that while CG calculates some solution (which IMHO is not mathematically justifiable, but let's put this aside), LDL or LU will simply crash on such as simple scene without saying anything clear about the reason of crashing. Or to put it differently -- the above scene is not well-formed (a non-mapped MO in a subnode...), but if using CG, everything looks fine (even IMHO it really should not).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/581#issuecomment-390928123:103,robust,robust,103,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/issues/581#issuecomment-390928123,3,"['avail', 'robust']","['available', 'robust']"

So this is not something that was really meant to be preserved like that, indeed it does not make sense that the value is much higher for double that floats. But the actual refactoring that is needed is to expose this tolerance as a Data instead of hiding it within the code itself, so that it can be tuning within the simulations that require it instead of requiring a patch within Sofa.

Availability,"Hello,. I saw that several PRs are in work that move potentially lots of source files into plugins (#396, #407, #408, #477).; These types of changes can be very painful for everyone looking at file histories and/or not working exclusively on master:; - all existing branches / PRs are very likely to cause conflict. Yes git does its best to try to match files in different paths but this is not reliable at all. Example issues: it won't move files that are created in the same directories in other branches/PRs, you have to be expert in all the rename match heuristics within git in order to be able to use merge with 10s of commits with mismatching file hierarchies (and there is none that I know of that will work well enough to be always used); - the history of all affected files will be polluted by this move. Example: it is tricky to know the history of all the SofaKernel files before May 2016 [(example)](https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/commits/master/SofaKernel/framework/sofa/core/BaseState.h) (can someone remind me what we gained by this massive move?

And as a counter-proposal, for discussion, that you are free to ignore, I would suggest a 3 steps approach :. 1. First only change the CMake scripts / per-lib main header/cpp to convert them to plugins WITHOUT moving the actual source files; 2. Document the proposed new directory hierarchy, propose it and wait for feedback from enough community members; 3. Once there is an agreement on the hierarchy, apply it via a commit that does not change anything else (changes in cmake scripts should be done as a separate commit, to ease solving later merge/conflict issues).

Availability,"Hello,. The issue I have with this approach is that this make it very invasive, as Sofa is adding operators in std namespace for all types, even not its own. So within an application that could also does the same, we would get conflicts / redefinition / ambiguity compiler errors, or worse silently override the application's own operators that could have relied on a different string syntax. I agree that the approach of subclassing the standard containers just to be able to package them within a Data is wrong. In our current branch we are refactoring the approach, relying more on `DataTypeInfo` to generically access features like string parsing, without having to put them in the type itself.

Availability,"Here is a new plugin which implements a beam force field component with plastic behaviour (to model nonlinear and permanent deformation). The general structure is inspired from the BeamFEMForceField component. At the moment, I kept the new component in a dedicated plugin (BeamPlastic), but I guess it could be moved to where the BeamFEMFF component already is (providing the PR is mergeable). Two pull-requested files (in applications/plugins/BeamPlastic/quadrature) were implemented by someone else and published under the open source Boost Software License 1.0 (BSL-1.0). I mentioned this in both files headers, but I don't know if the BSL-1.0 is compatible with the SOFA license. If not, these files can be removed and I can re-implement the corresponding methods (for reduced gaussian integration).

However, I also want to include these components in the calculation but have no clue. Furthermore, only the small displacement method is considered, I just wonder whether we can apply the co-rotational method to this type of element.

If no path are specified, check the INI file if it has one, if not then gray-out the options for ffmpeg output. If it is a valid path (checked during runtime), then save that path in the INI file.

Availability,"Hey @maxime-tournier ,. You bring valuable points here. You are absolutely right, it is not that trivial, I'm starting to see it now. Here is what I observed during my tests (I'm working part time on this, it is entirely possible that I come back later to correct those statements of mine :) ). > you need to properly initialize/finalize sofa and core modules (see Main.cpp in the runSofa application). Yes. I'm usually leaning towards making most of the functions available and let the script use what it need. So if I'm writing a _runSofa_ like application in python, I should be able to init the components there, create/set the simulation, add the needed message handlers to the MessageDispatcher, and set the paths (plugin, config, sofa prefix) there. If this complicate too much the python script, than making optional python util scripts that set all of this for the user could be a clean option. But I don't think the library should do this in the user's back without transparency. > you need to handle the case where the loaded scene already has python scripts, and let the PythonEnvironment know the interpreter is being run from the outside when initializing (and maybe deal with all the sys.path / __file__ abuses down there). The PythonEnvironment will create an interpreter if there isn't one (like when launching for a binary executable), or use the one already defined. In this case, PythonEnvironment will use the interpreter that called the script (ex python runSofaPython.py). No new python interpreter nor python thread a created (I've just checked to be sure). > probably have a good fight with the GIL down the road. The current GIL usage in the plugin seems to align correctly with this feature since we ""attach"" the PythonEnvironment to an interpreter instead of initialising a new one. No new threads are created. > how should this feature integrate with existing python scenes? Should it be possible to load scenes from within python scenes?. Yes, it seems to work so far.

Availability,"Hey I hope I got this one right...:. To me the APIVersion component is used to specify the latest version of SOFA we can guarantee compatibility with. Thus when it is already present in an existing scene, the tag is set explicitely in the scene file.; When creating and saving a scene from a modeler for instance though, an APIVersion should be created, and the level should be the level of the version of SOFA the user is running. By default, an APIVersion without a version number was automatically setting the level to 17.12, which to me makes no sense, because we can't guarantee compatibility with 17.12 on a scene that doesn't have an APIVersion set.; Also, somewhere in SceneCheckAPIChange, a 20.06 was hardcoded in a variable `m_selectedApiLevel`. This PR takes the SOFA_VERSION_STR, set by CMake in <sofa/version.h>, and uses this value to replace the default level value in APIVersion, and the selectedAPILevel in SceneCheckAPIChange. ______________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [ ] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [ ] does not generate new warnings.; - [ ] does not generate new unit test failures.; - [ ] does not generate new scene test failures.; - [ ] does not break API compatibility.; - [ ] is more than 1 week old (or has fast-merge label). **Reviewers will merge only if all these checks are true.**",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1473:1201,failure,failures,1201,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1473,2,['failure'],['failures']

Availability,"Hey guys, . so, I checked the PR and I have the following comments:. - The examples of the original PSDE contribution get broken with these commits, so this should be fixed. If you want to provide new examples, that’s also ok! In the case of PSDEExamples/01-basic/ changing the type string in DataEngine.py from 'd' to 'int' already fixes the problem. For PSDEExamples/02-advanced/ I couldn’t find the error immediately. . - Regarding the question of linking and automatic deriving of data-types for Inputs my opinion is similar to Damien’s:. > Sure...what we want to do is to create a new data with the exact same type of the data pointed by a link. So making a clone of an existing data (to get its type) and then initialize its parent would do the trick without needed all the factory and datatypename things. . I also do think that the existing linking mechanism could be complemented by a cloning feature that creates a copy of a BaseData object. Probably just a clone()-function in BaseData. This would avoid the implementation of a “heavy-weight” factory, like Damien said. To add this data to the correct object (the PSDE) it is only necessary to set the owner, I think. Finally, linking is done by using setParent(). In this way the user can program freely in C++ without worrying about whether his newly defined compound type needs to be made available in the factory. - Regarding the question of linking and automatic deriving of data-types for Outputs my ideas are not as concrete, but maybe helpful. For me there exist two cases:. 1) The Output of the PSDE is connected to an Input of a sofa-object that has static datas, e.g., sofa-objects whose code is written in C++. An example for such an object would be MechanicalObject (MO) that always has the same data (position, velocity, force, …). 2) The Output of the PSDE is connected to a scripted sofa-object, like another PSDE or similar. For case 1.:. It could be possible to define a special BaseData with a name but vacant type.

I looked at the way the plugin Image made their ImageData bindings, and I will go for this approach for my datatypes. As for actual byte arrays bindings, that could still be an interesting feature, but what I did wouldn't be the proper way of binding byte arrays: for serialization to python, the size is known thanks to the std::string container, so it is possible to serialize to python the way I did in this pr. But desserialization to c++ would not work out, since there would be no way to know the size of the string to retrieve. If necessary, instead, a new TypeInfo could maybe be added to the interface of AbstractTypeInfo and VirtualTypeInfo, that would provide information about the byte array size, so that desserialization could be implemented.

I made it possible to pass inputs to PythonScriptDataEngines directly through the call to createObject(), which makes it more similar to how components are created in the SceneGraph normally. the example in PSDEAverageEngine.pyscn show the behavior. There are a few downsides in the current implementation though:; - I didn't investigate the effects on error handling (creating input data fields while the field should actually be considered as an ""unused data field name"" for instance..; - I had to hack my way around, probably because I got a bit lost in the SofaPython codebase, trying to figure out how the bindings worked... so the implementation is probably not the cleanest possible.. :/; - The current implementation of the parse() function binding does not pass the BaseObjectDescription object to python, which makes it impossible to retrieve the ""unused datafields"" that we need for the automatic input bindings. Thus I added a ""datalinks"" function, called after the parse() function in python, that takes the key/values pairs of unused attributes passed to createObject, and creates new inputs from them. I chose to create a separate function for that because I didn't dare modifying the behavior of the parse function itself, but it might be worth passing the attributes directly to the python parse method instead, since it is how it's done on the C++ side of things...?.

I haven't had much time to devote to this as of late, but here is some quick feedback so far:. - lots of code need modification (like *lots*), deep down the core and you need lots of patience to recompile everything over and over again,; - it makes little sense to optimize data initialization if you don't optimize links as well since they use a similar initialization mechanism,; - the speedups in my test scenes were disappointing, being largely dominated by other code paths (contact detection and response mostly, since this is the main use case as the graph gets dynamically altered at every time step),; - IIRC there was a data/link notification mechanism on insertion that could cause accidental quadratic complexity when used sequentially (I'll try to fix this one soon),; - beware of CollisionGroup managers that was causing huge slowdowns in my case for no visible reason as there was a single group. The takeaway: this is probably premature optimization at this point.

Availability,"Hi everyone, Marc here :-). I remember I introduced the `init()` and `cleanup()` functions, so I'll add a few words of explanations. Bear with me, it's actually simpler that the length of my response may suggest. > So unless there is a compelling reason to leave it this way (and I would really like to know it). The trick which consists in using static variables to run dynamic initialization code (or cleanup code, for that matter) is an anti-pattern, for a couple of reasons:. * **determinism**: as @matthieu-nesme mentionned, the order of initialization of objects with static storage duration is undefined across translation units. This is the first reason why I introduced the `init()` functions: to make initialization deterministic and reliable. And this is the same reason why it's better to call those functions explicitely, at the _right_ time: the program will work correctly by design, not by coincidence;. * **readability** (or something like that): calling the initialization function ""manually"" makes programs more readable: you can just start from the `main()` function and understand what code is going to run without actually running the code inside a debugger (or reading the entirety of SOFA's source code);. * **choice** (or whatever): with an explicit call to `init()`, an application writer gets to decide both *whether* and *when* to initialize SOFA. ### Now... In the end, I didn't actually bother to search for any single piece of initialization code in SOFA and move it into the appropriate init() function, so the init() functions are pretty light, but the setup is there. Also, the static-dynamic-initialization trick is used all over the place in SOFA, and what happens in the init() functions is ridiculous compared to all the code that probably runs when SOFA is loaded, so here again it is a drop in the ocean, but, I think, a step in the right direction. ### Anyway... > What I don't understand is why the above code snipped does not simply cleanup() the library in ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/168#issuecomment-280028946:744,reliab,reliable,744,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/168#issuecomment-280028946,1,['reliab'],['reliable']

Availability,"Hi mathieu, ; ; This is a good question. . I recently wrote a lot test for sofa component and it appears to me that more than half of my tests cases are in fact verifying that component correctly rise errors or warnings when they are used improperly. Making these tests is very important to avoid un-detected bugs on the error handling code paths and it bring a lot to the general quality of sofa. . About the fact that the ""error as test failure by default"" is covering 99% of our tests... to me this is an indication that our tests are only covering half of the things they should and I'm not sure we should facilitate this behavior. . This is why I came up to making the things explicit in each test because it force the test writer to specify what are his underlying assumption and expectation for each of his tests making things very clear. In addition it put in front of his eyes what he is testing.. and what he is not testing. .

And these savings sums up each time someone is looking at tests failures. . In general I write a test once... but investigate failures several time... so I find it worth the effort of spending a bit more time on writing a good test with narrow message catching because they proved to saves time while investigating failure. . This is a totally different story with the time saving of changing the default mode by changing Sofa_test. It saves time as long as we are hesitating on what should be the default mode but after that it will slow down all failure investigations. . So...

Availability,"Hi!. OptionsGroup in Sofa are currently created in 2 steps:. - in ctor: every option are created, from strings, usually by calling ""setNames()"". A default value is set, usually to 0 by calling setSelectedItem(0); - during parsing of the scene file: user value is taken into account. This is working great, except in one case:; What if my OptionsGroup is supposed to contain a list of values retrieved from another sofa::Data (let's say a vector of strings..)?; - In the Ctor, the string data is not yet initialized, so setNames cannot be called; - in parse() I don't know about the other data so I cannot retrieve the list of values. This also means that when calling setSelectedItem with the value passed in the scene file, I will get an error message as the entry does not exist ; - at init(), my list of values is set, so I can finally call setNames, but I'll lose my default user value from the scene file. To fix this, I modified the OptionsGroup class to store the user value in readFromString(), and added a public method: setSelectedItemToDefault() that calls setSelectedItem() with that stored user value. This solved the issue, but only for OptionsGroup (any sofa::Data that relies on another data for its initialization will have the problem), and it's maybe not in the cleanest way..; Some would argue that listing the values to feed the OptionsGroup with is a task for SofaPython, before calling CreateObject, but I'd like to have this feature even when using XML scene files.

Availability,"Hi!. When building plugins as standalone projects, the SofaFramework package doesn't expose the cmake config options used to build SOFA.; In the SoftRobots plugin (among others), tests are performed to know if SOFA has been built using the required options (such as SOFA_BUILD_METIS, MODULE_SOFASPARSESOLVER, PLUGIN_SOFAPYTHON, SOFA_BUILD_TESTS etc.) and out-of-tree configurations require to re-specify those options, even though they are only defined in the SOFA build. I've modified the SofaFrameworkConfig.cmake.in to expose those options to whoever does a find_package(SofaFramework), although that might not be the smartest way to do it (the list is non exhausive and it would be best if options were added in a smarter way.; I think that modules such as SOFASPARSESOLVER should export the MODULE_SOFASPARSESOLVER themselves for instance, and so should the plugins.; But then there's also a long list of options that would be worth exposing, such as:; - SOFA_BUILD_TESTS; - SOFA_BUILD_METIS; - SOFA_BUILD_TUTORIALS; - SOFA_WITH_DEPRECATED_COMPONENTS; - SOFA_WITH_THREADING; - SOFA_WITH_DEVTOOLS; - SOFA_USE_MASK; - ....

Availability,"Hi, . This PR follows the changes made in BarycentricMapping (i.e use of spatial hashing to find the nearest points instead of an exhaustive search). This new PR:. 1. Handle cases of several grid cells having the same h index. In such case, the distance between two points, that have the same h index, should be computed only if the points are in the same grid cell. This PR add this implementation. Each element is now stored in the hash table with its corresponding grid cell indices. 2. The nearest point, in a shared grid cell, may not be the global nearest point. To improve that, we detect when neighboring cells may contain a better solution, and do the check.

The idea was to get an easy way to add/remove plugin binaries in an installed SOFA **without polluting the bin/ folder** which contains stuff I'm not supposed to touch (or scared to touch). The typical use case is: ; I have SOFA binaries (downloaded from sofa-framework.org or provided by someone) and I have a plugin binaries. How to run the examples of the plugin in runSofa?. Many ways to do that:; 1. launch runSofa, open Plugin Manager, load the plugin, open the scene; 2. edit the scene to add `<AddPluginRepository path=""/path/to/the/plugin""/>` and `<RequiredPlugin name=""the_plugin""/>`, launch the scene in runSofa ; 3. copy/paste the plugin binaries (library or complete folder) in the bin/ folder of SOFA, add `<RequiredPlugin name=""the_plugin""/>` or add the_plugin in bin/plugin_list.conf.default, launch the scene in runSofa ; 4. **[NEW]** copy/paste the plugin binaries (library or complete folder) in the plugins/ folder of SOFA, add `<RequiredPlugin name=""the_plugin""/>` or add the_plugin in bin/plugin_list.conf.default, launch the scene in runSofa . (1) is perfect for a new user but becomes heavy quite soon; (2) is more agile but has limitations for plugins that need to be loaded **before** the scene creation (e.g. for Python env init); (3) solves the limitation of (2) if we use plugin_list.conf but, as I said, putting stuff in bin/ is scary; (4) is what I proposed to separate ""plugins that came with SOFA"" from ""plugins I add myself"".

Availability,"Hi,. I found the usage of data alias more annoying than helpful. ; Currently data alias are used to provide backward compatibility with old scenes. The problem is that by doing so it does not indicate to the user that the data field name has changed and that it should change to fix his scenes.

Though I find it cumbersome to have to manually specify the type of the input/output datafields.; While I have no idea (yet) how to fix this for the component's outputs, I implemented a small method to try to derive the input type from the linked value. We could also add scalar types to this method, to be able to handle passing scalar parameters directly from python.; Also, I think it would make more sense to use directly the output of ; ```; datafield->getValueTypeInfo()->name(); ``` ; instead of an arbitrary __char__ when expliciting the datafield type in the PSDE factory.

This PR rectifies that. @sofa-framework/consortium, I also believe that there should be clear guidelines in SOFA to determine what the ""normal"" way of compiling plugins should be.; I believe that outsourced builds should be the way to go, instead of adding plugins through ; `applications/plugins/CMakeLists.txt`; or cmake's; `EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES`; since it allows people to isolate SOFA a bit more from their work. ______________________________________________________; <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [x] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [x] does not generate new warnings.; - [x] does not generate new unit test failures.; - [x] does not generate new scene test failures.; - [x] does not break API compatibility.; - [x] is more than 1 week old (or has fast-merge label). **Reviewers will merge only if all these checks are true.**",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/395:1011,failure,failures,1011,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/395,2,['failure'],['failures']

Availability,"Hi,. The current dash board does not allows to differentiate tests that fails because they are 'showing' a not yet fixed sofa defect to the one caused by regression (ie tests that were supposed to work but don't anymore). . This is a problem because while introducing new regression failure is a bad thing, introducing new tests that exhibit sofa defect is a positive thing. But they have the same results...turning the dashboard to orange. . I see two consequences:; - when there is test failures because of open-issues we will detect much less easily the regressions tests (that are 'more' important !) ; - people will prevent themselves to push open-issues test to avoid to turn the dash board to a not green status (because they are ashamed...or because they prefer to preserve the readability of the dash board to detect regression). So would it be possible to change that so that each tests with a pattern (lke ""OpenIssue"" in their name are counted separately ?. This would allow to reports two numbers instead of one eg:; regression test failure : 0 ; open issues tests failure: 123 ; And also to let the dashboard green for open issues tests failure. .

Availability,"Hi,; ; Here's my fix for issue #1534. The problem was the use of `beginEdit()`, `endEdit()`... I'm not sure what was happening exactly,; but it looked like it was triggering extra callback... - I've replaced all `beginEdit()` with `getWriteOnlyAccessor()` and removed the `endEdit()` when there was any. I'm pretty sure `MeshGmshLoader` is also broken. I was about to fix it, but I came across another problem.; `MeshGmshLoader` uses calls to `addTriangle(...)`, `addEdge(...)`, `addQuad(...)`, etc., which are implemented in `MeshLoader`.; For the moment, `addTriangle` is the only one which has been duplicated to work with data returned by `getWriteOnlyAccessor()`.; I think we all agree that duplication of code should be avoided. I'm not sure what we should do here. Should we generalize the use of `getWriteOnlyAccessor()` in all loaders, and change all `addEdge(...)`, `addQuad(...)`, etc., signature once and for all (no duplication)?; Or should it be fine to use `beginEdit()`, and my fix doesn't solve the real problem? .

Availability,"I am currently running a convergence analysis using python scenes. Since the convergence analysis loads several settings from a .json file, it would be good to have a possibility to forward the filename of the file to the python scene via the command line. To my knowledge, this is not possible at the moment, please correct me if I am wrong and explain me your solution. My first work around was to load from the same file (I call it outputJson, see the function definition below). However, this becomes cumbersome, when the code is parallelized, since several threads would like to load from that same file. My approach for the parallelization is to write the filename (which is now adapted to every scene) first into the .scn using PHP and then to load it from the python scene. ; That means, in the .scn file we have:; `<?php echo '<PythonScriptController classname=""convergenceBeam_Template"" filename=""convergenceBeam_TemplatePython.py"" listening=""1"" name=""convergenceBeam_Template"" variables=""'.$argv[1].'"" />'; ?>`; which called from the convergence python script and deleted later; ```; os.system(""php convergenceBeam_TemplatePython.scn ""+sofaOutput+"".pyscndata > ""+curTime+"".scn""); ... call the scene; os.system(""rm ""+curTime+"".scn""); ```; In the .py file we load the data using; `self.defineDataFromJson(self.findData(""variables"").value[0][0])`; where; ```; def defineDataFromJson(self,jsonFilename=""outputJson"") :; f = open(jsonFilename,'r'); self.data = json.load(f); f.close(); def getValueOfData(self,keyOfData) :; if keyOfData in self.data.keys():; return self.data[keyOfData]; printStack(); sys.exit(""\nERROR\n the key ""+keyOfData+"" is not defined!\nERROR\n""); ```. Both of the solutions I consider as hacks, the first as it can not run in parallel and the second as the scene does not work without running php on the side, thus it does not work with one command line.

Availability,"I am unsure this PR is correct, so it really needs a green light from others before merge. When trying to call `std::exit` in some plugin, I had a segfault in cleanup code similar to this one:. ```c++; // Detect missing cleanup() call.; static const struct CleanupCheck; {; CleanupCheck() {; }; ; ~CleanupCheck() {; if (core::isInitialized() && !core::isCleanedUp()); helper::printLibraryNotCleanedUpWarning(""SofaCore"", ""sofa::core::cleanup()""); // segfault; }; } check;; ```. In fact, most `init.cpp` files in SOFA have code similar to this one. In my case, `MessageDispatcher::LoggerStream::~LoggerStream` caused a call to `MessageDispatcher::process` which would then cause a segfault. What I don't understand is *why* the above code snipped does not simply `cleanup()` the library in the destructor, since the latter is being called while the library unloads and this is the last chance to actually clean things up, instead of (trying to) emit a warning while the whole program is being terminated. So unless there is a compelling reason to leave it this way (and I would really like to know it), I suggest the above to be changed to:. ```c++; static const struct CleanupCheck; {; CleanupCheck() {; init();; }; ; ~CleanupCheck() {; cleanup();; // leaving the warning if for some reason cleanup failed; if (core::isInitialized() && !core::isCleanedUp()); helper::printLibraryNotCleanedUpWarning(""SofaCore"", ""sofa::core::cleanup()"");; }; } check;; ```. so that the library automatically `init()` and `cleanup()` upon `dlopen`/`exit`. <!--- Please leave this at the end of your message -->; This PR: ; - [ ] builds with SUCCESS for all platforms on the CI.; - [ ] does not generate new warnings nor unit test failures.; - [ ] does not break existing scenes.; - [ ] does not break API compatibility.; - [ ] has been reviewed and agreed to be transitional.; - [ ] is more than 1 week old.; **Reviewers will merge only if all this checks are true.**",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/168:1710,failure,failures,1710,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/168,1,['failure'],['failures']
Availability,"I believe whatever the approach taken it should allow to keep things pretty clear between ; - unit tests, ie tests that hardly depend on initializing a scene. In these tests you hardly need a concrete instance of node or simulation. If you need this it may be nice to have a class to derive from which does it for you, but then again it should stay optional, because you should really think again about how you designed your component if you need a full fledged simulation to actually make some basic testing on your component. ; No matter what, these tests should be executed at each build (even for devs) and must pass. Failing in this kind of tests must be equal to a compilation error.; In that respect there is something that I am reluctant to allow for this type of tests is a lose coupling approach where you instantiate components using keys from the object factory. You may end up writing tests that in fact do not compile from a scratch build because this allows you to not take care about the dependencies between the libs. That is to say a test may instantiate a component that is not available yet, because it belongs to a library which is deeper in the build dependency tree at the time the unit test is built and executed during the compilation. - Functional tests, that require a working scene with probably more components than the one actually tested. These tests can be longer and therefore should not be mandatory during the compilation. ; They will be run only in ci machines, but can be also easily executed by any developers on its machine mostly to debug what is the nature of a new regression in these kind of tests. ; From our experience at InSimo these kinds of tests regress quite often during the development of a new feature, because you make some optimisation in the code, and you get some epsilon difference, or because you change the approach entirely and the scene is no longer relevant for you and should be changed.

Availability,"I chose the library https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib because it allows also to create a server (but not used in this PR). In any case, whatever the library we choose, we must use openSSL (we request a https). This is the main concern about this PR. In terms of installation, I think Ubuntu and macOS are straightforward because there are packages. But Windows is bit more tricky. The pre-built binaries are not available on the openSSL website. I found them here: https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html. After installation, I had to define `OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR`, and add the `bin` folder to my path. In this PR, the newly introduced module is linked only in Sofa.GUI.Qt and the version checker is called at init (for test). A later contribution will use the introduced function to show the latest version in the GUI. Output example:; ```; [INFO] [VersionChecker] You are using the latest version (24.06.99). {272.525 ms}; ```. ______________________________________________________.

Availability,"I dont think the fix is good ; the ""toMatrix()"" is available for Mat3x3 but not for Mat4x4 (there was a ` toMatrix` for Mat4x4 but it was deleted and replace with `toHomogenousMatrix()` ).; This RigidCoord::toMatrix() is templated on the Mat type actually, and is really ill-formed (no assert on the size of the given matrix, etc).; I think the solution is to either:; - test if the matrix is 3x3 or 4x4 (and failed to compile with a message with a static assert) and calling the respective ` toMatrix()` or ` toHomogenousMatrix ()` ; - or remove the template, force it to Mat3x3 and create an other `toHomogenousMatrix` in RigidCoord.

Availability,"I have several objections with this PR. ; - the mechanism relies on a specific symbol lookup. So in order to make a plugin auto-loadable, you need to recompile the plugin which design wise is not so great. ; - It also has the major downside of having to load the library to know if the plugin is auto-loadable, which in the end results in having to load all the available plugins. Loading a library in the process memory will have several side effects which are difficult to anticipate before hand. The major one is the evaluation of all the global variables, which will result in populating the `ObjectFactory` with all the components that this library contains. I would suggest something different for this kind of having a list of default plugins that are loaded directly with your application ( here `runSofa` ). - derive a sort of sofa plugin manifest file, which can be generated as a post-build step. This should be an easy to parse file which could contain the various informations exposed by the `getModuleName()`, `getModuleVersion()`... without having to load the library in the process memory. This manifest file must be stored in an easy to find location in your build tree, an be installed properly ( they need also to be bundled when you deploy your application ). That means they should be located with a similar relative path with respect to the application ( `runSofa` ) when in the build tree or in the install tree. There should be a proposal about that to define : ; - the manifest file type ( ie how are we going to parse it ? json xml text ? ); - the manifest file content itself. - any application could then define the list of predefined plugin it wants to load using a simple configuration file. A default configuration can be provided, but it could be easily overriden. With this mechanism, no recompilation is required when you want to change the list of default plugins, you just change the config file.

Availability,I noticed several flaw (or hard to understand) with the way mass and totalMass interact in DiagonalMass compared to what is done in UniformMass. . eg: ; - totalMass is set as readOnly in DiagonalMass while it is not in UniformMass; - despite totalMass is readOnly the value can still be changed in the scene file (so I wonder that the readOnly flag should be renamed to something that reflect what is it used for :)); - despite totalMass is readOnly there is no error message indicating to the user that the value he gave in his scene is simply dropped and that he should not use this flag. ; - the totalMass parameter is re-computed in the un-specialized implementation of the reinit function... but the specialization for rigid/vec and so on are not forwarding to this un-specialized implementation but the to implementation in-herited from the parent. (Is this really what we want ? This look a very weird design to me and I suspect problems on this forwarding to the parent.). ; - f_mass data (mass) field also seems to be a readOnly component (it seems deduced from massDensity and volume of the elements) but it is not tagged in the same way as totalMass.

I chose to rely on Qt because otherwise it requires a new lib for the http request, and Qt is already here. But having Qt is not enough. I have an error related to ssl (similar error to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53805704/tls-initialization-failed-on-get-request). It requires additional components in the Qt installation. I did not try it myself because it changes the installation process of SOFA. So before going further, we need to conclude that this feature is desirable (and is not a gadget). If it is, we can decide to rely on Qt and its additional component, or to go with a simpler C++ library (https://github.com/JosephP91/curlcpp for example).

Availability,"I switched to the dark side, running emacs as my IDE :smiling_imp:, and I was testing it on SOFA's codebase. (If you like coding & navigating through SOFA's codebase without having QtCreator transforming your laptop into an airplane, you should try it, it's great!) ; Anyway, I'd like to suggest adding some stuff to the .gitignore file:. * emacs auto-generates autosave files that have the following formats: `#*` and `~*` ; * When running emacs as an IDE, an emacs package called `projectile` creates a file called `.dir-locals.el`, containing project configuration, compilation, and running instructions for emacs in the project's root folder.; * Finally, Emacs uses `clangd` or `ccls` as its language servers. these programs store their index (LSP data for the project's codebase) in `.cache/` and `.ccls-cache/` respectively. clangd & ccls both require cmake to generate a `compile_commands.json` file, which we also don't want to be committed in the git repository. I also noticed that SOFA doesn't have a `.clang-format` file. A clang-format file gives great hints to contributors, regarding the formating guidelines for SOFA.

Indeed, those two functions are very similar as they are related to the derivative of the force. This PR is a proof of concept that is not ready to be merged. Indeed, I noticed losses of performances. And I also would like to make sure with the CI that everything works perfectly.

FreeMotion runs in 7.7 ms and CollisionDetection in 16.36 ms. If these two steps runs in parallel, we expect a gain of 7.7 ms (the minimum between 7.7 and 16.36).; On my computer, with the multi-threaded scene, FreeMotion+CollisionDetection runs in 16.93 ms in average. It is a gain of 7.99 ms (=24.92-16.93), which is about what we expected.; It validates the implementation of the parallelization of the collision detection and the free motion steps in the FreeMotionAnimationLoop. ![cubes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10572752/115711281-9f0e1980-a373-11eb-9a69-aaece62f6cb9.gif). ______________________________________________________.

Availability,"In `applyDJT`, the following product is computed:. $$; b \mathrel{{+}{=}} h^2 \frac{\partial \mathbf{J}}{\partial x_{\text{out}}} f_{\text{out}} v_\text{in}; $$. with `b` being the right side of the main equation, `h` the time step size ($h^2$ is the `kFactor`), `x` the position, `v` the velocity and `f` the force. Subscript `in` refers to the parent of the mapping, and `out` to the child. $J$ is the jacobian matrix of the mapping. The method in `SquareMapping` had two ways to compute this product:. 1) Using K which has been computed previsously. And multiply it by $v_\text{in}$; 2) Using $f_{\text{out}}$ and $v_\text{in}$ only, without using a cached matrix. Only the first method was tested in unit tests. I forced the second method in a unit test by introducing a Data `useGeometricStiffnessMatrix`. It could be observed that the second method failed. It needed a fix.

Availability,"In a mapped state, force fields and masses contribute to the global system matrix via a projection provided by mappings. The term $m M+ k K$ is assembled locally (association with the mapped state), and then the product $J^T (m M+ k K) J$.; However, in most cases, $M$ is constant. In addition, in some cases $J$ is also constant. If we fulfill the conditions so that both $M$ and $J$ are constants, we can extract the product $J^T M J$ and pre-compute it once at the beginning of the simulation. This is what this PR does. In addition to the pre-computation, there is a cache invalidation mechanism on masses to track when $M$ is subject to changes. For example, changes in the mass parameter by the user. This pre-computation is the most efficient when there is a difference of sparsity between $M$ and $K$. And this is the case when hyper-reduction is involved. $K$ is super sparse (only a few elements are considered), while $M$ gets contributions from all the nodes of the detailed mesh.

Availability,"In issue #746 is reported a bug when trying trying to simulate; scenes while the underlying topology is containing empty data set. I narrowed the problem to be in LocalMinDistance::computeIntersection.; In this function we access the trianglesAroundVertex from a MeshTopology. with code like that:; ```cpp; if (m_edgesInTetrahedron.empty() || i > m_edgesInTetrahedron.size()-1); createEdgesInTetrahedronArray();; return m_edgesInTetrahedron[i];; ```. While if there is not ""nothing"" to create because there is no edges/triangles; it access in there is still a return of m_edgesInTetrahedron[i] with indice = 0. To avoid that I change the code for:; ```cpp; const MeshTopology::EdgesInTetrahedron& MeshTopology::getEdgesInTetrahedron(TetraID i); {; if (m_edgesInTetrahedron.empty() || i > m_edgesInTetrahedron.size()-1); createEdgesInTetrahedronArray();. if (i < m_edgesInTetrahedron.size()); return m_edgesInTetrahedron[i];. return InvalidEdgesInTetrahedron;; }; ```.

Availability,"In the `getValuePtr` methods, a buffer on vector data is obtained by actually returning a reference to the vector first element. However the case where the method is called on an empty (but valid) vector is not handled. This may lead to an execution error, for instance when using SofaPython3 to assign values to a component's Data dynamically. This specific scenario is the object of a second PR in SofaPython3 [(link to the PR)](https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3/pull/318). To change this, we propose to use the `std::vector.data()` method, which handles the case when the vector is actually empty (however returning a pointer that may or may not be null).

Availability,"In this PR, `map_ptr_stable_compare` is preferred over `unordered_map`, as it allows reproducible contact response. However, `unordered_map` is still a lot faster. #2047 leads to a crash in `examples/Components/collision/RayTraceCollision.scn`. I suspect the cause of this crash existed before #2047, and that #2047 revealed the crash by processing the contacts in a non-deterministic order. With the non-deterministic order, I can see that the crash does not happen always at the same current time step. It even happened that there was no crash. Currently, I am not able to fix the crash. But I will continue investigating. As a workaround I restore the stable map to have deterministic contacts. IMO, it hides the cause of the crash. In the end, I think the stable map should be proposed to the user (as a parameter?) by default.

Availability,"In this PR:. - Added static class member `Visitor::runVisitorTask`; - Used `Visitor::runVisitorTask` in BaseMechanicalVisitor to replace all the boilerplate code; - Simplify the logic in `BaseMechanicalVisitor::processNodeTopDown` even though I have some concerns; - `Visitor::for_each` is now static; - `Visitor::for_each` accepts an optional string parameter giving the type of visitor ""fwd"" or ""bwd""; - `Visitor::for_each_r` is removed in favour of an overload of `Visitor::for_each`; - SOFA_VERBOSE_TRAVERSAL surrounds the calls of `debug_write_state_before` and `debug_write_state_after`, instead of the functions themselves. Doing that, it allows to actually compile the debug content of both function. And I noticed that they had compilation errors (we could not detect it as SOFA_VERBOSE_TRAVERSAL is never defined). My concerns:. 1. I wanted to use `Visitor::runVisitorTask` in other visitors than BaseMechanicalVisitor. But the logic is not the same. BaseMechanialVisitor is the only visitor checking the tags. Should we always check the tags? Also, the debug boilerplate code is not consistent over all the visitors.; 2. `Visitor::for_each` returns only the result of the last call in the loop. In another loop on the solvers at the beginning of `BaseMechanicalVisitor::processNodeTopDown`, we check the intermediate values. It is not consistent. I suspect that `Visitor::for_each` must also check intermediate values.; 3. In `BaseMechanicalVisitor::processNodeTopDown`, between the process of `mechanicalMapping` and `mechanicalState`, we don't check if `res == RESULT_PRUNE`. It means we do the process of `mechanicalState` even if the process of `mechanicalMapping` returned `RESULT_PRUNE`. It's not consistent with the rest of the code.; 4.

Availability,"Introduction; =========; This PR refactor the class reflection feature. . In this PR didn't removed functionalities but i reorganized, rename and refactor them. . To ease the transition, I have let the old function available with a deprecated message trying at best to preserve feature. When the transitional layer will be removed (in a few month so) you may encounter compilation failure because of function removing, so it is highly suggested to quickly update your code. A dedicated section at the end of this document gives you hints on how to update you code. . Changes:. Move name decoding apsect in a separated file called NameDecoder.h; -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------; Currently name processing is done in Base. This is generating an not needed noise ; for developper. So I moved all that name's related code into a separated file NameDecoder.h. ; So to get typeName, className, shortName, etc...you can now do:; ```cpp; NameDecoder::getTemplateName<MyObject>();; ``` ; The mecanism to implement custom name or template was too complex than what it should requiring to implement several function (the virtual one and the static one). So I propose here a different implementation where, to customize the template or className you just needs to implement the CustomClassName()/CustomTemplateName() static function in your class ...and everthing will work out of the box. For curious people have look at the SFINAE used to implement that in NameDecoder. The NameDecoder class is now used by the BaseClass to decode names. Remove duplicated custom template name; -------------------------------------------------------; A complete mecanisme is now implemented in the NameDecoder & BaseClass to provide default templateName for sofa object. The underlying idea was to remove the needs to those kind of code ; ```cpp; MyClass : public BaseObject; virtual std::string getTemplateName() const { return ""CustomName""; } ; static std::string t",MatchSource.ISSUE,sofa-framework,sofa,v24.06.00,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1283:215,avail,available,215,https://www.sofa-framework.org,https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa/pull/1283,2,"['avail', 'failure']","['available', 'failure']"
Availability,"Investigation from the problem I got with regression, which was that the sofa::component::init(); In GCC, it was crashing, whereas on clang/msvc it was not. After debugging, it appears that there was a infinite loop when calling all the init() of the submodules.; E.g Sofa.Component calls sofa::component::collision::init() which calls initExternalModule of Sofa.Component.Collision. ; But with gcc, it was not calling initExternalModule() of Sofa.Component.Collision but the one of Sofa.Component. and then tries to call again init() etc. I suspect problems with demangling the function name in the binary (extern ""C"") and stuff like that, but I did not go further.; The solution anyway is to put the call of the initialization in init() and not in initExternalModule() (and not vice versa). ______________________________________________________.
