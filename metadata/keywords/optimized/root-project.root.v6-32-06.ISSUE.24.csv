Deployability,"Thanks Philippe. After further consideration, i think you're right. I had indeed been concerned about a possible deadlock, but i had thought; that it was probably ok because a similar change was working fine; in production. But (a), i had forgotten about the dlopen lock and (b),; they weren't exactly the same change. As i alluded to above, we didn't; want to have a custom patch to ROOT, so for production we address this; race by wrapping dlopen. But in that case, the core lock is acquired; _before_ the call to dlopen, not after. So, what is to be done?. There is probably only one code path in ATLAS that was giving us problems.; The Gaudi plugin manager was being used to load one of the POOL libraries; that happened to include ROOT dictionary information. I could; acquire the ROOT core lock around this (and one or two other places; where i known that Gaudi components may be loaded after event processing; starts). However, there are many other places where shared libraries; could potentially be loaded. While those probably don't matter...; the original bug here was quite opaque, taking several months; to completely track down. So i'm loathe to leave open any possibility; that it could bite us again. We could add locking within TClassTable. This is perhaps an attractive; way forward, as it should make it much easier to ensure that usages; of TClassTable are correct. A drawback is that is hard to then ensure; that we don't have something else that is also supposed to be protected; by the core mutex. Nevertheless, i could try to prepare a change; to do this if it sounds good. However, that's not the end of the problems. If this analysis is correct, then we _already_ have potential deadlock; problems, as there is nothing to prevent the initialization code of a; shared library (which can be arbitrary used code) from calling into ROOT; in a way that would acquire the core mutex. So code which would look; innocent to the user would have a chance of deadlocking.; I'm not sure ",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071:375,patch,patch,375,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11263#issuecomment-1231069071,1,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,Thanks for the PR. `ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY` seems to be a function and it has lexical scoping rules so I do not understand why resetting the `definitions` variable make things work. Why do we need another switch for `REFLEX_GENERATE_DICTIONARY`? We should be able to deduce the include paths from the target configurations. Passing different include paths using `USES` would mean that your dictionary has a different set of header files (compiled in a different way) than the library the dictionary is compiled in. That's quite dangerous as it can bring hard to diagnose inconsistencies. The direction ROOT has taken in the past is that it encourages single cmake call to produce library and its dictionaries. This is what `ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` is. Maybe we should have something similar for reflex or even better (add a flag for ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PACKAGE` which calls `genreflex` instead of `rootcling`.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5019#issuecomment-587478295:310,configurat,configurations,310,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5019#issuecomment-587478295,1,['configurat'],['configurations']

Deployability,"The ROOT binaries don't come with `fft3` enabled because of licensing incompatibilities (GPL). However, it is not necessary to recompile all of ROOT to get the `fftw3` functionality.

Therefore, it would be very convenient for users if `math/fftw` could be built standalone, such that an existing ROOT installation can pick up these plugins. This was tested by building ROOT without `fftw3`, then also building and installing `math/fftw` standalone. I was running the RooFit convolution unit tests before and after installing `math/fftw` standalone.

Deployability,"The `RPyROOTApplication` is a `TApplication` that sets up the nuts and bolts for interactive ROOT use from Python, closely following `TRint`. This PR adds the basic behaviour for `TApplication` implemented in C++, i.e. parsing of arguments, configuration of some ROOT globals and setup of an error message handler that is able to translate ROOT warnings into Python warnings. The custom parsing of arguments can be disabled by the user by specifying a configuration option after importing ROOT:; ```python; import ROOT; ROOT.PyConfig.IgnoreCommandLineOptions = True; ```. Moreover, this PR also brings in some logic that is located in `ROOT.py` in the current PyROOT. Such logic makes it possible to use ROOT interactive graphics from Python. The graphics are activated only if the batch mode is off, and they are configured by means of hooks: no thread is explicitly created to process the GUI events as before.

This step can be disabled by passing `-DGCOVR=0` to `ctest`. It is recommended to use a debug build to generate the coverage analysis.

Deployability,"The ctor of `GSLMCIntegrator` creates a `GSLRngWrapper` instance on the heap and calls its `Allocate()` member function which in turn allocates memory for a GSL random number generator via `gsl_rng_alloc()`. When the `GSLMCIntegrator` instance goes out of scope, its dtor is invoked which deletes the `GSLRngWrapper` pointer and thus invokes its dtor as well. However, `~GSLRngWrapper()` frees the allocated memory only if `fOwn` pointer is set to true, which is only set so in the assignment operator, but not in the `Allocate()` member function. Therefore, the `GSLMCIntegrator` class is leaking memory. This poses a problem, when doing a large number of integrations inside a for loop. The leak was discovered by running valgrind and inspecting the code. Minimal example:; ```cpp; #include <Math/GSLMCIntegrator.h> // ROOT::Math::GSLMCIntegrator. /* built with:. g++ -ggdb3 -Og `root-config --cflags` mcintegrator.cpp -o mcintegrator \; `root-config --libs` -lMathMore. */. int; main(); {; for(unsigned i = 0; i < 20000; ++i); {; ROOT::Math::GSLMCIntegrator vegas(""vegas"", 0., 1.e-1, 10);; }; return 0;; }; ```.

Deployability,"The fact that `wait_for_workers` waits forever looks to me like the Dask job is never actually started. You should double check that a simple Dask application with the same config but doing something else unrelated to RDF is working. Let's see, something like this should suffice (inspired by the dask [docs](https://examples.dask.org/delayed.html) and your reproducer):; ```python; import time; import random. from dask import delayed; from dask.distributed import Client; from dask_jobqueue import HTCondorCluster. cluster = HTCondorCluster(cores=1, processes=1, memory=""1GB"", disk=""0.1GB"", job_extra={""jobflavour"": ""espresso""}); cluster.scale(jobs=1); client = Client(cluster). # Try with and without this; client.wait_for_workers(1). def inc(x):; time.sleep(random.random()); return x + 1. def dec(x):; time.sleep(random.random()); return x - 1. def add(x, y):; time.sleep(random.random()); return x + y. inc = delayed(inc); dec = delayed(dec); add = delayed(add). x = inc(1); y = dec(2); z = add(x, y). print(f""Result is: {z.compute()}""); ```. Coming back to RDF, the `npartitions` parameter corresponds to how many distributed tasks will be sent to the Dask scheduler. Supposing you know something about how many resources you have or the layout of your ROOT dataset, you could set this manually in the RDataFrame constructor like; ```python; df = RDataFrame(""treename"",""filename.root"",daskclient=client,npartitions=NPARTITIONS); ``` ; A good parallelisation can often be obtained when the number of partitions is roughly 3x the amount of cores you can use.; UPDATE:. > in particular I'm interested in using Dask's adaptive worker management, so that the exact number of submitted jobs is not fixed a priori but automatically adapts to the workload... Sounds good, then the `npartitions` parameter could be adjusted based on how many TTree clusters you have in your dataset.

Deployability,"The idea for this change comes from my own experiments with upgrading LLVM during my time as student worker (and I can't reliably tell if I wrote the code during paid hours or in my free time, hence the funny list of authorships).

Deployability,"The idea is to catch branch names, which will lead to problems when using the tree with `Draw` or `MakeClass`.; This can either be the member variables (branch names and `b_`branch names) which have to keep the generated code compilable (and ensure it does what it is expected to do). And the variable names should not lead to confusion with formula evaluation in Draw (e.g. branch names which are pure numbers). The tests suggested here are:; - test if branch name is a valid c++ variable name (w/o testing keywords).; - test if branch name begins with ""b_"" (potential problem with MakeClass). on top of that, I also have a [black list](https://github.com/pseyfert/tmva-branch-adder/blob/master/src/blacklist.cpp) of unfortunate branch names: methods of TTrees, which would clash in MakeClass, c++ keywords, variable types, and things TTree::Draw can parse (though I don't see how `TTree::Draw(""cos(x)"")` would clash with `TTree::Draw(""cos"")` if there is a variable named `cos`. Because the function `cos` wouldn't work without argument, and the variable `cos` wouldn't work with argument). I only warn here and don't abort the branch initialisation, not to break third party code (variables with `.` are probably common [e.g. dynamically generated from float](http://lhcb-release-area.web.cern.ch/LHCb-release-area/DOC/davinci/latest_doxygen/d9/d80/_tuple_tool_cone_isolation_8cpp_source.html#l00204) ).

Deployability,"The idea of the RooGenProdProj is that we divide two integral objects; each created with this makeIntgral() function to get the normalized; integral of a product. Therefore, we don't need to normalize the; numerater and denominator integrals themselves. Doing the normalization; would be expensive and it would cancel out anyway. However, if we don't; specify an explicit normalization integral in createIntegral(), the; last-used normalization set might be used to normalize the pdf,; resulting in redundant computations. For this reason, the normalization set of the integrated pdfs is fixed; to an empty set in this case. Note that in RooFit, a nullptr; normalization set and an empty normalization set is not equivalent. The; former implies taking the last-used normalization set, and the latter; means explicitly no normalization. This fixes the performance regression reported in https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11814, and a new unit; test is implemented to make sure no new numeric integrals pop up in the; reproducer code to that issue. Unfortunately, this change means that there will be again warnings about; missing `RooAddPdf` normalization sets, but this is not a regression; because these warnings only got fixed in the 6.28 development cycle in; https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/290b478710a90351bd7b15130a7a81e01b461940.

Deployability,"The idea was to have an executable that is linked statically against ROOT and other dependencies so that it can be used as the legacy version of a certain software package which is being retired in favour of new software. For example in order to run it using a gitlab runner for various cross-checks without the need to install root from source (multiple times even, for every testing stage) or ship it together with huge CentOS images. For the gitlab this just seems to be almost unfeasible, even with existing root docker containers from the docker hub. I understand that if ROOT was never meant to be used in this way, there just won't be resources to dedicate to this. So I will probably have to find a way to access such an exectuable from somewhere else while running those tests or run them offline.

Deployability,"The main change in this PR is that the `CustomColumn` term is replaced by the clearer, shorter `Define` term. This require quite a few changes all over RDataFrame internals. Motivation for the change can be found below, copy-pasted from the commit message. This will make future backports a bit of a pain, but I think it's worth doing it now, for the following reasons:; * we are at a historical low of RDF-related open bugs -> less backports are expected in the future; * recent large refactorings in RAction.hxx (#6220) and in the column reader logic (#6170) already make backports much less likely to apply cleanly to release branches, so if there is a less bad time to do this, it's probably now; * expected upcoming refactorings necessary to support bulk entry processing will put another nail in the coffin of backportable bug-fixes; * I think we can all agree that RCustomColumn is a terribly opaque name for something that at this point we all know as a ""Define"", and in a few years I'd rather not have doctoral students complain about how my class names are completely arbitrary and unnecessarily hard to understand . The original commit message:. Until recently, RCustomColumns could correspond to data-source columns; or defined columns. Due to recent refactorings, RCustomColumns are now; back to serving only their original purpose: representing Define nodes; in the computation graph.; RCustomColumn is a very opaque name, and it crops up when debugging,; reading code and looking at performance profilings. The new name,; RDefine, clearly describes what the class is supposed to do and it is in; line with RDF's naming convention (we already have RFilter).

Deployability,"The operations done by the LookupHelper are costly in both memory and; performance. Almost every operation requires memory allocation and parsing; of often non-trivial C++ code. Unfortunately, the LookupHelper is used very intensively by rootcling and; ROOT. The callers usually do not use any caching mechanisms and redo the; expensive operations over and over even though the answer is known to be; the same as before. For instance, building the dictionary of shows:. ```; MathCore:; Cached entries: 217; Total parse requests: 54051; Cache hits: 53834; TreePlayer:; Cached entries: 183; Total parse requests: 57697; Cache hits: 57514; ```. This patch introduces the first set of caching functionality. In; particular, each LookupHelper::find* function allocates a memory buffer; which is then stored in the clang::SourceManager. We hash the buffer; content and keep a mapping between a hash and FileID and next time we; encounter the same content we do not allocate a new FileID but reuse the; old one. We see decrease in memory footprint by 7% for non-cxxmodules ROOT. For cxxmodules we see significant reduction of the pcm sizes (by half); which translates into rss improvements:. ```; master before:; cpu time = 0.291462 seconds; sys time = 0.064409 seconds; res memory = 345.816 Mbytes; vir memory = 573.508 Mbytes; master after:; cpu time = 0.235828 seconds; sys time = 0.098327 seconds; res memory = 260.012 Mbytes; vir memory = 377.945 Mbytes; ```.

Ideally, `MnApplication` should hold a smart pointer to `ModularFunctionMinimizer`, which is initialized with a concrete instance by each derived class. The method `Minimizer()` wouldn't be virtual and overloaded in each derived class. There could just be two normal methods in `MnApplication` for const and non-const access to the internal smart pointer. The `MnApplication` would get a modified constructor that accepts the raw pointer of `ModularFunctionMinimizer` created in each derived class.

Deployability,"The previous implementation required TGeoTessellated shapes to be read attached to a TGeoManager. This removes the limitation, and allows also reading geometry files containing shapes converted to VecGeom corresponding solids. # This Pull request:. ## Changes or fixes:; * Restructured the `TGeoFacet` helper class, eliminating referencing vertices stored in the associated `TGeoTessellated` object, since this required calling a specific method `TGeoTessellated::AfterStreamer` to fix all the facet objects. The new version moves all vertex operations from TGeoFacet to the TGeoTessellated class, making the latter readable from a root file even if not connected to a `TGeoManager`; * Added persistency to the class `TGeoVGShape` which interfaces `TGeoShape` to `vecgeom::VPlacedVolume`. This allows to write/read geometry files after being converted to VecGeom. Upon reading, a check is made that the current root version was also compiled with VecGeom support, and if this is not the case a `Fatal` exception is fired. ## Checklist:. - [x] tested changes locally; - [ ] updated the docs (if necessary).

Deployability,"The problem is that LLVM ships with zlib. Since recently, we meld the header files of the PCH in a zip in it (fa9a2eee8376a0d4c4393b8f94fa3f841455c32d). Clang uses zlib [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/interpreter/llvm/src/tools/clang/lib/Serialization/ASTReader.cpp#L1302) and [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/interpreter/llvm/src/tools/clang/lib/Serialization/ASTWriter.cpp#L2052) when building the PCH in `-fmodules-embed-all-files` mode. IIUC, the issue is the way the JIT resolves symbols. Currently, cling's JIT gives a preference to the local content to itself, i.e. resolves symbols from libCling.so first. This would mean that even if we link another version of zlib to libCore, cling will still find the symbols from llvm's library. And that's by design, because we want to resolve the embedded in ROOT LLVM symbols first. Otherwise cling will start picking up random LLVM symbols introducing a lot of compatibility and versioning issues. I'd propose we try to solve this in two steps. First we should try disabling LLVM's zlib from `interpreter/CMakeLists.txt` instead of the current patch. I suspect that LLVM will be able to find and use the system's zlib (in that case we should make sure LLVM links to the version of zlib we expect: @oshadura has a nice test case for it).

It is a common occurrence in the root code to use initialization classes that perform configuration in its constructor, and then have a static instance of this class declared in a library so that this initialization happens automatically when the library is loaded. This initialization often depends on the various directory paths. Since the initialization of the static instances in the libraries an application links to happens before the main program starts, the behaviour of these initialization routines can not be modified by command line options, since these options are parsed by the main program.

There was the necessity to start testing a certain subset of TMVA, which was never tested before (see https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15197); 2. The packages were added to `requirements.txt` so that the docker images built for Linux runners of the new CI infrastructure could pick them up (the images are built nightly and they install in the virtual environment of the docker container all the packages in `requirements.txt` available in `master` at the time of building the image).; 3. Jenkins has been disabled since more than a week now so these packages were not manually installed on the Linux nodes of the old Jenkins instance.

Deployability,"There are three ways to get the code of latest-stable:; a) git clone as suggested by https://root.cern/install/: 1.4GiB; b) git clone with --depth=20: 673MiB; c) unpacking the zip file download from github: 477MiB. I think for 99% of the users, option a offers no benefits over option b. If you are testing or writing feature branches, it might not be worth figuring out how to fetch only the relevant parts (--shallow-exclude?). And if you were writing a paper on the history of ROOT, you will want the full version history. . Option c has some serious downsides as well. github just calls the directory root-latest-stable, which is a lot less specific than what you would get from a versioned tarball. (Apparently, the version is in build/version_number). Furthermore, lack of a git repository is bad for anyone who might change stuff locally -- reunpacking the zip file and running diff -r is a lot less fun than using git diff. . I would thus argue that option b is the way to go by default: it reduces the space requirements by some 53% while also retaining the ability to make changes and easily contribute them, should the need arise. . Of course, many users will not care about space requirements as any --human-readable output not containing by the Si prefix P is considered small fries anyhow.

Deployability,"This PR addresses the code quality issues identified by @Axel-Naumann and @lmoneta . One of the points raised can be tackled in multiple ways. The purpose of publishing this PR now with the **[Do Not Merge]** tag is to facilitate discussion (see last section). I can then apply what we agree upon, update the PR and Lorenzo can merge. . ## Solved; The following issues have been addressed (1 commit per issue more or less): . * Compilation warnings are solved.; * Assumptions about the size of passed matrices are asserted where appropriate.; * Flow of control in unit tests is simplified by exiting early with an error code when a test fails.; * Floating point arithmetic issue solved when checking whether a float is actually an int. ## Discussion. One of the comments has to do with the overly verbose signature of propagation functions in all architectures. This is caused because we always need to pass the convolution parameters besides the actual inputs and outputs (strides, padding, kernel sizes are already 7 parameters that are often passed together). . One proposed solution is to capture them in a struct (perhaps called `ConvParams`) and then pass this struct around instead. I like this approach because it greatly simplifies the signatures. . An alternative approach could be to let the layer methods pass a pointer (or reference) to the calling object (`this`). The advantage is that the verbose functions accept different parameters, for example the forward prop expects the convolution parameters (stride, padding, kernel size) while the backward pass expects the input and output size. Passing a reference to the layer itself will allow each function to pick what it needs, thus allowing us to simplify all calls with a common strategy. I would like to hear opinions on which method to choose.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2321:298,update,update,298,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2321,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"This PR adds a new data source for `RDataFrame` that is able to provide data from SQlite `SELECT` queries. It will be useful for cvmfs, where we have file catalogs and monitoring information in sqlite files. For instance, one can do. auto rdf = ROOT::RDF::MakeSqliteDataFrame(""catalog.sqlite"", ""select * from catalog"");; auto h = rdf.Define(""lname"", ""name.length()"").Histo1D(""lname"");. to show the distribution of file name sizes. There are probably more use cases, for instance sqlite export of conditions data. This is work in progress, I'm posting it for early comments and feedback. My open points are. - Unit and integration tests are yet to be done; - The data source work single-threaded only at the moment. I initially thought it might be enough to return only a single row in `GetEntryRanges()` to make it thread-safe but that's apparently not enough. So I'm now thinking to wrap `SetEntry()` and `GetEntryRanges()` in a mutex.; - The code is not reusing `TSQLiteServer`. It felt like it requires stretching the `TSQLServer` interface in perhaps unwanted ways, for saving only a handful of direct sqlite API calls. On the other hand, with (probably quite a bit) more work it might be possible to have a more general data source that works on any SQL result set.; - Determining column types in SQlite is tricky as it is dynamically typed and in principle each row can have different column types. If a table column is queried as is, I can use the default/declared column type. For expressions, I'll use the type of the first row of the result set. Still it can result in a column to be of type `NULL` where subsequent rows actually have meaningful values. My guess is that the current heuristic is practical enough, and of course the user can formulate the `SELECT` query to avoid ambiguity.; - It would not be impossible to add support for remote reading of sqlite files. To do so, one can add a custom implementation of an sqlite virtual file system to have data pouring in directly from HTT",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2322:618,integrat,integration,618,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2322,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Deployability,"This PR extends the type templation that was already present in some classes in the GenVector library to improve support for using vectorised (Vc) types. Specifically it :-. 1. Extends the templation to the Plane3D, Transformation3D and Translation3D types.; 2. Where necessary provides specialised methods for the vector types, when the original code was not generic enough to work in both scalar and vector scenarios. Typically this happens in the case of conditionals, where the differences required (booleans versus masks) are difficult to avoid. This PR is not complete, in that there are still some classes in GenVector that still do not support Vc types, as they are still not templated, such as the Rotation like transformations. It would be nice to add this at some point, but the code associated to these is more extensive (3DConversions.cxx for instance) and that will require some work.

Deployability,"This PR propagates the disconnect action from TFileCacheRead to TFilePrefetch. This is needed to restore TFilePrefetch compatibility with the CMS use of kDoNotDisconnect to swap TTreeCaches. CMS frequently swaps TTree caches with code like. filePtr_->SetCacheRead(cache, nullptr , TFile::kDoNotDisconnect);; branch->GetEntry(entryNumber);; filePtr_->SetCacheRead(nullptr, nullptr , TFile::kDoNotDisconnect);. This is done partially for ownership reasons and partially because CMS uses multiple TTreeCaches for different use cases (one cache for frequently read branches, a second for less frequently accessed branches, and potentially one or two more specialized use cases). kDoNotDisconnect tells the TFile that this cache may later be reconnected to the TFile, so it should not disconnect the cache from the file. TFile propagates the flag to TFileCacheRead, but TFileCacheRead does not propagate it to TFilePrefetch. If pre-fetching is enabled, TFilePrefetch clears its cached blocks due to this commit:. https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/4290bf4942285b754b2edb7bffd122bcf36c979d. which added clearing of the read and pending prefetch lists when SetFile() is called. This violates the assumptions made by TTreeCache in the kDoNotDisconnect case, leading to a deadlock where `TTreeCache::ReadBufferPrefetch` waits forever on a buffer that has been cleared from the prefetched and pending lists. This patch propagates the kDisconnect/kDoNotDisconnect action flag to `TFilePrefetch::SetFile`, only clearing the fetched and pending lists in the kDisconnect case. (The same end could be accomplished more simply by just not calling TFilePrefetch::SetFile() for the kDoNotDisconnect case; propagating the action seems more correct to me, but it is a matter of taste.)",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1769:1412,patch,patch,1412,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1769,1,['patch'],['patch']

Deployability,"This Pull request refactors `RPageSourceDaos::LoadClusters()` to coalesce the fetch requests for pages in the same cluster bunch before calling `RDaosContainer::ReadV`, instead of launching a call to remote storage for the pages of each cluster separately. A cluster bunch corresponds to all clusters being fetched together by `LoadClusters()` at a time. . Since the call by `ReadV()` is ultimately blocking until all requests are done, this change enables the asynchronous page fetch requests from different clusters to share queue and flight time; thus, remote storage can parallelize them toward a higher read throughput. . The requests are still coalesced according to object ID and distribution key resulting from the mapping strategy in `kDefaultDaosMapping`.

The following features are part of the design:. * Full featured CMake build, based on https://github.com/GooFit/Minuit2; - Only requires CMake 3.1+; - Support for adding as a subdirectory, using from build directory, or installing; - Works inside of ROOT or standalone; - Support for CPack binary `make package`; - Options for MPI and OpenMP integrated with main ROOT build; - Support for macOS, Linux, and Windows; - Version captured from ROOT; - CTest support; - `make docs` support (CMake 3.8+ only); * No need for extra ""prepare"" shell scripts, everything is done cross-platform through CMake and CPack; - Files can be copied in to make redistributable source with `-Dminuit2-standalone=ON`; - `make package_source` on Unix creates `.tar.gz` and `.zip` files (non-binary CPack); - `make purge` can remove copied files; * Helpful `README.md` and `DEVELOP.md` files. ### To produce a source distribution:; Make sure you have CMake 3.1+ (ROOT requires 3.4.3+, so that's likely). Then, from `/math/minuit2/build` run:. ```bash; cmake .. -Dminuit2-standalone=ON; make package_source; make purge; ```. ### You can also build Minuit2 for testing (standalone option on or off) with:. ```; make; ```. ### And you can make a prebuilt binary package with:. ```; make package; ```. (Standard CPack option for different generators apply.). ### Maintenence. If new files are needed by Minuit2 due to additions to ROOT, they should be added to the source files lists in `/math/minuit2/src/Math/CMakeLists.txt` and `/math/minuit2/src/CMakeLists.txt` (depending on if it's a new Math or Minuit2 requirement). ### Windows; This works on Windows; and you can even then create binary installers for Windows trivially. (Though ""package_source"" does not seem to be supported on Windows). This is the procedure on Windows:. First, install Visual Studio 17, Git, CMake, and NSIS. Then from the `math/minuit2/build",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1680:328,install,installing,328,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/1680,2,"['install', 'integrat']","['installing', 'integrated']"

Deployability,"This adds gdb pretty printers for a few objects such as TString and TNamed, as well; as a couple of RooFit objects. gdb can automatically load them if `add-auto-load-safe-path`; is set to ROOT's lib directory.; The printers should only be installed during debug builds. A couple of things are still unclear:; - `file(COPY ...` is used to copy the printers into the build directory. This will only run when cmake is run, but not during make. The pretty-printers will therefore not get updated. Is that a problem? A solution should be to create targets that are being kept up-to-date by make.; - Is it correct to use `install(FILES ...)` to install?; - I added a roottest that starts root.exe in gdb, and tries to load the printers. This may fail; o With old gdbs; o With release builds. gdb should fail to load the printers because they are not installed. Probably, the test should be disabled during release builds.

Deployability,"This almost broke me... I've been trying to find for days why ROOT would not build correctly in one particular (fairly complicated) setup for me. I just couldn't figure out why I wouldn't get the files meant for the `etc/` directory in my installation. Turns out that it was because in this weird setup I put the ROOT source code into a directory inside of another CMake project, into a directory that had `/CMakeFiles/` as part of its path. And would you know, macOS still comes with a case insensitive file system, so this exclusion rule was triggering for the full contents of the `etc/` directory in this setup. After realising this, I modified my project's setup to put the ROOT source code into a safer location. But this update should still help people avoid a similar situation later on... P.S. I checked in a simple standalone example that this formalism should do the right thing.

Deployability,"This commit enables serialization of the Python proxy defined within cppyy to the C++ std::runtime_error class. By doing so, we avoid errors that happen in certain configurations of Dask tasks where a std::runtime_error may be thrown within the event loop itself. Recent CI failures report the following:. ```; RDataFrame::Run: event loop was interrupted; Warning in <TBufferFile::WriteObjectAny>: since runtime_error has no public constructor; 	which can be called without argument, objects of this class; 	can not be read with the current library.

This is due to the fact that for some reason the std::runtime_error object is serialized at the end of the function scope within the Dask task.

Deployability,"This commit removes some functions from the RooFit data classes:. * `RooAbsData::valid()` (virtual method that was overridden in; RooDataHist but not RooDataSet). * `RooDataHist::valid(std::size_t i)` and `RooDataHist::valid()`. * `RooDataHist::cacheValidEntries()`. The `cacheValidEntries` method was originally intended to be used in; `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` to mask histogram entries out of the variable; range in case of a subrange fit. The reasons why `cacheValidEntries` and; the related `valid()` methods should be removed are:. 1. It is redundant. In a subrange fit, the `RooAbsOptTestStatistic` is; creating a clone of the dataset with the subrange only using; `RooAbsData::reduce()`. So all entries are valid by definition. 2. RooDataHist and RooDataSet have inconistent implementations.

Deployability,"This follows up on a previous commit 92fbd0db47 with the title:; ```; [RF] Modernize `RooVectorDataStore::RealFullVector` class; ```. It changed the type of the `RooVectorDataStore::RealFullVector` members from `std::vector<double>*` to `std::unique_ptr<std::vector<double>>` while increasing the class version. However, while reasing old workspaces with the previous class version worked perfectly fine, there were logged errors when writing and then reading back a dataset with weight errors in ROOT `master`:. ```; TStreamerInfo::BuildOld:0: RuntimeWarning: Cannot convert RooVectorDataStore::RealFullVector::_vecE from type: vector<double> to type: vector<double>, skip element; TStreamerInfo::BuildOld:0: RuntimeWarning: Cannot convert RooVectorDataStore::RealFullVector::_vecEL from type: vector<double> to type: vector<double>, skip element; TStreamerInfo::BuildOld:0: RuntimeWarning: Cannot convert RooVectorDataStore::RealFullVector::_vecEH from type: vector<double> to type: vector<double>, skip element; ```. This was very unexpected. Maybe there is some problem with the IO of class members of type `std::unique_ptr<std::vector<double>>`. This commit suggests to fix this problem by using `std::vector<double>` directly, which makes the code much simpler anyway. It also allows us to get rid of a workaround in `RealFullVector::Streamer()` where it was not clear if this workaround is still needed or not.

Deployability,"This is a fix for ROOT-7121. If a cache is updated in RooVectorDataStore and the cache has more than 1000 elements to be updated, an array on the stack will overrun and smash the stack. roofit will therefore crash.

Comments on the speed of the fix:; Using a std::vector placed on the stack (mimicking the original implementation), the fits would get slower.

Deployability,"This is a followup to commit 47c250898f3. The new algorithm to figure out the servers of a RooRealIntegral could get very expensive for large computation graphs, as seen with the ATLAS Higgs combinaiton. The problem was that there was a loop over an arguments clients for each argument in the computation graph. In this commit, loop is replaced by another loop over the computation graph in which one iterates only over the servers of the arguments that depend on the integration variables. I think this logic is even more intuitive to understand as well. I learned also that iterating over clients is never a good idea, because while the number of servers is well defined, there can be arbitrary many clients, making the performance very unpredictable. It was verified with flamegraphs that the performance of the likelihood creation for the ATLAS Higgs combinaiton model is now again identical to the state before commit 47c250898f3.",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11619:468,integrat,integration,468,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11619,1,['integrat'],['integration']

Deployability,"This is a proposal for an update of the Python-related documentation of RDataFrame. The first commit just moves the Python-related docs from `RDataFrame.cxx` to `_rdataframe.py` (in the `_pythonization` folder), so that it is shown in the PyROOT box. The second commit does a bit of rewording / reordering of what was there; it also removes the part about `AsRNode` (to be discussed). The third commit adds a new subsection about the pythonizations of `Histo1D`, etc. to accept a tuple for the model argument. EDIT: to be discussed too what to do with the section ""Distributed execution in Python"", I think it deserves to be outside of the PyROOT box, but perhaps we could rename it to just ""Distributed execution"".

The code currently reads beyond the 80 03 at the end of the file by trying to determing the length of the following block - but an end of file block does not have a length, the file ends right after the end of file block tag 08 03. The length is in little endian format - as can be seen in the beginning of the file. The ascii block tag 80 01 is followed by fb 15 00 00 which is little endian for 000015fb.

Deployability,"This is a very early draft for caching `RNTuple`s. The goal is to save only the portions (clusters) of the original RNTuple that are actually read during an analysis to a new RNTuple . In this draft it is shown an attempt at exercising the part where the compressed clusters are saved during the IO pipeline already implemented in RClusterPool. To this end, an `RPageSink` is created at the beginning of the pipeline with the same header as the RNTuple being read. After the compressed cluster is retrieved in memory, its columns and pages are traversed and saved to the cached RNTuple. For now this feature can be reproduced with a very limited example, divided in three pieces; ### 1. Write an RNTuple; ```cpp; void write_ntuple(); {; auto model = RNTupleModel::Create();; auto myintfield = model->MakeField<int>(""myintfield"");; auto myintfieldsquared = model->MakeField<int>(""myintfieldsquared"");. std::string_view ntuplename{""myntuple""};; std::string_view filename{""myntuple.root""};; auto ntuple = RNTupleWriter::Recreate(std::move(model), ntuplename, filename);. constexpr int nentries = 10;; for (int i = 0; i < nentries; i++) {; *myintfield = i;; *myintfieldsquared = i*i;; ntuple->Fill();; // Create a cluster every 5 entries; if (i == 4 || i == 9) ntuple->CommitCluster();; }; }; ```; ### 2. Read the RNTuple (this will create a `cachedntuple.root` file); ```cpp; void read_ntuple(); {; std::string_view ntuplename{""myntuple""};; std::string_view filename{""myntuple.root""};; auto ntuple = RNTupleReader::Open(ntuplename, filename);. for (auto entryid: *ntuple){; ntuple->LoadEntry(entryid);; }; }; ```; ### 3.

The update to the Davix configuration should not be controversial, I just added arguments forcing Davix to use the same LibXml2 library found by ROOT as well. The update to VDT is a bit weirder though. 😦 Unfortunately VDT executes a python script simply by calling `python <script>` during the CMake configuration. If there is not `python` executable in `$PATH` at this time, that fails. Now, ideally the `python` name should not be hardcoded into the VDT code at all, it should be set dynamically to whatever [FindPythonInterp](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/module/FindPythonInterp.html) finds as `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE`. But I wanted to solve it at ""this level"" for now. So I changed the code to call CMake explicitly for configuring VDT, in an environment in which `python` should be available.

Deployability,"This is the second attempt for merging the bulk IO APIs (hidden inside the ROOT::Internal namespace); original version was in #943; this is a large rebase and update (particularly, removing the buffer sharing between the ROOT and the user). The initial goal here is to get another round of @pcanal attention and feedback. The bulk IO APIs aim to provide as fast access as possible in the case where the user is using relatively simple datatypes and the objects can be deserialized ""non-destructively"" (i.e., in-place in the existing memory buffers). For example - primitives and lists of primitives are supported; anything needing references are not. Despite the fact many of ROOT's very useful deserialization features are not supported, the limited feature set covers a range of analysis use cases. In particular, the current version of CMS's proposed NanoAOD format can be read solely via bulk APIs. Where the bulk IO APIs are applicable, we see an order-magnitude improvement in event rates for some use cases (including CMS NanoAOD). The speedup becomes more noticeable as the data read from the event is smaller (meaning the traditional ROOT IO overheads are larger). Somewhere in the neighborhood of 5KB objects read per event is the point where bulk IO APIs should be noticeably faster. This PR provides three interfaces:. * A raw, low-level interface. The user can invoke the bulk IO APIs directly and get a buffer of primitive types, serialized or deserialized. It is not envisioned this is used by users, but by API writers.; * A TTreeReader-like interface, TTreeReaderFast. This is meant to be used by users; it utilizes the low-level interface to retrieve the serialized buffer and templated code will inline the deserializing as part of iterating through the tree. The speed here is gained by the fact only a single pass in memory is needed to deserialize and apply user code, rather than two.; * The intent is that this interface can be extended in the future and used by TDataFrame, pr",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2519:159,update,update,159,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/2519,1,['update'],['update']

Deployability,"This patch consolidates the symbol resolution facilities throughout TCling into; a new singleton class Dyld part of the cling's DynamicLibraryManager. The new dyld is responsible for:; * Symlink resolution -- it implements a memory efficient representation of; the full path to shared objects allowing search at constant time O(1). This; also fixes issues when resolving symbols from OSX where the system libraries; contain multiple levels of symlinks.; * Bloom filter optimization -- it uses a stohastic data structure which gives; a definitive answer if a symbol is not in the set. The implementation checks; the .gnu.hash section in ELF which is the GNU implementation of a bloom; filter and uses it. If the symbol is not in the bloom filter, the; implementation builds its own and uses it. The measured performance of the; bloom filter is 30% speed up for 2mb more memory. The custom bloom filter on; top of the .gnu.hash filter gives 1-2% better performance.; The advantage for the custom bloom filter is that it works on all; implementations which do not support .gnu.hash (windows and osx). It is also; customizable if we want to further reduce the false positive rates; (currently at p=2%).; * Hash table optimization -- we build a hash table which contains all symbols; for a given library.

Deployability,"This patch is a tentative fix to JIRA bug [ROOT-9907](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/ROOT-9907) (TGeoNavigator::FindNextBoundaryAndStep yields nonsensical answers with overlapping volumes). The bug seems to be due to the fact that `/CUVE_1/FAIS_1/PLAQUE_2` fails the `Contains()` check on line 1416, despite the fact that (or because?) the point is exactly on the volume boundary. Therefore, `PLAQUE_2` is not considered **at all** for limiting the current step length, which is unsound. By suppressing the `Contains()` check, we allow `snext` to be set to 0.0, which is a sensible response in this situation. I am not sure whether suppressing this check is entirely reasonable. I perused the source code for a few `TGeoShape`s and I have the impression that `DistFromOutside()` returne `TGeoShape::Big()` if the point happens to be inside the shape, but I could not find any documentation where this post-condition is clearly spelt out. If this is true for any shape, then I would argue that it is safe to omit the `Contains()` check (at worst we will end up with `snext=TGeoShape::Big()`, which is exactly what we had with the check anyway). @agheata, I hope you can take a look at this patch. Perhaps you are also aware of other places in `TGeoNavigator` where it may be wise to apply a similar correction...?

It is obviously correct - since if you use dynamic_cast and then do NOT check for nullptr and happily dereference the result, you can as well use a static_cast - if the old code was correct, the new one is correct as well.

In particular, it allows the model to be updated at any time, even if entries have been already filled. To do so, a new flag is added to the column description, `kFlagDeferredColumn`, which indicates that the index of the first on-disk element in the column is not zero (i.e., the column was added at a later point during write). If the flag is set, an additional 64bit integer ($firstElementIndex$) specifies the global index of the first stored element.; Compliant implementations should yield synthetic data pages made up of `0x00` bytes when trying to read back elements in the range $[0, firstElementIndex-1]$. This ensures zero-initialized values for fields of any supported C++ type, including `std::variant<Ts...>` and collections such as `std::vector<T>`. ## Changes or fixes:; - Allow for including the index of the first element in a column in the column description.

Deployability,"This pull request extends `RPageSink` to allow for vector commit of sealed pages. The prototype of the new functions is as follows:; ```c++; virtual std::vector<RNTupleLocator> CommitSealedPageVImpl(std::span<RPageStorage::RSealedPageGroup> ranges);; void CommitSealedPageV(std::span<RPageStorage::RSealedPageGroup> ranges);; ```. These changes enable (parallel) vector writes in concrete backends, e.g. in DAOS. Derived classes that do not override the base implementation will see a sequence of calls to `CommitSealedPage()`. The first measurements of vector writes on DAOS based on this PR, indicate an improvement of _an order of magnitude_ in the write throughput. The refactor in this PR passes all the RPageSinkBuf tests. ## Changes or fixes:; - Add `CommitSealedPageV()` to the public interface of `RPageSink`. This function carries out a vector write of a number of sealed page ranges. Each range applies to a given columnId.; The default implementation of `CommitSealedPageVImpl()` sequentially calls `CommitSealedPageImpl()` for each page on each range, but derived classes can override it to provide an optimized implementation.; - Use `CommitSealedPageV()` in RPageSinkBuf. If a buffered column contains only sealed pages, commit the whole range; via `CommitSealedPageV()`.; - If all buffered columns consist solely of sealed pages, coalesce all pages to be committed in a single `CommitSealedPageV()` call that includes a sealed page range per column. ## Checklist:; - [X] tested changes locally; - [X] updated the docs (if necessary).

Note that storage backends may still provide their own page unsealing code, e.g. for custom memory allocation. ## Checklist:; - [x] tested changes locally; - [x] updated the docs (if necessary).

Deployability,"This pull request provides a page allocator that caches previous allocations up to a certain limit. The cache is thread-local and defaults to 16 pages per thread (~1MiB per thread for default-sized pages). This PR is largely based on the concepts in #8634. Reuse of memory allocations in `RPageAllocatorCache` not only reduces calls to the global allocator but also heap fragmentation. The global allocator is thread-safe albeit locked; thus, to also reduce contention, the cache in `RPageAllocatorCache` is thread-local.; Given the small size of the (per-thread) cache, the internal structure is a simple `std::deque`. Anything more complex is not justified at the moment of this writing. . **NOTE:** Performance evaluation (specially for the multi-threaded case) should be inserted here tomorrow. ## Changes or fixes:; - Add `RPageAllocatorCache`: this templated allocator returns pages that have at least the required capacity. `DeletePage()` does not immediately deallocate memory; instead, pages are returned to a thread-local cache, dropping the smallest allocated buffer if the cache is full. If a previous page cannot be recycled, the underlying allocator `AllocT` (`RPageAllocatorHeap` by default) is used to allocate memory.; - Change the signature of `RPageSource::UnsealPage()`: `SealPage()`, the counterpart of `UnsealPage()` takes an RPage and returns an RSealedPage. Make the interface of `UnsealPage()` symmetric and return an RPage.; - Make `UnsealPage()` use `RPageAllocatorCache` by default.; - Remove stray `RPageAllocator{File,Daos}` classes. ## Checklist:; - [X] tested changes locally; - [X] updated the docs (if necessary).

Deployability,"This pull-request fixes a couple of issues related to `roottest` branch sync'ing. See issue #8783 for more information. ## Changes or fixes:; - Checkout the correct `roottest` head/tag if root is at `latest-stable`. If the current checked out branch is `latest-stable`, resolve it to the latest merged head/tag (i.e. second parent of latest-stable), and use that to clone `roottest`. These two commands illustrate the proposed behavior:; ```bash; $ git for-each-ref --points-at=latest-stable^2 --format=%(refname:short); v6-24-06; $ git clone -b v6-24-06 https://github.com/root-project/roottest.git; ```. - If the checked out ref in `root` is a tag (e.g. as a result of `$ git checkout v6-24-06`), `roottest` is not cloned at the expected revision. The previous implementation relied on `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` to get the name of the checked out branch. While this works for branch heads, it fails for tags, i.e.; ```bash; $ git checkout v6-24-06; HEAD is now at 3b796f86a3 ""Update ROOT version files to v6.24/06.""; $ git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD; HEAD; ```; The proposed solution in this case is to use `git for-each-ref` (or alternatively `git describe`), i.e.; ```bash; $ git for-each-ref --points-at=HEAD --format='%(refname:short)'; v6-24-06; ```. ## Checklist:; - [X] tested changes locally.

Deployability,"Those 2 classes may or may not be the only 2 that have this kind of pattern in the wild, so it might be interesting to solve the underlying issue which is likely to be that `BindCppObject` is trying to bind to a type which has no interpreter info. So a fix could be to have either `CPyCppyy::BindCppObject` or `Cppyy::GetActualClass` to check for the presence of interpreter info before attempting to automatically bind to the ""actual class/type"". (In theory this should be done by testing `TClass::HasInterpreterInfo` but in this case it is returning an incorrect information and thus we have to use `TClass::GetClassInfo`). The change in behavior is that after this modification, `PyROOT/Cppyy` would no longer warn if the actual return type is inadvertently missing its interpreter info. However semantically this seems to be the right behavior, for example in our cases we would:; * have no warning; * PyROOT will report the type of the pointer as `TList`; * Usage of the meta routines (`IsA` and co.) would still give accurate information (access to the `TClass` for `TViewPubFunctions`); * Interfaces to the objects are the same as the one available from the equivalent C++ code (I.e. `TList`) (unless the user does an explicit dynamic_cast to the underlying type). * In other cases (for user provided functions and classes) where the interpreter information from the underlying class is missing by mistake (bad/broken configuration of the user code/libraries), the error/warning reporting about the missing interpreter info will be delayed until the user actually want to access the underlying class.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16177#issuecomment-2271797820:1425,configurat,configuration,1425,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16177#issuecomment-2271797820,1,['configurat'],['configuration']

You can immediately see that the color scale in rainbow is not continuous, which is then misleading for colour-blinded in a 2D plot (not so much in a 3D surf like this one). kCMYK is also not great because it's dark, then lighter, then half-dark again. Others like kAquamarine have almost no contrast, it would be almost impossible to see sth there. So that would be a quick way to separate them. The idea is that the grayscale should be as proportional as possible, and monotonously increasing or decreasing. Unless it is symmetrical, then it is fine to have white in the borders and black in the centre (for example for example an axis that goes between -40 degrees and + 40 degrees, the 0 has a meaning).

Deployability,"To summarize the current intent of the PR and my understanding of the comments here. The PR targets at limiting cling to find modulemap files all over the place. We have advanced the infrastructure so that this is feasible. If we pick up all possible modulemaps on the include paths we have less control and rootcling goes in the opposite direction -- to be able to control much better the environment in which it works (in a previous PRs we have limited the set of flags it can take). As a side effect of this it will fix the module redefinition errors seen in the LCG builds and when ROOT is installed. IIUC the comments are reasonable and suggesting to move away from the ROOT static configuration for the essential directories such as the etcdir, libdir, incdir and so on. IMO, this not part of the PR even though it touches these functions. I support fixing these issues, however, if we want to fix them we will have to write quite a bit of utility functions which already exist in libLLVMSupport. A potential way forward (outside of this PR) is to make libLLVMSupport available to FoundationUtils and then we can use getMainExecutable and so on to make ROOT detect its essential folders at runtime.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4553#issuecomment-543193289:594,install,installed,594,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/4553#issuecomment-543193289,2,"['configurat', 'install']","['configuration', 'installed']"

Deployability,"Today, I discovered that `ROOT::TestSupport` does not always work as intended: Consider a ROOT7 build without IMT, and the unit tests `tree/ntuple/v7/test/ntuple_extended` and `tree/ntuple/v7/test/ntuple_storage`. Both call `ROOT::EnableImplicitMT()` which results in a warning (this should be fixed separately). `TestSupport.cxx` has a `ForbidDiagnostics noDiagCheckerInstance` that should call `SetErrorHandler` and fail the test if there is an unexpected diagnostic. It turns out this works fine for `ntuple_extended` (which is currently failing in configurations without IMT), but not for `ntuple_storage`. The reason seems to be that `ntuple_storage` doesn't use any other code from `ROOT::TestSupport`, and because it's a static library (since https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/9528) the linker can just skip it. (This was different for the object library before, there you link in the individual object files.). I'm not sure what the best solution is: Is it possible and reasonable to install object libraries? If not, an ugly approach is to emit an undefined symbol from `TestSupport.hxx` that will force the linker to add the static library...",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12828:552,configurat,configurations,552,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/12828,2,"['configurat', 'install']","['configurations', 'install']"

Deployability,"Two substantive changes:; 1) Explicitly catch errors in pyroot when the wrapper function fails to compile (this is actually an expanded version of a partial fix which is already upstream in cppyy: https://github.com/wlav/cppyy-backend/commit/8de6ed5ffcabaeba52fba5b8471149c6bb1fe71d); 2) Make sure template instantiation fails by catching clang errors within LookupHelper and rolling back the transaction where appropriate (still not entirely sure this is exactly the right fix, @Axel-Naumann @jalopezg-git please take a look); 3) Implement a mechanism for redirecting cling diagnostics to a user provided ostream and use this in cppyy to capture the diagnostic output and append it to the python exceptions or warnings as appropriate. This PR fixes https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11854. There are still some remaining problems with the transaction rollback, however template instantiation from cppyy now behaves the same as calling ```TInterpreter::Declare``` in this respect. This is likely related to the issues described by @jalopezg-git in https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/12449#issuecomment-1467860880 and can be fixed in a future PR. Consider the following test case:. test.h:; ```cpp; template <typename T>; class Helper {. public:.

Deployability,"Unfortunately this change was not fortunate for every single external. :frowning:. As we found in the ATLAS externals, setting [CMP0135](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/policy/CMP0135.html) to `NEW` with autoconf/automake based externals is a very bad idea. Because it has a very high chance of making those projects want to re-generate their configurations with automake. But if the build machine doesn't have **exactly** the same version of automake installed that the external package was generated with originally, you run into issues like:. ```; WARNING: 'aclocal-1.15' is missing on your system.; You should only need it if you modified 'acinclude.m4' or; 'configure.ac' or m4 files included by 'configure.ac'.; The 'aclocal' program is part of the GNU Automake package:; <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake>; It also requires GNU Autoconf, GNU m4 and Perl in order to run:; <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf>; <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>; <http://www.perl.org/>; ```.

Deployability,"Unfortunately this is the sort of issue that could have been easier to track/discuss on JIRA. But since ROOT doesn't use that anymore, here we go... My suspicion is that the grid nodes in question put some locally installed XRootD version high up in the library search path of the jobs. I don't know how they would do that, but that's my educated guess. ATLAS analysis releases using ROOT 6.18/04 (https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/1.0.65/External/ROOT/CMakeLists.txt) use XRootD 4.10.0 (https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/1.0.65/External/XRootD/CMakeLists.txt). While releases using ROOT 6.16/00 (https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/1.0.60/External/ROOT/CMakeLists.txt) used XRootD 4.8.4 (https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/atlasexternals/-/blob/1.0.60/External/XRootD/CMakeLists.txt). My educated guess is that the XRootD version force fed into your jobs @rdschaffer is binary compatible with XRootD 4.8.4, but not with 4.10.0 (or newer). However we definitely need some follow up from our grid experts on this. @rodwalker would it be possible to look at the problematic jobs / grid nodes for this?.

Deployability,"Unlike histograms, `TGraph` points are not necessarily stored in memory in ascending ""X"" coordinate pattern. Generaly speaking, when adding points to the `TGraph`, they are not sorted with respect to their X values. I noticed that this breaks the fitting algorithm. . In my particular case, the `TGraph` was filled ""backwards"" - starting with points with larger X values and adding points in decreasing X. Graph plots just fine and visually looks just the same the same as if it was filled in ascending X manner. However, a simple `""gaus""` fit did not converge and ended up having a negative normalization constant (`Constant` fitting parameter). # This Pull request:; Modifies the way the `BinData` object is populated with `TGraph` points. Instead of adding `TGraph`'s points to the `BinData` in the same pattern they are aligned in the memory, we add points to the `BinData` in strictly ascending order of their X values, starting with lowest. ## Changes or fixes:; An `indexRemap` vector is created prior to populating the `BinData` object for a `TGraph`. This vector governs a new iteration strategy for the `TGraph` points allowing for the adding of the graph points to the `BinData` starting with points with lowest X coordinate values and in ongoing ascending order. ## Checklist:. - [ yes ] tested changes locally; - [ not needed ] updated the docs (if necessary)",MatchSource.ISSUE,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11183:1341,update,updated,1341,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/11183,1,['update'],['updated']

Deployability,"Up to now all ES6 modules were loaded with relative path like `./jsrootsys/modules/core.mjs`. ; This works nice when all used code is located in one sub-directory `./jsrootsys/` which is alias for `$ROOTSYS/js`.; But this does not work when other location has to be used and modules have to reference jsroot code. Solution provided by modern browsers is `importmap` which can look like:; ```; <script type=""importmap"">; {; ""imports"": {; ""jsroot"": ""./jsrootsys/modules/main.mjs"",; ""jsroot/draw"": ""./jsrootsys/modules/draw.mjs"",; ""jsroot/io"": ""./jsrootsys/modules/io.mjs"",; ""jsrootsys/"" :: ""./jsrootsys/""; }; }; ```. This allow to use `import { draw } from 'jsroot';` syntax - including different external modules. Therefore add support of ""importmap"" in `THttpServer` which automatically insert appropriate map if `<!--jsroot_importmap-->` comment appears in HTML file. . Old HTML files with JSROOT import via relative path will work as before. ; But newer JSROOT HTML files with absolute path will not work with older ROOT versions - may be backport to 6.32 and 6.30 can be done later. Special handling of Qt5 is provided - while used there chromium version does not support importmap :(. ; Nevertheless all ROOT web widgets will be working. Provide `tutorials/webgui/custom` demo with usage of user-defined modules for support of custom user classes `TTriangle`. Demo should run witth ACLiC to provide dictionary for the class. Several changes in TWebCanvas and RWebWindowsManager class were done to let configure custom modules paths and register custom classes.; Macro also works in batch mode where workaround has to be implemented - until headless browser will allow to use ES6 modules directly from the file system.

Deployability,"Update: I added the left-most column (`Entry`) to the whole fTable. Regarding the dashes (`---`) between the entries, I realized that the width of the table is not known before the full creation, since there is `EnsureWidth` method, which is called upon trying to fit an element into the table, and thus, it might happen that an element from the last row increases the total width of the fTable. And therefore, I find it expensive to go trough the whole table again just to add the dashes. I suggest that the `Print()` method includes the dashes, while `AsString()` does not. But still,`AsString()` shows the `Entry` column as it is part of the table. For example:; ```; Print():; Entry | S2 | ; ------------; 0 | 0 | ; | 0 | ; ------------; 1 | 0 | ; | 0 | ; ------------; 2 | 0 | ; | 0 | ; ------------; AsString(); Entry | S2 | ; 0 | 0 | ; | 0 | ; 1 | 0 | ; | 0 | ; 2 | 0 | ; | 0 | ; | |; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9116#issuecomment-949385614:0,Update,Update,0,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/9116#issuecomment-949385614,1,['Update'],['Update']

Deployability,"Update:. After a very productive chat with @eguiraud we found out that this time `TTree::ChangeFile` is not trying to delete the `TBufferMergerFile`s attached to the `TBufferMerger`, but the `TFileMerger` attached to said `TBufferMerger`. The initial patch does not work since the `fOutputFile` member of `TFileMerger` is not a derivate of `TMemFile` and is the one that is getting changed in the process. The design of `TFileMerger` is of using `fOutputFile` as the file where all the data is merged, so of course it should never be deleted.

Deployability,"Updates of the day:. ### 1; @Axel-Naumann suggested creating targets for the builtin_xrootd libraries . This should in theory give us the possibility of changing target properties through something like; `set(TARGET libXrdSecpwd-4 PROPERTY INSTALL_RPATH ${CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_LIBDIR})`. We still want to keep all the building process in the `ExternalProject_Add` step, thus these new targets would be created as IMPORTED libraries. But unfortunately, CMake doesn't allow to install IMPORTED libraries as TARGETS ([SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41179630), [CMake developer citation](https://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=14311) ). ### 2; I tried to create a post install script that manually invokes `install_name_tool` to change the rpath from the build directory to the install directory. This would be called in `SearchInstalledSoftware.cmake` through something like; `install(SCRIPT ""${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/modules/XROOTDPostInstall.cmake"")`; and the script itself would work along these lines; ```; file(GLOB XROOTD_ALL_LIBRARIES; ""${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/libXrd*""; ); find_program(INSTALL_NAME_TOOL install_name_tool). if(INSTALL_NAME_TOOL); foreach(XRD_LIB_PATH ${XROOTD_ALL_LIBRARIES}); set(OLD_RPATH ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/lib); set(NEW_RPATH ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib); execute_process(COMMAND ${INSTALL_NAME_TOOL} -rpath ${OLD_RPATH} ${NEW_RPATH} $$; endforeach(); endif(); ```; The problem with this idea, if not for its ad-hoc nature, is that `install_name_tool` would actually be called each time `cmake --install` is called causing errors from the second time since ${OLD_RPATH} is not set to the `build` folder anymore:; ```; error: install_name_tool: no LC_RPATH load command with path: /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/lib found in: /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/install/lib/libXrdClient.dylib (for architecture x86_64), required for specified option ""-rpath /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/build/lib /Users/sftnight/vpadulan/install/lib""; ```",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6128#issuecomment-672083860:0,Update,Updates,0,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6128#issuecomment-672083860,8,"['Update', 'install']","['Updates', 'install']"
Deployability,"Updates on the failing tests:; * Centos8/multicore: Failure because the same wrong mechanism of changing files happens in `FinalizeSlot` instead of `Finalize` in `SnapshotHelperMT`. Weirdly this didn't happen on my machine with 8 threads but it does on this node with 16 threads, still not sure what's the real difference there.; * MacOS: Both failures happen in the dataframe test, but in the **single threaded** Snapshot, that is in the `Finalize` method of the `SnapshotHelper` class. At first this PR wasn't even considering the single threaded case, that's also why `SnapshotHelper` wasn't modified. So there was this difference between the single threaded Snapshot that still used the weird ChangeFile behaviour (although it shouldn't have triggered a segfault anyway since it's using a plain TFile), and the multithreaded Snapshot that got its behaviour changed to avoid the issue. Considering both types of failures, and the fact that a coherent behaviour across the two Snapshot modes is desirable, I would refactor the usage of `TTree::SetMaxTreeSize` inside of RDF Snapshot in a single common point that both single-thread and multi-thread operations have to go through, if that exists. Or in alternative, the workaround should be done at construction time of both helpers and then removed at destruction time (or in `Initialize` and `Finalize` methods).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6570#issuecomment-720955137:0,Update,Updates,0,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6570#issuecomment-720955137,1,['Update'],['Updates']

For the rest I stayed with using arrays to stay similar to all other TGraph objects. I moved the functions GetPointX, GetPointY, SetPointX, SetPointY and GetObjectInfo to the TGraph class because they apply to any TGraph object and only were in my custom class cause I could not implement them in TGraph without using a custom Root installation. I replaced the funtion SetNErrorDimensions by the functions AddYError and DeleteYError as proposed by @lmoneta. Since I think the meaning of ""dimension"" might not be 100% clear, I exchanged it to a term claryfing that it corresponds to different y errors. Besides that I implemented some further features and fixed a memory leak in the function PaintGraphMultiErrors in the TGraphPainter class.

Deployability,"When the user passes a gradient to the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` via inheriting from the `ROOT::Math::IMultiGradFunction`, the error level is only considered correctly if `SetFunction()` is **called after** `SetErrorDef()`, which is completely unexpected. This should either be fixed, or if not possible, the minimizer should error out if you try to set the function too early. This bug is the reason why it took me so long to figure out to use the analytical gradient provided by `clad` in the minimizer for RooFit: I just couldn't understand why the uncertainties were wrong and until now thought it was because the gradient was wrong or not handled correctly by the minimizer.

Deployability,"When using `RooGenericPdf` to implement custom PDF's, fitting becomes quite slow due to the use of numerical integration. This becomes a big problem when one needs to be perform several fits on the PDF (such as when studying systematical errors or statistical significances). It would be great if we could set an expression for the analytical integral the same way we already do for the PDF itself. As concrete example, if one needed to implement a PDF such as `f(x) = a/x + b*x + c`, it feels like we should be able to do; ```c; // Define custom pdf; RooGenericPdf my_pdf(""my_pdf"", ""x[1]/x[0] + x[2]*x[0] + x[3]"", RooArgList(x, a, b, c));; // Set formula for analytical integral; my_pdf.SetAnalyticalIntegralFormula(""x[1]*TMath::Log(x[0]) + x[2]*x[0]*x[0]/2 + x[0]*x[3]"");; ```. This would be implemented in such way that just creating an `RooGenericPdf` object would set it to numerical integration by default, and then calling `SetAnalyticalIntegralFormula()` would make it use analytical integration based on the supplied formula.

Deployability,"With multiple concurrent `RNTupleFillContext`s, the order of clusters is generally indeterminate and entries are only partially ordered. With staged cluster committing, this restriction can be partially lifted by splitting a cluster commit into two phases:; 1. Once full, or when manually triggered, all fields are committed which triggers flushing of all columns. All pages are compressed and staged via the page sink. The result is a `RStagedCluster` that records all information for the second phase. This step can be repeated multiple times as entries are filled into the context.; 2. When appropriate for the application, all staged clusters can be committed, which logically appends them to the RNTuple. This is implemented in a single critical section, which guarantees that the clusters and their entries are consecutive. Moreover, by synchronizing the second phase between multiple contexts, the application can enforce a total ordering of all contained entries at reasonable resource consumption: During the first phase, all write buffers are flushed and will be reused for the following cluster. The metadata stored in `RStagedCluster` should require only minimal memory, which will accumulate while staging more clusters. Staged cluster committing is expected to be slightly slower than the default mode, but should still scale well as the second phase only updates the metadata which is a lightweight operation compared to preparing and filling entries, compressing pages, and writing them to disk. A noteworthy disadvantage is that staged cluster committing will lead to non-linear files, where sequentially iterating over clusters may require seeking to distant file offsets. The impact resulting from this will depend on the storage technology and the read pattern.

Try to reproduce the problem with vanilla lli of LLVM 9 to check that this is not related to the way Cling incrementally JITs and executes.

Deployability,"Yes, it is clearly a difference is setup. In the failing one the `BLAS` library is not installed (or not found) and the real problem is that this result in a very obscure and hard to understand failure:; ```; IncrementalExecutor::executeFunction: symbol 'saxpy_' unresolved while linking [cling interface function]!; IncrementalExecutor::executeFunction: symbol 'sgemm_' unresolved while linking [cling interface function]!; ```; Instead we should either; * fail to configure if BLAS is missing; or ; * disable the components that require BLAS when configuring whe BLAS is missing; or; * disable the test that require BLAS when BLAS is not there. and at the very least we should list somewhere (if not already done so, but I don't see it) that the `BLAS` library is required to successfully run the tests and some of the features.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,root-project,root,v6-32-06,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/16720#issuecomment-2425048725:87,install,installed,87,https://root.cern,https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/16720#issuecomment-2425048725,1,['install'],['installed']

Deployability,"Yes, of course. There is code to explicitly detect and remove the allocator.
