Testability,"Closes #4782 ; Closes #5959. We should discuss a few issues, and modify/cleanup if necessary, before this goes in (if it does at all). In particular, I'd like to understand the original intent behind using the /root directory (e.g., in all of our WDLs) and make sure we don't break typical downstream uses by instead using /gatk; we could even consider ""deprecating"" this over a few releases. I think it's also worth discussing whether we want to continue to release a rootful image, but perhaps parameterize the Docker build script to easily allow the building of an image with a non-root user. I must admit that I don't have good visibility on the various use cases of our Dockers (outside of our typical use with Terra/Cromwell), so if any users would like to chime in, that would certainly be appreciated. In particular, users may still have to do some work on their end to remap user namespaces. In any case, this is at least a proof-of-principle that mounting resources is possible within our test framework with the option for a non-root user. So unless we have other good reasons for requiring a root user, it seems worthwhile to at least allow this option, even if we don't make that the new default.

Testability,"Closes #7884. The bug was caused by two position-only checks that should have been contig+position checks. I added a minimal regression test that uses a 2-record snippet of the test data discussed in the first post of the issue. Also discussed there is expected behavior that this fix does not induce. It seems the expectation is that a QUAL = 0 variant block should be turned into a GQ0 reference block. However, I wonder if this is not actually representative of the current (pre-fix) behavior of the tool. For example, if the test data is run only over chr13 using master, the position is not dropped (since then the position-only checks are valid). In that case, we do not see a GQ0 reference block; we instead see a GQ40 reference block, since the original record had GQ61. With the fix, we reproduce this reference block. So although we do not induce the expected GQ0 behavior, I would say the bug is fixed. Whether or not we should issue an additional fix to induce the expected GQ0 behavior is another question entirely. I'm not completely sure what the expected behavior should be from the tool or code documentation alone. Someone more familiar with this tool (@droazen perhaps you can suggest?) may have to chime in. They should probably also check that the contig+position checks are all that need to be added to address the original bug; I'm not 100% sure about behavior there either, but at least all other integration tests seem to still pass.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8028:136,test,test,136,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8028,4,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"

This motivated the following changes:. - don't write to VCF directly, instead have take a Consumer to emit VariantContexts. This lets us provide a different consumer in unit tests to collect our result.; - we previously had a chain of calls createVariantsFromSortedRanges -> processSampleRecordsForLocation -> finalizeCurrentVariant that returned void and as a side effect wrote to VCF.

Testability,"Considering that this PR has lasted through my absence and the holiday season, I want to take the chance of summarizing the concerns you have issued here:. --------. Resolved as requested (or at least made efforts to):. * documenting the logic and methods; documented. * emit VCF instead of custom file format; emit both VCF custom file format now. * bug in determining if alignment signature satisfies `allMiddleAlignmentsDisjointFromAlphaOmega`; bug fixed in commit b4f7568b03b91eb77d256bcfe8117001bce040ec. --------. Unresolved yet:; the fact that gap split happens after the alignment configuration scoring step is considered backwards. I agree in principle but due to AS and MQ were used in the scoring step, and split-copy leads to technically wrong AS & MQ, I originally decided to score first, then split. Splitting the gapped alignments was introduced originally to have a centralized logic in inferring type and location of the events. . The tension is that AS is used in the scoring but becomes practically useless after that. >> Correct, but I am having thoughts about this now (not to pick only one—that; would be wrong—but to ditch them altogether probably under some condition; and redo the alignment step), exactly because of this behavior I observe.; Think about the case where one originating gapped (say insertion); alignment, after splitting, has one of the two children contained in; another alignment (not its sibling, that's impossible) in terms of their; read span. Now the originating gapped alignment probably should be filtered; out, or not, because if we keep it, an insertion would be called but; apparently there are alternative explanations due to the other alignment.; I'm not sure how to deal with this case, and if this scenario is common; enough. It probably is the case that such alignments happen mostly in STR; regions, so getting the exact alignments correct there is no easy task.; ; > Is that enough of a concern to worry about.

Testability,"Copying in some discussion about my initial, incorrect, effort in PR #2547:. David Roazen:; As discussed in person, we fully support the mission of making this class less stateful (and particularly making it so that `isVcCoveredByDeletion()` does not modify state, which was the original ticket), but we're concerned that this method `calculateOutputAlleleSubset()` was intended to be stateful, and to accumulate deletions across calls. It's also not well covered by tests, so this change could easily break the method. Can you think about this issue and reply here once you've looked into it, davidbenjamin ? Also at-mentioning ronlevine to solicit his comments, since he appears to have added `upstreamDeletionsLoc` to this class in the first place. Ron Levine; droazen Is correct. It was intended to maintain state for upstream deletions. Make sure the upstream spanning deletion does not span shard barriers, then there will be problems with the book keeping. AFAIK, shards overlap genome locations but for a large spanning deletion, the size might not be sufficient. davidbenjamin Here is the motivation for the change: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/issues/1188 and accompanying pull request, [Removed spanning deletions if the deletion was removed](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gsa-unstable/pull/1417).

Testability,"Copying over some discussion from Slack, with some slight modifications:. > I took a quick stab at updating the environment for gCNV. Even taking out TensorFlow (assuming that the CNN will not be supported by this environment), it's a difficult task:; > 1. The goal is to update Python from 3.6 to 3.10+, since Terra now requires the latter for officially supported images.; > 2. However, gCNV relies on the PyMC3 package. PyMC3 3.1 is currently used in GATK master. 3.1 was released in 2017, not long before our release of gCNV in 2018, but it's very old now.; > 3. The latest version of Python that is supported by PyMC3 3.1 in conda is Python 3.6.; > 4. @asmirnov239 has a draft PR (#8094) that updates PyMC3 to 3.5 and Python to 3.7, which clearly still falls short of Python 3.10+. This PR also updated some gCNV code to make it compatible with PyMC3 3.5. (It also removed TensorFlow and added PyTorch.); > 5. @asmirnov239 also merged a PR that added tests for numerical reproducibility of GermlineCNVCaller in cohort mode in #7889.; > 6. The earliest version of PyMC that supports Python 3.10+ is PyMC 4, released in 2022.; > 7. However, PyMC 4 introduces API changes, which will also require additional gCNV code changes and numerical testing.; > 8. These API changes are because the underlying computational backend for PyMC was updated from Theano (think of this as an old alternative to TensorFlow) to Aesara.; > 9. Since then, PyMC 5.9 has been released and the underlying backend has been updated again, from Aesara to PyTensor.; > 10. So if we are going to update the environment to support Python 3.10+, it probably makes sense to go all the way to PyMC 5.9.

To complete this task would mean simply adding some new tests and possibly uploading to our LFS storage some data that appropriately covers the use case to make sure we don't accidentally break these functionalities in embarrassing ways going forwards.

To alleviate this, it would be nice to add a ReadFilter level interval argument, for example an `IntervalOverlapReadFilter` or some such which can take similarly formatted arguments to -L.

One initializes the parents to random values, calls the function, and checks whether it has had any side effects on the parents. One must make a random-data-provider-of-some-sort for each parent node because the parent INDArrays have different shapes. For other functions in CoverageModelEMComputeBlock and CoverageModelEMWorkspace that query ICG nodes -- one needs to create a firewall. One can elevate all such functions to classes that essentially behave functionally, (ICGNodeProvider, List<NodeKey>, extra arguments) -> output, as opposed to writing vanilla member functions such as CoverageModelEMComputeBlock.getBiasLatentPosteriorDataUnregularized, etc. Then we can write automated unit tests for these classes. Another approach is to write a thin ImmutableNDArray interface that blocks access to all mutators and returns instances of ImmutableNDArray when a matrix view is extracted (e.g. via INDArray.get(...)).

It sheds some additional light on this issue and explains why we believe that fine-tuning of the error model introduced in Mutect2 4.1.9.0 led to overcalling of variants in samples with increased (but not pathologic) DNA degradation. Presentation of the poster led to several interesting discussions with other users of Mutect2 at the conference. Given these results, I would propose that you could expose the parameter you newly set in commit [a304725](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/a304725a60f5000ec6381040137043a557fc3dc1) `private static final int ONE_THIRD_QUAL_CORRECTION = 5;` as a user-facing command line parameter. In this manner, you could leave the parameter at `5` by default but allow users who work on clinical (especially FFPE) samples to change it to `0` instead, thus effectively restoring the behaviour shown (and benchmarked) prior to 4.1.9.0.

But another cooperative team cannot find the same results or similar frequency from the same data, based on the combination algorithm of log R Ratio and B Allele Frequency. It seems that the GATK germline CNV calling pipeline did not use log R Ratio or B Allele Frequency method from SNP data, right? We have discussions about this, and my collogues think that potential CNV events should be supported by the log R Ratio and B Allele Frequency evidence, even though they seem look good in IGV with BAM file.

Testability,"Dear developers,; At present, I am using GATK's CombineGVCFs module in AWS platform to merge gvcf of 30 samples respectively according to different chromosomes. This species has 10 chromosomes, so a total of 10 CombineGVCFs tasks are carried out in parallel (10 EC2 virtual machines are opened respectively). The input gvcf file is stored in S3 and mounted to the EC2 VM. In this process, java.io.IOException occurs after some samples are analyzed: The Transport endpoint is not connected, but the merged gvcf file and its index are still produced. I did not find any feedback about GATK relation on the Internet, so I would like to know the reason for the error and why some staining machines reported errors. Some will not report errors, in addition, will the gvcf file generated after the ""Transport endpoint is not connected"" prompt be used? At present, I have tried gatk4.5, 4.4, 4.2 and other versions, and this has happened.

Testability,"Did a quick test with sklearn's BayesianGaussianMixture, fitting 8 components to 2.5M 10D points generated from 4 isotropic blobs. On a Google Colab instance (which I believe are n1-highmem-2s), 150 iterations (which I think is the current maximum) completed in 14 minutes, with `%memit` reporting a memory peak of ~1.5GB. Note that convergence within the default tolerance isn't actually reached in 150 iterations for this toy data (as usual, it takes a while for the weights of unused components to shrink to zero). In any case, we'd have to compare against the number of iterations currently required to converge with the real data (and perhaps also check that the convergence criteria match up) to get a better idea of real runtime. Various tweaks to priors or other runtime options (such as k-means vs. random initialization) could also affect convergence speed. Minibatching isn't built in, but I think it should be pretty trivial to hack together something with the `warm_start` option; we could probably just do a warm start with a subset of the data.

Testability,During the discussion in fixing a bug in the GenotypeQuality score #7120 it came to light that when using posteriors for genotyping that the calculation in getGQLog10FromPosteriors() for computing the GQ is doing something a little different from the other codepath for calculating the GQ score. Specifically it is calculating the GQ as the difference in score between the first (selected) genotype and the second best genotype (after normalization for both) plus the log math addition of the other scores in the array. What this means in practice is that the score will be less than the first minus the second calculation especially if there were other marginal options with similar scores to the calls. This approach was implemented for the DRAGEN-GATK pipleine and currently will only change the scores there. Its worth discussing if we need this extra step or can rely on the old GQ calculation.

Testability,EN they do something different that we had to replicate to achieve concordance. Dragen still performs equivalent modifications for steps 1-3 as they apply to the reads but rather than performing step 4 and using those reads for genotype assignment it instead for genotyping reaches back for each read (that has survived filtering) to its original BAM alignment (before being unclipped/hardclipped) and uses those reads for FRD/BQD calling. When running GATK with the new argument `--use-original-alignments-for-genotyping-overlap` this is what happens as well (step 4 is skipped entirely in addition). The results were somewhat surprising (listed below): . ![RealignmentPlotIndels](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16102845/87588690-13fc4680-c6b2-11ea-98e9-4c69259c2869.png); ![RealignmentPlotSNPs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16102845/87588692-1494dd00-c6b2-11ea-96dc-ba06f45357c2.png). This says that running GATK in DRAGEN mode without realigning reads performs slightly better for low complexity region SNPs than it does with realignment. This could perhaps be a side effect of the BQD algorithm as it cares about the specific bases that are applied for SNPs. I have theorized that perhaps the explanation for this behavior has to do with the fact that the reads at stage 4 have undergone 2 different rounds of clipping (at stages 1 and 2) and could in actuality be as short as 11 bases long by this stage. If this is indeed the problem then realigning the reads (without anchoring information from the rest of the read that might have resulted in more accurate placement) might well result in significant noise as to where reads actually get placed after realignment. A necessary step to completing this ticket would have to be evaluating what sites account for the lost sensitivity and understanding why the realignment is responsible and evaluating if there is not a better way to perform the realignment that can handle these short stubs if indeed they are the problem.,MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6706:3757,stub,stubs,3757,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6706,1,['stub'],['stubs']

This makes sense -- we modify the quals to reflect that sequencing errors are independent but PCR errors are not. However, `HALF_OF_DEFAULT_PCR_ERROR_QUAL` is 20, so if we start out with high-quality UMI reads we basically kill the quality and with it our SNV sensitivity. Note that in the very important application of cfDNA basically every base is an overlap. What's worse is that Mutect2 later throws out one of the reads, so that we could start out with two BQ = 60 reads and end up with one BQ = 20 read!. @fleharty @yfarjoun This is a problem.

Testability,"Executive summary: . My main concern is that the amount of unsupported code is continuing to grow. Adding this PR would bring the total to about ~5k lines of WDL, Java, and test code. In comparison, the amount of corresponding supported CNV code clocks in around ~33k---this includes all of gCNV, as well! Development time has also been non-negligible and dates back to pre-4.0 release. Another concern is that the number of users of this unsupported code is also growing. In fact, it seems like we are actively pointing users to it. This seems unsustainable going forward. Finally, I don't think we have satisfactorily demonstrated which of the functions accomplished by this code (format conversion, post-hoc blacklisting, germline/""CNLOH"" tagging and imputation) are necessary or cannot be performed by existing code or more streamlined and principled methods. (Some of these functions, such as IGV conversion, are already performed by existing code.) Of those functions, I think format conversion is the only one we should retain from this code in an unsupported fashion. So if this PR introduces a useful GISTIC conversion, no harm in merging that. This all sounds like a decision for the new tech lead! @mwalker174 any thoughts? . More detailed responses follow:. > Users are already using this branch and giving me positive feedback (definitely more positive than adjusting num_changepoints_penalty_factor). I suggest merging mostly for practical reasons. It buys us more time to put in a principled solution. And this workflow is clearly marked as an unsupported prototype anyway (as are the GATK CLIs). I want to emphasize that this whole workflow is not a long-term solution. In other words, I would like to get this in and then focus on a supported solution. While it's great that users are giving positive feedback, I refer you to CellBender team's manifesto at https://github.com/broadinstitute/CellBender/commit/28f02f8dbd716aff922bb8da1e56da29347b245b.

Testability,"ExtractVariantAnnotations:. This tool extracts annotations, labels, and other relevant metadata from variants (or alleles, in allele-specific mode) that do or do not overlap with specified resources. The former are considered labeled and each variant/allele can have multiple labels. The latter are considered unlabeled and can be randomly downsampled using reservoir sampling; extraction of these is optional. The outputs of the tool are HDF5 files containing the extracted data for labeled and (optional) unlabeled variant sets, as well as a sites-only VCF containing the labeled variants. This VCF can be used in ScoreVariantAnnotations to in turn specify an additional ""extracted"" label, which can be useful for indicating those sites that were actually extracted from the provided resources (since we may only extract over a subset of the genome). TODOs:; - [x] Integration tests. Putting together tests using chr1:1-10M snippets of 1) the 1kgp-50-exomes sites-only VCF for the input (since this has both non-AS and AS annotations; EDIT: Scratch that, it only has AS_InbreedingCoeff and AS_QD), 2) the Omni SNP training/truth VCF (yielding ~3.5k training), and 3) the Mills training/truth VCF (yielding ~500 training). Incidentally, VariantRecalibrator SNP and INDEL runs both fail to converge on these small training sets without the #7709 fix, but do converge with it. I still need to check if enough multiallelics are included here; if not, I'll choose a different snippet. EDITEDIT: Now using gs://broad-gotc-test-storage/joint_genotyping/exome/scientific/truth/master/gather_vcfs_high_memory/small_callset_low_threshold.vcf.gz provided by @ldgauthier, which does have AS annotations.; ; We'll use expected outputs here as inputs to downstream steps, but rather than provide the expected outputs directly, we'll create copies of them and provide those as inputs.

Testability,"Finished refactoring the production code as detailed above, just need to add some tests. Results are exactly the same as before in single-sample mode---except for allele-fraction-only mode. This is because I refactored all existing segmenters (there were separate ones for copy-ratio-only, allele-fraction-only, and copy-ratio + allele-fraction) as special cases of a single multisample segmenter; however, the Gaussian kernel in the old allele-fraction-only segmenter was missing a normalization factor that is now present in the new multisample segmenter. Thus, users who previously ran in allele-fraction-only mode will have to retune parameters to achieve the same level of sensitivity. I expect that this will be a very small number of users (if any---note that allele-fraction-only mode isn't even exposed in the WDL), but we can probably mention it in the release notes.

Related code (e.g., GCBiasCorrector) is mostly ported and does not have to be closely re-reviewed. I naively introduced RecordCollection and LocatableCollection classes that are analogous to SampleRecordCollection and SampleLocatableCollection, respectively, for collections that are not tied to a sample (e.g., GC-content annotations); we can go back and refactor these classes later.; -SVDDenoisingUtils contains many package-private helper methods for filtering and denoising without unit tests. This is intentional. I have verified that this code exactly reproduces the old PoN results down to the 1E-16 level (with the discrepancy coming from the removal of redundant pseudoinverse operations).

Testability,"Fixes a bug that I inadvertently introduced long ago in #5408. A method there originally assumed that the intervals to be filtered coincide with the annotated intervals when filtering on annotations, but this assumption can be violated when e.g. using `-XL` to further exclude intervals. This breaks the annotation-based filtering and will result in incorrectly retained/dropped intervals. Unfortunately, the integration test cases were not quite complete enough to catch this. Fortunately, for typical data and parameters, the number of affected intervals is typically a very small percentage, especially in human (e.g., the default GC filters of [0.1, 0.9] affect <0.1% of 250bp bins); I only caught this when running on malaria data, since GC filtering has more impact there. I would also expect count-based filters to mitigate some of the effects (e.g., a bin with extreme GC that was erroneously retained when filtering on annotations might later be filtered because it has poor coverage). Downstream results are also all correct---they're just given for a slightly different set of intervals than would be expected. This bug would affect users that made use of the `blacklist_intervals_for_filter_intervals` option in the gCNV WDLs, but my feeling is this functionality is not used that frequently. @droazen I think this is a relatively minor bug, but it might be good to mention it in the release notes.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7046:421,test,test,421,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7046,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Fixes https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2865. To match GATK without sacrificing performance for existing GenotypeGVCF modes, this adds a new traversal type `VariantWalkerGroupedByLocus` which can process variants one-at-a-time, or optionally grouped by Locus. GenotypeGVCFs itself then has to further filter the variants to emulate the ""prioritize start location"" behavior in GATK3. If we keep this traversal, I'll add some unit tests, and we should find a better name. In order to match GATK3 output for sites where the only alt allele is a spanning deletion, I had to use `OutputMode.EMIT_ALL_SITES` when emitting nonvariant sites only (GATK3 uses `OutputMode.EMIT_ALL_CONFIDENT_SITES` in that case).

Is there any way to allow comma in filepath or do I have to avoid using them?. @mack812 ; I tested MDSpark with an unsorted SAM file as input and you are right, it works and the output is a sorted BAM file. So I can skip the SortSam tool wich will save me about 15-20 min in processing time. So MDSpark in total is faster than SortSam+MD +Indexing. ; Thanks for that hint!.

Testability,"For a quick analysis, I made a serialized versions of DBSNP (13572728 variants from `dbsnp_135.b37.excluding_sites_after_129.vcf`), size of VCF on disk 2175071049 bytes (2.0G). (all false postive probs are predicted, it'd be easy to measure it too). Map keys are contig names. ```; Map of String->BloomFilter with 0.001 false positive prob = 27320529 bytes (26M); Map of String->BloomFilter with 0.0004 false positive prob = 30943001 bytes (30M); Map of String->BloomFilter with 0.0001 false positive prob = 36423625 bytes (35M); Map of String->BloomFilter with 0.00004 false positive prob = 40046089 bytes (38M); Map of String->BloomFilter with 0.00001 false positive prob = 45526681 bytes (43M); Map of String->BloomFilter with 0.000001 false positive prob = 54629745 bytes (52M); Map of String->int[] of positions = 60790452 bytes (58M); List<GATKVariant> made just like the one in spark BQSR = 366463957 bytes (349M); ```. Variants from dbSNP cover 0.004 of the genome (15195436 bases of 3101804739) so if we want reasonable precision (number of false positives over all reported hits), say 0.9 precision (of 10 hits only 1 can be false) we need (1-0.9) x 0.004 false positive prob = 0.0004. For 0.99 precision (of 100 hits only 1 can be false) we need (1-0.99) x 0.004 false postive prob = 0.00004. These are approximations of course. Given these numbers, I conclude that, for now, exploring BloomFilters does not seem to make sense (too little saving and too many complications with using a probabilistic data structure - eg we'd need to use it too for the walker BQSR). It does make sense however to explore alternatives to the list of GATKVariants because it's very big when serialized (maybe Kryo does a better job but it's still a big object). A simple alternative like sorted int[] may be sufficient and has attractive properties (trivial to implement and understand, O(log) lookups, 0% false positives, small size when serialized).",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1407#issuecomment-203727133:1881,log,log,1881,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1407#issuecomment-203727133,1,['log'],['log']

Testability,"For reporting the number of reads that fails each of the filters, the composed filter could be changed by a `CountingReadFilter`; using the `getSummaryLine()` method will provide the number of reads failing each of the components. Developers could have in their tools a field with the `WellFormedReadFilter` and call a new method for reporting the summary, to log a warning/debug line. For exploding depending on the tool, maybe an advance/hidden argument can be added to the filter (something like `--failOnMalformed`) to throw an exception if true; developers might add a default filter with this value equals to true if they want to enforce by default this behaviour.

Testability,"From @cmnbroad:. The write side for non-coordinate sorted CRAMs works now, but there is still a problem with reading queryname sorted input crams with unmapped reads. There is an existing test in GATK for this case that is already enabled and has been passing, but only because there is another bug in the test code that is masking the failure because it uses the value ""outputExtension"", which results in a BAM file being created. When I went to fix that as part of re-enabling the disabled CRAM tests, the verification of the queryname test output now fails. The test itself runs, but the samsEqualStringent verification fails reading the output. So the write-side issues with the presorted flag are fixed with samtools/htsjdk#368, but there is still a limitation in htsjdk for reading crams with unmapped reads that are not coordinate sorted that we need to fix/understand.

Testability,"From @tomwhite:. What we can do though is take another look at why we need such a small split size and see if we can increase it (by better tuning etc). Even if we can't we know that some for some classes of jobs (e.g. metrics) we can use the default split size without an issue, so we could add logic to choose an appropriate split size based on the type of job. Thinking about this a bit more, we're actually quite close to a solution. In the existing Spark Mark Duplicates implementation, for example, you can set the parallelism (with -P). By default it is the same as the number of input partitions, but if the partitions are too large then each reducer has too much data to deal with and the job fails. This is why we made the number of partitions large by reducing the split size to 10MB. However, by increasing the number of reducers (by setting -P to be input data size/10MB), the input split size can be increased to its default of 128MB without causing a problem. So I think the work here is to work out a good set of defaults and the smallest number of knobs to override them. For example, I think we could always use the default split size, have some heuristics to choose a good value for the parallelism, and allow it to be overridden with -P. We should also decouple the parallelism and whether the output is a single file. For ReadsPipelineSpark we have -shardedOutput, but not for MarkDuplicatesSpark (where it's signalled by -P 1), so we should make this consistent.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1403:296,log,logic,296,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1403,1,['log'],['logic']

Testability,"From an analysis by @jean-philippe-martin:. **The Problem**. Doing a preliminary performance analysis of Hellbender, I found that ReadBAM did not scale with the number of workers. ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/798637/8913030/757d9552-3464-11e5-8244-46931fed8383.png). Logs indicated it was running on a single worker, regardless of how many were specified for the job. **The Cause**. The underlying cause is a combination of ReadBAM's design and Dataflow's own perhaps over-eager optimization. ReadBAM is implemented as a series of transforms. It could also have been implemented as a Dataflow BoundedSource, but the latter is much more complicated. The transforms are as follows:; Start with a collection of filenames and a collection of contigs.; Transform 1 -- input: filenames, side input: contigs. Generates a list of regions to read (""BAMShard""); Transform 2 -- input: `PCollection<BAMShard>`, output: `PCollection<Read>`. Each worker reads from the BAM file, using the index to find where to read from. Dataflow sees that transform 2 takes as input transform 1's output, and so these two can be run in sequence on the same machines, skipping a serialization/deserialization step. This optimization is called ""fusing"" and it's generally a very good thing. However in this case, the input PCollection has a single element (the file we want to read), so only one worker is involved. Because of the fusion, that same worker then ends up doing all of the reading work, ruining our day. **The Solutions**. There are multiple ways to solve this problem. ; 1. change transform 1 to have the contig collection as a primary input in the hope that we always have more than one contig. ; This solution's very brittle (our benchmark, for example, reads a single chromosome so the contig list has effectively only one element). I did not pursue it.; 2. Insert a groupby step between the two transforms.; pro: this gets all the workers involved again; con: the groupby itself takes some ",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/756:290,Log,Logs,290,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/756,1,['Log'],['Logs']

Testability,"From what I have heard from Dmitriy, this loss in Mutect2 precision between Mutect2 v.4.1.8.1. and v.4.1.9.0 seems to be perfectly reproducible using default parameters on the HCC1395 somatic benchmark gold-standard from the [Sequencing Quality Control Phase II Consortium](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Somatic+Mutation+Working+Group+of+Sequencing+Quality+Control+Phase+II+Consortium%5BCorporate+Author%5D). The drop in performance seems to still persist in the current Mutect2 version. If true, then this could have dramatic affects on Mutect2 clinical variant calling quality since v.4.1.9.0 until now. It would appear that isolating the root cause of this drop in performance has high importance for maintaining the clinical validity of Mutect2. It seems quite a number of Mutect2 code details have [changed between v.4.1.8.1. and v.4.1.9.0](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/compare/4.1.8.1...4.1.9.0), as for instance [this commit concerning quality filtering](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/a304725a60f5000ec6381040137043a557fc3dc1), or [this one concerning soft-clipped bases](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/4982c2fa60e89f699a81150116d058aeac2f7573). Perhaps the circumstance of the drop in precision affecting WES but not WGS data may point to the culprit?. Also, may I ask whether the GATK team is doing real-world regression test on gold-standard variant callsets between version releases, and have these tests passed between v.4.1.8.1. and v.4.1.9.0?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1169735509:192,benchmark,benchmark,192,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7921#issuecomment-1169735509,3,"['benchmark', 'test']","['benchmark', 'test', 'tests']"

Testability,"Funcotator needs a way to read in a locatable XSV but also have it match alleles before adding an annotation (in the same way that VCF data sources require matching alleles). This would allow transformation of large VCF data sources (such as gnomAD) into more easily compressed and read XSV files. . After implementation this needs to be benchmarked for gnomAD 2.1 Alelle Frequency VCFs and if the XSVs are faster, the VCFs should be transformed into XSV files and uploaded to the Funcotator data source bucket. The current speed of gnomAD annotation on the canonical hg19 file is ~2500 variants / minute after the first couple of minutes.

Testability,"GVCF` mode in HaplotypeCaller we merge adjacent regions with similar `GQ` scores but within those merged reference blocks we track the DP (mean dp) and the MIN_DP. When we go to genotype in GenotypeGVCFs we fall back to Min_DP when reporting the DP since it must be at least that high at the sight in question. For Diploid samples and with the default reference blocking we use, this works fine and for most of the range up to 30+ bases you are able to recover a pretty close approximation of what your DP is in most cases. However for Haploid data the assumptions at play mean that the `GQ` gets very high and starts to max out the field (99) so you end up with extremely long reference confidence blocks with very high confidence and a min_DP of some low value (in your case for the data you shared with us of 4, which is the threshold for hitting GQ=90 in the haploid model). This is also part of why adjusting the intervals for traversal was relevant, as if they were too long they were pulling in bases 1000+ bp away that only have 4fold coverage with reads and torpedoing the reported DP. So far nothing seems to obviously be bugged (we don't test/use haploid calling mode very often so its less well tested and this sort of issue is not surprising). We might be over-confident about reporting `GQ` for haploid reference blocks (though mathematically its sound that you only need a few reference observations to be sure about the ref call). Short of adjusting that model drastically there will always be some threshold where ""after X fold coverage of reads everything is merged into a big adjacent ref block"". Unfortunately with block merging on we never expect the DP to be exact (since it should vary over the block and its expensive to store that information exactly) but the issue is much more pronounced in your haploid sample. . We didn't identify a good fix for this issue on our end but you might as well know that we looked into it and have considered why you are seeing this behavior.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8943#issuecomment-2318660429:1318,test,test,1318,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8943#issuecomment-2318660429,2,['test'],"['test', 'tested']"

The comparator doesn't compare these correctly, and ironically, its the string that gets converted to a double. There also seem to be other problematic type differences between the VCs created from BCF vs. VCF.

In Oncotator the positions reported are off by 1 (they; should be one less) and the base reported is also wrong.; This is now fixed. - Removed some old code that had been taken out of the main codepath. - Fixed a bug in how the gencode reference contexts are created.; - Fixed a bug in how the end points for the gencode annotations are; created. - Ref context field is now consistent for indels.; The reference context will give WINDOW bases before and after the; logical reference allele for a variant. This is NOT the allele in the; input VCF, but rather the allele that actually has changed. For; insertions, the logical allele is the SPACE BETWEEN TWO BASES (and; therefore the resulting string will always be 2xWINDOW bases long).; For deletions, the logical allele is the given ref allele without the; required preceding base. For MNPs the logical allele is the given ref; allele.; Updated some tests and test data to reflect this change. - Added a small HG38 regression test set. - Fixed a boundary bug with codon strings.; Now codon change strings have an alternate (correct) form for insertions; that involve the start codon on the - strand, and the stop codon on the; + strand. This form eliminates any overrun/out of bounds exceptions. - Fixed an issue involving variants that overrun the end of the coding sequence. - Added in additional required files for regression test gencode data source. - Added a helpful script and modified test data set to be correct. - Updated part of Gencode to prepare for fixing the exon boundary issue. - Updated FuncotatorIntegrationTests to use environment-variable paths; more safely. - Updated `FuncotatorUtils::getCod",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5302:3667,log,logical,3667,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/5302,1,['log'],['logical']

Not sure if its the same thing or not; as I said I can run this branch fine. Maybe the dylib works, but not the so ?. There is a seemingly unrelated unit test failure in AlleleFrequencyCalculatorUnitTest, which I'll look at.

Testability,"Given the pending merging of #5913 and the issue #19 there are still a number of improvements that need to be made to the DepthOfCoverage for it to be considered a non-beta tool. In the future we may want to pull each of these issues into its own ticket but for now this list will live on in one place. We may choose to only implement some of these features, but we should complete whichever ones we want from this list before we take the tool out of Beta. Here is a compiled list of some of the things we would want to fix so that we don't forget:; - [ ] Added support for outputting RTables (which GATK3 supported); - [ ] Add support for fragment based DepthofCovarge (GATK3 feature). New Features that were requested:. - [ ] **Priority** Port the DiagnoseTargets tool logic in order to attach evaluations ( PASS, COVERAGE_GAPS, LOW_COVERAGE) to the output of this DepthOfCoverage tool. This was one of the requested new features and the primary blocker would be deciding which output table it is most prudently applied to (if not all of them).; - [ ] **Priority** Decide on a new format for inputting gene lists other than the `.refseq` format. There are more standard formats for inputting gene lists that would need support besides this feature. ; - [ ] Think about allowing gene coverage metrics to be reported on a per-transcript basis (This might already be done given that overlapping genes are already handled correctly by the new tool but somebody should evaluate that the results are satisfactory) ; - [ ] Evaluate gene list overlap with traversal lists. Currently if any bases of a gene in the gene list are covered by the traversal intervals then it gets included for whatever bases there are, perhaps adding an option restrict to only completely covered genes would be useful. ; - [ ] Add functionality for partitioning based on read filtering status given a provided list of partitioning read filters.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6491:771,log,logic,771,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6491,1,['log'],['logic']

We resort to hard coding common side outputs that are likely to show up and mark them for deletion in case we happen to produce one of them... I wonder if it is indeed possible to flag a directory for deletion and if we cant improve that method by secretly putting the file you ask for into a delete-on-exit folder so we don't have to guess about indexes and side outputs (that frankly don't look complete?

Testability,"HaplotypeCaller and Mutect2:. ![screen shot 2018-05-30 at 2 36 58 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8438890/40759148-b860a5da-645e-11e8-8f94-21534ed9ab48.png). Notice how all of the reads that appear to support a single-base deletion actually do not because they do not span the poly-T homopolymer. This makes the bamout harder to interpret. In this particular case (of a false positive M2 insertion) it is a red herring because it suggests that the multiallelicness of the site is relevant to the false positive deletion. One could ask what in the GATK engine is responsible. * The assembly engine, perhaps? No, it is the assembly engine's job to propose possible haplotypes, not to call them. In any case, there *is* one spanning read with the deletion above the reads shown, so it is a valid path in the graph.; * Pair-HMM? This one confused me for a while, but no. The engine is *not* saying that these reads' best alignment to the reference has a deletion, which would be false because there is a gap opening penalty. Rather, it says that they align equally well (with no deletions) to the ref haplotype and to the deletion haplotype. The deletion shown in IGV is the deletion of the alt haplotype relative to the reference, not of the reads relative to their best haplotype.; * The bamout writer? Nope, that code is really straightforward and does the right thing. So what's the issue? Well, the bamout writer gets its read alignments from the `readLikelihoods` after the reads have been realigned to their best haplotype. In these cases, it turns out that the alignment of the reads to their best haplotype, the deletion has a log likelihood better than the alignment to the ref haplotype by about 0.00001. The simplest solution would be to give an extremely modest prior in favor of the reference and break these near-ties in favor of the reference. @droazen @ldgauthier @yfarjoun if you think this is a good idea I can fix it for both HC and M2. Otherwise I'll do an M2-only fix.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4829:1696,log,log,1696,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4829,1,['log'],['log']

Testability,"Hello there,. ## Documentation request. It would be awesome if each major/minor release of GATK contained benchmarking results run against a truth set. For calling short germline variants, you could evaluate precision and recall using one of the NIST samples (i.e. HG002) and for calling short somatic variants you could use the SEQC2 tumor-normal pair. . I would like to see how new releases of GATK and how your recommendations/best practices impact precision and recall against a known truth set. This transparency would help anyone using your tools decide if it's worth upgrading to a new release of GATK, or if their implementation of your recommended set of best practices is performing as expected. . If this information could be added to the best practices pages, a relevant tutorial, or a new section of the documentation (containing hap.py/som.py benchmarking information and run times for a set of tested tools and/or workflows), that would be great!.

Testability,"Hello,. GenomicsDB developer here - I'm not super familiar with SLURM...can you tell if your job was actually terminated or was that just a warning of sorts? Can you use `saact` command to find the memory usage of the job? Do your logs tell you how many batches have made progress before you see the error above?. Also, is this difference intentional or...?; > #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=**100G**; vs; > --java-options ""-Xmx190g -**Xms190g**"". Lastly, you could try reducing the batch size down (let's say something like 10, just to see if it makes the error go away) or splitting up into smaller intervals than chromosomes (say, split into intervals of size 50 million) and see if that makes a difference. The idea with each of these is to lower memory usage. Edit: One more thing @nalinigans reminded me of - you could potentially be allocating too much for java here. Again, not super familiar with SLURM so not sure how much this job is getting overall vs how much is being given to Java. GenomicsDB has a core C++ component that does a lot of heavy lifting for us. If you've allocated all/most of the memory available to the job to Java, then the C++ side might be getting starved or causing the job to go over limits. Try reducing what you've set for `--java-options` to make sure there is some memory left for the C++ parts.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6321#issuecomment-566194913:231,log,logs,231,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6321#issuecomment-566194913,1,['log'],['logs']
Testability,"Hello,. I think we're pretty close on porting this. However, i wanted to ask again if I could get access to the test data used in GATK3 VariantEvalWalkerUnitTest and VariantEvalIntegrationTest. We dont need to port those files to GATK4 unless some of them already exist; however, having these files would help confirm the ported tool is behaving exactly as GATK3. Second, I am hoping to confirm a behavior for FeaureContext: many GATK3 stratifiers follow roughly this pattern (VariantEval / knownCNVsFile being an example). The pattern is: 1) some VCF/BED file provided as an argument, 2) in initialize(), the walker reads this file in memory into a List<GenomeLoc> or IntervalTree<GenomeLoc>. This is so each locus can quickly find overlapping intervals. In GATK4, there is no longer a point in loading the whole file into memory, right? If I define an argument as FeatureInput<Feature>, it will automatically be initialized. FeatureContext.getValues() seems to give me overlapping intervals (including partial overlaps). Therefore there is no reason to try to replicate that GATK3 pattern of reading intervals into memory. Can someone confirm this is correct?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/616#issuecomment-343563884:112,test,test,112,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/616#issuecomment-343563884,1,['test'],['test']

Testability,"Hello.; I am not sure if this is a bug or simply a tool version problem but when running the tests with `./gradlew test` I get 18 failures with the `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.tools.walkers.variantutils.LeftAlignAndTrimVariantsUnitTest` class. I wanted to make sure GATK was working right when compiled it from source to have a working base a I intend to try out some experimental modifications to the code. ## Bug Report. ### Affected tool(s) or class(es); `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.tools.walkers.variantutils.LeftAlignAndTrimVariantsUnitTest`. ### Affected version(s); - [ ] Latest public release version [version?]; - [x] Latest master branch as of [11.12.18]. ### Description; The following commands were used to build and test GATK; ```; git pull; ./gradlew clean; ./gradlew bundle; ./gradlew test; ```; The tests resulted in 18 failed as can be seen in the attached file. ; [Test results - Class org.broadinstitute.hellbender.tools.walkers.variantutils.LeftAlignAndTrimVariantsUnitTest.html.zip](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/files/2667609/Test.results.-.Class.org.broadinstitute.hellbender.tools.walkers.variantutils.LeftAlignAndTrimVariantsUnitTest.html.zip).

Testability,"Here's a prototype showing one way of doing this: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/3cf7f9078b6aedcb87a4ca77c2aa8e84e7e5fe99. The idea is that `GATKTool` has a `-spark` flag, so you can run a tool in Spark mode. The parallel `GATKSparkTool` hierarchy would disappear, and tool writers would optionally be able to support Spark as an alternative to the regular walker, by providing the relevant code in the same tool class. As an example, the `FlagStat` implementation looks like this:. ``` java; @Override; public void traverse() {; if (sparkArgs.useSpark) {; sum = getReadsRdd().aggregate(new FlagStatus(), FlagStatus::add, FlagStatus::merge);; } else {; sum = getReadsStream().collect(FlagStatus::new, FlagStatus::add, FlagStatus::merge);; }; }; ```. Note that the walker version uses the Java 8 Streams API, while the Spark version uses the RDD API. While these are different APIs, many of the concepts are similar, so it should be possible to share the underlying logic by encapsulating it in classes, in much the same way as is done by the `FlagStatus` class for `FlagStat`. It would also be possible to keep the existing `apply` method for walker versions of tools that simply iterate over each record. Removing the parallel `GATKSparkTool` hierarchy has a number of benefits, such as reducing duplication, making it easier for tool writers to add Spark support, and making it easier to share tests.

Testability,"Here's the work I've done so far to implement an overlaps partitioner: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/compare/tw_overlap_partitioner. The idea is to coalesce neighbouring partitions so that the task processing them can see (but not process) reads from neighbouring partitions. E.g. the task processing partition _i_ can see reads from partition _i-1_ and partition _i+1_. This is done using Spark 2's _coalesce_ method that takes a PartitionCoalescer: http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/org/apache/spark/rdd/RDD.html#coalesce(int,%20boolean,%20scala.Option,%20scala.math.Ordering). In this PR I backported some of that logic so it works with Spark 1.6. It turns out that this is not faster than the groupByKey, primarily since it has to scan over the input twice: first to find the extents of the reads in each partition, second to process each (coalesced) partition. It should be possible to avoid the first scan by just reading the first read in each partition and using a sequence dictionary to find the end points of contigs. This is a bit more involved, although it should be faster than groupByKey.

Testability,"Here's what this PR does:. * Adds an argument to skip a locus rather than downsample if depth is too high. This handles horrible regions so rife with mapping errors that we wouldn't believe any calls from them. Basically, it blacklists on the fly intervals that should have been blacklisted ahead of time.; * Adds a stride argument for positional downsampling so that we downsample within a range of alignment start positions. This regularizes statistical fluctuations in coverage and, more importantly, makes positional downsampling much more useful for data where many reads share the same start position while most start positions have no reads. I believe @fleharty deals with this kind of stuff.; * ~~Deletes a few methods in the `ReadsDownsampler` API that were only used in their own unit tests.~~; * Adds an option to bias downsampling in favor of reads with high mapping quality.; * Beefs up the unit tests for `PositionalDownsampler`.

Testability,"Hey @davidbenjamin,. just a heads-up that we have generated some additional inights on this issue that relate to the effects of sample prep on false-positive rates under the changed error model. In short, it seems as if the error model is now much more (perhaps overly?) sensitive to sample-prep noise typical in real-world clinical sequencing data, leading to a 2-3x increase of false-positives in such WES (and, assuming, also other high-coverage) samples. This may have been an undesired side effect of overfitting the error model to the synthetic (and thus much cleaner) DREAM3 benchmark two years ago.

This has the benefit of not requiring client code to put `throws IOException` (or catch the `IOException`) everywhere, and is more consistent with the rest of the codebase, which typically traps checked exceptions as early as possible and wraps them in unchecked exceptions (either `UserException` or `GATKException`, depending on whether it's likely to be the user's fault or not).

Testability,"Hi @LiviaMoura ,. The dropped allele is expected behavior. One of the ways reblocking speeds up joint genotyping is by dropping information associated with alleles that are not in the most likely genotype. The subsequent alleles are not left aligned because the position doesn't change. Instead they are trimmed so that they use the minimal representation. Historically the FORMAT DP doesn't change when alleles are dropped (as in subsetting more than 5 alternate alleles in the previous pipeline). Given that this is a GVCF with a <NON_REF> allele, the most correct thing to do would be to move that 1 read associated with the dropped allele to the <NON_REF> AD so that the sum of the AD values are still equal to the FORMAT DP, but the NON-REF AD values will get dropped in the joint genotyping step anyway, so the change would only be reflected in the intermediate GVCF files. The DRAGEN data I had been working with didn't have allele fraction, but we also came across this issue independently. I made a fix and we're testing it now. If it looks good, I'll generalize it to use the header information rather than special casing particular annotations. I can put in some code to subset the posteriors as well.

Direct intervention and changing this code breaks certain unit tests which result in failure to build our conda and docker environments. This is a works in progress for our newer conda and docker environment however for the time being you may manually edit your R scripts to solve it or use R from our conda or docker environments to generate images.

Testability,"Hi @Neato-Nick @davidbenjamin . Apologies for posting this message here. I have posted this message few days before at the regular GATK forum and also using the direct inbox option but have got no response so maybe something wrong with my account. The issue is - I have done variant calling on 384 potato samples following, mostly, GATK best ##practices and have applied hard filters to select SNPs for further usage. However, I am noticing that '--max-nocall-fraction', '--max-nocall-number' and '--max-fraction-filtered-genotypes' arguments for 'SelectVariants' are not working properly. I have tried with various cutoff settings and every time I am observing SNPs with a much larger number of genotypes (~246 out of 384 with 0.10 setting) with 'no call' than the set thresholds. I have searched the forum first but couldn't find any relevant threads. I am using the latest GATK version (4.0.7.0). I am attaching three example sets of (1) log files (2) subset vcf files and (3) vcf index file for the three main vcfs. I would appreciate if you could provide any feedback on this issue and/or if this behaviour has been observed by some other users also.

Testability,Hi @RWilton i'm sorry to hear that. I suspect its unrelated given how simple this PR is but its quite possible that filter has been broken since evidently nobody was able to use and adjust it for a long time. This is the logic here that the filter uses:; `return read.isPaired() && !read.isUnmapped() && !read.mateIsUnmapped() &&; (Math.abs(read.getStart() - read.getMateStart()) >= mateTooDistantLength || !read.getContig().equals(read.getMateContig()));`. That logic is correct for what the filter is doing. It should be noted that the filter does the opposite of what you expect it to (since its intended for our SV pipeline) in that it filters out all reads that are NOT having distant mates. This means if you try to run HaplotypeCaller with this setting you will be throwing away every read pair EXCEPT the distant ones which results in mostly no reads. We should perhaps rename this filter to be a little less confusing.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7701#issuecomment-1103010098:221,log,logic,221,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7701#issuecomment-1103010098,2,['log'],['logic']

Testability,"Hi @geetduggal. Thanks for the very complete error report! I'm sorry you're running into these errors. We're aware of similar problems and fixing them is a very high priority. It looks like you're running use the tagged alpha version. I might try using the most version. Pull request #1433 should hopefully fix the problem your seeing in your third example, which I believe is likely caused by the same issue as in #1324.

Testability,"Hi @jean-philippe-martin ,. A `Feature` in our codebase has a specific meaning that is different from ""interval"": it is a record that 1. has a location on the genome plus (typically) some metadata information about that location and 2. is in one of the formats supported by our file-parsing framework tribble and is the product of a tribble codec. A VCF record is an example of a `Feature`. . The common interface between `Feature` and `SimpleInterval` is called `Locatable`. I recommend (for now) that you simply alter your uprooted version of BQSR to take a `List<? extends Locatable>` instead of a `List<? extends Feature>` in `apply()`. This should require no code changes beyond changing method parameter types, and it will allow you to feed BQSR `SimpleIntervals` for the known sites for now, and `Features` like VCF records later on when we're ready for that.

The inflater in this message is referring to the fact that one of the compressed blocks gets uncompressed with zero output bytes which happens with the very last block of a properly formatted BGZF file (as a your input bam should be). It looks like the issue is an errant message in the GKL intel inflater.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8126#issuecomment-1371196080:103,log,logging,103,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8126#issuecomment-1371196080,1,['log'],['logging']

Testability,"Hi @magicDGS. I went down this same path (composition of CountingFilter) when I originally implemented CountingReadFilter, but I abandoned it for the model we currently have. I think the current model is much simpler in a number of ways. This is an interesting problem, but I would say lets just implement a straight CountingVariantFilter/tests and not try to do the common implementation. . BTW, when looking at this PR I noticed two bugs in the existing code that we should make sure not to propagate to the Variant one (feel free to fix/test these as part of this PR):. - CountingReadFilter.resetFilterCount only resets the root filter count; it needs an override in BinOp to propagate the reset call to the lhs/rhs operands.; - there is a bug in the getSummary tests/code; you can see the fix [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/9ef1458271834aed9b64a5d66f94df33f025eafb).

Testability,"Hi @stefandiederich,. Great that you were able to successfully run GermlineCNVCaller! @asmirnov239 is currently working on a postprocessing tool that will convert the raw generated results into VCFs. @mbabadi is also working on writing some more in-depth documentation on the tool and its probabilistic model. For now, you may be able to parse the raw results on your own. You are probably most interested in the contents of the ""*-calls"" directory. The root of this directory contains the interval list common to all samples; furthermore, each sample has its own subdirectory that contains text files that describe the sample-specific model-parameter posteriors. In particular, the ""log_q_c_tc.tsv"" file contains the log posteriors per copy-number state, with rows corresponding to the intervals in the aforementioned interval list.

Testability,"Hi @tomwhite! The serializer registrations in ADAM shouldn't effect any GATK serialization, unless you're serializing classes from ADAM (such as `org.bdgenomics.format.avro.AlignmentRecord`); additionally, we haven't seen any performance issues with serialization in ADAM 0.23.0 outside of the GATK. We actually made a number of patches to eliminate logging in 0.23.0 (relative to 0.22.0), so I'd doubt that is the culprit. The one exception to this is logging when writing Parquet out to disk, which greatly increased sometime between ADAM 0.21.0 and 0.23.0, due to a change in Parquet versions upstream in Spark. However, this would only impact you if you were writing Parquet, and additionally this issue was resolved with the release of Spark 2.2.0, so you should see the logging go away with #4314. If I had to hypothesize anything, I'd suggest that the 2bit file change is the one thing that could be biting you. That said, we've been running with this 2bit file code quite frequently on AWS and Azure for at least the last 6 months using GATK HC on WES and WGS data and haven't seen any performance issues. I show that the changes in the 2bit file code between ADAM 0.20.0 and 0.23.0 are API compatible, so if you check out ADAM 0.23.0 and then `git checkout adam-parent-spark2_2.11-0.20.0 adam-core/src/main/scala/org/bdgenomics/adam/util/TwoBitFile.scala` and build the ADAM JAR (and then package that jar into GATK), you should be able to test that hypothesis.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4376#issuecomment-366308897:350,log,logging,350,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/4376#issuecomment-366308897,4,"['log', 'test']","['logging', 'test']"

Testability,"Hi Adam,. I've reformatted the code and fixed some issues you raised in the first review.; Specifically:; 1. Default values for tool's boolean arguments are changed to false.; 2.

Testability,"Hi Adam,. Thank you for this amazing work, and would like to suggest something small without disturbing the test-flow. So unless I'm not mistaken, the class that is consuming the memory is [NestedIntegerArray.java](https://github.com/broadgsa/gatk/blob/master/public/gatk-utils/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/gatk/utils/collections/NestedIntegerArray.java). Why not try an experiment where you implement something similar to [Google's SSTable](https://www.igvita.com/2012/02/06/sstable-and-log-structured-storage-leveldb/) that got release as [leveldb](https://github.com/google/leveldb). For instance the key-index lookup for you can be hash or a hash+offset. Basically these structures borrow from the concept of a [Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree) - link is a PDF paper](http://paperhub.s3.amazonaws.com/18e91eb4db2114a06ea614f0384f2784.pdf). You can push most of these to disk instead of memory, and they can be compressed as well. The indices can remain in memory for fast-lookup with the data staying on disk. So for instance, you can generate an key-index digest of specific values via `hash_function(numReadGroups.id, qualDimension.index, eventDimension.type)`, whose result you then use to quickly lookup the value for that key - which would reside on disk. That can be further improved with a priority queue cache for the most accessed values.

Testability,"Hi Marissa - I think we're all in agreement that we'd like to find a way to make Intel-TF the default, but whether or not we can have CNNScoreVariants require AVX to run is less clear. Naturally, we'd prefer to not have to provide a custom TF distribution for a fallback, but there are 3 cases where we may not have a choice: user with old hardware, Travis/CI testing, and GCE. We may need to provide a fallback environment for those (I'll try to get resolution on that). If it turns out we do, I'm actually not suggesting the fallback be automatic (3 in your list), just that we have a graceful failure mode and an instructive error message. .

It looks like it produces so much output building the Docker image that it exceeds the allowable Travis build log size.

Testability,"Hi [cademirch](https://github.com/cademirch),. I believe the tool is working as intended in this case. The tool in this mode is designed to balance interval lists evenly by the amount of genomic territory covered, without splitting any individual interval. The documentation for `BALANCING_WITHOUT_INTERVAL_SUBDIVISION` mode mentions this:. ""Scatter the interval list into similarly sized interval lists (**_by base count_**), but without breaking up intervals."". Since the tool is not allowed to split individual intervals in this mode, it may use the number of bases in the largest interval (`test:160-220` in your toy example) as the target number of bases per file:. ""The ""target width"" of each scatter list may be wider than what is computed for INTERVAL_SUBDIVISION. Specifically, if the widest interval in the source interval list is larger than what would otherwise be the target width, that interval's width is used."". This likely explains why you're only getting 3 files -- the tool is trying to ensure that each file covers ~60 bases. If you just want to divide by number of intervals, rather than base count, you should be using `INTERVAL_COUNT` mode instead.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8315#issuecomment-1548452133:595,test,test,595,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8315#issuecomment-1548452133,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"Hi again, some updates! I've updated our PED with inferred rather than stated sex, which has resolved a number of these issues. As stated before, the samples which had incorrectly assigned sexes were not the named samples appearing the error logs, which made troubleshooting a challenge. . We're now running into issues with true sex aneuploidy, which the tool doesn't work for, as stated in [your docs page](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/9570468120987-JointGermlineCNVSegmentation-BETA). Do you have a way to cleanly handle these sex aneuploidies so that we can retain calls for the rest of the genome, rather than excluding the sample(s) entirely?

Testability,Hi all -- I have recently started observing this exact issue with PrintReads. I have been using this via cromwell jobs in Terra and on Saturday this issue cropped up. I was able to recreate it locally by launching the latest GATK Docker image (4.2.5.0) and running `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud auth application-default login`. Similar to @ldgauthier adding `export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=` does nothing locally. Did this ever get resolved?

Testability,"Hi all, thanks again for working to integrate this code!. Saw some confusion in the comments above and just wanted to clarify: if you take a look at the VQSR-lite PR https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/7954/commits that the current branch is rebased upon, you'll see that it contains a version of the Joint Genotyping WDL (which was put together by Megan for Ultima) along with Java code for the tools (which was written by me). Both the WDL and the code have been updated in subsequent PRs. The WDL was rewritten by me in #8074; the main difference is that we no longer run SNPs and indels filtering in ""series"", but instead run them in a single step. However, this requires that you use the same annotations for both SNPs and indels; GVS might not be ready for that just yet, since the default WARP implementation uses different annotations. (But see also the comment here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8074#issue-1423991277. The gist is we can easily reimplement Megan's/WARP's ""serial"" SNP-then-indel workflow using the simpler single-step workflow.) (EDIT: I was originally confused here, Megan’s WDL simply runs SNPs and indels separately—thanks to George for correcting me here!). Note also that test infrastructure was moved from Travis to Github Actions between these PRs, so the Travis references above have already been cleaned up. There have also been a few additional minor PRs merged in the interim, with a couple more incoming. These PRs do not fundamentally change the interfaces of the tools/WDL, however, so I think you can update to them when you're ready. Punchline: this branch should suffice for a first cut of a VQSR/VQSR-lite bakeoff, and although it is already slightly out of date, it shouldn't be too much work to get things updated after the first cut is done.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8157#issuecomment-1412640649:1226,test,test,1226,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8157#issuecomment-1412640649,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"Hi all.; This looks like an issue presented by a forum post . [Haplotypecaller FORMAT:DP is affected by the interval in WGS](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/community/posts/27992393649051-Haplotypecaller-FORMAT-DP-is-affected-by-the-interval-in-WGS). User uploaded a toy data for us to test and I was able to recreate this issue under GATK 4.6.0.0. I have not tested it with any other versions. When whole contig is given as interval all variant sites in the multisample VCF is reported with DP value much less than what it is supposed to be in samples where no variation occur. Samples with variants are shown as expected DP. Setting ploidy 2 for this analysis restores the expected DP value for samples with HOMREF sites no matter what interval is used. Numbers can be seen in the figure as well as those variant contexts. .

Testability,"Hi folks. @chandrans and I have laid out some plans towards updating GATK4 docs for the January 9 release. Our approach is to prioritize documentation around stable Best Practice Workflows. On the docket currently is the single stable workflow--germline SNP and indel calling from DNA data. We will of course update tool docs (excluding Spark and BWA tools) and supporting tutorials. Even for tools we are unfamiliar with, we aim to have at the least a basic description and an example command. Thanks for the documentation you have already done and the help you give us in updating these. If you are certain your workflow will be ready for the release, then please let us know immediately so we can plan accordingly. If your workflow will be ready later, then can you still give us an estimate for your release so we can plan ahead? Thanks. - @davidbenjamin, did I hear you correctly that you think somatic SNV and indel calling will be ready for the Jan 9 release?; - @samuelklee, I know major changes are currently afoot for somatic CNV.

What about WGS?; - @mbabadi, is March, 2018 still the plan?; - @jonn-smith, what is the status on the Tool-That-Must-Not-Be-Named?; - @cwhelan @tedsharpe @SHuang-Broad, is SV on for next year or thereafter?.

Testability,"Hi, regarding making --linked-de-bruijn-graph the default, I wanted to share that I had recently run mutect2 (gatkv4.2.6.1) on a larger cohort of samples with that option, some of which had variant calls from a previous mutect2 run (gatkv4.1.0.0) without this option. I noticed that plenty of known cancer drivers (e.g. KRAS p.G12C or PIK3CA p.E545* or BRAF p.V600*) that were present in a substantial number of samples (>10%ish) in the old calls were completely absent in the new calls. I had to add the option --recover-all-dangling-branches to recover those known hotspot mutations. They also all have very sufficient coverage (O(100)x) and high VAF to make them obvious true positives.

Testability,"Hi,. I am trying to call common and rare germline copy number variants with GATK 4, for more than 100 human samples based on human genome reference: hg19. For this project, I have 500 GB for memory, 10 TB for storage and 300 cpu cores. The program version is as below:. GATK Version: 4.1.2.0; Openjdk Version: 1.8.0_232; Python Version: 3.6.8. I didn't use the WDL way. I just follow the document of Notebook#11684 and build a local pipeline. I split the my project based on Chromosome, including (chr1, chr2, chr3, chr4, chr5, chr6, chr7, chr8, chr9, chr10, chr11, chr12, chr13, chr14, chr15, chr16, chr17, chr18, chr19, chr20, chr21, chr22, chrX, chrY, chrMT). After finish the pipeline, I am testing it with 6 samples. When I separately submit my script for each chromosome, every sub-project goes well: through my Input BAM Files, I can get the corresponding VCF Files (10 cores and 10 GB for each single project). That is to say, the environment of our GATK and Python for germline copy number variants calling should be OK.

Testability,"Hmm, actually, could this be a problem due to the way the native libraries are loaded in the test code? Note that we first cycle through all implementations in the DataProvider, loading the respective library for each implementation via the `synchronized boolean load` method in the `NativeLibraryLoader`. I'm not really that familiar with concurrency in Java (nor loading native libraries, for that matter), but it seems that the intermittent failure goes away when I refactor the test to remove the DataProvider (by just looping through the implementations in the test method).

Testability,"Hmm, thanks for suggesting the addition of a regression test @fleharty. This caused me to realize that I actually missed another gap in the previous filtering logic that might have yielded NaNs (resulting from division by zero interval medians) in this particular edge case, which actually takes effect before the rounding error I originally fixed. However, because of how HDF5 writes NaN values as 0, this apparently doesn't lead to any catastrophic failures. We should definitely check that behavior is reasonable in this case (i.e., when interval medians are zero); I've filed #6878. In the end, I added a regression test that only passes with the changes to address the rounding error. This was a bit of a pain because we use simulated data in the tests that cover this code, and the filters are applied in sequential order only on those elements that passed the previous filter. Note that there are many other possible filtering combinations that would be impractical to test. I think that all of this filtering logic was ported over from GATK CNV (I only rewrote the code to perform the filtering in-place to improve memory usage), and I'm not sure that all edge-case behavior was well defined by the original logic (which probably implicitly assumed typical, well formed data, i.e., using more than one sample, without too many uncovered intervals). Fortunately, these edge-case usages (i.e., using a single sample to build the PoN, mistakenly including too many uncovered intervals, and/or disabling various filters) are probably not too common.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6624#issuecomment-705843882:56,test,test,56,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/6624#issuecomment-705843882,7,"['log', 'test']","['logic', 'test', 'tests']"

One of the major points of discussion are the following:. * `Collection` instead of `List`: I think that the first is more flexible, because a client maybe wants to have a `LinkedHashSet` as the argument to avoid repetition of the same filter. I agree that the abstract class should discourage not honoring the user order.; * Access to methods/fields: I think that the plugin could be used outside GATK in a different way by extending it. I explained some of my usage cases in one of the comments in the code, but just by overriding a simple method the whole plugin could be used very nicely in some of them.

Testability,"I bring the first point up given the safeguards our previous workflow had in place. In GATK3, CombineVariants checks that all the sample names are unique. You have to add `--genotypemergeoption UNIQUIFY` to allow use of the same normal sample. In GATK4, CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals allows input of the same sample twice and thereby counts the same evidence in the PoN it generates. Granted, I am doing something intentionally stupid here but I can imagine that this could happen accidentally for situations where we are dealing with hundreds of normal samples. . Interestingly, given the same sample twice, for my test case, it generates a PoN that has one less call than the inputs. Here is the command that runs successfully. Note that 2 is a direct copy of 1 made using unix `cp`.; ```; 	gatk-launch CreateSomaticPanelOfNormals \; 		-vcfs 1_normalforpon.vcf.gz \; 		-vcfs 2_normalforpon.vcf.gz \; 		-O 3_discard_practice_pon.vcf.gz; ```.

I write save some of these outputs and add a test that makes sure they don't change. They look funny though since the VC being passed in aren't very realistic looking and only have the features that are examined by the writer.

Testability,"I can confirm that in my own extensive runs of the tools I've seen it sometimes get hung when out of memory instead of exiting (resulting in bad data for that run). My own benchmarking was with PrintReads on a large file, using various cache buffer sizes. I remember seeing an increase in performance up to about 50MB buffer size and then it flattened out. I would expect a more CPU-intensive (or a more heavily loaded machine) would reduce the impact of the buffer size as I/O ceases to be the bottleneck. I also ran experiments on a 1-cpu machine with VCF and loading a single interval, which I think matches what you are asking about. In that experiment 10MB was enough, adding to the cache did not bring any improvement and of course too large a cache leads to running out of memory.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2640#issuecomment-298972380:172,benchmark,benchmarking,172,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2640#issuecomment-298972380,1,['benchmark'],['benchmarking']

Testability,"I can contribute to this one too if I have time, because I will need it too. My suggestion is to create a plugin for the annotation engine. There are also some issues that will be nice to address/discuss too before I start contributing:. * __Allow custom packages for Annotations in VariantAnnotatorEngine__ (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/2155): I think that `VariantAnnotatorEngine` should be modify directly to use annotation classes and let the plugin deal with the reflection code to pick the instances for each String. This will help in my work trying to use `VariantAnnotatorEngine` with custom annotation classes, and let the package constraint to the plugin itself (and at some point, to the GATK configuration).; * __GenotypeAnnotations require GT, but some of them are computable without them__(https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1730): some of this annotations are useful for my work, which does not include samples with genotypes. Nevertheless, I cannot use them unless I hack my `Genotype` object beforehand. I think that this could be solved by setting a flag in the plugin and set the genotype annotation with it, to allow the computation for non-called samples.; * It would be nice to have in the plugin an argument collection (similar to #2355), allowing other implementations for the arg parsing part. I will appreciate if these things are included/addressed at the same time, and I would love to contribute with some code to help you and be a beta-tester from the API point of view.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1880#issuecomment-288768668:1494,test,tester,1494,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/1880#issuecomment-288768668,1,['test'],['tester']

Testability,"I created a panel of normals from 90 WGS TCGA samples with 250bp (~11.5M) bins, which took **~57 minutes** total and produced an **11GB PoN** (this file includes all of the input read counts---which take up 20GB as a combined TSV file and a whopping 63GB as individual TSV files---as well as the eigenvectors, filtering results, etc.). The run can be found in /dsde/working/slee/wgs-pon-test/tieout/no-gc. It completed successfully with **-Xmx32G** (in comparison, CreatePanelOfNormals crashed after 40 minutes with -Xmx128G). The runtime breakdown was as follows:. - ~45 minutes simply from reading of the 90 TSV read-count files in serial. Hopefully #3349 should greatly speed this up. (In comparison, CombineReadCounts reading 10 files in parallel at a time took ~100 minutes to create the aforementioned 20GB combined TSV file, creating 25+GB of temp files along the way.). - ~5 minutes from the preprocessing and filtering steps. We could probably further optimize some of this code in terms of speed and heap usage. (I had to throw in a call to System.gc() to avoid an OOM with -Xmx32G, which I encountered in my first attempt at the run...). - ~5 minutes from performing the SVD of the post-filtering 8643028 x 86 matrix, maintaining 30 eigensamples. I could write a quick implementation of randomized SVD, which I think could bring this down a bit (the scikit-learn implementation takes <2 minutes on a 10M x 100 matrix), but this can probably wait. Clearly making I/O faster and more space efficient is the highest priority. Luckily it's also low hanging fruit. The 8643028 x 30 matrix of eigenvectors takes <2 minutes to read from HDF5 when the WGS PoN is used in DenoiseReadCounts, which gives us a rough idea of how long it should take to read in the original ~11.5M x 90 counts from HDF5. So once #3349 is in, then I think that a **~15 minute single-core WGS PoN could easily be viable**.

Testability,"I definitely like the idea of moving in this direction, and it will become more compelling as we extend the GATKSparkTool hierarchy, which is currently pretty flat and doesn't mirror the GATKTool hierarchy.

Testability,"I did a simple experiment and changed the version of Java used in the non-Docker (""17"", although again I'm not sure what this actually resolves to) to that used in the Docker (17.0.1+12).

Moreover, the test failures produce exactly the same discrepant numerical results. I think we can probably conclude that the expected test results were generated with ""17"" and that changing to 17.0.1+12 generates different results. This is not too unreasonable; see the Slack thread linked in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/8111#issuecomment-1331407680, for example, which shows that we might be getting into pretty hairy territory and that even changes to things like how HotSpot Intrinsics are implemented in each JVM can cause the numerical differences we see here.

Testability,"I didn't realize before that there is no ""include"" (opt-in) validation type arg, only ""exclude"". So I'm not sure what the purpose of having ""ALL"" is in the first place, if the only thing you can usefully do with it is exclude it. I think the best longer term fix would be to add an ""--validation-type-to-include"" arg, and have it default to the everything except for IDs, and then construct the actual types based on merging include/exclude args. But thats a bigger change then just fixing the current (silent do-nothing) default behavior, and requires more error checking for conflicting args. Lets start with changing it so that in the default (no args) case, we log a warning message saying that IDs will be left out since no IDS were provided, and proceed with the remaining validations. Then if we want to get more ambitious we can talk about making the bigger change. Also, as part of the initial fix, it might be a good idea to change `calculateValidationTypesToApply` so that it doesn't modify the `excludeTypes` list directly, since this is the list provided by the user, and instead uses it's own temporary list.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5862#issuecomment-498685279:665,log,log,665,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/5862#issuecomment-498685279,1,['log'],['log']

Testability,"I had a look at the source code of [HypergeometricDistribution](HypergeometricDistribution). If I am right, we are doing the following. We are invoking `logProbability()` for all possible `x[0][0]`. For a table with large numbers, we have to compute logBinomial for many iterations (see line 202–222 in the HypergeometricDistribution source code). Typically logBinomial calls three logGamma and each logGamma calls `log()` twice. This involves lots of computation and is not the fastest way to implement Fisher's exact test. A faster way to implement the test takes the advantage of two observations. 1) When carrying the test, we are calling hypergeo(i,m+n,m,k), hypergeo(i+1,m+n,m,k), ... in order, and we can derive hypergeo(i+1,m+n,m,k) from hypergeo(i,m+n,m,k) by simply multiplying a number. This will be much faster than doing the full hypergeo->logBionomial->logGamma->log computation for each `i`. 2) For a large table, often when `i` is sufficiently smaller or larger than `x[0][0]`, the hypergeo probability is small enough to be ignored from the sum. It is not necessary to calculate hypergeo for the full range of `lo<=i<hi`. This trick can also dramatically reduce the number of iterations for large tables. htslib has a [exact test implementation](https://github.com/samtools/htslib/blob/bf753361dab9b1640cf64f7886dbfe35357a43c5/kfunc.c#L201) that considers the two observations. I understand that the time spent on the `FisherExactTest` class probably won't show up at all in a profiler. I am not requesting to improve the implementation now. Just let you know the tricks. In addition, when we use this class for other purposes, a fast exact test may become a good thing.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2307#issuecomment-266289212:153,log,logProbability,153,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2307#issuecomment-266289212,14,"['log', 'test']","['log', 'logBinomial', 'logBionomial', 'logGamma', 'logProbability', 'test']"

It's not really ""numerical instability,"" which is a deep and frightening topic, but rather just plain old finite precision, which is not nearly so hydra-headed a problem.; * I learned the general rule for avoiding finite precision problems with a qual score, which is: always calculate probabilities of alleles being absent. Previously I was calculating the probability that samples had an allele and subtracting (in log space) that from 1.

Testability,"I have been running into an issue with Funcotator where some mutations are causing Funcotator to crash because it attempts to query a segment that extends beyond the boundary of the transcript ( see https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6345 ). This pull request addresses the issue by adding a check for transcript length before executing the query. I looked at the code, and Funcotator currently handles problematic sequence queries in `getFivePrimeUtrSequenceFromTranscriptFasta()` by returning an empty string. I modified `getFivePrimeUtrSequenceFromTranscriptFasta()` to also return an empty string when the segment it is trying to retrieve extends beyond the boundary of the transcript. . I have a small VCF that can be used to reproduce the problem using the current code on `master` and the hg38 data source, and I have verified that this pull request allows Funcotator to process the problematic variant without crashing. I did not add the VCF to the tree, but can provide it if that is preferred. Is there any guidance for how to implement integration tests with funcotator? The Funcotator data source I am using is ~12gb, but I would think the problem could be reproduced with 1 transcript and 1 variant.

It can be very useful to know that a lot of reads are lost to a particular filter as an important sanity check for processing but unfortunately that information can be very confusing and not helpful without some indication of the total number of reads that were processed to begin with. I propose that we add to the `CountingReadFilter` code additional logic to keep track of the unfiltered reads as well so we can report both numbers to the user and clear up potential confusion.,MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7944:705,log,logic,705,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/7944,1,['log'],['logic']
Testability,"I have noticed in debugging an issue that there is an inconsistency in the overlaps methods in a somewhat pathological edge case that we should probably address somewhere in the future. In the case where a read (locatable) consumes no reference bases I see inconsistent behavior if the read is ""aligned"" to the last base in a simple interval. To demonstrate I have this read (which is all insertions): ; `<READNAME>	99	chr1	72515809	34	70I81H	=	72515809	70	ATATATGTATACATATATATGTACATATATATGTATACATATATGCACATATATATGTATACATATATAT	....`; and the simple interval: ; `chr1:72515804-72515808`; Calling the method `read.overlaps(simpleInterval)` returns true, whereas calling the method `simpleInterval.overlaps(read)` returns false. Doing a little digging into why this is, it appears that the `.overlaps()` method that gets called in the former case maps to the Locatable overlaps method which calls return `withinDistanceOf(other, 0);` which from what I can tell fails in this case because `<READNAME>.getEnd()` returns `72515808` for this all insertion read. The latter case seems to map to -> `overlapsWithMargin(other, 0);` which doesn't end up getting tripped by the `read.getEnd()` result. . This is a very marginal case and perhaps it is best addressed by making sure we aren't producing meaningless all insertion reads but we should probably add some better tests to the locatable/simpleInterval overlaps methods and change them so they are absolutely concordant in every pathological edge case so this doesn't cause issues for us in the future.",MatchSource.ISSUE,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6898:1361,test,tests,1361,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/6898,1,['test'],['tests']

Testability,"I have tested several program functions by GATK4, some of them work pretty well. GATK4 does a great job to organize all steps by different tools like BWA, samtools, picard. Besides, it seems that there is also some optimization inside. Like ""cleanSam"" step, GATK4 cuts the time half compared to the one using Picard. (From 8 mins to 4 mins on same data) . However, the problem about GATK4 is that some programs fail due to java related problem (Maybe some reasons else). So far, the functions I failed are ""FastqToSam"" and ""ReadsPipelineSpark "". . Note that, I am using spark locally not scale-out cluster. So the command I am running ReadsPipelineSpark is as below(with oracle java8).

Testability,"I have the same problem. The error seems to occur when the number of alleles is exactly one greater than the value of ` --max-alternate-alleles`. Note that is the case in Andrius's output above: it throws a warning, but no error, when there are more than 7 alleles, but when there are exactly 7 alleles (one more than the default max of 6) it errors out. . I have tried this on a number of different chromosomes (small test cases with 4 Chinook salmon) and always get the error immediately after a warning about having 7 alleles. On one chromosome, an earlier warning about 8 alleles causes no error, UNLESS I set `--max-alternate-alleles` to 7, in which case, the position with 8 alleles causes the error immediately after the warning.

Testability,"I noticed a huge amount of ""Jumbo genotype annotations requested but fragment likelihoods or haplotype likelihoods were not given"" logging in some of our pipeline jobs. This patch fixes two things:. 1) I propose GATK only log this message once, the first time it hits this. 2) I think the logic here is wrong. It lacked parenthesis. This logic was:. ```; if (!jumboGenotypeAnnotations.isEmpty() && !fragmentLikelihoods.isPresent() || !haplotypeLikelihoods.isPresent()) {; ```. In java: ""false && false || true"" gives true, which is not what you want. For example, if jumboGenotypeAnnotations was empty, this would still log if either fragmentLikelihoods or haplotypeLikelihoods tests true. That doesnt seem like what you want.

Testability,"I rebased this, and responded to code review comments:. - updated comments; - reverted GenotypeGVCFs change; - reverted changing the default lookahead for VariantWalker side inputs. I think changing the default lookahead for VariantWalker side inputs to the new, smaller value will hurt performance for tools like VQSR. I did some crude timing tests using the FeatureDataSource default (1000 bases) proposed in this branch, and the current default (100,000 bases). The following are total times as reported by Gradle for serial runs of the VQSR integration tests:. With 1000 base lookahead:; 1m40s; 1m29s; 1m29s; 1m25s.

That's what I'm planning on (except that `AssemblyContigAlignmentsConfigPicker` is upstream of this unit), and here's the thought for why:; * I'd try to place the alignment picking step in a single place as much as possible, this makes improvements to the alignment picking/filtering step easier; * the size-based filter can be tuned, even by an CLI argument, this would affect the number of segments in the CPX logic, and the alt_arrangment annotations, and the simple variants re-interpreted by `CpxVariantReInterpreterSpark`, but it won't affect the alt haplotype sequence, which IMO is what really is important. ; * I'm developing a downstream variant filter, which hopefully can cut down the false-positives. And for the question of ""why 2 instead of 1"", I think what you are suggesting is to change; ```java; public static final int MIN_READ_SPAN_AFTER_DEOVERLAP = 2;; if (one.getSizeOnRead() >= MIN_READ_SPAN_AFTER_DEOVERLAP) result.add(one);; ```; to; ```java; public static final int MIN_READ_SPAN_AFTER_DEOVERLAP = 1;; if (one.getSizeOnRead() > MIN_READ_SPAN_AFTER_DEOVERLAP) result.add(one);; ```; Am i right?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4962#issuecomment-405619353:426,log,logic,426,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4962#issuecomment-405619353,1,['log'],['logic']
Testability,"I see. Yes, I think this is closer to the issue at hand -- for instance, we'll have variants that are called, then when we go back to the original alignments there will be no indication of alternate observations at the loci which the variants were called (and vice versa, we'll have original alignments that suggest a variant, but won't get called). In the worst cases scenarios, the haplotype alignments seem ridiculous compared to the original reads (e.g. my GATK forum post: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/community/posts/360075749392-Bamout-haplotypes-are-much-worse-than-bamout-tumor-reads-would-suggest). So, right, it's not the realignment of the reads, it's the alignment of the assembled haplotypes that complicates things. Thinking about it in this context though, I see we might be at an impasse (or back at square one with considering the assembly process). . My true fear is that we'll lose what appear to be definite-somatic variants in the original alignments because of the internal assembly + haplotype alignment engine. But I will say, it does seem like we see these problems for lower-coverage areas/variants, so I might be exaggerating the issue at hand. Maybe the solution for testing our expectations is to use higher depths to avoid bad assemblies and to apply some post-processing to the calls.

I divided the PRs for the `IndelRealignment` into 4 different sections for better review (2 components of indel-realignment, `RealignerTargetCreator`and `IndelRealignment`). This strategy is because I dissected the pipeline into the easy `RealignerTargetCreator` to found regions worth to look at (this could be marked as experimental/beta before the indel-realignment is in) and the more complicated and component-based `IndelRealigner` (the same as with other tools, this can be marked as experimental/beta until a really good coverage is achieved - in the meantime, I have some test with the current data in the repository and the GATK3 counterpart). There are two parts that are usable outside `IndelRealigner` that are worthy to separate into two commits, and might be useful for other tools/downstream projects: `ConstrainedMateFixingManager` and `NWaySAMFileWriter`. That's the reason of making the port in split PRs. One option can be to have the PRs open, and reviewed independently without acceptance until every component is ready.

The classes in `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.utils.read.markduplicates.sparkrecords` are replaced with a single ""union"" type `MarkDuplicatesSparkSqlRecord`, that can represent all of them (it uses a `type` field to indicate which is stored). To test, I ran `MarkDuplicatesSpark` before and after the change on a cluster on exome-sized data. . Before: 7.32 minutes; After: 7.43 minutes. So there was no significant difference in runtime with this change. This is probably because the part of `MarkDuplicatesSpark` that was changed is the `group by` on fragment/pair key, which actually is a fairly small part of the total runtime of MD; the rest is a shuffle to ensure the input data is queryname sorted.

Testability,"I tried to do it, and I'm afraid that it won't be trivial as I expected: because it is a facade, there is not accesibility to `Logger.setLogLevel()` and this is required to set the verbosity level in the command line. After explore a bit the code, it seems that [`LoggingUtils`](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/src/main/java/org/broadinstitute/hellbender/utils/LoggingUtils.java) is the only place where a concrete implementation should be used. My suggestion is to move this class to a package that could be excluded by the backend user (because it contains methods to change the logging of log4j, I suggest `org.apache.logging.log4j`), which implements a simple interface/abstract class `org.broadinstitute.hellbender.utils.LoggingUtils` to set the log level (LoggingUtils.setLoggingLevel(final Log.LogLevel verbosity)`. The default implementation (that could be used by final users callid`super.setLoggingLevel(final Log.LogLevel verbosity)`) could setup the htsjdk and the java.util.logger.Logger. This implementation requires to change the `CommandLineProgram` to have a setter for the `LoggingUtils` to use, that could be set in `Main` (as in my PR for improve the extensibility of this class). The only pronblem is that it requires to be initialize with a simple implementation class of `LoggingUtils`, which should use the default. I think that this design does not break the behaviour of GATK, but introduce more complexity in the code. If you think that this is worthy, I could implement it today. @lbergelson, I'm not able to run Spark tools in a cluster yet, neither in gcloud dataproc, sorry.

Testability,"I was mistaken about this not being faster - I was using a counting function that Spark can optimise by pulling onto the map side so that the records don't go through the shuffle. I changed this to simply dump the processed reads so they have to go through the shuffle, and I got the following timings when processing a 121GB BAM file.; - With shuffle: 27 min; - No shuffle (two scans over input): 24.7 min (8% saving); - No shuffle (one scan over input): 17 min (37% saving). The version that does two scans is faster, but not hugely so. Removing a scan is possible, but requires the use of a sequence dictionary to find the end points of contigs. I've done this in the latest version of my branch (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/compare/tw_overlap_partitioner), but there are more edge cases to test. Before I do this, however, it would be worth trying this approach with the Haplotype Caller to see if it works, and if it is appreciably faster.

Testability,"I would like to reiterate that the one code path in ADAM that is. 1. changed between 0.20.0 and 0.23.0 and; 2. that is used in both the GATK BQSR and HC engines. is the two bit file parsing and extraction engine. The main commit that changed in that code path was https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam/commit/1eed8e8e464f8f92a6e87afc1d334e751423e810, which reverts cleanly on ADAM trunk. There are also some changes in the `ReferenceRegion` class, they appear to be mostly cosmetic, but this necessitated changing one parameter from `null` to `Strand.INDEPENDENT` in https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/commit/8a366c7ba570c61338f7109b86c3284b80d5cf47. The GATK does one lookup into the TwoBitFile (which creates one ReferenceRegion along the way) per read during BQSR and two per assembly region during HC, so this code is inside your inner loop. Again, all it should take to test this hypothesis is:. ```; git clone git@github.com:bigdatagenomics/adam.git; cd adam; git checkout adam-parent-spark2_2.10-0.23.0; git revert 1eed8e8e464f8f92a6e87afc1d334e751423e810; mvn install -DskipTests; ```. You'd then need to build the GATK with the JAR this generates. If this makes the perf regression go away, then we can easily revert this change in ADAM 0.24.0, which will release two weeks from now.

Testability,I'd be happy to run/write additional tests if anyone suggests any.,MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1213#issuecomment-161712678:37,test,tests,37,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/1213#issuecomment-161712678,1,['test'],['tests']
Testability,I'd like to do the shuffle changes in a separate PR. I've also disabled the tests with unpaired read failures for the time being so we can merge this.

Testability,"I'd like to leave it open until we get the fixes to #365 and add a test then that verifies that. However, I don't think this needs to be for alpha.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/766#issuecomment-159657232:67,test,test,67,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/766#issuecomment-159657232,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"I'd like to test this out. @tedsharpe could you add your ""contigNameToMoleculeName"" file to the /broad-dsde-methods/sv/reference/GRCh38 bucket, perhaps along with a little README note on how you created it? It'd also be nice if you could update the scripts in scripts/sv in github (I think you'd have to change svDiscover.sh and scanBam.sh) to correctly pass this along.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2527#issuecomment-289044888:12,test,test,12,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/2527#issuecomment-289044888,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"I'd rather keep the message more generic, and think of the check as simply defining what a valid `CopyRatio` object can be: an interval associated with a finite double value. One might imagine that someone would try to create such an object that does not originate from a BAM (perhaps for test data, or for imputing missing values in pre-existing data, etc.). This check says that they must create it with some finite value. A more appropriate place for the sort of message you suggest is in the relevant denoising method. In the edge case you encountered, you used a BAM that was almost completely uncovered in all bins at the specified resolution, resulting in a sample median of zero. Since one of the steps in standardization is dividing by the sample median, this results in a divide by zero. I've added the corresponding check.",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4292#issuecomment-365726746:289,test,test,289,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4292#issuecomment-365726746,1,['test'],['test']
Testability,"I'd rather not change the default HC behavior, but this is pretty exciting because we can lay the argument about porting ReadBackedPhasing to rest. It would be good to do a comparison with RBP -- can you take a look at the RBP integration tests from GATK3 to see if there was a MNP test there?",MatchSource.ISSUE_COMMENT,broadinstitute,gatk,4.6.0.0,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4650#issuecomment-380816090:239,test,tests,239,https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk,https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/pull/4650#issuecomment-380816090,2,['test'],"['test', 'tests']"
